As an experiment, I went and spent an hour in RM killing HG's for cash 
tonight.

Mind you, this is from starting at the entrance to the HG area itself, 
with a pet already summoned, geared up, buffed up, bags summoned and empty.

65 mage, self buffed, using WoX (61 air pet) with tier one focus 
(summoner's boon), pet gear kit, burnout V, 48 point DS, Velocity (pet 
only SOW)

I went in and killed steadily for the entire hour, tossed coppers 
occaisionally but kept everything else, literally everything.  This 
meant I was encumbered halfway thru the hour due solely to the silvers 
and golds.  Running around on run 3 this did slow me down a bit gradually.

At any rate, I looted HG's, Giant Skeletons and Cyclops', left the 
lizardmen and basilisks rot.  I could kill the skellies and clops in one 
shot with firebolt, nearly so the HG's.  Pet could kill them all in 
under 30 seconds unassisted.  Often I'd toss pet at something and go 
nuke something else.

Gated out at the 1 hour mark, so the entire hour I'm counting was spent 
killing and looting.

Sold everything I looted with my cha kit on for full vendor price, then 
converted everything into pp at the bank.

Result? 610pp.

While some HG dropped as much as 41 pp, many dropped no pp at all, just 
56 gp etc.  About half dropped a FS weapon worth another 5pp.  Cyclops 
were worth an average of 2pp, skellies about 1pp.

Mana was not an issue, I did manage to go thru it slowly, but even when 
I got seriously into nuking stuff that the pet could have killed I only 
managed to drop slowly down to 40% mana.

My running speed could have been better; str buff, SOE, maybe dumping 
the silver (although 12pp of the cash was in silver)

I might have done better with a fast small pulling bolt loaded, 
Firebolt's cast time meant I lost some mobs to the competition even 
though I cast first.  Bolts at least have the advantage of range, 
though, and of not having the LOS issues that Black Steel or my classic 
pulling tool, cancel magic, had.

What I don't see is how I can realistically hope to more than double 
this loot gathering rate, unless perhaps the zone is empty.  I doubt the 
changes I'm thinking of would really end up even doing that much, more 
like 750pp an hour.  3kpp an hour?  I'm thinking perhaps some other 
class.  Or perhaps I'm thinking thats an exaggeration.
