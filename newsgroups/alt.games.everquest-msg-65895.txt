Read a official posting stating that the casting bar for bards is
supposed to be there.  Its been so long since I played a bard
that I can't think whether this would actually be helpful or
not.  I suppose if it doesn't lag at all, it -would- be beneficial,
I seem to recall a bit of a learning curve on timing when
each spell effect actually begun, and I never had to face real
spam problems that a multigroup raid would engender.

On the other hand, I -liked- that it was necessary to develop
at least a primitive feel for rythm in order to play a bard
well... almost like some form of musical talent was at play!
