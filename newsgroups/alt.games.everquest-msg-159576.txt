Last years is a tough one to top, least they could have done was just
patch that one back in, Rathe and Wk were great. Well designed to keep
ubers from being the spoilers they were in WC and Nro. Multi zone
events so 500 people weren't all piled into the same zone lagging it
out or even worse crashing it; which is what tends to happen in the
Werewolf Wc event. Great items for mid level players. A high end MoB
or two for Ubers. More then a single day so you could enjoy it if you
had to work halloween.

Give me last years event, no GM required, would rather a GM not be
part of it as it usually leads to mass murder of lower level
characters till the "uber friends" show up to clear the GM controlled
MoB out.

As for where are the GMs, there are threads going around from a month
or two ago that said verant cut back on GMs, cost cutting. Could be
why halloween event is so lame; simple cost cutting.


Then again even numbered EQ halloween events have been half ass.

First year undead invasion of Qeynos hills.

Second year werewolf invasion of Wc that ended in zone crash

Last year Rathe, WK, WC, Nro, Undead invasion of QHill.

This year Level 70 Dragon in Swamp of no hope and drakes in Lake of
Ill Omen. Maybe even werewolf invasion, but wasn't going on when I was
there.
