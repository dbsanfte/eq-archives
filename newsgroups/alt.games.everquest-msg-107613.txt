Probably a lot of giant toes and heads...

I like it, all the huge hallways.

Yes but be careful there's a ton of stuff a little ways in that aren't
on CoV that you'll *never* be non-kos to.


> Can I run 
>freely around Western Wastes?

No, theres some things that aggro everyone. Also keep an eye on what
dragon you're approaching. Escorpa is on Ring of Scale, not Claws of
Veeshan, and I forget if Klandicar is on CoV or not.

I think its kinda neat there's an RoS dragon in WW. They don't really
spell out very well the relationship between Phara Dar's group and the
CoV. When VP gets upgraded I hope they just beef the existing dragons,
not kill them in some historic sense.


> What other awesome touristic opportunities 
>does the friendship of Dragons grant me?

Hrm. You nailed most of them I think. Hours of fun in the halls of
testing, maybe? And wasting Tormax of course.

CONGRESSMAN:  "These reports undoubtedly prove that your product makes
    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
