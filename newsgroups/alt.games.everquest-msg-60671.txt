If you're grouping with 55+ guildies hunting drakes, and they're not
looking for epic drops, maybe you need a new guild.  Or accept that
they're not that into powergaming and enjoy the companionship.

What level are your groups?  I've generally found that KC is really
decent exp for groups starting about level 49.  The downside is that
it's the bridge zone for people who have done nothing but outdoor
fighting all their lives, ding from 48 to 49 in Dreadlands, and see it
green out too much, so into KC they go.  That being said I don't think
a single group 50ish could really keep all entrance, moat, and moat
ledge mobs clear, just because of how many mobs there are in the moat.

>And I've been in groups where we've easily taken both the LCY and the RCY.

Yeah, a good group can do it, as long as there is a group up above
camping the battlements or you sit in the RCY.  Sitting in the LCY
with people pulling from above is annoying at best, and sometimes
suicidal.
>That leaves a tower group, and a basement group.

Ummm, that leaves a tower group, and a battlements group, and a
warlord group, and a hand group, and a basement group, plus there
could be a group clearing the VS room.  (On Innoruuk for some reason
the towers are the west side, the battlements are the east side, it's
possible that they are one camp on other servers.)

I think KC can handle 8 groups easily, and that's with one group doing
corners/moat and one doing CYs.  I've been in there when there were 60
people and except for right at zone-in, track was still full of mobs.

Huh?  I really don't think anyone higher than level 53 is getting that
much exp in the average KC pickup group.  Most of the basement is
still true-blue at 53, but anywhere else, short of WL, you're going to
be seeing a LOT of cyan.  And I don't want to sound harsh, but if that
is what you think 'high level' life is, you really need to get out
more.  Since 50 I have solod or grouped in Permafrost, Lower Guk,
Naggy's Lair, Rathe Mtns (halloween events), Kedge, Lesser Faydark,
The Hole, BW, Chardok, City of Mist, Dreadlands, Emerald Jungle,
Fironia Vie, KC, Sebilis, Skyfire Mtns, Traks Teeth, Cobalt Scar,
Dragon Necropolis, EW, GD, Siren's Grotto, Velks Lab, Wakening Land,
Tower of Veeshan, and all 5 planes.  This doesn't include the places
I've gone to kill one mob for an epic drop or something.  At the very
least take your group up to Chardok just for a damn change of pace.

still has HS, VP, and ST to do
