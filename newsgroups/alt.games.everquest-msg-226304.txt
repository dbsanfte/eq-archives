Dunno, they just may, simply because you have to kill more mobs before the
timer runs out.  If you finish a mission in 35 minutes (plus 30 min until
you're booted), you're most likely going to get more XP than someone who
finishes in 75 min (+30).  That's my problem with collects, they finish
before I'm ready to leave.

Of course, I don't know this first-hand, since every time I head over to get
a mission, my group yells out "No assasinations or rescues!"  Hai, hai...
