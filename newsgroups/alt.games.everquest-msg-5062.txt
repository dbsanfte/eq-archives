I thoroughly enjoy my human monk, but I have to admit regen, forage, higher
AC, and nightsight would be nice. I like being a good guy though, so I had
to pick the human :)

One of my traveling companions is a dark elf Necro, so that gets interesting
at times. I accidentally beat a Erudite guard to death the other night when
he jumped the Necro.  Doh!
