There's a similar trick I use to bank in Kelethin with my barb warrior. 

1. Move around to the side of the bank, getting as close to the banker on the
other side of the wall as possible.

2. F9 to get to third-person viewpoint.

3. Pan/zoom the view around until you can see the banker in the window.

4. Click on him.

Maybe you can do something similar?
