Not for HP's. But I heard there's a hard impact for melees, if your
stamina reaches 0 with heavier weapons if your STA is less than 100.

There is stacking. The luclin buff 'Harness of spirit' (lvl 49)
gives you 67 STR and 50 DEX, and they stack with the STR/DEX line
of spells, if they are casted after harness. I brought several
people to 255 this way (not starting at 120, but slightly over it).

: Second, the amount of mana you would need to burn to get that level of
: boost (unless you somehow obtained a primal weapon), is a pretty big
: waste.

Er, no. Granted, it uses a bit of mana, but the spells stay on for more
than an hour. That's not exactly a huge mana burn. Unlike your
primal avatar mentioned below. That one is a huge mana eater at
250 mana and just 1 minute staying alive.

: Third, you pretty much have to get some of that increase in DEX from
: items and that usually means you have to swap out some other
: potentially meaningful stats for them.  

You can get nearly everything out of items .. haste, healing, nukes
etcs. That never made the classes casting them obsolete, though.

: Generally, worrying about DEX is a bad idea.  Just concentrate on the
: critical stats and let the rest fall where it will.

I think getting STR for a warrior through items is very trivial ... at
least so far I think it is for my warrior. I don't know about dex.
But considering I have this Donjonxyzmolinar axe, which is a 33dmg
44 delay weapon with a 140 DD proc at *level 1*, dex can make me level
in no time :)

: I'm proccing more".  I felt the same way when I got primal avatar
: tossed on me.  I checked the log, it was a 3% difference with a +100
: DEX.  Damn fine use of mana there...

I'd not use that spell. Why would you? Harness/focus and the statbuff
line use up a similar amount, but stay MUCH longer. This basically
makes avatar only cool for the ATK component. And unless *that* is
making you a lot better, that spell is truly a mana waste at 1 minute
duration.

: Hell, I had a far bigger increase in overall proc count by just
: getting Shissared....but then that should have been obvious.

Sure ... dex isn't primarly there for massiv eproccing .. it only helps.
Then again, I really would like to know the exact inner workings of
how and where what is being used. The generic descriptions don't help
there.

:>For me, anyways :) Saves me a lot of work. But you didn't explain why.
:>Because of the ATK component? 

: Instead of whiffing and connecting for 10's and 20's, I connect more
: often and connect for more damage.  That +100 ATK is like 3 or 4 extra
: levels worth of offensive skill increases.  

Ha. I must check weather one of the high level spells gives you ATK only.
I guess none. 

:>Wouldn't call it idiot meleers. It does have an effect.

Lol, right. I forgot the actual thread.
