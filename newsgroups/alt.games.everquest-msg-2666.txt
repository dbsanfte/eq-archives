As an SK, I can tell you that your lowest level pets are quite useless.  Even at
higher levels they are litle more than a DoT.  Your pet wont dual wield until
late 40's early 50's.  Most importantly, when you're pulling, use the /pet guard
here, so that he doesn't follow you into the dungeon and aggro everything in
sight.  Speaking of pulling, when you get feign death, practice the fine art of
fd pulling.  With a bit of work, you can fd pull more effectively than monks.
