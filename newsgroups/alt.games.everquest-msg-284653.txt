hey,

i just got a lappy and i put EQ on it ... and it ran alright, but then, just 
recently - i guess since the new patcher's skin came about, the one 
advertising serpent's spine - the patcher won't load

the tiny screen that comes up instead of the patcher comes up and freezes on 
main.png-something or whatnot ... you know what i mean, right?

anyway,

how the hell do i patch the patcher? what files are those? i'd like to just 
copy the relevant files from my pc to the lappy (and not the whole 
directory) ...

thanks in advance for the help =)


p.s. i'm a wizard now~
