Yup, crappy sound with SBLive.  I understand you get the same problem with
most good cards.

Yup, I had minor problems with video with my GeForce2 MX, but it didn't
bother me much at all...dunno though, perhaps it's like the cure for a
headache...STOMP on the person's big toe...the headache is quickly
forgotten.

I hate WinMe though, if you have 98SE (or 98) laying around, I'd go with
that.  I DO love Win2k though!! If it weren't for the fact that the only
thing I do on my home computer is EQ I'd be default booting into it.
