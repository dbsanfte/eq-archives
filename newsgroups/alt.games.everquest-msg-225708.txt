Not going to happen as the characters have already invested in the
tradeskill, the skill itself costs nothing to maintain and is not traded for
traded off or sold. They can take it up where they left off at a moments
notice -  they will proberly even have a larger supply of trade skill
components when they re-enter the market later on as well. Unlike real
businesses with huge operating costs you cannot force people out of the
market in EQ's economy in the long term because as soon as conditions turn
favourable again they just pick again where they left off without skipping a
beat.

You can of course lower your price and capture an entire market in EQ (up to
the capacity of your trade skill components capacity) - but you cannot later
on raise your price and reap the benefits of keeping the acquired market
share. You will also have a great deal of difficulty maintaing the required
amount of trade skill components for aggressive discounting. In the long
term it corrects itself, and the biggest benefit is to the end consumer who
has the patience to wait for a bargain.
