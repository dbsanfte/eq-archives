First off, if you hit the "Shift" key, found at either side of your
keyboard, you will be able to start all of your sentences with capitol

Great.  Verant are theives now.  At least you have perspecitive.

Let's play the number game again.  First off, the total down time in
the last week is what, 13 hours (8 hours Wednesday, 3?  30 days in a
month and 24 hours in a day equals 720 hours a month.  Or roughly 1.8%
of the time this month the game has been totally unavailable to play.
So, just for this month, you're looking at an uptime of 98.2%.

So, 1.8% of your $12.95 a month would be about $.23.  

Yes.  I can indeed see how you would get all riled up about being
taken like that by big, mean ol' Verant.

>almost every service i use
>will pay for the downtime except those thie.. Individuals at Verant.

If I felt this way about a company I'd, oh I don't know, STOP GIVING
THEM MONEY!!!
