Jeremy was joking -
Manastones no longer drop, they
allow you to trade HP for Mana at a
2:1 ratio (50 hp ->25 mana) IIRC.

VI decided they were unbalancing and
stop their drops, and made them not
work in new content.

The reasoning was that a cleric with
complete heal could regenerate
mana too quickly.  As I recall, there is
no casting time on the stone.
