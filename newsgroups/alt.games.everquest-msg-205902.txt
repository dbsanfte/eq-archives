I'm just curious; evil races who wanted to go to SRO or Upper Guk and
had the PoP expansion could just take the PoK book to Innothule Swamp,
which is next to both of those zones.  Of course, now Innothule and
Grobb (now Gukta) have been taken over by the Frogloks, but the book
is far enough away from the Gukta entrance so evils wouldn't have to
worry about the Froglok guards.  However, I'm just wondering if there
are any other new mobs in Innothule that will KOS evil races that
players will have to watch out for on their way to SRO or Upper Guk,
or is the Innothule book still safe to use for evil races?

Thanks in advance,
