I've never heard of a puller who didn't want to stay out in front of the mobs,
instead of taking slaps in the back all the way home.

And I can think of very few places where running will get you in to more trouble
when you have FD... Getting to a safe spot and then dropping for a little rest
is a common plan.

Even if such places exist, you'd have to ONLY like working in them to have Run
not be better than.. well, "slower than mobs"
