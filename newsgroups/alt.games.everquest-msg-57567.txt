 I know, I hate it when people complain about top posting. If it's a long quote
I top post and the reader can refer below. If it mostly fits on one page, I 
bottom post.
 
 Used to be that everyone top posted (10 - 12 years ago) but at some point 
the preference switched with most people and now you get jumped and harassed
for the simple act of posting where it's convenient to read. I prefer to read
post on top and quotes on the bottom (to refer to if I don't know what was
posted previously). I hate haveing to hit page down 6 times past what I just 
read to see what the NEW post is. Backwards if you ask me. But oh well.   8^/
