I think they should be larger. I've heard they used to be, is this true?
After all death is supposed to represent well..death but obviously you cant
have everybody who dies returning to level 1 but experince loss should be
greater imo. This would make the game more exciting and challenging. my
character isnt high level so forgive the above if exp loss is horrendous post
30 but i currently lose a couple of blue and this musters no more than a "Dang"
from me as it will take 20 minutes to recoup this, give or take.
On a side note: whats your record for staying alive? how long between deaths?
personally mine is pitiful having died at least 4 or 5 times every level,
probably 1 or 2 rl hours when im doing something boring like farming bone
chips.
