   If you don't care, and know that you don't know, then what does it
matter what gender they pick for their avatar?  I mean, unless you have a
compulsion to give money and items to every woodelf female that you see,
what does it matter what the gender of the player is?  I will say that I
think it it is shameful when I see female avatars batting their virtual
eyes and heaving their pixelated bosoms in hopes of being given gifts.  But
I think that it is equally distasteful regardless of the real gender of the
player.


> Would you count the rapist, Madonna, or the U.S. "P" as your friends?


   Yes, I would.  Because I feel that there are different levels of
friendships that one can have.  I have my friends from work, my friends
from this newsgroup, my hunting friends in EQ, and my neighbors whom I chat
with from time to time.  Then there is my best friend, whom I also
married.  Some, obviously, I know better than others.  Some I can count on
for a heck of a lot more than others.  But they are all my friends.


> Surely not, you don't know them at all..

  Surely yes, because I do know them from the context of EQ.

    That's fine.  We have different comfort levels, I guess.  For all I
know, one of my friends from work might stomp on puppies for fun, I don't
know.  My neighbors might have a fully functional S&M dungeon in their
basement.  I don't know these things, and until I find out I don't really
care.  I assume the best of people until given a reason to think otherwise.

   I suspect that the real problem here that you and I define friendship
differently.  And no, I'm not real inclined to start digging out the
dictionary and pointing at what it says.  But it is clear to me that you
hold your friendships to be more serious than I do.  

   Um.. not that I don't have some serious friendships.
