Oh come on now, you're just sounding silly here.  This might possibly
be true if all the Everquest worlds were just single computers, but
since each 'server' is actually a collection of server, it just
doesn't make sense.  
Think about it logically.  Verant has been saying 400,000 users for
quite a while now, The general wisdom is that the server numbers were
removed when usage had peaked right before the release of DAoC.  I
think most people would say that their servers were down about 5-10%
in the 2-3 months before they removed server numbers.  Verant has not
increased the 400,000 subscriber number in any press release, and if
it was 450,000 they would be announcing that everywhere.  There have
been no new servers for quite some time now, other than special rules
servers.  The special rules servers have the lowest populations, other
than AB, which generally absorbed experienced players from other
servers, and it appears to be pretty underpopulated.  So it's pretty
obvious that the servers have pretty much stayed at consistant
population levels in the past several months.
In addition, I think it's pretty obvious based on interviews in
technical magazines that Verant had to ADD servers to each server
cluster to deal with the new Luclin zones.  So for each physical
'server', you have basically the same number of people and more CPUs
to handle it.  
Now it is possible that with the increase in average character level
that more people are concentrated in certain zones, and that's where
the problem is, but there is certainly nothing to clearly indicate
thise.  There have been highly populated zones working well since the
release of Kunark, LOIO regularly has over 100 people in it, and I
greatly doubt that there has been some new change to the basic
structure of the game in the past 2 months.
Finally, it could be possible that there is a problem with the way the
server engine itself handles all the connections between servers.
This is the only possibility that I can't discount immediately, but I
have seen nothing to suggest it IS occuring either.  What I am seeing
is people disconnecting at peak times and off-peak; in large raids and
pick-up groups and guild groups; in populated zones and empty zones.
I don't think I'm seeing any more disconnects, and for me personally
I've experienced it less.  Enough people *are* reporting it that it's
probably happening.  Let's work to figure out exactly what the
situation is so that we can provide useful information via /bug and
developers forums.
