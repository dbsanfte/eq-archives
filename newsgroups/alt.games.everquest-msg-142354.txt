Oh.  So it's bias when you don't agree with the presentation, but
"flat fact" when you do?  In short, you're unable to look beyond
your own prejudices.

Free clue:  Paladins share the cleric spell lines.  Druids/shaman don't.
Paladins are, by definition, a "part" cleric.  It's *inherent* that they
would be "closer to clerics" than ANY other class.  That is "flat fact"
as well.

See, it IS all point-of-view.  The same as any two facts which are
seemingly in conflict, but which merely reflect different aspects.

Here, try to follow this:  A ripe, Red Delicious apple is red.  The
majority of fire engines in the USA are red.  An apple is a fruit.
An orange is a fruit.

You're arguing that "an apple is closer to a fire engine than an
orange."  And, viewing from color, that IS true, is it not?   Other
people are arguing "an apple is closer to an orange than a fire
engine."  Viewing from the point of view of what they "are," that's
true as well, correct?

Now are you going to argue that an apple isn't red?  Or an apple isn't
a fruit?  Or that a fire engine isn't red?  Or that an orange isn't a
fruit?   Apparently so, as long as you've fixated upon which aspect of
the apple YOU want to compare just as you've fixated upon which aspect
of the cleric you want to compare.
