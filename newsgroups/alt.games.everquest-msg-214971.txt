Solo is fun, but you don't have to give it up to group.  Group half the time,
solo the rest.  Benefits of grouping; you meet new friends, you try different
tactics, you get to do harder things, and if all goes well you get better
loot and experience.  Benefits of soloing; you don't have to deal with all
the jerks and losers out there, you get to work at your own pace, and things
don't have to go all that well to get loot and experience; a bad group can
easily be a net loss.

If you are up front about being a newbie, being new to grouping in
particular, most people will be more than happy to have you along and try and
help you learn.  There aren't that many genuine newbies left in this world,
and its a pleasure to be able to demonstrate your superiority by having a
willing victim, er, audience, no thats not it, Student, thats the word.

What really bugs us old pros is when someone comes on as if they know what
they are doing, manages to fake it for a while, then turns into an utter
bonehead when the chips are down.

And there's always something to learn.  I could have sworn on a stack of
Tomes that it was impossible to have both Eye of Zomm and a pet up at the
same time.  Wizards had the edge as scouts because of this, after all, they
never have a pet up to interfere with their eye, and until a mage gets the
ability to make his pet vanish into some dimensional hole to be called out
later, he's going to have to kill pet just to scout.   Turns out I'm wrong.
How this got in my head I'll never know, was it the case three years ago when
I was playing my first mage?  Or have I always been wrong?

Druids actually group fairly well, serving as backup healer, snarer, DSer,
nuker, DOTTer, and evac, and SOW outdoors... yes, there are more group
oriented classes, and druid as sole healer is a difficult position to be in
(still not untenable), but unless you are looking at hardcore Min/Maxers, you
should be able to group happily.
