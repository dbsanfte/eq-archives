Damn, i just want my fair share of rolls, and my fair share of the loot, 
i dont want extra for dots. i have always made close enough to pay my 
dot cost...I dont even normally like the 'first gem goes to the cleric' 
deal.
aru
hm, last night, used 9 dots [temped pets too=)] and made 1 augment, 1 
jacinth and 24 plat...would have been 200 plat, but since I am a 
jeweler, I wanted the jacinth for a seal I am making for a friend=) We 
had 3 augments and a bunch of gem drops. IIRC, 1 diamond, 1 jacinth, 3 
sapphires, 2 rubies and 3 fire emeralds. I cant wait for some of the new 
tradeskill recipes to come out=)
