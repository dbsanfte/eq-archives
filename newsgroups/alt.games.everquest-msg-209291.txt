Was an experience the last time I did it.  Was commenting in AGE channel
about it, and "wouldn't it be cool if Lodi popped as we were doing the
event!".  The general reply to that was, "but then you'd lose the shawl
war!"

So the general got stuck near ToFS. If we agrod him and took him to his next
spot, he'd just go back on blur, and get stuck again.

So while were milling around wondering what to do, I notice a certain
creature just popped!  We kill lodi, then finally 5 mins later, Mr. General
becomes unbugged and were able to finish the quest.

He got stuck twice that run, would h8 to think that some people didn't stick
around long enough for him to fix himself, though!
