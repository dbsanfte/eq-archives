No, no mistake. In BB (Blackburrow) from the rest area drop left off the
bridge and go under Elite Ledge, there are 2 doors there, the one on the
right is down a slope, use this one then drop off the ramp in there...in the
corner of the room is a transporter crystal.
What I don't know is where abouts in Jagged Pine you go, when you zone in
you are in a cave system of some sort and not the same spot as from the
Surefall Crystal. I didn't exlore as I was hunting in Blackburrow so the
characters I was playing were not of the level that would have lasted long
in Jagged Pine.
