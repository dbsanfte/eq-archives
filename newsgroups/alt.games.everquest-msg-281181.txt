And that IMO is one of the main problems with WOW and to some extent EQ2.

Because it is so easy to solo, nobody groups. There is no sense of 
community. Even in the guilds I was in it seemed like you did not really 
have a guild, you had a private chat channel for 250 solo players that would 
occasionally group up to farm something and then all go their own way again.

Been there, done that, and I am back in EQ1 again and liking it much better 
than either of the others.
