AH! Much becomes clear!

Since you just got Dual-Wield, your skill in it is low.   This means you
will not get very many successful skill checks on it, so your 2ndary weapon
will not 'fire' too often.

Also, your skill with the piercing weapon is very low. This means your ATK
with the weapon is also low, so your chances of successfully hitting are
also very low.

In short, you forget to dual-strike a lot, and when you do remember you
whiff a lot :-)

Just keep at it, and it will come along, as far as you want it to go.  If
you want to shortcut it a bit, you could spend some skill training points
with a Bard-Guild leader, if you have any available.
