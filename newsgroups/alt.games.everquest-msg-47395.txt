AHAH i always forget the 100 skill in swimming "benefit."
Honestly though that is nice, mostly because you can fall into the
water often in Cab. When I made a shaman barb newbie.. not wanting to
wait for their little boat thing (wouldn't they have built a bridge by
now???) I swam and BOY do you swim SLOOOWWW as a newb with no swim
skill.

Ah I did find a good use for the 100 swimming though. An iksar at
level 9 (or really even less) can swim out to the overthere boat of
its own power, with no other player's help. It can then go to
timorous, find a druid or someone killing watchmen ogres and ask to
loot a spectacles (useless to them) in exchange for 20 batwings and 20
fish scales (easy for an iksar to buy at newbie areas outside cab) and
an eduring breath with lev if they would please also then run down and
also buy the no drop drink from the hidden bar thing and gate back to
cab. Voila, if it has the money for the gem it now has the shaman
iksar quest bp which is pretty dang good. I actually found that to be
the easiest iksar shaman quest armor piece, sure beats the heck out of
the totemic bp quest ;)

However its kind of moot because like the troll you take the 20
percent penalty for regen mostly. On my troll I always think of it
like this to put it in a postive light:

I get XP ONE FIFTH slower.

I heal ONE HALF faster. 

So when my troll sk solos I'm still ahead of the game as far as
downtime with someone with ZERO xp penalty and ZERO regen. Even at
level 32 sitting to med for a while when I'm OOM I usually fully heal
also. So I'm happier than if it was a dark elf.
