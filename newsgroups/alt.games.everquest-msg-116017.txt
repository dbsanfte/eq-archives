Although I don't like the term, I prefer to call them more appropriately
what they are, just as "characters".  That's not too sounding as if I'm
taking the game seriously...not any more serious than a book, movie, TV
show, or other video game.  Toons tend to be thought of as animations, hand
drawn, these are computer rendered collections of polygons (I don't know how
they got the name, because it doesn't describe them, but yesterday afternoon
I saw a wolf by the name of "Octagon".)

Also I'd like to add that today my DE Necro saw one of the most beautiful
sites I've seen in a long time, which I just had to get a screenshot of.
