I assume you have a DSL or Cable connection since
you listed your system as not having a dial up modem installed.

To narrow down your problem to your system or connection
try to see if you can set up your computer at a friend's house
to try your system on his connection.

If you still have the same problem then its your system if not
then its your connection/ ISP.

The other thing to try is to go to this site and run the connection
diagnostics they have, it really helped my connection problems:

Go to the 'Our Tools' section and run some tests. Try to do it late
at night or early morning when the site is less busy.
