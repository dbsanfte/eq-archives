Well not quite on the arses, but we will have to come back to that. The best
WWII book Is "WW II " written by Martin Gilbert, who is an Oxford Don.
Tremendous book !

Excellent book. Famous for the Quote when the journalist asked " How can you
kill women and children" the helicopter doorgunner replied  laconically  and
sarcastically - " Its easy  - you just lead them a little less"

Not familiar with that one. Was it good?
 But. for the other side, you might want to try ( if available) " Peoples
War Peoples Army" by Gen. Giap ( Giap was the General that defeated the
French and fought the US. Real chilling book - starts off - " 100,000
casualties mean nothing."
Also older books such as " Street Without Joy" and "Hell in a Very Small
Place the story of Dien Bien Phu" give very good pictures of the French
invlolvement. As an aside, there was actually a time when the french were
winning the war - they had simply lost the will to continue.

Excellent book - read it some time ago - it has become popular again due to
Mel Gibsons movie.

There are always those:
The best left on Viet Nam are:

" A Bright Shining Lie"
" Tet"
 and just for kicks " Sniper" about Carlos Hathcock.

Well to be honest it has been some time since I have read about Korea and my
memory dims. The only other book I can really recommend is "MacArthur an
American Caesar." which details his invovlement with Korea. My second boss
fought there and told me some hairy tales.
There are a number of other new books on Korea that really appear
interesting though.

Yes those books are much more interesting than others. I like them too. But
since I have to periodically clean out my library - my wife insists (
heartless bitch) - I have donated ( cry) a large number of books to the
public library and I am at a loss to give those kind of titles also.

I will attempt to order " This Kind Of War" I have read the other. No macho
aspirations here.

"Afgahnistan - Lifting the Veil " by the staff of Reuters was one of the
books I quoted when I said Al Qaeda controlled Afgahnistan - very good
book - easy to read -and fascinating.

I am reading "Soldiers of God" now by a journalist who was there during the
soviet invasion and war. It is OK.  I have seen the  book you mention, but
it did not peak my interest. Another interesting  book  on Afghanistan is "
The Hidden War" by Borovik " a Russian Journalists Account of the Soviet war
in Afgahnistan. " I have a number of other books in my library on the war
with the soviets in Afghanistan but i cannot recommend them yet as I have
not read them yet. Having American troops in Afghanistan worries me a lot. I
keep thinking of that line from one Rudyard Kiplings barrack ballads - "
when you are lying wounded on the Afghani plains, and the Afghani women come
to cut up your remains, roll on your rifle and blow out your brains." I
would feel better if we brought them home.

"Inside Al Quaeda - Global Network of Terror" by Rohan Gunaratna is the same
book - it is the second book I quoted when I said Al Queda controlled
Afghanistan.

Me too - but always remember - the victor gets to write the history.

I don't suggest they are

Trust me the " Inside Al Queda" book is a real hard dull read. The book is
packed with facts though. It tells how extensive Al Qaeda is. I found it
hard to read. I am a fast reader and it took me some time to read it. It si
a book you have to read a few pages at a time. It was interesting; and I
read to gain some more knowledge of the subject. If I have any reservation
about the book, it might be that it is writen by and an Indian and they are
known for being at odds with moslems. But I do think the author was
objective in his analysis; and he is one of the top experts in the world  on
Al Qaeda. If you find  it an easy read let me know. Then I will think you
are really weird!

I would also like to read more about the Balkans. It reminds me of the
middle east. A real boiling pot where the borders of empires clashed over
the centuries ( Ottoman, Austro- Hungarian, Russian etc). I have passed
several good books up on it because I do not have time right now to read
them. But " Balkan Ghosts" is a real easy and interesting read. Now here is
an interesting sidelight - myself and my best friend ( who is retired
military) thought the US should not have gotten involved in the Balkans. Our
other friend, who is from Ireland, about 65, and now an American citizen,
thought we should. I find that strange. Do you? I just thought it would be
bettter to let the Europeans handle the Balkans. After all, they should know
the history and people better. No I am not trying to start an argument. I am
just asking for your viewpoint on this.

By the way, another book on the other side of the  coin is " The Second
Intifada - Resisting Israel's Apartheid" It has a introduction by Noam
Chomsky who is described as an "intellectual" and a foremost critic of the
US policy. I am really looking forward to reading it and another book titled
" War without End" about the conflict between Israel and the PLO. So yes I
read the other side of the argument - how can you not resist. However, I
always get suspicious of people described as    " intellectuals." Perhaps
because so many lived in Paris during WWII and never lifted a finger to
oppose the Nazi occcupation. I just find that behavior for people, who are
always preaching to others, reprehensible. Give me Winston Churchill over
that any day.

Your friends are obviously not American blacks. But then they must not be
"African Americans" either? If you ever get the chance pick up the book "
Makes Me Want to Holler" for a fascinating but sometimes sad look at the
American black culture written by a black american journalist. And of course
for the foray into Somalia read " Blackhawk Down." It amde me think we
should poke our nose into places like that - regadless of the cicumstances
ie: famine.

Thanks for the tips on the books - nice chat - ciao -good reading to
you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
