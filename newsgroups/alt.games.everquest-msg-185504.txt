I have made ~8-12k (depending on how you value what's on my trader) in
the last 10 days, starting with 800pp, first by buying pelts/hides and
'ling silk cheap (from vendors, or 1pp in the bazaar for silk, <10pp
for hides) and selling high (3pp for silk, 10pp for hides), then
making leather padding out of them (25pp), then moving on to blue
diamonds (buy for 400, sell for 600) and finally to items in the 1k-2k
range that I can sell for 25-50% more. I enjoy the trading, it's fun,
and I don't even know what to do with the money, since I'm only
actively playing a non-twink froglok on that server.

And this is spending maybe an hour or two a day on average buying
stuff. Of course the fact that I sleep during prime time in the US
helps, as I don't have a second computer or account.
