Nice touch! I wish there was a bit more usefulness inherent in the EQ
lowbie quests.  The rewards/incentives for doing low-level Quests in
EQ are far too scanty for the effort involved.

Newbie armour is a waste of time, as with usually less than 5 plat you
can buy a better piece in the bazaar, and the XP gained in GETTING 5
plat (at those levels) far outweighs the XP for the Quest  :D  A
friend of mine did all his Halfling Newbie Armour Quests,  and then
swore off Quests until he wants his Epic  :D

I was particularly cheesed off with the Vah Shir Beastlord newbie
weapon Quest.  I decided to keep at it to see if maybe some Quests
WERE worth doing, and I admit I felt a tinge of pride in making them
both.  Then, when I bought 2 Polished Steel Ulaks for 2.5 plat each I
was just annoyed I'd spent so much time and effort making such paltry
weapons...
