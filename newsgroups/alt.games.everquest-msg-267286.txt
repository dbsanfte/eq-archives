    A fair question.  First let me start by saying that because I do have
mixed feeling about this issue (part of me wants use rat poison and be flat
out done with it, the other, stronger part of me doesn't want to actually
kill anybody or cause serious harm) I might not have been 100% consistent
in this thread.  I haven't gone back and read everything I wrote on the
subject, so if that is the case I apologize.  Now, to your question.  I
think that what I am using as the dividing line is the notion of "Permanent
Harm".  I kinda want to stay away from that.  I don't want to do anything
that might lead to something that the perp might not recover completely
from.    Food poisoning usually, in the large number of cases, will not
cause permanent harm.  But it can sometimes, and I'm not comfortable with
the odds.   I'm sorta wavering on the laxative issue.  Again, the mixed
feelings issue.  Part of me wants to get a hold of some magic drops that
will cause them shit themselves to death, part of me is afraid that if
someone is in compromised health already from something or the other, the
laxatives might somehow tip the balance.  I think this would be a pretty
small chance though, and thusly considered your Visine idea until the
Snopes link was posted.

    Hot sauce?  Yes, the possibility you mention is there.  But even if
that happens, will it permanently harm the person involved?  I don't think
so.  Sure, there is a chance that they might choke to death on the meatball
or something, but then, we face that chance every time we eat anything more
substantial than cereal.  But hot sauce *is* food.  Is is meant to be put
in the human body.  Sure, it will be painful.  That's too fucking bad.  You
steal food, you take you goddamned chances that someone might do something
like this (I don't mean you in particular, btw).

   True enough.  The legalities of this don't bother me too much.  I can't
see someone going to office and saying "I stole a tv dinner from the fridge
and someone dosed it with hot sauce and resealed it!   Food tampering! 
Find them!"

   Again, true enough.  I don't literally think there is going to be
screaming.  Dancing, crying, hooting, or wild arm flapping, perhaps.  But
screaming?  No.  And they might be the stoic type and suffer in silence.

    I'd love for the person to be caught.  But basically, this is a simple
revenge motive for me.  I'm not expecting the office to deal with this
person in any way, so I'm dealing with it in my own.  And I have a mean
streak.

    I'm prepared to booby trap more than one dinner, in more than one way.

    Great story.  I hope he saw you standing there smiling at him before he
closed the door.

   But.. he did stop taking stuff from you.  Your own example supports my
notion that this might work as a deterrent.  I know that the operative word
is "might".  But in my mind, it's certainly better than not doing anything
at all.
