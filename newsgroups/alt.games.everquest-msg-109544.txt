Please don't be condescending.  Nothing has been done that warrants it.

As you noted, a generalization.  I didn't start my halfling druid until I
had played for about 9 months.  Had tried most of the other races and
classes.  Had never tried a halfling nor a druid.

Could be server related, too.  Invariably when I have trouble with a player,
it's either a non-DE necro or a monk of any flavor you care to choose.

/agree regarding the troll warrior and dwarves.  Ogre warrior/SKs as well,
at least on CT.

Pretty much any troll is good on CT ... they're too difficult for the d00dz,
and the people who play them generally have a ball roleplaying them.
