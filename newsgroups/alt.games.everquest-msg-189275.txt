Annie, Annie, Annie.  You are so going about this wrong.  Here, let me 
demonstrate:

Dear Dark Tyger;

Word has reached us that you are a doofus with no friends.  Whilst our 
"Doofus-no-more" classes are all currently full, we do offer friendship 
for the low, low price of $29.95 a month.  For a bit extra, we can 
provide the following:

$5.95 extra per month - post "LOLOLOL", "OMFG you are soooooo right!", 
or any other appropriate response to each and every post you make.
$7.95 extra per month - will keep text files of random quotes and post 
them each and every week to the newsgroups of your choice ($3.95 per 
newsgroup beyond one) under the heading "The Wit & Wisdom of <name>"
$999.95 per month - will change posting name to "I <3 <name>" and change 
sig to "Sign this petition to make me the mother of <name's> baby!!!! 
(extra charges apply for actually attempting/having/caring for/disposing 
of said baby)

Please send us a current credit card number and expiry date and we will 
begin billing immediately.

Sincerely,

-- 
Ryou
