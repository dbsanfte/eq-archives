I only play casters and I've wondered about how fair this is myself.

Sounds reasonable to me (please note, I'm just some shmuck off the street,
not a SOE employee).

Maybe a range of levels - maybe a whole new "con" color for melees.   You'd
have

green - no xps, no skill increase
lavender (used to be higher end greenies) - no xps, but can increase skills.
From what I've heard, you really need a dark blue (versus light blue) to get
a melee skill up, so this would be equivalent of a light blue now.
light blue - equivalent of current dark blue.
blue through red - a bit better than current increases.
