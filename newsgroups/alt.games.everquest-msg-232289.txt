}Yes - but can you give me some examples of your favorites?

Spyglass.  A tinker can make you one for about 20-30pp.
Jboots.  (for a druid? hah. and they only work outdoors.)
Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring. (although I -hate- that camp.)

Those are the classic solutions, really.
There are a couple (Bracer of the Hidden, Bangle of Disease Warding) that 
are targetable rather than self-only.  This is good, in that you can junk 
buff an entire raid rather quickly with them, but bad in that in order to 
refresh your own junk buff, you have to take your target off the mob and 
/assist again.

Personally, I only have Bangle of Disease Warding, and it's never really 
been a problem.  I have half the quest pieces for 
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25145
though.  (Droooool.)
