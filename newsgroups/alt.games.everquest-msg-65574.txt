It wasn't so much a cap at 200 but rather the curve changed at 200, so
that getting over 200 was not worthwhile if you had to give up
anything else to do it.  Of course, getting over 200, so that you'd
stay at 200 when you swapped out int/wis gear for resistance gear was
still good.

Instead of this change, making it keep the same curve to 200, I'd have
preferred something like making int/wis over 200 give no more mana,
but instead have it increase your mana regen rate.
