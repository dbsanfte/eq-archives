If they ever do.   If you ever want to be frustrated, wander around Plane of
Justice sometime, and talk to the prisoners there.   A *ton* of them give
out dialogue, that sounds pretty questlike.  However none of the keywords
are bracketed, so you keep trying 1000 different things to say to him to try
and continue the conversation.

Even when it's obvious that they have more to say... it's still almost
impossible to find the correct phrasing of the exact keywords that will
allow the conversation to continue.  Also, the quest may be bugged and not
responding to the correct words.  (It wouldn't be the first time)  Theres
also no way to tell if they are giving out an actual quest or if you are
just chasing another Burnyai Bunt Cake.

It may very well be "Slay the 7'th hammer"....  but if so, thats a *really*
stupid raid target, considering you have to pass all 6 trials before you can
fight him, but you can get quest flagged for Valor just by passing one.

As a side note, we still haven't gotten flagged for Valor.   Our little
group did however manage to get 5 Spectral parchments to drop in one night.
