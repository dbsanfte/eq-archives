Heck, I've died so often that now *all* of my deaths 
are pretty familiar...  ;-)

Bah!  Too bad I hadn't pumped a larger percentage of my exp
into the AA while it was still "buy one get one free" for us hybrids.

Aarrggh!!  Like it wasn't bad enough already?

If my Paladin wants a bloody horse (RP-wise, shouldn't knights have
horses by default at a certain level, or via a reasonable
quest?), he needs to spend TWENTY THREE alt-exp points
(6 base + 12 arch. + 5 horsie points).  Hell, it'd be
far more time-efficient to just farm items/plat for a while to
earn 110k pp and *buy* a high-end one.

My suggestion:  *lower* the exp needed for an
alt-exp point, then just increase the actual AA point cost
for a few of the "high end" skills/abilities.  But what's
wrong with it being relatively easy to earn a few stat
points at high level?

Thank Brell...  Where this hit me worst was when I zone-crashed.
I would *always* get the "black screen of death", on *any* of my
three computers, when I then tried to get back to the character
select screen.  What a pain.  I'd have to exit to desktop and start
all over if I wanted back in.
