You beat me to it.

Best spell in the cleric's lexicon for a duel... heck, one
of my favorites up thru about level 44, don't think
I spent much time at all without it memmed, and
I hardly ever duel.

Blind is fast, cheap, and astonishingly effective
on player melee characters, most of whom haven't
worked on their archery skills much at all.

I did get my butt handed to me by a warrior buddy
who was so hot with a bow that he kept me from
casting anything at all... including blind.  Turns out
archery will actually turn you to face your target if
you are facing the right general direction, so he
was able to keep me in arc by firing repeatedly.
Soon enough he wasn't blind anymore and a while
after that root wore off... once he got free and
could move in on me it was over pretty quick.

No chance I could have channeled Gate... course
I was a lot younger then, now I doubt there'sn a
warrior out there who could keep me from casting
anything without using slam/bash.
