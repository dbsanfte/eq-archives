Ultima Online had a "newbie" tag that you could wear for (trying to
remember) 10 hours or a certain skill level. This applied to all your
characters, so you were only a newbie once. I'd love to see something like
this in EQ... Imagine how much help THAT character would get.. heck, they'd
probably be in Full FP armor with a planar weapon :)

I agree, Helping out a "real" newbie is one of my greatest pleasures...
anytime I have a velium weapon... I make sure to drop by the old home town
and pass it out... I also make a point to buff up the people hunting around
rivervale... It's hard being a newbie when you can't even hit anything. A
little Skin Like Nature and SoW goes a long way :)

Yup, I remember when I used to could pass out FS weapons and they were
thrilled. Now Velium is a minimum :( (if you aren't giving them something
that good likely they have better already.
