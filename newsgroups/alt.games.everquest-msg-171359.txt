kite in CS wyvern if your dragon faction is up. that is where i learned to
kite. i tried kitties in ice clad but i got to many adds. hook yourself up
with a good guild they can provide you with groups and maybe even take pitty
on your lack of armor and do a elysian day. i am 58 and still wear the
elysian cuz it looks cool (cept for the hat) and has nice resists. you can
farm spiderling silks in feerot and sell em for 5p each to make some money.
good luck dear. =^..^=
