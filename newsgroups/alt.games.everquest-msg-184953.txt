If I hear anybody else in game bitching about the druid epic being
"hard" I'm going to hang them up by their toes in Neriak and cover them
with troll bait.

Mother of fucking pearl! Try the warrior epic some time! Or even worse,
mage or necro! You can do the god damned druid epic in a couple days
with a single group until Faydedar, and even in my old, decidedly
non-uber guild we killed him with three groups. 

You had to wait EIGHT whole HOURS for Dolgin to spawn?

Go talk to the monks about mobs spawning.
