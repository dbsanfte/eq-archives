I scored 98+ on all three... but was stymied because several times I 
only got 2 visible colours to choose from. Fortunately somewhere else in 
this thread someone linked a monitor calibration and I went through 
that... and indeed both my black point and my gamma were off (well gamma 
was at 2.4 which is apparently normal for older PCs [how old is older? 
its a 19" maybe 3 years old, when was this change made??] but the 
calibration said it should be at 2.2). I haven't re-tested but am sure 
the scores would improve.

Oddly, I *do* have an unusual 'color related' vision issue. I see the 
world in two different tints. With my left eye its a reddish tint and 
with my right its a greenish tint... most noticable when looking at 
something bright (like white sand beaches in bright sunlight for example 
-- where I first really noticed it. Not surprisingly with both eyes open 
I don't notice the effect at all.

I asked my eye doctor about it once and he'd said he'd never heard of it 
  but since it didn't appear to be impairing my vision not to worry 
about it.

I'd be interested if anyone else has heard of it/ knows what causes it.
