Still trying to pass that well-bruised theory off as fact, eh?

Let's assume it *was* true at some point in the past.  The fact that Sony
doesn't enforce their "copyright" by serving the mass-sellers (Yantis, et
al.) with lawsuits is an implicit surrender and/or devaluation of any claim
of "copyright" (applied in your bizarro little way) they may have in the
future.

Now, why don't they serve those guys with lawsuits?  I'd guess A) too much
trouble, not enough return, it keeps accounts being paid for, combined with
B) they aren't actually sure they'd win, and it'd *really* suck to lose.

But as long as *you* are sure...  :P   Sony's "copyright" argument was a
bluff and Yantis and others called them on it, while you bought it hook,
line and sinker.
