    Depends on the server. On my server, my guild is filled with part-time
players. How part-time? We have 150 mains in the guild, and get 50 people to
the average raid.

    However, we are the exception and even with the part-time allowed,
everyone in the guild is level 60 with some AA points. So you have to show
some dedication to playing to get in. If you want in a guild, the best way
is just to give up the alts and spend all your time working on the ranger.
If you're a nice person, you'll find a home after that.

    On most servers, you are likely right. Any guild that wants these things
will exclude people that aren't "intense" enough. But it's not like that
everywhere. All a guild really needs is a core of 24-7 players, a large
number of part-time players, and the ability to muster the majority of those
part-time players for really big targets (relative to what the guild has
been doing). Works for us. ;-)
