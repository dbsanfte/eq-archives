Umm - you are aware the rest of us aren't NPC's aren't you? We may actually
be playing for our own enjoyment and relaxation, with our own aims, goals
and views? This is not a shop you are gracing with your patronage and we are
not the shop assistants. Mmmmkay? You may be the centre of your world but
you don't even blip on our radars and there is absolutely nothing wrong with
that. Hard fact to accept for some seemingly....

And as for arrogant, nah - Lokari isn't arrogant. I think you need a new
dictionary. You don't understand what arrogant is, and you would be advised
to trust me on that one too because I am the most arrogant person you will
ever come accross.

Lokari hasn't even made it to my killfile yet - and if there is one thing
arrogant people cannot stomache above all else and that is each other ; )
