You do NOT need to spend your training points at every level. Relax on 
that. You can go ahead and practice them on your own. I would make sure 
that you have spent a point in Meditation though- it used to not start 
going  up until you did so.

Tradeskills are entirely optional. I recommend waiting on them until you 
know what you are doing more, and have more money to spend. Feel free to 
browse http://eqtrader.com and see what is out there.
