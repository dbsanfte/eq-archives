Recently I made a Barbarian Shaman alt/Twink and have been power levelling
the character. At 20th I choose, or try to, the surname of JaaMurskata,
which (poorly) translates from Finnish to Icesmash (I wanted Ice Hammer but
translator didn't seem to think there was a word for Hammer in Finnish) but
it's rejected!? Why? JaaMurskata doesn't seem to have any thing offensive in
it...Does it? Did I miss something there
I give up on Finnish in the End and take Isedatter (which is Ice Daughter in
Norwegian, got this checked members of a Familjen who recon it looks about
right) and it takes that surname fine.
Do they actually have a check on surnames? If so, how did the likes of
Gaybasher and Bukkake get thru?

Made 25 levels in 30hrs in play....took more like 30days of play to do that
with my main :ï¿½)
