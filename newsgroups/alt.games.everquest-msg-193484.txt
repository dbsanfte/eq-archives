It really depends on what aspect you have taken on the game. If one is
just interested in levelling and killing then the FV server would not
be the way to go. But if someone wants to actually take on a role and
an alternate identity then the difficulties are part of the pleasure
of the game, and not a hindrance, other than being a hindrance in your
chosen role.
