Do the Steaon's Deliveries quest..
Staeon is the Barbarian tailor vendor in one of the shops just by arrival
point from Nexus.
He wants some tailor supplies delivered to his friend Gearo (a Gnome) in the
Bazaar. And Gearo wants,
After haven gotten the tailoring stuff, trusts you to bring some gems back
to Staeton.

Both quests give following faction:

+ House of Fordel Shadow Haven
+ House of Midst Shadow Haven
+ House of Stout Shadow Haven
+ Traders of the Haven Shadow Haven

Made my HE and HFL chars amiable to most people in ShadowHaven, so it should
work well for Erudites too..
