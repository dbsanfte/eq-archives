Two hp per tic is better than no hp per tic, so the question is would I
rather have... grr, durations not listed.  Say its an hour.  Would I
rather have 250 hp higher cap and 1200hp worth of hp regen or 485 hp
higher cap and no hp regen?

Grouped, the higher cap.  Solo, the regen.

I don't see anywhere that tells me what level you have to be for this to
stick to you.

Is there a general rule, that you need to be within X levels of the
spell level?  Or that, say, for level 61+ spells you have to be level 47+?
