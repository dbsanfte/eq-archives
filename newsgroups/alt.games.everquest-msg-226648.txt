Everquest Online Adventures is the PS2 game, recently updated by Frontiers,
which is a stand-alone updated edition with new zones, player classes, etc.
but compatible with your old accouny and characters.

Frontiers would likely be the game to buy if you wanted to get the most out
of the game, but the original edition is still fine for the new player. EQ2
won't be out on the PS2 for a long time, I'd imagine.
