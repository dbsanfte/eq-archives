Do what you want. No use talking about it, once you get too big and draw
attention you will start getting flak. Flak is bad, it's where all your
dreams of making a fortune for doing fug all turn into a cesspool of
lawyers. Once lawyers become involved, rest assured they will be the only
ones making money from that point onwards.

The biggest problem about Auction sites is the rip offs. How are you going
to legally enforce honest trading on a black market? You rely solely on the
"honesty" and "integrity" of people that are willing to ignore a previously
legal binding contract. In other words, you gamble every time you buy an EQ
item or account, and the odds aren't that good either.

This is coming from someone who has brought an account to - I was fully
expecting to be burned and in a way, I still am. In my situation the amount
of money was negligable and I had enough brains to know if I got burnt there
was no-one to blame but myself.

There are quite a lot of people without an IQ over 3 who haven't figured
that basic fact out yet though. Expect to be dealing with immature morons
who will be blaming <you> after losing a grand on a bad deal and expect
legal crap. Lots of it.. Who wins and who loses then? Well - the lawyers win
and everyone else loses ~ including you.

Laywers will be glad to take your money for anything, but in the end
whatever case you have will be the equivalent defending/prosecuting someone
for stealing a stolen VCR.... Not the steadiest leg to be standing on for
any party concerned.
