I don't really dispute this.  But many people get it into their heads that 
this means when you actually give items to an NPC for a quest, the NPC 
checks to see what level you are before deciding whether or not to reward 
you.  As far as I can tell, there's no such mechanism for any quest, 
anywhere.  But people still run around saying "I have all the parts, but I 
can't do the suchandsuch quest until I'm level 7, I heard."  It just makes 
me want to scream.  Of course, the classic is someone who wants to _start_ 
working on their epic early getting shouted down by half the zone about 
how the "NPCs won't talk to you until you're X level" with X varying from 
40 to 54.  This is more horsepucky, as far as I can tell.  I can hold a 
decent conversation with many of the epic quest NPCs, even ones not for my 
class.  I can even turn stuff in and get the rewards...

So go ahead, guys, get the easy steps out of the way now, while you're 
still low level and might get experience for it...
