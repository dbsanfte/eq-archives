I never thought of that....

That puts a new twist into being "KoS" and faction issues. I not sure
how much fun it will be to have an NPC actively hunting you down while
you play the game. Kind of hard to "group" and interact with other
players if you have to "zone" and run from NPCs that "home in" on you.

If/When the big "D" does kill you, do you lose your Jedi "flag"? If so
then that would REALLY suck.
