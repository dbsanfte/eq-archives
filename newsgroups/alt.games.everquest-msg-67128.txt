He wasn't being a jackass. 'When did you stop beating your wife?' has long 
been the standard example of a leading question. I believe Jekke was trying 
to point out that you were asking a leading question since the warrior epic 
quest was never broken in the first place.

I'm not a warrior so I'm not really up on all this, but I believe the 
common allegations of the quest being broken were because of the 
possibility of losing your items when you received a quest reward 
(scabbard) which is a container, or too big to fit in a bag or something. 
If you had no general inventory slot free it would poof. Now that didn't 
mean the quest was broken, since you could complete it, just that if you 
didn't have the foresight to leave a spot open for the reward you could 
screw it up. I would imagine this doesn't happen now since items you've no 
room for end up on your cursor (unless you really try to break it, by 
handing in your items, then picking up something else onto your cursor 
before hitting trade or something).
