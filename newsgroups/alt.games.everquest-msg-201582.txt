Good, though I don't think it's going to help the perpetually LFG classes 
find groups.  It's just going to make soloing less appealing.

54 Druid LFG!
Screw that, let's get a rogue and fly through the xp!

Good!  Now I don't have to bug guildies because I'm too lazy to wait for 
my 2nd computer to log on!

Level 55?!  What business does a level 55 have being in any of those 
zones?!  Please, make it 58 or 59 if not 60.  Really, what's the point of 
opening up the planes?  So that people who have reached 61+ now have 
someone to make significant XP instead of being forced into grinding AA 
in tier 1.

Now I suppose this makes it easier to play with friends in tier 2, but I 
can just envision the mess that these zones are going to be for weeks 
after this as groups of mid-50s try to set up camps here.  Having been to 
PoS and PoV, I know why I couldn't get groups at 59 and why I hardly ever 
get 'em at 60: I'm too low to really be useful.

Flame on.

This seems like an okay thing.  I probably would have said 63.

Make it an AA point or something.  I highly doubt we'll see anything for 
the charm slot here, as that would mean less of a reason for any high 
level people to buy LoY.  Though I suppose I wouldn't mind having my +1 
to all thing like James mentioned, it seems a bit weak compared to the 
time most people put into getting flagged for PoV/PoS and haven't been 
able to continue beyond there for whatever reason.  Hell, I spent all of 
30 minutes getting my flag (group got 3 people flagged in the course of 
an hour that night), I suppose I should be happy with anything.

Good!  Well, looking stuff up on lucy wasn't exactly difficult.

Could be okay.  I've gotten used to my spellbook, this sounds like it may 
take some time to get used to.

Good!

I heard they send a line for each DoT you have stacked.  That's gonna 
suck.  I hope there's some kinda option to get a condensed version.  I 
suppose it'll let you know when a spell has done its last tick of damage 
though.

Okay, a guildie recently picked up air mephit blood, stonewood bow staff, 
earth arborean fibers, and a bunch of other crap all from one vendor all 
at once.  Now, while it's not obvious that the blood and fibers are for 
tradeskills, I would think "bow staff" screams "find a fletcher to make 
me into a bow!" already.

*shrug*  Will probably just flood the EQTC channel with anoob01 tells 
eqtc: 'what's a bat wing for?'
