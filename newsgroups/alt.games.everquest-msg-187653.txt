That's fine, because if you were the group leader that invited the
asshole back into the group, you'd be on my "never group with" list,
anyway.

The idiot in the second story wasn't acting as part of the group,
judging by the story. If you're acting like an asshole to me, then
don't expect any favors from me, groupmate or not. It's not like the
rogue couldn't get back to the group without the rez. His lost xp
isn't hurting the group one bit.

You want me to treat you fairly, then you sure as fuck had better
treat me fairly.
