True. But that is clearly completely irrelevant to the conversation at 
hand. Meanwhile the 'alarm' has a similiar function... that is it is 
also 'a countdown before exitting' (at least the exitting is the assumed 
purpose for the alarm... i suppose you could use it to remind yourself 
to refresh KEI if you tried hard enough.)
