The un-named child was Hurrietta Ironforge ( the Ironforge estate is in
North Qeynos where they operate as Gem dealers & Blacksmiths).
A fisherman in South Qeynos (Faren) found her bloodied dress under the docks
where the entrance to the aqueducts lies. (This fisherman is disliked &
continuously bothered by Trumpy Irontoe). It appears that the girl was
murdered at the request of the Fireprides ( a competing blacksmith in South
Qeynos), however whilst he admits to ordering the murder, he did so at the
request of someone else in the sewers called Garuc who he sends you to see.
Unfortunately I have never followed up on that side of the quest, so cannot
tell you the results.

It is interesting to hear of the "Green mist" that has been sighted  in the
Karanas recently. I hadn't given it much thought, but recently Riksis (my
Iksar monk) was reading up on his clans history. The Iksar calendar dates
from the time they were freed from servitude to the Shissir. The Iksar were
planning a revolt against the Shssir, but the Shssir were dissatisfied with
the power they had and "began making pacts with gods & demi-gods"
Someone/thing took a dislike to the Shssir because of this and "A green
cloud formed in the skies above Kunark. The cloud began to descend upon the
land, From its green core the face of death began to form". Although the
Iksar were unharmed by this cloud, the "skin and flesh of the snakes began
to rot from their bodies".

Is history about to repeat ??
