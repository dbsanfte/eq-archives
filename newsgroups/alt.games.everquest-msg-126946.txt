With the introduction of zone-wide communication, some "permanent" channels
evolved.

On my server (Antonious Bayle) there is a "/join taxi" channel for the
porting needs, and I can imagine others exist similar to that.

Are there anywhere I can find a list of these common channels ?

What channels do you use on your servers ?

I would love to have these:

LFG	
For people LFG. Very nice for pickup members in not so crowded zones.
  	/1 Level 30 enchanter LFG, currently in OT
	/1 Group level 28-34 LF melee in OT
	/1 Any druids around level 24 wanna duo with monk in Echo Caverns

Druid/Warrior/...	
Class specific Channels. For questions and hints
	/1 Where do I buy the level 34 Circle spells ?
	/1 Anyone got a spare Velishouls page 99 ?
	/1 I have outgrown this Necro item. Anyone wants it ?

Auction10, Auction100, Auction1000, Auction
Auction channels, max item price 10pp, 100pp, 1000pp, no limit. If you join
Auction10 and issue these, you wont get a Lammy offer..
	/1 WTB 1HS for woodelf warrior

Tailoring/Brewing/...
Trade skill channels. For hints and ingridients (Im not into tradeskills,
but think it would be nice to have IF I was)
	/1 When is wedding ring trivial ?
	/1 Where in Freeport can I buy gems ?

Guilds
A channel for guilds, sharing ideas for raids/events/roleplay ...
	/1 Any idea for a guildraid involving 2 groups around level 40
	/1 Is a "drunken dwarf run" contest really fun ?

And finaly: How do you promote the channels ?

If I get at tell from someone wanting a port, and I'm unable to help them
(busy, not close by, OOM, ....) I suggest that they try the taxi channel.
Most people aren't aware of it.
When I play my characters that cant port, I use taxi a lot (Mostly because
boats are boring and bugged)
