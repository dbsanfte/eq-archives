I'm talking about something that is an upgrade to the current engine, so to
speak. Sure Verant have added new content but to get the new GUI you needed
to buy Velious to get the Bazaar (in theory) you needed Luclin...as it goes,
it didn't work anyway.
I feel that improvements like that (or planned ones as the Bazaar code is
yet to go live on anything but test) should be free upgrades. I have no
problem in paying for zone expansions like RoK, SoV and SoL and have done 3
times each.

It seems the new interface IS going to be a free upgrade, or am I wrong and
it's going to be tacked onto PoP?

As for the zones mentioned, I can count on my hand the amount of times I
have hunted in Warrens or SB. Paineel, well I have passed thru there to get
to said zones. The Hole, been there once and the planes, never. With the
exception of the planes (which was brought in before I started playing, as
was Paineel) I can see why the others are free.
Surprised you didn't bring up Gems.
