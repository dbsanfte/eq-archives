Ok, I got a question.  WHY would the puller bring back a train to a
group, I realize that sometimes it's unintentional, but I've seen
people pull back 4 or 5 red mobs expecting the group to pull them out
of it despite the fact that it just ain't gonna happen.

When playing my warrior and pulling, if I get a crappy pull I will
make an attempt for the zone, or just stand there and suck it up and
die like the warrior I am.  Puller is a high risk job.  Comes with the
territory.

Or maybe that's just me.
