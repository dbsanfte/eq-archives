Nope, Skyshrine.  I forget the name, but one of the Sentries in the
kitchen in Skyshrine gives it out as a reward for running an errand to
Thurgadin (to pick up a shipment of velium from a dwarf in the mines)
and delivering the velium back to that Sentry.  Hail the NPCs in the
kitchen until one of them asks something like "do you wish to prove
yourself worthy to the kin?"  If your faction is high enough (I think I
did this at dubious, but it's been a while), he'll give you a note to
give the dwarf.
