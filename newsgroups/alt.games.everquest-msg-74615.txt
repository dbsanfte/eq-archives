well;

dont get a Sound Blaster PCI 128. especially not a model CT4700 of that
card. Creative Labs wont release drivers that take advantage of the card's
powers (such as 4 speaker, DirectSound 3D support, etc)

i would of suggested a CMedia 8738 sound card, as its cheap (around $15 for
something that compares to a Sound Blaster Live!) - it supports 4/6
speakers, and DirectSound 3D/EAX/A3D in all Windows OSes - but Verant mucked
up EQ's sound engine some time back, and now music doesnt work right with
that card (at least not with the latest WDM drivers)

so im guessing you look into a SB Live or Audigy. or some other card by
Yamaha, Turtle Beach, or whatever the heck..

and yes, a good sound card can make a lot of difference.

you might notice some new reverb, or different ambiant sounds.. or you'll
get 3D sounds (great with 4 or 6 speakers, especially with at least 2 behind
you so you can actually hear stuff behind you that is behind your character
on screen)
