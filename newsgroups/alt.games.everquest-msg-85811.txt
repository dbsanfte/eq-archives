Mulit-quest are necessary but what I would like to see to help cut down
pharming is if any dropped Item is Lore and the final quest Item is Lore
then you should not be able to loot the dropped item if you have the quest
item. Example you should not be able to loot the ring of the ancient if you
have JBoots. But I know this will never happen because Items can be used on
different quest. But it was just thought.
