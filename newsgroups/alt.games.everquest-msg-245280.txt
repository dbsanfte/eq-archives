I usually go through the progression of "Who wants to do an LDoN?"  Then 
grab 5 people, and do one.  I prefer to have some type of plate tank, not 
required though, one other healer (Paladin or another shaman will do), 
and some type of crowd control is handy, but far from required.  I do 
stick mostly to guild groups though.
