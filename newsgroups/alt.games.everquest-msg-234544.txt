I thought creating alt.* groups was a simple matter of sending a group
creation control message.  A rec.games.everquest.sullon-zek would require a
formal proposal, discussion period, and vote, but
alt.games.everquest.sullon-zek shouldn't.

It is true that if the news admins at Supernews and Giganews and Google and
major ISPs decided to not carry the group, it would not propogate very well,
and that is far more likely to happen for an alt.* group than a regular
group.  Is that what you mean by the powers-that-be stomped it?
