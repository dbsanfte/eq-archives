You need big ticket items in-game to circulate wealth. A guy goes out
and farms 1 million pp.. but with nothing to buy what does he do..
nothing. Wow.. 1 million pp and nothing to spend it on.. or even
worse.. 1 million pp and he can buy with 1k the best droppable armor
in the game. Now he has nothing he *NEEDS* and yet still has a big
stash.

With big-ticket items... he can buy... say an ornate bracer for 30K,
or a suit of ornate from 8-9 different people for 300K. Now that 300K
is spread over 8-9 people and in turn.. they use it for stuff they
need. It doesn't take long before the money and wealth start to get
spread across the player base.

If you ever wondered what they meant by trickle-down or supply-side
economics.. there is a good view of it.
