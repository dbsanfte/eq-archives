Nope. :-) Warrior was still there, still AFK, when I got back.

Oh well, turned out to be a good night after that.  Went back to CS, and
managed to have quite a while where I was the only one doing Wyverns, so got
to actually quad twice, and tri-kite twice.  I'm a Wizard, not a Druid, so I
start a multi-kite by pulling everything with Staff of Temperate Flux, and
then snaring *after* I get them all rounded up, so I'm running around, with
the mobs going full speed, dodging the Cobalt Drakes...that's a lot more fun
than Druids, who usually snare to pull.  (Although I'm finishing with enough
mana that I could actually start doing them Druid-style...have to consider
that).  Normally, I don't get to multikite there...I just grab singles, and
hope that I can get the spawn cycles spread out so that the quadders give
up. :-)

Biggest thrill was when I didn't notice my jboots had run out while I was
gather up a couple.  I was running along, clicking madly on my SoTF,
wondering why the hell I wasn't getting out of range, so turned around to
look, and was face-to-face with my pull.  I hope my neighbors weren't
disturbed by the loud "JESUS!" I screamed at 3:30AM. :-)

I also figured out that the Wyverns up in the tower that contains the zone
out to SS are really easy to pull with no risk.  A lot of people overlook
them, so they'll make it nice when the zone is more crowed.  (My technique?
Levitate, target a blue, get the mouse on a second blue, hit my SoTF, click
the mouse, hit my SoTF again, and run out the window.  Tomorrow, I think
I'll try to see if I can pull three or four at a time.  Maybe play with
pulling with an AoE spell.

Finally, to top off a perfect CS night...Yvolcarn was spawned at the very
tip of the Wyvern area, out past the SS zone tower, where there was no
chance of accidently getting too close to him while kiting and getting
chased away. :-)
