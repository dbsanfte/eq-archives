Someone in our guild is claiming that they were "ripped off" in the
bazaar the other day. They are saying that an individual was able to
buy items off of thier trader and not pay for them. I wont mention the
individual's name since I dont know the details surrounding this. I
was curious if anyone else has fallen victim to this bug/exploit or if
anyone has heard of any similar situations. I did a little research on
this and havent found anything yet, so im wondering if perhaps there
was a misunderstanding or something the trader did *shrugs*.
