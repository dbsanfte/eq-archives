Followup:  I tried logging on my friend's wizard for a port at the same
time, as my enchanter.  It slowed way way down, I felt like I was
running on a 286, then my system just froze.  I rebooted, and tried
again.  I was able to use it, but it was like trying to play while in a
vat of molases.  I've got a 1.4 GHz machine, 64 mb video card, and 256
mb ram, not too shabby, but need a better video card and some more
memory.  I haven't tried turning all the options way down or off, that
may take care of the problem, but I like my eye candy, so I'm reluctant
to do it :)
