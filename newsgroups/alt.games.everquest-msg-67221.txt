You CAN solo, but you'll do much better in a group.

One soloing technique is to charm one mob, use it to beat the crap out of
another mob, and then nuke the weakened winner of the fight. The problem
with this is that charm has a tendency to break just when you don't want it
too, and suddenly you have two mobs pounding on you.

I primarily soloed up until about level 22, with my trusty animation. Get
pet, buff it up.  Tash to pull, get hit, pet jumps in, back off, dot, nuke
to taste, med up, repeat.

Once you get breeze, and especially after you get clarity, you won't have
trouble finding groups - they will find you.  But don't get lured into the
trap of thinking that your job is limited to clarity.  Your job is crowd
control, clarity is a perk.  A really nice perk, but still just a perk.
