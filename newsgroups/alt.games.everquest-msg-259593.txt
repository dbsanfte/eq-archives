Also, check the results page for a link that asks you if you've been 
"Tweaked". Tweaking in this context means calibrating your computer 
appropriately for broadband, and there are a couple of relevant registry 
settings that affect this: MaxMTU and RWIN. These two values have to do with 
the handling and fragmenting of IP packets your computer is sending and 
receiving, and can have a significant impact on speed. I had to adjust both 
values on my machine and after doing so, I saw dramatic improvements in my 
throughput.
