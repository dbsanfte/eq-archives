PST but nm. Can't please all of the people all of the time, It's done in the
early hours PST to be less of an inconvenience to the majority.
The least busiest time is actually 11am - 1pm GMT but if they started then
it would not be playable for most of the night for Europe.

BST? Anyway to quote "All servers are down as of 3 AM PST for a scheduled
patch. The estimated downtime is 10 hours."
Patch started at 11am GMT and by their *Estimations* would be complete by
9pm GMT This was an estimation and they over run (as they sometimes do) by
an hour or so.

OK, this was said to me when I voiced a complait like this here. Did you
actually suffer?..Putting the word Suffer in perspective, by how much did
you suffer?

OK Now I have really bad news for you , you may want to cancel your account
now.
The 8 - 10hr patches are meant to be Bi-Weekly BUT sometimes and that isn't
to say it's a rare occurence, they are weekly.

No I don't like the servers being down either, I do like the fact that they
actually fix some things in game (although many I consider a long time
coming, better late than never) We joke about how we never trust the servers
for at least a whole day after a patch and I curse when I have a day off and
think "Hey I'll play EQ for a few hours (read, most of day)" only to find
that I should have checked the Patch Schedule before making such plans.
You'll learn to accept it, or you'll play something else.

CF
I can work out the refund you are owed (ignoring the Terms and Conditions
you agreed to) pro rata for all the time the servers have been down.
