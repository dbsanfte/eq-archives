    Not as easy as it sounds. How do you handle raids with lots of people in
them that did an event, but the raid leader/initiator of the event has not?
What about people that camp/LD before the event is completed? If the people
involved don't bother forming a raid, how do you determine who gets a
lockout timer and who does not? How do you handle substitutions while the
event is running? These problems can be solved if you have to enter an
instanced zone to participate, but for mobs out in the open like AoW, it's
not so easy. I do agree with one thing that follows from what you've said:
they should eliminate all blowable spawns and make them like the Cursed
cycle.
