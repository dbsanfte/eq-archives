If that's the case, then my character's name (as well as my 2 friends'
names) should not have been changed. Mine was 'Lucafur', and my friends were
'Saeten' and 'Diablow'. While my friends were online, but I wasn't, a GM
changed their names without warning to 'Aetens' and 'Iablowd'. They had to
petition to have their names changed to something else. I played for a while
still as Lucafur, but eventually petitioned for a new name just so I
wouldn't suddenly become 'Ucafurl' one day.

So, apparently at least one GM wasn't paying attention when told that
misspellings are fine...?
