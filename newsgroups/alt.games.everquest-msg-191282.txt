Desecration of those hallowed shrines of sacrifice is inexcusable.

The only thing I can say in the defense of the Friggin Frogs is that
this was done by two cowards in the dark of the night. It probably
does not reflect the sentiments of the bulk of the French public. At
least I would hope it does not.

In any event, I could care less if it does or does not reflect what
the majority of the French feel. I don;t like France. I found it to be
one of the dirtiest of the European countries. I also found the people
to be arrogant (in Paris at least) and obnoxious.

They have made their bed in the world comjunity. Now they can sleep in
it. I kinda wish the Germans would invade them again. They were VERY
quiet in the 1940's!
