500 g	beef sausages
1	small can tomato paste
1/2	can of Minute Maid Frozen Orange Concentrate
1	small tomato paste can of water
	Spices as preferred (I've tried s&p, basil, and nutmeg so far)

Casserole dish just large enough to hold the sausages.

Oven preheated to 300 F.

Mix paste, concentrate, water, spices.

Pour a small amount into casserole dish (just to cover the bottom).
Put in the sausages.  Pour the rest of the mixture over them.  Squidge
'em around to make sure they're covered.  Into the oven they go, for 1
hour.

When done, you may need to skim off a bit of fat (depends on the
sausages).

Serve with rice, pasta, or whatever.  The sauce works well with pasta
(macaroni, penne, spaghettini), I didn't like it as much with the
rice.


Variation - dice the sausages and boil 'em for about 5 minutes first.
This will remove some of the fat and give them more surface area to
absorb the sauce.

Variation - use pork sausages.

Variation - shredded cheddar on top just before serving.

Variation (untested) - replace sausages with lean ground beef.
Precook macaroni, then add a short while (probably 10 minutes or so)
before finish.
