I don't use the fear part of your ghetto mez, root and atone works
if you can get the mobs far enough from the group first (or better,
peel em off as they are coming in.  I find fear tends to take em
out of range of the root before it goes off.  Also, enstill would
be the worst root to use, as it takes longest to go off, and if you
are atoning it doesn't much matter how long it will last.  Root
is cheapest and reasonably fast, although I've been toying with
Immobilize as an even faster alternative.

I do use enstil and atone (or even just enstil) to park, though,
as quite often its the root I have memmed.  It lasts longer and
the longer cast time isn't all that debilitating, and its generally
more versatile.

Monk pullers are generally ideal, yes.  I can't say that I'm
normally in an ideal group, though, and I've had a lot of
fun because of that; learning to make do with quite random
combinations of skills in order to come up with new tactics
is something I quite enjoy.  Further, "Cleric Puller" "Melee
Cleric" "Nuker Cleric" "Solo Cleric" and so forth are just
so much of a lark to terrorize my guildmates with.  First I
tell em I'm doing it, then I demonstrate that contary to the
common wisdom, doing it makes sense under certain
circumstances.

Non-flame discussion on usenet.. there's another unlikely but
feasible combination of words in a single phrase I can
add to my cleric's lexicon
