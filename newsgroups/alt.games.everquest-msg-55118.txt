Sorry, but this will not actually stand up to closer scrutiny.  While
you may feel that treating live players as NPCs fosters role-play I
strongly disagree.  Want to know *exactly* what I am wearing?  Ask. 
That is a role-play opportunity.  As stated elsewhere, in a magical
world two things of vastly differing power can easily look exactly the
same.  No graphical limitations involved, they look the same because
they look the same.  Now looking at them tells you nothing, but asking
the person wearing it reveals what it is, if they choose to do so.  That
is a role-play opportunity, dialogue of any sort is.  Clicking on the
player reduces them to NPC status in your world, a prop to be used and
nothing more.  This tired analogy of glancing at appearances rather than
looking at tags really needs to be retired, it is not apt.  Since the
inspection window tells you the name of the item it really is much  more
akin to looking at tags than glancing at appearances.  Now if the window
showed you a picture of the item but didn't' show what it was you might
be on to something.
