PoStorm is one groupable.  PoJustice is one groupable.  Hedge maze
could be done one grouped but tricky.  BOT Tower key and upper area
key are one groupable.  Dragon in PoV will need 2 groups for sure, one
to deal with AD and another to kite the mobs that guards AD.

PoI, TT (PoN), and beyond would be hard to one group and suggest a
small raid force.  The final tier before EP planes are defiantly not
one groupable.  My guild survived Bertox with only 16 peeps in raid
force.  Yes we are die hard guild that tries the difficult raids but
usually survives.

If you are on Maelin, are available after 2 am EST or 11 pm PST (prime
time for Aussies), and do like PoP raiding you want to consider
Warriors of Eternal Nights.  To discourage guild hopping we do require
new members to have VT key as requirement to join us in upper PoP
raiding.  Just a few more hits and we'd be able to get into all 4 EP.
