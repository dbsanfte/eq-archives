    You didn't read this right. ;-)

    No, I'm telling you that spamming fast heals that are a little over 10%
larger than before will not save any more tanks than spamming pre-bonus fast
heals. The increase is too small to have value. In XP groups, this
slightly-bigger-than 10% bonus will still not allow a druid to be a good
healer - the efficiency on Nature's Touch is still cruddy compared with the
heals an XP group cleric uses (CH and CE). And in terms of saving a caster,
a 10% bonus won't cut it - clerics have already come to that conclusion. If
they wanted to save casters, they'd be better off getting healing crits
since when a crit goes off it DOES save someone.

    In short, I'm telling you this "healing improvement" for druids is
nothing but a treat to shut them up. They still won't heal well enough in
the sorts of XP situations they want to be in, and they still won't have a
unique role on a raid involving healing. All they'll have is a warm, fuzzy
feeling that Verant did something about their legitimate concerns.

    The first one. After that, the rotation keeps them alive. ;-)
