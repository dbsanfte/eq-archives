Unless of course that halfling is a druid and was about to evac you and your

Many halflings are Druids (or many Druids are halflings) remember that next
time to you watch, laughing, that 9th level halfling  get run down by a
plains cat, he might be the only druid around when you need a port
somewhere, and may just remember that event.
