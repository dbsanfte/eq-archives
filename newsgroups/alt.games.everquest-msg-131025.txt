"noncombatant" does not mean "non-military vessel"

"Noncombatant" means "not involved in this war".

Huh?  The point about Pearl Harbour was that Japan attacked
without warning, and without declaration of war, a nation that
had made no attack against it.

Certainly, a dangerous place for a US ship to be - but this seems
to have brought us back around to the point at which this
digression began.

Since we are all agreed that sinking that ship was an act of
war by Israel on the US - what was it that prevented the
US from going to war over it at that point?
