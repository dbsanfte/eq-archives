Since it's happened in another thread already, I'll add to the "Great
Usenet Apology" of 2002.

Ignoring the freedom of speech the internet affords us, I sincerely
apologize to anyone I may have offended for my posts.  It was wrong,
racist, innappropriate, uncalled for, and immature.

It was said to be funny, which some obviously thought it wasn't.

For what it's worth (and I know the obligatory "It's not worth
anything" posts are coming), but FWIW, I honestly am not xenophobic in
the least.  True, I loathe those cowards who viciously murdered
hundreds of my brothers and sisters; but I honestly don't feel that
way towards all.

Again, please accept my heartfelt apology for any insult or offence
anyone may have taken from my comments.

Take the apology, or leave it.  I just want to get back to EverQuest.

Now, back to more on-topic stuff...  Where's a good place for a 35
warrior to hunt, other than Overthere?  :-)
