I too am a casual player, a bit more time in a week than you, but still
casual. My
opinion is that Ruins of Kunark is a worth-while expansion for us casual
gamers.
I bought both expansions and have enjoyed the last 7 or 8 levels in ill
omen, one
of the most popular Kunark zones. I also created an Iksar and checked out
some
of the other zones around Kunark and cannot wait until I can get my
non-Iksar
characters to these zones. The zones in Kunark will not replace the zones in
the
standard game, but they are a different type of zone. More risk just
traveling to or
through them, but good hunting when you are there. They seem to be more
group
oriented, but seem to also have good solo areas. And the size of the zones
is huge
compared to the rest of EQ. Ill omen has a lake in it that is the size of
the Qeynos
Hills zone, and still has enough land around it to hunt without seeing the
lake. It
typically has 100+ people in it and rarely will you see more that 15 or 20
the whole
time you are there.
