I kinda had to rush this one out.  When they fixed the faction messages,
they broke them again - faction messages written to the log have a CR
character at the end of the name.

Yes, I bugged it, and I urge each and every one of you to bug it, too.

Since text file lines are terminated with a CR/LF, this usually doesn't
cause any problems other than faction names in the report have one of those
little block control characters at the end.

BUT.  If you edit the log for some reason, some text editors will
"helpfully" translate the CR to a CR/LF pair, splitting one line into two, 
and that will cause an error and the message to not be processed.

The program will now understand either case.

Changes:

Added "Level Date" and "Times" to Level Stats report, showing the first 
  time, and how many times (if more than one), you made that level.

Moved DPS from the various damage output reports, and changed the way
  it's calculated.  It's now on the new DPS report on the Histogram 
  popup menu, and is now calculated for each weapon delay.  Just find
  your HASTED delay and read the DPS.

Now tracks the "YOU are INVULNERABLE!" from Divine Aura. Thanks, Celaeno.

Added the ability to select which reports you want to run, on a per-
  character basis.  See the "View/Character Options" menu.  Note: the data
  to run all the reports will still be collected and saved in the data file,
  even though the reports themselves may no longer be run.

Changed "Options" menu setting to read "Program Options" instead.

"Stuns" added to Damage Taken and Mob Damage Output reports, to show how
  often you got stunned, and how often mobs stunned you.

Added new "Mobs by Zone" report, listing the mobs you encountered, the
  zone you encountered them in, how many times they were killed, gate 
  attempts, flurries, enrages, etc.

Faction messages with a CR in the middle are now processed correctly.

Understands new non-melee damage message.

All zone name references to "Kael Drakkal" replaced with "Kael Drakkel".

All zone name references to "Westwastes" replaced with "Western Wastes".

Mistakes are just small steps on the way to total failure.
