Not a flame at all - just curious but I wonder how much reading you did
doing primary schools - novels and such? I could not imagine even thinking
without punctuation - I write exactly how I think too. I could not cite a
single rule of punctuation or even tell you exactly what things like verbs
and adjectives are.... hang on - I think "Verbs are doing words" but thats
it. I totally ignored all attempts at english tuition but read voraciously
during my school days.

I suspect reading is the key - if you read a bit then you automatically
think in usable (maybe not correct) puntuation, so writing it down comes
naturally.

My biggest problem with writing comes from repeating words or looping parts
of sentences. As I write if I correct myself mentally, or pause on some
wording then that thought process manifests itself literally in the
writing....and proberly even more detrimentally in my speech too.
