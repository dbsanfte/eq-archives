}AFAIK this would not help a summoned pet since the summoned pets use 
}their own DMG/DLY and not the weapon's.

They use their own delay, they use the greater of their damage or the 
weapon's damage.  You probably have not seen many people turn over weapons 
with a higher damage than the pet, since they tend to be worth a fair 
amount.

The rules may also be different for dire-charmed pets, I dunno about that 
one.  But I suspect we have a witness here who could inform us.
