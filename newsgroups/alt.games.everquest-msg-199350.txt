Well you see, camping doesn't always involve an epic mob, a raid etc.  Just
the act of exping at <a spot> is commonly called "camping" said spot.

Thanks!  It was really puzzling me just WTF gate did.

LOL.  CLASSIC.  That is THE most retarded comment I have EVER seen a shaman
say. EVER.
Canni = mana.  Understand?

Dunno about your groups, but in my groups when <ANYBODY> but the tank is
being hit, its a waste of mana.   Lets see, CHEAL on the tank if he takes
all the damage, or quick heal on you (mana intensive spell) and THEN a Cheal
on the tank.

> and the last thing I want to do is drain the healers mana regen'n my mana!

So use some of that mana you just regened, and cast a fucking heal on
yourself.  You still end up with more mana than when you started.

You know, if you didn't write such moronic posts, you would quite likely get
friendly and helpful tips on improving your abilities as a shaman/all round
player.

Canni-dancing is a way of maximising mana-regen.  You know, that stuff that
prevents downtime when you have plenty of it?

Or you could do like people are telling you, and use canni to regen your
mana (at a MUCH greater speed).

Tip for you... debuff mob,  slow mob, DoT mob, heal group if needed, wait a
short while, now by this point your tank should have solid agro (if you sit
and he doesn't turn to you, you can be sure agro is solid).  So now you
start to canni your mana.  There is no danger of the mob agroing you (unless
you are retarded and low HP agro), so canni down to 2 bubbs.  Cast a heal on
yourself.  You end up with more mana than had you just sat and medded, KEI
or not.

Why the fuck would you pull with your cleric at 1m.

Well im quite sure the monks you grouped with were morons.  After all,
stupid fucking retards tend to attract other fucktards.  I bet you
complimented each others play style just great!
