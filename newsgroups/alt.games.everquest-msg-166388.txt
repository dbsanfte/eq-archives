I had a similar type of problem - if I try to play EQ with my contacts in,
they start to dry out and I start getting headachy.  I finally figured out
why, at least in my case.

When you're working on a computer (programming, typing, whatever), your eyes
tend to move a lot more than they do when you're playing EQ.  Well, at least
they do for me.  Whether it's typing for work (following the words across the
screen, looking at source material, etc.), surfing the 'Net (reading, mouse
movement for the hotlinks, etc.), I rarely if ever have a problem with my
contact lenses while working on the computer.  I find when I'm playing EQ that
I'm staring at the center of the screen almost exclusively - I know what my
hotkeys are, so I don't need to look over at my spellbook, and the health/mana
bars can be noted with barely a flick of a glance.  The text box scrolls in
the same place on the screen, so even reading that doesn't require a lot of
eye movement.

If you try playing again, and you have to (for example) regenerate mana,
instead of watching the screen while you meditate, try looking at something
else - maybe a book or something - to give your eyes some different movement
and stimuli, and be sure that you're blinking normally and not doing the "1000
Yard Stare".

Dunno if it'll help, but it might be worth a shot!
