Yes, I too had a corpse that could not be resed, even though it should
have had at least 10 minutes left.  That "10 minutes" left is even
with worst-case assumptions, such as the res timer running while
offline at the 1/7th rate that the corpse decay timer runs.

I too use "/camp desktop".

Others have seen this, too.
