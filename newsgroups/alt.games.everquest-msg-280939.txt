Actually, if you do the new tutorial, then you may end up staying as 
long as level 10, and when you finally do bother to leave, you don't end 
up in your starting city, you end up in POK, with another task dropped 
in your lap, which leads you to exploring the basics of POK and finding 
a couple guys who give you still more tasks.  Work on their tasks can 
keep you busy till 25 or so, although during some of that time you're 
going to have to find other things to do as you need to level up more to 
get those tasks done (assuming you aren't twinked/powerbuffed that is)

Hopefully by the time you've finished all the tasks you're able to find 
things to do for yourself, although frankly I do miss having a list of 
nice quests to run... I found the whole task system to be an excellent 
way to add some fun to what can, to be honest, turn into a grind.

But it does nothing at all to acquaint you with your home city, except 
inasmuch as you have to take your task rewards for one of the two guys, 
to your home city guild master.
