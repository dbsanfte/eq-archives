Well,the usual thing,over the years one makes a lot of friends
who make one stay in the game.
And I didnt say I do not play EQ anymore,but I didnt buy TSS
for the above mentioned reason,hopefully I can convince some 
EQ friends in summer when my account runs out to follow me
to UO(yes,I know it has issues also,cheating,scripting,pking,
but at least it doesnt crash all the time or forces player to buy
another buggy and dull  expansion every half year).
