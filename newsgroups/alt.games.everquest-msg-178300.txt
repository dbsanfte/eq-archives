    I've never payed more than 10pp for it, but yeah im under 50... almost
49 and also an SK which might throw people off. But should anyone should be
paid more than 60pp for clicking a button?

    I understand a donation is appropriate, but if 10pp ever gets knocked
back you can bet /ooc will hear about it ;)
