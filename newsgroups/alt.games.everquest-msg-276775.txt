You're right. I'm sorry. I was forgetting that at one point I had asked 
about finding further sources of info and was thinking somebody who knew 
about it or had made a purchase would be able to provide specific info from 
their experience. But maybe that was the guy's intent and I was jumping the 
gun, so to the person who provided the above quoted answer, please accept my 
apology for jumping to conclusions when in fact you were nice enough to 
explain a good deal about this for me and anyone else interested.

I love your Ben Franklin quote by the way. That is the best one I think I've 
seen in quite some time. :-)
