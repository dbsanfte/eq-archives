Excellent misinterpretation of the law.  To be correct, you would have to
say "the courts CAN NOT consider any facet of religious proscriptions, but
MUST consider the person's personal beliefs and convictions and *rights*,
without regard to whether they are religious or not."

West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943)

"While religion supplies appellees' motive for enduring the discomforts of
making the issue in this case, many citizens who do not share these
religious views hold such a compulsory rite to infringe constitutional
liberty of the individual."

And misunderstood whose religious beliefs were being infringed upon to boot,
as the *woman* is the devout catholic.  Who cares what the husband is.

And as I pointed out in my other post on this subject, the woman is not, and
has never been claimed to be, brain dead.

Sadly, some people assumed that since they told their parents their wishes,
and expected that their wishes would be evident due to their having certain
beliefs, they didn't have to.
