I know some people who received plat as Christmas gifts from relatives
searching for Everquest related items to buy thier family and friends. I
also know some people that wanted a horse, and just did not want to go camp
HG's to get one and never seemed to be able to save, saying they bought 10k
for a horse.
People are buying pp etc, or they would not be selling it. Honestly it does
not effect my game play, so I could give a rat's ass about it, but then I
realize I am playing a game and seldom let other people's play style bother
me. (I am sure I will get flamed for this stance as "It does effect your
play style it has caused inflation" etc.)
On FV inflation is going to be very strange, since people really can only
have one character per account there should be more of everything around (or
less high end gear as high end people re-roll over and over), which is shown
in our bazaar prices and really does not make much difference for the influx
of money etc.
