How do you know it is boring?  You presume that while he waits for the rare
spawn, he's just staring at the screen.  Here are some things I've done
while waiting for a rare spawn:

1. Chat with my guild or friends.

2. Read.

3. Design programs.

4. Develop a proof that the procedure I use for placing two Flintstone
vitamins in each slot in my 7 day pill container would never lead to me
having to have two of the same flavor on the same day, unless it was
impossible to avoid because of a bad distribution when I pulled 14 from the
bottle while refilling the pill container.

5. Switch to the other computer and submit reports to Spamcop for spam I've
received.

6. Watch TV.  I've got an UltimateTV (kind of like a Tivo), busily grabbing
every Seinfeld, Simpsons, Futurama, Enterprise, Firefly, That 70's Show,
Curb Your Enthusiasm, Queer as Folk, and Frasier that comes by, so I've also
got something amusing to watch.  Plus, since it can pause and rewind live
TV, I can also watch educational stuff on, say, The History Channel, while
waiting for something to happen in EQ, and simply pause when EQ needs
attention, or rewind.

7. Play my guitar.  I'm slowly working my way through learning Pachelbel's
Canon in D Major.
