Since you have a Good CPU and Video card already, go for the RAM.

me and my friend have similar setups to each other. i have a Celeron 1GHz,
GeForce2MX. he has a Duron 1GHz, GeForce2MX.

however, i have 768 megs ram, and he has 512.

his load times and zoning are longer, and the system swaps in places like
Shadowhaven...

512megs is just too little
