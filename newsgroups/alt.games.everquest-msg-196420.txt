now on twisting can you make a hot key that would say do this:


/start song 1
/pause
/start song 2
/pause
/start song 3
/rinse /repeat

ok I know these are not "actual" commands but is would be nice to have a 
hot key that would only have to be pressed once...kinda like how a cast 
can stand, cast , sit all with one key.....

thanks
