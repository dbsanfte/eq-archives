Sony is operating under the assumption that people have no memory.  Let's
work an example.  Suppose you have 12 people, and you need to do something.
If you do it in the morning, it will annoy 4 of them.  If you do it in the
evening, it will annoy 8 of them.  Sony does it in the morning.

That's quite sensible of them.

Now, let's say you need to do it again a couple days later.  Sony's
assumption is that it is better to annoy those same 4 people again, rather
than annoy the other 8 people who got off easy the previous time.

Sony would rather have 4 really pissed off people and 8 happy people, than
have 12 pissed off people.

If the people in the other time zones don't like this, they need to stop
bitching about it and do something: they need to *cancel* their EQ accounts,
and tell Sony that it is because Sony treats them this way.  And not just
old timers who have put up with this for years, but also fairly new players
in those regions need to do this, too.  Otherwise, Sony's assumption that
each patch is independent as far as their bottom line goes (which is all
that matters to them) is correct.
