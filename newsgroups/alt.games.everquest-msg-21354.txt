when I "purchased" my account, I agreed to the EULA. so the contract took
place at the point of purchase. and the EULA applies to the account, not the
game, if I recall it correctly.

soo, I think it's accurate to say that the EULA is a binding contract.

Verant has never said (as far as I am aware) that you can't sell the game.
You can sell the game. but not the account. of course, without the account,
the game is worthless, since you can't reuse the key, but that isn't the
point
