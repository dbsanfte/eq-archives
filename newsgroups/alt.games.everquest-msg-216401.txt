Thats not the point, the point is that if the adventures are pathetically simple, then nothing you have to say about
them is interesting in a tactical way, you are essentially zerging your way thru them, your tactics could suck eggs
and who'd care, since you are crushing them so completely either way.

Thats not to say its an invalid topic of conversation, "LDoN dungeons not challenging" would be a good thread to
start.

But it -is- to say that any discussion of mana levels and the like aren't really relevant if the dungeons are as easy
as crushbone to a bunch of 30+ cahracters.

Yes, they do.  But they vary around a target.  Around 80, they may be as high as 90, as low as 70, and still
comfortable.  Around 30, they may be as high as 40 and as low as 20.

The point is that a general level of 30 is different from a general level of 80.  Since thats the difference the
discussion centers on, wriggling around and trying to evade this difference isn't going to help the discussion.  If
you can't accept a steady state of exactly 30, I'm willing to change the definition to 30 +/- 10, and 80 +/- 10.  Note
that by picking 80 instead of 90 my +10 still evades the inherant inefficiency of FM

Thats what Givens are for.  For the sake of the arguement, we simplify and eliminate the other variables.  If you
-must- keep the +/- 10 as a part of the base number, go ahead.  But it doesn't make any difference really, or if it
does it actually makes things even worse; now you are sometimes pulling at 20, which makes the odds of any "oops"
incedent exceding the mana pool go up dramatically.

The pull rate is identical in both cases.  You continue to think that this is about pull rate, but its not.  Its about
the point at which you pull; at pull rate X mana remains roughly steady thru the entire run; whether with a pool of
about 80 or of about 30.  If you are reccomending a pull rate greater than X, then you write yourself off as a joke
immediately; greater than X means running OOM without any need for bad luck or mistakes.  Likewise, running at less
than X means going up to FM and wasting time/resources.  Only an average rate of X works for any extended pull time.

You may pull sooner than I'd like (ie before reaching an 80M ready state), but you can't pull faster than I'd like,(ie
pulling such that after each pull my mana is 10% lower than it was before the previous pull) because you are limited
by your resources.

You had to take the exact same med break to maintain 30M.  So you aren't ahead.  If you don't maintain the 30M, then
20M, 10M, whereever it is that you do maintain.  Eventually you -must- slow pulls down or break for medding, unless
its impossible to pull fast enough to actually lose mana.  Posit for the arguement that you maintain roughly 30M, the
group maintaining roughly 80M does exactly the same thing; maybe running down to 70M, sometimes pulling light enough
to get all the way up to 90M, but its the very same rate.

Remember, these two groups act in exactly the same way at all points, except that they start the "pull rate of X" at
two different points, 30M and 80M.

The mana reserve was there not for the constant pulls, but for the disasters.  The group with 80M has a much better
chance of surviving disasters than the group with 30M.  If 40M was needed, the group with 30M wiped and the group with
80M didn't.

Again, you are fiddling around with petty details.  Your cleric either constantly loses mana, constantly gains mana,
or constantly circles around a steady mana rate.  I propose that in the long term, only the third option is a
possibility, constant mana loss means eventual OOM and wipe.  Constant mana gain really means frequent FM and wasted
mana; no efficient group can afford that.  Constantly circling around some target happens naturally.  What that target
is depends on the puller.  Your target seems to be 30, mine is 80.  If thats not true, say it is for the sake of this
arguement, which is simply what target is better.  If you think 80M is a better target than 30, thats fine, perhaps
before this point you didn't understand what the arguement was about.

There are certainly other topics we could argue about, but I'm interested, in this particular discussion, in just this
one thing.

Roughly 30.  Roughly 80.  You might say " I will pull at 30" means an average of 50... but since you've said you'll
pull at 20 I doubt that is the case.  I think 30 is a good argueing point for the discussion, rather than trying to
figure out exactly what your appoximate average mana level really is.

Covered already.  You are trying to evade the arguement, which I am admittedly simplifying.  Both groups pull at
exactly the same points every single time, except very early in the cycle, when group B waits for 80M.  Two clones are
running them who pull in exactly the same way.  The groups have the very same composition, get exactly the same luck
all the way thru the entire dungeon.  When group A pulls at 20, group B pulls at 70.  When group A pulls at 40, group
B pulls at 90.  When group A wipes at 0M, Group B dips below 50M.

At the end of the mission, group A and group B both med up to full, where group B saves all the time they lost at the
beginning of the mission.

Only if the mission is so easy that medding to full for the final fight does group A have any advantage at all, and
its only the few minutes involved in a single med cycle, as by definition in all other ways the two groups play
identically.

Its not "your group" versus "my group" its just group A versus group B.

During those "natural downtimes" group B runs its mana up just as far as group A does, unless those downtimes are so
long that more than 20% mana is gained... are you really suggesting that while moving there are down times long enough
for a 20% mana gain?  Who's pulling slowly now?

No I'm not.  But I've already said so above.  More or less the same.  Average same.  Worry about the question, not

The exact same way you are.  Exactly. By definition. What group A does, group B does.

Raids are entirely a different species of animal, not relevant to this discussion.  If a wizard turns out to be 80% of
your DPS in a group, then his mana is directly relevant.  But this is still not part of the discussion at hand.

Yes.  If we act identically, then you won't go faster.  You can't, because we are acting identically.  The only only
only difference is the point around which we keep our average mana.

It is if you can't stop going off on tangents and focus on the single difference between the two groups.   Unless you
can demonstrate that your method is faster solely because your average mana is lower, then you cannot win this
arguement.  Because the arguement is NOT about whether med pull med pull is better than pull pull med med, its not
about whether slow pulls to conserve mana are better than fast pulls with long meds, its not about whether clerics
wearing blue are better than clerics wearing green, its only only only about whether a rough target of 30M is better
than a rough target of 80M

Yes yes yes.  Thats it.  You are getting it here.

We keep the very same distance, 50M, at all times.  Except of course when your "blowout" is more than the mana in your
pool.  Then you die, and group B still has 50M to spend.

Your theory that the 80M cleric wastes more mana is also an attempt finally to address the issue.  However for the
sake of this arguement it is off the point; the two groups act identically in every way.

Just for the sake of this discussion, yes.  The two groups act the same in every regard, unless a wipe is at hand.

45M from 30M is 15M.  Group B got to 95M when you did that, acting just the same as you did getting to 45.  If you
didn't wait, we didn't, if you did, we did.  Cause thats what happens when both groups act exactly the same.

I don't assert that.  But if I did, IF I did, I still wouldn't fall behind, because you need (lets say) 100,000 mana
to get thru the adventure, and so do I.  As long as I never reach FM, it doesn't really matter if I med and then pull
fast and med and then pull fast, or if I pull a little more sedately and never really break to med.  100,000 mana
takes a certain amount of time, no two ways about it.

Now thats not true of all situations; for a nuker, for example, its better to med up, then burn, then med, then burn;
that way you can spend at twice your mana regen rate while mobs are in camp; if the mob dies twice as fast he only
costs you half the healing mana, and your healers aren't such a drag on the group.  But we aren't discussing that
angle, its the healer mana thats the topic at hand, and in particular the healer mana reserve.

Yes. This took us both to 30M

No.  Either you are now dead (because you kept pulling at the same rate as above, and went under 0M) or you slowed
pulls down to a "steady" rate, in which you are still around 30 and I'm still around 80.   So I don't stop pulling if
you dont stop pulling.  This is what you are missing, being at 30M doesnt' give your cleric any special bonus mana
regen rate that lets you continue to pull constantly and fast.

I can figure out how you would gain time IF you could magically get mana back that group B couldn't.  But since the
two groups are identical and playing the same way, that doesn't happen.  You ONLY gain at "the third pull", assuming
you pull the first three rooms so fast that you blow thru 70% of your mana pool.

And if at any point you need more than 30M, then you lose; either you lose by medding back up to "enough" before you
make that hard pull, or you lose by wiping out.  If both groups med up to FM for the final fight, then you lose
exactly everything you gained in the beginning.  If you do the final fight while lower on mana, then you do indeed
gain that first little bit of speed pulling.  But thats it, thats the best you can ever do, the amount of time it
takes to med up 50% mana, once the entire run of the adventure.  Thats what you stand potentially to gain, and you add
that much to your risk of wiping in order to gain that.

Worse, you actually propose entering the dungeon at 30M, in which case you don't even gain that much time against the
limit; you have to do the whole run with literally 70M worth of med time cut out.  If you never ever med up any higher
for any mob then you can break even, but if you even stop to med up to 40M before the boss mob thats 10M medding time
WORSE than group B.

My assumption that you might gain a very slight amount on the run is predicated on the fact that both groups enter FM.

I was playing the game when Kunark was released.  I have indeed killed mass quantities of easy blues.   And even
soloed on light blues.   Its just grinding though.  Been there done that, but never tried to crow about my leet
tactical skillz on doing so.  Its not worth worrying about, frankly.  I'll grant you that  there's not a hill of beans
difference between mowing thru barely blue mobs at 30M and at 80M.  But I still say that you only stand to gain a few
minutes, because its just one single med cycle worth of time.  If you waste it rushing into the dungeon before FM,
even sillier, but if there's no chance at all you'll run out of time, fine.

IF its that easy, though, why are you slumming at normal instead of using Difficult, or doing it with a 4 man group?
You are throwing away exp and loot on those other two guys, and if its trivial at 6 people its still doable at 4
people, assuming you actually have any skill at the game.  But I forgot, you "play to win" which means hitting the
ball from the ladies tee, playing TBall instead of trying to hit what the pitcher has for you, swimming in the kiddie
pool... If thats what you're talking about, I just can't be bothered to care -how- you go about doing it.
