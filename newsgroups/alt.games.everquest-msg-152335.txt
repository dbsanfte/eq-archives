1 Ability that would be nice is a Garneted method to disrupt any spell being
cast. Such as a Shoulder Block that pushes the mob back now there should be
a side effect to this like 5 sec where the Warrior is stunned and maybe a 7
minute delay before he can use again but it will always disrupt the Spell
weather the mob can be stunned or not. Also the new Meat Shield discipline
has promise where the Warrior takes 75% of the Damage of the group will make
them real popular with the Enchanters
