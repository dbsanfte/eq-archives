Play a ranger full time and come back and tell us that. None of this
"oh well I played a ranger a couple times now I'm an expert" baloney
either. I've had both warrior and ranger L65 mains at different times.
In the meantime, I'll just keep on trucking with my heal that heals
less than one hit from a regular PoP elemental mob, my nukes which are
resisted 4/5s of the time, to the point where in high PoP and later it
lowers my dps to use them, and all the rest of the vaunted "utilities"
you seem to think are so great.
