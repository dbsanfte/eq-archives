Yes, they fade with food.

About 4 minutes (out of 8 hours) fades for every piece of food that you eat.
Unless you buy Ambrosia, which is extremely expensive, to reduce 1 death
point at a time.

Not thier fault you chose to play it safe, rather than challenging yourself.

I, on the other hand, attempted to help defend Augundhell from one of the
undead invasions, and ended up with 4 death points in about an hour.

I guess theres no accounting for taste.   Myself, I enjoy the crafting there
more than any other game I've played.  Including UO and SWG, which were both
superior to EQ.
