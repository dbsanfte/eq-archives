Basicly it has made it where a single person can take what it used to 
take a group to do. I started eq a bit over a year ago and I have seen 
this spell slowly rise up to where people think they MUST have it for 
anything. Kei needs a slight mod to it, i see level 3's and 4's running 
around with it. Isn't that going a bit far?

The lower levels people learn how to play there toons, about mana 
conservering, about there spell lines, and about there skills... 
Suddenly boom! Unlimited mana for about the 1st 10 levels, guess when 
they learn mana conserveration.... NEVER. Soloing it's great but I 
personaly don't use it, however when I have someone port or gate out mid 
battle because there kei faded and they have it in there tiny little 
brains KEI is a MUST to even cast a spell that is going too far! Nercos 
and Shamen do not need kei due to them getting hp to mana convert, Also 
Chanters don't need it as much do to there C, and Wizards don't need it 
as much because they can harvest some mana every so often.

The thing is everyone seems has forgotten how to play there toons 
without that stupid spell. What happens if suddenly they nerf KEI where 
you have to be 46+ for it even to take hold on you? There is gonna be 
alot of you guys that will how no clue what so ever to do, or how to 
even play your toon!

DARE TO BE DIFFERENT! GO WITHOUT KEI!
