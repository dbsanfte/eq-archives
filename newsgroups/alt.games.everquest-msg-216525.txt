Spent 2 hours tonite popping from zone to zone via farstones /ooc'ing LFM,
scouring the lfg window, sending unsolicited tells to strangers gleaned
from "/who all 20 26 <classname>" to at last recruit 6 people. We head out
to dungeon in oasis, and it's bugged -- won't let us in. Time runs out,
we try for a mission in nro, hoping that a mission from another camp might
let us avoid another bugged dungeon. We zone into dungeon successfully,
kill enough mobs to find 29 Powerless Geomantic Doodads, and I get the
message:

[Fri Sep 26 00:00:18 2003] You have successfully completed your adventure.
You received 0 adventure points.  You have 30 minutes to exit this zone.

WTF? ZERO adventure points for 3.5 hours of work?? Bleah!

Next time I'll just camp aviaks at KFC....
