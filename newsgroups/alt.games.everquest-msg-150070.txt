Just grouped with a druid and suffered a partial group wipe.

We were decidedly in over our heads with a pull of several
"can't be mezed" golem things down in chardok.  Damage
was chunky and my CHeal was coming in late on the warrior.
Warrior died, then chanter, then druid.  Then I performed my
bozo nono for the day, went DA, memmed gate, gated out...
not thinking that the necro was FD in place and could rez me
to rez the others.  Mage also made same mistake, died instead
of staying to be rezed so she could COH me back in... at
least I had company.

Anyway, things might not have been managable at all, but the
druid had been asking some questions earlier about her role
in a group, so I thought it worth commenting that if MT hp
drops to the 20% mark she should throw in heals to try and
keep him alive till CHeal hits.

Oh, she knew that, of course, and was casting, just her spell
didn't hit till after he died, same as mine.

You see, she was in mid nuke when things went bad, and had
to wait till nuke went off to start her heal.  Then she tried to
turn to cast on chanter but had to wait for first heal to finish even
though warrior was dead.  Then she had to wait on that heal
before she could start evac, and died before getting it off.

All very natural and logical, her instincts as to what was important
were right on the mark (well, except that nuking thing, have to
wean her of that) but...

she was literally unaware that ducking cancels a spell instantly
in mid cast.

So as a public service, I'm bringing it up here.  Duck cancels
cast.  Duck again to allow yourself to start a new spell.  The
game defaults the d key itself to duck/unduck, so all you have
to do is tap d twice in rapid succession to get out of something
you wish you hadn't started.

Show of hands if you DIDN"T know that, I'm sure most did.
