Dunno if anybody cares, but I think I know at least one of the things
that drives former guildleaders to retake their old guilds.  An in-game
friend once spent several days ranting about how he had to let somebody
else make "his" new guild because he was not allowed to be the creator.
He told me that he had petitioned when he got the rejection email and
was told by a GM that you may only ever create one guild with a given
account (the guild he had earlier created fell victim to the first
guild purge, so he was trying to remake it).  Refusing to accept the
answer, he had logged onto his Guide account and contacted a GM he knew
(as a Guide) and was promptly told the same thing.  This is second-hand
info, and it's old as well (from shortly after the first guild purge,
pre-Velious iirc).  It does seem to explain, at least partly, the
motivation for players to behave like that.  And it also fits with
SOE's (creator = owner) > guildleader policy.
