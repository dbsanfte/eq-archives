What are cheap tactics though? Is an Ambush a cheap tactic? 
Is using overwhelming force? Is guerrilla warfare cheating?
If they are allowable in the game mechanics, if the game CSR's don't
have a problem with them, then how can they be cheating? 
Remember this is not UO. There is no recall. The guy who was your
friend 2 seconds ago cannot shoot you in the back and kill you and rob
you and then /em aZZrapeZ  you.  Can't be done. Not in Daoc. If your
in the combat zone be on guard ALL the time. Post scouts, define a
perimeter,  be ready with aforementioned plans and be ready to fight
or flee, have rendezvous points available if you have to scatter.  
The game of war has one Rule. Win at all costs. Use what you have to
make sure you do and they don't. That's not cheating and there is no
such thing as Cheap tactics within the boundaries of that Rule. 

If the entire discussion centers around cheating then that is a
separate topic. Cheaters exist in all games.  In DaoC they are banned
on first catch.  They even fired three CS reps who were twinking out
their chars using inside info. 

If the game discussion centers around some sort of inequity in some
game mechanic then that is a valid problem.  Mythic is working on
balancing the game now and i would guess for it's entire length. 
Problems will occur no doubt but will also be fixed. If they are not
fixed that's a valid reason to call something a cheap tactic. Or quit.
So far that hasn;t been the case though.
