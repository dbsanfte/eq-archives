Velk drops some killer boots for mages too (RL friend got them about a week
ago).

Same mage friend wears the strands off the worm, heh.

Really though, for my guild anyways, all of the worm's loot would find a
good home. =/
Flowing thought doesn't exactly suck.
Worst piece of loot that I see is the cudgel.

(just for reference my guild is mostly doing HoT armor and epics, we lost to
Doze last time we found him up, we killed Va'Dyn, not Vindi capable yet...
so people say anyways.  Though we don't have a large roster, so it's hard to
get a lot of people on without scheduling in advance)
