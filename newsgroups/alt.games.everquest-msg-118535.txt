Spend a couple of days farming greenies, buy/beg/borrow/steal some blue
diamonds, then find a high level smith of your race and a little luck.
Bingo, armor superior to kael/SS/thurg for a couple of kpp max.

If you worship Rallos Zek, regardless of race, camp Griffenes in NKa and
SGs in Ro/Oasis. Despite al the equipment I have, I'm getting 4-5 peices
which will ALL be decent upgrades to me.
