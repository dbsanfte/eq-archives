They link it. ;) To link an item you first have to open the item
properties window. Just press and hold down the "alt" key and click on
an item. A new window will open telling you which stats etc the item
has. Then type something and klick on the item picture to insert a link
into your text. That's all.
Btw, there should be a 'link all' button when you loot a corpse. Just
click it and you'll get links of all items on the corpse in your chat
window.
