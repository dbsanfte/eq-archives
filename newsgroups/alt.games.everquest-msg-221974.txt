Haven't been doing the stat buffs so far, but will look at it for
str.  So far I don't have proccing summon weapons unless we are
beating up summoned mobs, and I can't think of any we can take on
at our level (36-41).

Thats a good thought, so far she doesn't need mal-x to land slow
but I recall that changing with my shaman in his 40s, pretty much
had to malaise every single mob.  COurse I used to use it to pull
with, what would she pull with if not that... cancel magic?  My
mage is pulling with that now when he pulls, but either of us
could malaise pull instead if the resist debuff is in order.

I've found this part remarkably easy.  Shaman tells /pet no
taunt. Problem solved.  She was literally unaware such an option
existed... but then she's only been a pet class for a couple
levels, and her stint as a 65 druid didn't leave her with a lot
of pet skills either, as that druid pet is pretty much only good
for laughs; my cleric pet could take it two falls out of three.

Since shaman pets don't have any spells and tend to do less
damage than comperable level mage pets (not much less by my
unofficial "stand near them and watch the hit messages" parse) I
wouldnt' think that there would be much to worry about in the
future either.

Splendid
