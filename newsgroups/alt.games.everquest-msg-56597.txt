If your STA is above 100, then you won't be able to jump, nothing else.

Yeah warriors should be worried about their stamina because it directly
effects hit points, but don't get your panties in a bunch because all the
yellow is gone from your little bar.  You just won't be able to run when
your healer dies.  LOL

I haven't seen any conclusive evidence proving me wrong, but if it's out
there, I'd like to know.
