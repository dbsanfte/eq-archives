I grouped with two druids and a ranger there over the last few weeks 
before the harmony nerf.  None of them had ever used harmony.  They'd 
just pull whatever they got and train the zone/guards/other groups if 
they got too much, which wasn't often.  My chanter didn't get to do much 
mezzing because the druids and ranger hadn't figured out that yet either.
