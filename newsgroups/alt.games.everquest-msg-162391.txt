    What junk are you hunting that in two hours plus (I'm even allowing 30
minutes for travel to and from your hunting grounds here) of soloing you
aren't making 100 pp at level 50+?

    They won't need arrows, they'll need a res. There's a reason the post-50
ranger isn't tanking stuff solo, and it's the same reason your druid doesn't
tank stuff solo.

    Arrows lose one half their damage if used on rooted or running mobs.
50%. Do your nukes lose that much damage? Do your spells interrupt against
rooted targets (remember, the specific nerf is arrows breaking root)? Do you
have to cast spells while running against rooted targets? Is your total
resist rate half as bad as the effective resist rate (actual damage
done/theoretical max damage possible) of Archery?

    Do your nukes cost cash to cast? Arrows do, until the ranger reaches
level 59+ and gets Endless Quiver. When you run out of mana, do you have to
run back to town to get more mana? Rangers do, once they run out of arrows
and fletching supplies (and they have an annoying 5% automatic fail rate on
supplies they do bring with them).

    If this is the way Verant thinks, no wonder so many things get messed
up.
