Emerald Jungle is a wild zone. Was a bitch and a half to do a corpse
run there but I'd recomend it.

The undead apes are beyond freaky. =)

You can then in a few levels move into Trak's Teeth, if you haven't
gotten tired of the jungle yet, or into City of Mist. Croud Control
will be essential in the City. Lots of ads, some problems with pathing
mean that you have to set up camp closer to the pulls. Trak's Teeth
has the Ikky BP, if you can kill Crusader Zoglic that carries it. Your
shammy would be very happy. +5 Regen makes Canni a lot easier.
