Well, if they kept the level cap, to get ports personal ports, you'd
have to limit your enchanter level to 41, and be a 41 enchanter/19
druid.  You'd be giving up a *lot* of enchanter spells to get those
personal ports.  Worse, if resistence checks when you tried to cast on
a mob were based on your enchanter level (41) instead of your
character level (60), you'd be useless in high end groups, and you
wouldn't be able to get in lower groups, because as a level 60
character, the mobs would be green to you, and you'd stop the group
from getting XP.
