Sure!  Just bind in Abysmal Sea and then use Gate! :-)

Seriously, though there are spells to port to Natimbi (high level
spells, sold by each Magus), I haven't seen any that port to the
boat in Abysmal.

That's actually rather a drag, and an unfortunate side effect of
the boats not running.  Though I suppose it's possible that the
Nedaria magus is able to send you to Abysmal Sea even without the
stone, i.e. he might be a combination Magus and "boat gnome".
I've never gone to the trouble of making my way to Nedaria's
Landing except by Magus-port, so I don't know.
