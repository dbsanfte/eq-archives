If you read the 9-5 update text it tels you that your Dots are less
effective if they are moving, with the exception of Fear...  They did this
because if the target is running after you while you are Kitting it you
control the path.  You could easyly take down yellow and light red mobs.
With this last patch the lessoned the effect of the penelty, but it is still
there.

The only way to get 100% of your DoT damage is for it to be still( ie
hitting sumting, rooteds...) or feared.  By fearing though you risk it
getting a lot of help, wich they also changed....  at least it seams like
it.  Mobs that use to bring back one or two add's now bring 5 and 6...  one
add  no prob.  two should survive.  3 or more  and I'm planing my run to get
my body back.  I won't train... Rather die then bring my misfortun downon
others.

Hope this help's...  and Paul if they changed that In the last day, I'm
sorry for oppening my mouth..
