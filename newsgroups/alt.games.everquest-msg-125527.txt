Oh, dont get me wrong - bards are a pretty powerful class, when properly
equipped, and have the experience to utilize all of their abilities for full
effect. My point was there are still many things that <are> broken with the
class, and need to be looked at. As it stands, almost every other class has
been, or is in he process of being rebalanced. Bards are left to last
<every> time.

Would it hurt to give us even just a little more melee power? We can sing,
run, and duel wield, using pretty much most weapons (excluding 2 handers),
all at the same time, yet we cant lift up our legs and kick? My level 27
monk can melee better than my 56 bard - its just a little sickening (ok we
have haste etc, but that benefits everyone in the group, and with the
limited melee we do, we need it to come close to the damage of other melee
classes)

I remember when shortly after luclin was released, I couldnt even sing for 2
whole days... Me thinks if any other class couldnt do their primary function
for that long, they would have shut down the servers until it was fixed.

/ooc "35 Voiceless Bard LFG..."

But anyway, im ranting now. We are a far cry from what I would call demi-god
status. Im not saying we are a gimped class, nor am I saying we <need> more
abilities - just to fix whats wrong with what we do have.

Maybe then we might fit the demi-god status ;)
