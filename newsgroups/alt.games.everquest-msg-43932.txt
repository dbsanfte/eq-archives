You can gain access to Paineel pretty quickly by killing Kobolds in the
Warrens. My Iksar Necro did and is now amiable and can train in Paineel.
Also if you kill about a dozen Kolandil fish in the pond at the temple of
life if Qeynos you can train and use the bank in the Qeynos Necro guild.

If you kill enough Kobolds you can become non-kos to the Guards in Erudin. I
haven't actually been in the city yet, but the guards con as indifferent to
my lizard.
