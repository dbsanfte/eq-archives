 While never testing them I'm fairly certain no gate potion will work. I
thought about having someone try their gate hammer just to see what the
message would be.

 You can just log out in a safe spot if your guild is going to clear the
place. In all the times we've had people stuck in there a GM got them
out when they logged back on.  About the only other thing to do in those
situations is give your info to a guildmember and have them run you out
when it's time for everyone to leave.
