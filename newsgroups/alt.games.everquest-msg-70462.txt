I added RAM to my system for EQ, everything worked OK for a few days, then
started having all kinds of problems.  I went from 320MB to 768MB.  I have a
dual-booted system and was only having this issue in Win98 not Win2000.  In
98 it kept telling me at boot that the registry was hosed and was repairing
it.
I did complete reformat and 98 wouldn't even install until I took out the
new RAM.  I got the install in all happy and put the ram back in.  EQ
wouldn't load.  It would say finshed loading world and seize up.  Took out
new ram and it loaded.  Then I took out old ram and put in new and it
loaded.  Added old ram back in just to check and same problem.
I've built many systems and never seen this type of problem!  Is the ram
incompatible with each other or does it have to do with Win98.  I seem to
remember someone posting here some issue with 98 and over 512MB of ram but
my news server sucks and I can't find it.
Any ideas?  It's running well with 2 256MB sticks, but can't add the other 2
128's.

TIA,
Sean...
