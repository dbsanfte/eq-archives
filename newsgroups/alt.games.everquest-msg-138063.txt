Can't remember the name, but there is at least one gecko species.  I
know its in one of my books, but I can't seem to find it.   I'm sure
I'll come across it in the next day or two, now that I'm not looking
for it!

The founders of "Exodus" (one of the oldest "ministries"  for those
who want to "heal from homosexuality") have not only left the group,
but are now a happy same-sex couple fighting the organisation they
started!

I foresee a lifetime of research just to find a value for "n"!  Then
imagine all the debate over naming the "clumps" LOL.   I'm sure you
know about the "six degrees of separation" thing... I wonder how many
degrees of separation would exist between most people under this
n-dimentional sexual space?
