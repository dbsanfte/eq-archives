Bingo!!!   The last time you did a fresh install was a year ago.  A fresh
install of windows is good for about a year before issues start showing up.
If you do regular maintance on the OS (i.e. delete temp files, clean out
cache, clean up the registry ect.) you can get it to last longer, but it
still will lose performance.  Now I know some people have not reloaded in
years and there OS is running fine (their are exceptions).   My guess either
buy or borrow a hard drive from a friend and try a fresh install of the OS
(unless wackn you current HDD).  Get all the latest and greatest drives and
any bios updates.  Oh and if you can avoid using one of those restore discs
from one of those sticker machines do.  I regular copy of windows is much
better IMO.
