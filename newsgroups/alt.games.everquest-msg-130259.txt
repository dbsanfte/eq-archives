I saw this when I installed Velious.  It seems that the default
install directory for SoV is different from the default install
directory for the base Everquest package.  SoV needs to be installed
in the same directory as EQ, otherwise all the new mobs in Velious
will have human models.  If this is your problem, just uninstall SoV,
then reinstall taking care to put it in the correct directory.
