A couple of reasons you may want it:

-At the higher levels, people do appreciate what each class can do,
IMHO.  Necros add a lot to groups and a lot more people at the higher
levels know that.

-LDON requires chain pulling groups, killing constantly.  A mana
battery for this reason can be very advantageous.  Nothing is worse
that medding while on a timer.  Add to this the ability to add
reasonable DPS and several other utilities, (mezzes come to mind, plus
there are several dungeons with lots of undead) and the necro is a
good addition.
