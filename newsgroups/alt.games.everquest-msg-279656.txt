	Basically I'm going to do all of that in Vanguard when it comes out. 
(because vanguard wont have a bazaar or the stupid EQ economy and 
mudflation)

	I enjoyed EQ the most when I didn't have any expansions and no bazaar 
gear. The first time I ever felt that EQ was "fucked up" was when I 
spent ages trying to get a few pieces of my sol ro armour and then a 
bard I knew bought me another piece in the bazaar, for 50pp.
