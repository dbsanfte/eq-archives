Once I watched a druid friend of mine accidentally cast a port
to a Velious zone on a computer which didn't have Velious installed.

Mind you, the account was activated for Velious, but the zones
weren't installed.

He got kicked back to the character select screen, and it showed
his druid in Cobalt Scar (or whatever zone it was, I forget).  Of
course he couldn't log back in, it said the zone was unavailable.

He logged in a different character, petitioned, and was told by
a GM that a higher-level GM would be contacted to attempt to
restore the character.

In the meantime we logged in the same account on a different
computer which did have the Velious zones installed, and got
his character out.  Not that it mattered, because shortly
therafter the GM did actually restore the character.

So, it can be really messy if you zone into a place you don't
have the files for.  You'd expect the code to check for something
like that and handle it more gracefully.

The interesting thing was that after his character was restored,
he had in his inventory a somewhat expensive item that he had
sold the day before.  And the person he sold it to also had the
item.  So it occurred to us that an underhanded person could use
something like this to duplicate very high-end items.  /shrug
