So, I've got a 40 Halfling Ranger who's almost grown completely out of her
twinked Gothic Ringmail.  Finally saved up for and got my two Silver
Chitin Wristbands, and still have 4kpp banked.  Also, between fishing
(cobalt cod), tailoring (leather padding), and foraging (tufts of dire
wolf fur, other stuff), I can pull down upwards of 1kpp an hour if I'm
motivated to properly multitask tradeskills.  The problem is, I'm looking
for motivation.  A couple of ideas about next steps in equipment would be
appreciated. :)

I've already done the POK quests for focus II healing, mana preservation,
and extended enhancement, which are set up for easy swaps.  Also, I have
the cheapest horse (mostly a toy, but..).  Unbuffed AC is currently at
800, and HP at 1200-1300 (from memory).  I've sat in Bazaar the last few
nights, searching for an obvious upgrade that might last the next dozen
levels, or so, but no bells have rung.

A couple of points about my play style.  I like to solo xp (actually,
two-box with a 27 Chanter for mana, haste, and slows), but I've been doing
more LDoNs of late, when I find the time.  Up until Tuesday, I always
found myself in LDoN groups where someone else was tanking; that night, I
got thrust into that role, and by the reaction of the group (explicitly
sought after the fact) I carried it out competently enough.  But, that,
the hard adventure the next night (no main tanking for me, but we got
spanked, failed a 24 collect with 1 left), and stuff I've read on the web
all make me think I could up my AC and HP/STA more than I have (STR and
DEX don't seem to be a problem at about 170 each self-buffed).  Oh, and
I've got all my weapon skills at least to 180, so if a specific weapon
might help, I could shift to that.

With that said, I leave it to the collective wisdom of the group.  Thanks!
