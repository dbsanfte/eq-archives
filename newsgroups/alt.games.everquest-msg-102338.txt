Interestingly, I ran into someone insisting that he had a LORE Centi
LS in GBay today in /ooc. I ooc'd that I'd give him 90p (all the
character had on her at the time) to see this sword. Several minutes,
no public response, so I ooc'd "Odd how <name> suddenly falls silent
when asked to put up". I get a tell from him saying the sword is on
his Ranger in KC and it's too far away to log and run him here for a
measly 90p (convenient, huh?). Being in the annoying mood I am, and
since several others in the zone were involved in the "debate", I
passed this info on in ooc. Someone else turned around and upped my
offer to 1k pp to see the sword. I told him I'd log my druid, port to
him, pay him 200p off my druid to see it, and bring him to GBay to
take the other guy up on his 1k offer as well... 1200pp just to SHOW 2
people a LORE Centi Longsword. Even if neither of us payed out, it's
worth the gamble, right?

Silence from Mr "The character that has it is too far away"...
Surprised? Not at all...
