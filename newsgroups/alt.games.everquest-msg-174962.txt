Bazaar is a place to buy and sell your unwanted gear or tradeskill stuff or
just about anything really (and I do mean anything seen ppl selling summoned
black bread and the likes) it is not a place to go and kill things (there is
a arena there so you could go and kill your friends i spose).
as for paludal this is a great place to fight I would head there about 15-16
as much younger you would have problems finding a group, it is very crowded
though on most servers.
you get to luclin either by a port from a druid/wizzy, by using the spires
found in north karana (long dangerous run at 11 though) or if you have
plains of power go via plane of knowledge.

no your asking at the right place but there are numerous sites around that
can tell you most of this stuff.
