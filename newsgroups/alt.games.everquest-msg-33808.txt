Yes, some of the higher level mobs will certainly do this sort of
thing.

In Kael Drakkar, for example, I've more than once seen whole
raids instructed to stop beating on mob X until his berserk ends.
Why? wish I could tell you, seems to work more like a
discipline than the berserk mode I'm familiar with in warriors;
if it were truely berserk, then the only ways it would wear off
would be if he were healed or dead.  But he seems to riposte
every blow, meaning that monks and rangers are dead in seconds,
and everyone else tanking him also takes outrageous damage...
for 30 seconds or so.  (rats, I wrote "mob X" intending
to put in the name, but I can't recall it.  Adjudant, perhaps?)

I wish I could give you details as to which mobs and what
those states they go into are, but I've never had it all explained
to me.  I'm pretty sure at 7th level you'll not get near anything
that behaves this way.  Quite possibly not till you face mobs
leveled higher than 50.

That's not to say that mobs down near your level don't have
their own "kill em now and fast" behaviours.  In a few
levels, for example, you may find yourself in the Oasis
hunting orcs.  If an orc priest should come with a pull,
or add himself in later, he -must- be killed or otherwise
prevented from casting, or you'll find him healing not
just himself (annoying all on its own) but the bigger,
scarier A Orcs that your group was barely able to
take down.  You end up doing enough damage to kill
that A Orc two or three times over before it finally
falls... unless someone eliminates the priest or manages
a large damage kill shot that pushes the A Orc into
death before the heal goes off.

Mobs that Frenzy (which is to say come to the aid
of their fellows) are another "must be stopped or
killed fast" type of mob, even at your level; if you
let that scrawny gnoll wander off with a coterie of
tanks following and beating on it, it may well manage
to get to help, and suddenly instead of one almost
dead and running gnoll, you have two burly and
full health gnolls wanting to know who's been trying
to roll their little brother for his milk money.

In addition to Killer Nuke, you might look at root,
snare, fear, and stun, as ways to deal with problematic
mobs of one sort or another.  (OK, you won't get
Fear as a wizard.  Heck, I don't get Snare as a cleric,
either.)
