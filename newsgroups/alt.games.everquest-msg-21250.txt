I was playing in a group today, in between jobs at the moment, so I started
playing at about 10am.

After a couple of hours camping dervishes with a really good group, one says
"jikes 4am, got to go", then another says "ah, 6am I got to go too". What a
great game, that you get to play with people all over the world. (After 6
years as a regular internet user I still marvel at that).

Shame that the group had to plit up, just when I was brewing a full pot of
coffee, getting ready for a long day of levelling.
