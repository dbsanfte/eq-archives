Yes, primarily by encouraging more casual players.

How would it do that?   If a spot has the best XP, it's still the
best XP, just doubled.

That it does but I don't see how that's a "nice effect" on its
own.   Due to double XP players can level multiple characters
almost as fast as they can level one (ignoring the hard-core
players who don't care anyway.)

Doubtful.   They're far more likely to simply switch to an alt
(and/or crafting) when they're out of double XP than quit
playing.  That is if they simply don't continue getting normal
XP.

As a guess you're a more casual player.

EQ2 has it as well, but it's called 'vitality' there (and both adventuring 
and
crafting have their own double XP counters.)

IMO the primary benefit is simply a player isn't necessarily left behind
as quickly.  If someone takes a night or weekend off they're able to
catch up with their regular group due to gaining inflated XP the next
time they play.  It won't totally compensate but it's a big help in
keeping somewhat casual groups together.
