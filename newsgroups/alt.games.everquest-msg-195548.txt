Lots of people come here (or at least used to) to make thier first, last and
only post, which was almost always a rant about how much they hated the
game, and how glad they were that they were quitting.

Somewhere along the lines, people got tired of saying "Nobody here knows
you, nobody gives a damn if you're playing or not, or why you quit, nor are
we going to instantly quit the game just because you decided you don't like
it anymore" and instead condenced it down to a simple exchange.

"You're quitting?

...  ok.

Can I have your stuff?"
