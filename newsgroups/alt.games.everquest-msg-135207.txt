So you never mention a wife and kids in public (or would not if you
had them).

I love guys like you.   If you have a photo of your kids on your desk,
that's fine, nothing sexual there (never mind where kids come from,
LOL).  If I have a photo of my lover on my desk, that's all about sex.
Yeah, right.
