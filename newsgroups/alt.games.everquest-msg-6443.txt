Oh, I'm perfectly aware of what he's saying.  He's saying he's a
filthy hypocrite.  The act of twinking is perfectly fine and
acceptable, as long as he is on the receiving end of it.  When the
phat lewts are not going directly into his own grubby little hands,
that's when he gets on his moral high horse.

There's no two ways about it.  How you can sit there and defend such a
blatantly hypocritical an two-faced statement is beyond me.  Twinking
is the act of receiving goods or services with little to no effort
taken to aquire the item on the receiver's end.  Giving your lowbie
monk a FBSS is twinking.  Giving that same FBSS to your guild's
resident monk without receiving anything in return is twinking.
Handing the same FBSS to a total stranger you meet out in the East
Common's tunnel, whether it be for exceptional roleplaying, or just as
a kind gift, that's twinking.  Selling the FBSS for far below market
value, that's twinking.  The mere fact that giving that FBSS to
someone other than your own characters does not lessen the fact that
it is twinking, and so obviously in Brandon's own warped mind,
"cheating".

What Brandon and yourself are trying to do is rationalize the process.
Which is, as stated before in this thread, bullshit.
