I used to know a man named Kelly.  Always gave me the creeps tho.  You know
the kind, you shake their hand and then you wipe your hand on your pants
unconsciously.  Gave him the benefit of the doubt cuz he was a registered
nurse who worked with mentally disabled adults in some kind of homelike
setting.  Turns out he was also a major druggie who, when his roommate was
away for a few days, decided to tell all his contacts that he was going to
visit his kid 3 states away so he wouldn't be disturbed and started cooking
up methamphetamine in his apartment.  Ended up blowing up the building, had
to have him identified from dental records, the body was charred beyond
recognition.  The apartment was on the groud floor, could have taken out all
3 floors of the building.  Thank god no one else was hurt.  Everyone else
got out ok and the building had to be razed and rebuilt.  I go past there
sometimes, can't even tell anymore that it happened.
