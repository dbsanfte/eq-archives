At level 55 you get the Trueshot discipline, which, when activated,
will allow you to hit for up to twice your max damage, with an
increased chance to hit as well.  Also, there are two aa abilities you
will be looking forward to: Endless Quiver (costs nine aa points),
which gives you and endless supply of whatever arrow is currently in
your ammo slot, and Archery Mastery (three levels, costs 18 aa points
to max out), which increases your archery damage by 100% at level
three.  I'm currently 8 points away from endless quiver, and let me
tell you, I'm drooling already.  Using a 5 damage arrow, a
nightmarewood compound bow, and Trueshot, I've already crit for 690,
and quite regularly crit in the 300-400 range.  I can't *wait* to have
an endless supply of 10+ damage arrows!
