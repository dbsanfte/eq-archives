The incentive to play a warrior has diminished as it is. It's a long road 
of dependence with their greatest glory not to be experienced until post-
50, thanks to uber twinking and KEI. My opinion is that anything that 
contributes to that where *any* class is concerned is probably a bad 
thing. That was all I was saying.

Aside from that, I assume that this degree of twinking is meant purely to  
help you fly through the lower levels as quickly as possible. I'm sure it 
will accomplish that.
