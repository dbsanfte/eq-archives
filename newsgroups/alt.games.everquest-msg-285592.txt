Heh - to each their own I guess - EQ was fun for 5 years, but WoW just
blows it out of the water.

Vastly more fun leveling 1-59
Great scripted enounters in instances
-- (the final fights in Gnomer and ZF are incredible)
Great quests
Great storylines
Griffon bombing runs
Vastly more customizable UI
Much better PvP
Female NE /dance emote
Griffon bombing runs (repeating the quest gives no xp/rep but man is it
it's too much of a blast not to).

Not that they're perfect, whoever's idea of content the silithus grind and
AD grind gear quests were belongs on the EQ dev team, not the WoW dev
team.
