I would like to increase the font size of the Text Display, where
messages are sent and received. Eyesight is not what it used to be. I
know how to change the .ini config. to change the chat font size and
adjust chat line spaceing.

I am sure the insturctions are somewhere in the documentation, but a
quick scan produced nothing, so, I'll see if I can find a answer to
this EQ question where I always find answers to EQ questions....here.
