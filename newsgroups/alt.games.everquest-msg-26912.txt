Now I'm a fan of EQ and for a while I played it more than what I think we
all know is healthy so I'm not passing any judgements (not that anyone would
give a rats if I was! :) ) just giving some friendly advice from one eq
lover to another. Now this post is somewhat off topic but we are a
community, so if you have a problem with this post then simply stop reading
it on move to the next topic.

If this is your situation then you should be playing less than those not in
your situation. I was at a place on Sunday night (Lotel for those of you in
Sydney) where I saw a person who used to go to my school. Now this guy
obviously didn't get out much and didn't really fit in at all. Now there is
nothing wrong with this guy, just as there doesn't seem to be anything wrong
with you, and no doubt if he comes back a few times, he'll go from stranger
to acquaintance, maybe to friends and if he so desires he may find someone
he wants to see more of (and hopefully that person will feel the same way,
if not then big deal, look elsewhere!). If he had your attitude he would
have said "Oh, I didn't really fit in there, I'm going to go home and play
computer games" and that would be the end of it... When we're talking about
someone else does that sound like a good idea? I lived in a different city
last year and EQ was a great time waster when you can't be stuffed going out
soloing a new crowd or the weather is crap etc etc but it should never be a
persons main "social" interaction with people. Anyway, bla bla bla, all I'm
saying is that just because you haven't had much success to date doesn't
mean you should give up. At the risk of sounding like a complete wanker I
just want to say that the pursuit of true happiness is not something you
should give up on just because you haven't found it yet, you should be
looking for that your whole life! EQ won't find that for you.

By the way, I'm not suggesting that the rest of your life isn't fantastic, I
don't have any idea what it's like so all I'm saying here related to your
"Acute Female Repulsion Syndrome".

And as for your "Acute Female Repulsion Syndrome" what a load of crap! Turn
your computer off, go buy yourself some new clothes (good for a little
confidence boost), have a shave, do your hair, whatever it is you need to
get your version of that "look" you were talking about and go gettem!

Does anyone out there agree with me on this???

Shodokan, Rallos Zek.
