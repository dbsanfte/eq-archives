Well, yes. That and (even more useful) for pulling. It's a no mana way
to aggro mobs and start rounding up a quad from max distance to minimize
the beating I take when trying to form them up.  This is less of a
concern since I got my epic, but before that I found that I was most
likely to die on a quad at the beginning than after I'd gotten them
grouped up.

There are also weird  group/duo situations (including AoE groups at
later levels) where you want the wizard to be the puller and the SoTF is
an excellent tool for picking off the ones that you don't want to detour
to run within "normal" aggro range of.
