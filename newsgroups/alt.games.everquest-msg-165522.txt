I can.
I had a 58th level cleric try to rez me with the 0% rez. She claimed there
was not any difference in the rezzes other than higher mana cost! (actually
what she said was the rez effects wear off faster and we were not in a
hurry. I got away from that group... quickly... btw I died because she was
using only Complete heal for efficiency... She started casting so late I
didn't see her 'don't run away I'm complete healing you' message until after
I zoned to bind.)
Can you really imagine a warrior, sk, ranger, rogue, or monk making it
through 55 levels and not learning how to assist ma and not break mez? I
don't have to imagine it. I seem to end up grouped with it at least once a
week.
