Got a question - has anyone else noticed that an Avocet Charm they were wearing
disappeared after the last patch?  My shaman had one one, and I logged in after the patch
and it was gone.  I checked other characters that had them and they, too, were gone.
Was this Item taken out of the game because it had Charm in the name yet was a neck slot
item?  I don't recall seeing it mentioned in the patch message.  Kinda pissed off because
it was a focus item that still worked for some of my DoTs.
