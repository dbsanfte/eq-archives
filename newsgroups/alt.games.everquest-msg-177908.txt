Believe me there are still plenty of players.  Be glad that DL is down to 40
people, even with that many the zone is a mad house.  There are not fewer
players, they are just spread out over more zones.  Everytime an expansion
is added that's more zones to hang out in (thank goodness!)  A fair number
of the DL crowd is now hanging out is Dawnshroud Peaks you can tell, because
it has the same flavor "You asshole! Learn to announce your trains!" "I need
a rezz" "Hey! you #$%$^ KSer!" "I need a rezz"  "I SAID the (insert name
here) were camped-you Ftard!"  "I need a rezz" "Anyone casting KEI?"  "I
need a rezz" "Don't pull from our camp MORON!" "I need a rezz" etc.......
