>I see people referring to farming.  What exactly is farming?

Generally, it means a repetitive no-risk boring activity.  Often bad game
designers will put items on low-level monsters that high level characters
want/need.  If the item is rare, or wanted in large quantities, people will
kill them for hours or days, just for the item.

By extension, it means most anything that's time consuming and not fun in
itself (even if it's risky and level-appropriate), but done in order to
get something you want.  People farm experience in boring groups, farm
raid encounters with 50 other people, and farm the bazaar for underpriced
items, etc.
