What card is in your laptop? I've got a dell with a mobile radeon (7500 
I think) which isn't supported. There is a long thread on the CoH boards 
with ppl stuck with this or similarly unsupported cards (which, btw, was 
the high-end card available just a year ago when I got my laptop). G'luck.

I can still play on my desktop, but I'm having a hard time getting 
interested in CoH (I'm still a newcomer to EQ, and CoH seems a little 
'shallow' to me :-p  ), so it's no biggie.
