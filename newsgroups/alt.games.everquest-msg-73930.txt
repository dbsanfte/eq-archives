I personally never charge for ports....and normally cancel the trade of
anyone offering PP.  However for TL's i always ask for 2pp.  why?  Because
for all TL's excluding the Spire Locations (Gfay, Tox, NK, DL) we have to
use a "small portal chips" as a reagent.  I guess you have had a couple of
bad experiences.... its incredibly unfair to paint all wizards with the same
brush.  I have met Druids who have refused to sow me unless i pay them 10pp,
I've met chanter who refuse to Give me Clarity II unless i pay 20pp.  That
doesnt mean i think all of those "Classes" are that way....i just write down
those peoples names and next time they need a port... i charge them.  Fair i
think.
