My impression is that gear at least the equal of the LDoN 1492 items is
dropping like candy.  If they had only released OoW first instead of GoD I
might still be playing.  Then again, SOE said they completely redid OoW from
scratch after the summit, so if OoW had been released at that time probably
would have been equally wretched as GoD.
