Ditto on this one. Pre-bought mine there because last time they were
the only ones that had it on time and they went out like hot cakes so
reserved and paid for mine in advance. Fry's Electronics (may only be
here in So Cal) advertised that they would have it in-store no later
then 4pm Tuesday. Funny part about this was they advertised they'd
have Velious in on a Tuesday last year, when they opened, it wasn't
there for another three days. When I went that Tuesday some poor wage
slave was getting an ass chewing from the local EQ geeks who were very
pissed off that the paper and telephoned store information told them
it would be in.
