probably some treehugging druid that thinks noone should
ever attack wolves bears etc.  Don't worry about it.

At 3 or 4 in MT i would say keep killing stuff and as you
get a little higher, maybe  around 4 or 5, head to the area
by the wall.  As a rogue you will want to start looking for
a group now that your in the 4 to 5 range.  Rogue is
primarily a group oriented class.  There will be very few
things you will be able to solo as a rogue as you get higher
in levels, not to mention you will want to be behind the mob
with it beating on a tank, so you can backstab from level 10
on.
