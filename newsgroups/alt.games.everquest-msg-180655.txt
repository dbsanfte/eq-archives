You'll have better luck in a couple of weeks.  My guild (on Drinal) has been
all abuzz over what froggie alts we're going to make.  I plan on making a
paladin so that I can get a taste of what tanking is like; others are gonna
make wizzies or clerics.  And I'm certain we won't be alone; lots of "uber"
folks will be rolling and playing froggies for the novelty of it.

I fully expect to see a 60+ frogluk PC within a week of LoY being released.

So if you're looking to group with other twinked-out low-level characters,
bide two weeks' time.  I myself plan to drop a few plat on twinking out my
froggie.  I guess it's too much to hope for that Luminant Heraldic Armor
will be frogluk-wearable.  /sigh
