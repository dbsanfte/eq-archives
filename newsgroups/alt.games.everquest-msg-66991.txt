as much as i like eq, i have to agree with a lot of this... most models look
like absolute shit... ogres look decent... any small-medium size races
wearing plate armor look like they are 8 months pregnant... most the female
chars look like they are on some major roids.  i have the system to run all
the models, but they are all turned off cuz i like the old look better
