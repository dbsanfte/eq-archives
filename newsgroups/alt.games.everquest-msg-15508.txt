You may have lost sight of the original point, but I haven't.

People were seeming to suggest that acronyms were ok to use in EQ, but
abbreviations were not. Now it turns out you have manufactured some meaning
for "abbreviation" that doesn't actually exist. What it suggest to me that
whatever reason people may have for not liking the words "plz" or "thx", it
has nothing to do with whether it is an abbreviation or not.
