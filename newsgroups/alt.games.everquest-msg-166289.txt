Sure, but they'd have been outcasts.  No place for Rogue in the rigid
society of the "mainstream" Iksars in Cabilis.  And they didn't want
to go to the trouble to make a starting area / home base for Iksar
outcasts (at least that's what the published response was to a question
about allowing Iksars to be "agnostic" and/or have other diety options
besides the mandatory Cazic Thule).

I'd like to play an Ogre Paladin follower of Rallos Zek myself.  Given
the "no respect for the fallen, who've proven their weakness" theme of
Rallos Zek, it's not even slightly diffcult to imagine a cult of Rallos
that views the Undead as an abomination that must be destroyed.  And,
as a plus, a follower of Rallos Zek would see killing the Shin Lord
for his weapon as a holy duty, rather than a painful moral conflict.
You could even have the Ghoulbane quest NPCs refuse to talk to them.
For that matter, a Paladin follower of Rallos Zek of any race would be
cool, it sure looks like a lot of the Paladin quests were set up for
exactly that sort of callous individual.
