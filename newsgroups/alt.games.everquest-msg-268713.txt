Not necessary.  You don't have to do any quests on the island, except the
first one which selects your class.

Just talk to the ambassador in the hut on the beach and ask to join the city
of your choice.  (Which ambassador is there is determined by the alignment you
chose at character creation.)   He directs you to an NPC to speak to, which is
right outside the hut.   Once you're done with that, just go ring the bell.
