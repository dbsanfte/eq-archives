Its possible I suppose. But the level of organization required to keep a 
raid moving is considerably higher. The xp would have to be considerably 
higher for them to even break even most of the time. 

Thus I'm still skeptical that the average raid would xp faster than 
single groups, especially if that group is doing quests too.
