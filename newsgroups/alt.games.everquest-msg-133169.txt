Unless I'm in a group with my friends or guildmates, I hate need before
greed groups and I normally won't join them.  The reason for this is that
too often I see these people get the item they "need" and the next day I see
them selling said item in EC or on the bazaar channel.  If it's a pickup
group I prefer the random, added with if you got the item then you don't get
another til everyone else has gotten one.  Also by order of entrance into
the group works too.
