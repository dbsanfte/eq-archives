  In that case, you are crossposting your whining about
off-topic posts on _your newsgroup_ into this newsgroup,
which is innappropritely off-topic.   ;-)

  So spam is okay if it does not "draw responses."
Interesting idea.  I will consider it.
  An alternative theory is that spam which draws no
response whatever is just "bad spam."    :-)

  I disagree.  Hal's off-topic spam posting was designed
to INFORM the countless "victims" of the "evil, Jew-
controlled mass-media" of the "fact" that they are being
manipulated, and what they can do about it.  Nothing
more.   If _you_ wish to engage in senseless flame-
warring, the blame for this ugly tendency lies entirely with
you, and there is nothing to be gained by projecting your
own weaknesses upon those you perceive as your
enemies, such as Hal.  It is self-evident that Hal is far
too busy shouting to the whole world that "the sky is
falling" to bother with such trivial pursuits as flame-wars...
