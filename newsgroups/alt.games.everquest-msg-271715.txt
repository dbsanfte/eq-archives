For an example of this, consider DAoC.  Each year, there has been an
expansion that has included an engine update, each time bringing it up
to the forefront of MMORPG graphics.  I haven't played the latest expansion
yet, but I've seen movies made by players (so they actually reflect what is
in the game, as opposed to SOE movies), and the environment looks as good or
better than EQ2.  I think EQ2 might still have a little more detailed
player models, but not by much.

Furthermore, Mythic can keep this up indefinitely, because they are using
the Gamebryo engine from NDL, rather than one developed in-house like SOE
uses.  And since their engine is one used by a lot of games, there are
third-party companies that have developed tools and extensions for it.  One
of the DAoC expansions added a new tree system, for example, that is
available off the shelf from a third party.  You won't see Sony able to go
pick up off the shelf extension to the SOE engine--anything like that, they
will have to develop in-house.
