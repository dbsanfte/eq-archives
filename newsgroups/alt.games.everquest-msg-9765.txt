Well, I finally decided to try the second part of the Iksar shaman
cudgel quest (the part where you need to get the three Iksar outcast
skulls).  I found the underwater entryway (in East Cabilis, at about
600, -400, there where the barrels and debris are floating).  However,
when I get into the room and try to jump up onto the balcony, I can't
get up there! (there are no ladders to climb either).  No matter how
many times I use the up arrows and the spacebar to jump, I can't jump
up the wall.  (I even tried levitate too and that doesn't work
either).  How do I get up onto the balcony?  What am I doing wrong?
Is there another way to get up there?

Thanks in advance,
