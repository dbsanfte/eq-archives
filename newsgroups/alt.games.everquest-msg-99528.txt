Sure, and this has resulted in the Show EQ guys getting it wrong <G>

They have got their numbers by knowing the ZEM and the exact level of
the mobs that they are killing, watching the 1/330 tick over to 2/330
... n/330 and then back calculating what the xp required would be to
make this happen at this speed.

So they are now saying that (basically) the modifier which used to jump
at hell levels now is a straight line progression from 30 to 49/50.

This is not how VI have implemented it as this would have forced them to
change the absolue numbers of all characters (between 30 and 49) current
experience. To avoid doing this VI put in an additional multiplier to xp
earned during levels 30 - 49 and left the basic xp required table alone.

Really it doesn't make any difference since the end numbers are the
same.
Also the numbers are on such a simple straight line that they are easy
to guess.

Does that make you any more confused ?
