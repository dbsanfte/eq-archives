Wondering if anyone else has tried this and had better luck than me. 
Previous to the halloween event you'd get a note from the captain guy
at that new primiordial malice camp near the drakes in mtn rathe of
high level dark elf trainers. You then gave this note to who he told
you to (a mage in an FBR) At that time you got no note to give to
izera in sro though she said for you to give her a note.

After the halloween event, you do get a note to give to izera so they
fixed that part at least. However, you go to sro and give her the note
and nothing happens as in there is no ding sound, no negative comment,
no xp, no faction, nothing though the npc in mtn rathe told you to
give it to her for further instructions or something. 

I thought maybe it was faction, so my dark elf cleric of innoruuk
killed gixx and d'orn a few more times to raise primoridial malice
from indiff to amiable. Gix and dorn are still at lowest indiff though
I'm now amiable with malice  However at amiable the same thing still
happens, no negative comment when giving izera the note, no faction,
no reaction, no new item, no further quest,  nothing. 

I wrote in to the thread on the developer board for the first time it
was not working, now after the halloween event I wrote in again since
the new part appears to be not working. Just wondering if anyone else
tried it and knows anymore. 

I have a 55 druid on the same account with the dark elf, but it is
still scowl after killing dorn and gix even more times (dark elf
cleric started dubious) so I'd guess only evils can easily raise it.
So due to only being able to check with my dark elf cleric, its a bit
of a bother to have her run all the way to mtn rathe and get the note
to bring to izera in SRO just to find the quest is broken when at
level 37 she is off doing xp in better areas.
