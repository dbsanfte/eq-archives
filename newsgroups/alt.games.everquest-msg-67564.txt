First off you need a "GIANT" snake fang. 
Gnoll Fang
Hunting Bow

How familiar with BB are you?

The gnolls on the bridge between the "Resting area" (the open area at
the bottom of the ramp) and the "Elite Ledge" (the small ledge area
where the 2 Elites spawn) usually to carry Hunting Bows.

All of the Gnolls in BB can drop Gnoll fangs except for the pups.

You can auction for a Giant snake fang from the "Snake Ledge" or camp
one for yourself at level 8-9. The snakes on the ledge do not help one
another.

Cheers
