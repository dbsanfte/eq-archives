I'd still leave a group where the cleric thought it
should melee and bash instead of heal. This is a 
fun 56 and up "solo because I can" thing for them.
Before 56 they get jack, except bash. I don't see them
using bash in a group either, at least I hope not.

This is pretty fun for a high level cleric if they are bored grouping,
but I think it will be a good thing that they have those 96 percent
resurrects... ahahaha.
