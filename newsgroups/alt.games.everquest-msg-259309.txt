Are you saying that, as a shaman (level 35 atm), I will one day be able to 
actually just med again rather than doing that silly canni-dance? It does 
stink that I can't take advantage of the new HP regen mechanic. Btw, the 
new regen doesn't apply to mana too, does it?

I just swapped out about 11 points of WIS gear (bringing me down to like 
167) for close to 200 HP in HP/STA gear last night in the Bazaar. Sounds 
like maybe I should hang onto that WIS gear.
