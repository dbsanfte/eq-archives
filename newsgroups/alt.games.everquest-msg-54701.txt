I do think it's much verant's fault but I still think as more games come
out that  more problems with the seemingly unsupported SB live cards are
going to show up.  I think Verant probably doesn't know how to fix it
and are getting as much support from Creative as SB live owners get, in
coming up with the solution.  As I said i was playing devil's advocate,
not trying to be a VAK per se.
