It's not actually stated in the policy as far as I know, but the way
Dark Tyger described it is how the policy is applied in a practical
sense... The GM is the judge on a name's fitness, as he/she is the
person who Verant hired to enforce the rules.  Just like in real life,
it's the police officer who really decides what laws are enforced and
which ones aren't, for all practical purposes, simply because they are
the one's who will be doing the enforcing.

"No one has the answer, but one thing is true
You've got to turn on evil, when it's coming after you
You've got to face it down, and when it tries to hide
You've got to go in after it, and never be denied
Time is running out
Let's roll" - Neil Young, "Let's Roll"
