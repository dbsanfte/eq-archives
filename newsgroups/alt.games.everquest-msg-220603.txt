You are so full of shit.

Let's examine this:

Option A: Spay/neuter cat, let cat roam free
Option B: Leave the cat as-is, keep cat locked inside all day
Option C: Leave the cat as-is, let cat roam free

I advocate A. Which do you choose?

And FWIW, you are right- adoption was a bad off-the-cuff example. By the 
same token, your extrapolation that neutering 3 year old children is the 
same as neutering a cat was a  preposterous straw man I should not have 
risen to.
