Those two observations are entirely related.

You can only get weapon skill increases from mobs that can give you
exp.  This *usually* means "blue or higher", but there are times that
you can get exp from a green mob.

I believe the rule is that for a green mob that is just one level down
from "blue", you get %50% of the exp you would have gotten had it
still been blue to you.  Two levels down, you get 25%.  Three or
more levels down, you get 0%.  However, this might only apply at
higher levels, I'm not sure.
