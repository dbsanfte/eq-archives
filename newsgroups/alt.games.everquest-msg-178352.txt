The Game
(Print the Lyrics)


Tell me exactly what am I supposed to do
Now that I have allowed you to beat me
Do you think that we could play another game
Maybe I could win this time

I kind of like the misery you put me through
Darlin' you can trust me completely
If you even try to look the other way
I think that I could kill this time

It doesn't really seem I'm getting through to you
Though I see you weeping so sweetly
I think that you might have to take another taste
A little bit of hell this time

Lie to me

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me

You always wanted people to remember you
To leave your little mark on society
Don't you know your wish is coming true today
Another victim dies tonight

Lie to me,

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me


Is she really telling lies again
Doesn't she realize she's in danger

Lie to me,

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life in the battle that ends this day

Is she not right?
Is she insane?
Will she now
Run for her life now that she lied to me

The little bitch she went and she told, A LIE
And now she will never tell another, A LIE
the little bitch she went and told, A LIE
NEVER FUCKING LIE TO ME!
