It's not just tradeskills.  My monk uses disarm as a taunt (for what little
it's worth) and hadn't gotten a skill increase in I don't know how long.  In
one 1-minute time period I got 4 skill increases.  That was in a full night
of fighting in a group with an enchanter and me as main tank.  Those were the
only skill increases the entire night.  Next night, exact repeat, got 3
skill increases within a minute and none for the rest of the night.

But I don't have a great deal of confidence in the "random" number
generator, not after going on a 17 for 21 failed feigns death-fest the other
night.

Yeah, or an int-impaired iksar monk.  Pottery is definitely the easiest
tradeskill to raise.
