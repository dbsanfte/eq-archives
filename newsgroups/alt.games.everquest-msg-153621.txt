You can't bind in Chardok...at least, not at the zone line.  I haven't tried
binding by the bank in Chardok...if I remember I'll try tonight.

In Kael you can only bind by...at least the EW zone line...don't know about
the WL zone line.  I've tried to bind my CR mule closer to the arena but
failed.

Hole: pretty sure you can bind anywhere.

As someone else mentioned, you can bind in Fear (last I checked) and Growth,
but not Hate.  It would surprise me if you can in Air...that zone has lots
of rules.

I've never tried to bind in Howling Stones...and I don't plan on trying any
time soon. <g>
