Get a haste item, SCHW if you can afford them, FBSS if not.   Offence
is the best defence.

Might want to grab a Weighty Polearm for a few hundred plat (no more
than 250) to upgrade your 2 handed damage somewhat.  They are a super
common drop from Plane of Justice and recommended level of 50 so no
use to twinks.

Weighty Polearm (29/34 AC 15 Agi +15 Fire Resist +10 HP +35)

Sarnak Battle Shield (AC 25 Str +5 Sta +5 Magic Resist +10 Fire Resist
+10 Cold Resist +10 HP +40) from Chardok is a better shield (IMO) than
the one you have and very common these days, should be able to get one
for around 500pp.
