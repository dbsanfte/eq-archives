Oh come on now.  I can tank those as a bard.  (OK, I cheat and slow them 
31%, but it's still not that hard.)  I'm way, way down on HP, but even 
with nothing but Aego on me I have 3200hp, which makes Cheals fairly 
efficient.  I know I have more AC than some of the warriors I see tanking 
there, sometimes by a fair amount.
