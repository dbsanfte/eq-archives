I'm in a guild with a lot of people who love just playing around and 
having a good time, so it's easy.  I don't look at it as grinding so much 
as a chance to talk with friends.  I do a fair amount of exploring, and 
testing my soloing limits, and have a lot of fun doing that as well.  I 
break that up with tradeskills and quests as well.  With the zones I now 
have access to, I can get an AA in under an hour in a mediocre pickup 
group, faster in a good group, so it doesn't take all that long to rack 
them up.
