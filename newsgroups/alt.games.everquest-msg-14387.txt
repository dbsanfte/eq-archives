Could you please explain why this is supposedly a bad thing?

So the monster was standing around doing nothing while they
were setting up their attack.  They hadn't attacked it yet, the
monster wasn't attacking back.  That sounds normal, not exploitive.
What would be the harm in that?

When Vox is aggroed from a distance (but not damaged), she runs
up and down  between her pedestal and the rockpile.  She doesn't 
go chasing all over Permafrost after the object of her wrath.  
Bizarre, perhaps, but not exploitable, since you can't do any damage
to her without entering into her lair either (and if you do
do damage, she'll summon your butt from anywhere in the zone,
so you can't use her pathing to evade her, either).

Conquest's argument is that they weren't cheating -- cheating
implies getting an unfair advantage in some fashion (even by
Verant's own written definition of "exploit").  Even if
the monster was not behaving as it "should", if the unintended
behavior was not helping them in any way, where's the "cheat"?
I think that's a valid question, and one that deserves an answer.

If I find a way to make Nagafen do the Macarena, but it doesn't
help me win any fights against him, am I "cheating" just because
I'm tweaking a quirk in the game code?

Another of Verant's complaints is that during the actual fight,
the dragon "wanted" to go attack the Clerics, but stayed where it
was, meleeing the tanks.  It's clear from Conquest's emails
and guild chat that they intended for the dragon to stay and
melee the tanks because, as in most raids, they were working
hard at keeping aggro ON the tanks.  Thus it was not considered
strange to them that the dragon kept beating on the tanks.
The question is, how were *they* to know what the dragon
was *thinking* of doing?  Only Verant has the data tools
necessary to examine the "brain" of the dragon and see that
what it "wanted" to do was different from what it *was* doing.
This sounds like evidence of a bug, for sure, but not an
exploit, since in order to be an exploit Conquest would
have had to have been able to "mind-read" the dragon and
know that they were making it behave contrary to its
actual "desires".  Conquest thought that the dragon kept
on the tank because they were constantly clearing the
Cleric's aggro (via CoH), they were apparently unaware
that there was some sort of other factor at work, coding-wise,
so it's not right for Verant to say "the dragon wanted to
move but didn't, so Conquest is guilty".
