I didn't like the book because it was boring, as dull as hell.
It didn't really make life that much harder with sterio sound I can
listen for andds etc. and the battle test etc. tells me what I need to
know, but my cleric never *saw* more than 5 seconds of a fight at one
time. That is just dull. It did not make it any harder to be a cleric,
it just made the whole game more frustrating and boring.

I can understand how it will make say an enchanter's life a bit easier
and perhaps a couple of the other casters, but my problem with the spell
book is that it meant that I (as a caster) missed out on content, not
that it made my job harder. 

I agree that removing the book sub 35 will make the game marginally
easier for some casters, but it will also make the game much less
frustrating and much more enjoyable for all casters. I know it's only my
opinion, but I think that the trade off is a good one.

(Not to mention the pain of spending $$$ on new video cards and RAM and
then not beging able to see any of the grafix for 50 - 90% of the time)

All IMOSHO,

Jim
