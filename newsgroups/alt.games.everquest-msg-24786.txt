Dan,

  No offense friend, but, please dont be led to believe that I'm going to
take everything suggested and mold my guild from the information given.  I'm
primarily trying to start a discussion about guilds overall.

  If I may request that you then participate in the discussion in such a way
as to not be vague or broad minded, I would greatly appreciate it.
Honestly, I felt the questions I asked were general questions, exactly as I
had intended.  I would like to think that Asag Order (in particular) is
not -my- guild, but instead a -members- guild.  I feel the community or
members oriented type guild within Xegony (just to name one from experience)
is lacking by far.  Sure, there are some that exist, however, with a bit of
input from myself and its members, hopefully Asag Order will become more
appealing than others.  Though, it isnt a popularity contest or by far a
battle for the better guild.  :)

  All in all, either, way I did enjoy your comments no matter how
unconstructive they were. ;)  As I mentioned I wasnt looking for absolute
answers to questions in hopes to use them as absolute guidelines of the
guild.  I'm simply trying to get an idea of what the mass (or a good part of
it) desires in a guild.  :)

  If you are in a guild and there are certain aspects of that guild that
appeal to you (regardless if you are leader or not), I would love to hear
what aspects/traits you like in particular or heck, even dislike.

Sincerely,
Jacobson
