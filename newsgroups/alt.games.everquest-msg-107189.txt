Personally, I enjoy participating in group /ooc conversations. The
only time I have a problem with it (and I have a BIG problem with it
then) is when it is something along the lines of "The Patriots are
OWNING the Dolphins today! PATS RULE!!!" or "Did anyone see Buffy
tonight?"

That is surely NOT what EQ /ooc is for, I don't care HOW you want to
interpret the PnP. Those people should hang out in IRC rooms.
