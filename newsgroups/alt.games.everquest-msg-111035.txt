It is a bit bizarre. I always thought that people twinked characters in 
order to be able to solo with them, particularly in the case of monks 
(sometimes I get the overwhelming urge to spend all my plat on TBoots for 
a twink Wizard, for example).

I think that the reason may be to be able to get into a higher-level 
group than they would otherwise, therefore getting xp a lot faster than 
they would in a level-appropriate group.
