When soloing, Harvest is basically a free half-bubble of mana every two
or three fights.  Nice, but basically it's like having Breeze.  Breeze
thrilled me at level 30.  Breeze does not thrill me at level 50.

One place Harvest does really shine is when I'm travelling, or going to
town to sell and bank and stock up on food and drink.  I can get one or
two Harvests in while doing that, so when I'm ready to gate back to
where I'm fighting, I'm at FM.

Hell, Druids can gain mana while fighting.  Root and DOT, and then med
while the DOT does its thing.  If a Wizard needs mana during a fight, we
can try rooting and then medding, but that doesn't work as well as it
does for Druids, because our root is less reliable.  Against Wizard
root, the mob gets a chance to break root every tick.  Against higher
level Druid root, they get a check at 1 tick, then the checks are every
5 ticks.  So, Druid roots last longer than Wizard roots.  Combine that
with Druid snare, which lasts a freaking 10 *MINUTES* (compared to ours,
which is a little over 2 minutes) and takes much less mana than ours,
and Druids have it great.
