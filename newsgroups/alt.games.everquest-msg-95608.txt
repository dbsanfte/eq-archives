IIRC, the amount of experience required to gain one alternate advancement
level is the same as the amount of experience it takes a character to level
from 51 to 52.   This amount does not change.

A character who has alternate advancement on 50 / 50 at level 51 should see
the bars moving at about the same rate.     A character who has alternate
advancement on 50/50 at 59 will see the alt bar screaming across while the
main bar crawls.   A level 60 who has it on 50/50 sees the alt bar moving
slightly faster.

(note, this is what was originally stated.   Since then they have posted that
they nerfed alt advancement gaining rates since people were going too fast.
I don't know what it is now, perhaps a level 52 or 53 for each alt level...
but it works the same way.)


Based on my own experiments, at 60, 60% to normal and 40% to alt makes the two
bars move at the same rate.
