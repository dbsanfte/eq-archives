Took me two tries to read the Gap series. I read the first book, and
didn't Get It. Some months later, with the others in hand (and knowing
that Donaldson was an excellent writer, I made the correct assumption
that the problem was with me, not the books), I tried again. That's
when I realized that the entire first book is just a Prelude to the
actual story.

It all made sense then, and yes, was an excellent if harsh read.
