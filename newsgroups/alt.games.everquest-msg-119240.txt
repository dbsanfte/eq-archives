In the past I've grouped with monks a -lot- but monks who
already knew what they were doing.  My main EQ buddy
now has a monk alt up to 28 and I have a bard alt at
27, finally both at levels close enough to group effectively...


At any rate, we found a nice "sweet spot" to camp, doing
cyclops in Rathe Mountains, where we are killing light
red mobs on a fairly regular basis, which is always the
way I like it... the blue kill thing gets real old after a while.

Funny thing is, though, Feign Death simply doesn't work
on the "a cyclops" mobs.  Not at all.  I'm not talking a skill
fail, that gives the "fallen to the ground" message... no, she
repeatedly, successfully FD'd, and kept aggro solidly, to the
extent that my pathetic bardly banging away wasn't enough
to get the love.  On more than one 'clops, cause we tried it
a few more times to be sure.

We petitioned this occurrance, and a guide got back to her
to say that there are some mobs that see thru monkly tricks,
basically "broken as intended"

The 'clops were still a great way to spend an evening, but it
would have been nice to have a way of ditching her aggro to
me to spread out the damage.

Is there a list somewhere of mobs that -can't- be FD'd?
