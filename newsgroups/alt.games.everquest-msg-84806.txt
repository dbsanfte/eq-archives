On the other hand, a BL pet is always buffed to the same level by the
level buff spell.

The BL 15 level buff spell buffs the warder to 16 *always*, the level
16 mage summoning spell summons an elemental with a level range of
13-17 (IIRC).  As you go up in levels, the lowest pet you summon is
the same level as the highest level pet from the previous rank.
