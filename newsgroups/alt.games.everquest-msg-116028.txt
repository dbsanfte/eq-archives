Nah, I have infinite patience with true newbies, even after 2 plus yrs. 
playing and multiple 50+ characters. Last night, I'm sitting, anon on, 
on a rooftop in FP seriously engaged in a guildmeeting gone truly nasty 
and I hear, "Hail, M----." I think, "If this guy who has managed to find 
me in this hidey hole I'm interrupts me with "sow plz" I swear I will 
f*)$ing kill him." Instead he said he was new to the game and asked 
actual questions; none of this "ne stuf i can have d00d?" or "gimme 
plat?" crap, but reasonable, intelligent questions in complete 
sentences, with punctuation and everything! I got so excited I actually 
got a bit disengaged in "As the Guild Turns", answered some basic "How 
do I do this?" stuff for him, buffed him up with everything a high level 
druid can offer, led him to the gate, and told him what to kill. Real 
newbies are a blast! It's the pseudo-newbie begger d00d types that start 
to grind on your nerves after a bit. =P

Mey <=isn't jaded about *real* innocence/inexperience at all, even after 
54 levels as a druid =)
