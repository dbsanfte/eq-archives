When you changed the skill window's width and height, did you put in a
purely arbitrary number?

When I did mine (afaicr) I put in the same numbers for width and
height that I got from a character whose skill table was working. I
don't recall everything getting reset (though to be truthful, it was a
fairly new character... lvl 4, at the time and I was using a custom
UI).

I guess at the possibility that if you put in a number other than 300
for the width of the skill window (especially one smaller than 300)
that it no longer "fit" [maybe a skill window definition] so EQ
reinitialized the character's INI files, to remove the 'bad INI
files', which would have wiped all your customizations. Obviously, the
height of the table can be almost anything.

If you look at the ASCII patch, the width of the skill table is 300
(pixels? probably) regardless of screen resolution, while the height
could be different. I think the default window width/height is
300/240.
