Drop rate appears unchanged, collects are still iffy, have been for some 
time.  SOmetimes they go great, sometimes they suck.

Pacify was fixed to last the duration stated on the spell, and seemed to be

that the pacifiers had gotten used to it lasting 5 minutes, rather than 48 
seconds it should have lasted.
