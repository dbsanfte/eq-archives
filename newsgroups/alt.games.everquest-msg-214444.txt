It seems to me you used to be able to do that in the game, from the first 
screen where the top option is connect.  Isn't one of the other options 
account?  I could be remembering wrong, it might be the next screen.  But 
you should be able to do it from the game software if you're using the US 
version.  If you are an Ubisoft customer or using a non english language 
copy of the game the rules are different, or so I've been told.
