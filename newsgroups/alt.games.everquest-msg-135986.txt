Can't wear black when it makes me look like a dominatrix to untinted
Luclinites, you know. *sigh* Was such a bummer when that was patched.
I love black.

What hat is it? And what graphic does it have on cleric/monk?

I've decided that I will deign to wear leather pants again, if they
are woven grass.

*snicker* At least the stuff still looks good when I have old models
turned on. And when I have new models on, too, since skintinting
doesn't suit my graphics card. But, just knowing how I looked to
others was enough to ditch it.
 I think I looked particularly bad because my Luclin hair was a white
ponytail when I wore gnomeskin - the hairstyle enhanced the dominatrix
effect of the patched black leather.
