And if I am not mistaken that does Say "Zone Alarm Pro".  He was nice enough
to make that clear.  Next time You want to Flame why don't you take your
head out of your ass long enough to read the thread from the begining.
After that you can shove your head  right back up there.   As for my
information about the diferences about the US and UK 'Gold Editions" the
info was right on.  I would hate to see that person scamed on some sight
that just list's it as gold and "has all the expansions" just to find out in
the small print at the bottom of the page it says..  All expansions
available prior to October 2002.  I have seen these scams on ebay as of
late.

Don't bother with a retaliatory post.  I normaly don't bother with narrow
minded peons like you but I had to set this straight as I was the one that
was correct.


To you Mr. Willson, you may want to see a proctologist and see what he can
do about that growth.
To everyone else have a good day.
