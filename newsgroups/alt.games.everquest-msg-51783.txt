The soloing caster classes would be the easiest of all. Namely necro and
druid.
I know that for my necro and druid, losing my equipment woudnt really hurt
my potential to level or make money. I still have all my spells, and can go
out and solo/farm exactly as I have always done (minus the es vambraces, and
a bit or mana pool I guess).

Would be tough if you lost your spells as well. I guess youd have to go farm
bronze weapons, as a warrior would.
