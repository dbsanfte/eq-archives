Debbie Denise
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

She kept the light open, all night long
For me to come home, and sing her my song
Oh Debbie Denise was true to me
She'd wait by the window, so patiently
And I'd come on home with my hair hanging down
She'd pin it up, and softly smile

But I was out rolling with my band
And I was out rolling with my band

I never realized, she was so undone
I didn't suspect she had no life of her own
She was so true but she was a she
She was just there I would just come
Stumbling in she'd show me she'd care
I didn't care cause she was just there

But I was out rolling with my band
And I was out rolling with my band

I wouldn't come home for weeks at a time
She wouldn't accept that she was free
Oh Debbie Denise was true to me
She'd wait by the window so bitterly

Wanting me to come close, I guess I noticed
I couldn't see, so what could I say
That more affection could I show her
I had only one thing on my mind

When I come to her, she'd pin back my hair
And out past the fields out the window I'd stare

Where I was out rolling with my band
I was out rolling with my band
