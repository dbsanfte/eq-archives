I went to fiona vie and rolled up a new hum wiz. there were 3-4 other 
people here just outside the west gate of freeport. so it looks like it 
may be more promising. if there are that many people around this time of 
the day, i maye be able to find a group to join.

i keep forgetting to give my note to the guildmaster (or keep screwing 
it up), so i haven't got a robe this time either :)

thanks
