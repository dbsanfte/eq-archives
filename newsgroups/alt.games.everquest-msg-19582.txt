Sometimes there is no expectation or reciprocation. If I am running
somewhere and overtake someone, I terget them, get far enough ahead (a
skill that was a bit hard to develop) to cast SoW on them before they
get out of range.  Then I recast Camo and move on. 
I did have one enchanter who I sow'd at the FP docks as I got off the
boat (pre-19) catch up to me in Oasis docks and breeze me in thanks.
So I offered to levitate and guide her to the teleport room in
Timorous (she said she was headed to Odus for something, faster to
teleport into Erudin than running and trying to find a port)
