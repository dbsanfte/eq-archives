I was able to slow the various Underbulks and Lightcrawlers in PoD with only
an occasional resist.  Most of them were tashed prior to me casting, and
they varied in level from dark blue to yellow to me at 56.  I did not debuff
many of them, as it did not seem necessary, and the debuff seemed to get
resisted more than my slow anyway.  I did toss some cold based nukes, and
had a few partial resists, and a couple of complete resists, but mostly they
landed for full damage.  I have not tried soloing anything in there yet, but
am thinking of heading back to try.  The xp there was great, even with 10
people, using /raid.  We were not fighting anywhere near the graveyard, we
were quite a ways off from there, but I had no trouble running to join the
people already there with invis up.
