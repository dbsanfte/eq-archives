I'm looking for a place to hunt with my 42 shaman.  I need a place with good
exp and decent loot.  Also, I am very tired of DL, OT, RM.  What do you guys
(and girls) suggest as my new hunting grounds and why do you suggest it?  I
have all current expansions and am willing to travel wherever need be.
