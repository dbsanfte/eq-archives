As I understand it the damage bonus is only added onto the amount of 
damage your weapon does after the swing - ie after your STR and weapon 
skills etc are factored into the equation. Thus a damage bonus value 
cannot simply be added to the damage value of the weapon. This means the 
damage bonus is actually much less than what it would be if it was 
simply added onto the damage value of the weapon.
