Because if god had the ability to change the course of things and
ignored her based on what you said he'd be the devil, not a god.

What's whit this "why does a prayer have to be a request" stuff that
keeps popping up every few posts. It's pretty simple: If it does not
ask god for help, in any way whatsoever, then it's not really a
prayer, but merely meditation. Let this sink in for a moment before
you flame me for it.
