I have some kind of Intel chipset on my laptop.  My targeting ring still
doesn't work - I guess that was too much to hope for.  The Find does work,
but it's terrible compared to what it used to be on my computer.  Now it's a
bunch of barely visible sparklers.  This was something I really didn't think
needed to be worked on.
