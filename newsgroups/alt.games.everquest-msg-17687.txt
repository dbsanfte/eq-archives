heh ... one of my boys gets really squirrelly with any sugar at all (more
than most kids ... sugar turns him into David Lee Roth).  My mom didn't
believe me on this until one day about three years ago when she was
babysitting for us over a weekend.  My son was two at the time.

Before we were out the door, she had handed him a couple of Oreos. "You two
are just being over-protective new parents", she said.  "You lived off of
Oreos when your were his age.".

When we called at 10:00 that night to let her know we had arrived at our
destination, he hadn't napped and was still awake ... *wide* awake ... and
we could hear him laughing and giggling in the background.  Mom sounded
rather harried.  "I've never seen anything like this", was her first
comment.

Since then, she asks before giving him anything with large doses of sugar.
