	I ended up going to Legends myself -- I created a level 1 Ranger on my
server, twinked him up and sent him over.

	Just cancelled the service a few days ago.

	I never saw any dynamic content the entire time I played (just over a
month.)  I did see the GMs put out a call for a Nagafen raid once, but there
was no "story" to it.  Granted I was a newb on a server littered with L60s.
But from what I was seeing on various web boards, the L60s weren't seeing a
whole lot of dynamic content, either.

	The web content is broken too; doesn't update nearly often enough and
doesn't work with all browsers.  It seems to be most compatable with IE but
even that doesn't work 100% all the time.

	The CS was great.  Once, the server crashed while I was online, and it was
back up in five minutes with GMs all over the place ressing anyone who died
because of the outage.

	I can't recommend the Legends service.  It needs a lot of work.  And they
really, really need to treat Legends as a "special rules" server, no character
transfers to or from.
