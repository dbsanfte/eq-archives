How?  Why?  I solo a fair amount myself, and this spell line would suit
me fine if it was worth a warm bucket of otter spit.. but its so busted now
that its a waste of my time to even try... unless its been fixed in the past
6 months or so since I last cast anything from the line.

Here's how it used to work:  Single target aggro range reducer, sort of a
harmony junior.  Slap this on a mob, and you can pull his sister standing
five feet away right out from under him and off you go on a date.

Trouble is, it fails more often than it sticks.

Other trouble is, when it fails, it aggros the target.

So I now have two (or more) angry mobs headed my way, and I wouldn't
have been using the spell if I didn't want just one.

If it failed more like one time in six, then I'd happily accept the aggro
thing.
Thems the breaks, fine by me.

If it didn't aggro, like Harmony doesn't, then I'd happily accept the 50+%
fail rate.

But with -both- conditions in play, I'm better off pulling the same stunt with

root/atone, or with blind, or with cancel magic, or with Mark of Karn, or with

Fear, or... well I dunno, just nuking and accepting the fact that I'm going to
get
both mobs.

Harmony is a mass lull that usually sticks and doesn't aggro if it fails.
Lull line
is -none- of those things!

I'll eagerly pick up Wake of Tranquility from the guild vault if anyone hints
that
the spell is any better than my past experiences indicate
