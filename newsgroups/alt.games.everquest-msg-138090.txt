Halfling Paladin

Weapons:
2HS Axe/Magic Item 16/37

1HS Bersekers Sword 12/36 Magic/Lore
(equipped with Cracked Darkwood Shield AC12/STR9)

Skill in 1HS is 90
2HS 7 (never used)

With 1HS my ATK # is near 400, it drops to 180 with my 2HS enabled.

Questions: (not being familar with ATK/attack/dmg calculations)

1 - Right now the 2HS hits for only a couple more points (28-30) than 1HS
(usually 26-28). Obviously 1HS hits way more frequently however since my 2HS
skill is so low. Will the dmg done increase as the skill increases, or is
that a function of level? Otherwise I would stick with 1HS and use Bash for
9-10 more points.

Suggestions/preferences for 2HSv1HS? I thought 2HS might be better for some
reason but I could be wrong.
