I googled for the answer to this question, and I think I found the answer,
but I want to be sure before I fook anything up.

I just bought EQ Gold yesterday. I have been playing for the last month on
my work comp, as I don't have a comp at home right now (C'mon Xmas!). If I
install the expansions on my work comp, will I ever be able to install the
game on my eventual new comp at home, using the same account key? I would
hate to install it here at work, only to be pissed when I can't play at home
after Xmas.

Thanks in advance for the help!

Geoff
