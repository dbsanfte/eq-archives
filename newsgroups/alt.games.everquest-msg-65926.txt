Does the /channel <channel name> command work as advertised? I don't
like having my chat box cluttered with dozens of messages I don't wish
to see (especially auctions) so I toggle channels on and off as needed.
However, if I type, for example

/channel shout

it doesn't toggle the channel like the manual supplement says it should.
Am I doing something incorrectly? It's a real pain to have to go into
the options to change the setting, especially when you are in full
screen mode and don't have access to the options button.

I don't want this anger that's burning in me.
It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
