OK, so I had a bad experience with someone 
using the word way too much and they 
didn't know what it meant so te context was  . . .
very sad. Very very sad.

So then I saw a thread in the EQ group where someone
else used Livid way out of conext and I had to rant.

I love conversations like this, they are great fun.
