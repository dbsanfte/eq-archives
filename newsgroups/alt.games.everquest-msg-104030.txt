laugh hate to say this but 19 is still young... I personally didn't start
questing and having more fun than exp groups until I hit about 40 (Save a
couple small quests like Stein of Moggok)

as an enchanter life until 29 was tough... at 29 I got clarity which made
life REALLY much better... before that was like you said... fight fight
ding... fight die cr... fight fight fight... heh... Lot of the good quests
are only safe when ya get 40+ and good ones aren't safe even then...
everquest isn't just about numbers (Level, str, int etc) it's about getting
together with ppl you know and like and doing fun stuff... hate to sound
like a 'poster child' but that's what I enjoy about the game... I'm now 52
enchanter DYING to get 54 (repeately dying but that's the life of a chanter
/snicker) but what makes the game is getting to 54... I'm getting to try out
so many new dungeons now that I'm 50+ and get to meet so many different
ppl... not to mention the ppl I already know from my guild :)

Just me rambling.. have to run... peace
