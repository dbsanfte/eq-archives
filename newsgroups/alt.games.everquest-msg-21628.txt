I play a Half-Elf Bard. I chose the race based on a roleplay.

In my mind Half-Elves are not accepted by either parent race. I feel
that the Elves and Humans would look down upon any "half-blood". Being
an outcast means that I am forced to travel. I never feel welcome in
any Human or Elf town. As I travel I pick up stories, and put them to
song. I then use my gift of song to "entertain" friend and foe :-).

(My next project is going to be a Ranger, He will be Half-Elf as well
for the same reasons)

Cheers
