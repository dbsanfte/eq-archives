Umm, yes, there are mobs that are faster than T/JBoots, faster than SOW,
heck, faster than just about anything but a decent level bard with a good
drum.  Few and far between.  Theres also being encumbered, and snared, and
desperately injured that may make you slower than some mobs even with the
boots effect on.

But what I meant by "always being faster" in this case was that you never
run out of potions or charges, the boots can always be clicked again to keep
the effect going.

Sorry for the confusion.
