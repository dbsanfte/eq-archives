I have. I've paid taxes through the nose in all the years I've lived in 
the USA, and I don't resent a cent of it. You have benefitted from that 
money, the same way I've benefitted from the taxes you have paid. And 
since I've paid the taxes that sustain the infrastructure that allows *
you* to earn a salary, then you *owe* me and the rest of the country to 
pay your taxes, so *we* can continue earning our salaries too.
