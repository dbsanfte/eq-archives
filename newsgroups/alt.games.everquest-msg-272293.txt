In Alchemy, it depends which skills you use.  In scribing, I can 
currently actually end up with full power while creating an item, as one 
of the skills does a pretty decent power gain in exchange for a loss of 
either durability or progress, I couple that with one that increases 
durability or progress, and still end up with a net gain in power in 
exchange for reducing my gain in finishing the item.
