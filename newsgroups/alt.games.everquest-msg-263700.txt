Does that mean you would buy EQ to only be able to create a character and
have no quests until an expansion ?
errr module comes out ?
Or have only zones to fight in to level 5 until an expansion comes out ?

I wouldn't. Having an unfinished game and having a 10 year business plan for
the game and having a modular game and having expansions for the games are
all different..

The OP was saying the game wasnt done. The response was saying apps use 10
year modular plans.
I dont think a basic feature such as having quests in everquest is excusable
by saying the game is modular was one of my points
