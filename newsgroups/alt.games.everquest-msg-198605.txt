Thanks for the tips guys.  I was always rather concerned about the EQ key if
the day ever came that I had to reformat.  The first time I bought EQ, I
couldn't register an account because it said that the CD key was already
identified with someone else...something like that.  So I had to take it
back to the store and convince them that they needed to let me exchange it
for another one.  I don't really think they understood my delimma, and since
then I've always been rather tense when entering the keys for the
expansions.  I guess I have cdkeyaphobia.  Anyway, thanks.

Gordon
