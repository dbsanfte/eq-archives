You can ask another character who can cast invisibility to help you. This is
what you do:
    Put red wines in the trade window, but don't click on trade button yet.
    Ask another person to invis you.
    Once your invisible, click on trade.
    Repeat until your faction is indifferent.

It took me little about 2 stacks of red wines to get from apprehensive to
indifferent, and then less than a stack to get to amiable.
