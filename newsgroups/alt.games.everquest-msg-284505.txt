Sure but the point is, what is the cost and benefit of each one
pulling?  If a monk leaves, you definitely lose his considerable DPS.
If a bard leaves, you may lose considerable buffs.  (Depends on whether
is buffs are worth much)

On Combine, this is only true if there is neither a shaman or enchanter
in the group.

The monk may have been 50% or more of your DPS.  Assuming there are no
other haste buffers in the group, what is better: a monk and a warrior
with less haste or a bard and a warrior with more haste?

This is getting to be a very unique situation.  Your group has no
enchanter and no shaman.  Your group has mana problems (in many or most
groups, mana is just never a problem unless you overpull).  Your group
has lots of melee to justify the bard's haste over the monk's natural
DPS, with our without haste.  And finally, the bard is usually keeping
at least 4 songs going.

The thing is I rarely see a bard singing mana or HP regen songs unless
we are just sitting there.

If you are playing your bard well, you are pacing the mobs while the
group is killing the last one.  But even if your bard absolutely sucks,
waiting until the last mob is dead to even leave for the next, pacing
and pulling is still far faster than FD splitting.

As far as I can tell, the only way to determine the level is to have
various people /con it.  The spell info does indicate a number which
could be tied to the pet level, although those numbers are a bit off at
least after 60.  The 61 necro pet is called skel_pet_61 and I know for
a fact he wasn't a white con when my Necro was 61.

This is how you can single pull a Chardok noble, after all.  Although
without sight graft or a dual-box setup, it may be nearly impossible as
an SK.

Oh I guess that wasn't clear.  Yes, with dooming they will just stand
there.

If you are feigned while he paths through, no agro, ever.  Direct,
indirect, whatever.  This was one trick I used on my necro when fear
kiting.  If he was gong to path through an add while feared, I just
feigned.  The danger is that when you eventually stand up, he is still
out there with direct agro and then he begins generating the adds.

Good point.  We occaisionally load up a few groups (on a regular
server) to slaughter everything in the zone for cleric fragments and
typically I will just volunteer to solo all the chromos I can find so
that the entire "raid" is not dispelled.  At 70 with reasonable gear,
buffs are pretty unimportant.  Of course my Dark Cloak of the Sky
helps.  :)

I believe that most of the improvements in fletching will just give you
higher damage arrows, which is pretty pointless.  However despite the
fact that I personally skilled fletching up to 260 or so, I never paid
much attention to what skill level you need in order to fletch the
longest flight arrows.  Once I had endless quiver, I just cared about
the highest damage arrow, not the range.  I would assume that at 150,
you can make a low damage arrow that will fly about as far as any other
arrow but I don't know for sure.
