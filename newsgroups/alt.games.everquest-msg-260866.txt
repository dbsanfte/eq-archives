It's not the point of 50pp I'm glad to give it to the people not saying it
has to be that amount or more.  What the cleric in question doesn't realize
is by placing a set amount she is hurting herself cause people will rarely
give more than that amount.  I couldn't care less if it's fully extended or
not.  As that is her reasoning, that and it "took skill to get to the level
and get the AA's".  And she badmouths clerics who just got the spell saying
" if you want Quality come to me, not from someone who just got the spell".

She is very high on herself and spends 90% of her gaming time (ie all day
and most of night) Peddling herself in PoK.  So I would rather go without
then get the buff from someone as rude as her.  People have gotten to the
point of saying 50pp for Virtue from anyone but the cleric in question.
Those of you on TT will know exactly who I"m talking about.
