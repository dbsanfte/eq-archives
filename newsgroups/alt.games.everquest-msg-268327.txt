I would have to agree, at least in part.  And I still plan on playing EQ for
a while yet, so this is opinion from that side of the fence.  Every "high
end" guild on my server is having turmoil of some sort.  People that compare
the current situation to DAoC or SWG or even CoH (the biggest prior hits to
EQ) aren't paying attention.  Sure, I expect some people to come back
eventually, but I've tried both WoW and EQ2 (as well as DAoC, SWG, and CoH
at their respective times).  As you say, "better in *enough* ways for
*enough* people."  I'd personally be surprised if enough people came back to
counteract the people filtering out (for WoW/EQ2/real life, etc.).

Without a doubt, there will be consolidation where necessary.  When
consolidation is no longer enough, SOE changes the way the game operates
(the fact that they've already started down that path gives us a glimpse of
the kind of numbers *they* are seeing).  When even that is no longer enough,
server mergers, though I feel that is in a far distant future yet.
