I suggest a Charred Guardian Shield +9 Wis and good ac...  They sell for
150-400 pp depending on where/when you are and if you can find a NON greedy
person who isnt only out to make a buck (dont know about your server but
that is rare on mine) .  I saw one guy wanted 700 for it.  I just laughed at
him and went on my way.

I was lucky...  A higher level guildie got me one the old fashioned way...
He got it when it dropped from a Mobs bloody corpse.  :)
