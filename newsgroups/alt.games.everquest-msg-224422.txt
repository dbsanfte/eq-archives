   Yes, it is easier for us healer types in these sort of situations.  But it
isn't right to expect the cleric sitting next to you to jump in with a heal
either, imho.  For one thing, they might be oom.  For another, there might be
faction issues to deal with.  Also, us healers run the risk of getting burned
out by others treating our mana as theirs.  Many many many times I've had melee
types that I don't know run up to me with the dreaded "Heal plz".  Might as well
be saying "Powerlevel me, now!".  Of course, there are the usual didn't see the
message in the battle spam, being afk, or watching "Stargate" at the second you
called for help reasons that might lead to someone not jumping in.  

   Sure, it's great when someone jumps in and saves someone's ass.  I've had
many come to my aid, and I've tossed off my fair share of Kindness Heals.  But
the other person is paying the same amount of money you are to play.  They are
not Sony employees (almost always), they don't get a paycheck to stand around
and pull your chestnuts out of the fire.  They are under no obligation at all,
ever, to play guard to you.  And it is rude to get mad at them when they choose
not to.
