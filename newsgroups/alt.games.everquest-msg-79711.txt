Hrmm.  I'm not sure what you're trying to say.   Historically, a bow
is far more dangerous than a sword, assuming you can pick your
fights.   A sword against a plate-armored opponent is used mostly
for beating your opponent senseless, something EQ models pretty
well against all mobs.   You either beat your opponent to death or
get lucky and get an unarmored gap and a killing (critical) strike.

A bow - like the English (Welsh, actually) longbow -- on the other
hand is a "one-shot, you're dead unless I'm unlucky, in which case
I'll get five shots before you get anywhere close to me and you're
certainly dead before then" weapon.   The English longbow -- 6ft or
longer, 120lb draw or more -- was capable of firing arrows historically
which penetrated plate armor at a range of 80 yards.

In fact the longbow and its widespread deployment among the English
pretty much ended the "Age of Knights."   An army of 7000 archers
like at Crecy supported by lesser numbers of infantry and mounted
knights could defeat vastly numerically superior armies of mounted
knights with little loss.

Let's put it this way, ignoring that warriors also get archery as a skill:

Based on historical models, in a duel, with both opponents entering
a PvP arena from opposite ends, a 60 warrior would lose -- virtually
every time -- to a 20 ranger if you used historical models.   The ranger
would get probably five or more shots at killing range -- that's at range
where the arrowhead penetrates steel sufficiently to kill -- before the
warrior would get close enough to swing his sword *once.*   Since a
20th ranger should be a master archer, he's just not going to miss
five (or more) times....

So, no, arrows shouldn't do damage like a sword.  They're vastly better
than that, historically.   But EQ has to downgrade (or ignore) their
historical abilities because it wouldn't be much of a game otherwise.
