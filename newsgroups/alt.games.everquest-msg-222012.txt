Everyone's 'job' in LDoN is to kill things as quickly and effiiciently
as possible. A warrior taunting for 10 seconds before every mez break
just isn't gonna cut it. 

A good example of why I find it just not worth the hassle to take an
enchanter on a normal LDoN run. Give me 2 or 3 people that can
off-tank and not having mez or pacify pulling just isn't a problem.
