Thanks for this!  Not only does it make me feel less screwed but it
was educational.  I generally just play the game and enjoy it, I
rarely work at figuring out things like this.  I realize it's basic
algebra but I prefer to spend my "game time" actually in the game
since the rest of my time is dedicated to life.  Sometimes that's good
and sometimes it's not....

Thanks again.
