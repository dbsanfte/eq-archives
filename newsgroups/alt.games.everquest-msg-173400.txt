It's been a new bow and a bunch of new AA since I last had a parse of myself but...

A month or so ago, me and few guildmates had our play times match for a week and
we spent about 4 hours a night in Honour at the same spot grinding experience.  The
Rogue in the group was running EQ companion on her laptop parsing all our results.

Halls of Honour, killing the Valorian Guards in the Hero Shrines (at least we call them
Hero Shrines on Druzzil Ro).

Level 65 Ranger, 240 archery, Eagle Eye buff up, Primal Bow (33/35), EQ with
blessed mithiral champ arrows (11 + 4 fire), AM3, Combat Fury 3, Swiftwind and
Swift Like the Wind for haste, 1690 attack, and no nuke spell damage in the parses:

Huge range of DPS, from about 120 to 220, (depending how buggy archery decided to
be on that mob) with an average sitting in the area of 160 to 170 DPS.  The two Trueshots
that were parsed during that week that I can remember came out to be 252 and 302 dps.

The Rogue by comparision ( level 65, maxed offense skills, Khalshazar in mainhand,
Rage Bringer in secondary, Combat Fury 3) averaged 190 to 200 DPS.
