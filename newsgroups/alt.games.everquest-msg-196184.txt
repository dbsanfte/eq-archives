Ok after reading the responces to this I have decided no matter how I
say it you wont care so this is for everyone else.

ShowEq kept Sony honest.

Thats it, this "stop the cheaters campain" only got started when SoE
got tired of having its lies and misdirections published in black and
white for the gaming public to see. Can think of no less than 3
instances where if not for showeq we would never have gotten them to
correct the errors, and Im being generous with the word "errors".
Since ShowEq was nerfed they have gone back to telling us one thing
and doing another. Can I prove it? Nope no ShowEq to nail em so it
will continue. Can you prove they dropped the ZEM in the tier 1 PoP
zones after the top guilds moved on? Nope, why? No showeq. Can you
prove the ZEM has changed for a host of other zones to "enhance" sales
of expansions? Nope and you know why. See we know this has happened we
just cant prove it, a year ago we could have.

Now as for cheating or even cracking (lol) , well sony sends out
packets on a public network. I can legaly do any passive action I wish
to these packets. As long as I dont use the information to commit a
crime theres nothing that can be done. It was a problem on PvP servers
but again Sony decided what to transmit not us.

No need for a long discussion, you think its cheating , I think the
cheater is Sony. Certainly Sony's errr "errors" affect far more people
than ShowEq ever could have. 

It was fun it was informative and I miss it.
