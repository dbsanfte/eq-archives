OMG!  ROFLMAO!

I almost forgot my wife's first try at a Human Ranger in Qeynos/Surefall.

She was cursing that damn little candle and the tunnel and I had to keep
running the "blind" character in and out of the tunnel for her by "feel" as
she couldn't make it herself.
She was so happy when my barb shammy made 5th and I braved Black
Burrow to run her and some other newbies down some lanterns.
:-)

I Love this game!
