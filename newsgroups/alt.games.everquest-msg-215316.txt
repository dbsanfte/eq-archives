There's a Cabilis West vendor named Jondin (loc n28, p512) who sells chipped
bone rods as well as all the usual potions. He's on that island in the canal
north of The Gauntlet (pvp area) and west of the Cabilis East zone line. He's
in a tent with another scaly vendor whose name I didn't bother to write down.
They are both have the "(Alchemy Merchant)" tag.

Ick. I just finished the Greenmist quest for my dark elf shadowknight.  He
leveled from 33 to 35 on all the roamers in the area you sorta need to
clear if you want the raiders to pop with any frequency. Only took me a
week of camping to get the last piece (the binder), which of course is no
drop. Oh yeah, there's a quest you can do to get the binder, but it's
been broken for years. It's not called the Test of Pain for nothing!
