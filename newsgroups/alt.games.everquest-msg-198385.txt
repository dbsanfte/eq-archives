    Do you have the cash, and the time, to play around a little?

    Have a cleric without Unfailing Divinity go to the old world, DI
themselves, and Manastone down. DI triggers at like 15% health, so they'll
know before they die whether to CH up and try again or not. Repeat as many
times as they can before they go broke or get tired, with as high a CHA as
the cleric can achieve. A pair of Opal Encrusted Steins adds 50 CHA, and if
the cleric has a Grandmaster's Anything they can range slot it for another
50 CHA, so they should be able to get quite high.

    You might be surprised at the results.

    James
