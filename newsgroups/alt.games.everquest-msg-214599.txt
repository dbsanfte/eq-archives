I have never had any trouble finding a cleric or paladin willing to rez 
me.  I always offer to pay for the rez, and, more often than not, am 
turned down on that.  Of course, at level 65, the death penalty is not 
terribly meaningful, unless I take several.  After I die, I put 10% xp 
back in to regular until I have a comfortable buffer again.  I've taken 
two unrezzed deaths so far at 65, just because I didn't feel like dealing 
with the downtime.
