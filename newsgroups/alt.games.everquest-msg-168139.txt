Eons ago, pre Kelethin lift levers, I tried using a dual stike? gamepad /
joystick combo thing. I hate mice and never used a WASD setup before so was
trying to get better at circle strafing my rogue. It worked but more
difficult than keyboard to use.

The game is really a keyboard one. I don't see any gamepad working well.
