I'm almost certain this was not the case...   A group heal isn't an AE spell
as such.   It affects your group only, not any mobs or other groups in your
area.   A MGB'ed group heal.... maybe?  The boxes might be coded such that
any spell hitting them, even one not marked as detrimental, will set them
off.   But I see no way a group heal could have hit it.
