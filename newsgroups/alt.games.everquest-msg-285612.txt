Oh, I've had a couple of characters to 60 already in WoW.  I'm not into
raiding there, and the last 18months have been incredibly dry for non-
raid content.  However, I've been in the TBC beta and it is amazing. Add
to that the revamped honor system and arenas and the amount of non-raid,
max level content is way beyond what we had since Dire Maul came out. 

And really, what do you do at max level in EQ?  Grind AA's and raid and
do the new instanced stuff (LDoN, DoN and whatever came after it - I left
at that godawful DX9 patch and don't know them well).

In TBC you do heroic mode instances, raids, Battlegrounds, world-pvp and
arena PvP, maybe a bit of faction grinding mixed in (I definitely want
exalted with HH - too many nice things to pick up).
