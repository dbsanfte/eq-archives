Oh yeah, most definitely. He's still blue to me, and that's the way I like
it, uh huh uh huh. ;) He kicks butt for the most part. What I've been doing,
after I noticed that pet wasn't hitting them, was not summoning pet and just
taking them myself, tashan, enfeeble, choke choke choke, beat beat beat.
Wash rinse repeat. Works ok so long as there's only 1. Pet does pretty good
on scarabs and young kodiaks though!
