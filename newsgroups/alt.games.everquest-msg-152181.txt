Well, given my recent habit of sticking up for trolls, I thought I should 
point out that the 'e' is not extraneous.  'Importante' is, in fact, the 
proper Portugese spelling for the word meaning important.

I briefly thought that might explain the incomprehensbilty of the rest of 
his post, but babelfish readily disabused me of that notion.  It's surely 
a simple lack of grasp of proper English spelling.  Our esteemed foreign 
scrivener should be made aware that the second person pronoun 
(equivalent to 'voce') is spelled 'you', and not 'u'.  Similarly, the 
second person form of 'to be' ('e' in Portugese) is 'are', and not 'r'.

Using these proper spelings will greatly enhance your ability to 
communicate with native English or American speakers.  Of course, it's 
also possible that you have somehow mistaken Usenet for a wireless phone, 
and are worried about your posts exceeding a certain character count.  
This is not the case.  Your posts may be of any length, and certainly long 
enough to include the extra characters.  Similarly, you may have mistaken 
it for a real-time chat medium, and feel pressured to type your post 
hurriedly.  It's not, feel free to take your time and compose a coherent 
post.
