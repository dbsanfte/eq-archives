You sir obviously do not have children. It is NOT being overly protective to
keep a child from getting emotionally worked up over a LIESURE activity!

My child also wants to play EQ, and even wanted to play on VZ where I play.
I stomped on that immediately. When and if he plays ( he may be to young for
it now anyways ) it WILL be on a bluebie server. Children, for the most
part, dont have the ability to disconnect what happens to them in-game from
reality. A slight, or hurt in-game is just as real to them as a real life
hurt. Why should the OP allow his child to be subjectred to such things in
his play time ? There are PLENTY of RL instances that will teach him the
"School of Hard Knocks". Play time for children is a time to relax, and
enjoy being children.

 The OP who protected his child was, in my opinion, absolutely correct.
