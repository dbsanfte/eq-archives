i got to play Eq very little compared to normal today but the couple hours i
was on were the best ever.
i log on and there i sit on the wizard spire in Nek forest, im hoping to
complete the last 1 part of my staff of wheel quest. the only part remaining
is the everfrost part since its the only one i didnt have an exact loc on. i
didnt have any spells memed as i had died last i was on, so i was meming my
Nk port spell to head off to Everfrost while doing so a person ports in, a
higher level wizard, he asks to inspect me i sau sure whatever. we get to
talking and he is also doing his wheel staff and his last part is ALSO the
same last part as me. he says yes and leads me all the way there and lets me
have the first one. while he waits for the rod to respawn he then leads me
to the guy in everfrost who gives you the rod. boom im done i have my rod.
one of my guild mates asks if any officers are near FP to invite a new
member. im not near there but i say OMW. passing through EC i see someone
selling a batskull earring (5int) which usually sells for 400-500 i only
have about 350pp to spare so i thought i would try and see if he would go
that low
/tell how much for the batskull earring?
/reply 200pp
/tell 200pp?? do you know how much the go for normally? (not wanting to rip
the guy off)
/reply yah i do thanks for being honest and checking first though.
/tell yah no problem i would buy both at that price except i only have 350
not 400
/reply no problem sold for 350
/tell cool omw!
so i bought so batskulls for 350pp i then was extremly pleased and passed
out my 2 3int earrings to the first earringless newbies i saw as well as my
2int ring since im now at 205 int
its people like these 2 above who make this game great.
