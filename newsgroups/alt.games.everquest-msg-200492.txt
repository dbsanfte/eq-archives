Turn in Giant Helms to one of the guards at SS in WL (I think he is in WL, 
could be just inside SS on the WL side).  Not sure how much of a faction 
boost that is.  Just keep any of the helms you loot while killing Giants, 
and use those.  You can purchase the helms too from players, but, may not 
be worth the cose.  Another option is to leach off a named kill in Kael, it 
is polite to ask first though.  I am reasonably certain the quest is doable 
at indiff, probably even lower faction level.
