Hmm....I would have taken a Warrior/Cleric/Enchanter along with a
Shaman for backup heals and buffs. Then an additional melee class for
extra damage (Rogue or Monk preferred but a Ranger, Sk, Paladin or
Bard also work) then add a caster or pet class (Wizard, Necro, BL or
Mage....mage has good DS for tank, can also throw Bard in here as
well) Hmm...not leaving anything out am I?
