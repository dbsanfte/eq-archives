I am not sure if they read the NG more than the subject lines, but I
thought I wouldn't chance it.

This would ruin the game, with mommy's plastic, a punk could buy all
the gear he needs to cluelessly fumble through an LDoN with me.

I am sure there would be plenty of powerlevel for cash sessions, and
no reason to really do much except 1hp dam to any mob, until they
group with me.

The Casino problem would be even worse because then it would be
gambling for REAL MONEY. Nothing like unlicensed gambling.

Don't do it, PLEASE! I would consider the game hopelessly comprimised,
and then yes, YCBMS.
