It does.  If you're level 50 and you have a meditate skill of 200 you're
going to regain mana a lot faster than if you were level 50 and meditate
skill of 1.

So it seems to me that if you're a level 50 with a med skill of 200 and you
get this 5% medallion you'll be medding with a skill of 210 which is faster
than 200.
