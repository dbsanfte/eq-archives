Oddly no, this was the guild that actually wanted an SK, and only had 
one or two.  And then invited another four or five after me.

I ended up joining up with the guild which had been fussy before, funny 
what being several levels higher than their next biggest tank did to 
that "we aren't sure we want another SK" attitude.

Private conversations with some of my many friends in the guild suggest 
that they have had their own leadership problems, but hopefully have put 
them behind... to quote one, "those responsible have been sacked"

After joining I discovered that the guild leader is an SK.  Apparantly 
its a very popular class on Combine for some reason, maybe people 
thought the same way I did, in terms of picking an MT class which could 
solo its way out of a paper bag (not a two ply one, but at least its 
something)
