How the hell do I do it?  A second copy of the original game and SoL
installed with no problems, but when I brought up PoP this morning it
opened up that stupid windows program that asks if you want to
'modify, repair or remove'.  It doesn't give me an option for the
directory to install to, it just assumes I want to do something with
the original installation.  I've used both sets of discs to see if
using the second set for the second installation works, that didn't
change it.  I tried uninstalling off of one drive before installing on
the second drive to see if it would auto-install to the main drive on
the next try.  Didn't work.  Went to everquest and was told to delete
a file called "launchpad.exe" in the registry under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE-> Software-> Microsoft-> Windows-> CurrentVersion->
App Paths, but I can't find it, and a search of the registry doesn't
find it either.  Anyone?

Oh, and what I really love is their little question at the bottom,
"was this document helpful".  Instead of "yes", "no", or "I don't
understand", they've chosen to let you say "maybe, but I'm too stupid
to know for sure" or "maybe, but I'm too stupid to read".  (Well,
that's *basically* what it says :p)
