Just install them in order, run the patcher and you'll be good to go.
You won't need to put in any account keys, just log in your old
account name and PW. Only thing you'll loose is your custom settings;
friends list, hotkeys, etc.  LoY will download automatically, I think
there's a check box for it in the patcher config screen.
