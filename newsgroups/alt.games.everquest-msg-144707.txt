At the MMORPG scale (thousands of players) this would be interesting
only to students and practitioners of grief play.  At the NWN scale
this could be great fun.


Here's an alternative for you (or anybody else) to shoot holes in:

The thing I find most annoying about faction in EQ is that, with the
exception of a very few unraisable factions that have little or no
effect on most players, you can cheerfully bounce back and forth
between maximum (often ally) and minimum (kos) without restriction.
I'd like to see a system where each time you take a negative faction
hit there is a chance that part or all of that hit permanently lowers
your cap with that faction.  And when you kill the major mobs on a
particular faction you would always suffer a substantial permanent
faction cap reduction.  So that, for example, you might manage to get
non-kos to the Freeport Militia faction after killing Sir Lucan
<once>, but after the second time he wouldn't forget about it ever.
It seems to me that this would've made faction and alliance choices
far more interesting in Velious.

As to Tim's question about faction when you kill an isolated mob...
The PC's are immortal, have what amounts to telepathic communication
with one another, and are (sometimes) actually intelligent.  It's
tough enough on the poor mobs that they're (usually) dumber than a
d00d, now you want to steal their memories and telepathy too?
It's tough to say for sure, but I'll bet that Local 666 of the
Amalgamated Gimps and Wimps would put up quite a fight over that
particular workrule change.
