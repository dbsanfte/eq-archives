The OP already has 250 in JC, so doesn't need to worry about skill
increases.  The chance of success is not affected by your stats, only by
your skill level vs the trivial level of the item you are making.  This is
the current, general consensus among tradeskillers, and is the latest word
from Verant on the subject as well.  Mind you, it won't hurt anything to
boost stats as much as possible, it just won't help either.  I should add, I
have not personally tested this, just based on hanging out at eqtraders a
lot.
