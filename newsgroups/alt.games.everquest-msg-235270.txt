From the shadows, the mysterious xekaris@wmconnect.comm.cs.com
(Hssssssssssss) (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>>Foraged bookworms from PoK were giving 1200 points! LOL!
>>Tinkered animated bait got 1000+ points. People were getting
>>1 million points.
>
>Yeah.  I only ended up with 1.5 million before they were permakilled.  Too bad.
> :-(

I wonder if they'll fix this by wiping everyone's points out,
eliminating as many of the exploits as they can, and then raising the
costs.

"Oops!"

Hard to see any other way of fixing it now.
