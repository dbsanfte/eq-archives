That was kinda what I had in mind.  I'm not really sure how something
like this would affect "class balance" (the thought behind the long
recycle is that that would focus the impact of the discipline mostly
on large raid targets, as opposed to xp grinding or zone clearing),
but I do think it would be great fun to watch a dozen or two enraged
dwarves actually put a noticeable dent in a dragon, for instance.
And I can imagine this being used in conjunction with spam healing to
implement a tank transition (more hits + more damage = faster agro
build-up), tho I don't know how it would compare to the techniques
currently in use for that purpose.
