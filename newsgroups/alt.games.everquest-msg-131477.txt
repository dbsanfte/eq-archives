No, you do _not_ have a right to read any newsgroup you want.  That is a
service carried by Cox, at their discretion, to entice more customers to
suscribe.  Unless you have a contract with them that says they will provide
you with usenet service, you have not right to it.  What you _do_ have a
right to, however, is to search the marketplace to find whatever product you
want (as long as it's legal).  If it's not Cox, then so be it, if it is Cox,
very well.

I also have a right to search the market for what I want, which is an ISP
that doesn't carry racist groups.  I'm asking Cox to provide me that
service.  It is not my _right_ to recieve that service, however, and no one
is obligated to provide it.

Why is it you're trying to erode my rights?
