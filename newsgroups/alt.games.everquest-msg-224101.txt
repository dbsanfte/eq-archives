I know they've deliberately set things up so we can't plan in advance 
what we want to get in LDoN for our points, but I personally don't see 
the Vision involved in making it work that way.

And I'm willing to break that vision, either way.

So; anyone have a page listing all the stuff we can buy with our LDoN 
points?


In particular, I see a level 52 spell that seems attractive, although I 
don't quite understand how it works, at any rate it looks like a pet 
buff and mana regen buff and HP buff all at the same time.

But its buyable only with LDoN points... only I have no idea WHICH kind 
of points, nor any idea how many would be needed.

I've got around 120 points total, but spread out over 4 different 
mission types, I've spent 6 of them (on an INT charm that only works in 
LDoN but gave me a place for my LDoN augment) and literally haven't seen 
one thing I'd like to spend any of my points on since.

And by the way, about that adventurer's stone, thus far it too is 
completely useless.  I've gone on about 18 missions, failing only two, 
isn't it supposed to be at least a 1/1 augment by now?  It shows a 
reccomended level of 65, am I just too low for it?  Or am I supposed to 
be having further conversations with someone to unlock its powers?

Bought the LDoN Prima book, just because I buy anything EQ I see, and 
its just as useless on this as all the other Prima books have always been.
