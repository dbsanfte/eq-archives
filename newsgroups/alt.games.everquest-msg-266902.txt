70% ? WoW. How do you get that number ?
It isnt what I have been seeing.
In fact the bazaar trader numbers have been climbing and I have been worried
about getting a spot at times.
My merchant mule still sees a ton of gloomwater?(sp) silk.  The newbie silk.
 As well as kobold shackles and gold coins on almost every merchant near a
starting zone.
Seems odd there are a ton of new toons and several traders in a dying game.
