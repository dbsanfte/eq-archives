I wouldn't say it's so much a plan, as a combined effect of a touch of
genuine humility on Dubya's part, and the extreme venom the dems have
against any rep.  They call him and idiot, he says nothing, they keep going.
it all looks good until he's shown to not be such an idiot.

Let's put it this way, if he was as bad as they say, they wouldn't have to
say anything, just stand back and let him defeat himself without them
getting their hands dirty.
