Everybody is different, so this will mean different things to different
people.

If you got Gamer A who can only play 1 to 2 hours a day 3 or 4 days a week,
after a couple of months he/she won't have that much "really cool stuff"...
but for Gamer B who puts in 10-12 hours a day, 7 days a week... they often
will end up more powerful and with more powerful items after the same amount
of months playing.

By letting players buy and sell items found in the game, it lets the players
who don't play so much have a route to acquire items they might not
otherwise normally be able to.

To some this might sound "really lame" or "what a waste of 'real' money?"
but otherwise you would just end up with the most powerful characters either
just hoarding stuff or doling it out as free gifts to the others... that
means the items would either be effectivly "gone" from the game (they are in
the game, but nobody is using them) or what might be an otherwise
cool/valuable item becomes common stock found on the streets.

I haven't played anything lately, but I can recall to times gone past in
games where the high level players would often just give out all their
"useless" stuff to the next 1st level character around the corner.  To the
new player this stuff is all amazing and godlike compared to the crummy
sword they buy at the store for 1gp... but as they use this stuff and get
used to players just forking stuff out the true "value" of the item
depreciates because "everybody has one of those..."

On the other hand... there is resentment when the powerful get something and
don't value it because everything else they have is better... IE: the
developers might put in a really cool and unique +3 cloak... just to have
the item, a group of powerful characters goes out and gets it... but when
they have it they realise "geez, we all have +5 cloaks and this is only
+3... none of us want this" and so they just put the item into long term
storage... effectivly removing it from the game.... which can piss off the
lower level players because its better than what they have, but they can't
get it because its now gone from the game world.

Because these games attract so many different people there is no happy
medium:  one player might be only able to put in 5 hours a week into a
game... somebody else can put in 100... another might work 30hrs a week at a
minimum wage job... somebody else makes $100 an hour...

So to sell an item for $150 on eBay... one might look at it like "it'll take
me 100 hours of playing before I can get that... at 5hrs a week thats almost
half a year" or "to buy that costs me almost a full weeks pay!"... while to
another player they might see it as "I can play for 1 week and have that
item myself!" or "$150?  Its 3:30pm now... I'll make that much by 5pm from
my salary... why put in 100 hours if I just afford to buy that right now"
