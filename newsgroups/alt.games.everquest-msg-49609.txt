The general rule of thumb is:

The higher faction(ally, warmly, amiably, etc) the merchant cons, the 
better your selling or buying will go.

Some of the merchants (the one standing at the GFay/Felwithe zone on the 
Felwithe side comes to mind) are just stingy bastards. Sell the same loot 
to different folk and find out who your favorite is.
