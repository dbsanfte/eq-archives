Reminds me of a guy we got in SK at the gnoll spires quite a while ago.
He was a warrior, and almost immediately he started talking to a buddy
of his and ignoring us.  We finally dropped him from the group, and
it took him 15 minutes to figure out he had been dropped.  Then he and
his buddy started yelling at us for dropping him.  What was really
funny was that before he figured out he had been dropped, he would still
occasionally run over and take a few whacks at a mob we were fighting.
Apparently he was so clueless he didn't notice that he wasn't getting
experience and that the party window was empty :)
