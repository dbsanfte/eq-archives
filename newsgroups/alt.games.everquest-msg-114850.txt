Yes, at least for the druid epic, it's very non-linear.

You can start on the Cleansed spirit of Antonica as low as 30 or so
(corrupted mammoth)
You can start on the note delivery thing from Burning Woods as low as 1, but
I personally didn't do it until 39 (skyfire ports)
You can do the platinum speckled powder and the ancient pattern fairly low
level also, since there's no fighting involved, as well as the forages.
You can also purchase yourself a Jade Reaver for later usage if you're
rolling in cash (I paid 15k for mine under the mistaken assumption that I
would be getting a VSR stone soon, which is of course 3 days before my guild
poofed, and now I can't sell it)
