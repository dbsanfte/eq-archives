When we first started killing him (i believe an all-server first, we could
assemble the "gauntlet" heh..
in the first long hallway (leading upto the fallen pillars) we would
assemble equally on each side of the wall (with backs to the wall)

The idea was to keep him in the middle, whilst everybody on either side
would hold him there.. to stop the MA getting knocked back.

His blind was curable.. but I rememebr his dot wasn't.. we would just duel
die after the fight, to get rid of the crappy dot

Well we got the strat down on our first try, so not really a challenge.. i
dont forsee it taking long to get back to the same old thing
