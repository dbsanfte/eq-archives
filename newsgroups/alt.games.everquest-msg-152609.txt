Is it possible to shut down EQ while AFK?  I know for one example that any
software which opens a window that is "always on top" or if I program task
manager to run a batch file that has the defrag command in it (only easy way
I've got Windows 98SE to defrag one partition one day, defrag different one
another day, and so on...setting those settings in task manager & changing
the drive letter for one was changing for all).  When this occurs (always on
top or sometimes just a sudden pop-up window) EQ gave the ALT+TAB effect.
    Now here is the question.  Since now ALT+TAB gives the "crash to
desktop" effect (EQ COMPLETELY closes since you can't get back in anyway),
has anyone experimented with using this as a way to program EQ to close at a
certain time?  This is useful if you're in the Bazaar as a vendor, and need
some automated process done while you're AFK, such as recording a TV show
with your capture card.  I'd bet there isn't a card out there which can run
EQ (or any DirectX 3D game), especially in the Bazaar, or any Luclin zones
while capturing MPEG2 or even MPEG1 video or even low compression AVI video
all at the same time.
    Though I have wondered what you would do to the video card, mother
board, processor, & RAM, (make smoke, sparks, or fire) if for some reason
someone were able to (would also require not fully using a resource so that
something else couldn't also use it at the same time) run EQ with max
settings on (character models, textures, color, ect., on a zone such as most
Luclin or even Bazaar, all spell effects on max) using DX Windows in full
2048x1536 resolution, try to run full screen TV on top of it, with
transparent mode (ATI All-in-Wonder Radeons support this), live TV (Tivo
function) enabled, play a high resolution DVD in another window, duel
monitor output, and edit video (resizing & cropping + applying filters +
converting from one format such as MPEG2 to another like AVI) all at the
same time. ;)
