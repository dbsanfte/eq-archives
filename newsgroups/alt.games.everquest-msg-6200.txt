I dont believe that a zone is causing packet loss. For some reason, there is
tons of data sent from the server when you are in paineel... even when noone
else is in zone. I often go up over 2000 (number on the right of the lag
meter). I think your problem is your connection, but that it isnt a problem
until you get into the high data areas of paineel.
For a test, make a human at freport, and wander over to ec tunnel when its
really busy... you will be getting tons of data from the server and my guess
is you will have similar problems to Paineel.
