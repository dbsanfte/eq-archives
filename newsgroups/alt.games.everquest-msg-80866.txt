OMG, *thank you*!! These are GREAT, and I can't think how I missed them
(unless it was because I didn't use google ;) ) Just got the one of Legolas,
and am making up a rotating screensaver (I haven't had a screensaver since
Win95, I don't think), with the help of some of the 'puter geeks we have
around here. I added this one to my collection :)
