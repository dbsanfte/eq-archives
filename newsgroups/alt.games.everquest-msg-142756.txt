No one ever said there could NOT be a correlation.  As you
mention, killing (some) giants grants increases in both Coldain
and CoV faction.

They're *possibly* related.  But that's it.  It's possible to be
deeply KoS to Coldain and Ally to CoV.  Or Ally to Coldain and
deeply KoS to CoV.  Or KoS to every major Velious faction, for
that matter.  It's even possible to be Ally to all three, I'd
guess, assuming you have another character farm faction granting
items for you.
