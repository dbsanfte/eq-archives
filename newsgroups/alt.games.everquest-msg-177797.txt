Well, the way I heard it, and I was also on test since the beginning,
was that there were too many people with GM accounts that were not GMs
"buffing" (meaning level advancements) up their friends and handing
out all kinds of uber GM summoned equipment.    I remember that one
jerk that was from ID software ( don't recall the name) that somehow
got involved with EQ back then, and I know for a fact he was buffing
newbies up to   level 50 who were his "friends" as well as giving out
tons of gear.  I imagine it could be a combination of these factors
that led to the character wipe, which was then changed to just an item
wipe.
