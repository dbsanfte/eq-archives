OK, in terms of grouping, I'm really new also.  Since we're being
programmers today, what result should I expect in answer (below), and please
clarify if false.

boolean answer = ( MT == Main_Taunter  ? true : false ) ;

I tried the EQ online dictionary
(http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm), but they just define
this as "Empty", and somehow that doesn't seem to fit.

Cheers,
Eric
