Well my servers #1 guild (4th? guild to kill emp across all servers) did ST
the other day, first time in a while

primal is still a big boost for melees.. and if /cough you had some way to
see what the golems dropped from the zoneline /cough and saw they had 1h's,
its not too much work to go kill a 10minute mob

ST is cleared at ~7am EST on my server.. even the biggest guild doesnt have
people online at that time to go kill something better

most first broods drop trash imo

the point may be moot now but i mentioned ST keys in "high value" deals,
because about 4 months ago in G.Chat we were talking about this very thing,
and an unkeyed paladin said he personally would pay 200k for primal
