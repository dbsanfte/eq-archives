Warcraft III isn't exactly representative of WoW anymore than Lords of 
Everquest is representative of EQ1. It might not be your thing, but I 
wouldn't discount it based primarily on the RTS.

Well... Anarchy Online is quite mature now, with several expansions 
under its belt, and all the content and refinement that implies.

As an added deal, they are basically giving away accounts. You may 
download the software (no expansions), install it, and play it. No 
purchase price and *no subscription fees*!

If you want to upgrade to the expansions, then the subscription costs 
start kicking in... but its definately a nice move.

Of course... 

DaoC is the 'classic' alternative to EQ. And I'm sure you are aware of 
it.

Also... Horizons and AC2 both had weak launches...but i thought they had 
promise... and they've had time to shape up... they may have shaped up 
ok... I don't have a clue as I haven't followed either... but it might 
bear looking into.
