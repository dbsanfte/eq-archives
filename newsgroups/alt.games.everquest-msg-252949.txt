That sounds about right.  Remember, he has no TD AAs.  I pretty much gave 
up on charm until I got them.  Of course, now I wish I'd been using it all 
along. :)  But having charm break immediately, or nearly immediately, 
20-odd percent of the time, and needing a rez as a result a fair 
percentage of those was enough to convince me grouping instead was good. 
:)

Charm is a very powerful spell.  But it's well balanced that way.  
Remember that guy who 'soloed' Wuoshi that time, causing everyone to pitch 
a fit about charm being overpowered?  Nobody really paid much attention to 
the fact that he died something like 11 times trying to do that...
