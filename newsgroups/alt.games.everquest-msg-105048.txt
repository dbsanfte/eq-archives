I'd have to agree w/Ben, if you are going to kite, do it in zones that don't
have people hunting around.  If I see a guy fighting a beast of some sort, I
leave him be and look elsewhere.  I'm not goint to assume that he is working
on 3 or 4 creatures at the same time.  In short, don't be greedy and have
some respect for your fellow players xp needs as well.
