I'd agree with but I think what he means is that you have longer to get a
spell off inbetween swings, when you cast you cannot attack but it no longer
resets the attack timer, so if you had a 3sec gap between swings (30 delay)
and cast a spell with a cast time of 2 secs then you attack would not be
interrupted, you still swing again in 3 secs. Now say that spell takes 3.5
secs to cast, you won't attack in 3secs, you'll swing again when the spell
is cast, this happens on a 40delay weapon then the spell casting time falls
into that delay and your swing is not upset.

As I said, I'm with you on this, faster the better. Although the Wurmy has
an abundance of good points I'd still go for the dam/del ratio of the MoSS.
