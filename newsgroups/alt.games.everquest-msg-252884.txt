Don't think I've ever heard of them, but I see now why. :) At the time your
guild is active, my character is hawking wares in the bazaar while I'm
either in bed or trying my best to get there. :)

Aye, no harm in giving the full rundown; sounds interesting, and if I were
in the right playing time, and wasn't already a) guilded and b) have another
guild actively recruiting me while mine is on the downslope, I might be
interested. :)

Thanks for the info.
