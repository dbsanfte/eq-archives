No. If you didn't accept the responsibility of playing in a PvP
enviornment, you shouldn't be there. Now... if they used an exploit to
kill you with, then you have a point.

I'm not really in favor of bringing the courts into something like
that, but if we're going to mirror the 'real world', shouldn't there
be game controls with which to handle it?

'You have been found guilty of exploiting for monetary gain. I
sentence you to lose half your worldly items and spend 2 months in the
Qeynos jail!'

You could even have a 3 strikes and your out policy with the 3rd
infraction getting your account perma-banned.
