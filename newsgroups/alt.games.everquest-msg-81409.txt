I would have to agree- non-twinked monks are probably the most
poor.  As a rule if I am grouped with a monk for an extended
period of time I always give him a portion of my loot when the
night is over, sadly I think I am the exception rather than the
rule.

And yes, it is very level dependent.  Pre-40s I would say druids 
probably are the richest due to porting.  After you reach  the 30's 
cash really isn't a huge problem- and if it is you can always do 
Hill Giants in Rathe Mountains.  In your case I would head to the
Infected Paw in South Karana at 20- Gnolls at the spires frequently
drop fine steel (4-5pp) and there are centaur vendors in the zone
if you get overburdened.
