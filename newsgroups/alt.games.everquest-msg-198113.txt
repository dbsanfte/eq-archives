There hasn't been a server opening comparable to Stromm for a couple
years.  All the others they've opened recently with "standard" rules
have had massive transfers of existing characters from other servers.
And since the fresh servers they opened "back in the day" were not
opened after two years of nothing but split, special rules, and
transfer servers, I'd say your pronouncement is lacking in supporting
evidence and therefore premature.
