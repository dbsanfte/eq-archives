Who

The fifth and final mini-named in Temple of SolRo, that grants access to
SolRos chamber.
Seens as you used 15% just to get into the zone, you may not have realised
that when you clicked into his chamber, that too required a flag.

From left to right in the zone, are stairways and portals to mini named
(xuzl, jiva, riz etc), there is no planar projection upon death, rather,
when you kill the mob and click the portal back down, you will receive a
message (not a checklist, flag or key).
These are seperate from checklists and PP flags -- solro mini named are only
needed for SolRo chamber access, they aren't a requirement for Elemental and
PoTime access.

The permanent portal to PoFire is where said drake is, the flying disk in
the water, behind PoK
The reason for the "moved" message is due to a very old PoFire problem in
conjunction with the SolRo chamber portal to pofire.
