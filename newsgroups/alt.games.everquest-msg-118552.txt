I recall reading a Reader's Digest article quite a few years back where they
actually tested this with something along the lines of polygraph equipment.
The did things like have two plants in a room, a person goes in, shreds one
of the plants, they hook up their equipment to the second plant, and the
person who shredded the plant comes back into the room, and, lo and behold,
the plant reacts to that person entering the room.  Not saying I put any
stock in it, don't know how scientific it was, or if it has been duplicated.
