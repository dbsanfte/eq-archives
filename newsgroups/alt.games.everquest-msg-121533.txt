What silliness. How many environments would you like me to name 
which would kill EVERY single human, and have absolutely nothing to 
do with the survival of the fittest ?? A leak from a nuclear reactor 
could hardly be categorized as natural selection.

SOME, I'm sure you meant to say, right ? SOME have survived without
apparent long-term affects. Some have survived with moderate affects.
SOME have developed a myriad of psychoses from mild to severe. And 
SOME have committed suicide as a result of it. And NONE of them could
in anyway be linked into a Darwinian progression.
