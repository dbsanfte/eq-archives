The lack of understanding of online communities within the very
companies that create the games is shocking.  �Build it and they will
come.� Ho ho. They will come, but they won�t stay. But they stayed for
Air Warrior. Why? Because the community carried the game well beyond
it�s actually technological lifespan. In online multiplayer gaming, the
players ARE The Game. The product that they use to play is only the
vehicle, the medium of play. Some day a game company will come along
that understands this, and the online world will see a second
revolution.
