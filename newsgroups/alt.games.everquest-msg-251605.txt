Then I stand by what I said above.  No reason to bring up your LDoN 
deficiencies before getting the group, particularly not on the LFG tool.

There's nothing I can think of thats especially different about LDoN 
compared to other places.  There are some "ropes" to be shown; four 
different basic goals, and the fact that you have a time limit to 
accomplish your goal in.  But if you aren't group leader, those things 
aren't really your concern; other than expending a little extra effort 
to keep things moving as fast as you can on your end: no smoke breaks, 
no screwing around -even- if you are apparantly well ahead of schedule.

Every new place you go will have mobs you don't know, differences in 
heal response, immunities so on and so forth.  It would be foolish for 
anyone to expect that everyone they meet always knows everything about 
each thing they do.

My point is, yes, its in your best interest and theirs that they know 
that LDoN is new to you... once you are already in the group.  Its a 
rare group that will kick you because you don't know a particular zone 
they are going to do... but its not at all uncommon for someone who's 
openly being ignorant and negative (which I know isn't the case, but it 
can look that way when "never did LDoN before" is all they know about 
you) to not get picked in the first place.

See, now you are being negative again.  I think there's something to 
what you are saying; SOE's neglect of their core market (which they've 
recently mentioned are the 30 to 50 players) in favor of the high end 
has a lot of people jumping ship, and naturally that leaves a 
preponderance of "get to the high end" folks in the game.  I don't, 
however, think its All of them, not yet anyway (we'll see what happens 
when EQ2, which is reportedly aimed more at the casual player, comes 
out).  You just have to look harder.

I do, however, think you have to improve the way you present yourself if 
you want to find those people.  And I think you're going to have to 
suffer some grouping with the hardcore speed leveling fanatics in order 
to find the more relaxed gems.

Funny thing is, sand off the veneer of EQ terminology and I could be 
talking with a teenager about dating: don't be negative, don't tell 
everyone about your problems when you first meet them, do be honest as 
soon as its appropriate, do expect to see a lot of losers before finding 
someone you really like, don't stop trying just because you've been 
dissapointed.
