<replying to OP>
First off, no one owes you anything.  Not saying that's what you said, but I
just wanted to make that clear in case it wasn't.  Next is that if no one
responded then what you offered was not interesting to them, or they did not
hear you.  You might want to try doing the role-playing thing and addresss
them personally.  People generally can't resist an uncommon interaction.
