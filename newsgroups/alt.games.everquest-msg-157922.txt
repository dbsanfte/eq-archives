This is how i did about 90% of my search for research components.  It may
cost a little coin, but it's easier than tryin to hunt the mobs.

An interesting trick for ANY container (including vendors with LOTS of
inventory):

Hold down ALT and roll your cursor over an item in the container...all the
item names will instantly appear as long as you hold down ALT and keep your
cursor over the item.  Very handy when you see 6 runes and need to check
them all.
