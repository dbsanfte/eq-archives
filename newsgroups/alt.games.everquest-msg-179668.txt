Ahh now that makes sense, it picked up on "skat"
All who mentioned double caps, I just added that to show it was meant to be
two words, as far as I know it doesn't allow you to enter double caps
without  a GM/Guide adding a ` to the name.
With current naming policy I could get away with "Eatsyellowsnow" as a
surname so I was a little peturbed by the rejection, I did petition but
later decided on something else and deleted my petition.
