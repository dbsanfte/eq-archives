>  Once again.. Do you even play a monk?

Why do you ask?

If you are trying to refute an argument, refute it ! dont weasel around and
try to insinuate something . Do what sergey does and hold up each statement
for ridicule, comdemnation , or perhaps even faint praise :p

My pedigree is actually quite noble thank you . I dont think it means as you
must however . If your curious I play a 60 chanter , 60 cleric , 54 druid ,
40 monk on innoruk . All but the 60 cleric are on the same account . I didnt
play the 60 cleric from birth to end but I most certainly helped do so .
What I do think means alot is I play my characters better than anyone else
plays theres :p I know the abilities of all the classes because thats my job
, and you sir sound like you dont .
