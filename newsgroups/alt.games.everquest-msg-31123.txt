Downtime.  
I spend a lot more time down medding and healing and very vulnerable
when I solo.

Equipment
I don't know about you, but I don't think I could have soloed into
Traks Teeth and got that Iskar BP all by my little self.

Skills
It's hard to develop dungeon hunting skills solo, or grouping skills
in general when you are all by your lonesome.

General knowledge of the game.
I learn much of other classes when I am grouped with them...
weaknesses, strengths, abilities.  Zones that you can only get in and
out of alive in a group.  

Socialization.
Building a firm network of friends, allies to enhance your playing
enjoyment of the game.
