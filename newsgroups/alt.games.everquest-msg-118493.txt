No, no....I meant basically the amount of people involved in the same game.
Yes, the speed of FPS's demands a good, solid, free-flowing pipe, but with
today's MMORPG's with gawd-knows how many people on, I just can't seem to
think 2 systems sharing a single 56k pipe could possibly being sufficient
for anything more intensive than, say, Email chess.

Either way, I would be banging my head against a wall trying to get EQ to
work under this condition.  Soon he said he will have cable modem.  I would
simply wait for that.
