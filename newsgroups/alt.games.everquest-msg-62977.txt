"Uses" and "alters" seems to be a very important distinction here. ;) If the
new patcher requires the file, yeah, they'll distribute it via the patch
server. I SERIOUSLY doubt that they'd be so stupid as to change Windows
system files, though. While I don't generally give the Verant coders much
credit (lack of testing, mostly), they ARE smart enough to know that if you
screw with files that Windows itself uses all the time, it breaks things. :)
