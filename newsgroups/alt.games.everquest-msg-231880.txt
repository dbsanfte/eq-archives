By this time there were a number of games that were popular that did send
information back and forth to players (albeit some at a slower rate) where
the players had their hands on that data. VGA planets and Stars were two
examples from the whole pbem group - all had either had problems with
hacking or had gone from the start by keeping master data at the
server/host end. This would have been basic market research they should
have done for Diablo. MUDs you ditched as being non commercial -
Commercial or not does not mean you can simply ignore thier structure they
were popular. Avalon had been going for ages by Diablo's time and
basically did not make that mistake. IIRC Meridian was out by then as
well, again not the same mistake. If Diablo was the first 'big name' their
foundation would have been the games present at the time however small.
The information on said games was readily available on usenet if nothing
else.

Oh I can well believe it was corporate not listening to the developers
that caused the issue. It wouldn;t surprise me if the dev team saw it and
had solutions beginning to build up...the patches started coming out
remarkably quickly once the bad PR about multiplay started - thats what
impressed me most about Blizzard.
