    To do that, you have to overcome socialization issues. How large do
people consider the penalty of a lengthy CR deep in a dungeon to be? How
difficult do people think it is to get into a group? If I think any death in
a dungeon will waste my entire night, assuming I even get a group (I might
be LFG at zone all night!), I'm not likely to go to a dungeon, am I? Reward
for time invested once in a group isn't the only measure people use to
decide if they should go someplace, but it's the only one Verant can
control.

    *chuckle* It's a fair number more than that. Here's just two anecdotes
from last night's adventures: a guild group consisting of a warrior, bot
cleric, and shaman went to near the Chardok royals area. Shaman had high
faction, so he pulled and they let the cleric melee (they put Avatar on her
for kicks). Four blues of AA XP in 30 minutes. Second anecdote: guild wizard
went to The Grey to quad Sun Revenants. Half a *yellow* of alt XP per quad.
A guild bard kited them, and was getting between 1.5 and 2% of an AA point
per kill. The mobs are out there - go find them. There's even a very nice
camp filled with level 60 mobs that *always* drop loot items worth about 1 K
in Fungus Grove!

>  After all, people grouped in the 'easy' zones before.

    They still will. They just won't get as much reward for it. People will
still value the ability to AFK at will, or not have to deal with a CR, or
not have to go LFG, more than you'd imagine.

    You're in a good guild. After the day's raiding is over, grab a few of
those guildmates and head someplace tough for once. Even the "popular zones"
have places that are tougher which never seem to see use - Juggs and Shrooms
in Sebilis, royals in Chardok, Warlord/Royals in Fungus Grove, the
Broodmother area in Velk's. Go there. Have fun. Be challenged!

    I admit that I'm horribly biased - I'm a cleric, a class that really is
only needed for areas that are challenging. I also have great guildmates
that can handle challenges like that. But what do you remember as the "great
times" in EQ - the twelve hour XP grind in an_easy_zone01 where you racked
up six or eight AA points, or the tough fights where you really had to work
just to stay alive?
