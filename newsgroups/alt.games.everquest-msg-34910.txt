1) is much better than you would think. Since the hybrid changes a
troll sk is a MASSIVE character which levels very fast even solo.
Since mine leveled to 32 very fast solo, you and your wife only
playing together would really get bang for your buck. Rather soon
though the shaman would probably be spending most of its time sitting
medding to heal the troll after slowing the critter, this would be a
very easy combo and trolls are one of the most fun and easy races to
roleplay well and quite a bunch of fun. More below.

2) that one really rocks more than the 2 trolls in a way. But I think
you are missing a bet. Really a better combo than either of these
would be a Troll shaman but an Ogre sk. The trolls innate regen is not
going to matter for the ogre when it has a shaman to heal it, but the
troll will be regenning twice as much hp normally on top of its regen
spells when its converting HP to mana. Ogre is about your BEST sk,
since it can't be stunned from the front and has great str and sta.
Int and mana are just not huge concerns eventually especially now that
SKS lifetaps are not 3 x the mana of its parent class, your mana goes
much further.

The trolls suffer a 20 percent xp penalty and the ogres a 15.

Unfortunately though, Sk is a much better combo with a shaman or druid
than a warrior or rogue is because SK brings the missing things to the
party. A druid or shaman can't fear but the sk can which makes even
high level duo combat quite doable. Meanwhile, if youve ever tried to
heal a warrior tanking things as a shaman or druid, you feel like a
pretty poor healer eventually. Of course the shaman can slow but
still, sk just works so much better.

#6 is just not going to work well unless you and your wife eventually
group with a cleric or something also. If you only want to play
together Sk and shaman is still looking like the best combo. #5 would
also be pretty bad. 4) iksar shaman and sk would be good, but your
wife wants to look good it seems.

How opposed is your wife to a dark elf sk? Though not as powerful as
troll or ogre its certainly a pretty one. Dark elf cleric and sk might
be fun. Oh you said you don't want cleric though. Hmm how about a dark
elf Necro and Sk? Since the lifetaps now take a more correct amount of
mana come level 30 some combo self and necro healing should not be
that big of a downtime chore.
