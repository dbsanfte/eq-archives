I love it when people make the game more fun with nice macros. I know a few
tanks who have several INC messages, all of which make me smile when I see
them. They alternate so it doesn't get boring.

I started with a macro for almost everything...
:sits down to meditate
etc...
Just played with two good friends and the game strolled by slowly, so no
harm done. As I grew into the game, I met more people and experienced
fast-xp-groups. Hard to keep track of everything and for sure no time to
tell all that I am going to sit down to meditate.

So I reorganised my macros and made a set of fast_and_clean and one with
emotes and stuff as garnish. Nowadays I never find myself using the garnishy
macros anymore..  Raids require efficiency and straightforward messages, not
things like:

:sayz 'Oh mighty Saryrn, give %T strength to annihilate all./that is good,
so we can feed upon the misery and suffering./we inflict.

:conjures some food and drinks for %T.
'May Saryrn feed well on your tender flesh

:softly touches %T's wounds which disappear miraculously.

:prays "Consume my Flesh, Saryrn, to strengthen my Soul!"  (you really don't
want to read this each time I cannibalize)

This one is usually liked when I am meeting people:
:smiles at %T Is it something demonic in her eyes or just a./naughty
twinkle...?

Got one for each spell and about thirty for socializing...  I loved playing
with them..
(yeah, I do AD&D too..)

I think there's just different ways to enjoy this game. I love the raiding,
organising at higher level I do now. Also love wandering around, discovering
new places, not getting xp for days. This post made me think back to the
days I roleplayed and I kinda miss it, so I'm gonna think of some new
efficient macros...
