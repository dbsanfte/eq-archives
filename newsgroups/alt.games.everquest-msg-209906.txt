i didn't mean it wasn't a situation to take advantage of people, sorry for
the negative connotations of my statement

what i meant was that no one will ever know if he doesn't have 3500 but only
has 2800, and he won't automatically be cast aside for tank, making him feel
useless...it's game, that's a white lie / placebo, and the beat goes on

it's a game, not medical school........
