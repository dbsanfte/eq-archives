No, he didn't. The taunts aren't specific enough. What he should
have done, though, is petition the bard for KSing, hoping that a
GM would be on at that hour. Fat chance, I know, but better than
nothing... Of course, he could /report the taunts along with his
petition, they'd probably be somewhat damning evidence.

Still, nothing would result from it if no GM was on in the first
place... Which happens a teensy bit too often for us euros.

This one I agree with.

This one too; if that bard was in my guild, I would like to know
about his assholish behavior.
