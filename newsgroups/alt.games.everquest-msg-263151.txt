Given that I don't think Warriors in Banded would be all that bad I'm 
not sure that its a 'worse problem'. Its definately more 'hardcore' I 
suppose because you can't just get everything handed to you on a silver 
platter like you can on a regular server. But then all special rules 
servers are 'more hardcore'... because of the, gasp, 'special rules'.

FV has TLC, a theoretical language barrier, one char per account...
Zeks have PvP...

etc..
