I saw that effect in action last night on Xev. Wife had already set up
her mule character on my account to sell off some miraculous meals type
baking stuff. I was going to log off for a couple hours of non-EQ
activity, (*gasp*... yes, yes. Flog me.) and decided to dump some items
on the mule to sell while afk.

I don't remember how much I paid for my Crystilline Robe, but it's a
nice item with pretty decent stats for an INT caster. Did a check among
the hundreds of peopel vending in the Bazaar and found a few selling in
the 400 plat range. I also saw two for one hundred, and one for *FIFTY*
plat. Too many people lowballing the ones with a somewhat reasonable
price. Same with some other items I had, duplicate spells, etc.

There were a number of mid fifties spells you could pick up for fifty
plat in the bazaar. In /auction people generally wanted at least 200
even for the fairly common ones.

The only items that I thought were going strong were fairly unique items
and gemstones used in tradeskills, etc. Blue Diamonds seemed to be
holding their value in the 2K range.  I finally decided to try to unload
my Shissar Dagger. There were zero of them for sale, so I tagged it for
750 plat and put it up. We shall see.
