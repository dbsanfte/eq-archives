In any city, including thurg, kael and skyshrine. Unfortunately melees
and even casters can't bind in crystal caverns or the small town
there. This is too bad because being able to bind there would get more
people of the appropriate level in there killing stuff.

Kill giants in Kael. The outdoor ones won't do much. If higher people
in your guild are killing some in kael ask to go along and hit them
once or cast on them once for faction. The faction raises are really
huge there. Killing even the outdoor drakkel wolves for faction is
really pretty pointless.. it takes hundreds of such hits to get to
okay faction with skyshrine while it only takes one kael raid to get
to glower with skyshrine.

Yes, velious by design makes it very easy to have both the coldain and
skyshrine/cov factions maxxed by simply killing giants in kael. You
can even merrily kill all the outdoor dragons and dragons in west
wastes and still be allied just by killing giants in kael. You can
even take north TOV cov hits and still get to allied again fast on a
kael raid.

So you can have great faction in skyshrine and thurg but at the
expensive of bad faction in kael. Thurg is about the most useful town
anyway, with most tradeskill vendors there and such.

I think 36 is good level to do most of the tower of frozen shadow in a
group. I'm not exactly sure where those drop but its still not the
highest part of the tower.
