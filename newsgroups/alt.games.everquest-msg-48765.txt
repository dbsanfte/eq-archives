On the Cazic-Thule server, East Commons is the place where I avoid at all
costs.  If I MUST go through that zone for some reason, I turn off shouts
and auctions.  Fortunately, I have only been there twice since the Firepot
room was released with the Kunark expansion.

By the way, it is THE PLACE to go for auctions.
