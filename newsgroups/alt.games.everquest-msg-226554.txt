Especially considering that monks were competing with no one in their FD
pulling racket.  Most necros and SKs wanted nothing to do with that scene.
It's kinda like the mod rod nerf... it didn't nerf the mages who summon
them, it nerfed the clerics and wizzys who ate them like pockey.

I think tweaks need to be made, but they should be done carefully, and with
input from those who actually play the class, all the way from the enchanter
doing CC in HoT, to the paladin who left LoIO and decided to start soloing
for twenty levels (guilty).  This ivory tower balancing act is only going to
bring the whole game crashing down.

Possibly.  The more things they add in for balancing, the more difficult
it's going to be to keep everything in perspective.

Kind of like the mage's problem with people percieving that their pets were
leeching XP, long after it was changed.

I don't think it's a problem, I just don't think they really thought out
class roles from the very beginning.  Considering all the classes they'll
have in EQ2, I'm going to wager that this will be an even bigger problem
than before.
