Coming up next, your comments and questions on issues discussed in the
programme, like this one from Deborah Terreson, calling from
misc.writing: 

>And the purpose oft his obviously pointless trollery is?

The Lament of the Trollee

The purpose of this pointless troll'ry is
To make thee answer, ma'am, and thus 'tis served; 
None made thee click on "send", thy fervent wish
This pointless troll his recompense, deserv'd
Though it might be, to give. Now art thou caught
Within his snare, 'twas ever thus. And thou 
With thine own hook hast thine enslavement bought.
What hast thou done? And what shalt thou do now? 
Had thee but shut the fuck up, stayed thy tongue, 
Thou had'st escaped this sordid trap and flown
Ne'er to reflect, when thou'rt no longer young:
"Had all the things I know now then been known". 
	Of all the words of heart and soul and pen
	These are the saddest: "Won't do that again".
