Maybe that's their version of splitting the mobs.  If more than 1 come, 
just tag the one you want when they wander back to their spawn point.  If 
that's their best tactic for fighting in KC, that's sad.

No, he has no right, even by server conventions instead of Sony's 
conventions.

They're idiots if they expect people to leave it alone.  If one person 
drags a mob through you to get to a zoneline and then zone, it's going to 
put you on the hate list if you are KoS, like you assumed.

Next time it happens. . .

:hands idiot_puller_01 a clue.

Then ignore them and whatever they yell in open channels.

I'm sure this "zone-pulling" can be put to good use in some places, but KC 
is not one of them if there are people near the zone lines.  It's a case of 
morons doing moronic things.
