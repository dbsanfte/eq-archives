No, because that would be cruel.  However, calling someone (say you, for
example) a complete and utter retard/moron is ONLY politically incorrect.
Oddly enough people have been saying the same types of things (undoubtedly
to your forefathers) for millenia.  Only NOW it's "not ok" to call a spade a
spade (yet another politically incorrect thing to say).

Get your head out of your ass long enough to see that sensitivity to this
nth degree is bullshit.
