    On Sunday, we managed to get 34 people to raid total, including recruits 
and bots that normally are NEVER played on a raid. Our usual numbers are in 
the low 50's. At this point, we're reviewing what lower-level guilds we can 
consume by recruiting away all their good members. Other servers report the 
same - between EQ2 and WoW Open Beta, a lot of people aren't online. I can't 
tell if the people who left are just trying other games, and will come back, 
or if these people were just killing time with EQ until a better game came 
along, but the numbers are down.
