Depends on what you are buying.

I buy a lot of peridot.  As in "by the stack".

With my normal cha of 50, one peridot runs me around 15pp.  With
a pair of stiens plus my party hat (cleric only headgear that drops
in Kael, Circlet of Cerulean Smoke, has cha on it, silly item except
that I can put it on to buy stuff with) to get me over the 106 cha
cap (for buying stuff there is no difference between 106 cha and 255 cha)
I get them for around 10pp.  Thats a 100pp savings in buying ONE
stack of the rocks.  Course when I bought them they had just
come out, and I paid 200pp each.  Still paid for themselves in
just a couple days.
