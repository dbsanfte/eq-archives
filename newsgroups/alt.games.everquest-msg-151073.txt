Surely you have found yourself in a group with someone who, even below
level 30, was quite ignorant of their class abilities in your way of
thinking. Was it or was it not a bit annoying? Granted, up to level 10
or 15, you can pretty much expect it, but that is the natural learning
process going on there. By level 20, you should have at least a pretty
good idea of how to play your class effectively.

Btw, my highest char. is only a 31, but I have seen plenty of class
ignorance up to this level. I can only imagine the damage some of
those people could do with a high-level kit char.

Sure. However, no one likes to be put into the spot of having to tell
someone they need to leave the group because they are holding everyone
back or creating an unneccessary risk to the others. I don't care how
up front and honest you try to be with people, it's still an awkward
situation. Add to that the player in question not agreeing with the
rest of the group and trying to smatter your name(s) around. Sure, a
good rep should be able to withstand the rantings of an idiot, but who
wants *anyone* even trying to soil their rep? It's plainly just not a
desirable situation.

Again, and moreso in pick-up groups, they usually don't have any idea
of his/her competency until the action starts.

Uh, yeah, I would. Wouldn't you? That would be an awful lot of trouble
to go through to get a group together.

This is quite true. However, EQ cannot be all things to all people and
remain as enjoyable as it is.
