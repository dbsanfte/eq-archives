My biggest complaint since Kunark came out was the lack of illusions after
level 44.  I mean, enchanters are already The Most Powerful Class (and gnome
enchanters the smartest and cutest).  The enchanter role is a pretty well
defined one.  While I have fun playing mine, I wanted to have more
illusions.

Thanks Verant!

Vah Shir...nice, but only uberguilds get it.  Maybe one day I will.
Scarecrow at 63...silly run...cool.
Froglock at 65...back flips...VERY cool

Now if only they'd give us gender changers...female ogre...hubba hubba!
