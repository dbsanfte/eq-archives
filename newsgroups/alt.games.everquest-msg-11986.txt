There's no sin in that, certainly, but unfortunately all too many
people (and legislators) feel competent to have a firm opinion on
what "proper" gun control would be, without actually knowing the
first thing about the subject (not just firearms per se, but
also the way that black markets work, actual criminal behavior as
opposed to how they are depicted on TV dramas and in movies, etc.
etc.)

For example, anti-gun legislators and media talking-heads made
a big deal about a single poll that showed that "70%" of the
American public was in favor of the then-pending so-called
"assault weapons ban".  What they "forgot" to mention is
that subsequent polls revealed that the vast majority of
that 70%-in-favor were under the mistaken impression that
most of the firearms affected by the proposed ban were
machine guns.  Actual number of firearms affected by the
ban which were actually machine guns:  ZERO.

There was even a hilarious incident where then-Gov. Lawton
Chiles of Florida, a big proponent of the ban, was
informed (correctly) that his hunting rifle would
qualify as a banned "assault weapon" under the proposed
law.  His utterly clueless response:

   "I've supported a ban on assault weapons. [My rifle]'s not
   an assault weapon. It's a rifle I got for turkey hunting.
   It folds up. I've got all kinds of guns. The way you've
   portrayed it is I'm sitting there with an assault weapon."
                                -- Lawton Chiles, May 10, 1994

I don't know if even to this very day Chiles has managed 
to figure out the irony...

I could "try" them, but you made the assertion, you provide the

Actually, what I *really* have to wonder is why so many people
are under the very mistaken impression that the military uses
"similar" weapons.

If you can find any military anywhere that uses SEMI-automatic
firearms for actual combat duty (instead of for ceremonial
purposes, like the Chinese honor guard with their SKS rifles),
then you might have a point.  But they don't.  They use
select-fire FULLY-AUTOMATIC firearms.

Conversely, however, pump shotguns *have* been issued to
American troops for combat duty (in both WW II, and the Vietnam
war -- not sure about the Gulf War), precisely because the
US military fully understands the effectiveness of these
weapons, unlike certain newsgroup participants.

And if you had ever seen revolvers used in combat competitions,
you wouldn't be so fast to ridicule what can be done with them,
either.  For a real life example, there's the pizza delivery
man who was cornered by three robbers, all of them armed.
Realizing he had little to lose, he drew the revolver he
carried for self defense and fired two shots into each
robber.  He fired so rapidly that one of the surviving
robbers accused the pizza guy of having a machine gun.

Perhaps you're one of the many people who are under the
mistaken impression that "semi-automatic" somehow means
"machine-gun fire".  It most certainly does not.  Semi-automatic
firearms fire only one bullet per each pull of the trigger,
period -- just like a revolver, or any other non-machine-gun
firearm out there.  There's nothing special or different
about the way that a semi-automatic versus a non-semi-automatic
firearm fires -- it's still one bullet per trigger activation.


>Believe it or not, I am not in favour of any radical gun control in the US,
>(well, maybe siege mortars), because I don't think it would accomplish much.

On that we agree.  However, you seem to be implying that you do feel
the Australia ban "accomplished much".  If you think that *it*
made any substantial reduction in the likelihood or severity of the
next Australian mass murder (and there *will* be one, you know), then
I have to wonder what you think is magically different about Australia.


>I really can't see why anyone feels the need to own an AR-15,

You might as well say that you "can't see why anyone feels the need
to own any firearm", because there is ABSOLUTELY nothing that
sets the AR-15 apart from, say, a politically-correct Ruger
Mini-14 hunting rifle, except cosmetic differences.


> but if a
>country decides that is the way to go, so be it. To say that they are no
>more dangerous than a revolver is ludicrous.

Only because, with all due respect, you have no idea what
you're talking about.

Furthermore, you're misrepresenting what I wrote -- I never
claimed that the AR-15 is "no more dangerous" than a revolver.  It is,
by nature of its higher-velocity projectile.  But then, the same
could be said for almost any rifle except the lowly .22 LR which
is barely more than a glorified BB gun.  Certainly most "serious"
hunting rifles are far more "dangerous" than any handgun -- and
odds are Grandpa's hunting rifle is "more dangerous" than the
AR-15 that has you and Sarah Brady and Charles Schumer and
Dianne Feinstein peeing your pants for no damned good reason.

And ANY shotgun is far more deadly, shot for shot, than the AR-15.
The last time I checked (and admittedly I last ran the numbers
before Bryant went on his spree and increased the averages),
shotgun mass shootings had a far higher average body count,
AND far higher mortality rate (i.e., percent of people who were
shot who died as a result) than mass shootings committed with
so-called "military-style semi-automatic assault weapons".

However, the fact that rifles on average are more "dangerous"
than handguns doesn't alter in the least the truth of what
I said when I claimed that it's the height of ignorance to
say (as your unnamed "expert" supposedly said) that the
size or rapidity of Bryant's body count "could not" have
been done with another sort of firearm.  It very certainly
COULD have; his act, as horrifying as it was, was hardly a
feat so extreme that it could not have been easily
achieved with almost ANY type of firearm -- or bomb, or
pre-planned arson, or motor vehicle in a well-chosen crowd,
etc. etc.

Even in the allegedly gun-crazy United States, the top three
mass murders ever committed were done with:

   1.  A fertilizer bomb.  (Oklahoma City bombing, 168 dead)
   2.  A dollar's worth of gasoline and a match.  (Happyland
       Social Club murder-arson, 87 dead)
   3.  Dynamite.  (Bath Consolidated School, 45 dead, mostly
       children)

All of the 203 dead in #1 and #3 died in moments, the 87 who
died in #2 died in about two minutes.  I'm sorry, weren't
you claiming that killing "20 people in 90 seconds"
would "not have been possible" without a weapon of the "sort"
used by the Port Arthur murderer?

[From a Boston Globe editorial:]

# Media interest in Buford Furrow's Los Angeles atrocity has been
# massive. His Aug. 10 assault on a Jewish community center in Los
# Angeles - which left five people wounded, three of them young
# boys - was a national story from the moment it broke.

#
# Suppose, for instance, that the kids he tried to kill weren't

# Suppose he went after them not with an Uzi but with some other

#
# We don't have to suppose. Less than four months ago, just such
# an enormity took place. The media scarcely blinked.
#
# On May 3, Steven Abrams drove past the Southcoast Early
# Childhood Learning Center in Costa Mesa, Calif., where 40 small
# children were frolicking noisily in the playground. Deciding,
# as he later told police, "to execute those children," he pulled
# a U-turn, headed back toward the playground, and floored the

# the crowd of children. It stopped only when it ran into a tree.
#
# Abrams was unhurt. But Sierra Soto, a 4-year-old who loved to

#
# Two dead, five injured - Abrams's violence was far more grisly

And from the Detroit News coverage:

# "I was going to execute these children because they
# were innocent," Abrams told detectives, according to Lt. Ron
# Smith

And yet, the story ran in two paragraphs on page 6.  If he
had instead walked onto the schoolyard with a gun and achieved
the same "killed and wounded" count, you know very well that
it would be page one on every newspaper in the country, and
the lead story on CNN, ABC, CBS, and NBC.

And from the Orange County Register:

# Popov and son stopped to assist.
# "If he didn't hit that tree, there would be a lot more people hurt," he
# said. "The kids were all scattered. You feel so helpless when you can't
# get them up."

For another example, practically every murder-suicide involving
firearms makes the national news if children were killed.

>Everyone knows what
>schoolyard killers take to school with them.

Sure -- 1967 Cadillacs.  Or dynamite (as in the Bath Consolidated
School bombing that killed 45 people, 38 of them children).
Or any of a number of other things.

But hey, they only get news coverage when they use guns.
So it's no surprise that nutcases wanting to make a splash,
wanting to horrify the society that they think has done them
wrong, often bring guns to do their killing -- after all,
that's the only kind of murder that really gets attention,
that really makes people nationwide (or worldwide) go "EEEEK!!!"
sufficiently loudly, as the news media has made entirely clear.

People don't go on shooting sprees because it's the best way
to kill lots of people (see again the stats on the top 3
mass murders in US history, none of which involved firearms),
they go on shooting sprees because the media and the public
get more hysterical about shootings than they do about
anything else -- and the anti-social nutcases are AIMING
at causing public hysteria.  They'd find some other way
to horrify society if shootings were covered with the same
ho-hum-we'll-forget-about-this-tomorrow attitude that
the media accords other events in which far more people
are killed than in any nut-with-a-gun shooting:  "Forty-eight
people died today when a charter jet crashed near Townsville
today -- now here's Larry with the latest baseball scores."

But instead, with the news media, politicians, and
assorted shirt-rending sob sisters making as much of a
Most Horrible Thing That Has Happened Yet "event" out
of despicable criminal acts, every nutcase with a grudge
against society decides he can go from being a Worthless
Nobody to Nationally Infamous Forever and all he has to
do to achieve it is to play "I can top that" with the
recent "record holder" in the How Many People Can I Shoot
Olympics.


>Martin Bryant had access to cars, revolvers, lever action and bolt action
>rifles, yet what did he choose to kill with on that day.

He owned a fully automatic machine gun, but he didn't bother to
bring THAT with him either, did he?

But you're missing the point(s):

1.  Restricting, or even banning, an object does little, if
anything, to limit its availability to those who choose not
to follow the law -- and needless to say, maniacs planning
a mass murder aren't going to be slowed down by little things
like laws against contraband.  Paradoxically, banning an
object often INCREASES the availability of it, since the
black market arises to provide it, and the black market
is TOTALLY unregulated, unlike the legal market that used
to exist when the item was legal to own.  That's why just
about any high school kid can buy cocaine if he wants it,
but would have a much harder time buying morphine.

So the first fallacy of gun control is the pollyanna-ish
belief that restricting or banning guns actually makes
them any less available to people planning a crime with them.
Even in we-restict-guns-so-much-that-even-most-of-our-police-
don't-have-them England, two newspaper editors researching
a story managed, independently, to each acquire illegal
firearms within one day by simply asking around in some pubs.

So after Australia has spent a huge amount of money
confiscating all the semi-automatic firearms it can
manage to find (and make no mistake, a huge number were
instead driven underground by the gun-grab), the joke is
that any nutcase or common criminal that wants one can still
get one.  You'd think that people would learn from the
utter, complete failures of the Prohibition of alcohol,
and the War on (Some) Drugs, but they never do.

2.  Even if you could find the Warm-Fuzzy-Wish-Fairy and
get her to wave her magic wand and make all semi-automatic
firearms vanish from Australia (and then invoked her again
to place an impenetrable wall around your continent to
patch up the oversight that international smuggling is
a certainty -- if you can't think of any better way to
smuggle guns into your country, try hiding them inside
a bale of marijuana, no one would ever find them there),
nutcases could, contrary to your ignorant jeering, do
the same carnage (or worse) using any number of
politically-correct firearms that the Aussies have left
in place and legal.

And even if you got the Warm-Fuzzy-Wish-Fairy to grant
you a third and final wish and eliminate all firearms
from the face of the earth (and the last time I checked,
she was on extended vacation), nutcases would just turn
to some other means of achieving their goals (see above
for information on arson, bombs, cars, etc.), because
maniacs never think, "I'd like to shoot some people,
but since I don't have a gun, I'll just go volunteer
for Habitat For Humanity" -- instead, they think
"I want to kill people and horrify society to pay
'them' back for what they've done to me, now let's
see what I can think up that'll get that done..."

If they don't have any guns (or if they have guns but
are creative enough to not play "follow-the-leader" with
the unwitting urging of today's shooting-centric media)
then watch out, because then they'll have the time to
ponder all of the ways that one can cause some REALLY
serious mayhem.  How many more Oklahoma City bombings
or Bath Consolidate School bombings would you like to see?
How about another Happyland Social Club fire that
wipes out 87 people?  How about more Ted Bundys,
John Wayne Gacys, or Pedro Alonso Lopezes would you
like to see?  Serial killers (who stem from the same
twisted psyche as mass murderers) on average kill
more people, and evade capture far longer, than
mass murderers -- if you could somehow prevent
a would-be mass murderer from using any method that
would allow him to kill many people in a short time,
it's no stretch to think that he would be glad to
settle for killing one at a time, many times over.
Is this an improvement?

There are ivory-tower theorists who feel all smug
and certain about their belief that if you could just
ban guns, it would stop, or even slow down, violent
maniacs.  I do not in any way share their optimism,
and thus I can only shake my head at the enormous
waste (both in money and in police manpower, not
to mention public disruption and disrespect) that
goes into such huge, and hugely wrong-headed, initiatives.
It's "feel good" legislation at its worst, and it
greatly disrupts the lives of countless law-abiding
gun owners in the process.

Finally, I have absolutely no respect for the sort
of "we have to pass a law because the public is
hysterical" political pandering that results over
something that, as horrible as it may be, is far less
likely to happen to anyone than becoming a
multi-millionaire in a lottery.
