I have noticed that the number big usually happens when you type a number RIGHT
beside  a letter, like 1K, 200pp, weight 1.5
Type 1 K, 200 pp, weigth 1 . 5 instead, that seems to work.

But sometimes people ARE just stupid, had to leave my camp and run from DL zone
to giant fort in FM to sell a Rygorr glove, and when i get there, the guy tell
me he dont have money, but will trade 70pp and a Straw Spun belt for it.
That really pisses me off, when people KNOW the price, but dont tell they dont
have the money before you are there, because they hope you will sell to them
for the trades they offer, now you are there.
