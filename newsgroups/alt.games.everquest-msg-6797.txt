yeah... uh... thanks to the people trying to be helpful... they must have
picked up on the "i'm" FUCKING "new" part of my post.. first point taken..
could have read the news further back and saw that it was patch day, but my
upsy downsy name stays, because that is how that name was originally written
on the 70's pink floyd poster i have... which is where the name came from..
sorry if it bothers anyone... but ...uh...i'm pretty sure we're all grown
people who can accept that ...or you can all just flame the everquest
newbie, so you can be cool, if that's what you need to do....
