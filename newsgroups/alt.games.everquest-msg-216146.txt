But if I adjust to keep him at 80%, why not adjust to only pull when he's at
100%?  What benefit is there to me in having the group ever be less than
100% prepared for the next fight?

And honestly, I haven't done LDoN much but in the adventures I've done where
I was 2-boxing the cleric *and* tanking as a monk I don't see how the healer
could ever get down to 30% unless you don't bother pulling at all and simply
have the whole group charge each room.  I've actually done one LDoN
adventure that way.  It's fun.  :)

Not hardly.  Clerics' healing abilities are far better than all but the most
non-tanking group.  With constant pulls of 2s and 3s, and no enchanter, my
2-boxed cleric never drops below 50% mana.  And I freely admit that I'm not
the greatest 2-boxer, especially in regards to trying for any sort of mana
efficiency, as I leave my cleric standing the entire time.

I'll see your level 65 cleric, raise you a level 65 monk and a level 65
magician, and throw in a 56 necromancer, 52 ranger, 51 wizard, and 51 shaman
just for kicks.  I have a pretty good amount of experience at most
everything in the game, from being a newbie to being in an elemental guild. 
Only classes I couldn't log on and play effectively at most any level are
bard and enchanter, and I could probably do a passable job with those even
in LDoN.

Don't pull out your dick unless you're ready for the comparison.  :)

Perhaps you'd like to play some more with your time-freezing device where
the cleric doesn't tick up to that 21% that he will "NEED" while the fight
progresses.

Or, as is more likely the case, you can continue to *worry* about being
"safe" in a *game*.  I'll continue to enjoy myself and leave the pointless
worrying to you.  :P

And if I wait til everybody is at 100% mana, and the cleric and tank go LD
as soon as the mobs are engaged...

Oh, that's right, you were *worried* about being barely capable of handling
a pull so you wanted to med up, but I already knew "there ain't no such
thing as a sure thing" so as soon as we're capable I went ahead and pulled.

You might want to save this spiel for someone who doesn't play a monk. 
Don't forget, I had Sony program in special just-for-monks "mobs get runs of
good luck".

Ask a few clerics how many times they've died while out of mana compared to
how many times they've died with plenty of mana.  Go ahead, I'll wait for
you to come back with a truth of this game that you've obviously missed.

The enchanter or cleric goes and pacifies the target that I've already got
for them to assist and cast on then goes back to the group.  It's a
10-second break from medding.  They miss two whole ticks if they have to run
a little bit (and they probably don't, nice long range on pacify).  That
extra 20 mana would have done wonders though, wouldn't it?

I know from using enchanters on raids to pacify things that a resisted
pacify results in one of three outcomes (and resists aren't all that common
to begin with these days).

Outcome 1: nothing

Outcome 2: the mob comes single, even if it has to talk past 10 other mobs
that if you had nuked would have all come with it.

Outcome 3: the enchanter was unaware and standing close enough that the
other mobs get assist aggro.

Outcome 3 is the only one that's a problem, and is easily eliminated as a
problem by simply playing smart.  Of course, the horror stories I've heard
(and even seen) regarding pacify trains are all attributable to not playing
smart.  The cleric has pacify, but that doesn't mean they should actually
pull, merely assist, and it doesn't mean they need to go exploring for
targets to pacify, merely assist and cast.

Hell, I'd say a monk is *always* a better puller than a cleric.  But that's
going to be based on pulling experience a good portion of the time, because
pacify really is all that and a bag of nuts.

I've pulled with my magician, much as you described.  I didn't kid myself,
though.  I can equal my pet's DPS without even expending mana.

I have no need to worry about a disaster.  Any disaster that manages to wipe
a group that was at 30% mana collectively in LDoN would wipe a group that
was at 80% mana.  Again, ask some clerics whether they find themselves dying
out-of-mana or with plenty of mana left.

The cleric, wizard and enchanter gated...

You can add in all the hypotheticals you would like to, and I can come up
with even more ludicrous ones.  Try me.  :)

You can even eliminate any monk-specifics if you'd like, as I've pulled LDoN
adventures as my ranger and don't really do anything differently.  I'm not
splitting in LDoN, I'd rather fight 2 or 3 mobs at once.

How is 80% better than 30% when any fight of even multiple mobs won't eat
more than 20% mana?

You'd rather I eat the downtime early, or spread it out so that I have
constant downtime in smaller doses?  Why don't I wait until there actually
*is* a problem to deal with downtime, and finish faster if that problem
never materializes...
