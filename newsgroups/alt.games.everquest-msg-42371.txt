Bread is in shortage in most zones due to the ongoing plague in the
Karanas.  You might try FV or Thurgadin, but most cities have bread in
short supply.  There is a quest to take a shipment of breadloaves from a
centaur in South Karana to various merchants around the world, not sure
who gets the shipment in freeport.  I know there is an inn in NK that
gets some as it is closest to the centaurs, but since the amount of
experience the quest gave got nerfed to stop PL exploits on Sullon Zek,
not too many people bother to run the quest anymore.  You don't mention
your race, but if you have any way to avoid the ogre bouncers, you can
turn in bread to Innkeeper Gub in the Feerrott for decent coin, small
exp. and Faction with merchants, guards and Clurg.  It took about 15-20
trips to become high indifferent while in wolf form for my druid (Enough
faction to do the Stein of Moggok Quest).  My druid is currently amiable
in Wolf form and threatening in normal wood elf form.
