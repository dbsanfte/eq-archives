See the new guy in pit of doom in halas (to the left as you face the
woman) - need assembly kit first.  Use that to combine ingredients above;
tell him "I wish to craft X" and he'll give you a mold.  X = helm., bracers,
armplates, boots, legplates, gauntlets, breastplate.  Combine sheet + mold
in forge to create armor.

It's all lore/no drop though ...
