Finduilas was born very shortly after Norrath was discovered in the cosmos.
He struggled his way to 45th level before he retired.  He has traveled
Albion, Istaria and other worlds in the intervening years (shortly after the
release of Velious).

Reborn on Druzzil Ro as Finduilax (my name was taken when I moved from
Fennin Ro, I decided that the $75.00 was worth all of the time and effort I
had put into him being rather slow to level on average) I still carry the
same equipment I had managed to acquire all those years ago; a time when
Dwarven Work Boots and Soul Fire where desired items (not the most uber mind
you, but pretty good); when the Ro armor collection was not a horrible thing
for a Paladin in his mid 40's to be wearing.

Being a mostly solo player (short bursts of time at odd hours with the
occasional 2 or 3 hour stretch) I was able to hold my own in the areas I
hunted in Kunark and Velious.  Now I find that I often have a some
difficulties.  I do realize that the quality of gear I "should" have is
much, much higher than it was when I retired, and I am slowly working to
upgrade, first purchase was a Mace of the Fallen Crusader, followed shortly
by a Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood (I had only 2000pp to work with upon
my arrival on Druzzil) since I had no one handed weapons (long story).  Soul
Fire was my only weapon.

What I am asking is:

1)  Are there any suggestions for a, lets call it poorly outfitted, 47
Paladin to hunt?  I always have preferred killing undead, just a role-play
thing really, but hey, it is my specialty.

2) Any suggestions on gear to look out for?  I have been reading up on all
that has happened on Norrath since I retired and am slowly getting up to
speed.  Money has always been a bit in short supply for me, not horrid, but
not impressive in the least.

Any input would be appreciated.
