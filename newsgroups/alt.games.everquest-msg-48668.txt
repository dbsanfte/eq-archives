    Nope, and you should re-read. I said it's MORE difficult. Why do more
difficult things to achieve the goal of hitting level 60 if those things
don't help you?

    No crap. But it incurs MORE downtime for the same XP. So what's the
point?

    In other words, all these outdoors people have figured it out: go there,
as no other zone has as rich a reward/risk ratio. So why tell Jakugg to go
anywhere else?

    Yeah, I get jealous of people that have it easier than me, too.

    People with limited playing time have their entire day wiped out by a
death, perhaps more. And the time requirements of jogging back to where they
were can also wipe out the day. They KNOW that the best way to level up is
to simply not die. Death isn't just an XP penalty, it's a massive amount of
downtime.

    Even when it's empty it's full. Because of the mix of mobs it's PL
heaven and Fungiland, so even with five or six people in zone all of
kobolds, bats and bugs can be camped. Anything beyond those (basically,
Efreeti/Imps) is a commitment, as with the See Invis mobs there's no
sneaking to a camp.

    Agreed. High risk, but very high reward. Stunning XP, great drops.

    How is that, again? By not running, and all /assisting. That's not a
hard lesson to learn. Root parking and various ghetto mezzing techniques? I
see those happen more often outdoors, where groups that DON'T have all the
usual classes can be consistently successful and therefore form. So
seriously: tell us what those "hardnose dungeon explorers" do. I'm curious.

    Yeah, I frequently make fun of others to make myself feel good about
what few skills I have.

    Um, did you read what I wrote? I never DID those things. I grew up in
dungeons, or dungeon-like zones, just like I imagine all the pre-Kunark
crowd did. Took me twice as long to hit 60 as someone who went the outdoors
route, easy. And in the end, on a raid, you can't tell us apart because
raiding is so damn different from XP grouping in terms of strategies. So
what the hell did I gain? I can sure quantify what I lost - all the time
raiding, and the loot that goes with it, that the outdoor player got.

>I mean, ToV I will give you,

    Don't make me twist your arm. :P

>but Velks and Hate are hardly raid zones.

    Depends on who you're with, now doesn't it? Pre-Kunark, Hate was a
serious raid. Why not now? Levels and gear. Well, as shocking as it may
seem, people below level 55 raid Hate, and they don't all have 'leet gear
(part of the reason they're in Hate, I imagine). They have to do a LOT of
the same damn things that ToV group does - they can afford to be a bit more
zerglike, but not by much. To them, it's a raid.

>Now you seem to be getting a little out of shape cos I aimed a general rant
>at Jakugg

    No, I ranted back because you don't have a clue about this. You
perpetrate the myth of "l33t dungeon skills" even though in the end, it
makes no difference. I know at least one rogue in our server's top guild
(cleared Vulak/Vyemm recently so they CAN be called an uberguild still) who
did all his XP outdoors whenever possible, flew to 60, and is now considered
one of the best rogues in the guild. Wasn't an alt (like most of them), he
was a primary. He KNEW that the path to glory is to level to 60 ASAP, get in
that top guild, and raid raid raid to rack up the gear.

> even though he is a decent guy but Im an officer in a big guild,

    It didn't show. :P

>Im in charge of tactics and Ive been around a long time. And im sick to

    Yup, me too. But I see those same newbies in Sol B with my alts, making
the same mistakes. Or in Sebilis, like the wizard that thought snaring was
inferior to just blasting things dead when they turned to run. Being in a
dungeon doesn't make them any smarter, it just kills them more. And when
they get to 60, and they WILL get there, they will have to learn many things
all over again.

>I'm even more fed up of people who think they want to raid after

>for it

    THIS, I can see. Players that level up fast enough frequently don't
realize exactly how much time a raiding guild will demand you put in, that
being every second you're online. They think that raiding glory will be
theirs just as quickly as levelling was, not doing the math on drops/day and
players on the raid. Dungeon levelling MIGHT teach them one thing: patience.
But more likely than not, the good players had that before they started
playing EQ.
