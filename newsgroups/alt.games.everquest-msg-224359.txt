    I dunno.   Did you communicate to him that it would be okay for him to jump
in?  People have asked you that a few times, and I haven't seen you answer it
(not that I've printed out this thread and gone over it with a highlighter or
anything).  Many people in this newsgroup have had bad experiences where they
jumped in and attacked in similar situations, only to hear a zone-wide barrage
of killstealing accusations leveled against them.  Might sound silly to you, I
know.  After all, _you'd_ never do such a thing.  But I doubt that mage had a
psychic link to your mind.  Unless you actually used /y or some other form of
communication like "Get it off get it off get it off!!!1!" or something, that
mage was  being polite, not rude.  Now, if you did call for help and he ignored
and let you die, then you might have a case.

   Personally, I think it's rude to expect other people to play guard for you. 
I know this is contrary to how much of the rest of the player base feels.  I
have been in situations where kind higher leveled people have been near where I
am hunting, gifting me with buffs and heals unasked for, and still died close to
their feet when I knew damned well they could and would gladly have saved me if
I had used /y.  Why?  Because I think it's rude to expect other people to play
guard for you.  More than once I've had to explain this, and I get the feeling I
might be alone in this way of thinking.
