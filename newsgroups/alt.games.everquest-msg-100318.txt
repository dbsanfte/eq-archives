that is in spotless condition and when you pull up to a red light do
you get steaming mad if someone pulls up next to you and looks at your
car? Maybe they are standing around "inspecting" it when you come out
of a store. Do you freak and tell them to stop looking at your car or
do you show a kinship for those who would appreciate what it took for
you to come across such a beauty? when people see some spiffy looking
armor or awesome looking weapon and they inspect you just take it as a
compliment. If you are dressed in rags and they inspect you then maybe
theyre gonna give you something theyve outgrown. I do that to see if i
am giving something to a needy newbie not to some well equipped
beggar.

just my 2cp.

(actually i would prefer a '68 GTO)
