Another FYI. Going through Beholder's Maze and saw a wood elf druid<?>
running with 3 minotaurs in tow. Thinking he was in trouble I ran after him.
He drug the mino's to the zone line where there was a heavily twinked high
elf cleric waiting.

Soon as he got to the cleric he stopped and she thumped each of them a time
or two and they attacker her. The druid backed off a bit and cast a damage
shield on her, then sat down to me.

The cleric was mostly wiffing, I think the druid only had to get up once
during the fight to cast a heal. First mino falls, as it is falling the
other two start running => almost 100% of the damage done was from the
damage shield. Cleric is still at full mana, so a couple of strikes and the
other two mino's are out.

Now this would not be a big deal except for the fact the cleric was only
level 16 and managed to solo 3 mino's at once using the technique.

Torn between thinking a level 16 cleric soloing 3 mino's is just too good
and wishing someone would do it for my low level characters.
