What zone is that one character camped in?  Is it different from the
others?  It may be a port blocking problem with the port used to
connect to that zone.

If that's not it, it may be corrupt .ini files -- back up your .ini
files for that character and have the game re-create new ones fresh.
You'll have to reset your windows, hotkeys, etc. but that's what the
back up is for, so you still have the data around to try to put back
one piece at a time until you find out what's breaking it.
