Even ignoring random letter combinations:

Graeme = 260050 = 26500
Karen = 20605 = 26500

It just seems like a terrible solution to be honest.

Their random name generator does at least seem to be different based on 
race already.  I'd be happy with a solution that uses a random name 
generator personally, but many would not.
