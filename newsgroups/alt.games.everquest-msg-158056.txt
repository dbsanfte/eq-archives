Yes its really easy. Its on the back of the CD you PURCHASE. Actually
- not long ago, Verant was giving out key codes to new accounts to
existing players that they could use themselves or give to friends. It
was just to the basic (or as they call it "classic") game - the old
world. This ended however a few months ago. Altho you can buy the
basic cd for like 10 bucks (not sure of costs or availability outside
of the US).
