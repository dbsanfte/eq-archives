This is a very old issue, and never have been resolved and I doubt it ever
will.

If I was role-playing, I would use /shout if I wanted to talk to everyone in
a zone and have it in character...
I would use /ooc for (*gasp* ) out of character comments...
/auc wouldn't be used at all

If I wasn't role-playing I would use it the way you said...

Just depends on the person about how each channel should be used
