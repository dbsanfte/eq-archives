Won't happend, GM allways talks to you first confirming that you are still
interested in going.
Also they generally will not transport you unless you are on a dock, and as
i recall there are few docks with oceancoing ships on them in the Karanas.

I was headin for FV with my warrior the other day after a brief visit to
Freeport and sat down in the docks
and petitioned, it was early in the morning EST so i guess no GM or guide
was online yet so i gave up waiting after
about 20 minutes and logged on my druid who was hunting in FM at the time.
After some half hour of hunting the
Kromdek scum i got a tell from a guide asking me if i still needed a ride :)
I declined and said i will call later when
i log on my warrior again.  When i finally logged my warrior again it took
me all of 5 minutes to get from FP to
FV (quite a timesaver not having to wait for both boat AND shuttle in BB :)
