Doing that right now though in EQ's ruined "horse" economy would break
you though. I see totally the opposite now on the tribunal server,
everyone wants to sell HIGH and no one wants to even trade for items
of equal or lesser value. Horses have fuxxored things up bad.

Have you tried this much since horses are in? Also why are you not on
my server? Even before horses were in I could not sell jack crap even
at half price. I'd have loved to have someone like you to sell to
then. I can't think how many times I've dressed the POD up in
blackened crystilline robes because no one even offered me 200 plat
for them. When the only offer I get is "my FBR and SERPENTINE BRACER,
PLZ ITS GUD!" that is when the POD is wearing it.

I'd do that if anyone wanted to spend the time selling my stuff. If
they got an excess amount they could even lie about it and pocket
some.

Actually I think you could probably be banned from EQ for setting up a
gambling game AT ALL. The exact reason that verant did not put
gambling into EQ is because of the value that EQ plat eventually
reached. With horses that value is MORE. Because EQ plat has a real
world value (though greatly depreciated) they recognized that
basically it would be REAL WORLD gambling. So if they don't want this
in their game themselves for that reason they probably don't want you
doing it either.

I've never given a thing to anyone who asked me and have put several
of them on ignore. Many of them don't see the huge difference between
offering 20 bone chips for 5 plat (which any newb can collect pretty
fast) in auction or just coming up to me and begging for 5 plat.

Yeah I've seen tailors try to sell backpacks for 100 plat but I don't
get it. Who would buy a 10 slot 10 percent weight reducing bp for 100
plat when you can fill your bank with toolboxes which are cheap and if
you need just one ok reducing bag you may as well buy an evil Eye one
with 70 percent weight reduction (constantly sold) for 300 plat or
less. A funnier thing is that on my server the ones who try to sell
them for 100 plat only offer 15 plat for the HQ bear skins, ahaha.
