My wizard dinged 40 yesterday while fighting the giants in Rathe Mountains,
so being a little bored I decided to evac to South Ro and see if I could see
an ancient cyclops.  Sat on a hill south of the evil merchants camp trying
to conserve mana as much as possible but still blasting anything that came
by.  Some things required my highest dd but some others could be taken out
with something less.  Then the clops popped.  He was kinda close to me but
not within aggro.  I was down 2 bubbles of mana so I was thinking I probably
didn't have enough.  But to med would probably mean that someone else would
get him before I could.  So I figured I might as well take him down as far
as I can just to see how tough he is.   Bonds of force, blast, blast, blast,
etc.  Got him with my last bubble and didn't even have to harvest.  Whoot!
Now I go to hunt the shadowmen.
