THANK YOU for reading my post & realizing that.  I wasn't trying to get
pissy or sound as if I was, I just hate seeing anyone ask a question about
using some software & get responces where the user should have preceeded the
subject line with "AD:".  I specifically asked (paragraph 2, 2nd & 3rd
sentences):
"Since now ALT+TAB gives the "crash to desktop" effect (EQ COMPLETELY closes
since you can't get back in anyway), has anyone experimented with using this
as a way to program EQ to close at a certain time?  This is useful if you're
in the Bazaar as a vendor, and need some automated process done while you're
AFK, such as recording a TV show with your capture card."

Also the 3rd through 5th & the last words/abreeviations of the subject were
apparently ignored as well.

However thank you for being the first to actually read the original post &
back me up here.  Apparently 3 others, even though I'm sure I stated things
VERY clearly (especially the subject) did not pay attention.
