One thing I learned when Asheron's Call first came out was that in OE, if
you did a filter to block out "AC" posts, it'd block ANY post with the
letters A and C together.  NOT good. :p

Luckily with DAOC there's not likely to be a problem adding "Camelot" and
"DAOC" to my filter. :)

This isn't AT ALL a flame to those who start threads like this one...it's
just my personal thought that I don't give a shit about the differences or
similarities.  I come to a.g.eq to read about EQ, not some other game.  But
lots of others ENJOY those posts, so keep 'em coming.  I love filters...we
all win. :)
