That raises an interesting question: what should count as a city when
tallying up cities that were left out?

Katta, Seru, Kael, and Skyshrine clearly.

Other candidates that come to mind:

1. Highpass
2. Runnyeye (unless we want to count it as sharing the Rivervale port)
3. Centaurs
4. Aviaks in both SK and TD
5. Kerrans
6. I seem to recall a city or village in Stonebrunt.
7. Kedge

One could argue that some of these are too small to justify a port, but
Rivervale is pretty small, too.  Rivervale might be justified as being the
home city of the Halflings, so it gets one...but that argument also should
work for the Centaurs.

Another thing common to all the places with ports is banks, so by that
criteria, I think only Katta, Seru, Kael, Skyshrine, Highpass, and Runnyeye
are missing.
