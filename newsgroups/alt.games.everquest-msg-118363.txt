I'd be happy if they just let us do it on the boats without all this
adjusting where you're standing nonsense so that you're in just the right
space. I have noticed that while the boat is at the dock, I can fish fine;
but I'm SOL as soon as it moves. I can't remember the last time I was able
to successfully fish while on the boat.
