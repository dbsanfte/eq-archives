How about a "created" race/class like a Golum, which would look like the GoD
mob on the patcher splash screen. You would be summoned by a NPC mage.

The Golum race would not equip clothing and armor in the conventional sense.
It would have upgraded body parts which would be created by other casting
player classes. The body parts would be installed by clerics and perhaps be
fused with normal items for stats.

The toon would have perhaps three different versions for body combinations.

The Golum would be a slow dumb, non casting tank which would deal a big bash
with its fists.

Other preferences would include the orc or perhaps a Centaur (rather than
Minataur) Perhaps the Centaur could shape shift into someother form as I am
sure a quadraped character would be impracticle in some zones. It would be
rather fun to be able to carry players on the Centaurs back too.
