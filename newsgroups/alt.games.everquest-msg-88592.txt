I think it depends on how you play. I tend to not eat around the
computer so for all the sitting I do I've probably actually
lost/maintained my weight while playing. I tend instead to drink water
or coffee or diet caffiene soda drinks.

I should get out and walk around more anyway since I'm not actually
LOSING weight and I could be thinner.
