From my observations, Riposte does not "reverse the damage" of the
incoming attack.  What it does is (a) block any damage to you and
(b) give you a free extra attack against your attacker.  The extra
attack is not even guaranteed to hit, plus it can still be blocked
or otherwise avoided.  (I'm not sure if it can be riposted.)  If
it does hit, it does your usual damage, including possible procs.

I'm not enough of a raider to understand first-hand how Rampage works.
That part of the FAQ predates me. :-)  But my assumption was that you
don't actually have to be at the top of the hate list to get onto the
rampage list, you just have to get on the hate list at all.  So if the
MT attacks, then the ST attacks, they should both be on the rampage
list.  I don't know whether FD etc. take the puller off the list.

Maybe someone with some direct experience can fill us both in?
