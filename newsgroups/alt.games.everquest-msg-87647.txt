I saw nothing of the sort on the Raithe.  I was trying to run my poor level
4 Inky over to Kaladim to turn in bonechips (great xp at that level), and
wound up getting pushed off the boat while it -tried- to zone.  I swam back
to the Docks and had just barely gotten on dry land when it gave me the
disconnected message (Black Screen of Death?).  I saw nothing about the
world servers coming down.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
