Sure why not and to add to this lets make spells so they cannot be casted on
lower level players (just use the same formula as the exp 1.5 times your
level). for spells like SOW make them where speed is deterimined by the
reciver instead of the caster just like SOW Poitions, and varible spells
like breeze and clarity are timied by the reciver. You can't be power
leveled, yes a high level healer may be casting a low level heal spell on
you for an almost unlimited time but will never get a chance to med.  This
will screw things up enough so everyone will quit makeing new characters.
Yes I will twink my character to the best of my ability. I have taken 2
characters up from the start without twinking or PL for the most part why do
it again.
