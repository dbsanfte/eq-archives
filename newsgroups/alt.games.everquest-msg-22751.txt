J- or T-Boots make a *huge* difference.  As a fellow rogue, it's one of my
favourite modes of transportation.  I just wish I knew *exactly* where I'd
zone into Grobb, Ogguk, or Neriak so that I had the confidence to zone into
those cities without my mask up.  Plus, I'm too cheap (and stubborn) to buy
Invis Potions.
