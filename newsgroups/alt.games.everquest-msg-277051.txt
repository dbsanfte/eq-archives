So, the server I've been on basically since the beginning (I started a
character on another server, then switched to Rodcet when it opened with the
second wave of servers), the last non-split "old school" server, will soon
be no more.

Do I get the joy of being on the same server as bizbee or DT?  I know Rodcet
Nife's brand of "friendly" competition would be a huge hit with those two...

Among the more serious players, any of you from Quellious?

I've learned a lot about Quellious over the past few days, and it sounds
like a slightly nicer version of Rodcet Nife so there should be few
problems.  Looking at some of the other mergings, with one server having had
a rotation in effect and honored for years merging with another server that
is pure free-for-all, I think I'll definitely miss out on some fireworks
since both Rodcet and Quellious are free-for-all.  =)
