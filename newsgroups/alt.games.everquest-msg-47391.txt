6 mins

click on Abilities, pick an empty spot, select mend, push the button

I believe you have to train it, been so long since I've played my monk, but
I'll assume you trained it... its a passive skill, so all you gotta do is
keep jumping and the damage is reduced on its own. What I did to get my
skill up was go to the shaman/SK guild, take the teleport to the upper
floor, jump (yes jump, get some extra height), hit the ground, repeat

Yep, they show in abilities too

You dont have 1hs, all you got is hand to hand, 1hb and 2hb. Keep your
punching up, and I would recommend training some 1hb on your way up

get a lot of mend, and if you want, 1hb, or hand to hand if skill is still
low

stay away from the scaled wolf things for a little bit... theyre MEAN
