Not KOS in the Bazaar.  My agnostic DE mage is not KOS in any of the
places in Shadowhaven that he has visited, but he did not explore much
in there.

Use invis to go through Highpass.  You could kill orcs or gnolls there
as you level to bceome non-KOS to the people in High Pass.  Turn in
the scalps for faction too.  My DE mage is amiable and only spent 2
levels there.  EXP was quick.

They were threateningly still after killing a lot of Runnyeye goblins.
Guess the mage needs to kill more or give up on gaining faction with
the dwarf guards.
