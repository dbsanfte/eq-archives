A) Not everyone who can quad can root/rot.  My wizard doesn't get
any DoTs.

B) The mobs I'm killing have roughly 2400 hit points and each give
approximately 1% of the XP required to level.  Quadding, that's
two snares (75 mana AoE snare which has to be applied twice due to
the short duration) and 12 casts of Circle of Force (175 mana for
216 damage on each of the four mobs.)   That's four kills for a
mana cost of 2250.  With single kills, I get one snare (75 mana)
and four casts of Conflagration (622 damage for 250 mana) per kill.
That's four kills for a mana cost of 4300 (1075 each.)  As I said,
given a choice between spending 4300 mana and 2250 (just over half
the mana!) for four kills, it's an easy choice.  (As a side note,
that's a wizard using the only viable AoE spell (CoF) at 47 which
is a level 34 spell.  A level 44 spell, if available, would be
even better.  Depending on how mob hit points progress, I'd expect
an even larger difference in efficiency at 51 when the next viable
AoE spell is available.)

C) KEI has made a *major* difference in mana regen, especially for
"active" characters like people quadding or hybrids.  That's 14
mana/tick standing or sitting.  Over a four minute quad, that's
an additional 560 mana even without sitting down.  Throw in PotG
for another six mana/tick and you're effective sitting down even
while quadding as compared to being without KEI.  And (obviously)
mana regen skyrockets when sitting so downtime isn't as big an
issue as it was pre-KEI.  I simply can't imagine how bad leveling
a wizard pre-KEI was, both in terms of extra mana pool for safety
and downtime incurred.

D) Root/rot is a valid strategy as long as we're still talking KEI'd
character and multiple mobs.  Necros are the 'gods' of soloing
because of their ability to do that, of course, especially due to
their ability to regain mana quickly.  I'd guess a comparable necro
doing root/rot could level as fast or faster, probably even doing
single mobs due to their lack of any real downtime and their ability
to hunt successfully in dungeons with XP bonuses.
