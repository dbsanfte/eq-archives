You're welcome!
IMHO, I would generally advise against soloing in HHP in the two main camps
at each end of the zone.  I found that if you're in a group, and it gets to
be less than five people, things don't work as efficiently.  If it gets to
less than four people, then the cleric has to start nuking instead of
healing (gotta kill mobs as quick as possible before the next add-on
comes...).

The thing with HHP's main camps is that add-ons spawn frequently, so you get
times where the mobs are flowing in.  With a full and/or well-balanced
group, it's timed just right to eat them up.  With less than that, you're
taking risks.  Those are at the main Highpass camps at both ends of the
zone, especially the Orc Camp.

Soloing in HHP?  My cleric has done it, but it's not efficient.  There's a
second gnoll camp few folk use that a soloer or small group (2-3) can fight.
It's in the pathways near the Tiger's Roar Inn in the middle of the zone.
Be prepared for an occasional guard or Highpass citizen to jump in and steal
the kill from you (which also means watch out on using Area Effect spells!)
But with Snare/root, that can make the job much easier.

The plus side of this camp is, if you get in real trouble, the Highpass
citizens aren't that far away, and are more than eager to beat on the local
gnolls....plus the Tiger's Roar is right there to sell your loot at and med
in safety.  I imagine there are more efficient places for a druid to solo,
but you might find the locale fun for a change of pace.... And if you ding,
then Rivervale isn't that far away for your spells and training.

Oh, and my cleric also solo'd Dillyn Starsine for the Testament of Vanear
quest, but I wouldn't recommend doing that more than once or twice, as the
faction hits for the bad guys in Qeynos are massive.  You wouldn't want to
meet Lt. Dagerok in the wrong mood in a dark alley behind Crow's Casino next
time you visit Qeynos.....

Last word of advise about Highpass:  get a map from www.eqatlas.com   ... it
is a maze in there, and easy to get lost your first few dozen times through
there....
