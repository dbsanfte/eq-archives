The Holy Spirit left the earth I believe sometime on the first day of this
year, that means that Satan and his demons are allowed to enter people who
have no love for God and use them with no restraint from God at all, this is
second stage and second set of plagues of the last days, the first of which
started in 1966 with the great deception, the second started the 1st of this
year with the removal of the Holy Spirit, and the third will start in around
3.5 years with the removal of the church.
