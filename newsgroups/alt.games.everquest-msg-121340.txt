I have, Bizbee. The patch fixed the problem, but I see no reason to
beleive that the mixed up icons were the reason behind the emergency
patch. Or do you think the patch a while back that said it fixed some
spelling errors in the patch message was done because of those
spelling errors, too?

The emergency patch in question was almost definately due to the
fucked up petition queue.
