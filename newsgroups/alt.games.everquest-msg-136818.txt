If you think that is bad, I run a 19" monitor, about 18" away from me, play
EQ at 640x480, with /chatfontsize 5.  With the new UI I noticed that
/chatfontsize 6 is a noticeable difference above 5, so I use that now.

And if that's still not bad enough, I'm looking for a 21" or even maybe a
23" if cost is low enough with good quality.
