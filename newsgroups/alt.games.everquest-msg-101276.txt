Yes, pretty much.  Sucks, but it's true.  The sad thing is that many of 
these are still great places to *bring a group*, most of the people going 
there aren't going to have a group to bring.

Get used to it.  There is always going to be some paranoid twit who 
accuses you of pick pocketting a mob.  If some gives you lip, explain how 
pick pocket works.  If they don't like it, write them off.

As to why should you work on it?

You need a decent skill for doing your epic.  That's basicly it.  And yes, 
if you plan on continuin to play the rogue in the 50+ levels, you DO need 
to get your epic.
