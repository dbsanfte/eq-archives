No offense taken, of course...

Here's why it's an amiguous question:

1) How much XP do you get from killing a light blue mob in EQ?

At least in my experience, that drastically changes based on level.
An EQ level 20 killing a light blue gets more XP (in perceived
gain) than a level 65 killing a light blue, right?

So, here's a perfectly legitimate answer:  killing blue mobs (not
light blue) in EQ2 is better XP than killing deep red mobs in EQ.
Why? Because you can kill three mobs and gain most of a level...
(Of course, you're level *2* in EQ2 compared to, say 70, in
EQ, but the question didn't specify levels...)

2)  Now you're going to specify levels.   Well, no, you aren't.  :D
Level is just a "number" -- it doesn't mean anything on its own.
Yes, you have some points where level is meaningful across the
two games:   level 1 in both and level 50 (EQ2) to level 70 (EQ.)
Level 1's in both are super XP getters with limited skills.  The
upper levels in both can kill all the boss mobs (assuming raids
and gear anyway.)   So - Is 1-50 the same as 1-70?   Maybe,
but that would mean each level in EQ is worth 1.4 EQ levels,
so you'd need to compare an EQ2 level 20 to an EQ level
28.  But even that assumes an equal power curve, something
I've got no reason to believe is true.   There's not an even
curve in EQ, at least in my experience -- hitting certain levels
(depending on class) is WAY better.   (Like an enchanter
moving from 59 to 60, for instance -- KEI is VASTLY
superior to C2 -- or a cleric from 38 to 39 -- hello, CHeal..)

At any rate, it's meaningless without certain assumptions,
none of which anyone (outside of Sony anyway) has any
actual knowledge.   So -- let's say you have to kill 100
light blue mobs to move from 18 to 19 in EQ -- and 100
orange mobs to move from 18 to 19 in EQ2.   That's
bad, right?  But what if the gain in power means you
bypassed -- in world context -- the power the person
in EQ has?   In EQ2, you get an ability every level (or
more.)  In EQ, you get them every four levels or so.
So does moving from EQ2 18 to 19 mean the same
as moving from EQ 18 to 22?

At any rate, as I said, I'm not sure how to begin to even
interpret the question -- too many unknowns.  EQ2 does
so many things differently than the way EQ does.  You
really can't compare them, at least in a meaningful,
numeric manner...
