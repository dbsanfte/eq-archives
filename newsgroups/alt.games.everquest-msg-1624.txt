Level 41 Ranger, currently equipped as follows:

Ear:  two 3AC 8 dis earrings
Neck:  collar undead prot.
Face:  grotesque mask
Head:  crown of froglock kings
Ring1: Jagged band
Ring2:  5AC 55HP
Bracers: two Ivy etched
Hand: Ivy etched
Arm: Ivy etched
Chest: Ivy etched
Legs: Ivy etched
Shoulders: crested spaulders
Back: Lizardscale cloak
Belt: Strawspun
Feet: Dwarven workboots
Weap1: Electrum bladed Wakizashi
Weap2: Blackjack

I want to replace the earrings with Cougar Claw, the Neck with a Ry'gor
chain collar, and the face with a Sarnak hide mask.

Any advice as to how to upgrade the rest of the items?  Armor first over
wepons?  Or spend it all on a Swarmcaller?

Thanks
