}Yeah I get that too. :p I know how you feel, I used to play a game
}called Nexus: Kingdom of the Wind which was a nice game if you like to
}roleplay, which I didn't. I came back after a while of now playing
}(keep in mind this game has an average of 800 people online, 1 server
}total) and all my characters were gone. They allow people to download
}the game and create newbies for free, but they could just delete the
}newbies instead of everyone who hasn't paid up their protection money
}for their damn characters.

Err... I'm confused here, are you saying they should delete potentially 
active newbie characters rather than the characters who haven't been 
played in months?

}EQ has a lot more people playing but they
}can't have newbie spam characters because you have to spend money
}before you can even log into a server.

Well.  That's not strictly true.  IGN has had an offer for a while now 
that allows you an account for one month free, and to download the 
original game.

(Dunno if that link still works... it sure doesn't work in Irix Netscape 
4. :) )

Also, the only confirmed incident (post beta, not on the test server) of 
characters being deleted was a year or so ago when they wiped ONLY level 
one characters that had not been played in over a month.

}There is no reason to delete
}characters unless the damn game goes bankrupt, filling up a huge
}server HD does not cost them more money, they don't use the same HD's
}to hold the zone info and game info as they do to hold the character
}info so in they end they just clear out character files probably in
}the hopes that being that the high level end of the game is very
}boring so starting over might addict them to the game again. That's
}the only thing I can figure because I can tell you from experience,
}when my characters are gone that game loses my buisness for good after
}working on them so long.

This being the only reported incident of anyone's high level characters 
disappearing that has not yet been shown to be an accidental bug, I would 
venture to suspect that it's an accidental bug.

Even if it isn't, I do think Verant is entirely free to charge a storage 
fee for your character information, even if it -is- less storage than is 
available in an old Atari 2600 game cartridge.  The fact is, though, most 
evidence seems to suggest that they don't.

}With so many MMORPGs coming out when they
}find their characters are gone they will goto DAoC, AO, UltimaOnline,
}AC2 and all the rest plus any of the other new ones I failed to
}mention because there are so damn many. If you decide to play DAoC by
}the way to try something different I'll be Liveye a Wizard on the
}Merlin server when I get my copy. Good luck to you...

...

Liveye?

Like in, Liveye that I hunted tons o' wurms with in GD?

Dude, Whassuuuup! :) Welcome to the house o' flame.
