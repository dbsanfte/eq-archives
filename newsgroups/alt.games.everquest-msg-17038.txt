im new to the whole Iskar area FoB and Kurns tower and the like. Well me and
2 others made it to what appeared to be the top. it was a room with some
tables and 3 doorways that are blocked by rocks. i walked up to the rocks
and ducked down and looked through. sure enough there was a passageway back
there. so anyone know whats back there? how much do shrink potions cost? or
what level do shammys get the spell?
