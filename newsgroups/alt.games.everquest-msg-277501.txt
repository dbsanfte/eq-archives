Easiest way: create a new toon on the other server you're merging to
and send an email.  If it bounces your name is probably not used on
that server.  If it goes through, you have a dupe name and pray the
person recieving the email is friendly and can work with you in
advance of the merger (ie fighuring who has the most played time,
warning about recieving mistells due to changed names)

This way you can have one toon cover up to 8 possible conflicting
names.  I'm not going to worry if my bazaar mule got an x in her name
as she almost never leave Bazaar anyway.
