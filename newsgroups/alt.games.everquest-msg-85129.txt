What I can never figure out, is why people powerlevel in popular spots, such 
as Crushbone, Oasis, etc.  when they could go somewhere out of the way and get 
an equalt number or even more spawns, like the Orc Camps in Rathe Mountians 
(that even have a nearby pally camp to run to if things get out of hand) for 
one example.
