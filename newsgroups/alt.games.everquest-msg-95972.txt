Slaughter kobolds in the Warrens until you con apprehensive to the skeleton
guards in the Paineel newbie yard. This will take the longest amount of time, as
you need to kill many hundred; the good news is you'll get positive faction in
Paineel AND Erudin. Collect about 24 kobold molars along the way.

When you get to apprehensive have someone let you into Paineel and show you to
the Palace. Give 4 molars at a time to Royal Guard Likus; you'll get a huge
faction boost and probably some ringmail. Keep giving him molars, 4 at a time,
until you con amiable. You'll take some faction hits in Erudin but you can
afford them at this point (I did this and they still consider me an ally).

Go back out to the one of the skeleton guards in the Paineel newbie yard and say
"I need key" and he'll hand you one.
