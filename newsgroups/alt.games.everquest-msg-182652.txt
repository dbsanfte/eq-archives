Logs don't mean jack and GMS don't interfere in such "group drop"
disputes anyway. Its your job to cement how drops are being dropped
and insist upon rolling on them AS they drop. So when the first FT3
boots dropped, you should have said "lets roll on those boots."

If they made no response, you should have again said "lets roll on
those boots. " If at that point nothing happened, you should have quit
doing your job in the group be it healing/tanking or whatever and said
"lets roll on those boots." until they made it plain that they were
not going to be rolled on. At that point you should have immediately
left.

Always insist on finding out how loot is being done at the START of
grouping, then simply leave if you don't like it. You are spending
time there like everyone else and deserve your fair chance of a
reward. The only time that it might be different is if you were with
some people who were SPECIFICALLY going to get someone something in
particular ahead of time. Even in that case, only ONE pair of boots
should have been reserved and once again you should have been told it
AHEAD OF TIME (prior to even going to the dungeon.)

Once again though, GMS will do nothing. I don't really think they
should either, its a player domain thing.
