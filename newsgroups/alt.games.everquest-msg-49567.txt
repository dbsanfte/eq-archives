And oddly, the way to make me wonder how truly pathetic I am. <g>. On
our first night away from Norrath, playing the Real World zone, we went
out with two of our friends for dinner and drinks, and upon arriving
back home the four of us sat down in the living room, chatting, and
flipped on the TV. What was on TNN? Yep. A Star Trek: TNG marathon. Ok,
we only watched one episode, but it was one of the very early ones, back
before Tasha Yar quit the show to go do naked modeling.
