The aforementioned Burning Woods is a good option, though I personally hate
the zone.

Scarlet Desert (not on the plateau), Dawnshroud peaks, and Bloodgill Goblins
in LoIO are all good options, I also saw a necro of similar level range
(anon, but blue to 54 and 53) soloing guardians in Skyshrine (without a
pet).
