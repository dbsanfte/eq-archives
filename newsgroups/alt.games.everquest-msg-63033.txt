Fear is incredibly unforgiving, always expect a guild's first attempt to be
a disaster.  I have a two bothched Fear breaks under my belt now, about 21
hours standing naked in the Feerott, and a level and a half of lost
xp.  That was our first two attempts, we had to call in higher level guilds
to rescue us each time.  Every Fear break since then has gone smoothly.

Depends on the zone and the guild.  Our Hate and Fear raids take about 6
hours now, although if we get Hate on a weekend we'll head up to the second
floor and spend 10 or 12 total.  Others do it faster, and we were much
slower when we first started (not many raids go into Hate with an average
level under 50 these days, it was quite a lot of fun).

Something like Sky can easily take three days to clear totally.
