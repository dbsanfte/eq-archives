Yep.  Warrior doesn't have the agro-grabbing spells of a Knight, but
you hit better.  So dual wielding fast weapons will hold agro unless
the Knight is for some reason trying to take it from you (only good
reasons are to spread hits around when xp'ing to maximize regen
benefit, to avoid Warrior dying when healer is oom, or if agreed to
in advance to give the Knight some Defense skill-up opportunities).

Sarnak Warhammer (30/40 2hb) is routinely under 150, often under 100,
on my server at least.

Affordable 1h weapons include the Guard Captain's Mallet, at 11/20
it'll outdamage a Centi LS by a good margin in your primary hand, and
I saw 4 of them for sale for under 4k in the bazaar today (Tunare
server).
