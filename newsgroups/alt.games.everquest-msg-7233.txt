 Well they just eliminated one way. There are still two other ways I
know of. One I have seen deomnstrated and one not.

 Enchanter in wolf (werewolf? not exactly sure which) form (apparently
non agro) Enthralls Phin, goes to the ledge and waits for thrall to
release. Phin arrives alone. This is good for at least single pulling
but I don't think the enchanter would have enough time to make it back
to the zone before phinny warped and started bonking him/her.

Call of the Hero technique: Necro/Ranger/Druid/Shaman gets an invis and
swims to Phin and casts a DoT on him. DoTter gets a CoH to the zone.
Aggro is cleared until the next tic of the DoT. Phin aggros, pops to
zone and summarily gets a beatdown.
