But you *do* play a game with people who buy their success.

The only thing we have to console ourselves is that these people are 
breaking the rules and cheating... Sony's ambivalent stance on the issue 
has never been encouraging, but until now they were never officially 
going to support it.

The good news is that it will drop the bottom out of the market. They 
don't have to macro or farm to get the items to sell so they can drive 
playerauctions bankrupt if they want.

The bad news is that like most of the people here, I won't be playing 
that EQ. Or any other title from that company.
