Nonsense.

Yes, that's true.

But that hardly makes tracking your faction hits "completely useless",
as you say.

On the contrary, tracking faction hits makes it possible to
determine, among other things, which faction hits are more valuable
than others, and by how much, by letting different players
compare how much of a /con change they got from different
combinations of numbers/types of faction hits, from which it becomes
easy to calculate which faction hits help/hurt more than others.

This is obviously very valuable information, and makes the way that
one plays the game "more effective or efficient", exactly as I said
in the part of my post that you quote above, which you erroneously
derided as "completely useless".

Log analysis can be used to change anecdotal evidence into hard facts
and solid numbers, and prove or disprove rumors and lore about
how the game works.

For example, my recent log analysis of my long task of getting
my Dwarf Paladin good Cabilis faction has proven that there's
a +2000 point max cap over base faction (a longstanding bit of
EQ lore), and disproved the rumor that getting killed by a
mob on faction XX will reset your base to your current
faction standing (another longstanding rumor).  These are both
very useful bits of information, which would have been impossible
to verify without complete logs and a detailed analysis of them.

"Completely useless"?  I think not.
