Have the same problem.

I have EQ installed on 2 PCs.  

1. AMD 1800+ (1533mghz) | 1gb memory | ProphetIII | VIA chipset
2. PentiumIII 1ghz | 512mg memory | ProphetIII | nVidia chipset

Both are running WindowsXP.
Both have identical IDE hard disks.  

PC #1 runs like a dream.  Has only crashed once while playing EQ.

PC #2 suffers the mysterious crashes exactly as you describe. 
Occasionally at first, but getting progressively worse.  Can't stay
logged in for more than 10 minutes now.  EQ files on that PC also
suffer frequent corrupting.


No idea what's causing it.
