Odd, I don't have chop problems in oldworld/Kunark/Velious on a
Celeron 700(ish) with only 384 PC100 RAM... And I'm even using about
2/3 of the new models. Given Shawn's post, it sounds like he's even
having chop in the oldworld zones.

Not sure how Radeon 8500 is. First Radeon card I bought was a bad
experience (Bad performance, the card totally puked when I tried to
install the official updated drivers. Took it back and got the GeForce
2 MX/MX400 I'm running now).
