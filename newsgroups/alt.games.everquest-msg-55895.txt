That is one use for a SK pet. Another is to use it as a DoT. Yes it will not
do as much damage as you do and from level 35 to 49 your pets become pretty
useless as a DoT. Starting at 52 I understand the pet starts to get better
again. All I need to do is kill about 500 more blues and I will be there. =)

SKs are very easy to solo when you get your darkness/fear line of spells.
Start getting into groups as early as possible and learn group tactics also.
No good to solo all the way only to come up short in the high levels when
you have no idea how to group with other classes.
