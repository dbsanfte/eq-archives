I have a faction problem that I am not sure how to deal with involving
a MQ. 


This is a Thurg quest for Chanpion Vams. Char No. 1 Is 54 a warrior
with good Coldain Faction This char has the gems required to complete
the Quest. Char No.2 is also a 54 Warrior with unacceptable Coldain
Faction, this char has the corroded arms. 

Improving Char 2's Coldain Faction is not an option.

My  thoughts on how to proceed are:

1. Have Char 1, the guy with the gems go to Capt N. 
    Have Char 2, the guy with teh corroded arms go to 
    Capt. N. Invisable
    Have Char 2 give the arms to Capt. N. Have Char 1 give CApt N. the
    gems..................Char 1 gets the Champion arms?????

2. Have Char 1 give Capt. N. one (1) gem
     Have char 2 (Invisable)give Capt. N. the corroded arms
     Have Char 1 give Capt. N. the othere two (2)..............Char 1 
     gets the Champion arms ?????

    This may be teh better of the two, since giving one (1) gem 
     establishes faction (?)

Anyone have thoughts on the feasability of these methods, or
suggestions on other methods?
