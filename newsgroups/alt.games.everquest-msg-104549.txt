Dedicate your time to learning to play your character properly, forget
tradeskills for now.

You have enough to do keeping arcane skills (conj, evo, etc) up-to speed as
you level.

The components required to do tradeskills are expensive to you at 7, but the
cost will be minimal when you're 45....and you'll welcome the diversion more
at higher levels.

With the exception of a few VERY high-end player-crafted items, the stuff
isn't worth the time anymore.

(Save as many points as possible to do spell research, and don't train in
the first point until you absolutely HAVE to.  Your starting skill is your
level when you trin in your first point, so if you train 1 point at 16, you
start at 17.  If you train 1 point at 20, you start at 21.  Dump training
points in until it won't allow you to train anymore.
