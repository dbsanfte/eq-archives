People feel betrayed when they find out you've knowingly allowed them to 
form serious misconception. If you're roleplaying a female elf, that's 
just fine.

However, if your playing the sort of female elf that says "Thanks babe, 
your my big strong protector!" /em Kisses X the Barbarian -- to the male 
barbarian warrior in the group... Well the *vast number of people* who 
may not "get" that you're roleplaying, and are not roleplaying 
themselves will take such a message as a sort of direct cyber-flirt 
between two people, with the genders implied by avatar gender.

That's not fair to them, and its dishonest, and if you're doing that, 
yeah, that's pretty perverse if you ask me. Plus if they respond in 
kind, and you have the slightest suspician that they're directing 
they're responses at *you* and not at the *female elf* then your leading 
them on, essentially setting them up to feel betrayed and humiliated. 
Yeah I think that's pretty sick.

The OP said the perpetrator led his guild to beleive he was a female. A 
statement like that *only* makes sense if the perpetrator led his guild 
to beleive *HE* was a female... after all if he was merely "playing" a 
female, it wouldn't be worth the time to write it down... creating a 
female avatar on its own is about as benign as creating a 'troll' 
avatar. It only becomes malignant if you perpetrate ooc misconceptions, 
and lead people on, especially people who consider themselves your 
friend... IE guild members you've grouped with for 2+ years.

Not what I'm saying at all.

It sure is.

It was intended as implied. I said "He pretended to be a female"... not 
he "played a female character". Perhaps it was too subtle a distinction.
