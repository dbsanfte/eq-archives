I looked at it the first time he posted it but I didn't see a server name 
or and IRC channel name. There *was* a suspiciously placed chuck of garbled 
text so I just assumed it was encrypted in some manner and overwhelming 
laziness took over. :-) (I did learn the idiot can't spell though.)

But yeah, in theory we could pick it apart. Maybe I overlooked something 
obvious. I'll take another peek and see if I can find anything.
