How far do you plan on taking this trio? If it's just for screwing
around for fun together through the first twenty or thirty levels, then
it won't matter. You can play pretty much anything since you already
have *some* melee capacity and a cleric. Druid would be great for
snaring and transportation later on. Shammy has good buffs and can also
SoW like the druid. But if you think you might all stick together and
hunt together into the high levels, then neither of them is a great
choice. Personally, I'd start a chanter to play with them. It would suck
at the low levels for a while, but later on when you come into your own,
you'll be able to hunt in a surprising variety of areas with just the
three of you. And when the SK is no longer a good enough tank for your
needs in tough post fifty areas, you'll have no difficulty picking up a
warrior if you already have a chanter and a cleric. Something to think
about anyway. Not nearly enough high end chanters out there.
