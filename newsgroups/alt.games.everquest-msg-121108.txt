Finally got the Luclin expansion. Finally able to enter Nexus and the Bazaar. :) 
My questions are about the Face button. When I press it for my Iksar Monk I get
a message saying I can't alter pre-Luclin grapics yet when I press it for my
Wood elf Bard I can change his face. Does this mean I can't change the face of
my Iksar?

On the subject of my Bard, great to see he holds a drum now, When I changed his
hair style his hair was white. Do all elves now have white hair?

Finally, I'm not sure if this is due to Luclin or not, my Monk seems to know a
language called Combined. What is this language? Where'd it come from?

Thanks in advance.

Cheers Watchman. :)
