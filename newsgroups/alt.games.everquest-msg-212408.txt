}Oops, look like omnipotent-omniscience is inconvenient all round.

Heh, was waiting for the 'create a rock He cannot lift' argument. :)  But 
the thing is, if God is omnipotent, I mean, truly TRULY omnipotent, then 
surely he's powerful enough to not get stuck in a silly paradox.  
Similarly, if he's -really- omniscient, he knows how to create a universe 
that he knows everything about, but still has inhabitants with free will.  
Just because we can't eff how he did it, doesn't mean he can't have done 
it.

We already know that our knowledge of the universe and how it works has 
limits.  It's that lovely Heisenberg thing, where you can't observe the 
universe without altering it by the very act of observation.  God is not 
bound by that criterion, but we are.  So the best we can do is create 
probability functions of where the electron might be at the moment and 
when it may have been there.  God actually knows where the electron is.

And it's quite possible our decisions are all predetermined, just a 
consequence of which electrons bounce which way across which synapses, and 
if we could measure all those electron positions, we could work out for 
ourselves what our decision would be.  But we can't.  Wasn't it clever to 
#include machine code in the source, so the silly interfering humans 
couldn't go around effing stuff He didn't want them to? (Yeah, ok, there's 
probably at least one person reading this newsgroup who hand-codes all his 
programs in raw binary.  Stop it!  You're screwing up a pretty metaphor!)

Poor Einstein.  Playing dice was probably the strongest evidence he could 
have hoped for that there was a God to do it.

Anyway.  The point is, the bugger's omnipotent, right?  So He bloody well 
-can- create a rock he can't lift if He wants to.  And He can lift it.

The thing that gets me, though, is the ridiculousness of the idea that any 
being that vast and powerful would care about the antics of a tiny, 
short-lived species of bipedal carbon-based lifeforms far out in the 
backwaters of a not particularly interesting spiral galaxy, that are so 
amazingly primitive they still think digital watches are a pretty neat 
idea.  We're so quick to think we're the center of the universe.  

He doesn't care what we do, we're just an object lesson for the 
Andromedans to learn from about the inherent moral wrongs of parking your 
planet too close to a sun. (See that scum that develops?  Carbon-based 
life... eww!  You want a nice clean shiny planet, you gotta park it out 
here where Neptune is, see?  Not as far as Pluto, then ya get comets.)
