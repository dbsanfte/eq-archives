Apart from that EQ actually work in fixing the errors. Daggerfall from 
release is the most bugged game i had the pleasure to play. As far as i 
know, they stopped fixing it, and still lots of errors (you know its bad 
when one of the official solutions to a problem are using cheats :)).

But its a good game, if you can live with the errors. I played almost 
nothing else for a months when i got it.

Unfortunately its 1 player only.
