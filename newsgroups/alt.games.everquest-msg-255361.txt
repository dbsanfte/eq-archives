If the server did actually crash (not the connection or any of the
other dozens of things that can happen) you'll be rolled back to your
last save. That is typically the last time you looted something,
zoned, completed a trade, toggled /roleplay, checked your ldon stats,
a few other things. For most people its usually when they zoned, and
they find themselves at the zonein point of the zone they were in.

All this time on Test is quite the teacher on what happens when
servers crash.
