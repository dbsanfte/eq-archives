Distance measured how?  This is what I'm trying to get at: distance is purely
relative, and without a shared measuring stick, there is no meaning to the
phrase "operate the same way".

That shared measuring stick could be "run speed in terms of
coordinate-units-per-realtime-second", or "archery distance using the same
bow" or "estimated height of an ogre".  It CANNOT be "real-world feet", as
there's no way to get a real-world item into the game to compare.

Your proposal would measure whether archery distance for a given weapon
differs from zone to zone.  That could have a DIFFERENT answer than whether
other measurements are the same.
