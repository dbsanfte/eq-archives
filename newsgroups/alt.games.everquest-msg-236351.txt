Here's the starting stats for a Froglok Cleric:

STR 75
STA 85
AGI 100
DEX 100
WIS 85
INT 75
CHA 50

And I put 25 into WIS and the remaining 5 into STR for:

STR 80
STA 85
AGI 100
DEX 100
WIS 110
INT 75
CHA 50

I know the STR is less than a Dwarf but not too bad compared to other 
races. STA is OK when you consider 100 AGI starting out I think. I'm not 
sure what DEX is good for with a Cleric. Can somebody tell me that? At 
110 for WIS I worry a little about having a smaller mana pool in lower 
levels until I get stat boosting items. Is the greater mana pool of a 
High Elf or Dwarf a really signifcant thing for the first 20 levels or 
so compared to this? I thought 75 INT was kind of nice in case I want to 
  do some crafting. CHA sucks but I'm not sure if this matters much.

Any comments on Froglok vs. High Elf vs. Dwarf?
