Not really....In fact the monk nerfs never affected me at all for example

 In the specific case of KEI and the group-buff

hmmm odd my lowbie chanter hasn't experienced this and any other groups I
have been in have only not taken one because we had one. Oh right .. mana
regen is all a chater does /tongue in cheek

> players expecting others to have KEI and refusing to group them if they
don't,

sheesh what crappy experiences you have had. Never seen this in any group I
have been in
I have seen folk shouting xyz class level has KEI and looking for group. The
class and level has been discussed in groups whether we want another never
OH BOY that player has KEI get him quick....

True this does affect my game play but this has happened for eons. Since the
game launched in fact.
Morons will always be morons. Has absolutely nothing to do with KEI

So .. what .. hasn't bothered me at all. If a smart player levels up fast
and plays smart in the group. GREAT !.
If the player never groups. So what. doesn't have anything to do with my
gameplay.
If the player is a moron. KEI or what ever won;t change that . The player
bothers my gameplay . Not the spell

> KEI has fucked

I completely and totally disagree. It is the best thing to ever hit the
game.
Well ok I lied. Stackable items and DNC items not poofing are the best.

Oh and continue the personal attacks. Its another fine attribute of the NERF
calling crowd.
I could care less. I don't play that game it's beneath me.
