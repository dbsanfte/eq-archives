the intial price does matter to those of us who dont have a money tree
growing in our back yard. When i went to buy a MMORPG. i went to the local
computer shop and saw Asherons Call and EQ and the shelf. I had already
decided on those 2 or maybe Ultima Online. The reason i picked Eq was it was
half the price of Asherons call and it had Kunark expansion thrown in as
well. so i said to myself. if i dont like the game then i have blown less
money then if i bought AC.
