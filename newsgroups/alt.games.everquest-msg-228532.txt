Hi There

Humm! Wait at newbie spawn point.

Preferably the Wood Elf one as most people cannot seem to use the race 
selector.

Cast choke and watch the pile grow until the newbies finally figure out 
when the off switch to the computer is.  As you always start to interact 
with the server before you gain control of your character.

Been there, seen it, died 6 times before I got  /quit excepted.

The only saving grace is that there might be a different person casting 
choke every time you come around. As the previous jerk may have been 
culled.

I agree with you what I saw of PvP the closest any of my so called 
'opponents' was 23 levels above me. They  wont care about points .

This seems a griefers paradise. I hope they build a big fence and throw 
away the key after they have got them all on board.
