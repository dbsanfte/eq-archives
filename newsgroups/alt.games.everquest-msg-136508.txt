Sure thing.  Guns, Pools, Aspirin, Kitchen Knifes, Insecticides,
Pesticides, Paint Thinner, Electrical Outlets, Toys Smaller then a Fist
(choking hazard), Food with Bones in it, Window Blinds draw cords, Every
Automobile, Scissors, Glue with Fumes, Trees for them to fall out of,
etc...

Look, I've got a toddler and you just have no idea how *many* common
household items are really, *really* dangerous to a child.

That, or we could actually look at the numbers and realize that there
really *aren't* "quite a lot of children dying" due to firearms
accidents and the ones that do are really statistical aberrations (as
"callous" as it sounds).  Guns just *aren't* that big a threat to
children.  Really.

(BTW, the fences 'round pools wouldn't do much good.  IIRC, most
drownings are either residents or guests of residents.)
