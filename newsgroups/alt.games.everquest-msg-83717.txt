Ok, how about a non-English post saying something like: "Any French-speaking
peeps out there who could help me with a problem I have, please?"

Or, as I've seen before: "If you can't help, could you post my request for
help in English since I can`t write it well enough as to not sound insulting
and/or coherent?"

Or: "Any Portuguese playing on Nameless nowadays?"

Or: "Hey, Eiji, are you still hanging around this ng? Remember that FBSS I
lent you? Well, I kinda need it back..."

Or: "Everything in the game box is in English. I can only read Croatian and
Hungarian. Everyone tells me to 'RTFM' but I can`t. Could anyone help?"

Or: "Calling all Swedes! I've just put up a weapons and armour data base in
Swedish so, if English isn't your forte, feel free to drop by
http://www.realmofsven.com"

Or: "Hey, we're starting a German-based guild on Karana. Come join!"

But, I've never read one saying: "I sure hope that that Brownlee fellow and
all those English-speaking people feel personnally insulted and threatened
by my posting in my native tongue."

Nope, never seen anything like that.

OgreLowbie (whose mother tongue isn't English - not by a long shot)
