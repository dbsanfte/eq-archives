I am unaware of any DAoC patch (except mini releases) that don't 
have something for every level and class.

DAoC implemented that also--the Battlegrounds. PvP area where 
the most you had to worry about was someone 4 level higher 
than you.

Agreed, as you would have had much more diversity in what 
path you took your toon, or second toon, on.

Of course, until SWG, nothing is going to touch the three realms of DAoC.

THAT would have been worth $30.00. 

My God, EQ is second to, and this makes me ill, the SIMS! That 
game doesn't implement a thing that everyone can't enjoy. Me, I face the fact
that if I pay $30.00 now, when I hit level 45-50, I will have new areas and
spells.

Hey Sony: Hint--When I hit level 45-50 I already will have new spells and
areas--the ones I have not played yet. Therefore, if I make it to level 45, and
I get bored with what is there, if I am still playing, maybe I'll spend $30.00.

Seems to me a few items, spells and areas for my level would have been good
marketing.
