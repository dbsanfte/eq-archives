Usually one has time to gate away, like the time I was at Treants in SK.  My
cleric and 3 SKs were chopping the trees when the SKs decide to pull despite my
warning them that I was at 30% mana and them at 40-50% HP.  They died and I
gated away.



-Well, God was my co-pilot....but we crashed into a mountain and I had to eat
Him.
