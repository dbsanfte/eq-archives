All the friends and guildies aside, I play a druid as my main so I don't
think I'd be that bad off.  I really don't worry about armor for the sake of
AC since I usually don't get hit - or even bumped quad kiting/rootnrot'n.
The stuff I wear is ALL +WIS so I'd imagine I'd seek out some of the more
'coin-oriented' spawns I've seen through the levels and just use wis/mana I
had out of the box on them until I could start boosting the armor/wis a bit
more.

Long ago, after reading someone's excellent post here about the SoM quest, I
decided to try it, so I certainly could earn some decent coin in short order
towards some less expensive wis pieces running the quest and generating more
steins.  The VESM I carry now - from Yaka Razorhoof in GD,  is becoming
pretty common and besides, Yaka has been soloable for some time now so I
could have my current weapon back in minutes.  Only pisser right now would
be having to go back to HH and start checking Dyllin again every so often -
NOT a big deal though.

All in all, it actually sounds kinda fun.  I suppose at 51 it would seem
even funner since I have no shortage of challenges at the present.

Great topic for discussion though, thanks for firing the opening shot
(hopefully).
