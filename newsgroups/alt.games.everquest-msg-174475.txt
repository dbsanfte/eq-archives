Was lagging kinda bad the other day (was on trip and had to use dial-up on
laptop).

Well, I was headed to a vendor to sell the bronze and fine steel that the
dwarves were dropping, and due to the wonderful lag click...I acidentally
sold my Bone Handled Schimitar to the vendor...for a whopping 4pp 2gp )c:

Didn't even know it until I was looking for something and noticed my primary
slot empty.  I was like WTF, and scrolled up to see "You received 4pp, 2gp
for Bone Handled Schimitar".  I just sat there dumbfounded, oh well, time to
quaff a few Dwarven Ales and cry in my beer.  (c;

I'm a little more careful now, to say the least...
