I know all about this problem, I dont have to tell you they don't
bathe, they are lazy and they breed like crazy. I do blame the direct
prime contractor for them being here taking our resources, speaking
thier language, and making our city uglier evdery day!

I am so glad they keep the trolls in the outer city of Neriak, too bad
they don't eat more rats!
