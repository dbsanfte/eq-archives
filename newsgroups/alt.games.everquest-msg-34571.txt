Ummm...the whole point of my post was that no-one should expect anyone else
to save their butt. Therefore, you do whatever it takes to survive. If that
means running a train to the zone, do it. If you can give warning, do it! If
someone tells you to stay and die they better damn well be a lvl 56 Cleric
who is going to give you a free Rez.

Zones are not safe. Never have been, never will be.
