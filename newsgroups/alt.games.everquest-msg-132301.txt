I strongly question your numbers, based on the fact that they total to 100%.
There are still other ways AIDS is acquired which are not listed here.  I
find it very very hard to believe that there are no individuals in the world
who have acquired AIDS as infants from their mothers (which I know to still
be true).  I would also not be surprised to find that there are at least a
small number on individuals alive who have acquired AIDS via contaminated
blood transfusions -- yes I know that in the US this has not been done for
some time, but there is a chance that those individuals are still alive.
Also, nothing in medicine is ever 100% -- there is always a small percentage
of "unknown".
