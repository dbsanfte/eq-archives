Never said it was pathological or nuthouse material, Dave,
just said that some people seem to have the need. But please
feel more than free to read into anything you think applies
into my statements.

Ok... I'm having fun.  I'm just think it's funny that you
equate "having a need for recognition strong enough to /ooc
DING to a zone full of people = pathological, nuthouse
material".  I maintain that a person wouldn't be doing it if
it didn't fulfill some need, yes, a psychological one.  I
pet my cat everyday, because doing so fills a need in me,
yes, a psychological one.
