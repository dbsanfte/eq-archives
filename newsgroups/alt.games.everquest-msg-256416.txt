Hey folks,

I saw a post made several days back about a caster wanting on his melee
skills.  It was suggested that he visit the level 1 bank in Katta, as it's
permarooted and never attacks.  I've got a 54 Erudite necro, so going to
Katta is a bit out of the question because the banker's level 1 (so no
skill-ups), and the bank is surrounded by DB KOS guards.  (They hurt, and
have no hesitation of swatting me stupid.)

I've heard that dueling someone can help raise weapon skills.  I've got
access to a level 54 druid on a separate account, and can bot her.  Anyone
know if dueling helps weapon skills?  If not, does anyone know of fairly
easy wasy to raise melee/offense skills?  It's not a pressing issue for me,
as I can just go to the boats of Dulak, snare and scare (fear kite), and do
it that way too.

Thanks.
