After you accumulate enough +int items, you will be able to start swapping
out +int stuff for +cha stuff.  But if you're just starting, you can't go
wrong with the dual-stein approach.

I try to maximize both.  With my current setup, with buffs, I have a 200 int
and a 190 cha.  For trade skills, I swap in +int stuff to get to 234 int and
142 cha.

The jury is still out on the effect of cha on mez.  Some see a small
increase, some don't.

But it does matter for charming.  Get your cha as high as possible.  There
seems to be a break around 180 or so.

Gnomes rule.  Pasketti is a level 51 gnome enchanter.  Agnostic gnomes start
out non-KOS to Dark Elves.  And being small has many advantages - you can
fit through holes in walls and between bars in grates and stuff.

BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  I'm sorry.  I couldn't hold that in.  Tinkering is cool
and gnomish and worth taking up for that reason alone.  But you will never
make up the money you sink into it.  I'm 135 at tinkering, and it's going to
stay there until some more items get added.

They are very worthwhile.  I still wear my mask and gloves, and wield that
rod.  And of course, there's the Stein of Moggok quest, perhaps the best
low-level cash cow quest in the game.  Do this enough, and you won't be KOS
in Oggok either.

But the best thing about being an enchanter is that you can do almost any
quest in the game.  The NPC won't talk to you?  Zap him with
Alliance/Benevolence/Collaboration.  Chances are he will after that.
