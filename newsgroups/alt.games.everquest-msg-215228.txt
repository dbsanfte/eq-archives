This is the gear I have,
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=758919 , also got
clarity and other mind buffs on to keep med time down.

I am on my way to lvl 38 getting steady exp at Spectres in Feerot.
Spectres were white/yellow/blue at 36 but are now mostly blue, some
white. This camp have been good for me, can do irl stuff when medding,
but I will go back to grouping when I get ch spell at 39 ;-)
