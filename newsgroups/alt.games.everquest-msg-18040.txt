1HB. You will not be meleeing much past about 24 (although its hard to
wean a druid off carrying a weapon for many levels after that). You will
probably eventually want to carry 2 stat enhancing items (a paw and a
testament or whatever). Even if you only have 1 item, you obviously can
only hold it if you don't use 2HB, so you have a choice between 1HB and
1HS. There are far more 1HB items you can use than there are 1HS, since
you're restricted to scimitars. Yes, you could pick 1HS so you can use
your epic when you get that far, but any druid actually meleeing with
his epic is probably bad news :)

Practice them all if you must, but personally I would concentrate on
1HB.

For info on playing a druid, theres:

http://www.eqdruids.com
http://eq.castersrealm.com/menu/druid.asp

Castersrealm is good since it has lots of player-written hunting and
strategy guides organised by level. Most are trash written by d00ds, but
there's the occasional gem in there.

The beauty of a druid is that you have so many different types of spells
that you can fill in pretty much any role. You aren't as good a nuker as
a wizard but you're better than nothing, you aren't as good a healer as
a cleric but you're better than nothing, you aren't as good a buffer as
a shaman but you're better than nothing, you aren't as good a dotter as
a necro but you're better than nothing, etc, etc.

You're a jack of all trades.

You're actually an OK tank into your teens, too - just don't expect to
melee much after that, when everyone else is getting big, hard armour,
dual wield, double attack, etc, and you are left ineffectually trying to
hit something with occasional swings of your mace while something is
cutting you a new one through your easy-tear leather armour.

In the above example, where theres a cleric and a wizard, you would be
probably be a secondary healer, keeping the cleric healed when he's
getting beaten on, and damageshielding the tanks (when you get your
shield of thorns type spells), and you should be snaring everthing to
avoid runners. In an outdoor group you also provide SoW (well, when you
get to 14) and you can harmony camps to manage a large spawn. You can
also root stuff that is beating on the wizard so he can back away if
noone can taunt the mob off him.
