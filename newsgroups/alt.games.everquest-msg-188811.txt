Totally agree on the weapon suggestions and the Velium HP stuff, but the
Coterie armor, though a few pieces look nice would absolutely destroy
whatever little Fire Resist I don't have as a Troll.  Imagine it could even
put me in the negative if that is even possible.  Also most of that armor
raises INT which is rather worthless to me as a Beastlord.

Thanks for the suggestions so far though.
