I havent' done it yet, but there's supposed to be a quest NPC that you
turn in old planar armor to for XP and possible cash gem rewards. I know
folks have turned in Fear and Hate armor. But I'm wondering... does PoG
armor work? We were in there last night on the "Quest For Fast Cash" and
got some drops. We had people who needed them, but it's only a small
group farming and we could easily see drops that we don't have a class
for there. Are they worth scooping up for this quest? Anybody tried it?
