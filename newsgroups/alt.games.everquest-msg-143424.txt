Well the Wyverns are not giving me much XP anymore and everyone tells me to
wait until 57 for the Othmirs so I guess it is Raptor Island for me.  I went
there and did a couple of quads and the xp is good (loot is for the birds)
but the agro range on these guys is ridiculous!

Any suggestions on how to kite and avoid adds would be greatly appreciated.
Also, where to med?  I used my mana-free Lessor Succor, sat on Chessboard
Island medding and fishing and then SoE on back to the Raptor Island - is
there a better way?
