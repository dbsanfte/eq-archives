Thanks all, for replies, most of it I could figure for myself as it's just
common sense. Just 1 part I needed reminding on, although I didn't really
want to hear that about my Lance :ï¿½(...I am fully aware of what DoT's do
when it comes to Mes (I bot an Enchanter and Druid, so I have first hand
experience) I just hadn't thought of it with this weapon as it hadn't
occurred to me that Adds would sometimes become main targets. Why it hadn't
I don't know, I often switch and mes original pull/target when botting
<sigh> So thankyou both John's.
I also figured the proc not to be High Aggro when compared to that of a DD,
I guess I am now hoping it is, as Davian says, because if not it's not much
use to me.

Davian's warning has made a small dilemma ...If the lance generates aggro
with procs that could get me squished, what is my Fleshgrinder or Blood
Points going to do? In this situation, should I avoid proc'ing weapons
totally?

Paid 9k for Lance on Sunday and it's now 7k...always the way
