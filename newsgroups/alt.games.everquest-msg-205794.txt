Bah!  How lame!  Equipping gear looted from mobs, how pathetic.
What game do you think you're playing anyway?  Besides, it's not
as if the gear was actually useful, it didn't do the mobs any
good, did it?  :-p

[By the time I discovered mobs that dropped bows and arrows I
had much better gear that was self-made.  And with later chars
I always felt that getting a bow was vital for pulling, that
way if you got six instead of one you had a headstart running
for the zone.  Bow first, weapon second, then armor, armor,
more armor, and did I mention armor? was my approach to melees.]
