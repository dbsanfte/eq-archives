http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi
For 1150 pts you can get a 2dmg for fast weapons or a 4dmg aug for slower
weapons.  Theres also several other combinations of (dmg + elemental dmg).
Unfortunately, these are all type 6 so you gotta have either ldon (or some
of the newer player made weapons) to put them in.  There may be exceptions
to that rule dropping in GoD, but I dont know much about those.
