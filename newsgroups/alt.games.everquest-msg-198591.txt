   I think I saw your response, Dan.  I hope that mine showed up as
well.  Well, there is a slight change in what I wrote.  It seems that
I am now the Guild Leader, though I was not expecting or campaigning
for the position.

   Anyways, if you still cannot see the response I put up explaining
it, I will repost.  And no, the AGE guild does not mind /testbuff
newbs.  If you are on the test server, and in the AGE chat channel
(/join serverwide.age:age), I will issue an invite.   I don't have any
experience being a GL, and I am sure there are others  who would be
better at it than me, but I will do the best job that I am able.

    However, I am having major problems getting into the game right
now.  Everytime I get to character selection screen, I crash.  I have
made it a few times by deleting my ini files, but that only works
sometimes.  The last time I made it in, I hade to go to production
side, log in, log off, then come back to testside.  I'm hoping I
figure out a way to deal with this.

Annie
