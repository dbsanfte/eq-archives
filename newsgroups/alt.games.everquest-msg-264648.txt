   I know it sure felt odd when I quit.  I mean, it still doesn't feel real
to me that I'm not playing any more.  I'm really enjoying CoH, but I am
hoping that EQII has the same draw for me just so that I can be be back in
Norrath, and enjoying it again.

   I'm just glad I haven't been hit with a ton of "You don't play EQ, so
stop hanging around here!" posts.

   So you might take your haitus as early as Thanksgiving, eh?  Just seems
like you just came back from your last one!
