The below-mentioned link is a backdoor Trojan program.  It will *not* give
you more plat.  It will allow outside access to your system and,
potentially, really screw you up.

Of course, this scheme was a failure from step 1, as no reasonably
intelligent person would fall for this.  Truly, this was a very poor attempt
at spreading a Trojan.  The guy that started the Melissa virus did a much
better job; he posted a Word document in alt.sex where he claimed to have
listed passwords that could be used to access various porn sites.  That
proved irresistible to quite a few folks in that newsgroup.  =)
