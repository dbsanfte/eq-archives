Now if they had an email trade system I wouldn't even have to log in to B&S.
Seems convenient, but I thought the shopping trips to town were something to
look forward to. It's nice to see other people in towns and not just
automatons. Frantic Freeport will become as populated as the outback of
Stonebrunt. IMHO that will be the end of a fun aspect of the game. I would
have much preferred a consignment/vendor system.
