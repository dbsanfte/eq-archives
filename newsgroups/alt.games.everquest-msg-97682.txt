I agree with that perspective, actually. I have no interest in a
"race to 60," indeed I
doubt I'll ever see 60 no matter how long I play. And that
doesn't dissuade me from
playing EQ. Exploring the vast rich gameworld, meeting new
groups, figuring out new techniques or challenges -- that's the
fun of it.

So what made hell levels hellish was not the slower exp per se.
Rather, those levels really accentuated the game's existing
grind in terms of the time spent sitting and medding, etc.
Plus the difficulty finding groups in new and interesting areas
such as dungeons.
Hell level 30 really drove the point that the game had largely
devolved into
a very repetitive, endless, grind of medding and casting in OT.
Over and over and over and over....really made me realize how
tedious
the game had become by that point.

If those issues were addressed, then I wouldn't mind hell levels
particularly. Sounds like
a lot of folks around here agree. So it may be that Verant has
kind of missed the forest for the trees on the hell levels topic.
