Interestingly enough, and I, even and especially at the time, considered it
a poor reflection on my guild, both of the healers that were used in the
Ikkinz 1-group trials to allow us to access the raids were...  2-boxed.  One
was my pocket cleric, another was a raid cleric that was in the process of
moving so had let others have access to her account to use as needed for
just such purposes.

Time /played means *everything* when it comes to equipment.  Time /bazaar'ed
doesn't count, though I'm sure there must be some level 1 out there with
more /played time than me.  =)

Efficiency is achievable by anyone.  Referencing a side-discussion in this
thread, that is one of the reasons people will invite certain guild tags to
groups.  Competency, and the efficiency that comes with competency, is
expected.
