I'm afraid I can't generate any sympathy for people who made that
particular mistake. They made their purchases based on pre-release
information, which Verant has taken great pains to state is subject to
change, time and again.

Beside which, the people who did make that mistake aren't exactly out
of luck - they have the option of selling the tunic to someone else.
