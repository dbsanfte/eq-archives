I don't lecture, I just ignore, they'll get the hint eventually.

I ignore folks with racy names too.  If I think thier name is explicit, 
I'll put them on ignore before I even see one thing they say. Only 
petitioned a name once, some mental giant in Sharvahl with the name 
Usama on Sept 15, 2001.  Was still very upset from Sept 11th's tragedies 
then, only came online to escape the horrors for few hours. Everyone in 
the area was giving him a hard time, he was shouting back stupidity. 
His name got changed midsentence, boy was he pissed.  Didn't have my log 
on then by default, sure wish I did now.
