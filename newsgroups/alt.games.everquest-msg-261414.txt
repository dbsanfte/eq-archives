Yes, they are fucking morons...

(My gigabit switch was just returned to sender Friday, reason: failed 
delivery 4 times, and not picked up in 5 days after that)
Failed delivery 1, reason: Package missed, no attempt to delivery made
Failed delivery 2, reason: Package missed, no attempt to delivery made
Failed delivery 3, reason: Package missed, no attempt to delivery made
Failed delivery 4, reason: Package missed, no attempt to delivery made
And I received no notification (they never even stopped by to stick a 
yellow sticker on the door, or called... I have an answering machine and 
caller id, and they had my phone number) that I had to pick the damn 
thing up.
After spending 3 hours on the phone with the company I bought it from I 
finally found some manager with his head not too far up his ass to 
reship to me, waiving the $25 restocking fee. He's even going to have 
them eat the cost difference of changing it to Fed Ex, even though I was 
quite willing to pay for that. First 4 guys I talked to would not even 
look at ups's tracking site to see that the failed deliveries are not my 
fault. They hung up on me once when I got... colorful. I don't suppose I 
blame them, really.

Tyas, the still Gigabitless.
