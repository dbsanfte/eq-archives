English is my native tongue and I do make mistakes.  The mistakes are not
the issue.  Even in German, I assume that punctuation is used, capital
letters are used.  It makes a huge difference on the readability of a post.
I am not saying conform or else, just offering some advice here.  I very
rarely make fun of someone because their posts have mistakes in them,
particularly when it is due to English not being their native tongue.  Well,
unless it's a particularly amusing mistake anyway.  As far as using
abbreviations like the ones you do, I don't use them in game, or out.  You
are certainly welcome to post however you choose, however, the more readable
your posts are, the more likely people are to read them.
