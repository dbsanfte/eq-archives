No, I'm not talking about new characters, just starting out.  Between
my level 52 druid and my 44 ranger, I don't even have 2k in the bank.
And there are a lot of characters in the same boat.

I could have cited succor, but we're talking about Levitate and how
useful it is and how nice it is to not have to go dump a lot of plat
on a charged item.

Yeah, I'd hope they'd res you too.  But we were discussing the utility
of druids vs. the utility of monks.  Not the utility of a character
AND they're guild.

And it takes a druid less than a minute to get there, and that's only
if you count med time for Ring of Cobalt Scar.

FD is awesome.  FD is huge.  No argument there.

Yeah, but with snare, that opens up ALL the dungeons, not selected
ones.

*sigh*  The point I was responding to was hughes claiming that druids
and enchanters soloed as well as a druid and that they had no
"downside" as a class.  I WAS NOT claiming that druids were better
than monks, they just have a lot of really useful spells that make the
game easier for them.  Druids have obvious marks against them too
though.  They don't do anything as well as another class (except maybe
traveling), and in the high end game they are not a 'required' class.
It doesn't make druids useless, just like the lack of ability to cast
some spells doesn't make monks useless, but there are things about
playing a monk that you have to work around.  Whether you see these as
all that big a deal or not, and I'm glad you don't, is irrelevant.
