I did indeed read the rest of your post and enjoyed it, and admired
your audaciousness.  I would have been quite nervous circling around
FM at level 16.

All the more puzzling then your balking at the minor obstacle of BBM.

I agree that the druid should have told you where he meant to take you
and I agree that you didn't get precisely what you paid for.  But....

Virtually everyone in the EQ world will accept BBM as a substitute for
GFay and think absolutely nothing of it.  It isn't exactly a dangerous
zone.  And as you get to be higher level, there will be more and more
times where a fair amount of running is required after you get your
port.

With absolutely no intent to flame you, I suggest that you start
learning your way around BBM.  Like it or not, there are many more
dr00dz than wizzies in this marvelous EQ world of ours.
