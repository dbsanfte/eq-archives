The master looter must be aware that he should never loot no drop
items.  A FFA looter might manage to convince you he didn't know
any better (as though setting yourself to loot no-drop only on warning
was difficult) but a Master Looter?  Never.

There's a problem with ML, but its not the no drop stuff.  Problem
I generally see is that half the time, the group splits up and the ML
person keeps all the "trash" loot, which at my level can actually
add up to a few hundred pp worth of vendor sellables.  Is this a huge
deal?  No, not really.  But it does seem to reduce the trust I hold
in those looters.
