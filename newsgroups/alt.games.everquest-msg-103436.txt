This is the basis on which I work. The MT, at least a good one, has a pretty
good grasp of how much damage he can and is taking. If he yells "Run" or
"Zone" then I am out of there. Of course the clerics "oom" is frequently the
trigger for this event.

I have great admiration for those tanks who stand and hold the enemy till
they drop. Although I know that in most cases, by the time things have gone
bad, the tank (who has lots of agro and no hit points) doesn't really have
a realistic chance of getting far.
