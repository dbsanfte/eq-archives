Not if he's a monk: monks have two choices, blind or expensive.  If there
were half elf monks, -then- you could deride him for making a silly pick.
But nightblind, if you are playing a class that has no remedy, is -so- crippling
as to be a slap in the face of anyone picking humans as the default "norm"
race they seem to be on the face of it.

The lack of infravision items in the world seems like an astonishing oversight,
but there you have it, humans, erudites, and barbarians are born blind and
stay that way, a "greater light stone" is a joke, and the only remedies are
spells or a mage summoned stone, by and large.
