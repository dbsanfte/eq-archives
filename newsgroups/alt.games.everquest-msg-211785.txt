Psst, bards gots track, the ability to move fast, invis, and solo things.  I only mention due to your saying "other than ranger
or druid", although bard track is even shorter range than druid track its still adequate for some of the things you mention
above.  That said, ranger track covers twice the range of bard track (and so what, 4 times the area?) and works worlds better
due to track sorting.
