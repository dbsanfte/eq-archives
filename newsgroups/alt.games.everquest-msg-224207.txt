Considering that I've bought all of the expansions as they've come out 
at $30+ each, that's one hell of a sweet deal. (well, ok, I haven't 
gotten LDON yet)

Perhaps if you'd bought it non-secondhand in the first place, you could 
afford it properly, eh?

And because of my interest in EQ, I haven't bought the latest Sims 
expansions, Never Winter Nights, Sim City 4, and a bunch of other games. 
No time to play them when I can play EQ. So there's hundreds of dollars 
I've saved.
