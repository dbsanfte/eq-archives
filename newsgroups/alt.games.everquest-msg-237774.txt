Some folk like to play that way...

When I first started I picked a wood elf rogue..
during the second month of EQ believe me it was the hardest combo going.

It was great. Made lots of friends long gone but not forgotten.
No idea if Hyarth(sp) dorf rogue aack I have forgot the name of the WE rogue
that gave me my Dark elf hide gloves  and the Barb rogue ( when Barb rogues
were the shunned of the rogues) tha got everyone drunk in NF on Bleeding
Brains.. Sob.. must look up old files..
I think the "safehouse" was the forerunner of eq web support..

I digress.

camaraderie challenge satisfaction of playing the unplayable makes a game
fun for some.

the last several years I have played several toons on a few servers in a
casual way but never will regain the old spark.

That's why to play the hardest..

now a days I don't really think anything is hardest unless it goes against
your style.

Have to be in the action play a cleric.
Like to be watch your team mates and support the team play a necro or druid.
Hate twitch toons play a ... hmmm any caster class that likes to swap spells
necro shammy maybe or rogue
but even macros changed this...

Actually playing any class well is hard..

I guess what do define Hard to play by ?
