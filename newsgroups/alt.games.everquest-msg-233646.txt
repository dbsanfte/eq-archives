We got some help 1 time, as a "1 off don't ask again" deal... it didn't help
all affected people, and the gm logged before completion and wouldn't come
back =p

We don't use pets for part of our VZ strat.. Also crit nukes don't have any
more agro attached than the regular damage of the nuke is something I hear
very often in guildchat.

VZ is difficult for much more than that though... for example if the MA
dies, the next tanks usually have a real issue in keeping agro.  Losing tank
1 on TZ just means 1-2 deaths, losing tank 1 on VZ can mean half the raid
instagibbed
