She just wacked me good - corpse is in her hut.  Knew I shouldn't have
killed Scout Maitlin in Blackburrow, but he was KS'ing again and I got mad.
Now, Knights of Thunder are all KOS to me.

Question 1:  Will /corpse drag the corpse to me w/o getting this crazed
cleric on my butt again?

Question 2:  Anything I can do while nekkid that'll raise faction w/ Knights
of Thunder before my corpse rots?

Thanks in advance,
Gnardo, 30th Stupid Barb Warrior
