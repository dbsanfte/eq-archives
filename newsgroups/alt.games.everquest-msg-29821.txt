Now kill a second.  You each have a total of 51000 exp.
Kill a third.
Kill a fourth
Kill a fifth.

thats 127,500 exp.  Your solo character is now ready for his second
kill, while the partnership is ready to do 5 more.

Caveats: if mammoths are relatively hard to come by, then you'll
not see this boost.  If your partnership isn't well suited, (for
example in most cases two people the same class) then you
won't be killing at this rate, either, rather you will see merely
twice the kills.. for a relatively measly boost in exp.

On the other hand, with a -good- partnership, kill rates even higher
than 5 to one are quite possible.  Cleric and ranger, for example,
can do 10 times what either can solo in a given span of time.

Adding a third member won't give you as much of a pickup as that
partner would, and the fourth and up will each do even less for you.
The
vaunted group bonus makes up for this to some extent, but I'd say the
optimal group size for killing mobs you can solo, but which are
plentiful,
would be three.

Killing mobs you can solo, though, is not the only things a group can
do.  A group can take down stuff you can't -touch- solo.  A good
group of 20s can take that 25 mammoth and look for a second
for breakfast, and that 10,000 exp each looks a lot sweeter to
a level 20 than 50,000 exp does to a level 25.  Not only does this
part of the exp calculation register this way, but if you aren't
twinked out, the loot off a level 25 mob is generally better than
that off a level 20.  (Not knowing a thing about mammoth hunting,
substitute in any two level numbers a good distance apart for
"25" and "20")

Also, you say that the group will need to heal and med...but
really, if they are taking down stuff you can solo, they won't
need to do so.  You'll have a dedicated healer, who can
get the tanks healed up while they finish off the mobs, then
med while the dedicated puller goes out and gets the next,
and during most of the combat.  Your nukers won't be
spending themselves blind, they'll drop a couple bombs
but no more than they can med back before the next mob
shows up.  Your tanks won't have to sit at all, since the healer
is at their backs.  Depending on the composition of your group,
you'll have buffs of your own (more AC, more HP, haste, stats
resists) and your targets will be debuffed (slower, lower stats,
lower resists...) so that each kill hurt you less and go faster.  If
your group and situation are right, you may literally take no
damage at all (root and shoot fest, kiting, reverse kiting, charm
kiting) and any pets will (unlike solo) not cost you any experience,
essentially free bonus tanks that heal up ten times as fast as
Player Characters.

Second caveat: Bad groups will just suck.  One thing about
solo, you always know who is at fault when you die.
