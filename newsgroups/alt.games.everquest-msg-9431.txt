There's another way to hit those mobs: pets.

Sometimes I wonder if the reason the Burynai Cutter is so rare is that
its placeholder is one of the Burynai that is stuck under the world.

Another zone where mobs can get under the world pretty easily is South
Ro.  If someone runs south to zone to get away from a Sand Giant, it
sometimes ends up under the world on the way back to the desert.

I don't know exactly where you were, but in many places on the FOB you
can do that, but you aren't in danger of actually falling out of the
zone.  You can see but can't go through.  There have always been a few
places like this, all around the world, but as of a month or so ago,
they became much more common.

Be careful camping near any such place.  I've noticed that if you camp
near a "peek through the world" spot that is not a "fall through the
world spot", there is a good chance that when you log back in, you will
be on the other side.  Nothing bad usually happens, other than you fall
a while, and then get a message that you are being moved to the zone
safe spot.  For some large zones, this might be a viable travel method.
