A sound arguement, except that there are only 4 races that get xp
penalties:

Barbarians (NIGHT BLIND)
Trolls
Ogres
Iksars

All other races are baseline, with the exception of halflings who get both
infravision and an xp BONUS...halflings out-level every other race. Of
those "all other" races, all but 2 have some form of night vision...dark
elves of course have the best in the game. No xp penalty for them.
