This is really valid.  I'm thinking of Final Fantasy XI.  In FFXI,
first damage/spell/ability that touched a mob claimed it.  Once it was
claimed no one else could touch it unless the claimant "called for
help."  And if you called for help, the kill was worth no exp/loot.
This definitely affected the feel of the game.  It meant no outside
help.  You couldn't help stop a train, you couldn't help someone get
those last few hps off the mob before it killed them.

The major thing I wasn't crazy about is that rare spawn monsters were a
just a spamfest.  You and 5 other people would just stand in an empty
room mashing the crap out of your Provoke macros until the mob popped,
instead of the EQ courteous-camp style (and maybe this is just a
different ethic in a different game, or Japanese playstyle, or
whatever, but I felt it was mostly caused by the tag system).  So
basically, whoever had the least latency won.  This applied to pretty
much all rare monsters, from ultra-rare mobs with valuable drops,
semi-rare mobs, and even the huge weekly epic targets.

I like the WoW system.  The tag pretty much just applies to loot/exp.
You can still help people, you can still get aggro from their mob.  The
closest thing to a KS is the fact that if someone higher than you
attacks it you get greatly reduced exp.  (I was once griefed by a
player on the opposing faction by him just running around one-shotting
all my mobs so I got 12 exp a kill).
