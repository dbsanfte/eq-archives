I think I read somewhere that AC, like ATK, is a combination of
two or more things reflected in a single number.  That's fine;
mostly it's enough to know that "bigger numbers are better".
Still, I do like to have some idea of what affects it, so I can
judge whether to quest for (or buy) a possible upgrade.  So I
keep a record of my characters' gear and stats.

In the case of my Monk, it was a little tricky recording his AC,
since I'm currently running around about 5-7 stones overweight,
which drives down his AC.  I wanted to see what his AC would be
without all the weight, but with all his current gear.  To make
a long story short, I ended up having to shed some AC gear to get
my weight down far enough.  The strange part is, I then put back
on an item (Shackle of Stone) that claims to be just AC +4, no
other stats, and it raised my AC by 7.

Does anyone have a theory about AC that would account for that?
