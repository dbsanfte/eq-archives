This happened to me as well.....in my case, it was not a software
issue....it's a heat issue...EQ just makes the processor, video, Hard
drive, and CPU run HARD. If your case cooling can't keep up with it,
you crash to desktop when it gets too hot. I ended up opening the case
on both of my computers (I run two accounts) and placed a desk fan
blowing directly into the system. Haven't crashed to desktop since in
months. 

Athlon processors kick butt in games, but they run hot. Make sure they
stay cool.
