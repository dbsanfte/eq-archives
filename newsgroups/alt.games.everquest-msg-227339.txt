I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to learn that the "no gate" 
horror of Veeshan's Peak had been removed some time this year. I'd had a 
key for a while, but had never been in there.

I got invited to go there with a group of friends this weekend and 
jumped at the chance. The zone is beautiful! For an old world zone, the 
developers really put some care into making a nice place.

So we go in and begin clearing out yard trash and moving towards some 
named. We took out Silverwing, which I thought was pretty good for 
twelve of us. We also tried Hoshkar. That ... ummm....didn't go so well. 
There was one other enchanter type named that we attempted also. The 
pull went well, but before I could even hit the assist key, the MA was 
apparently charmed. Oddly, that troll killed me faster than any dragon 
ever had.

*sigh*

Welcome back, Kotter. You are now naked at your bind point.
