Hehe you're changing the subject.  Overall I'm totally 100% pleased with
being an enchanter.  It's even easier for an enchanter to get a group from
level 16-38 than it is for a cleric. From 39-59 for xp groups it's about
even.  From 50-60 in raid groups it's clerics and warriors who have the
easiest time, though I've almost never known either class to turn down C2
(mana) or AQ (speed) if offered by a departing enchanter. :p
