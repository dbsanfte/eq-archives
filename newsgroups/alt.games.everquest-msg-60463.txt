Quick question

I haven't managed to get a hold of my tooth to CS yet, due to the fact that
my guilds scheduled trips to collect them are done when I am asleep, due to
me being a British player.

Rather than set-up a run to CS with some of my guild just for me, what are
my chances of getting through on my own?  I haven't spoken to my guild about
this, as I know they would offer to help, I am just kinda sounding out the
idea.

I have no idea how dangerous a run this is, as I have never entered Kael,
and know very little about this zone.  Can I invis, wolf form (for the extra
speed) and leg it through to WL, if so what are my chances of managing
this?... if any LOL

Cheers!
