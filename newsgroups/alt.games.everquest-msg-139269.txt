But that doesn't make him an idiot.  He can lower his price
tomorrow to 6K, then to 5K, then to 4K... keep doing
it till he finds the price point.  Or he can just keep it there
hoping someone with more cash than sense comes along,
heck, maybe its his current best weapon!  Since he's not
fighting while a trader, he puts it on the block at an outrageous
price, if it sells, he buys something better. If it doesn't,
when he's ready to go hunt, he puts it back in his weapon
slot and is good to go.

I used to get offers on my Drakkal Icegrinder (ages ago
when Velious was relatively new, and it seemed an Uber
weapon to most people I grouped with) and I'd offer
to sell for 9kpp.  This was A) simpler than saying no,
B) virtually assured me I'd keep it, and C) meant that
if someone was crazy enough to buy, I'd feel elated
at how rich I'd become.

With the advent of the bazaar, this seems like an ingenious
strategy, if you don't have 30 items in your bags, strip
off your best droppable gear and throw it in at inflated
prices.  If you don't get buyers, no big deal.  If something
happens to sell, you should be able to bargain hunt up
something acceptable as a temporary replacement, look
for a real replacement or upgrade, and still expect to have
lots of cash left over for your trouble.
