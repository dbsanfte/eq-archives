No, Scotty my lad, because truly there is nothing you have yet said that is
sufficiently deep or complex for that. ;-)

No, whaddyamean "never mind". I mind, because it really pisses me off to
have some wet-behind-the-ears kid with not even a micron's worth of the
background I have in studies of logic getting up on his hindlegs and trying
to lecture me on the subject.  When I start talking about a bogus copping to
authority, I am not, as your clownishly arrogant conceit would have it,
backing into the understanding of such things by accident. Before you were
even so much as born, no doubt, I was discussing these things with my fellow
students and professors at University.

So, dig it: before you presume of yourself that you are worthy of engaging
in discussions with me, first and finally get it straight in your head as to
just who you are talking to, namely a widely read, finely cultured,
well-educated man--you better know that.

But since you don't, indeed since you can't even so much as see that, so
that you should be so bereft of a mind of your own, that your perception
should be so clouded by prejudice that it has been so thoroughly snowed by
the ignorant, groundless, blind perceptions and outright falsehoods of my
detractors, that you should be that damn gullible and deluded, so that all
you can see in a guy like me is the ludicrous caricature these ill-cultured
boobs would draw of the actual person here--well?  That only speaks in
volumes about you, as to your gullibility, conformity, lack of guts, or
indeed the intelligence to recognize just the quality of mind to which you
address yourself.

No, you bastards, do you think I'm going to join your little game of selling
me short, here? Uh, I don't think so.  No.  I'll tell you just exactly who
you are talking to, when you are talking to me, sitting here, after all
these years of study and education--you bet your sweet asses, since you
can't recognize it for yourselves--or won;t:   I'll make damned sure that
who and what I am is not robbed from me by those who are too ignorant to see
the actual guy sitting here.  No, I won't be ripped off by those who
neurotically, childishly, cluelessly are so absurd as to rob another person
like that for motives that are too puny to mention.  And if you think even
for a minute that people don't do things like that, for motives too
infantile, too narcissistic to mention, and if you don't downright know
about those kind of motivations in people then you are really way too blind
and clueless, naive and lost in space to talk to.  Sylvia Plath is dead on
account of crap like that, and her snide little biographers full of their
"look at me, too" snot are still up to it--or you haven't read the one by
Anne Stevenson.

The feminists have it wrong:  it's nothing Ted Hughes did that killed Sylvia
Plath, it was the "friends" of Sylvia Plath, all those mutual 'pals' who
didn't have her talent, her husband, her abilities in the kitchen, her
immaculate housekeeping habits, her drive for success, her very success
itself--and people are like that when they don't have the beautiful humility
to appreciate the greatness that may be in their face, in their space. Some
people like Sylvia just don't have the defensive equipment to slough it off,
or give it a good punch in the nose when it comes prowling--it all went into
her art, her feelings about it.

Listen to me, Buddy. I could be just like Sylvia, but I've been through a
few things in life to show me how that way goes Death. Before I'd stick my
head in the oven over it, I'd shove yours in to the oven of what's what.
You hear that?

Getting hot and/or smelly enough in there for you?

Okay. In other words, don't ever presume to lecture me on subjects I've
known about more years than you've been alive; don't presume to address me a
t all until you have the guts to do it with the respect any human being
deserves.  Now, that's in spades, buddy. Don't forget it.  Have the guts to
be a guy, Guy.

No, I understand you perfectly, I understand that it is you in whom the
understanding must begin to take place, as you learn that deeper thinking is
called for, thought of a kind that has been entirely lacking among those of
your ethos and culture, a form of thought that I'm trying to bring back into
vogue.

That's what I mean.  You want everything spelled out in grammar school
simplicity for you, but that isn't what you're going to get from me.  You
are expected to subject all these things to thought and analysis because I'm
not just here to tell you things in plain to understand four-letter words,
rather I am trying to inspire you to think about things on the deeper, more
subtle and meaningful level from which these thoughts are deriving.  They
cannot be simplified.  I have no patience for the kind of superficiality and
superciliousness that will not relax enough to entertain that sort of
thought, there is more to the spiritual and psychic life of man than you may
well have imagined.

I expect people to think, and if they are still in the dark about something
I say, it's up to you to state what you think I am saying--but that would
take some guts.

You speak in these general terms without reference to any specific issue
which just tells me you're too lazy to concentrate, to entertain the
possibilities in what is being said.  What's the matter--you afraid that you
might actually get it? Yeah, and then you'd have to be a free-thinker too,
and then develop the kind of guts it takes to remain as such.

In these posts, you are going to find ill constructed sentences here and
there that slip by on a quick read-through but you are expected to be able
to get around things like that.  If you can't then that's pretty damn lame.
I'm not writing for money here, so if it's perfection you want, buy a goddam
book.

That's no kind of logical argument to counter what is said.  You're lazy.
And the 'rubbisn', in a word, is all yours.  Deal with the points or shut
up, fer the crissake.
