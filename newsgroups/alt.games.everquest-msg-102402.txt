You have a severe miscomprehension of who is holding the stick in the "plz"
relationship.

If I want them to /ooc that they like having sex with their younger brother
before I give them buffs, THAT IS MY REQUIREMENT. If they can't live up to
it, then they can live without my buffs.

I will never, EVER, buff anyone who asks for it with "plz". I don't care if
they (or you) don't like it. My mana, I'll do whatever the fuck I want with
it. Gaining the respect of someone who can't even be bothered to spell out
the word PLEASE is about as low on my priority list as it is possible to
be.
