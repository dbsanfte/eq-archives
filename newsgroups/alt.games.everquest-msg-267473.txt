That was your problem, really.   Contrary to what the crafting guides say, I
believe you're better off if you vote yourself off the island and raising
crafting normally.

It is not a huge moneysink in EQ2.  Most combines are set up to be break even
or a small profit, if you do the whole thing yourself.    Like those tempers
that you were blowing your hard earned copper on, 12 cp per combine.

Once you're off the island, you can go to your tradeskill society, buy mineral
water for 6 cp, a candle for 6 cp, and combine the two with a single foraged
component to produce 4 tempers at once.    You were paying 4 times as much on
each combine where you used a temper, because you didn't leave the island.
(Not to mention, you make exp for doing the combine to create the tempers as
well as the combine you then use the temper in.)

The tempers themselves sell to a vendor for 4c each, so you paid 3c (assuming
pristine quality) to make them, and sold them for a small profit.     It's
nothing you'll get rich doing... but  it's not the EQ style "pay 50 pp for the
materials, combine praying for a skill up, sell to vendor for 12 pp".

Doing my own sub combines, I spent about a total of 3 silver on fuel and water
before I produced my first good item.  (6 slot 5% weight reducing backpack)
I chose to keep it, but I see people selling them to other players for 4 - 5
silver.  (With supplies left over for many future combines.  Probably another
full backpack worth)

If money is *really* an issue, you can skill up a ways doing tier 1 / 2
combines, then vendoring the proceeds for a small profit.    The alchemy
combine is not the only profitable one.   Packets of spice for instance, can
be made from 3 vendor components costing 6 cp each, and sell for 24 cp.   It
would be boring as hell to make nothing but them for 6 levels, but you could
do it and come out ahead moneywise, even after buying all your skilll books,
and never having killed a single critter for startup cash.
