Doesn't help me out much, because A) I don't really understand much of 
it, and B) it is discussing classes which have time+ gear and full 
defensive AAs and worse C) it doesn't include Berserkers anyway, not to 
mention D) it doesn't include bards either, so I can test the rumor that 
bards and clerics are on a different table than warriors and knights.

Further, the classes weren't at even close to the same AC, I'd think it 
would have been a simple enough matter to control AC by stripping off 
some gear and by using Faith instead of Virtue so you could add or not 
add Ward of Gallantry.

Then some classes had defensive augments and some didn't.

Ideally, this should be done at 100 AC intervals from 1K to 2K AC for 
each class, in each case using characters as close in gear/aa as feasible.

Then, taking a character without a given AA, getting him that AA, and 
trying it again at the same AC, deliberately changing nothing about the 
situation but that one AA.

The way this test was done is a lot like taking all the people in an 
elementary school, sorting them by race and height, and then making 
conclusions about the connection between race and height while ignoring 
age and diet.

Still, I'll give this a shot:

Progression
warrior
monk
Paladin
shadow knight
ranger
rogue
beast
cleric
shaman
druid

Plate melee plus monk, chain melee, beastlord, then priests again in 
order plate, chain, leather.

Odd man out is the monk, who is in the middle of the plate classes for 
some reason, despite a nerf that I'm told put him deep in the priest 
regions.

Of course the problem is that he takes damage like a warrior but has HP 
like a druid

Still, back to berserker.  I'm looking over the chart trying to see 
-why- the order is the way it is.  It looks to me as though it isn't 
about any one thing, its about all of them added together; or rather its 
about mitigation and avoidance multiplied together.

I don't know what the mitigation of a berserker is, but the avoidance 
should be relatively easy to find; looking at the chart this seems to be 
the result of block dodge parry riposte... and some other factor I don't 
get, which shows in the miss% column (which apparantly factors out the 
above).

Various classes seem to score in those areas just as you might expect by 
their skill caps in them, with NA where they don't have a skill.

OK, Berserkers have dodge, parry, and riposte, with caps of 175, 175, 
and 225; they lack block entirely.

Is the Miss thing based on Defense?  Berserker defense cap is 240

And from there I'm really lost.

Grage, 55 Berserk, Luclin
Warrior
Monk
