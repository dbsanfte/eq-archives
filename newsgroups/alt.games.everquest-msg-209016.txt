Excuse me DT, but WTF is it you think you're saying here?  Each of
your posts makes less sense in context than the previous.  Are you
just putting up random crap in hopes of sparking an argument?  First
you're going on about things as if all items were priced in the same
way, which anybody who's ever checked the buy sell prices of damned
near any drop-only item knows is bullshit (how could you have missed
that in all the time you've been playing anyway?).  Then you start
maundering on about there not being a "RANGE" (your caps) of prices,
an idea not mentioned by any other poster (but if you took the time
to actually check it out in game you would find that that range does
exist, there is a point beyond which bad CHA doesn't hurt anymore,
which varies in the usual way between particular vendors).  Now, in
a thread where the relationship between buy and sell prices has been
central to the entire discussion you post this crap.  WTH drugs are
you on?  I want to know so I can avoid them like the evil they seem
to be.
