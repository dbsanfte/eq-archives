That's the flaw in your plan.

Each and every letter ever sent would have to be a completely seperate
item. EQ has no provision for parameters on items.

What I mean is this. Each item has a fixed ID number. You can see them
on magelo. When you enchant a block of clay, it's not the same block of
clay, just enchanted. It's a brand new enchanted block of clay. Think of
it as a spell: Summon enchanted Block of Clay, which has a reagent cost
of: 1 Block of Clay.

If you dye a piece of armor, you get a completely different peice of
armor. A Fine Steel BP is as different (in coding) from a Blue File
Steel BP as a Breastplate of Speed.

Because of this, every single letter ever written would have to be a
unique, separately IDed item. Items are currently 5 digits I believe. If
only a quarter of the people in eq sent one letter to see if that
worked, there's 6 digits worth of new items to account for on day one.

Would require a complete base-code reworking of the game. ie: I don't
think it would ever happen.

Nice idea to leave a message for someone though. Maybe they could use
the /petition coding to send a '/petition' an offline PC. It's still a
lot of added information to hold until they log on, when you multiply if
up through the numbers of people playing.
