I've seen a bard do it .. He didn't explain it to me, but I know he didn't
charm any guards .. Somehow aggro'd the PoD, without getting hit, and the
guards killed the PoD (he took one down, but kept trying to nuke instead of
beating them senseless with his stick) ...

Saw a Robe of Dalnir on the Rivervale PoD a bit ago ..

Wish the AC on Wicker Tunic was 9+ .. Would have been cool to have him
wearing green leather. (He only accepted Gloves and Cap .. the bastard) ..
