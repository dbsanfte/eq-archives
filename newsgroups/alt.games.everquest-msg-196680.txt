If you think about it, imagine a bard who is allowed to have a travel 
song (Selo's) and a direct damage song playing all the time with no 
additional clicking required. You got it, zero work. Just run around a 
mob so he can't touch you while you watch him die. No hp or mana expense 
at all - no down time at all. I have a 40 bard, and have just started 
seriously looking into swarm kiting. I can tell you that the clicking is 
the only thing that keeps it from being a walk (run in circles) in the 
park.
