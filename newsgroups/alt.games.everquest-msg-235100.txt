Hi Robert;

Thanks for responding.  Yes, occasionaly I've seen and been a part of the
video lag running speed difference.  But this was truly disappointing. To
put 5 hard earned aa's into an ability and not be able to tell if you are
benefiting from it. Not to mention grinding out 10 more aa's to see if it
gets any better (which I wont). All other abilities I've put aa's in gave
back an immediate, noticable and for the most part rewarding ability.

Doctorzoid
