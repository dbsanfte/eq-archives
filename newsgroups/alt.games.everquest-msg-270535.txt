More likely is that they have a backout strategy, but this was not a 
situation in which that helps.  For example, here is one possible 
sequence of events that would give results like we are seeing:

1. They roll out a patch.  People play for a couple hours and serious 
problems are found (in this case, quests disappearing).

2. They roll back the patch.  That's not sufficient, though...all that 
will do is prevent further people from losing quests and whatever else 
was zapped for the people who played.

3. They roll back the database to restore the deleted quests.  Perhaps 
this is not really a roll back, but something more time consuming, such 
as restoring the database to an alternate DB server, and then 
selectively updating the character tables on the live database from the 
restored alternate, to try to restore the quests WITHOUT rolling back XP 
or items that people acquired while the bad patch was live.

4. They test with the restored data and the pre-patched servers, and 
find out the problem is STILL there--quests are disappearing.  Upon 
investigating further, they find that the problem was not due to the 
patch at all, but rather corruption in the database--it was just a 
horrible coincidence that this showed up right after a patch (anyone who 
works in software can tell you dozens of stories of coincidences like 
that).  So, they have to do a full rollback on the database (or, rather, 
restore from backup, after reinitializing the database). 

5. However, before that, they have to run a thorough check of the 
hardware to make sure it wasn't bad hardware that corrupted the DB.
