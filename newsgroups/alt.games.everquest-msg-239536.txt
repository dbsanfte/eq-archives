Str has a negligible impact on DPS.  Haste past about 31% has almost
no impact(*), HP increases the depth of necro/shaman mana-pools but
mana pool depth != increased sustained DPS.  Bards have the original
foci in game and benefit from haste/better weapons if they aren't
twistin chants (IE they are twisting singing based songs, or songs where
they have that instrument mod on a piece of gear.

(*) on haste - Haste cap at 65 is 100%, Vallon's Quickening is 68%,
therefore 31% haste puts you near enough to the cap (going the last
1% is worth a whopping .5% increase to melee dps.

Currently, pet classes have a significant portion of their DPS (ranging
from 30% to 50% depending on situation) stay static from being early 
60's with no AA to being time geared with 400 (the new pet aa's are
worth a 7% total pet DPS increase).

While waiting for a corpse summon in Barindu (don't ask) my naked BL and
naked mage duo'd the entrance mobs.  Mages in particular are pretty 
equipment independent - with the same effect you just named of being less
able to gain from it.

Bard power comes through versatility, everything else is just gravy.  The
same is true of BL's, it's the versatility that makes them so all-around
useful.  

BTW - my original main was a bard, and I have a bard alt on my current 
server.  He's the only character I've ever had who gets more tells for 
groups w/o LFG on than my BL.
