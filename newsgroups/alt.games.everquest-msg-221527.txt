Prismatic dye requires two skills to make. There is a brewing
trivial of 68 (another of 54 for another step, but that doesn't
make a difference really) and a pottery trivial of 54. Two of
the four required ingredients are only sold in the lighthouse
at Gunthak. Total cost for materials, about 29 plat, give or
take a little. OTOH, on the Karana server, it's usually sold
in the bazaar for between 40 and 50 plat per vial, lower if
there are a few willing to go lower.
