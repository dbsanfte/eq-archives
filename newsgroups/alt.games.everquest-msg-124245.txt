I agree that it is unlikely that someone used ShowEQ to know that Ragefire
is about to spawn.  Personally, given what I have gleaned from various
sources regarding Ragefire, I would guess that they had someone in zone, and
called in the troops when Ragefire did actually spawn, rather than knowing
it was about to happen.  The original post for this subthread, had
unattributed quotes from a variety of people in it.

Here is the text in question:

Here are some quotes from various idiots...
"Breaking the information down and translating it to the user, in my
opinion, is manipulating the information."
There is a difference between reading and writing data - sniffing
packets is not writing data.

"I have recently had the 'pleasure' of helping a friend camp ragefire.
 We sit there for days waiting for him and the uber guild using showEQ
(or something similar) zones in with a raid force about 3 seconds
*before* he pops."  As of a few months ago mobs are on random timers.
Seq does not have the ability to predict the exact time that ragefire
will spawn.  What seq does have is the ability to detect if ragefire
exists in the zone.
