Wrote to SOE a couple of days ago letting them know of my displeasure with
what I've read about the new LDoN expansion. Specifally that it seems that
the dungeons are only doable by parties with 5-6 members, thus leaving
soloers or smaller groups (my wife and I play) out of the picture.  This was
their reply:

    "Thank you for your e-mail, but we believe your problem to have been
    resolved.  If this is not the case, then please e-mail back."


What does that mean?  Have they changed it so all groups and soloers can use
the expansion now?  Was it my email that did the trick?  Hooray for me!!!
No, really...wtf?
