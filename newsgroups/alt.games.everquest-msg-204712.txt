Was thinking about that...No killing things
unnec..unecce..unnessa...Needlessly...Would that rule out the Wak quest
then? Tigers certainly don't attack me?
How about the Twilight Armour quests? Many of these involve killing Aliens
who are not KoS to me and certainly don't threaten anyone else unless
attacked.
Wonder how many other quests I would have to refuse to do on moral grounds.

TBH, it is the TS Quests that I really am not impressed with on these
grounds, as all of them, no matter what class, has a piece that drops off of
an Alien Race of some sort...

Paladin_01 Says "Hail Cral Ligi_0023. I know you mean me no harm and are
just curious about me but...One of your kind drops an Item I want and that
means I need to kill you all until he shows up"
Cral Ligi_0023 makes strange gurgling noises and continues to stare, wide
eyed, at this odd looking being with his small eyes and shining, beetle like
skin.
Thwack!
