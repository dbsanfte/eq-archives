sounds fun, is CC the only way to pay?  OT, in ac there is no zones and to
run around the border of the whole map would take about 4+ hours of nonstop
running.  But i have heard advantages about the zones, like running through
one to escape death :).  you said you don't lose anything but xp when you
die? but then you said you have to go back to your corpse to pick up your
equipment unless some high lvl player resurrected you, what lvl of player
and what class can do this?
