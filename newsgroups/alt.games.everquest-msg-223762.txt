Somewhere, under the 13th popup, is the item display for that Swarmcaller I
wanted.  I know that times are rough in the business, but crimony ... the
popups are spawning "Are you sure?" popups anymore.  AdAware can't keep up.

There's the rub.  I agree with you.  But what irritated me about the OP
enough to comment on it is that people unrealistically expect SOE to have
determined that the fault either is or isn't in their code within minutes of
the individual user having the issue.  Given the uncontrolled environment
that SOE releases it's software into, that's nearly impossible ...
particularly since my guess would be that the majority of users don't even
take the time to fill out a bug report.

They just come here and bitch about what crappy software and CS SOE has.
Like ~that's~ going to do any good.
