As stated, out of position. I've had some instances where he's been
standing inside the stone instead of in front of it and couldn't even
be targeted. Solution: petitioning him or otherwise pulling him back
to where he should be, which would be damned risky - I always petition
and move on. (He pays best of all the druid vendors, so I usually go
there to sell junk drops)

Hope you've gotten your spells by now.
