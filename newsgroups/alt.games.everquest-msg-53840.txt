They might want a SOW, but do not require one to get to their
body.

Its convenient, however, that since they are presumably naked
and have no money, you can't be expected to pay, and further
aren't likely to be sucking up the mana and time of people
repeatedly by asking for SOW after SOW.. that plus the
sympathy engendered by death leads suckers to SOW the
"for a CR crowd."

I've played melee characters before, yes, I know that
its a bit of a jog to the nearest bind spot.  Price you
pay, though, thats the way I look at it.

You'll never find me begging the zone for a SOW, for CR
or for any other reason, unless its actually -needed,- not
merely a convenience.

If I came up to you and said "I just died, can I have 10pp?"
would you oblige?  Is there a difference between asking
for a SOW or Port or even Revive and asking for cash?
Remember, a SOW potion costs 10pp, and can be stowed
in the bank in case you die.  If you "need" a SOW, and
beg for it, you are essentially asking for 10pp.  Might not
cost the person casting it that, but assuming you can't
cast it yourself, thats how much it would cost not to rely
on the kindness of strangers.

Since my cleric consumed literally thousands of PP in
SOW potions before purchasing his TBoots, I'm very
aware of the value of those "free" SOW's I've recieved
from time to time.

Now if I said "my body is in the middle of LFay in a brownie
spawn, I need SOW to grab it and get it clear" I can see
where there might be a connection.  But the generic (and
near constant) cries for "SOW for CR?"

Try asking those people to explain how it is they "need" a
SOW for CR.  Most of them are unable to come up
with a story at all, even an elaborate lie.  SOW for CR
is a begger's staple, noone questions it, and so it becomes
enshrined as a functioning element of the begger's tool box.
