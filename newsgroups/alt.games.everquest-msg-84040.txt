Succor is the druid level 57 in-zone group evac spell (also drains mana from
the group)
Egress is the druid level 52 in-zone personal evac spell (more mana cost
than succor)

Wizard versions are
Abscond (52) self evac
Evacuate (57) group evac (same group mana drain as Succor)
Decession (56) targetable evac (think of it as a targetable abscond/egress)
no mana drain like the group versions
