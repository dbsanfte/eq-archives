BUT, please please please wait half a tic for the chanter to actually say 
'I can't mez %T, get it!'  I can't count how many times tanks have taken 
it upon themselves to switch to the %T because they -know- you can't mez 
those... and break my mez.  Or wonder why they can't seem to hit my new 
pet.

The worst case was when I was on a raid in CT in 4C with two 60 chanters, 
and me, a lowly 55, and a Junge Raptor Thingy would add, and the main 
enchie would scream 'Ack! I can't mez A Jungle Raptor Thingy! Get it get 
it get it!' just as I was getting Glamour of Kintaz to stick.  Sigh...
