I have a level 54 ranger and a level 44 druid.
I love my wood elf druid because she can port herself and bind whereever she is
playing.
She can kite mobs, makes more money (off the mobs) and definitely levels
faster. 
She got SOW long before my ranger and has a good heal spell.
Her tracking and hitting suck and she can't shoot a bow and arrow.  But she
solos with ease.

My half elf ranger has GREAT tracking.  I can pick out the *named* and know
which is closest to me.  And how many of the mobs around me are *close by* and
able to kick my ass.  I use tracking all the time.  Every time I play.  The
large outdoor zones are heaven to me, I can pick my pulls easily - no wandering
around trying to find those nasty critters.
And she can hit and take a lot more damage than my druid can, but she can't
bind where she's playing.  And of course, she can't port.  But she got SOW at
30 :) and has root, snare, some *great* buffs and some crappy healing spells
that are far better than nothing, especially now with KEI.
My ranger was my also first character so I didn't have a lot of money.  I
didn't really start working on bow and arrow until she was around 45.  However,
you can pick up a bow and arrows killing in Blackburrow.  If I'd have had the
money for BAGS back in those days I'd surely have saved those arrows and
practiced more.  <-- That is advice should you start a ranger.
Of course now I make arrows for re-sale, not alot of plat in it but it's kinda
fun.   She can solo but is obviously slower at it, no kiting four mobs at once.
 But I *enjoy* soloing with her more.
So there you are.  Good luck on whatever you choose!
