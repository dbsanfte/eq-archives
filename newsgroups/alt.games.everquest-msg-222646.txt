    In single group settings, they have excellent utility and do a lot of
things. They also have stellar DPS should they choose to just unload on
something. On raids, you will likely be relegated to twitching because of
how important that is, because others can do your other utility functions
better than you can, and because your DPS usually has a lot of associated
aggro.

    You will CotH, you will cast mod rods, but when it comes time to fight,
you'll be doing what you've done for your entire career - DPS with pet and
nukes. Mages have a difficult time soloing the good content, but lower level
content is near-trivial. I have one friend that's gained over 30 AA's in his
low 60's just by soloing in Sebilis. But the same mage would have a much
harder time soloing in PoP.
