Druids not welcome in a Group at high levels ? Your crazy son.  Ive found at
63 that in PoV, PoN, or other tier 1/2 planes Druids almost seem PREFFERABLE
to a cleric. Our complete heal works quite well thank you at keepnig the
tank alive, and the addition of dots, ports, very decent nukes, and other
utility spells ( FoE, Regen, Mana Regen ( PoTC, PoT9), snare, root,
etc... ), makes a Druid almost to good for a group to pass up.

Im already nervous about the nerf thats GOT to be coming down the pipe for
Druids.
