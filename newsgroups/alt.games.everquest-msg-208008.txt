If you looked for this quest NPC the first day after the patch,
you didn't overlook him. He was missing and didn't appear until
the patch-to-fix-the-patch.

I dusted off my level 8 magician to give the quests a go. Great,
woven spider silk. Leveled him to 11 in Toxx, making sure to kill
every large/giant widow I saw. Got a total of two woven spider silks.
You need twenty for the full armor set. Good going, Verant. Yes, the
stuff can be bought in the bazaar but that takes the fun out of it.

At least the new mobs in Toxx make that zone viable up to level 11 or 12
as opposed to being virtually all green by 8 like it was before.
