You heard wrong. Wave based spells are only useful in *very* limited
circumstances, and at your level you're not likely to run into many of
those scenarios.

Pillar/column type spells are your friend to go with BoF, which is the
godsend of wizards. Stick with the best one you have, barring resist
issues, and avoid the Al Crap'Bor line.
