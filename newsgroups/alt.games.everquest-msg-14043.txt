    One thing I've wondered: at least on Rodcet Nife, over in Faydark/BB,
people seem to offer around 2pp per Crushbone belt.  However, over in East
Commons, I've seen Deathfish belts go for more like 5pp.  I'm not sure why
the disparity.  Are CB belts simply more common?

    I know of the two, I'd generally rather have the CB belts, as the
faction hits aren't as confused (all good except for Indigo Brotherhood,
making CB belts a bad idea for anyone who wants to go to Neriak now and
then).  DF belts, depending on where you turn them in, get you bad faction
with either the Freeport Militia or the Paladins (and good with the other,
of course).   Best way to avoid this is to turn them in in Misty Thicket
instead.

    But at 5pp per, I'd probably prefer selling them.  (Of course, there's
never anyone around offering that when I'm actually trying to sell any...)
