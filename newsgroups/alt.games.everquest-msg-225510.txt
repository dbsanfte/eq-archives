Contrary, yes EQ loves memory. 512MB can easily be eaten by EQ itself, but 
it also takes a lot of CPU power.

EQ keeps my processor (When I had Duron 750 and now XP 2400+) at 100% load 
all the time. In case I need a browser for doing some casterealm to check 
some details, I need to set IE to get more CPU priority just to keep 
browsing bearable.

After quitting EQ, Windows still got some trouble unloading a lot of the 
cache it has build up for EQ, A reboot is adviceable on slower CPUs in case 
you need to use other CPU demanding programs.

So I would say EQ is a good CPU stresser.
