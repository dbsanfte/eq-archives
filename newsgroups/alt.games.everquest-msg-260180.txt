It IS different, though. I can tell you right now the quests are sure
interesting the first time through, but think I'll give two shits
about them the third or fourth or tenth? It'll be as bad as grinding.

I stopped playing. I can't say what the camping rules are like there
now. Either they eventually came up with a non-forced camping rule...
or they didn't. However let's clear this up right away - DAoC doesn't
have a WoW style "my mob" system. My point was that the general
tendancy of the playerbase was to be able to take any spawn they got
to first (a la the WoW and EQ2 systems, just not formalized). So the
WoW system is reinforcing that this is okay. However, in practice, the
behavior it encourages is less desirable and rewards the wrong person
more, which is why EQ's non-official standard is the one that was
eventually most used, rather than first hit.

It would be *now*, though....

Technically I am replying to this *from* the sissypig (which I've had
subscribed for a lot longer), not age. :-p Besides, we'll all end up
together in another mmorpg someday - there'll be one three or four
years from now that will promise to do right all the things WoW and
EQ2 messed up and the cycle will repeat. The idea of yet more grinding
and raiding for progression in OoW scared the bejeezus out of me; the
cutting edge just keeps moving more and more and its so far from the
start point; I'm so tired of trying to catch up to it....
