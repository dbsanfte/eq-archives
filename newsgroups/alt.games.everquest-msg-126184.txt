The whole point of these toys are to let tradeskiller grandmasters
have a symbol of their speciality. And, while it is trivial above 250
to make the final item, it is perfectly possible to get a successful
combine below 250, at which point the skill modifier is useful. Every
single stat is meant to help a tradeskiller - high wis and int to give
more skill ups, stat boost to help with success rate, cha to give
better vendor prices, weightless bags for hauling heavy components
around.

This is not meant to be an item for Joe Average Player, which is where
the insanely high final combine trivial comes in. Buy an artisan's
seal if you like, but don't expect to be able to make anything of it
if you're not dedicated to your craft.
