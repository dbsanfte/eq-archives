How often does the VAB proc?  I don't think that's a high agro proc,
so I'd be surprised if putting Jade Mace (9/18) in your main hand,
with the Lamentation secondary, wouldn't help you hold agro.  For
proc'ing weapons you should care about the hate not the damage, so
a stun+dd proc or a poison proc (Black Blade of Tormenting:  9/22
plus a poison proc), to give a couple examples, is likely to work
better than a pure dd proc.
There's probably a lot of info on this at Warrior sites.
