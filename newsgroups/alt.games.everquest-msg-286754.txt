Ah, thanks.  Your clear, well reasoned arguments and cogent examples
have convinced me.  I just hadn't understood it that way before. 

 I had thought that ZG and Karazhan required skill, determination,
coordinated teamwork, and consistent play over a long period of time.
But based on all the data you've presented, they're obviously quite
easy, any 10 or 20 people can just walk in and master them.  Thanks
for enlightening me.
