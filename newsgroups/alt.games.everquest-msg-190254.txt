I have also had random lookups on a new pc. Would also occur if i left
the pc at the character selection screen. With Sony's help fixed the
problem. They suggested diasbling the sound card in the device
manager. To dramatic for me but one of the settings was for a game
controller (joypad). Turned that off and the lockups vanished. Hope
you sort the problem soon know how frustrating it can be.
