"Should users have a secure method to allow them to transfer ownership
of their account to someone else?

I don't care, Yes, No?"

I am absolutely, completely, 100% done with this game now. My
subscription is up in a few hours (cancelled a few weeks ago), and in
the 5 days before the end of it, I tried -desperately- to get the game
to be fun again, but to no avail. 

Not only that, but they put polls like this (and the item-whoring
poll), and I instantly lose what little faith I had in them to turn
the game around positively.

Fuck you, SOE. Fuck you up your stupid asses.

No, you can't have my stuff, because my account will no longer be
active very soon anyway.
