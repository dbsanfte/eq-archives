No - your the google jockey. Don't expect other people to share your NG
obsession.

Do not assume that you are normal and your views on who is pissing and
moaning and what is "legit opinion" are canon Biz. You are just one more
insignificant rodent like the rest of us.

Why thank you Bizbee, off you that is a compliment of the highest order.

Ten thousand US subscribers to every International one Biz? OK - that makes
roughly  40 non-US subscribers....  I guess that's one reason why your a
cook and not an accountant eh Biz?

Actually - at the moment I am laughing at _other_ idiots pissing and moaning
today. It's my turn tommorrow.

Just drooling, not blathering this time.

Actually, I wrote my post whilst at work, so that is what I found humorous -
me the "uninvited" (your word, not mine) not the slightest bit
inconvenienced whislt all the "invited" sitting at their computers checking
every two minutes. Good to see the shoe on the other foot occasionally.

Well - I used to find those things humourous but after a rather unfortunate
head injury I now find MMRPG's amusing.... : )

> Tell me, can you pee while standing up yet?

Err, I suspect I do not share your lavoratory related social activities and
prefer to keep my toiletry habits to myself if you don't mind...
