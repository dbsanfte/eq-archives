 Hey all, I'm on Bristlebane first of all. I've got a 44 Wizard that I have
pretty well ran into a stone wall with, I've got to group to get any more
levels...I've solo'd up 'til now, with the occasional group..but mostly
solo. anyway, I can still solo the hill giants, frost giants and few other
mobs, but it's gonna take forever to get 45. I'd like to put this toon in a
guild...any suggestions? Never been in a guild before, so it's gonna be new
to me. I've got a few other toons on the account as well, 65 Wood Elf
Warrior, and a 29 Ranger, and a newbie 12 druid. Probably just put wizzy in
guild for now...any suggestions would be appreciated.
