Thanks for the suggestions, guys, I will check them out and decide
which one I like best.  Thanks for the website StanMann, I've never
seen a zone guide as comprehensive as that one (I use Everlore
mostly).

I was checking through other possible zones, and I was wondering,
would Sol A would be a good choice, if I was grouped up with 1-2 more
people my level?  It looks like an interesting zone with some good
loot.
