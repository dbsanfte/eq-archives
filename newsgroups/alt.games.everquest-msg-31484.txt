Hi All,

Is there a reference for what DoTs/Buffs stack/don't stack for all
classes/levels?

Specifically - I just got my lvl 52 DoT 'Breath of Ro', a nice AC
reducer/912pt DoT. Is there any time I should Not cast it in a group? I
don't want to cancel out a more powerful DoT, or waste mana casting it if
it's not going to take due to another DoT.

But a reference for all stackables would be helpful.

Thanks

Drywit
