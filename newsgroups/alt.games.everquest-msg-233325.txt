Just to clarify a bit more....those buffs (Temperance and Virtue) are most
importantly HP buffs -- they boost AC as well but they add a _lot_ of HP.
And these buffs last for around a couple hours (exactly how long depends on
"Ext" factors), making them much prized. Virtue is better than Temperance,
but Virtue cannot be cast on anyone below level 46, Temperance can be cast
on anyone. Temp is a level 44 cleric spell, Virtue is a level.....59? maybe
60 cleric spell. Virtue is sometimes referred to as "HoV" (I think the
spell's full name is "Hand of Virtue") and Temperance is also referred to as
"Temp".

The key to KEI is again that it lasts quite a while -- I believe it's always
at least 2.5 hours, and can be well over 3 hours depending on "Ext" options.
However like Virtue, KEI cannot be cast on players below level 46. KEI is a
lvl60 enchanter spell. KEI is the third in the "clarity" spell line and
hence is also referred to as "C3". Chanters eventually get even better
INT/WIS/mana regen buffs ("C4" and "C5") but they don't last nearly as long
as KEI so what people are looking to donate for in the PoK is KEI.
