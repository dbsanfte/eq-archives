Well... It can be.  I had that cunning plan, once, and if I hadn't, my 
main wouldn't be a 65 enchanter. :)

}My main is a bst with obvious low Int and I want to work on smithing
}and jewelcraft then tailoring - with the Int I have (65) I seem to
}take forever.

Well, get yourself some wis gear.  High wis is just as effective as high 
int for raising tradeskills.  The chance of a skillup on any given combine 
is a function of the HIGHER of int or wis, so low int will not hold you 
back the least little bit.  And there is simply -scads- of good wis gear 
available for a beastlord for not very much money.  Get yourself a studded 
acrylia cloak (maybe 800pp, 10 wis), sleeves (4-500pp, 4 wis), and tunic 
(900pp, 8 wis), for a start.  chipped bone bracers (150pp? 5 wis).  gold 
jasper ears (50pp pair 3 wis each). velium jasper rings (250-300pp 7 wis 
each). Velium Ruby Veil (800pp, 8 wis).  Keep em in the bank, put em on 
when you tradeskill.  Some of those are even decent gear for a BST until 
level 55 or so. :)

But gads, don't worry about your Bst's int.  You don't need it to 
tradeskill. :)
