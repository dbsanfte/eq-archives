I have noticed a huge variance in the loot even within the same
adventure type although it stands to reason that the more mobs that
are killed the better it will likely be.

Last night my wife and I did a MM LDoN with a couple of Guildies and a
couple of random pickups (level range 61 - 65). It was a collect 21
which we breezed through in half the time. My wife was ML (being a BST
she often is) and I buffed her with CHA at the end to sell (making her
CHA 130+). Total split per person was a paltry 30pp each. We have seen
loots this low a couple of times before. Before she did the split I
suggested that we put a couple of hundred of our pp into the split
(plat is easy to come by for a 60+ Enchanter and I would rather spend
some of my own cash than leave people thinking that I have ripped them
off). We decided not to as it would have meant a delay while I went
and got some money so we did the split. One of the Guildies then
expressed some doubt as to the fairness of the split - implying twice
that this was so unusual that we must be ripping them off.

It just goes to show that even if you are honest you can still get
screwed by the RNG and leave people with the impression that you have
ripped them off! It also shows that, like in real life, sometimes you
should give people the benefit of the doubt.
