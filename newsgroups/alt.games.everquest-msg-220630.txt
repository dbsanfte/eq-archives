A funny thing happens as you level up.  Mobs drop more and more
cash, keeping pace (more or less) with the fact that it costs
more and more money to buy spells and misc gear.  Makes sense,
right?  Only at about level 40, this stops, mobs tend to drop
little more cash after this, not more.  At the same time, Hill
Giants drop -more- cash each than most mobs their level, if it
was as easy to kill them as, say, sabretooth tigress's in
Overthere, every player from 30 to 40 would be in Rathe Mountains
getting rich.

You may find mobs level 50 or 55 that drop more cash, but it
won't be more cash in the regular geometrical progression you are
used to from 1 to 35 (coppers, silvers, gold, pp, MORE pp), and
you won't be killing them all that fast.  But Hill Giants, when
you are level 50+, fall as easily as Orc Centurions do when you
are level 15.  They spawn fast (assuming you are clever enough to
kill off the various other members of their spawn cycle... and
those other members fall as easily as Orc Pawns do when you are
level 15), die fast, and give around 30pp plus gems and FS steel
each.  Its a simple, brainless matter to make a couple thousand
pp per hour killing them, risk free.

Is it possible to make better money?   Yes, but it requires
actual work, and usually not great exp, so many people go do the
great exp camps (that tend to drop less cash than those
aforementioned Orc Centurions) for exp, and then do a cash camp
killing greens for money.

The other way to make better money is off of drops; gem camps
like Seb bugs and so forth where you collect up stuff to sell to
vendors for a fortune, or items that sell well to players. 
Problem with the latter is that -if- you find a great spot, as
you farm it you introduce more and more into the game, so their
value tends to drop.  Unless you are soloing, it can be difficult
to split the loot well; farm a rare that drops once every few
hours at best and your group of 6 is going to have to roll for it
or something; this means that you won't reliably be making cash
at all, you just "might" make some.

Also, many of the "cash camps" aren't well known, while Hill
Giants are ingrained deep into the collective conciousness as a
way to make money

Since they suck as an exp camp for people the right level to do
them, this really doesn't bother me much at all; they are pretty
much tailor made for people who want to farm cash killing greens,
nothing else (except that I bring my characters in during their
high 20 and low 30s occaisionally to see whether and how easily
they can kill one, as a "benchmark")
