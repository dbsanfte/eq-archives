The Stone Thrower is a particularly nasty see invis mob that wanders NC from
time to time in the gullies. As you pass over the last bridge on your run,
if you are rather unlucky and the mob happens to be nearby the the gully
below, it's a pretty surefire way to get eaten. Hits for about 3k with a
2.5k melee stun proc type thing. Been chomped by this one twice. Once in
group when it added on a pull, once when running across the bridge and
getting within aggro range.

Other than that, I have had no problems running through NC by sticking to
the upper pathway and bridge and have not encountered a see invis mob on
that path.
