When people have given me advice in this newsgroup they often mention
that i should stockpile this or stockpile that make my way to the
Bazaar to sell it. (I have EVERY available addon for EQ). I recently
traveled there just to see what it was all about as it seems to be
(for people with access to it) an integral (butchered that word
horribly eh :ï¿½) part of making $$ in EQ. and upon reaching it i was
confronted with a ton of players peddling stuff. Now my first question
is when you're selling stuff in the bazaar do u have to stay online
while doing it (I only at most can play EQ for 2-3 hrs (gone up from
2hr max....) so am i going to have to grab a D&D book to read while i
sell off whatever it is i want to sell off while waiting? How long
does it roughly take before selling something (IE spider silks - low
level warrior hear - lvl 6!!)?? and what is the most effective way to
sell things (if applicable)? And lastly HOW do i sell things???

Thanks in advance for all help!
