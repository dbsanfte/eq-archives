We went there once.  I thought it was lame.  Different layout, many of the
same mobs.  Early on, its the old armor dropping mobs, abhorrents, spite
golems, etc.  These mobs drop the same stuff they always have, plus some new
quest drops for a ranged item.

Further in its a lot of the floor two mobs, agent of X, sage of Y, etc.
There was a giant DE named called a Deathrot Knight, was very easy.

Then we got to Maestro and he killed us.  We had 30ish.  He quadded for 1k
and proced/cast a big tap.  His fight has adds as well, 3 banshee things
that are not immediately targetable, then later some hands that regen the
crap out of Maestro while they live.  We died shortly after dispatching the
hands.  I hear the banshees later become targetable and ae life/mana tap,
but not sure.  I looked up some of his drops, he seems way hard for the loot
I saw.

No idea about Inny, except that I am sure he is now harder and also had his
loot 'upgraded'.  We also didnt fight any of the old minis, not sure if they
werent up or are located elsewhere in the zone.  It seems like a fairly
small zone.
