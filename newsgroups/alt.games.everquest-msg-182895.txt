Yeah, that would be an interesting challenge.  First thing that would have
to be done is make sure that players can't cause other players to die by
things like training.

Or, perhaps change the focus of the game from individual characters to some
larger unit, such as guilds?  Instead of you "owning" characters, the guild
"owns" them.  A guild of N people might have 2N or 3N characters.  If you
die, it kills off the guild character you were playing, but the guild can
recover the equipment (if they can get to the corpse, and you died in a way
that left anything to recover), and use it to twink a replacement.
