Well it is quite a bit more than that.
They need to check that there are the right number of each component.
Could be tricky if some components require multiples.
Not to mention checking that it is a valid recipy.
They need to work out the number of skill ups.
(Having first chosen the maximum posible number of skill ups)
They need to check if the item goes trivial half way through.
Do they give you a stack of the resulting item back ?
If the item does not stack what do they do ?
Do they drop your 20 plate helms on the floor ?
Try to stuff your inventory ?
Destroy any that don't fit ?
Have them all hang on your cursor ?

I would guess that they would want to put a delay in there (especially
if there are multiple skill up chances), in that case what do they do
about link deads ?
/petition I was makining 20 uber smithing items and went LD after the
first fail!

I think that you can see that this is non trivial code.

I think on balance I would prefer if they worked on the bazar's non
trivail code first.

HTH,

Jim
