I know that since the patch, I haven't yet had a lull-line spell resisted.
Admittedly I don't cast it very often.

Atone usually takes several casts to completely calm a MOB. It's hard to
tell whether it's resisted, but since I'm usually casting it to null
a MOB's hate list completely the "watch MOB facing" method is fairly
effective.

But then I'd gathered an impression that memblur was superior... maybe
just as a relative thing, i.e. seeing clerics as solely healers and
chanters as solely crowd control. Whereas root+Pacify+Atone is almost
as good as a mez now, although rather more time-intensive.
