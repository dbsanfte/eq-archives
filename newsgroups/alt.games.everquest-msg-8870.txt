I didn't say it was necessary, but it is a good way to bet.  There are
three major categories of character: Melee, Healer, Caster (and
hybrid)  When the original races were created, it made sense to
perhaps have some races that had no casters, but adding such
a race in as a new single would alienate a significant portion of
the potential buying pool for no particular reason.

It is quite possible of course that the new race has no casters... or
heck, no melee or no healers; its simple to make up a race with
any set you like.  What would be the point of doing so though?

Checked into it, and you are right.  So, the odds of that part
of my hypothetical list being correct go up.

Would be logical, as it would take care of the "why haven't we
seen these guys before" question.  On the other hand, it would
eliminate more potential customers who really aren't into non
human looking races.

I suggest they should get racial hide, sneak, safe fall and Instill Doubt

How about their stat base?
