Get your charisma gear on, if you have any, and do the Janam and Rebby
quests a few times.

Hail the Dark Elf Rogue trainer, tell her you'll help, she'll give you a
note to give to a halfling outside the Monk guild in the next zone.  Then go
down to the Dwarf rogue guarding the way to the Rogue guildmaster.  Ask him
'What message? (he doesn't respond to hails)...he'll have a message for you
to give to Janam, who is standing right next to the halfling Rebby.

Take back the stuff Janam and Rebby give you to the Dark Elf and Dwarf NPC
Rogues.  You'll gain faction with not only the rouge guild, but also with
the legitimate merchants in FP, too.  Do it several times.

The reason for the charisma gear, is that the higher your charisma, the more
positive faction you get from quests (and any negative faction is lessened
somewhat as well.)  You'll get more faction mileage out of the quests that
way.
