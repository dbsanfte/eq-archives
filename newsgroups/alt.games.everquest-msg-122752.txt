LOL.  Verse two:

Beggars and bozos and too-eager looters,
Bard bugs and group hugs and, sure, Wood Elf hooters,
Silver-white dragons to you on the wing,
Not all of these are my favorite things....

When the mob bites,
When the mob hits,
When the mob's real mad.

I simply remember that druid who died
And then I don't FEEEEEL (teedle dada dah) sooooo bad!
