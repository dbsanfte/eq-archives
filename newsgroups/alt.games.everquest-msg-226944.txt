If you arent near the desktop, just install from the disks, log in and
update. (OK stretches 'just')

Otherwise I think you should be able to just copy over the whole EQ
directory...I did that for my new machine by taking the HDD from the old
and puttting it in the new and then copying over before putting the old
HDD back and didn;t have any problems...just run a complete file check
when you first log in from the laptop to be sure you've got the latest of
everything.
