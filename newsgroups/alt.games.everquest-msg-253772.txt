I do, but it seems, you dont get the drift of what I am saying.  I FULLY 
understand the need for more buff slots at higher levels.  What my point is: 
WHY make it for only HALF the crowd? What is the purpose of the limitation? 
Your example above about going "somewhere else for awhile" rings true, but 
doesn't really have ANYTHING to do with my point.  I could also respond to 
your answer about 51+ with "Well, there is so much content in the game, that 
if said 65th level character cannot beat Mob X with 15 buffs, then go 
somewhere else and fight a mob that he can beat with 15 buffs" Both answers 
are correct, but mean absouletly nothing in regard to what is being 
questioned.  There is no logical reason to code a limitation into the game, 
most 51+ buffs cannot land on toons less than 46th, leave it at that ... do 
you honestly think having more buffs slots for people under 51 will make ANY 
difference right now? It doesn't.

Eq has a LONG history of making Group A suffer, so that group B can be 
happier.  When giving the same benefits(in this case buff slots) to ALL 
groups doesn't hurt anyone at all ...
