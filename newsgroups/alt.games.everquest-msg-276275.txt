I am a DON newb. I know that there are good and bad factions. I know
that they have LDON type instanced zones. I have done three crawls
that gave me some crystals and a stone to turn in. Even after three
turn ins I am still apprehensive to the trader guy. There are rumors
that once I get enough faction, I can start getting progression tasks,
but thats all the details I have been given. 

Is there a good source for information of these tasks. What do I do
first. How do I fix my factions? Did killing in Broodlands, Stillmoon
and Thundercrest make this harder?

Rumor has it that progression completion leads to 2aa and some stat
bumps and stat cap bumps. But, all of this information is non-spefic
in /OOC from people I dont know.

Basically, I'd like to find out more. Any help appreciated.

Ken
