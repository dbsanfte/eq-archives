Ah, now *that's* a very different kettle of fish. Outside the tunnel you
leave the comfy safe valley and come into the *real* Dreadlands.  Safe
at 31? Not on your life. Can it be done? Sure, if you're careful, and
particularly if you have a SoW, Lev and Invis, it could be a cakewalk as
long as you're alert. Hell, we've run naked level one characters to
Thurgadin. Anything's possible that's not level/key limited. But no, DL
is no picnic at 31. Be careful out there. :-)
