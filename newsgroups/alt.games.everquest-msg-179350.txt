Several of you are having problems with windows missing from the UI,  like
the spell gem bar and bazaar window since the last patch.  It seems that
anything that was partially offscreen in your regular set-up is subject to
disappearing altogether.  I had this problem tonight with my buff bar.  I
was able to correct it by reloading the default UI by typing in /loadskin
default.  This reset all of the window placements to their default position
and I was able to reposition them so that they were fully within my window
boundaries.

See if this helps.
