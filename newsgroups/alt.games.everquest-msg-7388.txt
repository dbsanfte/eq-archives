Does anyone have any experience playing one?  It looks cool as hell to me, but
I wanted to know if anyone has tried it.  Someone suggested making the Halfling
and dumping all 25 points into agility, to make it 125.  This would leave
str/stam at 80 and 85, which seems insane for a warrior, but then again the 125
agility would make him get hit a lot less (or would it?)  Just looking for some
feedback on what people think of this race/class combo?
