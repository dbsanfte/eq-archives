Um at level 19 you can 'Master' a skill. If his alteration is average its
probably about 50ish... Choose a low level/low cost spell that is alteration
and have him chain cast it over and over and ad nausium... this will
increase his Alteration skill slowly but will be easier than chain casting a
spell that costs as much as ports...

fyi this is why it pays to keep all skills maxxed
