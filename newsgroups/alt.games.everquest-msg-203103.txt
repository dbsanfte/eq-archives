I'm sure you're right that players have come up with all sorts of
tactics SOE never considered.  However I think the soloing
community is big enough that SOE attempts to cater to them to some
degree.  EQ can be a pretty good "single player in a multiplayer
world" game.

I think you're right re: carrot vs. stick.  What will be really
interesting is to see what they've done with the classes in EQ2.
Presumably they'll have balanced the classes more towards what
they want for EQ but can't.  If EQ2 has a few good solo classes
we'll know SOE is also targeting that segment of players.

I'm happy I never went looking for KEI: no withdrawal symptoms!
