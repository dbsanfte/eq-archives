Few things I noticed about the new engine and in some cases, I think a few
people are looking in the wrong place for bottle necks.

* Textures: I think the slow downs in frame rate related to the new
textures is minimal. The texture load in a scene in something like quake3
I bet is much higher then most of the places you'll go in EQ. The only
time texture load (Meaning pushing a lot of textures across the AGP bus)
should be an issue is when you got a ton of people in your view. If you're
card supports it, texture compression should speed things up nicely
because it means more bus bandwidth. What I think causes the crappy frame
rate are the add in objects and the way the engine now renders a scene. It
would seem the "don't render stuff the player can't see" isn't quite 100%
true. For example, WFP used to be around 40fps on my machine with a 32 meg
TNT2 card. Now it's around 15 or even less in some parts where I'm looking
into the city. I'm guessing it's rendering stuff BEHIND the walls you can
see and "add in" objects like pots, stuff on walls, statues, etc. People
with 32meg cards should have no problem running in the medium textures. I
think the most texture heavy map in quake3 has scenes where your card is
swapping in around 80 megs of textures across the AGP bus and getting
good frame rate. Of course we're comparing one of the best 3d engine's vs
one of the worst.

Zoning: New textures would make this take longer of course. I'm guessing
the stored the textures in the highest quality then render then to your
selected quality when you load the zone. This is where the texture cache
would improve stuff.

Mip Mapping: I don't know why this would be a memory hit since most cards
can do this in hardware... but who knows with the EQ way of programming.

I don't understand what they did to make things WORSE in a walled city
like Freeport where you should get BETTER frame rate with an engine that
doesn't render stuff you can't see. Those guys need to hire someone who
knows 3d programming and get them to fix stuff up. Like John Carmack or
something.

A game that makes this munch money should be able to licence some nice 3d
technology or even hire someone to make it.
