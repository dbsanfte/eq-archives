Ok I call Bullshit.

I have killed as a bard many more PH than as a druid simply because of
manna. Druids can be the biggest pain in the ass in the whole zone
minus rogues. They pull with snare and wonder why people grab the
giant. Chanters on the other hand NEVER kill PH, seriously have never
seen a chanter kill one. 

Point is asses come in all classes so stop this bullshit. Jealous of
bards then start one. Otherwise get over it.
