I've picked up a ton of the quest pieces just wandering around.  They've all
come off of "named" mobs.  The name difference can be subtle.

Just looking at a random example from Allakhazams, the quotes are: "The
Oiled Scales drops from a "Nasty Zelniak" (seriously, thats the name!) in
Dawnshroud Peaks" and "Has anybody been able to locate where the Mark of
Discpline drops? *Edit* I've located it. Off the Shik'Nar Guardian in Mons
Letalis. It's a rare pop, like the others."

So Allakhazams isn't necessarily wrong, people are just confused.
