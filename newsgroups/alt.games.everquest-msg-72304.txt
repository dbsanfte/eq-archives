>>i installed velious. now when i hit 'i' instead of getting the nice inventory, its like got all my stuff but like in a black table, not the nice old blue squares lay out. Up side is u can see thru table so nothing sneaks up, but i hate look of it. If u right click an object text overlaps onto ur money bar so text is messed up as backgrounds are like smokey colour almost transparent. can u revert to old, pre velious display?

OK, this must be bad.  I was actually hoping that DarkTyger would
flame this guy, and generally I think DT needs to take a Valium.
Sheesh, it's not bad enough that you can't be bothered to fucking
spell out 'you', but you must post in some fucked up way that ensure
that a significant percentage of us can't even read your post.  I bet
you run around saying 'SoW plz!', 'j00 PL me suXX0rs', and '1'm 5o
733t!'  Please learn to post like a proto-human at least.  Or go play
in traffic.
