}Actually that's exactly what I was trying to point out. You bet you

}Of course, SOE won't easily have access to that data, so in a sense
}that makes you somewhat safer (if you remember to release/renew your
}IP every time you switch between the accounts).

Yeah, well, honestly, I haven't remembered to switch regularly so -that- 
account at least, is tainted.  Oh dear!  But still, yes, if they'd have to 
subpoena my ISP for the data, I'd feel pretty safe. :)

}But I still firmly believe they can ID you. I don't know this, but if
}I was the programmer writing the login code for SOE, part of what I'd
}silently transmit to login would be an ID that uniquely identifies
}your computer (processor ID, mac address, windows product id, class id
}of your control panel, EQ cd key codes... anything that's very
}unlikley to change). But who knows. 

Yea, and therein would be the importance of having the 
account-to-do-bad-things-with routinely log on from an entirely separate 
computer.  With a different windows version installed and EQ installed 
from a different set of discs, since I have like 3 of each at this point 
anyway. :)

I don't use PIII's, so there isn't a processor ID in any case.  I'm pretty 
sure they're the only ones you gotta worry about that with, unless the 
issue just went underground.  But tell me if you know different. :)

}I still doubt they'd actually
}follow this trail unless you do something monumentally bad, at which
}point they'd just supoena your identify from SBC/Yahoo anyway.

Aye, but just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get me!
