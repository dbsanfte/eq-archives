Quite simply I (or others) can make the Artisans seal for others if they
don't have pottery and jewelcraft up high. It is up to the recipient of the
end trophy to make the final combine.

For Jewelcraft the final combine is done in a jewel kit and requires the
Seal +glass shard +silver bar

I did it at skill 246 plus a gem setter geerlock

The final combine recipe is different for each trade skill but the Seal
component  remains the same.

Blue Diamonds were as low as 500pp on Xegony (don't know about other
servers) but price has shot up to around 1000 - 1300pp cos so many trade
recipes are now using BDs as a component.
