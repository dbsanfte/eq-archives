	*cheering is heard* Welcome back Richard!

	I just came back from a six month break myself, and would you believe 
it migrated FROM povar to join an Australian guild (woot! raids in my 
own timezone!) who accepted me as a 'casual' member because I lacked the 
flags they demand. Many parallels there.

	In this case though, the flags they want are simple elemental access, 
which I don't have as my previous guild generally fielded 30-40 people, 
several of which were often as low as high 40's. For the last few 
months, we also lacked a high level warrior, and split tanking between 
the guild's top Paladin and myself (SK). We never had the faintest hope 
of going elemental on our own, but we did some things which I still 
regard as pretty amazing, given our limitations. (TT for example, 
several epic 1.5's and lots of people Tipt flagged)

	Spooky logging into a different server isn't it! Everything *looks* the 
same but is *called* something else. The biggest problem I've had so far 
is that camps are called different things, and people *aren't* 
understanding of level 70 folk who have no idea where 'cubby 1' is in 
WoS but can pull it as though they've grouped there a dozen times before...

	The guild I wanted to join at least accepted me as a lower-ranking sort 
of member (they insist 'casual' is not lower rank, but as you can't bid 
on most loot and are lower priority to take on raids if they are full - 
which is often, I can't see it any other way). At least having a guild 
tag lets me get groups easily, and often get into raids and see the new 
content, help my guildmates gear up and rack up my own points against 
the day I might be able to spend them :)

	As a tank without a guild tag, I found grouping very, very difficult. 
We're a very gear dependant archetype, and few people will take a chance 
on a guildless tank.

	I tried that tack, but nobody wants Endure Disease :(

	On Povar 'C3' and 'KEI' are used interchangeably, although C3 more 
often. Can't imagine people at level 70 not actually knowing what 'KEI' 
is - although I have to admit, the frequency of 'ebayers' is going up 
and up these days.

	Here's the value of you posting here: more relevant information 
actually about DoN, the missions, and faction (I have yet to play this 
expansion's content so I've no idea) than I've seen anywhere else.

	Welcome back ;)

Cheers,
