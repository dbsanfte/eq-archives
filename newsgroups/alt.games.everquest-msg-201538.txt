Well, I can tell you how long it took me.  I have a level 47 bard and
I have not been power-levelled or twinked.  I have about 20 days
/played on the bard, which is my main.  I don't think that's too bad
for a bard not power-levelled or twinked.  Maybe it is.  I know
similar players that have about 6 days played on their level 47
character but that's usually because they have a guild power leveling
them or they are two-boxing with a higher level alt.
