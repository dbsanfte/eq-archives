OK, I see that the patcher is skinnable. everquest.com even says it is...
I'm trying to make a skin for my guild, but everything I do is undone as
soon as I launch. The patcher sees "Hey, these files aren't what we sent
last time. Let's resend them!"
I've changed the .xml file. I've changed the pictures, I give up.
Anyone succesfully skinned the patcher yet?
Thanks for the help in advance.
