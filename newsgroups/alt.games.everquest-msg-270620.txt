They are German games,as Michael wrote comparable to MW,deleted
Gothic 1 from my  hard drive after trying 15 minutes vainly to climb a
ladder.
Another "hyped" one from Germany recently is "Sacred",kind of a Diablo
clone,funny,the maximum resolution is 1024 * 768,kills it for me,but
gameplay looks interesting if you can live with that.Oh,and it does
not run with the latest Nvidia drivers needed for EQ,you need an older
Version (56.64 or so),otherwise it will crash with a bluescreen,as
this wasnt enough,it corrupted my driver Nvidia  at the same time,so
I needed to reinstall.Furthermore it needs Win98 SE,this is a joke
too,demanding newer OS *and* older drivers,lol.So far I was doing fine
with Win 98.

Way off Topic,I know,but at least the 2 letters EQ occure once.  :)
