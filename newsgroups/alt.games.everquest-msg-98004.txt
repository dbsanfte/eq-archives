It's a combat ability. When you press it you might get to hit the target
for a point of damage. Never more than that and you'll mis a lot because
you can't train skill in it like a warrior can. On the other hand it might
interrupt a spell caster if you time it right, and it's not like you have
other combat abilities to get in the way.

> 2) What weapon proficiency is best to work on: 1HB, 2HB, 1HS, 2HS?

The shaman epic is piercing if you see yourself going that far. And
shaman don't get 1hs and 2hs. For myself I use 2hb when I'm assisting
and want to lay down some damage. The rest of the time it's spear
and shield because it looks damn fine. I still do some work with 1hb
in case I find and uber 1hb, but more classes want those than want
piercers.
