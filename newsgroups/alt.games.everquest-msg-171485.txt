Simple anser is NO

It's not your system. Even the highest level systems lag in the
bazaar. More system and/or video RAM would help, but it's really not
worth it. The problem is a combination of things....

1. The total number of players in the Bazaar at any one time (300+ on
most servers). 

2. The size of the zone (it has an arena as well as the player vendor
area)

3. The texturing and scenary (barrels,  wall sconces, etc)

All of that together is a HUGE hit on any system.

To avoid lag in the bazaar try the following....

1. Set Clipping Plane to 0
2. Stare at a wall or the ground. (only look up to navigate around
objects)
3. Use the search function to find items, then right click on the
vendor neme to home in on them.
