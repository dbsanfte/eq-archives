He was a moron for expecting *her* to wait?  15 minutes?  After she'd kept
him hanging for an hour plus by her own admission?

Actually, I agree with that.  I wouldn't have bothered after the first 15
minutes when it became apparent that the person didn't actually seem to want
to make a deal.  Or, as you put it, he was a moron for not saying "I'll give
you 2k?  Deal?  If not, I'm going to get back to playing and wait for the
next one I see for sale."

I'm admittedly impatient when it comes to making deals.  I'd rather over pay
and get what I want when I want it.  In my experience, I'm not uncommon in
this opinion.

Perhaps.  Perhaps, like me, he will completely abandon the auction channels
and zones and use the Bazaar exclusively.  (Where I've bought 3 bracers of
the hidden over the past month for 100 pp each.)  I have a feeling Bazaar
isn't nearly so active on FV as it is on all the other servers though.

Most people aren't interested in playing a trading/market game.  They're
interested in playing an adventure game, otherwise they would have bought
Stock Market Tycoon.  Spending an hour to get an item for market value isn't
the game most people signed up to play.
