I think of it this way - the XP bonus for a 5 man group is 14%
IIRC, that means each person gets just shy of 23% of the xp 
value of a given mob.  Now, add a 6th person, the bonus goes up
to 20%, meaning each person gets 20% of the XP value.  So,
given that you're not spawn limited, all the 6th person has to
do is increase the kill rate by 15%.  To me it's a no brainer
to add the 6th person.

Of course, we add friends and guildmates to our group even when
we can already handle all the available spawns in our camp with
less than a full group - It gives us more flexibility and we
have a good time - more important than the absolute most efficient
xp grind.
