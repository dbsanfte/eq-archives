Sure you can do both at once. Level up 50%-75% of your time, devote the 
rest of your time to helping the guild. Adjust those numbers as desired.

There are bad representatives of both crowds, those who are too quick to 
criticize others and those who are too reluctant to help.

Point taken. However, I read a couple of other posts here talking about 
getting flagged with as few as 4 people and with less than the best gear 
available for others.

This is no more than cause of guild splits than EQ is the cause of 
divorces and suicides. If the guild lacks the loyalty and cohesion to 
stick together and make it happen, that's just the way it is.

Yes, I guess I do view it that way. I feel some sort of qualification

IMHO, it would be better to fix that than remove the trial requirements.

Only if the guild determines that to be their direction. Otherwise, 
continue playing as before until you get there.

If you "just wanted to have fun playing together with [your] friends..." 
then it shouldn't have been a problem to continue playing in the zones 
you could until you were all more trial-ready, should it?

Why force it? Play at your own pace until you get to that point.

I don't know. It seems to me from some of what I've read that it's 
possible without being a huge raiding guild.

It wasn't personal. If the shoe fits, wear it. If you have plenty willing 
to help, then there shouldn't have been too much of a problem.

However, the fact that it does fall apart in some circumstances does not 
mean that it is flawed or something to which we should not aspire.

Sure, within the realm of possibility provided a freak string (hundreds 
of thousands I would guess) of missed attacks and fizzled spells from 
Vox. Of course that example is of the extreme and not at all in line with 
the level of probability involved in what I've proposed.

Not that it *does* happen this way, but that it *should* happen this way. 
If everyone in the guild were of like mind and dedication, it would. I'm 
not talking Borg-like like-mindedness either, just a common interest 
shared by the vast majority.
