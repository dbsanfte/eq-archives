As for the comment of this not being a democracy I would say posting
on the usenet seems to follow the anarchy form of government more than
any other type.  If anarchy can be called such.
So even though I've been using the usenet since it was uunet, because
I disagree with your choices I'm branded a noob.   A conclusion which
speaks volumes about the poster's cognative ability.
