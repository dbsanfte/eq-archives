I hate shopping - except for in the bazaar.
But I *have* used a steak knife for a box cutter, and a can of corn as a
hammer.  Metal nail file = screwdriver.  Manicure scissors = *tiny*
screwdriver.  And I once used my old blender as a paint stirrer.  So yeah, I
understand cooking supplies / power tools :)
My score was *we are 67% sure you are straight*.  I think my soap answer is
what confuzzled them.
