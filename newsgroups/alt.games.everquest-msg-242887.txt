The fact it was just begging to start flames. I'd say, in fact, that
it is partly responsible for the 'biz/dt are gay' troll that came
later.

I'd say that posting a thread titled "You're gay" in a newsgroup is
akin to filling your front yard full of lavishly painted lewd
mannequins all in the process of performing various acts of copulation
with each other. Sure it might be funny, will definately catch
people's eyes, but won't do much for property values or impress those
just driving through....
