Its sad, but you do have a bit of a point there.  If you really want
a fair share of the loot, then you need to run a loot order, and
roll out the valuables.  (loot order is faster than roll everything,
and if you are worried about the plat, its the only way to be
sure you are getting your fair cut)

Most interesting to me are the actual usable items; I once
was fighting in a Seb group when a Donal's Helm dropped.
Well, I knew I was the only cleric in the group, so I knew
that was going to be mine... but they were MLing and
splitting at the end.  In this case they were honest, and
we did split goods at the end; also it turned out that the
helm sucks.  BUT if it had been good, why would you
want to finish out the evening with me less powerful than
I could be?
