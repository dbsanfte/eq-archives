Right now, I've been seeing HQ Bear pelts on Sullon Zek got for around 3-5
pp, and Tailor made backpacks going for 30pp at the most.
Banded in Everfrost has been going for around 1pp per ac (or slightly less).

The reason?  Most people are so dirt poor, they can't afford a lot of stuff.
If player merchants want to sell their wares, they have to drop the price to
match what the local market can afford.

I'm sure the economy is a little different depending on the city and region
as well.  With the cities and teams more isolated from eachother by war
zones, different regions are developing their own economies.  In Western
Antonica and Odus, things like Tailored Backpacks are luxury items at a time
when most are still scrambling for basic equipment.

In some ways, this has been VERY healthy for some of the trade skills.  I'm
seeing many of the forged and cultural weapons being bought and sold in
/auction.  Plus, I'm sure anyone who can sew studded or reinforced leather
can become quite popular with the druid crowd.  That's usually not the case
on the other servers.

On the other side of the coin, some of the smaller items (like the 5hp
alligator tooth earrings from the Qeynos Catacombs, and the Rat Shaped
Rings) are going for slightly higher prices than normal.  There's a high
demand for anything useful, available, and magical in Western Antonica.
