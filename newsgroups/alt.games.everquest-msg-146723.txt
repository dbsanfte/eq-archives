I've had mobs that are being quadded smack me once or twice as they slowly
move past me.  They don't stop, just take a couple of potshots.  It's only
happened in DL so far, and only with Brutes that I can recall.  I was busy
root rotting a cockatrice, at the time it happened, so it wasn't a social
agro issue.  Personally, I would feel no compunction at all about rooting
the offending mob, and rotting it as well.
