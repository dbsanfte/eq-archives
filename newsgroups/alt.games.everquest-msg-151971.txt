One of my old guild mates came back, after 8 Months absence and was amazed
to find that, not only did he still have all his characters intact but also
the (dying, even then) Guild he left was still around...if not active (it's
actually around because 4 us have enough acounts to keep it that way...I
think there are actually on 6 players in it) so with luck should be ok. From
what I've heard, deleting accounts is exception not the rule and most
players still have complete accounts after a year or more away.

I thought you passed Nev on to someone, CK? I'm certain I've seen the
Character in EC (Pre Bazaar) a while after you quit.

CF
(it's an unwritten rule that ex-ukq2 players must use initials as names and
the first one must be C :ï¿½))
