Something more accurate than guessing would be nice.

You keep saying 1-10 is trivial, but repeating it doesn't make

I think you've forgotten what it's like to be a new player.

If you're not sure how they could make levels 1-10 "more trivial",
you're not using your imagination.  Off the top of my head: they
could make 1-10 "more trivial" by advancing all your skills to
the previous level maximums when you ding.

Frankly I find the claims that 1-10 is too easy exaggerated.
1-10 is plenty challenge for a new player, hardly trivial
considering how much there is to learn, and experienced players
starting alts probably aren't too interested in 1-10 anyway.
