I see a lot of people who figure they can just sit in their cosy little
group and beg clarities, while I sit around LFG. I had a good one last
night... a pally was forming a group but after 5 minutes decided he "didnt
want to wait around for a healer" once I have him clarity... so off he goes
to solo. Its hard to have a generous nature when people are constantly
trying to take advantage of it.

As for people I dont know send me tells, and not offering any $, they get
put straight onto ignore. Quick easy solution. Much easier to ignore them
that way.
