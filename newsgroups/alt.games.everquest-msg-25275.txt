Depends entirely what you mean by neutral.
I guess that a lot of people opinions of alignment come from AD&D.

Sideing with the underdog / maintaining the balance of good / evil
sounds like "Lawful" Neutral
Lookng out for pure self interest (without breaking too many rules) is
"True" neutral.
While I have seen "chaotic" neutral diffined as anything from "mad" to
totally selfish.

I'm not sure that anyone ever fully understood the AD&D system, but it
does seem to have coloured many RPGers thought processes.

Humm.
