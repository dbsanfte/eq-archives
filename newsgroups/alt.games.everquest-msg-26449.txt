You really should try running a shammy or druid. Shammy up to 9 and druid to
14 so they have cure disease and SoW. IMO they are a huge amount of fun to
run in game for their own sake while they will expose you to more of what
people are talking about with begging.

EQ is like a shit sandwich: The more bread you got, the less shit it seems
like you have to taste. Bread being positive experiences you have with great
people in a great game and shit being the idiots. Everyone's taste buds have
a difference tolerance for the levels.

Two recent cases that I can't forget.

I am in the Evil Eye Gorge running to Rivervale via Runnyeye. The entire
trip I keep getting tells from some kid "Plz power level me!" and in
response to "no" I get "Could you buff me then, Plz, Plz, Plz!". So he is at
the entrance to Runnyeye. I cast SoW "That spell would not have stuck", I
cast a strength spell "That spell would not have stuck", I cast an armor
spell "That spell would not have stuck". IOW, he was fully buffed with every
spell in the book and still pleading for more. I did a /ignore on him.

I am running about N Karanas and there are about 10-15 shouts from a warrior
"can ne1 cure disease plz". I figure probably just a new character so I

/ooc You know you can just walk up to the second floor of the tower and give
the NPC 5 gold and he will cure you.

Five more /shouts "can ne1 cure disease" from him and I /ooc "OK, where are
you". He responds "at the spires" which is maybe a 15 second walk to the
second floor of the tower. I run down and cure him anyway.

This situation was repeated not 10 minutes later with an enchanter. Same
exact thing with me telling them to just use the tower. Finally I cured them
and decided to give it up and loaded my magician. I saw someone /shout "can
ne1 bind at gypsies?" and sure enough, Mr Enchanter runs there and charges
the guy 10 pp to bind him.

I think my magician got rabies about 5-10 times that night. Every other
freaking thing in the zone has rabies, I am surprised the bugs don't carry
Lyme Disease. Everytime I picked up another case of rabies I just crossed
the zone, went up to the 2nd floor and paid the NPC 5 gp. It still works.

I had a great time with my magician that night, less so with my druid. Same
player behind the character, same zone, same idiots in the zone. It is the
taste bud thing, some people have a higher tolerance then myself.

"Ill gladly help newbies, especially in neriak where i can guide them to

That is a good start. If I see someone asking for help finding a corpse and
you respond, it will be hard to avoid getting a SoW from one of my
characters if you pass within spell range. If I catch you asking for free
cures vs paying 5 gp, then charging someone 10 pp for bind no amount of
begging will get you one.

There are dozens of spells that help people out. Someone snares something
for me vs a direct damage spell, they may get a SoW. Someone like a necro
cast clinging darkness or fear on a mob that is knocking the crap out of
me<vs DD>, they may get a SoW. I am down on life fighting a mob and a low
level ranger cast minor healing on my chr, he will get a SoW. I see a naked
guy running across a zone on an obvious corpse run, I get a few hundred
yards in front of him, then hit him with a SoW while he is on the run. I'm
sitting wounded and oom and a cleric heals and buffs me, they get a SoW.
