I'm looking for some programs; ShowEQ, Newer version of EQ Zone Explorer
(The one I have seems to no longer work. Is there a work around for it?),
Newer version of EQ Watcher.

If you have a link for them just post them please or e-mail if you have the
program itself and don't know the url.

If there's something you're looking for let me know, I have tons of EQ
movies no longer around and alas only one song do to hard drive failure but
I'm working on that.

If you haven't guessed I like collection all things EQ and try to keep them
up to date. =)
