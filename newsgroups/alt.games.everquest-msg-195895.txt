On the other hand, get Velious quest legs (or I think drop legs in POG) and you
get a clicky version of the same spell.

When the mana cost is zero, that 100 points each heal suddenly looks like a
much better deal.

Get a horse and you don't lose med time "casting" it, and you are suddenly
600hp a minute regen for your whole group.

Of course then you go to POP and find that completely inadequate.  Pity that.
