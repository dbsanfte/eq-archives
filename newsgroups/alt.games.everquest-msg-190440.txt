EQ Traders list Spinner in West Karana as a source of various smithing
items, but he spends all his time away from the listed location and
refuses to trade.

Since I made the haul out from Qeynos specifically to buy a file mold
and he was looking towars the mountains, I went up the mountain and
found a group of bandits, which I killed, hoping that might trigger him
into trading. No luck. Ended up killing a 2nd lot of bandits (3/5
different), but still he won't trade.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to get him to trade?
