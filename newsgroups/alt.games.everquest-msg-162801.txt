This is only really related to EQ in that the box that pops up is dang
annoying when playing EQ.

Anyway, within the last few months there is some new "feature" of Windows XP
(totally guessing that it is Windows related and not some ad program) that
pops up a Dialogue Box titled Messenger Service with ads for anything from
loan consolidation to porn.  When this happens while playing EQ I get the
wonderful phantom mouse pointer from my desktop which is mildly annoying.
When pulling up the Task Manager, the process related to this box is
csrss.exe which is identified as a critical system process and cannot be
terminated.  I have searched my hard drive for a file under this name and
nothing comes up (not that I expected one to, since it is a process and not
a full out program) so I can't seem to figure out where it comes from.  I
have tried completely removing MSN Messenger from my computer and searched
my registry for MessengerService and removed all entries (one of which was
part of MSN Messenger) and still I get the popup.  I've run ad-aware
programs and virus checks to clear anything that could potentially be
causing it, and even after totally cleaning the system, the popup still
rears its ugly head.

I'm wondering if anyone else has encountered this and on what operating
systems.  Also if anyone has found a way to get rid of this program I'd love
to know it.  Also as a side note, can anyone find a way to prove that this
is actually coming from Windows itself?  Would be interested to know that,
cause damn would that make a fun case in court.  Windows Implements Software
that Advertises Porn.  You all see where this could go, right?

According to that Cringly article in a recent post here, the Windows EULA
was changed to allow adware program type things to be implemented, tracking
our spending habits, etc.

I swear, if EQ ever comes out for Linux I'm making the jump.  :)

Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated.
