The Queens are the only ones that drop GIANT fire beetle legs.
Queen Klaknak in Misty thicket and Queen Klicnik in North Qeynos.
To get the queens to spawn kill the warriors and the Prince and Princess.
Queen Klicnik in North Qeynos is easier to get to spawn. Be aware that
the Queens are level 9 or 10 and are spell casters.
