Theoretically allowed by Christian views at best. That doesn't mean its 
practical. Even if they were allowed to kill a class of sinners, the 
practical difficulties in actually identifying them precludes them from 
killing anyone. 

And its dubious whether killing people at all is allowed, given that the 
faith indicates their duty is to forgive not to judge.
