Offhand with a 5 skill in dual weild?  He could be using a 50/20
weapon and it wouldn't make a bit of difference in his DPS,
since he'd only swing the thing a few times per battle.  I admit
that with delay same, higher damage would be better.. .but
not much better, not till his skill comes up.

Is it?  Can you site sources for that?  Explain why its
wrong?  Anything?  Because I've read over it a few
times based on your statement... and it doesn't look
wrong to me.

Dual Weild happens on offhand weapon delay, yes?

Dual Weild "happens"  means
a) Check to see if dual weild skill goes up, yes?
b) Check dual weild skill to see if weapon can swing, yes?

If and only if dual weild skill says swing:
a) Check to see if skill in weapon goes up, yes?
b) Check against weapon skill to see if you hit, yes?

IF those are all yes, then what I said is right.  If there's
a no in there, well, I'll be surprised and look for confirmation.

I agree, was trying to make the case however slight for the beak...
but 2 dex just isn't going to be visible.

His DPS with the fungusbeast spine in his main hand is going to
be absolute drek... because he says his piercing skill is
almost nonexistant.  In the long run, training up that skill to
use that weapon is going to make this the best strategy, but
if he wants to actually hurt stuff right now, he's better off
with slashers, even though the one he has is vastly inferior to
his piercer.  Thus I suggested LS when needed, and spine
when he has the luxury of not having to do his best.
