Learn to twist three songs!!!

There is no reason why any bard cannot do this.  I can twist up to
four most of the time.  I have come across so many bards that cannot
twist three songs.  A lot of people play bards thinking they are a
warrior with magic abilities.  So many bards fight with weapons and
keep only one song going.  Once you get to level 18 you can twist
denon's and chords of dissonance and do more damage than you can with
most weapons, unless you have something that procs for 100 points of
damage.  I've had other bards laugh at me for still using Chords of
Dissonance, a level 2 song.  What they don't realize is with an
instrument at level 22 (current level) I do 21 points of damage a
tick, which is 63 points of damage over 18 seconds.  Combine this with
20 points of damage a tick I do with denon's.  Over the course of a
minute a bard can do close to 370 points of damage over the course of
a minute, not including the damage you do from punching.  You can't
have this kind of damage output if you are dual wielding with two
weapons, unless these are uber weapons.  Since my punching skill is
high, I probably do close to 400 points of damage over the course of a
minute.  ALSO, these songs are area of effect so you do the same
damage to all creatures in the area.  All of this while on average I
heal myself 90hp with my hymn of restoration.  I haven't used a weapon
since Level 17.  The tough part is bringing up your brass skill.  All
you have to do find a seclusive area and play denon's for a few hours.
 I did this and I had my skill in brass up to 95 at level 18.

I've played several different characters and the bard has been the
most fun for me.
