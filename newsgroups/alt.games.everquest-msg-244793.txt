... The server side is where the objects are generated and maintained.
The client simply provides you objects with which you can access and
manipulate the objects in the world of norrath from your machine. But
they cannot, nor will they ever.. be the same objects. I'm sitting
here with a Blade of Carnage in my hand. I write down the stats and
data and the actions you can do with it.. swing, pick your nose,
whatever. I mail that to you via US mail. You write down swing as an
instruction and mail it back to me, i receive the message... i swing
it and do damage. Welcome to how Everquest works. The shit you have on
your side doesn't mean crap by itself nor will it ever because not
only am I a) holding your Blade of Carnage.. but b) i'm smacking an
object called the Avatar of War of class Mob with it because you told
me to. Any cached interface object that gets created on the client is
by definition existing outside of the game world, and by itself is not
an object in that world.. just an interface to it. As such.. you can't
hand it to someone else in the game world.. hit someone with it.. just
manipulate an object on the server with it.

The entire world that makes up Norrath for say the server Veeshan,
exists completely and utterly on the servers setup to host 'Fennin
Ro'.. which may be one server or a collection of computers,
processors, memory, and hard drives working together to serving up the
information to you. If they crashed tomorrow and wiped all their data
while you were logged, you'd be sitting crying how you lost all your
stuff.. including your BoC, because they cannot recreate the game
world from the clients.

Finally, the entire reason you NEVER, EVER put in-game objects and
player characters on the client goes back to the un-mitigated disaster
that hit Blizzard when they released Diablo and started battle.net.
The problem is.. with the player and item objects on the client.. the
user just hacked the memory and changed the data. I.e. this BoC has 15
DMG? NAHHHH... it has the highest damage value the variable can hold k
thx! You'd have people one-rounding AoW with a rusty dagger. People
ended up PK'ing on battle.net casting spells or swinging their weapon
and hitting for millions of hitpoints in damage.. boom, dead take your
stuff.

Yeah so? It went through the item database sure. Those aren't in-game
objects. The only thing on Lucy is a bunch of pictures and text...
don't confuse those with objects that can actually do stuff in game.
