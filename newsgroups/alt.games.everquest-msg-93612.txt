I know that this was posted earlier, but I missed the beginning of the post
and haven't gotten a reply to the original thread, so I thought that I would
try starting a new one.  Anyway, the post was about using Ortallius to
increase your clerics defense level.  My question is why this particular
NPC?  Is he weak?  or is there some other reason.  I'm very interested in
this, and my clerics defense basically sucks.  =)
