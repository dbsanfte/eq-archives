I agree 100%.  KEI is absolutely ruining the under 40 game... at least for
enchanters.  If my alt chanter joins one more group that has a resident
moron who runs off to the Nexus to get a KEI (WHEN I COULD GIVE HIM
CLARITY), I'm gonna scream.  If you think you *need* KEI when in a group,
you suck.  Plain and simple.

Also, we get idiots who think they can do anything because they have KEI.
"Oh, sorry, did I just overnuke and cause us all to die even though I'm
supposed to be the group's healer?" - Druid_1034.  Both of these scenarios
have happened to me multiple times.

It's bordering on an exploit that KEI works on low level folks to begin
with.  I really hope they fix (or fixed) it.
