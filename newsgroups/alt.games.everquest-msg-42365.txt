I always, always pick up stuff off the ground.  Normally this
is roots and berries, I call it cleric forage.  A couple of times
its been bags of goods, and sure enough the owner popped
in after a few seconds and asked about em.  Handed it right
over along with the suggestion that they should try asking
someone high level to do the transfer for them if they don't
have a friend handy.

The other day, though, my ground score was a blue diamond.
Noone claimed it, noone showed up wandering around in that
characteristic "where is that thing I dropped" way at the spot
where it dropped for over five minutes.

Here's the thing; stuff on the ground decays quickly, on the
order of two minutes.  So, if I hadn't picked it up, it would
soon have vanished anyway.  If this was an attempt at a
transfer, the guy doing it would have found nothing there
anyway, since he didn't show up in time.

Apparantly whoever it was didn't even miss it, or surely he
would have said something to the zone.

I gave it to a chanter in exchange for a couple Kpp worth
of twinky jewelry for my necro and went on with my life,
not a twinge of guilt.
