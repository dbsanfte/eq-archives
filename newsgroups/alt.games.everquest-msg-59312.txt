Aha, the amount of INT over 75 being the key factor, instead of a "plateau"
event at the 75 point, like you get with agility.

Unfortunately, I don't think I buy into this rumor.  For wis, at any rate, I
really don't see any difference naked (100 wis) or dressed (200 wis),
and that should be a 20% reduction in fizzle.  Oh, and my INT naked
is under 75... 60 to be precise, and no difference between that and my
dressed int of about 85.

Course I'm not an int caster, I suppose they could have put that
reduction in just for them...
