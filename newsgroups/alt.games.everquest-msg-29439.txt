Unfortunately, no matter how many times you say that "hacker means something
else," no one will listen.  You can blame anyone you'd like but hacker =
bad.

Sounds sorta like the die-hard Mac fans.  Sorry, but no matter how much they
bitch and moan, they DO NOT have a viable HOME computer.  Sure, it's cute.
Sure, it may (or may not) run faster than a Wintel.  Sure, it may (or may
not) be more stable than a Wintel (my only experience was the one at Kinkos
that kept crashing)...but it doesn't play the games that most HOME users
want.

ANYway, back on topic, you can keep typing 'til your fingers bleed, but even
those of us who know what the original meaning WAS often think "asshole"
when someone says "hacker."
