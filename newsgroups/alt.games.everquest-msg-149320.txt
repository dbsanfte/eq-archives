Nit:  Brellium can be (theoreticly) worn by four.  But since I've
never seen any of it non-imbued, and Half-Elves cannot worship
Brell, you may never see all members of all four races wearing it.

Old, Stale Bitch Reprise:  I don't give a damn if VI decides to allow
Half-Elves to wear every stinking variety of Cultural gear in the game,
I'll never forgive the bastards for blindsiding us with "no Cultural
Smithing for Half-Elves" <after> I'd spent all those damned hours and
pp getting my now useless smithing skill up into the 170s.
