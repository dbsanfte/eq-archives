I've experienced a few of the new voices.  The worst by far are the skeles 
in Vermin Snye that now sound like Bugs Bunny.

Also, what's the deal with all new tents and overland miners, woodcutters 
etc.?  Looks like we're being invaded.

And, there seems to be a lot more gathering nodes in Antonica.  Maybe they 
bumped it up figuring everyone would be fighting for food components?
