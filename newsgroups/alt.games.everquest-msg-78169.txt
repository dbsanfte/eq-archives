Correct.

Not quite correct.  How many bone chips you'll need depends
on your race/class/religion.  My Dwarf Paladin, for example,
required over 7,900 bone chips.

They're easy to avoid if you don't want to bother with them.
Plus you can kill two birds with one stone by using the outcast
iksars to raise both this faction and the LegionOfCabilis
faction standing you mention in #1.
