welp, i turned on EQ with all the settings on - ALL of them - and all on
maximum ... and wow, what a beautiful game!!!

my old box:
pIII 733 mhz
512 sdram
geforce 3

new box:
dual core 2.2ghz
2gb ddr 500
radeon 1900xt


and so, being the addict i am with 4 accounts, i have to ask: HOW do i
multibox?

-i got windows application compatability toolkit and fixed eq ... but i
wasn't able to alt-tab ...
-i can run eq in windowed mode at my screen's resolution, then minimize it
and start the patcher again to load another instane ... when i did that, i
couldn't use the mouse in the 2nd instance

...i think i'd be happy just having mouse and alt-tab, and if i can run 3 or
4 accounts at once, i'd be alright turning off all the settings (after 5
years, ya get used to it ...)

so is there a walkthrough for this? is this against sony's policy? am i
allowed to ask people in-game about all this? and what else do i need to
know?


thank you again!
