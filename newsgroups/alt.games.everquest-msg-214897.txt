Ummmmmm, if you notice, i *said* until LDoN i did the paludal 
route...but *now* i plan on doing LDoN groupings from 20 on for xp, 
though i think LDoN isnt for alts, but for noobs too...

as a matter of fact, you will get to meet more new prospective friends 
doing LDoN than anwhere else...and it will be great raid training. You 
will get a few noobs infiltrating groups of twinked alts, and I dont 
know about you, but i am more than willing to sit and give playing 
advice to noobs if it helps the group survive better...and learning your 
job in a 6 person group is the basis for doing your job in a raid.

aru
yup, i just started a baby cleric, twinked her with leftovrs fom my main 
and am specifically in paludal until 20, then moving her to LDoN groups, 
and quests...i *adore* doing quests=) they are what attracted me to EQ 
in the first place, and the fact that you make your own adventure rather 
than some gme designer in california [i havent played any of my old 
computer RPGs since i started EQ...]

My twink Suzique? i gave her a jade mace and crested mistmore shield 
laying around in the bank, my teachers syllabus and dont have anything 
in charm yet=) and her armor is my leftover Sol Ro temple quest stuff - 
vambs, greaves, boots - nothing too fancy...a turtleshell helm, 
blackened thinmetal visage, a shissar scale cloak, crystalline belt, 
barbed ringmail gloves and runed mithril bracers out of various 
replacements to better gear that i had on my trade mule, and a sapphire 
velium necklace from my tradecraft supplies=) her best item is my spare 
emerald dragonscale tunic...quested for and kept in the bank for some 
alt or another. By the time you are 50+ and equipment upgraded several 
times, you tend to have stuff in the bank. But then again, most of the 
time when i am playing on alts, i dont do the cleric gets first 
gem/first 3 gems...and in general i rarely roll for dropped loot. i 
pretty much take a share of the plat that drops. I dont need the loot=) 
and it makes the people who group with my alts happy=) I make my money 
selling tradeskill stuff in bazaar=)
