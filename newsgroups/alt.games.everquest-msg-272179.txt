In my game, this would depend on who sees him killing the Unicorn...and if
they survive to tattle on him.  Let me elaborate, but I'll use EQ1 examples
since those are mostly likely to make sense to everybody.

Say you are a Dark Elf, and you head over to Crushbone.  Dark Elves in EQ1
start out OK with the Crushbone Orcs.

In my system, if you were to kill an isolated Crushbone Orc, with no other
Orcs nearby, then you would take no faction hit.  If, however, there were
other Orcs nearby, who could have witnessed the slaying, they would be
marked as witnesses, and you'd have a certain amount of time to kill them
(probably one game day).  If you do not kill all the witnesses by then, the
assumption is they have managed to find other Orcs and pass on the tale of
your deed, and you take the faction hit.

Similarly for faction gain.  If you want to get a faction gain with the Wood
Elves for killing Crushbone Orcs, the Wood Elves need to become aware of
your acts.  This could happen by being witnessed by NPCs who are on
the Wood Elf faction, by being witnessed by players who have good Wood Elf
faction, or by turning in proof of your kill.  I'd have a "take trophy"
command you can do on the corpses of enemies you have defeated, which
represents cutting off a head or hand or genitals or something.

I'd also have racial factions depend somewhat on player behavior.  If one
Dark Elf goes and kills Crushbone Orcs and loses faction with them, that's
fine.  It would not affect Dark Elves in general.  But I'd have the game
keep track of how many Dark Elves have taken Crushbone faction hits over the
last couple of weeks, and how many Dark Elves the Orcs have seen that were
not engaged in killing Orcs.  If the first number starts getting significant
compared to the second, the base faction of Dark Elves with Crushbone Orcs
would go down.
