 From what I've read so far, this is probably more to do with the fact 
that Newbie Island lasts for quite so many levels...this surprised me to 
be honest, after my experience with EverQuest and it's 'chuck you in at 
the deep end' approach where you're given the whole of Norrath (sort of) 
and expected to go find the quests yourself.

Well from an EQ player's perspective, this is very reassuring...I like 
the scrolling chat window format

EQ2 sounds a lot to me like it's on a par with City of Heroes, levelling 
wise. EQ1 was quite slow at the levelling but it did incorporate a lot 
of skill increases into this levelling (Miglok levelled quite 
intensively and it took him a while just to ding level 6), whereas CoH 
is fairly fast paced levelling until you reach the double figures (The 
Shadow Ranger roared from 1 to 9 in the space of a few days and then 
slowed down dramatically).

LOL Yeah totally newbie thing to say, but I can understand where you're 
coming from :-) It used to be that games with these many controls threw 
me for a loop but experience fixes that quite easily, and from the 
manual I see the buttons are pretty standard. I'll no doubt be 
re-mapping most of them when I get in-game to reflect my usual MMORPG setup.

Considering it's web hosting I don't consider this to be a rip off 
whatsoever. The level of hosting they're talking about, a few pages 
which are kept dynamically up to date and involve some level of database 
access would cost a bit more than .99c if you went to other hosting 
companies. As for screenshots, you can take screenshots, the .99c is 
just for hosting them, and to be honest this is even less of a rip off 
as the amount of space my own site devotes to hosting EQ1 and CoH 
screenshots is a fair whack.
