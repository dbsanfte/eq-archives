I'm sorry.  I'm someone who takes things in context.

You were telling people to think for themselves in the context of whether it 
was okay to drink eyedrops with warning labels against doing so on them and 
a history of inducing comas and other brain and body damaging effects when 
taken orally.  You were suggesting that following warning labels somehow 
made a person a pawn with no initative or the ability to think for himself.

Apparently, you felt so strongly about this that you actually went ahead and 
slurped down some Visine just to prove your point.

So let me get this straight, you actually ingested a substance with a 
warning label warning of, among other things, coma, seizures, lowering body 
temperatures to danger levels and halted respiration, out of spite for 
someone with whom you were having a discussion on usenet.

You are the biggest fucking idiot in the world.

And you'll forgive me if your dosage argument doesn't mean a whole lot to 
me.  I suspect ingesting a drop of Drano wouldn't kill me, but I'm not going 
to run into the kitchen and measure it out just to make sure.  If that makes 
me a slave to the demands of the makers of Drano, I'll somehow be able to 
live with that.
