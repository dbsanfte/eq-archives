Having never visited Hate I could well be wrong here but didn't Hate and
Fear get ramped up for the 50+ crowd before SoV? Has it now been ramped up
for the 60+ Crowd?
Guess I should have gone earlier /sigh

Taken away some of the fun of finding your way around to start with but also
removed loads of frustration when you passed that same armoury store a dozen
times and still haven't found anything to kill.

I wonder if this was done because of the speed you level now? You don't need
to put a point into a weapon skill start it, it's train with use but it
takes all of 4 kills or something to clear 1st level be fore you know it,
you're 5th level with a skill of 7 in 1hs.
Will casters now get 5 points in their primary casting skill? Although it'd
be better if they got 5 points in their least used casting skill as there
always seems to be one that gets left behind then suddenly you get a really
good spell that uses a skill you have next to no points in it because
previously it would only be used for Endure Cold.

Well I once "heard" a person claim that the right hand number was his
FPS..(OMG I am getting 1500fps!)...Still he was the same person that argued
corpses not only caused network lag they also stopped new mobs from
spawning.

Damn, that was a bug? I thought that was intentional along with all the
other "improvements" to make the game more playable.  That just made the
Spire Spirits in ML more dangerous.

This has been like this for sometime...It also needn't be group restricted
anymore as the faction system was changed in respect to forms that were not
playable races.
