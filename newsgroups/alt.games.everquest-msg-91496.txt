Yes, it's only mana... but if you're in a group, your mana is your life. If
you're sitting in GFay doing nothing terribly important why not spare some
mana for free? It's not like you have any special plans for that bit of
mana. :b

I personally -hate- when Clerics rez outsiders while grouped, especially if
they make money off it. There's a time and place for making money. Any
Cleric that does rez while grouped should split the money made with the
group members. -Sorry, but that's just my personal annoyance. (Heh, I'm
'gonna be flamed for that.)

Being the odd person that I am, I refuse to pay people that ask for
payment... I pay those that don't anything, or are at least very polite.
(It's hard being a stubborn jerk sometimes...)

In other words, EQ isn't a job. Kill, have fun, kill, meet people... and
kill. Take the current circumstances into consideration and react to how the
person treats you. Note that I am admittedly an odd person, but perhaps my
thoughts will help you out a bit. :b
