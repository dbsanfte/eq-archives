There is at least one quest in the game that requires you hand in
two Lore items.  Since you can only have one Lore item in your
inventory at a time, you must either hand in one, then go out and
find the mob to kill to get another and return to hand the second
one in, or you need a partner to loot a second one, at which
point you come back and each hand in one.

I can't think of a clearer endorsement of MQ than that.
