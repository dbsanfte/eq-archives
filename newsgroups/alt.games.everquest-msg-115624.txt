Ok, getting to isle 7 actually takes some work, so most pharmers aren't
going to do it, plus, if anyone is planning on moving up, it's going to take
at least 8 hours to do it (the 'right' way at least), and it's going to take
a raid force to get up there.

As opposed to the reavers, which I can get up to in about 8 minutes alone
(get to the door in the reaver house at the back end of the ground level).

Anyways, the pharmers in question came in and killed the reavers with nearly
no time until respawn (since they had to clear the way to the next reaver),
they were there for at least 12 hours, and then were back the next day
again, the days in question being friday night/saturday morning and saturday
night, I happened to talk to one of them for a bit, apparently this is a
regular event for this little trio of braintrusts.  When I mentioned that a
friend of mine was going to do a reaver raid had they not been there, they
offered to sell my friend a reaver for 15k (fortunately I hadn't actually
disclosed any names).  Oh, and for some completely meaningless server
politics, they were /anon members of Infamous (/guildstatus makes idiots out
of many people who think that /anon means they're essentially guildless)

Once again, they WERE monopolizing reavers.  (unless someone wanted to go up
and kill Rak'Ashiir and then wait for that reaver to respawn)
