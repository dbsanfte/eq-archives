Well, ending a sentence (period) or a sentence fragment (comma).

And yeah, now-a-days dealing with computers and illiterates in general, it
pains me that in order to be understood when I say "You log in by typing
'hello.'," I MUST put the period outside the quotes or else they'll type it,
too.

Typing URLs in Outlook Express creates hyperlinks automatically. I'm pretty
sure that this one, www.microsoft.com, won't work for everyone (although it
appears it'll probably work for me) because of the comma.
