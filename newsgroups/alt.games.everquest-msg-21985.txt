Plus the new befallen is pretty dangerous. I went down there with a 35
druid, 35 paladin, 32 monk and me, a 36 mage. We got creamed because of the
enormous amount of mobs aggroing each other. The first floors went easy,
still a lot of aggroing skellies and never a single spawn that came. But as
soon as you get down a wee bit more you get creamed simply because of
numbers.

Not a nice zone to explore as a lowbie.
