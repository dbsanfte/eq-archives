Fact: Punch Card voting systems have been in place throughout the US
for more than 30 years.

Fact: No attention was paid to the pros and cons of the punch card
ballot systems until November 2000. For 30+ years Repubs, Dems and
Others have been happily voted into office with these systems and no
one has challenged the results or attempted to ban these systems until
after Nov2000.

Fact: Most problems associated with the punch card voting systems are
voter related and NOT process or equipment related.

Fact: Nov2000 was an unforseen event where the difference between the
two candidates fell close to the *acceptable* margin of error for a
punch card voting system. NOTE "Acceptable Margin of Error". This
standard was set and approved by the fed and state governments.

Is that enough "proof" yet?

The "proof" you demand was in my first post. You need look no further
than the fact that these systems were certified and in use for 30
years to see that whay I stated is correct. It makes no difference
which party anyone belongs too. They all were treated equally for 30+
years.
