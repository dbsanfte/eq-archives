All EverQuest servers will be coming down at 4:00 AM PDT (-7 UTC) on 
Tuesday 6/13/2006 for an update. Estimated downtime is 8 hours.

If I'm doing the math right, then downtime started at 7am EDT, which 
means they expect to be down till 3pm EDT, and will probably actually be 
up by 5pm, for about 10 minutes till they figure out that will-o-wisps 
are dropping JBoots, then repatch for the next four or five days.

Thats expected, no biggie.

But what I can't find is the traditional "patch notes" with which to 
occupy myself while weathering the patch process.  Nothing came up when 
I tried to log in, except a message (greatly appreciated) telling me 
that the login server was closed, "probably" because of a patch.*

Went to the EQlive site, and while it does in fact inform me that all 
the servers are down (except the Mac one), it doesn't say what the patch 
contents are.  The "upcomming updates" talks at length about things 
being done on Test.  The "recent updates" shows the April 19 one.

What about the TODAY one, thats neither upcomming nor recent?

And of course traffic here on AGE is so low these days that the most 
reliable source of all, someone racing to post the patch message here as 
fast as possible, also hasn't materialized!

*(Ok, not appreciated.  Take the time, guys, to actually change that 
message when there IS a patch in progress, and change it back when the 
patch is OVER, don't leave a generic "probably" message up forever, its 
just as meaningless as not having a message there at all.)
