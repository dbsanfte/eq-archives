Mana pool ? Mana regen ? at level 1 ?
sheesh... go grab what ever high hitpoint mana gear you can find cheap.
An mp1 item is nice just to be able to cast a few more times.
When you are starting you can easily fizzle away your entire mana bar.
It is better to have as much mana as you can.
Regening it back for the first 10 levels takes hardly any time.

For starting stats. no one can go wrong maxing out sta then either wis int
or str.
For fighting park your pet, pull to it, you tank and let you pet act like a
rogue hitting from behind.
Work on defense skills. If you are getting low on health back off let your
pet finish it.
Don't get below 20 30 percent health or Mob will stick to you like glue
The newbie quests all give nice starting gear so spend your plat on
jewellery.
Look for some azure sleeves , polished bone earring , gold fire wedding ring
, wolf fur slippers , earring of magikot if they are very cheap

And by level 20 check out website listed prior.
