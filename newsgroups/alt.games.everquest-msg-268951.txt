Uh... the *point* of playing EQ2 is to take your low level character and 
progress through the game, advancing him as you go. That is what the 
entire game is built around.

If you really *don't* enjoy adventuring, exploring, and gradually 
advancing your character in the process, *don't* play.

Or perhaps promote the idea that they release a special rules server 
where mobs/quests don't give XP, death doesn't cost XP, and new 
characters start at 70th level with GoD+OoW gear and a buttload of 
AAs... how does that sound? Get rid of the whole leveling/gear 
progression treadmill once and for all... should suit you perfectly 
since you seem to want to skip past it anyway.

OTOH if you are complaining that you do like the treadmill, and even 
enjoyed it the first time through, but just don't want to do it again... 
ok... don't. No problem there either.

EQ2 doesn't prevent you from having a bot in your group.
