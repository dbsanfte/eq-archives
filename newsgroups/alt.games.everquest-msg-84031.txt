It compares well to snare spells available to others, just be careful
you dont snare yourself. That really sucks.

I think you have to get some AA points for critical spell hits, so
this won't happen before lvl 51.

Translocate is nice, because the wizard can just send people off,
without leaving himself. If you are deep in some dangerous zone, and a
tank needs to go to bed, you can just tloc them out, and not have to
worry about getting yourself back to the raiding party. Especially
nice when on a plane raid.

Very understandable. When I get burnt on playing the wiz, I load up my
chanter, or SK for a little more variety in play. Wizard is much like
the other 2 archetypal classes, the warrior and cleric. These 3 are
the ultimate specialists in their area, and therefore do not get much
variety. They trade variety for maximum power in their specialty.

Definetly play whatever class you enjoy, but please don't turn away
the wiz looking for a group just cause you find their class boring to
play.
