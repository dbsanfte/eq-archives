Leo,

"you get sick of telling people over and over and over."

However, they are different people.  In most cases than none, the people
that may show up a month from now did not see those replies sent to the
pervious people.

In essence bro, everyone is different.  I for one was not (and I had just
looked through my little @home welcome box, manual, package) informed there
is a specific place to post test messages.  In fast as far as it goes is
telling me what my news server is.  While, I agree they (ISP's) -should-
tell people so that they aren't walking blind, mine for one and I can tell
you, did not. <grin>
