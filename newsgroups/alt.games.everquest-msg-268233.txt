I just started playing with crafting last night and managed to make
App III versions of a couple of my low-level priest spells. The recipes
were in "artisan essentials vol 5" IIRC (you can r-click on the recipe
book before buying it to see which recipes it contains).

The process was rather tedious with a lot of subcombines, but the
components were all things I had foraged or could buy from the 
wholesaler. I did have to resort to a web search to discover that
"isonoid reagent" fills the "refined isonoid" slot and that 
"elm lumber" fills the "refined elm" slot.
