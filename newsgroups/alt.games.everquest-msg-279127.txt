Level 69.

Plenty to do there before that, but for *progression* you are highly limited
until 69.  You have to have someone level 69 to start any of the raid events
I believe.

Doing faction and earning points can be done long before 69, and can
definitely be considered a form of personal progression, but not what you
were asking I don't think.
