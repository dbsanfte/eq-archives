Our guild has various events that have been of the silly variety.

Thre was the Gnaked Gnome Gfootrace. Everyone entering made a gnome lvl1
and did their handin for the guild note. Then they congregated at the PoD
and handed in their books to go PvP. Equip up with starting kit and then
it was a race from the waterfall in Ak'Anon to the Pool in Qeynos North.
Soulbinder use was permitted, no guild or non guild alt aid was permitted, 
fighting was permitted between gnomes, no spires, ports or Pok books
for any reason....

Winner did it in about 90 minutes IIRC. About 10 runners...
