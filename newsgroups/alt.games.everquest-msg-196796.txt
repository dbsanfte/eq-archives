My other half used to play a bard.  He was one of the better bards on
our server, having been mentored by a bard who was generally
considered to be THE best on the server, or at least tied for that
position. :)

He could twist 5 songs with consistency without dropping an effect. 
It was difficult, but he could do it, and was doing it the first time
his guild hit Vex Thal.

This was before people learned about the DA run to blob 1, so anyone
clearing to Aten Ha Ra was looking at 13 hours of raiding.  He twisted
4 or 5 songs at every fight.

He doesn't play a bard anymore.  He started to have arthritic pains in
his hands from all the button pushing over the years, and the long
raids that came with the advent of Luclin, and since then PoP, killed
his hands.

He's a necro now, and much happier. Just one more reason I'll never
play a bard...:)
