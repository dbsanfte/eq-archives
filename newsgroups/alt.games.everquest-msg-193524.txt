Yes, I know, responding again.   Bad me.

/shrug

Honestly, when I wrote the one pointing out how broad a statement he had
made, the response that I was expecting was for him to narrow it down to the
specific subset of games that, while they have a single player option, the
overwhelming majority of the focus is on the multiplayer action.  Notably
the later Quake games, Unreal Tournament.   Possibly Starcraft and Warcraft.
(I still very much have issues with claiming these two belong in that
catagory.  The single player missions in Starcraft (Haven't played WC3)
appeared to me to have had an obvious amount of effort go into designing
them.  Diablo 2 possibly?)

I had already half planned out my response, but it seems that was just
wasted effort.
