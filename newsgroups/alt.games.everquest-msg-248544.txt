A group of us were in Howling Stones last night and were using Levitation to
get to the East wing (to bypass the trap).  We all had Spirit of Bih'Li on
(had just zoned in) and levitiation.

All the other group members were able to levitate over.  When I tried, I
always floated down too fast to make it across.  Any ideas why I would
levitate lower than the others?

I am a barbarian shaman, but we had a barbarian beastlord who made it, so I
don't think it was race size.  Also, I only had about 70 of 250 weight, so I
wasn't overweight.

What other factors determine how high you levitate?

Any help is greatly appreciated.
