Quake damage in Salinas shuts part of juvenile hall
By David L. Beck
Mercury News

Earthquake damage that is believed to be recent has forced the =
abandonment, at least temporarily, of a large part of Monterey County's =
juvenile hall, and left authorities trying to rent space from Santa =
Clara or other counties.

Duane Tanner, the chief probation officer, said Friday that as many as =
30 young high-risk offenders -- about a third of the juvenile population =
-- need to be moved to high-security facilities in other counties. =
``I've lost all my individual rooms'' for potentially dangerous =
offenders, he said. Eight of them are juveniles being tried as adults =
for major crimes.

Thirty others will go to the county's low-security juvenile center, =
about two miles away, and the rest will stay in a new and relatively =
undamaged dormitory at juvenile hall on Natividad Road in Salinas.

A gymnasium, also relatively new, will absorb the classroom, health =
services and booking functions that were in the long, concrete building =
being abandoned.

The moves are temporary, pending the result of a thorough structural =
study that Tanner said would take at least 10 weeks.

The facility was criticized in a grand jury report last year. It's =
``about 60 years old, and has been declining for quite a while,'' said =
Tanner. In preparing a response to the grand jury, he and his inspectors =
found ``some fairly massive damage to the structure.

``You can really tell,'' he said. ``A 60-year-old facility is going to =
have a lot of cracks and problems, but you can clearly tell where a lot =
of the damage is brand-new.'' He mentioned a magnitude 4.0 earthquake in =
January that was felt as a sharp jolt in Salinas, though it was not =
believed to have caused any major damage.

A preliminary report from a county structural engineer found the damage =
``worse than we thought,'' he said. The building was believed to have =
been made of reinforced concrete, but it ``turns out we can't find much =
reinforcement in it at all.''

The damage appears to include cracked structural columns, as well as =
movement in the massive concrete slabs they support which, instead of =
abutting each other tightly, are six to eight inches apart, he said.

The damaged building was being closed down Friday night.
