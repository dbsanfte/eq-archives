There is a Thurgadin gate potion that is made using pottery.  Look up the 
shawl quests on www.eqtraders.com, I believe it's shawl 4 that has the 
part about the gate potion.  Alternatively, if you are not KOS in The 
Overthere, then you can get a hammer that procs a gate to The Overthere, 
which is what an Ogre BL friend of mine uses.
