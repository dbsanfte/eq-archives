And then a day or 2 later, after the many many many long hours of clearing
PoG (an 8hour+ job where we have absolutely zero need for the armour/loot on
any mob but tunare).. a lot of people suddenly went LD.

They log back in... to discover tunare poofed, AGAIN.

Twice now this has happened to us... even the most rational and calm of my
guildies were effing and blinding at this utter bs run of bad luck
