What is the goal of terrorism? To cause terror and by so doing disrupt the
normal way of life of its target. You are clearly a victim of this, in the
same way that all those willing to support things like national id cards and
the Ashcroft terrorism bill before Congress right now are. Decades of
fighting to preserve the rights of the individual in our society are going
up in smoke. They don't need to launch a biological attack; the damage has
already been done. In the name of protecting our way of life we are
destroying it bit by bit.
