no

for

into

me;
> ancient secrets, chants and charms of great power, tidings of the buried

beg

Fly
> buzzed. "Do you know who you are, and who I am?"
>
>       I laughed again. "I am nothing," I said. "I am the least of your

and

> sacred power within me, and for that I shall praise your name forever."

>       And then the Dragon laughed, for I had passed its Test. The fly was

sprang

>
>       I left my tribe an Irikhan, low of status, and returned a Khanarch'

that
