Here's another way to see this, that might be clearer.  Suppose you have the
XP split set to something less than 100% and more than 0%, and go out and XP
until you reach the next reward (AA point, level, or even part of a level
(such as reaching the point where a death doesn't unding you)).

If instead you had went 100% toward the reward, then 100% the other way, for
the same total amount of XP, you'd have achieved the reward earlier, and
still reached the same total at the same time (or earlier, if the reward was
something that you could use to speed up earning XP).

It works this way because the reward for XP is all-or-nothing.  In a game
where there were fractional benefits from different kinds of XP (say, a
level 59.9 had more HP and higher skill caps than a 59.3, and AA points
could be spent fractionally), then splits would quite possibly be optimal.
