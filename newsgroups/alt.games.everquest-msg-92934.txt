   Yes, I've taught lenny well. EQ, that is, not
grammar skills.  And he's right about the Wiz/Mage
combo being lots of fun.  I cast an earth pet, 
which roots the prey (or pray, if you rather) so
that it doesn't go after him when he nukes.  The
pet does some damage, of course, but mainly he's
there to keep the stuff off of us.
   And when both of us cast at night, it tends
to look very pretty.  We were hunting on top of
a big hill in Ecomms near the Wcomms zone one
night.  I was pulling to the top of the hill, and
then we would both nuke.  The mountain top looked
like a damned volcano going off.
