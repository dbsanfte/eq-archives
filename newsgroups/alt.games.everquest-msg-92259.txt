I went to luclin and the scarlet desert.  Entered through Twilight sea zone
and soloed right by the zone (and really only got in trouble a couple of
times when something spawned on top of me as I pulled to zone).  Can't quad
there, but GREAT exp I thought.  I also did some of 45 in EW (Rhinos STILL
blue at 49), and some at Karnor's Corner.  Took me about a week to get
through, but that was with intensive play on weekends on both sides.  I
really just learned to quit looking at my exp bar =)
