It really depends on the server you are on of course but 400pp is not
the going rate for the Drakkael Forged Bastard Sword.  They are a
common drop from the giants in GD and I would imagine EW and IC as
well.

On Morell Thule they commonly sell for 50 to 100pp.  Pretty scary how
bad the 2HS market has become.  You can attribute it mainly to the
Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword.  So many people were going into the
"new" RunnyEye and didnt want to hold onto them and were selling them
cheap.  For a while seeing them for 100p was not terribly unreal.  200
to 250 being more common for a while.  Forgive me, but a 2HS that is
24dmg 39dly  SvPoison, light weight and gives light is NOT a 200pp
weapon IMHO.  500 to 600 maybe but not 200.  

The result?  Prices on all of the decent 2HS like the 2H Practice
Sword and LoW  went thru the floor.
