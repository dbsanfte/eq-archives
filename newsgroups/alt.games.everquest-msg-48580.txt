I could not agree more. The ogre model is HORRIBLE looking very much
as you say like a large fat bald guy who just happens to have a fang
or basically a giant baby. This ogre is not scary or even funny like
the old model can be.. its just stupid looking and something to laugh
at. As you say the femme barb is passable but kind of overly large for
me.

The vahshir female looks good in the earlier screenshot

http://eq2.castersrealm.com/screenshots2/default.asp?Category=4

At casters realm where they also have a bunch, yet in these shots she
looks like AHNOLD! Her lags and arms are freaking huge, I could not
even tell it was a female really except seeing the earlier caster's
realm shot (on the later pages there) she has that same blue top.

The dark elf female is not that bad but like the female barbarian they
elongated her face and made it look overly masculine. In another shot
at casters realm you can see they copied the daoc female sitting
(almost exactly ;) )

I'm hoping you are right and that is the new female human model and
NOT the wood elf although judging from the dark elf they will screw my
woodelf too = / Like the human male model its really no better than
the old one though. And what is up with both her and a dark elf female
with almost yellow green hair in a couple of the caster realm shots?
Yuck...  

Look at the lil bald gnome from the casters realm shots, he basically
reminds me of the huge giant baby ogre shrunk down. Great.. I will now
have both a large and a small character that I keep having the feeling
I should try to burp. 

God, of all those models only the male vah shir is really ok at all.
I've gone from looking forward to new character models to being pretty
sure I'll have them turned off and view the old ones instead. I'm also
pretty sure now I won't be playing steroidy the female vah shir on the
russian swim team = /
