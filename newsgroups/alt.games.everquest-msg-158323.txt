I think its the raid xp thing. Raid groups can tackle mobs pretty
fast. The way it used to work was that a group got xp here, or another
one here.

VI probably thought people would not xp in the planes as much or, like
they were doing, go for AA points. It seems they are just rushing to
65 instead. I never got the need to rush to max level. 

I was on trib last night at like 2 am and saw 3 level 63's. To me that
seemed high. I had no idea people were above that.
