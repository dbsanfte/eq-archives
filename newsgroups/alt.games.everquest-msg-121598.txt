I would have to agree with what you have said.  The other night I pulled 
a shadow in twilight sea (was blue or light blue, not sure) and it 
lifetapped me for 150 6 times in a row (lucky mend was up) and then did 
it probably another 9 times when I finally got back to my healer.  
Basically its time to fight only non-casters.  Oh, and the chain-casting 
is great, now FD is almost impossible to get off against a caster.  
Can't wait to see what happens if I ever get 2 casters in a pull.

Ron.
