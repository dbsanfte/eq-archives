DSL is broadband.  Cable is broadband.  Sattelite is broadband.  Wireless is
broadband.  I'm sure there are some other innovative broadband solutions
that I missed.  Based on your email address I will assume that you mean
cable broadband is great.

As to which is better, a lot depends on the provider.  Some providers are
much better than others.
