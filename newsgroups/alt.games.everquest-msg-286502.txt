When you come back to it fresh, you'll find its a completely different
fight.  I remember beating it a couple years back with a (mostly)
elemental geared team, max level 70, etc etc, mostly the same as ya'll
it sounds like.  but RC is not a fight for the end of the night.  it
takes 110% of the team on point and alert, because even with a perfect
run, its 80+ minutes off mezzing tanking healing and rezzing.

but fear not AoE is a pushover compared to his council.  He's got a
few more HP, but otherwise.  meh.
