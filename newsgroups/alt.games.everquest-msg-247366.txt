I was actually inspired by playing fantasy baseball once upon a time.
I was frustrated that everyone could have the same players on their
teams, and that it was all stats-based -- no actual games were
happening. This was back in 2000 when I don't think there were any
systems that did simulated games. So I wrote my own! I am still
working to improve it as time goes on. :-)

Some time in the near future, I am planning on adding a free trial to
it (short season, essentially), if you're interested.
