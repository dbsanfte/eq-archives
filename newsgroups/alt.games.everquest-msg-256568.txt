I use my warrior stun kicks to interrupt just about every spell I can... but
that is only just because it's an option.   The only spells really worth
stressing over are complete heal and gate.   I used to stress over turgurs
(sp? - Shaman slow line) as well, when I was lower level, but it never lands
on me anymore.

The only real concern I would have for a bard doing it is that it's probably
going to mess up aggro.   Whereas singing resists would probably have the
same result (no damage spell landing on you) without the high aggro
component.
