Now, ignoring the stupidly simple option that Ben has given (and I must
admit I didn't think of it) I'll try again with my, more complicated,
method;

Get new copy of EQ, new account key
Create account using Brother's details but your billing info.
Brother now has 2 accounts in His name, with his details. If old account
payments expired then even better, take these back up with your billing
info.
Request transfer of character from 1st Account to New Account, only
difference between these is that the 1st had different payment details when
created but verant will just ask for an explaination on why, quote:-

"If the credit card holder is
different from the holder of the card on file, please enter a short
explanation in the bottom field"

All the other details of the account are identical, same name, address,
email etc so no problems.
Cancel first account and let brother do whatever the hell he likes with it,
new account info goes to Sister, account keys to sister, Brother has account
in name only.

The only problem is if Brother has sold account or is selling and not
willing to cooperate, in which case Verant's red tape is not the issue, her
pig headed brother is.
