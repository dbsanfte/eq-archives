Then what is the point of high skill, if, as you suggest, it has no effect

Without attacking, of course.  No stuns, no strikes, just walk up to what
someone is fighting and use your taunt key.

Not even close.  You can sit there and taunt all day, and it will *still*
not switch to you.   If it was adding hate every time, as you suggest,
sooner or later you would succeed.   The fact that you can have an absolute
failure level strongly suggests that it's all or nothing.

It can only disprove it if you accept your other assumptions, which my
experience suggests are baseless.
