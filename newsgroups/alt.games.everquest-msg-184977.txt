Hehe - I'm so glad that grin was in there.

My GF and I have been together for 14+ years,
with no intention of getting married.  All I
ever hear from folks when I say that is "when
you going to marry that girl?"  As though we
aren't married because I'm afraid of committing.
Suffice it to say, if my girlfriend wanted to
get married, and I wasn't willing to do so -
she would have a different boyfriend right now.
She is far to assertive to allow anyone to
walk over her.

OTOH, it does require a lot of extra work
to get some of the same rights as married
couples get without effort (Power of attourney
being high on the list.  Both of us want
our organs donated should we die - but her
sisters object to that in a MAJOR way.  The
only way to insure that happens without being
married is explicit legal documents.)
