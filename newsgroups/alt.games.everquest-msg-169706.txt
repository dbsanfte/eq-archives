potions DS.....hmm very nice idea)

but have you ever tried  to get some of that snare right click spyder webs
from CC, snare a mob and fear him? clerics have very good fear spells. thats
why i want a snare. with it we could do awesome XP....even on pop (e.g. pull
mob to near caves on pov in the corner with snare.....fear him, whack him.
if he runs too far into the zone root him till fear wears off  .....
repeat.....result: 6 to 8 percent AA per kill on the right mobs).

/sigh but when do u have the time to solo at all as a cleric? :p never!

but its still a nice dream )))
