I was October of 2001 when I first signed onto EQ.  It was frustrating
at first but awesome.  The world was so vast.  The challenges were
everywhere.  What were all of those things the vendors sold used for? 
How could anyone ever make it to level 50?  I played and played,
amazed at all of the wonderful vistas.  Walking through the Karanas
was a scary and intense experience.  Never knowing when a lion was
about to pounce on me.  I admit I immersed myself.  It was like having
a life where everything was possible and you could see the results of
your actions.  You gained experience, levels, equipment, loot...   I
explored and couldn't get enough.  It was like Tolkien's world, my D&D
experience and all the great Sci Fantasy books rolled up into a real
place I could live in.  I played every race and every class.  I did
quests, camped and tradeskilled.  I took my enchanter across the world
hawking jewelry.  I became a rich trader in the bazaar.  I spent weeks
gathering all of the materials to have a set of the best armor custom
made.  I spent wonderful evenings as a great Oak on Orc Hill saving
unknowing warriors.  I took breaks.  I bought a horse and rode proudly
around the newbie areas showing off.  I made a great friend and
together we worked our way up the Tower of Frozen Shadows.  I am now
back after a long break and see vast expanses still unexplored.

I personally believe this will go down in history as the first
'virtual world'.  I bet you could get people to 'fully immerse' if it
were feasible.

I know... get a life...  take a break... step away from the PC... 
But, it is great to be able to go to a place where life is full of
magic and danger.
