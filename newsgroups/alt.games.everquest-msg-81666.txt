All the other ports are to continents that are designed for character of 
all levels.  Velious was made for, and remains geared towards, characters 
level 35+.  It's not like someone is going to go to Velious to find that 
great newbie hunting ground.  (Snowbunny hunters don't count, they're 
strange and most likely suicidal.)

This is true, though if you fall victim to this more than one time, I'm 
gonna say it's nothing more than a bit of chlorine in the gene pool.  If 
you're trying to get to Odus (which has to be the LEAST used portal from 
Nexes), and you've never been in Nexes before, and you sit on the portal 
and go AFK, yeah, it might happen.  However, if you pay any attention at 
all, they nice people in the portal mention which portal is firing.  They 
give the 5, 3, 2, 1, now countdown for portal to Velious, then it fires.  
The wording is something like:

	The portal to Velious will be active in X minutes.

Shortly after it fires, they start the 5 minute countdown for the other 
spires, the wording is now something like this:

	The portals to Kunark, Odus, Faydwer, and Antonica will be active 
	in X minutes.

I think it's pretty clear that there is a difference.  At least clear 
enough that I'm gonna be a jerk and laugh at anyone who gets ported to the 
wrong place.  (I have hereby cursed myself to fall victim to this, and 
will most likely die.  I will post as soon as karma bites me in the ass.)
