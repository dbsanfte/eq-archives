I think these quest, as nice as it is to have Verant acknowledge their
players, all these quests, the WereWolves, the Undead in Karana, the Rathe
Mountains are all kinda well...silly.

I don't see how they relate to the story, yes we have had previous invasions
of the dead and such but this is ridiculous. They events go on and on, kill
the Werewolf Overlord, the quest just starts over, is this a specific slap
in the face for roleplayers or just trying to make it so unrealistic we
don't give a damn anymore?

No role-playing goes on in any zone of my server (Tunare), and well it gets
old, yes wow undead GraveYard Knighty/spec thingy spawned, whoa you took it
out. Any good loot? No not really, not as far as I have heard or seen.

Is it really that usefull to have these? Its exciting once in awhile but
when they go on for so long and its repeating itself kinda defeats the
purpose of even going to an event because isn't having an impact on the game
what we really want?

Whatever....
