ok heres my comp specs

P3 800mghz
768mb ram
Hercules 64mb GeForce2 video
Gamesurround MUSE XL sound
56k dialup
11 gigs free drive space
768 mimimum swap space, 1536 max


I hardly ever got lag before in EQ. I could go
into Warsliks Woods or Burning Woods without
lag or framerate drop like with my older computer.
Now, I have to turn everything down to mimimum in
order to be able to walk in the vah shir city and
its still VERY slow outside. I thought this system
I have would at least be able to handle the bare
minimum. Is it happening to everyone else? What
are the REAL system requirements to be able to see
all the new models, animations, max clipping (so
we can see when something is charging at us)
and decent textures? Is the game now going to
REQUIRE that people have DSL connections in order
to use any new features? Not everyone in the
country has access to DSL. I can understand
games like Quake and Unreal where its a fast
paced first person shooter but the reason I
play EQ is that it isnt totally bandwidth
dependent and thus allows a very large market
of customers who would otherwise be shut out
of the online gaming community because of the
 unavailability of high speed connections.
With the specs of my comp i assume my lag
problems are either due to a software bug,
improperly created zones (ive built quake2
maps so i know what its like to debug a video
lag problem with visibility) or my net connection.
I hope Verant doesnt follow along with other games
by utilizing so many textures, models and detailed
maps that only a system with very high bandwidth
capabilities would be able to function in it with
full capabilities. (as opposed to turning every
visual option off...whats the point in that? 
might as well play something else)
