FIVE QUESTIONS
Brad McQuaid 



McQuaid is one of the creators of EverQuest, a popular online,
role-playing game developed by a San Diego company that Sony later
bought. He left Sony last fall to start a company with Jeff Butler,
another EverQuest developer. The company, Sigil Games Online, is
dedicated to producing multiplayer, role-playing games online. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:  What do you think has been EverQuest's impact in the world of
computer gaming? 

A:  Well, it's proven that subscription-based, massively multiplayer
games can be very successful, and that the Internet and PC hardware is
mature and sophisticated enough to entertain over 90,000 people
simultaneously in a virtual, 3-D world.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:  Why did you leave Sony? 

A:  During my five years at Sony/Verant Interactive, I was a
programmer, a producer, and then a vice president in charge of five
different multiplayer games. I learned a lot about myself, including
that I'm happier working on a project more "hands-on." To that end,
Sigil Games will remain a relatively small company focused on, at
least initially, one title. This should give me the opportunity to
return to my roots, in a sense. That said, it was very hard for me to
do, and I still feel a lot of pride when I play and think about
EverQuest.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:  What kind of game do you envision making? 

A:  We are actively in talks with several of the larger games
publishers, working on a development deal. We're definitely committed
to creating another massively multiplayer online game, but the
specifics aren't finalized.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:  What is your favorite computer game to play these days? 

A:  I just finished playing through Return to Castle Wolfenstein and
had a lot of fun doing so. I'd thought I was pretty burned out on the
whole action, first-person shooter genre, but this game really brought
all the fun back. I also really enjoy real-time strategy games like
Age of Kings and Empire Earth. There's something about empire-building
that really appeals to me.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:  Where do you think online role-playing games will go from here? 

A:  As more and more people discover the Internet and subscribe to
broadband, the more the online game space will grow. And, as more
developers enter the arena, and as technology advances, online gaming
will rival the movie industry in terms of popularity and revenue in
the next 10 years or so. It's really an exciting time--we are
witnessing the birth of a potentially huge and culture-changing
entertainment medium, and I'm very excited to be able to be part of
it.
