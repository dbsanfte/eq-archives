I personally am quite fond of netherbian lair for after paludal, but that's 
partly because my main needs a few thousand more of a tinkering component 
that drops there :)  A lot of other people recommend echo caverns and marus 
seru.  Old school folks still go to the giant fort in frontier mountains.  
I would leave paludal at more like 24-25.  The exp doesn't seem as good 
when they're all low blues.

}> class.

Both the ones I know of appear to be dead at the moment.  I've never really 
needed either of them, though.  The forums at eq.crgaming.com aren't bad.

}> for some of your spells.

I believe 'page' is spelled out on the actual loot.  But I won't swear to 
it. :)  mythiran.allakhazam.com will tell you which pages you actually need 
in the very common event that you have someone else research your spells.  
Rumor has it some of those spells are also available from a merchant in 
katta castellum now, but I haven't been over there to check.
