Actually, there is no risk at all unless you are totally stupid or an icy
servant spawns when you don't expect it.  You can charm/cast on mobs, mobs
cannot leave the well.  The popular trick is to charm a neriad mistress,
have someone pull sirens into the well and then proceed to have the pet chew
them up.  If charm breaks, no biggie..you are sitting outside the well
underwater where the stuff can't path out.
There are at least 2 or 3 other places in the zone where you can round up a
bunch of seahorses, take them to a spot where the pathing 'stops', and AE
them while they just stand there.

What really surprises me is that VI has fixed marginally bad pathing in
other zones, but the pathing in SG is busted in a way which allows for
exploitation on a really big scale.  My guess is that since its such an
underutilized zone as it is (I only really ever see people hanging out at
the zonelines.... no one really ever seems to go in deeper), people are
largely unaware.
