Granted I don't hunt there enough to be hanging out in front much. In
fact, the only time I've "run" there was on a really stupid overpull
camping the sentient armor a while back. But I recall running into an

groupmate who had no CoV faction. Might have been a rare or pulled there
or somesuch, of course.
