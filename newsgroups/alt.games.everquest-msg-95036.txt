Well, I'm going to defer the whole thing until I can get hold of a copy 
of the magazine (someone must have it at my workplace) and triple-check, 
but I've never read the article online, (I've never even visited Lum the 
Mad's site), and I distinctly remember thinking "this is going to make 
waves" when I read that particular quote on the interview.

Until such time that I can refer back to the article, I can entertain the 
possibility of me being mistaken, but if I am, I'm going to start looking 
under the sofa for spent vials of crack, because I can think of no other 
explanation (unless, of course, there are different editions of that 
issue of EDGE, and yours is expurgated).
