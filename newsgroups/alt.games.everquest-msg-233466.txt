I've generally read that the way to go is run3, then level to 65 and,
whatever you do, keep your split either 100% regular xp or 100% AAXP.  That
was what I did.  Most of my friends did a percentage - generally either
90/10 or 80/20.  It's hard to say what the "right" way is.  I leveled faster
than they did, but when I got to 65, I felt a bit underpowered because all I
had was run3.  If I had to do it over again, maybe I would have stopped at
63 to at least get Spell Casting Mastery - maybe, but I'd probably still go
with the mantra that levels are greater than all.
