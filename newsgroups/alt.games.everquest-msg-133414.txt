No, not really, I do want the spell in my book, but it's not a spell I can't
live without for a while. It's not often that I acquire anything of much
value to sell, so to me I'd rather have the item I'm saving for than the
spell. I'm just keen to know its true duration. Carrying bat wings is no big
deal to me ..

Kind regards ..

Stevie.
