The person who wrote the trade skill code in EQ tells a different
story:

    Without revealing the details of the equations the
    relationship is as follows.

    The higher of either Int. or Wis. effects both the
    chances of success and the rate at which skill points
    are gained. The forthcoming various stat bonuses for
    various skills, such as the strength bonus for
    blacksmithing will provide a success bonus that will
    stack with the Int/Wis bonus.
