A tool can be used for many purposes.  However if you give someone a tool
more commonly used for one purpose, but mean for them to use it for another
without giving any hint as to what, you have no right to complain when they
think it was given to them for a purpose other than what your original
though was.  If you want them to use a tool for a purpose which is rarely,
if ever, discussed, then to be more like to ensure they at minimum do
understand your intended use, suggestions or hints would be helpful.

I was basing this on the activity of the thread, regardless of how many
participents were involved.  This was simply a point of refference from the
beginning up to the present.

As I said before, simply answering the question would have been more
appropriate.

I already did thank those who gave possible ideas (which were explained to a
point of understanding the general concept of the idea rather than simply
the mentioning of one of the tools to be used).
