This isn't what happens at all, because logs show more than 4 pets
hitting close together.

This was not some nerf of pet casters due to Luclin stuff - the 4 mobs
max on a target rule dates WAY before that.

Pets are no longer truly NPC's - In order to fix the Sword of Runes bug
(in the hands of a pet, the thing procced on anything, and frequently) 
they made pets less NPC like, and more PC like.

A while back (pre pet upgrades by a substantial ways) a list of questions
was fielded by the mage community and answered by Absor.  At this time
he confirmed the 4 pet rule - but considering the major blunder he made
in answering the pet XP question, and the logs of mages showing >4 pets
hitting close together - we have our doubts as to how correct he was on
this issue.
