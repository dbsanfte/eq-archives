Then create a new char and experience it. Simple as that.

Being a programmer myself, I think it's a safe assumption that they
will change most aspects of the code/databases DRASTICALLY, having
learned from past mistakes. This would pretty much prohibit porting
existing characters. The equipment, skills, even class and race would
be incompatible.

I agree with Justin. New game. Play it from scratch like everyone
else.
