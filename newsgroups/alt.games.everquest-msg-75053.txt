I keep the DD handy when soloing because sometimes I have to finish a mob
off and run.  I almost never use it either in group or solo, as I am far too
often the primary healer.  As for Can II, I use it a lot, I was not out to
complete the quest specifically until I found I had everything but the
greyish bones from KC.  At that point, I went into KC a few times, asked for
permission to loot the bones if someone dropped the skeletal warlord, and
got it after 3 or 4 tries.  Only time I use Glamour is for someone who is
mezzing, and doesn't have the same or better, or for when I am
buying/selling.  I have certainly changed my lineup over time as I get new
spells, and/or learn from others or from my own mistakes.
