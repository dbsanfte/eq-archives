Testing costs resources, and consumers have proven largely willing to
pay for untested products, essentially doing the testing for the
companies. Untill consumers can once again properly organize
massive-scale boycotts for improperly designed goods, corporations will
continue to provide untested defective products, occasionally giving
placating rewards to the odd complainer to give the appearance they
care. Sony has simply taken that bold step of not placating the odd
complainer. EQ may no loner pull in the numbers it once did, but it is
still likely proving a good cash-cow, given they're even bothering to
do much of anything with it in the first place. Put in these occasional
fun events, and if they don't work quite right extend the event for
another week. Enough EQ subscribers are willing to put up with the
bullcrap to not motivate Sony to fix anything. If enough subscribers
did finally put their money in mouth, Sony would probably be more
likely to just pull the plug on EQ and put out some other shiny object
on the market in its stead. We really are in a loseing stance with
them. As it is, we're happy if ANYTHING gets fixed, or really even
works on the fourth or fith patch attempt.

I'm not sure the Haloween event this year ever worked properly. I don't
have high hopes for this one, though I'll probably attempt it to see
what goodies I can get. The stats from the pumpkin bread were better
than the party cake I had. Maybe there'll be some party bauble that can
replace the festive doll.
