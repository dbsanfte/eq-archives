When I go to Katta, I go Nexus->SH->Echo->FG->TS->Katta.  It's the 
shortest run, and there is a port to courtyard stone in the wall 
underwater in Katta near the entrance form TS.  The zones you cross going 
that way are fairly small, so it doesn't take long.  FG can be a bit 
hairrasing at low levels though.
