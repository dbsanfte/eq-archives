Lake of ill omen by firiona vie area would be good. There is a
beastlord trainer in FV zone which you can train at by using sneak.

Warrens is kinda hairy, you have no where to train except  halas so
really you'd probably take the wizard spires to the nexus and train
around there if there is a beast lord trainer. One nice thing is the
wizzie spire is so near the paineel zone that its a short journey to
vendors who will buy and sell to you (once again, any who won't you
can just use sneak behind (great racial skill that ;) )  This area
probably would be kind nice for a beastlord, especially once you are
stonebrunt level.
