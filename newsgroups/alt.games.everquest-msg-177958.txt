Oops.  That'll make your heat transfer *worse*.  You just need the thinnest
possible layer - really, you just want to mate the CPU surface w/ the heat
sink surface w/o any air between.

Also - did you scrap the pink gummy stuff off the base of the heatsink
(assuming it came that way)?  If you have pink gummy stuff - which really
sucks and you should get rid of it anyway - plus thermal paste, you're heat
transfer is pretty minimal.

Me, I had nasty heat problems w/ an Athlon 850 - I solved 'em with this:
