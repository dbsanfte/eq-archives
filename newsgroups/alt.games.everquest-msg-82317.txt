Ohhhh... I wanted to say something again, but I'm gonna shut my mouth! Is 51
young? That's all I'll say.

Yes, I am new to the group, but I am not new to hating stupidity. Hmm, might
be my 2nd big bitch, not sure. Generally I try to be helpful, as I expect
others to be when I post a question (even when I'm being stupid about it,
and I'm the FIRST one to admit that I am or have been! :) ) But yes, I only
recently arrived... and I plan on sticking around :) Good NG! And I kinda
thought the same thing -- this person is a "drive-by"!

I agree that Biz and DT contribute positively to the NG. I've asked some
frankly (looking back on it) stupid questions, and they were both polite and
informative, and never said hey, you know, that's a stupid question!.

I think that this person, whoever he/she is, doesn't post often and only
reads the NG as a kind of 'broken compensation' for something else. He/she
certainly knows nothing about this NG... and he/she has the audacity to post
on something he/she knows nothing about! I just love those people who do
drive bys.

thanks,
Dark
