Incorrect.

There are TWO settings.  One is the /showspelleffects setting.  That just
disables spell particle effects.  The other one is in your Options/Display
settings.  I forget the name.  Special effects?  Something like that.  That
one disables ALL of the particle effect.

Turn the one in Options/Display ON, then do /showspelleffects off.

Then you'll be able to see all of the special particle effects, except for
the spells and bard songs.

It used to be that the one in the options screen was the only one.  People
would turn it off so that they wouldn't get bogged down displaying all the
spell effects.  This had the side effect of disabling the particle displays
on the epic weapons, smoke from torches and fires, the Thurgadin waterfall,
etc.  So they added the /showspelleffects toggle so that you would be able
to see the other stuff, but not the spells.
