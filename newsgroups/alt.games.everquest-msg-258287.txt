To be honest, they're being pretty nuts telling you not to nuke.   Thier
pushing problems are almost certainly a result of thier "buttload of
beastlords", and a few of them not realizing that thier warder procs can
have a knockback component.

And actually, didn't I see posted here that push from nuking a mob was based
on the direction that the caster was facing when the nuke was cast,
reguardless of the spatial relationship between actual mob position and the
caster?   If they haven't changed that, you could actually help stop the
pushing, by facing the correct direction while casting your nukes.

Really sounds to me like the equivalent of saying to warriors "Dammit, stop
hitting that mob!  You'll push it all over the place.   Go sit in the corner
until you're asked to tank something."

And are you willing to take responsibility for every pet user you raid with
doing the same?     Remember, one out of control pet is all it takes.
