Piercing is the third one handed skill, although admittedly its not 
named 1hp, even though a 2hp skill does exist for paladins (and... SK? 
Or is it the same skill for one or two hander piercers, and just 2hp 
-weapons- exist?)

I discounted the first two 1h skills as very easy to skill up.

I've seen many rangers who are quite happy with 2hb and 1hb weapons at 
one point or another in their carreers.  Funny thing you may not have 
noticed, the blunt weapons are less popular and thus tend to be priced 
much lower for comperable effect... whether "price" be plat, or "NBG" or 
"DKP" or even officer award (where officers ask who wants the item 
before saying who gets it)

Four hours for 120 points.  Imagine how fast 5 points would go by.  Not 
four hours, I'd guess.

For a few minutes, and only on the "easy" mobs; exactly how much 
suffering is that?  And I also explained that you can just as easily go 
solo the points up... which will also only take a few minutes, rather 
than the 4 hours you propose.

Also, as I demonstrated, we are talking one 1 hand weapon (these are 
easy to get in fast models) and one 2 hand weapon, almost certainly 2hb, 
which means a free weapon with a 22 delay; its going to go up just as 
fast as the 1 hander is.

Ten skill points per level.  Such a hardship, I can see why you'd work 
so hard to avoid it.

Splendid
