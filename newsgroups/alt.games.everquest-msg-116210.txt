Audited by whom?  I'm not going to say you're wrong, I'm just going by the
information I received from a good source.  I sure HOPE you're right,
because we aren't in compliance otherwise (though I'm working on it).   We
don't clone HDs though, I just use the same license number any time I have
to reinstall Office or Windows on a computer that I had to reformat.  It's a
hell of a lot easier than trying to track down the legit one on our older
computers (I can prove we've got the right to have MS products on each
computer using the packing slip, but finding media after 3 years gets tough
:p )
