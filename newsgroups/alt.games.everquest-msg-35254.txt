Haha! I knew it! Maybe they should have GM events where everyone has to drink a
ton of ale and then run naked through lavastorm, hehe.
Ive drunk to the point of not being able to walk straight (in EQ and real life)
but does it get any worse? If you drink more for example will your character:
Hug his mates while slurring 'I fuckin love youuu...' in their ears?
Do Troll/Ogre/Dwarven women start to look more attractive?
Automatically duel anyone in sight while shouting 'Come and ave a go if ya
think ya hard enough'
Eventually collapse in a pile of their own vomit while mumbling incoherently?

Seriously though, perhaps drinking should give your character similar stat
buffage as a courage spell.
