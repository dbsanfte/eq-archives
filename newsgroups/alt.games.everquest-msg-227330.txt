From looking at your profile, which in itself I found interesting as
everyone else I've ever seen uses magelo!, it looks like your jewelery
wouldn't harm from an upgrade!  From a chanters perspective I'm always
looking to hp these days rather than int which I seem to have in
abundance.  Shadel Bandit rings are chap & cheerful, Ring of
Thunderous Spirits a bit pricier (Id have to check on druid
wearability) & Valorium Ring of Galantry is nice too but thier prices
have gone mad too recently.

The hyper inflation on some servers has been caused by a few players
who make real world $ by selling plat & gear.  An exploit was found to
generate unlimited plat which resulted in the price of plat falling
enormously.  They then switched to buying up every high value item in
the bazaars, which some folks cashed in on increasing the price for
those items several fold.  Ornate Silk prices I watched go from 75k
for legs to 225k, arms from 50k to 150k & bracers are around the 250k
mark too.  I've been saving up to buy some bits but they are way out
of my price range now.  One trader I know (guildie of mine) who is
renown for overpricing stuff anyways had his entire stock priced over
80k bought up in one go, he reckons over 1m pp!!  Unfortunatley the
highest price item I had to sell was 3k & no one wanted that :(
