Something beyond "let's PvP because we don't have anything else to do
and I'm bored of the grind".

Even DAoC players don't think their game is PvP anymore. The expansion
was all PvE related. Keeps are meaningless. Only the relics have any
effect at all and that is fairly minimal; as well as being something
most the player base doesn't have any role in.

DAoC has been moving away from PvP for a long time. Mythic found it
too hard to balance with the way their combat system works. Another
victim of a company that doesn't really understand what its doing, it
just takes what others did and tries to meld it in.
