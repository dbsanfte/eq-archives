My only comment here is that while this is a reasonable view -- and often
the most effective way of looking at the problem of resource management
for a particular group -- it's a pretty healer-centric way of looking at
the world. And when your group consists of people who can't directly trade
their mana for someone's hitpoints, it tends to show the weakness of this
viewpoint.
  
In particular, I often find myself in small groups (1-3 people including
me) where hitpoint regen rather than mana regen is the limiting factor.
With our bard+ranger pair in Crystal Caverns, for example, the ranger
starting at FM couldn't chain heal fast enough to keep either of us alive,
so her mana usage was almost irrelevant: thinking of it as a mana regen
problem wasn't terribly useful. Two warriors duoing would also find it odd
I'm sure to describe their tactics in terms of mana regen, given that
neither of them has any mana!

My point here is that EQ has multiple resources to manage, and while most
groups may be able to trade one for another (clerics trade their mana for
the warrior's hp), and some classes have more direct trades (lich and
cannibalize lines), treating it all as "just" a mana regen problem is a
not always useful oversimplification.

This is, of course, all from a bard's point of view. I tend to think of
mana regen as just another facet of downtime management rather than its
focus.
