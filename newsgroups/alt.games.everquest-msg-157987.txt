Just a few quick questions about the Note for Rebby rat whiskers quest
in Freeport:

How many rat whiskers does a KOS player have to turn in to be un-KOS
to FP Militia?  And I know people often will make a mule to do the
actual giving the note to Rebby and then transfer the whiskers to
their KOS character; does the KOS character still need a wolf form to
give the whiskers to the Dark Elf in the EFP tunnels?

Thanks in advance,
