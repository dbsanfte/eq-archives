Because the "soft cap" for merchant prices is 110 charisma (my memory may be
faulty, it's around there).  Anything over that has no effect.  You WILL
notice a difference if you compare a CHA of 60 to one of 100.

EQ uses soft caps in a whole lot of places.  A "hard cap" is when a stat just
doesn't go higher.  "Soft cap" means that the stat goes up, but has no more
(or in some cases very little more) effect.  Note that the soft cap for
different uses of a stat can be different.  For instance, CHA stops helping
merchant prices at 110, but keeps helping some types of enchanter spells much
higher than that.
