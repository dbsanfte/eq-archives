Of course it doesn't. I was merely illustrating the fact that they do 
not release software with *no* testing. Maybe it's just splitting hairs, 
but you are claiming exactly that over and over here.

I completely agree that the level of testing they *do* perform leaves 
much to be desired, but let's not get ridiculous with our claims in 
complaint.

Again, you're making wild assumptions.

I haven't seen a rash of people crashing due to AA bugs, and that's what 
we're talking about here.

You can't possibly know that, yet you continue to debate as if you do. 
Like I've said, I'm no SoE apologist. I will complain about their poor 
practices as much as the next guy. What I *won't* do, however, is 
blatantly stretch the known truth to bolster my views.

What we've seen is most definitely proof of poor testing. Jumping to the 
conclusion that it proves *no* testing is the true non sequitur.

More wild assumptions of little value to the discussion.

I don't dispute the merits of QA. However, if the resources aren't 
there, they just aren't there. They try to find a balance between 
potential customer dissatisfaction and development costs. At this stage 
of the game, do you really think they see the need for footing the bill 
for the same level of QA and development procedures you might see in a 
mission-critical enterprise application or world banking transaction 
system? The practices you're demanding have their place, but I really 
find it hard to justify them in an aging MMORPG with a dwindling player 
base. They're striking a balance here. Simple as that.

I understand it quite well, thank you. I also understand that the burden 
of proving that they do not test changes at all is squarely on *you*. I 
think it's you who are a bit unrealistic with your lofty standards under 
the circumstances. Face facts. It's not worth it to SoE to put the sort 
of resources toward this game that you demand. If it were, they would.

And if your inability or stubborn refusal to consider anything other 
than simple negligence ("that's the way it is, because I say so!!!") as 
the root of the problem is supposed to represent your efforts to "keep 
this on an adult level", then you're not trying very hard.
