Ok, In this situation, what you need is not the primary tank, but the
bulldog tank, Usually a hybrid.  whose job is to gank the Mobs off the
healers/casters so that the rest of the party can continue to kill the
rest of the mobs.  But, you say, "Hybrids can't tank as well as
warriors".  True, but my "tissue paper" ranger tanks a whole bunch
better than your chanter or wizard.  and at least as well as a cleric or
shaman or druid and oddly enough, doesn't need to be casting long heals. 

Ok, now a note to the healers/casters.  When the Bulldog pulls the Adds
off you,  step back, so that he can train them back to the other tanks. 
Otherwise when he starts moving backwards they will switch back to
nearest mode.

You need someone who can pull aggro.  and just one someone.  not two. 
Otherwise you have 3 tanks on 3 mobs and you might as well be soloing.

Bulldog is a job, just like puller or main assist or main healer or
mezzer.  Get that sorted out before it gets hairy.

Say something, if you get in trouble, Yes, I know that you enchanters
can't take many hits, but unless you have SoW on,  you are going to get
hit running or not, and running, you will get hit in the back for full
damage.

Get organized.  I left 2 groups this weekend, one I left too late(TPW),
because there was no organization.  That and I had higher ac/hp than the
4 levels higher "main" tank.
