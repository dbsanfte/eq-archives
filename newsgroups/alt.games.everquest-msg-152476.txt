I'm sorry to hear of your loss, losing anyone to any disease when so young
is hard.

I wanted to pass something along to you.  If you give a little bit of blood
through a private blood bank, you can have your marrow tested.  Being on the
list to donate marrow is rewarding and it doesn't cost any money.  If you
can't afford to give to every chairty, you might think about your marrow.

I have donated bone marrow twice.  It's not painless, it's not pretty, but I
have never felt better for it.
