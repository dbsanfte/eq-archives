Just want to correct a slight misperception here. One PvP cannot make your
whole night a wasted effort. There is no Exp loss from PvP on PvP servers.
Now if you were trained, or otherwise made to take an exp death from a
PvP'er that is a reportable and bannable offense. As long as I "Loot n
Scoot"(1) Ive not had any problems with PK's. On the single occasion where
someone tried to corpse camp me, I simply consented one of my newbs to drag
my corpse and used the newb to drag the body to an area where my main could
loot it in peace. I understand that this may not have worked on SZ ( I think
SZ is "Free fire" PvP with no level restrictions, unlike Vallon Zek where I
play. )

In any case the onlythink you loose in PvP ( at least on Vallon where I
play ) is any coin that you may have on you at the time, and one learns to
ditch coin in the bank ASAP on a Vallon Zek  : )
