  New batch of goblins in BB last night, as well as faction changes for
killing the old ones.  Now you get King Xorbb.  Heard a lot of people
talking about the new goblins being around level 30ish and kicking ass.
There was also a 'Crazed Goblin' that was a little higher than the others.
  If they have a decent spawn rate might be a nice camp to go through that
hell level.

  Sucky news for my mage about Najena though, was hoping to take him down
there to get my focus items but now that it's beefed up. :(  Gonna have to
buy them.
