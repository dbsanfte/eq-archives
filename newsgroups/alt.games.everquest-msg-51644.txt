For player made jewellery you want Fire Opal Rings (Velium are 6ac 65hp,
others are cheaper but not as good). Or you could go for Jagged Bands (ac5
3str) at about 30pp each.
For earrings I always go for Gold Topaz (ac3 8vd Disease) but Orc Fang and
Cougar Claw ears are so cheap now you could probably get those.
But as a rule of thumb as a warrior, if it doesn't have AC on it don't wear
it.
