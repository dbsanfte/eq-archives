I was contemplating if or not I even wanted to reply to this, being ot. and
then again if I wanted to leave your message intact and reply to specific
parts.. as you can see I chose not to do that.


Just a couple of things ive noted along my way, trucks are not very fuel
efficient, not like cars are.. sure some are better than others, but its one
of those special olympics kind of deals.. so arguing that point is flawed.


as far as v6 versus v8 I have no opinion on this, outside of wanting a v8
for speed, but that also relies heavily on a quality transmission, fuel
injectors, and as an added boost.. super charger.  (yes, a turbo charger
would be more fuel efficient than a super.. but lets face it my ideal ride
clearly isnt that efficient to start with:) )


one more thing of note, have you considdered your hybrid options? It it
would cost about 600 dollars usd to convert your pickup to a natural gas
hybrid. your efficiency would be dramatically increased.  theres also
hydrogen options but this isnt really mainstream... and it would be kinda
hard to get a refill if you dont live in cali or whereever they are
currently doing this to try to turn people onto it.



Hey,  I know what you guys are thinking in ref to my ideal car.. but im not
entirely 'juvenile' in my ways.. the car I want to drive is a pontiac grand
prix gtp super charged(even though its only a v6) and I even want the 4 door
version of it, not the coupe..... but im just as fond of the toyota
corrola.. im a little strange that way.
