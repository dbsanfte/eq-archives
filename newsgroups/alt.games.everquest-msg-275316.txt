You can't.  Just like you can't actually back up your misconceptions with 
real fact.  You can sit here and scream that I'm wrong, but you can't 
actually tell me why.  There's a reason.  It's because I'm right.  But it's 
easier for you to sit here and say "I know better than you" than to have to 
see that you're wrong.
