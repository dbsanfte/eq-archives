Why should I be able to "agree with other desire's [SIC] to not allow
me to inspect them" just because you agree with my right to inspect
them?  That would be about like saying, say, since you agree with my
right to not have to listen to someone else's stereo booming next
door, I should agree with their desire to blast their stereo as loud
as they want.
