Yeah, I've seen those in Bazaar.  Not quite as many "Casino!" messages
as EC, but they're there.

I don't mind the /auc WTS and WTB messages.  You can always turn /auc
off.  But I really get tired of people shouting their auctions or
going OOC with them.

I haven't run into any beggars in Bazaar yet.  I never really saw
them in EC either.  Just in the Freeport bank all the time.  Idiots.
