Then why do SK's and Pallys already have 100% effective ways to taunt
and close to the damage mitigation of warriors? Or are we just ignoring
their current preferability in experience groups in PoP over warriors?

As a cleric, I prefer an SK or Pally in groups anywhere from PoV to BoT.
It might cost a bit more to heal them but it saves the ton of mana
healing the shaman or enchanter who gets agroed from debuffing and needs
those expensive fast heals to stay alive.

So basically, the game is already trivialized. 100% taunt is already
here, just not on the class that needs it.
