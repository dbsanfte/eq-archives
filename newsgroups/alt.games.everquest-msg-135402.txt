First off, you have no idea what I consider weakness, second off, you
also have no idea what I consider "social duty" and blasted little room
to tell me what it is and isn't.

hahahaha  See, *that's* exactly what I mean when I say you haven't the
*slightest* clue about the U.S.  Characterizing U.S. gun owners as
"hillbillies in white sheets" is so far from the truth it's ludicrous. 
Fed stats show that the *vast* majority of firearms owners in the U.S.
are well educated and *never* commit a crime greater the speeding and
jaywalking.  You spout this unfounded newsmedia *crap* and then expect
people to take your other statements seriously?  hahahaha

> are a match for your government?

Idiot.  It doesn't have to be a "match" it just has to make them think
twice.  According to German records, the *very* same setup was
instrumental in keeping Germany from invading Switzerland and Japanese
records show that they *instantly* gave up any idea of a mainland
assault on the U.S. for exactly the same reason.  They didn't want to
have to slog through snipers every step.

Which has squat to do with your baseless assertion.

And your prejudices have prevented you from seeing the truth when it's
presented to you.

A long time ago?  Doofus. WWII Vets are all over the place.  They're
still *alive*.  Constantine was "a long time ago."

I'm pointing out reality.  Not my fault if you prefer to be blind.

"Millions"!?!?!  Where the heck do you *get* this absolute *tripe*?  Do
you even *know* what the U.S. firearms homicide statistic was last
year?  For the last *decade*?  "Millions"?  What a maroon.

What, are you a practicing troll or something?  Or are you yet again
showing your ignorance of the U.S. and assuming that something you've
been fed about U.S. firearms owners being racist?  For the edification
of anyone else reading this thread, the vast majority of U.S. firearms
owners are *not* racists.  They are *not* a member of the Klu Klux Klan,
the Neo-Nazis, or some weird "militia" group.  They are, despite
Daniel's bizare and unfounded believe otherwise, well adjusted, normal,
sane, compassionate, sensible, well educated, hard working people.

Yes, well, it's fairly established that you find the truth difficult to
believe and aren't particularly willing to check it out for yourself,
preferring instead to believe whatever hogswallop your local
hopolophobes have fed you.

Here's a quote from a comparatively recent post to RMA (just so it has
proper attribution):

---
    Each year 300 children under age 5 die in swimming pool drownings. 
Over
2000 each year are treated in emergency rooms for swimming pool
submersion
injuries (Source: U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission).  For
children up
to 14, that number comes to 940 deaths in 1998 (National Center for
Health
Statistics, National Mortality Data, 1998).

    The total number of deaths of children under 15 from gunshot wounds
was
629 in 1997.  Of those, 127 were due to suicide (gun laws irrelevant)
and
346 were due to assault (gun laws also mostly irrelevant, how many
people
are physically able to kill a 14 year old with or without a gun, let
along a
5 year old). (Same source the preceding year)

    Drowning is the number one cause of death for children under 5 is
Florida, Arizona, and California, with a ranking of number two in over a
dozen other states.

Do you *really* want to compare how many guns there are in the U.S. vrs.
how many Swimming Pools there are or will you just admit that you were
wrong?

Hey, don't bother projecting your prejudices onto us.

But *you* don't get to decide what's "unjustified" or "pointless."  In
fact your opinion in the matter is utterly irrelevant.

We are.  The fact that Afghanistan isn't a glowing plain of glass and
that instead in a comparatively bloodless and surgically targeted
campaign has removed the previous, rabid, government shows exactly how
restrained and compassionate we *are*.  What do you think the ancient
Roman Empire (magically transported to the 21st Century and given
nuclear weapons) would have done?  Too archaic for you?  What do you
think India would have done had 3,000 of their citizens been incinerated
in one fell swoop?  Heck, fill in the frag'n blank!  Egypt?  Russia? 
How many of them would have frag'n airlifted *FOOD* to the people who
every one *knows* have Al Qaida and Taliban members hiding among them? 
Name the country that you *honestly* think would have conducted the
campaign *more* humane and surgically targeted campaign?  In the words
of Chas, "here, use this line."  _____________________________

Evidently I've been paying attention while you've been letting yourself
be hornswaggled with bogus information and outright lies.  "Millions of
dead" indeed.  <scoff>

It's a bit more the "a few farmers here and there."

"Hateful devices"?  Are you aware that you're attributing human
characteristics to *inanimate* objects?  I'd suggest that you *try* to
look at actual facts without letting your obvious prejudices cloud your
judgment but I somehow doubt that you could.  "I've made up my mind,
don't confuse me with facts!"

Dude, there are *lots* of WWII vets still alive.  I have dinner with
some on a regular basis.

Which is all nice and emotional and *still* has squat to do with the
issue.  Nice dodge though.

I feel kind of bad humiliating you this way though.  Maybe the guys on
the Zen group can offer some advice.
