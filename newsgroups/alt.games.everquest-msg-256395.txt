This is ihmo debatable. :) If you're going to pull and need Fading
Memories than leave the mindbuff on. It's raw mana addition isn't
marginal.

You're correct. It doesn't do anything for bards.

I'd click of haste. Really! The original poster said he was needing a
slot for his epic proc. So he will be hasted most of the time due to
epic.
Besides, bard melee isn't as good as it looks like. I love to melee as a
bard. Walking into the fray with both hands swinging weapons should
yield a better result imho. But one parse brought my feet down on the
ground again. :) Even though we get double attack as an AA and dual
wield and have quite good weapon profficiency caps it doesn't help bard
melee. :( Long story but my point is: click off haste. If you use your
epic.
