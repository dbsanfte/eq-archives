My point is, don't get all pissy when you give your friend a key to your
place, and be surprised to find he ate all your food, drank your beers, and
trashed the place!!

Know the people who you give such *critical* information to and just being a
"friend" in EQ should not be criteria to my ATM PIN#, or EQ account
information!

The bottom line is, don't ever give out your account information.
