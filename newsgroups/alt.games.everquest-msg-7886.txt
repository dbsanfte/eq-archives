Get the Tink Bag as soon as possible, it will make your monk much more
enjoyable to play and it will help your monk make more money in the long run
because you can carry more loot. I bought a Tink Bag before any weapons or
anythign else. I dont regret it at all. Unless your other char's are
considerably higher level than your monk, or if your monk is your main,
forget twinks for awhile. Your monk is going to be poor for a long time, he
needs all the cash he makes not your twinks.
