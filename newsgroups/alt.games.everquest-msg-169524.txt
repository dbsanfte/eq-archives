The biggest problem with PoP is you can grief another guild SO easily..
whether intentionally or not..

All trials should have a similar difficulty "entry" mob who you must kill
before the real mobs pops...
No loot/no flags mob who stays up permanently, but when killed, pops the
real mob.  After say an hour, the mob poofs.. trigger mob pops again when
the mob is next due (ie 3 days later).. much the same as Idol/AoW

As it stands, a single person with invisibility can prevent EVERY other
guild from accessing hohb simply by saying 3 little words every 3 days..
thats fucked up

One of the biggest "complained about" guilds on Prexus is Japanese.. many
posts in the past about ksing, ninjaing, training etc.. all met with the
reply of "no english"..

They aren't very big, so we don't run into them often.. a little while ago
though, we were doing a 2 group Doze raid (boss of HoT)
my group consisted of 3 wizards (2 with Dragonbane) and 2 65 monks..  Db
wizzies can easily dish out 70k dmg in a Doze fight.. so theres no doubting
we had a VERY damage-poweful group.   Jap_guild with ZERO wizards had
started whacking the mob 3/4 of the way through, and for some stupid reason
(hi memblur) they got the exp on him.

We didn't find much we could say to them about stealing our kill, or
potentially stealing our loot, when we were met with "nim nim! no engel!
sorry me engash"

Using language barriers to cover up your stealing/griefing = fucking lame..
I prey for the day my guild gets a fluent Japanese speaking person! (we have
an Arabic, several HK and a lot of euro ppl alrdy)
