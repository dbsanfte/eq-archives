1. I have heard rumors and snippets that someone completed the Tome of Ages
Quest. I know it's supposedly broken, but if anyone has any info on it, it
would be greatly appreciated.

2. Where the HELL does a level 40 Wizzy go to get fast, HHK-like XP? And if
I see a reply stating "Dreadlands", I will absolutely vomit. =)

Thanks!
