You have to look at it more objectively. 

Whenever there is a problem with the routes to the EQ servers or the
servers themselves, or some ISPs, people will post to the group before
researching or waiting a reasonable amount of time (like an hour or
two) for the problems to clear up. The old-timers here have very
little patience for that type of post. 

In your case, the title was misleading, and your question/assumption
regarding the overall state of EQ (based on your going LD) was
rediculous. Is it any wonder you were flamed and laughed at a bit?

Dousing yourself with gas and running into a room full of fire-bugs is
not very smart. Laugh it off and move on.
