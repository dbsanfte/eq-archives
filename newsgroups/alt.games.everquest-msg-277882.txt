You went to the wrong gypsy camp.  Keep looking.

Or maybe you're confused, as "they don't seem to offer any tasks *related to
DoN factions*" is unclear as to whether you can't find anyone to give tasks
or you're getting tasks but you don't think they're related to DoN faction. 
Any tasks given in Lavastorm are related to DoN factions.
