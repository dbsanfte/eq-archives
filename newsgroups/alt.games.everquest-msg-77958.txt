Well, yes, if I have to. Resisted mezzes put you on the hate list too you 
know.

I find with a non-hasted mob and good timing I do not need color. I simply 
mez after they hit me.

What is your CHA at? CHA directly affects your mezz, charm, and other 
spells resistances. Raise it as high as possible.
