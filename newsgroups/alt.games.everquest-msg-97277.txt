Depending where your coming from, I find hugging the walls works great. From
DL, i simply make a right and hug the east wall while heading north. One of
the Key things is to Get as high up the wall as possible. Both the Lake and
Over There zones are on the top of the walls.

This is probably why you missed the zone.

G'luck
