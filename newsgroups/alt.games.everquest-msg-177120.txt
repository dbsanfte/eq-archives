Identify is another spell like this.  If my necro researches the
spell, it is a necro only spell.  He can buy teh spell from a npc
vendor and it lists many more classes.  Apparently you bought a
researched copy and the character that did the research was a
necromancer.  Limit your bazaar searches by both class and race; then
check to see if a religion is required before making any purchases.
