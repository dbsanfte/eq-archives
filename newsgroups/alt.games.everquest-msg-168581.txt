I think it is still possible to be something of an arch conservative
if all you say is "no additional government powers" today. But, you're
right in that I should have added that American conservations can also
be reactionary as well as static.

Of course, it's when our fellow conservatives like Trent Lott say the
country would be in much better shape if we'd stayed segregationist
that I want to hide and pretend to be a liberal.
