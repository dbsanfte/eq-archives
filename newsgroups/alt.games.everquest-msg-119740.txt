Keep in mind that wizards and Shaman can use Levitation also, and neither of
them have an alternative, also, SoE doesn't work indoors, so if you need
levitating, you'd need bat wings.

FotH has the same mana regen as breeze, not much, but better than nothing.

Not quested spells, rare drops from PITA mobs in the Deep and Tenebrous
Mtns.

That's an understatement.  I think if I had one of the two, I'd just auction
it off rather than scribe it, since with the profit from that one spell
(over 25k I've seen offered for either of them) I could probably pick up a
few nice items that I don't really have any hope of getting any time soon
otherwise.
