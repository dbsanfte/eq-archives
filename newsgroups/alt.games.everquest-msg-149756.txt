Oh no.  I'm a faction whore.  If I can't run, I just die ^^ I'd rather 
lose the exp than the faction.  I'm actually thinking of seeing if 
guildies don't want in on this.  I found a new guild awhile back and 
they're loads of fun - lots of people always on, and everybody's always 
saying "hey we should group at such and such".

Welllll if you think of what it'd be like with HGs... :)  "Okay, the 
level 60 warrior will sit here and taunt constantly, and you try and 
pickpocket all you can."

Yuppers.  It's at 163 atm.

Oy, tell me about it.  If I have to sit in front of that door in 
Befallen for one more minute... (but it's going to be more like one more 
hour at least, and I haven't even found a trap I can practice disarming 
yet.  Yeesh. Although at least "sense traps" when bound to the left and 
right arrow keys gets maxed in all of, oh, 5 minutes...)

True :)

Well, apparently there is, when you start killing people.  Who knew?
