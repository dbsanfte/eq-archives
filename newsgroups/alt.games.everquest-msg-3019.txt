The Oasis route is fine for good races. It's very easy, and I've taken a 17
Monk and a 15 Druid (their earliest trip) back and forth several times in
the past.

Once the raft stops at the island in Timorous Deep, swim east along the
coast (if memory serves me correctly) and climb onto the first Dock that you
see. Wait for the "Bloated Belly" to make its appearance and get on.

When you zone into The Overthere, keep looking to the left side of the boat
and when you come abreast of the large section of wall jutting into the
water, jump off and swim to shore. Looking at it from the water, you will
want to get bound just to the right of the Wall (inside the Outpost). Stay
close to the water (climb the hill and die), and no harm should come to
you... I've been there literally dozens of times with my Monk with no bad
consequences.

After getting bound SWIM around the wall and be on your merry way :)

Regards,
Matt K
