You forgot to mention that East wing is also called HoT (Halls of Testing)

West wing and the entry area between the wings is on CoV faction.
East wing is factionless and KoS to all
North wing is on some faction that is KoS to all but also lowers CoV when
you kill them (Guardians of Veeshan is it?)
