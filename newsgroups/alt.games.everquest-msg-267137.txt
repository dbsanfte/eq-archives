Thanks for the input guys. It turned out to be due to laziness. I copied a 
few ini files so I didn't have to change settings for hotboxes, socials, 
chatbox colors etc. etc. Although I made sure none of them contained 
anything other than UI settings it apperantly did. After changing numerous 
things, some of which was mentioned in your posts, nothing changed and I 
deleted all ini files from the EverQuest directory. The patcher loaded 3 new 
files, defaults.ini, loginsettings.ini and eqlsClient.ini and from then on 
it runs as never before!
