  Hmmm.  In all the time I've spent in the commons
on Drinal, and I've spent alot, I've very rarely
seen the belts going for 5pp.  2-3pp is more like
the norm.  You got lucky.
   OTOH, bonechips seem to sell for what most 
servers might consider to be inflated prices.
I've sold a few stacks for 10pp, and several
stacks for 5pp each.  Of course, this was by
looking for WTB auctions, rather than doing
WTS myself.

Annie <--- Loves the WTS auctions where some
           yahoo wants 30pp for a purity belt.
