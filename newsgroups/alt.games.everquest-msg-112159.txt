o.k listen up dill weeds, your back talk isnt making any sence.. one
person said yes you do get a free 30 days after you purchase the game,
another said that i have bad grammer and that i dont have a job
because i dont know how to spell. well whoopy-do, am i suppose to be
perfect like jesus or something? god, you guys think that once i try
to make a speech that i better not make one mistake or im royaly
screwed, well fug you. you ugly bastards of ever quest have no life,
thats all you gay racist perpentrators can do is sit there in your
mama's basement and fling boogers up at the ceiling and googling naked
women on your internet cause you guys will never get laid in your
life, youll never have it as good as ultima online cause youll
continue to support such a off beat service such as ever-quest, dont
be a arsehole... get a life... dont spend your hard earning money on
this game when all your doing is feeding the trolls (who are the
programmers of this game) why should one have to pay anyways? fuck
them... games should be free... lazy bastards, if one buys the damn
game, it should be free, no strings attached... so while you wack your
tiny peters off on a female orc just remember that female could be a
man, a man that could be the creater of this game... dont be a
dummy... dont support ever quest.. or again your all gay! the end!
