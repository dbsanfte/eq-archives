If they were smart they could work it. Basically... what you are
doing, whichever way you go about it, is setting up a bank inside
Everquest. In other words.. there has to be a banking system behind
the scenes in order to protect the online $$.. whether in actual cash
values or a placeholder. As such, fuck it, they should approach a real
bank, i'll use Bank of America as an example, and look to back end the
game account to a special bank account overseen by BoA expressly for
this purpose. 

Setup is as follows.. you walk into Bank of America.. show
identification and setup an account with them for this purpose. The
account in the real world works just like a regular account.. you can
be sent ATM cards.. if you set it as checking write personal checks
off it, and shit.. if you set it as savings you can even draw
interest. The trick is that when you get in game.. using a public-key
encryption method(preferably tied to a storage device which is created
for you when the account is setup and ties into a normal USB port and
of which the storage device is form factor to a credit card and will
fit in your wallet as such) the game verifies who you are through the
bank and has normal access methods for manipulating the account in
game. You can get a balance, and use the money or whatever
placeholders to purchase items in game.

Now, the benefits.. the main key here is that because it is an actual
bank, the money you have is not only insured by the US Federal
Government up to a certain amount, but BoA actually does something
that no online game has, they have who you are. If you decide to go
AWOL on the transaction they can first pay the bill and then use the
full power of the court and credit system to fry you 7 ways from
Sunday. Is it still open to fraud? Sure.. but an entity like SoE can
sit back while a banking establishment that allready has such features
setup goes after you like a dog in heat. It would take development to
adapt both the current online features of a bank to the Everquest
front end.. and if SoE were smart they would work with the bank to
standardize the protocols and submit them as open standards for
adapting banks to online games. If the standard is picked up by the
various banks and they adapt their systems to it.. hell.. you could
have a Gaming Account with any bank in the world. And as other games
support it you can use that Gaming Account with any game.

That's the beauty of using a brick-and-mortar bank. Its all insured by
the Feds.

Its actually much easier setting it up for the user to do, it has a
lot less overhead with a substantial upfront capital investment, and
would only work if they worked with a bank on it and got some Smart
People(tm) to actually design the system and then implement it. And
really.. all Everquest and a bank would do is charge a combined
transaction fee to cover the cost.. say $.50 or $1 an item
transferred.
