If the Parents had been acting responsibly, they would have TOUGHT THIER
CHILDREN about guns, and that they are NOT toys, then this issue would not
exist.  To many  parents want to be friends
with the kids, and not be a responsable grown up.  That is the real reason
so many kids are the way they are now days.   That is the problem with
Liberalism.  Nobody should be held accountable for their actions.  If it
feels good, do it.  And the hell with the consequenses.

I know, my spelling in totally shot.  3 in the morning.

Just my 2 cents worth.

Now go Play EQ and quit ranting!!
