Go to the "Options" button, then from there hit the "Display"
button.  About halfway down you'll see a resolutions setting,
just click on it to roll through from 640x480 (the default)
to 800x600, then again to 1024x768.  While you're there,
you should probably also flip the "screens same resolution"
setting, otherwise your monitor will have to switch video modes
every time you go back and forth from full screen mode to
the "small screen/lots of menu buttons" mode.

Speaking of which, if you haven't found it yet already, try
hitting "F10" a few times...  Most people prefer to play
in the "full screen" mode, and only switch back to the
"small screen/buttons" mode when they need to access certain
menu options.

You can customize most of the interface in full screen
mode even without Velious.  Velious just adds a "transparent
overlay" inventory window which is really nice.

In full screen mode (F10), you can turn on or off most of
the information panels, and/or resize them and move them
around on the screen.  For example, "alt-M" toggles on or
off the menu bar.  Clicking on the little square
at the top left of a window lets you start moving it around
the screen with your mouse -- put it where you want it,
then click again to lock it in place.  A similar action
on the lower right "little block" (if any) allows you
to resize the window.
