Hello All;
I'm new to EQ and loving it.  I've just bought the Atone spell and trying to
figure out how/when to use it.  On various forums and this great NG I see
someone reference using it with things like root and stun. The spell
description says something like this spell erases the hate/damage list from
the monster. I tried it once, rooted a monster and cast Atone on it 2 or 3
times. When the root stopped the monster just walked off.  I see other more
experienced players referring to it, but I can't pick up on why or when to
use it.

My question:  when or why would I use something like this in a group fight?

Thank you all in advance for your time in helping/teaching me.
