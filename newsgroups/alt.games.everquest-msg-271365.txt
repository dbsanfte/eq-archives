"Cute" is annoying;  knowing a slow has landed or
a CHeal is coming or an add has been mezzed is
useful, at least in many situations.   I've always
called CHeal, simply to avoid backup healers
wasting mana.  Slow is another I like to hear; it
tells me when I need to recalculate damage rate
so I can save mana.   And so on...

But, yes, it's the "Putting %T to sleep, someone
get it's blanky!!" messages repeated over and over
since it's attached to the cast, not the success,
that's annoying enough to make you go solo.. :D
