As others mentioned, you do get that free month with the purchase of the
software.  The question is what software to get?  I've seen just the
original EverQuest for $5 at Wal-Mart.  gogamer.com recently had Planes of
Power, which includes the original EQ, for $10 plus shipping but I haven't
checked recently to see if that sale is still going.  The EQ trilogy can
usually be had for $20 or less.  I don't know the details of Sony's free
download of the original EQ and free trial period but you might check their
website and/or customer service.  Good luck!
