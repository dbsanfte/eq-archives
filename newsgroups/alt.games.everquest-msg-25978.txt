"Togole Bitties" is a good example of the right way to have fun with
names.  The first name, Tigole, is perfectly acceptable by itself.  In
fact, it sounds like a fantasy name.  It is only when combined with
the last name that you get something {funny|offensive|cute|stupid}
(take your pick), and even there it will take a moment for most people
to notice...you won't tend to notice unless you sound out the name.
If you just run by Tigole in passing, you are unlikely to notice, and
since last names do not show up on /who or on tells and shouts and
ooc's and auctions, most people won't even get that far.

I don't understand what's wrong with Manalope.  He used to be Manalope
Cantalope, I believe, before he earned a title in some event, so had
his last name changed to "the Vicar".
