You'll have to tune the % at which to back off and FD, and how much
participation the Necro will need to give, I'd recommend he snare and
/pet attack with some dots, just enough to do some damage, and keep
stable manawise.  Don't forget enchanter mind buffs, etc.  Gunthak, OS,
Dulak, Dawnshroud, all are places that might provide good
opportunities.  and 2/3 of 53 is 35.
