The guild wants a PLed cleric, right?  Well, you're supplying one character,
make someone else supply their high level druid.  Druids are the KINGS of
PLing any class up to level 40 or so (exact level debatable).  For melees
shaman/cleric are the contenders, most people saying shaman (which I tend to
agree with).  For clerics...dunno, I still think druid (heals, snares,
damage shields, transportation) though shaman (heals, slows) have their
up-sides, too.
