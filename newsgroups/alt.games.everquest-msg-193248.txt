A lot less xp. There is an xp bonus for having a group, there is an xp 
penalty for having a raid.

First time I went to a PoP zone, was a 1.5 group raid in RCY, I was level 
56 or so.  The xp was simply amazing.  Then, I went back with just a group, 
and found out just how much of a penalty using raid was, the xp was simply 
insane then.
