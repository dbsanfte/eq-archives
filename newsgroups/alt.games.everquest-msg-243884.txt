IMO, it's actually the ranger's responsibility to make sure they have a 
clear LOS and switch to melee if anything even *might* get mezzed in their 
path.  Better to get that mob that's hitting the healers for 1k mezzed 
wherever it happens to be standing than for me to be doing a few more dps 
than if I were meleeing.
