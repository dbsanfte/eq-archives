Hmmm  If you're going to do a pickup of an additional member or so,
why not do enchanter, cleric  and rogue.   Max the melee damage, have
the crack dealer and the superior healer.   There are so many tanks
and would be tanks out there you'll be able to have full groups and
take on anything a single group can all the way to the big six oh
Additional thoughts, please?
