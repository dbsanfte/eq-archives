No problems with a SB Live! here. Running XP, Athlon XP 1500+, 256Mb
Ram, and inbuilt graphics (soon to change to GeForce2 MMX golden
sample). Didn't even install any drivers - just plugged it in and it
worked. I haven't used it much yet though - I'll have yet to check if
EAX is working for example.

I like XP so far (overall - it has its faults), but am not sure if its
worth the upgrade -  I got it with a new PC.

HTH,
Toby
