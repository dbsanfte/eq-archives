Addiction is the problem of the user not the product (with the
exception of chemical dependencies). More people are "addicted" to the
following than EQ....

Talk Radio
TV Soaps
"Must See" TV
NFL
MLB
NBA
Internet Chat rooms.
The Sims
etc
etc
etc

EQ is a game. Nothing more and nothing less. If people let it rule
their lives, that is their decision (and their mental defect). There
is NOTHING in the code of EQ that is addictive. It's just a lot of
fun.
