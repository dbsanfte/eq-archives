At least for the mid-50s and upper-50s dungeons, you only
really need part of that.  (upper-50s = L58 average group,
"trash" mobs average about L55, around half are yellow con
to L55, and they are the weakest L55ish mobs I've ever
fought).  What you need is some sort of CC, off-tanking
alone isn't enough but off-tanking plus root parking is,
some sort of runner control (earth pet is almost enough by
itself, don't laugh, I quit stunning runners in a 3 pet
group), and healing adequate to your circumstances (gotta
be a Cleric if you have no slower, for instance).  Really,
most any collection of classes seems adequate, provided the
players are skilled enough.  As for planning, my last three
missions the planning has consisted of the group leader
asking "kaev, are you a good puller?" or words to that
effect in group chat.

KEI is common, but not guaranteed.  Virtue and Aego are also common,
but by no means certain.  The buffs aren't decisive anyway.  In the
three pet group I mentioned above (58 epic mage, 57 mage, 60 BL) I
had Virtue dispelled about halfway through.  I didn't even bother to
ask the Druid for PotC, just put up Valor and an AC buff and the
Druid stopped using her incomplete heal and kept me up fine with
smaller heals.  I was tanking L56+ mobs as a 55 Paladin with about
3.3k hp and never came close to dying.  The mobs just don't hit all
that hard.

I have exactly two stuns that work on mobs over L55, and one of them
is a 4 second cast.  Still, if there are more Enchanter mobs there
that would explain why the pickup crowd avoids Guk (I have not yet
been there myself).  My last group we got some comic relief when the
Enchanter I was pulling charmed me and had me chasing the Rogue and
the Necro all over until the Necro's pet got on me, the mob didn't
come out until after the charm broke at which point we crushed it
in seconds, stupid AI.

Caution led to two of my four failed adventures (I started 1 and 4).
So, while I normally play somewhat cautiously, I have learned to be
a lot more aggressive in LDoN.  Once I see that my group is able to
dispatch the mobs I focus on keeping them engaged.  If the Cleric
wants to go pacify the next room while we fight to save time, that's
great (see Lance?  Clerics _do_ help you move faster!), depending on
the group I will have the next mob in camp before the current one
falls.  Double pulls are fine so long as I have one of another tank,
a mezzer, or a decent Shaman (for some reason most of the skilled
root parkers I've played with have been Shaman).

Aye.  I play in pickup groups, the chance of convincing a pickup
group to try a hard adventure is approximately equal to the chance
of winning the lotto without buying a ticket.  Hell, I can't even
get people to go to Guk.  And if a group stomps a dungeon, they
don't want to try a hard one for fun, oh no, they want to do the
same damned thing over again, and again, and...  Bah, it's the same
thing I commented on back when they nerfed L1 to L9 out of existence,
these players have been bred on video games, they've been conditioned
to see blowing up 6 bazillion instances of the same 4 mobs against a
handful of screen backgrounds as "fun".  Oh well...
