Hail all!

I'm new to the ng, new to the game and most things computeresque by the way.
Also, I apologize for my total newbiness but would like to submit a question
to this learned assembly.

Here goes:

I was told I could change the text colours in my dialog box by modifying my
eq.ini file. Could anyone please suggest a link for a simple and
user-friendly eq.ini modification utility?

Best regards,

Embarrassed in Montrï¿½al
