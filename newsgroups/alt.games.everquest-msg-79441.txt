It is, Drow were part of the early days of AD&D, they appeared in a book
known as Fiend Folio (which I seem to remember having something to do with a
UK mag called White Dwarf, when it was a roleplaying magazine) this was made
up of creatures created for adventures etc. I think these came from
tournament games.
This I remember was a series of adventures adventures that I believe
finished with Queen of the Demon Web pits.
I am now wondering if any of my old friends still have a copy of this, I
gave up Table top gaming a quite a few years ago but I still have friends
that do.
