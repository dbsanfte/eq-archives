Yeah I think this was the problem the first time I was shouting for about
30-45 minutes b4 i got a tell that the other ppl where coming and the person
AFAIK had not been in the zone.

:0( unfortunatly a new guild who does not yet have the numbers of high lvl
players to do this kind of thing.

And this is what I am doing now hopefully VSR will be up again in a day or 2
and I am frantically working on getting names.
To be honest I would not have petitioned this unless I did have the forces
to take out this mob but it does get on your nerves a little this stone is
the only thing stopping me from getting my elaborate and an extra 9wis would
be really nice atm.
