I saw that as well.  Maybe they can't make the legs narrower and add a dip
to the back, but the should be able to make the heads more realistic.  And
look at the one where two are fighting each other.  Look at the brown
horse's front leg.  That's just looks wrong.  Joints and the thickness make
it look like it was squeezed from a tube.
