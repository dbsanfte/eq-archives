Light sources, however, suck.  A lot.

With night vision, there's little difference between night and day, and you can go
anywhere you like, indoors or out, and see whats going on.

With a light source, your vision range drops to well under aggro range of many
mobs, and its often anyone's guess whats going on out there for half of each game
"day".  Yes, its lots better than no light source... but try heat vision once and
you'll never think of even a GLS in a dark confusing zone as "better vision"

I'd suggest King Tranix's (or whatever his name is) crown.
