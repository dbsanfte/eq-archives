I was hunting in Chardok a few months ago and 4 dropped in one hunt. They
were so common, the necromancer who was master looting for us "thought thye
were common drop junk" as he had no idea about melee stats and gave two
to his pet.

Sigh.

funniest thing? I noticed, we all screamed, and then 2 minutes later his
pet died to enrage.
