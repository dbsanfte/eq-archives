I think this is what he's after? I'm pretty sure this is soloable. I suspect you'd have to be a gnome though.

Module bazaar.cache

Cache and reference buffer classes.
Cache classes are used to buffer objects and association data loaded from database. There are two types of cache:

     * full:
           o objects - all objects of their class are loaded from database at once
           o association data - all data (for all application objects of given relationship between two classes) are 
loaded from database at once
     * lazy:
           o objects - only one object is loaded from database
           o association data - data are loaded for given application object

Cache and buffer classes are dictionaries. A dictionary contains pairs of primary key value and object identified by the 
primary key (object cache) or application object and set of primary key values of referenced objects (one-to-many and 
many-to-many association data cache).

Reference buffers contains objects, which does not have priamry key values (are not in database).
Every class and association has its own cache, which is configurable, see bazaar.config module documentation.
