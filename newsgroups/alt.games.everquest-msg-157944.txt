Better description:  It's in the hidden tunnel in the southeast
corner of the newbie area, a stone's throw from Ping Fuzzlecutter.

Just east along the path that runs past the newbie lift.


>Ogguk, 884, -160

This is out in Feerrott, you should mention.


>Rivervale, in Misty, can see a hut in distance: -544, -1263

West of the Misty druid rings.
