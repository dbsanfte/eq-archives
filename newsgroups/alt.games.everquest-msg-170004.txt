Well.

50k and a Fungi. More than I am ever likely to see ;)

If you are a grouping kind of guy, warrior is a good bet. If you like 
grouping and soloing, go for a monk or shaman. With a shammy in a fungi you 
can cannibalize to your hearts content. If it was NEC wearable that would 
be very nice also- a free clarity can't hurt ;)

Personally, I would go with the warrior. With a fungi and 50k to spend on 
gear, you can make an ass-beating warrior that could easily solo to his 
30's. Hell, outfitted right with that gear I imagine you solo do up to 15 
or so with no downtime at all. Monks would benefit there also, and be 
better at soloing, at least until the monk AC castration caught up with the 
sick twinkage ;)
