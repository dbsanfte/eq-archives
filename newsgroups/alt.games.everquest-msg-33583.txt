Yup, that's the case. And the Courier spawn doesn't seem to be along
the south or east walls, as some web sites would have you believe.

When I did this, I started tracking the Courier immediately after
killing Larik, and the tracking was leading me due north. Suddenly -
"You have lost your target" shows up. WTF?

I /ooc'ed if someone had killed him, and got an answer from a warrior
that he had just zoned in from GF, started down the trail and the
Courier attacked him. And yes, after the warrior killed the Courier,
he looted the no-drop item.

I got lucky, though. The warrior understood my predicament, and helped
me multi-quest the final step, so I still got my goodies. He was quite
apologetic about it, actually. He did what most of us would have done
- "I've never seen that mob before. Let's whack him and see what he
drops."
