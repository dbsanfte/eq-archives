Does it?  I've cut my pause as short as possible, but I occasionally notice
that the timing is still just a touch off (ie, I'll finish singing one song,
but not get the effect, and since my chat window seems to have a delay all
it's own, I use the casting timer to measure things...).  Maybe I need to go
back to double tapping?  It makes sense, though... three second cast time,
18 second duration... why can we only do a three song twist???  Well, other
than the fact that my songs don't seem to be lasting a full 18 seconds
anymore...
