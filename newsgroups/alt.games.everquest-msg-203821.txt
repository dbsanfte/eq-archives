Depends. Are you going to twink the SK? If so, all STA. If you are
going to work up from scratch, get your INT to 75 (Troll SK's start at
62) and the rest in STA. If you don't put any points into INT, when
you hit 9th level, you won't be able to summon your pet, along with a
lot of problems gaining skills in a lot of areas. In the end, the INT
won't help much, but it takes awhile to get to a point where those
extra points of INT don't matter, unless you twink.
