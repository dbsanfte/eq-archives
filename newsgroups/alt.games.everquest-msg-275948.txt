I wouldn't have a problem with the changes, if not for the fact that it
left alchemists almost unusables. See, this is what alchemists can do:
 - Components:   Useless now
 - Tank powers:   I have yet to sell a power for more than 30s, and my
alchemist is lvl 30, leaving him in merchant mode at least 8 hours/day
 - Potions:  Have you checked the stats on these?  a lvl 29 healing
potion that gives a whopping 40 health, or a mana regen potion that
gives 3 points every 6 seconds, at a level where everyone has about
1000 power is just laughable.  Add to this the fact that potions con
'gray' no matter what, nobody buys them
 - Poisons:  Only possible source of income, guess you could compare it
to provisioner, except for a few things: - Poisons last 12 hours and
have 4 uses each, so a customer may buy 1 poison a week if that (our
hope is that our customers die a lot LOL).  Also: - Everybody needs
drinks from provisioners, but only scout types need poisons, and many
don't even know about them.
 - Both poisons and potions: for some reason we can only consistently
make them from lvls x1 to x5  (the poisons from levels x6 to x9 require
bottles made from rare components to create! I'm not talking about rare
power poisons, no... ALL the poisons and potions we can make in those
ranges require a rare).

So there you see, alchemists are in real bad shape.

The funny thing is, I first created my alchemist not for money or
anything, I just wanted to make cool potions like speed, invisibility,
levitation, etc.  only to find out that we don't make them, woodworkers
do *Major boggle*
