The lack of statements about it from affected users is the evidence,
Dan.

To read LGs comments about the hacking, one is lead to think it must
be easy and commonplace. If it were, though, don't you think some
reliable word of it happening would have appeared here?

There can be no evidence for something that doesn't happen. I'm not
exactly going to pull up my newsreader each morning and post "No one
hacked my EQ account last night", am I?

>"Goddess" is asking you to provide that evidence

Yeah, I know. And I've been asking her to post her evidence of
Everquest account theft for some time now. I've yet to see anything
except multiple posts referring me to a book written about a decade
before EQ came out.
