Ok, I think I've heard enough people screaming "This is a war for oil!"
Here are two reasons *I* don't think this war is about oil.  Anyone who can
seriously refute them, feel free to do so.

(1)  If all we cared about is oil, why, oh why, did we call a *ceasefire* in
Iraq at the end of the Gulf War??  Why did we not just crush him (surely you
can't argue that we were *unable* to crush him), establish a "US-friendly"
regime, and have our oil supplies guaranteed for the (short-term) future?
Aside, of course, for the reasons that "friendly" regimes never work and
never have worked in history?  Of course, if you're going to say we didn't
do that because friendly regimes don't work then how exactly are we going to
grab his oil?  Do you think we're going to kill 'em all, take the place
over, and make it a US colony?  I'll bet you anything you want that's not
going to happen.

(2) If the sole reason for our involvement in the Middle East was oil -- we
could easily assure continuous and dependable oil supplies from all Arab
nations simply by withdrawing from the Middle East, dropping our Israeli
allies, and letting the Arabs do whatever they want whenever they want to do
it.  No more problem.  Yeah, maybe people like bin Laden would still hate us
for being "infidels" but people like bin Laden don't control oil supplies.
So why don't we just do that?  A war will cost money.  A war will (at least
temporarily) raise oil prices.  A puppet regime installed by such a war will
be only temporary, after which we'll be right back where we are now,
oil-wise.  By pulling our noses out of Arab business we could have all the
oil we want, cheaply, easily, peacefully, and without waging an expensive
war that makes many terrorist organizations angry at us.  Why the fuck don't
we just do that?  Unless -- this is the big one, you ready? -- unless!
Unless, incredibly enough, we actually have *other* reasons *besides* the
Oil God to invade Iraq!  Might that be possible?  Naw.  Of course not.  The
US is evil.  The US couldn't possibly have legitimate reasons for what they
do because otherwise they wouldn't really be evil.  So they must be bashing
everyone's heads in for fun.  Doesn't matter how much sense the arguments to
the contrary make.

Seriously, though, given the above reasons, does it really make sense to
argue that the war is about oil?  Or can you give me good, supportable
reasons that despite these arguments, the US still has no logical reason to
invade Iraq besides oil?
