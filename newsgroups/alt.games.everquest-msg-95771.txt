    I'd always thought that the XP penalties were first discovered by
ShowEQ'ers, so I wonder if the 1% is in fact true and VI doesn't know about
it. If the code with a pet in the group split the XP as if the pet had taken
a share, then gave it back to the group if the pet didn't get kill credit, I
could see rounding errors possibly chopping off 1% of the XP. Or any other
design where the XP gets split twice because a pet is present. Wonder what
the XP split is really like - any ShowEQ users want to do a few experiments?
