I'm *hoping* that it's only for raids.  Honestly, there's enough politics in
and out of EQ that I don't want to deal with people jockeying for group
leader positions when trying to get into a dungeon or something.  I have
this image of two people agreeing to LDON together, meeting at the camp, and
everytime one person invites the other, the other declines and invites the
first guy.... Who then declines and invites the second guy...  Who then
declines and invites the first guy...

...

Ow.
