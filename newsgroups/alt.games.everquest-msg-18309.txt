I confused the heck out of two Iksar newbies in Field of
Bone once.

My dwarf Paladin, in full Ro plate armor, holding a Soulfire,
was chatting with them, when I asked them, "want to see a
Paladin teleport"?  "Um... ok", they replied.

So I cast a spell and blinked out of the zone.

[I had died earlier and after looting, left my almost-naked
corpse around in case I could find an exp rez.  The Cleric
arrived at my body as I was talking to the newbies, so
I asked them the question, cast a random buff on myself
to make spell effects, then clicked "Yes" to accept the
rez and be zapped to my body...]
