Don't be silly -- you're not actually "selling" anything when you
trade items for plat in the game, you're just shuffling one in-game
representation for another.  You *are* selling something when
you accept RL cash for it.

If you want a more interesting loophole, consider:

# You may not use any third party software to modify the Software 
# to change Game play.

Technically speaking, you wouldn't be violating the letter of this
if you wrote your OWN software to "modify the Software to change
Game play", because that wouldn't be third party software, it
would be SECOND party software.  Third party software is software
that you acquire from an entity not involved in the agreement.

For example, if Oracle and Microsoft are doing a joint venture,
any software that either of them writes for the venture would
not be third party software, but software that they bought
or otherwise acquired from Sun Microsystems to use in the
project would be.

As a party to the EULA agreement, any software that you
yourself write would not be "third party software".

I'm not arguing that this gives you a license to actually
do so, just pointing out that as is so often the case,
Verant's writing leaves a lot to be desired in the
realm of clarity and/or precision.

On a related note, in the new Befallen, some of the
mobs collapse into a "heep" [sic] when they die.  Sigh.
