<<Anyone know of a weapon that when held gives the appearance of a scythe for a
necro with any stats that might be good for under 3k or so?  TIA>> 
Thanks for responses I'll definitely be looking for a Soul Reaper or a
Harvester and along the same lines can anyone recommend a nice black hooded
cape or robe?  Looking for that Grim Reaper look!!
