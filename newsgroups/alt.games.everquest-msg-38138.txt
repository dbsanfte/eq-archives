The short answer: No. It's not allowed. Were it to come to Sony's attention,
they could and likely would cancel all three accounts with no refund.
Slightly extended answer:  If nobody ever complained and you all share computers
anyway, odds are they'd never find out so it wouldn't matter.
Additionally extended answer: You better know these guys *REALLY* well, or your
an idiot to give out your user name and password to them. Let's just say two
months from now you're all out at a bar having a few beers and you make some
comment about Buddy_02's girlfriend's nice tits.  He get's really pissed off.
You get up the next morning, log on, and find all your stuff is gone and you've
lost twenty levels in a death loop all night. Ouch.
