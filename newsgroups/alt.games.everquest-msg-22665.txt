Take my word for it.
Go to Overthere, spend a couple levels in exp grinds and loot every
yellow pelt that drops from a tiger. Tiger pelts are the EASY
component; you have to get a pile of oak bark and morning dew
(especially morning dew - mithril studs require a ton of the stuff)
before you can start tailoring the stuff and I am now considering
dumping a few bagful's worth of pelts to free up bank space.

Tradeskills were not fun last night. I made 16 quivers burning about 6
of the pelts and got my single skill raise (81) on the first attempt
then nothing for 15 attempts. I tried some brewing and got one raise
(150) in 40 attempts at ginesh. I'm just going to save up money and
buy GE boots before doing more tradeskills, I guess... I have 50
crystalline swatches and am worried I might only get 5 raises from
them :)
