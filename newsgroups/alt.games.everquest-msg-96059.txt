Manastone was one of the truly unbalancing factors in the game.
It was removed from drop tables and is not useable in any new
or revamped zone for very good reason.

A cleric with a manastone has inexhaustible mana, with an amazing
regen rate.

It exchanged 60hp for 20m (as I recall) with *NO* cast time/recast
delay.  A buffed up cleric with (as an example) 3k hp can change
2400hp into 800m, in 40 clicks, complete heal in 10 secs for 400
mana (minus any spec decrease) and be up 400 mana in about 20 seconds.
Call it 24, 4 ticks, 100m/tick regen.

Of course, the manastone still exists, it's call a mage summoning
mod rods (trans rods are better, of course).
