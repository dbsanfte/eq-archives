Further research suggests that chapter 7 of said book may be relevant, 
somewhat.  Although he is dealing with studying discomfort caused by 
observing the stimuli, rather than whether or not we can actually see more 
data if we use a higher refresh rate.  But hey, discomfort is worht 
investigating too.

However, it is further suspicious, in reference to the flyer you initially 
cited, that they didn't reference this book in regards to their 85Hz 
figure, given that it may have data to support or disprove their 
contention, but cited only the data on fluorescent lighting instead.  Can 
they really only have read up to chapter 6, and skipped chapter 7, despite 
its title? :)

Alas, my university library doesn't have a copy.
