I am sooooooooooo waiting to find a chance to get into a group like that. I'm
sure that if I did, I wouldn't solo so much.  Even at lower levels, we have
groups camping things like the ruins in QH and the orc camps in EC. I've heard
some of those run really well, but I've yet to get in with one that did.
  In a different response in this thread, somebody else pointed out problem
similar to what I encounter. I'm not part of a guild, or any regular group of
players online. My work hours vary a lot, and I never know when I'll have a
big block of time to play. How do other folkes handle that?  You just /ooc
asking to get into a group and hope it's a good one? What's a good indication
if you've got a "good" group or not?

monk tonight.)
