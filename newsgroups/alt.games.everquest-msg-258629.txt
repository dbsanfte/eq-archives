He wont dual weild til level 16 or 17 or so, so get him a Lammy, a
Shield, and a haste item of your choice?  When he gets dual weild, if
you get that far with him, you may be close enough to 20 to break down
and get him a Wurmslayer...very good weapon for lower level Rangers,
even today.

Remember that the DS these gives you is determined by your level.  So
at level 1 you will probably have a 1 point DS.  One thing you can try
is to find a kindly 50+ Ranger to give you Call of Earth.  This is a
1-hour long, 4-point DS with some AC.

Not sure, do these also scale with level as well?

Temperence is a lot more HP (800 versus 250), a lot more AC, and lasts
a while longer (100 minutes versus 72).

> SOW potions... SOE would be nice but won't stick yet right?

Nope, it is a 54 buff for Druids so it is level restricted.

Maybe a wisdom buff if one is available, to help with the track skill
increases?  And may I suggest you use your training points getting
this up since that is what he is made for anyway?
