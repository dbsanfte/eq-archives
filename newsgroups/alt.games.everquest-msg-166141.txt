1. If you have any MS Office products remove or disable "Find Fast".
This is a program that runs in memory and attempts to index all of the
files on your HDD so that you can find Office docs faste. It SUCKS big
time and has been a proble with games for years.

*2. Disable ANY and ALL Anti-Virus software that may be running in the
background when playing EQ.

*3. Disable ANY and ALL ICQ, MS Messenger, Instant Messenget, etc
programs when playing EQ. These types of programs periodically "ping"
the net and can lead to stutters and pauses in net games.

4. Defrag all drives (especieally the drive containing  the EQ folder)

*Basically Kill any app running in the back ground when you play EQ.
