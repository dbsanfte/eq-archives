Your right, facing the zone choice.

If you are coming from DL to Karnors, or from inside Karnors
to DL, or likewise on either side of the COM/EJ line, you
won't be faced with a "nearest" option, unless its somehow a
couple feet closer on the diagonal.

Given that zoning one way or the other won't help save
get you away from that train any faster, you need to look
at the bigger picture.  IF everyone follows the convention,
then you won't be zoning -in- to a train.  Medding space
is a luxury, but a train free zone in area is a blessing.

How do you get that train free zone in?  By explaining the
idea to your groups, and to anyone medding on the "wrong"
side, and to the zone occaisionally in /ooc, and in /shout whenever
anyone hits the "TRAIN TO ZONE" toggle, and here on
the newsgroup, and basically getting out the good word.

OH, and by scrupulously observing it, even though until
the idea takes hold it won't actually make a Large Rat's
ass worth of difference to you.  Hey, at least it doesn't
make things any harder, unless you zoned in and want
to zone back out.

Do unto others as ye would have them do unto you.  Not
a selfless concept at all.
