My Vah Shir made it, but being classed as a "large" race (like the
Barbarian) I usually cast "Shrink" twice, to get REAKKY small.  Have
you tried that?  If not, it might work for you too.

Well, not as such - Rogues use Sneak/Hide to trade with all sorts of
otherwise hostile NPCs.  It takes a bit of planning and scouting
sometimes, but it always works.

Actually, on the subject of Shrouding to do something, the Evil Eye
Psion "Beholder Gaze" *might* do the trick of getting the trader to
deal with you, as well, but you'd have to get out asap as the charm
lasts about 18 seconds.  

I mention this as I recently used it to Charm the skeleton Foreman in
Overthere, to hand in the Jade and get the Worker's Sledgemallet.
That's the weapon that procs a teleport to a safe spot in the
Overthere outpost, during combat, if you've not seen it mentioned
before.  If anyone would like to know the details on how to do it,
I'll do a separate thread.
