He showed up the other night on Veeshan server and I took some pics
(http://triplemoons.tripod.com) of him alive and dead.  I was one of the
first to get to him and he was asking for goblin beads, in /say.  By the
time I finally got some and returned, there were 100 or so people attacking
him, and no one had a chance to turn in the item to see what would happen
next.  A bard named Hexter was able to ninja him and said he looted a Spider
Phase Carapiece as well as some par longsword.

Did anyone have a chance to turn in an item before he was attacked?
