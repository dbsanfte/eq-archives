Seems to me, where pick-up groups are concerned anyway, you will be in the 
same boat as every other MMORPG right now - having to often deal with 
nitwits who never took the time or had any desire to actually become good 
at playing their chosen class, because they never *had* to do so.

Of course it also seems to me that you've had that probem for quite a while 
now. This may exacerbate the problem, but it sure didn't create it.

Welcome to the mainstreaming of EQ. :/
