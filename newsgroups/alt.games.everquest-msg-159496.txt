Pipex broadband is no good if your area cannot take ADSL which I think 
is what the original poster inferred.

Personally i've been with Fast24 a year and they've had some huge issues 
but they have pretty much knocked those on the head. They now have a 
good business model and a good price. Not many offer 12 hr disconnects 
on an isdn line for under �15 a month :)

I too am also in an area that is not ADSL enabled like 44% of the 
british public which in 2002 is frigging ridiculous!
