Actually for comparing weapons of the same type, look at (damage*2+
1)/delay.  Better yet, get your damage bonus for each weapon you want to 
compare, and look at (damage*2+bonus)/delay.

For comparing a 2 hander to two 1 handers, look at (damage*2+bonus)/delay 
for the 2 hander, and (damage*2+bonus)/delay for the main hand one hander, 
and (damage*2+1)/delay (might just be damage*2/delay) for the off hand 
weapon.  Next you have to figure out how often you will get a successful 
dual wield attack with the off hand weapon, and adjust the value of the off 
hand weapon appropriately.

At level 65:

Stone Etched War Sword, 2 hand slash, 45/30 would be (90+36)/30 = 4.2
Ornate Greatblade, 2 hand slash, 35/23 would be (70+14)/23 = 3.65
The Sword of Ssraeshza, 2 hand slash, 52/42 would be (104+42)/42 = 3.48

Whereas calculated your way, 45/30=1.5, 35/23=1.52, 52/42=1.24, which would 
imply that the OGB is the better weapon of the three, which is actually 
true up to about level 45, after which the greater damage bonus of the SEWS 
overtakes the better ratio of the OGB.

The OGB has a better ratio than the SEWS actually, only slightly so, but 
better, if you only look at the rated damage vs delay.
