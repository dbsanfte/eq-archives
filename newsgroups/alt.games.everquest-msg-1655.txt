When did they add a re-cast time?  I haven't played my wizard much for the
past month, but at that time I didn't notice any re-cast time.  I think they
just lowered the aggro of the spell, as they did with tash, as a result of
it taunting too much and being used for unplanned things (warrior dual
wielding tash sticks can't lose the attention of his target, wizard spamming
flux on a HG can't lose the attention as the rest of his groups kites in
ease).
