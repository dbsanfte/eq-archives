I've been PLd by a druid, shaman, and a cleric . . . I'd say they all have
their good and bad points.  The druid was probably the fastest one.  The
shaman was around lvl 50 though and had some good buffs - allowed me to work
more on my own skills too.  The cleric was around lvl 60 so they had good HP
buffs, but I didn't get to work much on my skills.  All they did was beat up
the monsters to about 1 bub of health, then root them and mem blur them.  It
was pretty good getting the experience for no work though. LOL  Also, had a
wiz with a shaman once which worked well - wiz had DS and shaman could heal
and buff.  So...depending on how fast you want to go and whether you want
your own skills somewhat equal to your lvl . . . a druid or shaman would
probably be the best and druid first.  Plus you figure the druid has the
added ability to bring you where you want to go - luckily the shaman's have
SOW for the run :)
