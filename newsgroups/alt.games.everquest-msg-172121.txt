The /who filter I've wanted since the dawn of time (okay, ever since I
joined EQ) is /who zone.  e.g. "/who vexthal cleric"

To those who don't want folks to know what zone they're in, I'd support the
additional feature that if you went anon, you wouldn't appear in those
lists.

To answer your original question, it's easy to see who's in your group and
who's in your raid by looking at your group and raid windows.  I've got a
hotkey set up that does /whotarget, so when I join a group of folks I don't
know, I target each of them using the F2-F6 keys and hit my /whotarget
hotkey to see what level and class they are.  I imagined you could do
something similar in a raid, too, by using the raid window.

So there are ways to engineer your hotkeys to overcome the lack of a /who
group and /who raid filter.
