Out of curiousity, how do you define "... anything given to you by the
guild"?   I only ask because a couple of the uber guilds on our server
have some pretty draconian rules about loot.  If you go on a raid with
them and you get some uber item, you're free to use it. But it's not
really "yours". Should you upgrade, it goes back to the guild leader.
And even more shockingly, should you have the bad taste to actually
*leave* the guild, every single piece of gear you've received on raids
is supposed to be given back.
  So, are you talking about a new member coming in, you notice that they
have a crappy breastplate and you *give* them an uber one out of some
guild bank account? Or are you referring to stuff they loot, win the
roll on, etc. on a raid to a higher end zone?
