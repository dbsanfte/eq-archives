    So you PLed. Congrats. Now create a REAL AoE group at level 24. :-) It
is doable, I've seen them out in Marus Seru (and they're fun to watch). But
it isn't much of an option - the enchanters have only two AoE stuns to
alternate, the PBAoE spells available aren't so hot.... Most groups I've
seen do it out there end up using junk spells, too, like the shaman poison
rain, because they have to recruit classes like shaman to get SoW to pull.
