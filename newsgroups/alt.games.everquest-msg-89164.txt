Well, two things.

1.  You asked a question that has been answered many times, recently, and
you could have found your answer just by browsing the newsgroup.

2.  You did not quote in your reply.  News propagation can get very spotty,
and some news servers have a very short retention time for messages, so the
post you are replying to may be gone, or never have reached some of the
people ready your reply.  If all they see is your reply, they have no
context to know what you are responding to.
