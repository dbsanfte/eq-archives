Looking at it right now.  Have you?  It looks like it always has since the
first time I looked at it.  Lotsa garbage characters, as one would expect
from a binary file, with guild names in plain text and easy to pick out.  A
few get garbled, but most are clearly legible (and for counting purposes the
rest are probably good enough).

And apparently there is a guild on my server named "Asimov"...

Is that the full guildname?  I'll be glad to pop on and try.  :)

A guild named...  hell, I forget the name...  anyway, the guildleader went
MIA and the officers left for other guilds but the guild itself was still
healthy (in their own way), but couldn't invite anyone.  Their solution was
to get the name "_Guild Name_" for a new guild.

It shows up as "< Guild Name >" instead of "<Guild Name>"  To do a /who on
them, though, you have to do /who "_Guild Name_".

Also, some interesting little humor.  I'm not sure if this is game wide or
only on one server, or even still done as I haven't checked in a long time,
but try "/who dipshit all" and "/who dumbass all" and "/who KSer all" and
stuff like that and you might be surprised at what comes up.  :)
