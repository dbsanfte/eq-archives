I'd have to disagree pretty strongly.  I was not referring to the 
graphics, or the UI, more to the very strong drift from the original 
"vision".  The game has changed pretty significantly in that regard.  
Call me a masochist, but, I actually liked it back when you did have to 
take the boats or find a porter to get to places.  Back when there were 
no soulbinders, and it actually took a little bit of effort to get to 
level 10.  In many ways it is not anything like what it used to be, many 
say it's better because of those exact changes, but, not all of us.
