Like everyone else, I'm experiencing the slow zoning times in many
zones, and I'm trying to figure out what is causing it. Why am I
trying to figure it out? Because I'm tired of programming for the
night, that's why :)

As I see it, two main things happen when you zone...

1) The server sends you information about who is in the new zone,
their locations, etc. Includes PCs and NPCs.

2) Your machine loads up the appropriate graphics for the new zone.

Item 1 should have remained constant from pre- to post-SoL. That
leaves item 2.

The graphics for the new zone, though, are on the local machine. Yes,
they're bigger (anyone know what the actual resolution increase was
for an individual texture component?), but are they so much bigger as
to cause the delay we're seeing, and the rather large memory
requirement jump?

We know we're using a new graphics engine, but since we didn't get a
completely new set of zone maps, we can assume the format of the local
zone files didn't change.

My best guess based on all this is that what's happening during zoning
is that the zone maps are actually being translated from the pre- to
post-SoL format. This would be a very CPU (and time) intensive
operation, and would also require a good chunk of RAM. The only thing
that doesn't fit, though, is that not *all* zoning takes a long time.

Of course, if I'm right, it kind of begs the question of why wasn't
the graphic engine (which was licensed from a third party) modified to
use the original file format natively?


Ok, enough of that, back to programming I go.
