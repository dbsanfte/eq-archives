Ronin is made up of two characters: "wandering" and "person".

The "unemployed" aspect of it is a relatively recent additional
meaning.  Students who fail their college entrance exam and spend a
year studying to pass next year's exam are called "Roninsei", or
"lordless students" if you will.


Samurai is a single character word, but the character is made up of 2
radicals meaning "temple" and "person".
