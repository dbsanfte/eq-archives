While I have read bits and pieces of Title 17 ("Title"), I don't generally
find legalese to be enjoyable reading.  I highly suggest going to the law
journals and reading some interpretations by law professors, or better yet,
the extensive books on the subject written by same.  Still very dry, but at
least in "english", complete with case citations supporting those
interpretations (i.e., what judges *actually* decide, rather than your own
pie-in-the-sky interpretation).

I'll recommend a few for you.  All are available through Westlaw or Lexis or
their respective publishers, and possibly at your local law school and/or
bar library.

Copyright by Paul Goldstein (Stanford Law Professor) (Aspen, 1996)
Copyright Registration Practice by James Hawes (West, 1999)
Nimmer on Copyright by Melville B. Nimmer (1976)
Code : and other laws of cyberspace by Lawrence Lessig (Basic Books, 1999)
Research in Copyright Law by Jonathan Franklin (Associate Law Librarian,
University of Washington School of Law) (2003)

I highly suggest the Nimmer and Hawes publications for a truly in depth
explanation of copyright law.  Find the Franklin work if you're looking for
a quick primer (and you should be).

Ever see what happens to anyone who tries to *sell* a non-Disney drawing of
Mickey?  Might I suggest some more interesting reading:

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/156097530X/104-4980982-3115109
?v=glance

(Link broken for length, I assume you can fix it)

You may particularly find the discussion of lower court decisions
interesting.  Hint, Disney didn't win at every stage (I admit it, I borrowed
this book from my Mom, who has an admittedly odd taste in books, but it's
quite ironically amusing that you used Mickey as an example).

Amusing.  =)  I'll pick...  You are wrong for suggesting that other thing.
=P

As you educate yourself, I'll go ahead and give you an opinion on a
tangential subject.  The "Boner" (Bono) law is destined to be overturned.
