}Bizbee allegedly scribed:
}> Oh shut the fuck up. Oh, and work on finishing school. Oh, and go back
}> to Diablo if you don't like it. No one gives a fuck what you want.
}You getting a bit soft in your old age aren't you Bizbee? The first thing I
}thought after reading him was:
}"Please develop testicular cancer, and may it cause a huge swelling in your
}throat where it is most obvious that your testicle reside. May it continue
}growing, swelling and pressing in against your airways until eventually
}bursting internally and dumping litres of fluid into your trachea, down into
}your lungs. May your last breath be spent choking on your own puss, blood
}and and testicular fluid. Bascially: die fucktard, horribly.
}Oh - and I mean that in the nicest possible way."

Ohh... I was wondering where the real Bizbee went... so now, where'd the 
real Rastus go?
