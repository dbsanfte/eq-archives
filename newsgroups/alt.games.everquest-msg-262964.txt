I'm not sure this can be prevented, but FV made a stab at it, so lets 
see if we can do so too.  How about putting TLC in place here too, 
and/or the one character per account plan.

Now I'll admit that TLC can be very annoying, and on FV its also easily 
evaded; just get at least one other person to help out, go into raid 
mode, and the code restriction is gone.  Since that other person can be 
on in the bazaar or whatever, there's no real penalty other than a mild 
nuisance and a need for friends.

And two boxing eliminates the need for friends and to some extent 
elminates the one character per account part of the plan...

But FV demonstrates that for the vast majority, these two restrictions 
do work; most people don't two box and even if they do, that only 
creates a limited amount of alts (to be precise, one per additional 
account) so you still see a lot less twinking.

I'd also think you'd see a lot less farming even without TLC on an "all 
no drop" server, simply because even if you do figure out a way to sell 
your product (selling loot rights comes to mind) the question is, what 
good is the money you make?

You end up having to trade loot rights for loot rights (perhaps selling 
for pp and then spending pp on other rights) which seems to me means you 
might as well have just gone over to what you really wanted and camped that.

Well, my original plan was to have any item flagged as trade skill 
usable and any trade skill product be droppable.

I'm none too sure I wouldn't prefer to just make everything no drop, 
though; elminate loopholes and to hell with tradeskilling and the bazaar 
both.  I bet 90% of the people doing tradeskills on most severs are 
doing so strictly to use the skills for some of the quests, anyway.

Trouble is, some components are forage only.  And many drop off very low 
level mobs; everything no drop and TLC combine to make some combinations 
impossible... unless of course trade skill items aren't magic or lore; 
the TLC doesn't stop regular items from dropping, just flagged ones.

Well A) yeah, make those items tributable.  I'm irritated, actually, 
that any no drop items aren't tributable.  I suppose it makes sense from 
an RP standpoint, if you assume tribute is going to be recycled by the 
priesthood.  But from a gameplay standpoint it sucks.  And if you really 
believe tribute is going to the Gods, then a little thing like a No Drop 
tag shouldn't stop them from appreciating your sacrifice.

But B), if something drops you can't use, just destroy it, it doesn't 
have to clog up your inventory.  If your party gets no drop items it 
can't use now, what happens to them?  Grats Rot.

Maybe we should call the whole server Grats Rot
