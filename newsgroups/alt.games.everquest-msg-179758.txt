"> the russians stopped the germans in WWII, not the Americans
>
Only on the Russian front, they had nothing to do with the rest of Europe "


1.    The Russians were supplied by the western allies, i.e. US & UK
(remember the Murmansk run?).

2.    Many people believe that Stalingrad was the turning point of the war,
so the Russians had a major impact on the whole of the European war.


Many books, nay tomes, have been written on this subject by genuine experts
and it is perhaps arrogant of any of us to think we are able to give the
ultimate answer in a couple of sentences.  Invective and foul language are
even more demeaning.  Even passionate feelings can be expressed without
swearing/blasphemy -- the English language is rich enough for that.
