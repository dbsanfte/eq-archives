More than that, in fact. I have an Athlon 2000+ (1600Mhz real speed), 
768MB RAM, and I replaced my GeForce 4 4200 128 with a Radeon 9800 Pro 
128, which is technically much faster. Well, I noticed SFA of a 
difference. The older games were already running as fast as they would 
go, and Everquest appears to be CPU limited as well. I still average 
around 10-15 fps in the Plane of Knowledge.
