Christ.

The American southwest is being overrun by illegal immigrants.  How does
that make the US an empire?  We dont even force them to learn, much less
speak, English or deny them schooling or healthcare.

As for siezing land from American Indians?  Uh, if that qualifies the US
as an empire than any currently ruling people that hold land once held
by another people would also be empires.  So, no that doesnt make the US
an empire as that would make the definition of empire overly broad.

The Civil War is your only marginally applicable point, but that was
decided almost 150 years ago...
