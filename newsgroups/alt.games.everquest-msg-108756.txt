He must have only survived one or two fights to the end then.  I'm currently
max CoV, and have been for months.  I've lost it three times, once when we
killed Klandicar, once when we killed Sontalak, and once when we were toying
with the idea of switching the majority of the guild over to giant faction.

On each single kill of dragons in West Wastes, one faction hit has dropped me
to Warmly.  By the end of one raid that was killing for talismans and armor, I
was down to indifferent.   By the end of a second, I was one kill into "Scowls
at you ready to attack."

The ride down is a lot faster than the ride up.
