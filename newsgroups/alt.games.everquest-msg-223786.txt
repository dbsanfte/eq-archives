Yes, possibly. I'm completely lost, though. It's not like riding a 
bicycle at all. And on the last computer rebuild, all my customized EQ 
files were wiped. I spent too long on that stupid SWG interface, and 
it's baby steps in EQ for now until I can figure out what I'm doing 
again. My 61 wizard is currently more like a chimpanzee with a flamethrower.
