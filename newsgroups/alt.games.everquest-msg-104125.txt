Up to about level 50 I had no trouble grouping my druid, and he worked
just fine as a healer or nuker, and provided some crowd control.  Post
50 it's pretty hard for a druid to get a pickup group, but if you have
a decent guild you shouldn't have any problem.

Yeah, enchanters are a VERY interesting class.  Even at a low level,
my enchanter has to make some hard decisions about what spells to mem.
 I've been very impressed with the skill level of the enchanters I've
played with at higher levels.  Main problem is getting past the low
levels where people can be pretty clueless about how to play with you,
but once you get to the high levels, you will always be in demand,
particularly for dungeon crawls.
