So far (I've been playing since mid-beta), it's an absolute blast.

> Worth checking out?
Definitely (see above)

So far, it's not as complex... like any good game, it's easy to understand,
difficult to master.  There is no "gear" or loot, but there are a plethora
of powers and strategies to use them.  Strategies are endless, and any good
group must adapt based on the mobs they're fighting, and what kind of group
they have.

> Doubtful, but will it steal me away from EQ?
It's entirely possible... CoH came along at at a time when I felt EQ was
becoming too much like work and not enough like a game.  I still have my EQ
account, but haven't logged on in a month, and I can't say I feel like I'm
missing anything.  And for what it's worth, 95% of my supergroup (guild) is
made up of former EQers who were "stolen away".  It is not EQ and if you
expect it to be, you will be sorely dissapointed.  But if you look at it
with fresh eyes, it's a solid game with a lot of potential.
