What could it possibly hurt?  Its not much, but its damage done to the mob if you
are being beat on.  Its never going to break mez (you don't get hit by a mob thats
mezed) its never going to get you beat on (the mob only takes damage if its
already beating on you) its not going to put you higher on the hate list (DS
damage is unattributed, no hate added)

This would be a real, very serious, objection.  Particularly, spectacularly, so on
a PvP server.  Look, flying wizard.  Lets see if we can kill him with a spell that
costs a bat wing!
