\> Ever seen anyone get upset by people referring to breeze/clarity as
> crack?

Yep. But then I also see people get upset about so many other things that I
first examine why they say they are upset and judge it on its merits. The
roots of cocaine go very deep in s america where the leaves of the plant
where chewed by inca warriors. It caused them to feel no pain, need no sleep
, and be able to pay attention for long periods of time. Gave them an extra
dose of ferocity as well, something most usefull when fighting for your
life.

Clarity really only reduces downtime so should really be referred to as
speed , juice , wire sauce or something sililiar to convey the proper
analogy.

If you are upset that a causal refrence in everyday conversation brought
back childhood traumas and you feel all upset and victimized I would ask
that you get over it . If you have friends that use such refrences routinely
you might inform them that you are especially touchy about chemicals used
for recreation that can have serious deleterious side effects, and to try
and keep such refrences to a minimum.
