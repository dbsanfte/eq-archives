I needed this the other day when grouped, but even when soloing I think I
should know how to tell people what loot is on the MOB I/we just killed.
I type: Rusty Short Sword
It is just text, but when other people say they are selling/found a Rusty
Short Sword it is an in-game link that when clicked on it tells me all about
the loot.

What are they doing different so it is not plain text?

TIA
