    Velious faction, the last time that faction really made a difference at
the guild level, is an example of faction done right. Choice of hunting
grounds is dictated by faction if one wants to make use of all the drops
available (Thurg quested drops in Kael, WToV and HoT armour drops). The
guild that goes nuts and kills everything indiscriminately loses out on the
quests, which have very good rewards. Even the gnoll-othmir-ulthork faction
triangle has some useful associated quests and drops, forcing someone to
decide whether to be pro- or anti-othmir.

    Compare that with Luclin, or Kunark (PoP doesn't really have any
factions). In Kunark, the evil side lost a ton of hunting grounds by keeping
Outpost faction and got almost nothing for it. In Luclin, the two major
factions had very little in the way of useful quests and didn't really have
many raid-worthy targets (Lcea and Nathyn, Lord Seru). So there wasn't much
reason to care about any of them. And the lesser sub-factions are just as
ignorable, most being one-way only. Why there's three factions in Ssra, when
you start out scowls KOS and nothing raises the faction, is beyond me.
