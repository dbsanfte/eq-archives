Yes. If the situation has truely gotten desperate and zoning is not an
option. Sometimes the adds come too many and too soon and mana is getting
dangerously low. If there's still 3+ mobs remaining above the one the
tanks are beating down, -and- I'm very low mana (about 1 bub is when I
start considering it) I'll charm. I'll try to pick the lowest conning mob
to minimize the chance for an early charm break. A blue mob is going to
hit as hard or harder than any single tank in your group - even if the
charm only lasts a minute thats 1 minute I'm medding and 1 minute of
serious damage output. Consider all the damage the charmed mob does as
damage your tanks would have otherwise taken.

I rarely move during a fight unless I'm having trouble targeting. Running
around serves -no- purpose and I get pissed every time I see the wizzys do
it. (get it off me get it off me!) It's SO annoying.  I absolutely HATE
the idiot casters I see panic and run amok when a mob agros on them. Seems
to happen a lot with wizzys but it always annoys me. Not only are you
making it next to impossible for the tanks to taunt it off you, you're
making it damned hard for anyone to even target the beast in the first
place.

I charm solo a lot, charm breaks aren't actually anything to worry about.
There's no need to worry about something that is GUARANTEED to happen.
There is no "if charm breaks". So go into a charm situation planning for
it to happen. The secret to charm (and no, I didn't discover it myself,
but it certainly works)

After you've sic'd the pet on a mob, press F1 twice. That targets your
charmed pet. Sit to med. Your mouse cursor should be on your charm spell
or root spell, depending upon how far away from the charmed mob you can
get. In tighter quarters, position the cursor over your longest lasting
color stun. Position your hand on the keyboard hovering over the CTRL-S
combination. (Stands up but doesn't remove your target like ESC does)

When (not if!) charm breaks, hit CTRL-S, followed immediately by a click
on the spell you had prepped. If you were outside regular spell range you
can immediately re-charm the mob (they're already Tash'd, right??). If you
were too close to get a spell off before the mob is on top of you and has
a chance to interrupt you, then stun and re-charm. It sounds complex but
it's actually quite simple once you've practiced it a few times. There is
a high degree of danger, yes. As an enchanter however, you should have
LONG ego learned how to keep your cool when the mobs come after you.

I've had more than one charmed mob pretty much turn the tide of battle,
with not a whole lot of extra risk.
