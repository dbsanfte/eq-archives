Go to astalavista.sk and look at all the keygenerators. Each of those
represents yet another "encryption scheme" which failed to a hacker's attack.

No, let's not face it. That is as valid as if I said "99% of all hacked
passwords are a result of the company giving them out to employees." I have no
factual basis for that statement, and you have none for yours.
