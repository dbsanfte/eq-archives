At level 51 I had:

Same 2 stuns
Root (always)  BTW, screw max root time, pick the one that casts the
fastest...THAT one is the one that will save your life.
Dazzle (don't see much point in having the level 4 one too)
SLOW   No matter what I have this one up.  There are very few shaman as fast
as me when it comes to slowing stuff, and Slow saves more lives over time
than Mez.:p

That's 4

I usually had Tash and a nuke up, making 6 spells.  If 3+ pulls were a real
danger I'd swap nuke with it.  Most of the time with just 3 or 4 I'd Dazzle
'em all and trust my healer to keep my butt alive.

7 would be clarity
8...hmmm...I forget.  I wouldn't bother with a debuff though...they don't
seem to affect critters much.

At level 61:
Root (Fetter)
Boggle (hate reducer) or Theft of Thought
Arcane Rune (free 1500hp damage absorber self-buff)
Dazzle (switched to Glamour of Kintaz if necessary...switched with Apathy if
absolutely necessary)
SLOW!!
Nuke or Dazzle (if I had to take it out above but there's still a use for
long-term mezzing)
Haste/GRM (swap)
Tash (usually...not a big priority most of the time) or mana stealer (ToT,
Wandering Mind)

I'll swap out a couple for the 2 stuns I used to use all the time, but
there's too much stuff no longer affected by stuns for me to keep them up
all the time.
