    Casting Reinforcement is one of the archetype skills available when
doing alt XP. At level one, two and three it extends the duration of buffs
cast by you 5%, 15%, and 30% over base duration. I liked it because it was
the prerequisite for the 50% extension class-level skill, and because it
scales - every alt. XP point you put into these skills extends your buff
duration by 2.5%, unlike Mental Clarity (1 point of extra mana regen per
level of Mental Clarity) which has diminishing returns.

    (The levels cost two points, then four points, then six points to
purchase. So level 3 in Casting Reinforcement costs 12 total points.)

    Well, turns out this skill was broken when released. What everyone else
thought it did was extend the duration of buffs you cast on yourself by
whatever the percentage is, but only buffs you cast on yourself. So it
didn't extend my buffs on others, which is the big reason to have it. So I
stopped putting points into it, which Dan knew about. I was about to start
again, though (which Dan didn't know about), because I found from testing
that they'd made a very simple mistake.

    It didn't extend buffs you cast, it extended buffs cast on you. All of
them.

    Once I noticed that my Gift of Pure Thought wasn't even close to fading
when everyone else was complaining theirs had dropped (it's a group Clarity
II spell), I timed it. Sure enough, 5% added duration. Having buffs on me
last longer is not only useful for times after a group splits up, when you
want to milk Clarity for every last point of mana, but also when grouping
with bards. I was HOPING that once I got to level three that bard songs
would last last for an extra tick or two, which can make a big difference
when the bard stops playing mana song or runs out of range. Guess I'll never
find out, now.

    James
