I've only been playing for about 15 months, and I do see myself playing if
for another year or so anyway.  Not too sure about 2 years, so I'll probably
just go with the one year extension.  I can only find the time to devote to
one of these games at a time, and, frankly, Star Wars just doesn't grab me
as an idea for a MMORPG.  Who knows, maybe I'll change my mind.
