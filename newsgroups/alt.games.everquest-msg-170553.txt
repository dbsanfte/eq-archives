Its one of the parts of the Protection of the Cabbage quest which yeilds the
Solstice Earring (FT 1 earring with nice stats) and for druids, another earring
(nicer stats, clicky port to DL ring... but no FT)

As such, I suspect its selling for more PP than a comperable weapon which isn't
normally used for some other purpose

However, I could certainly be wrong on this.  I -think- I recall it being a
"magic item" weapon, but can't say one way or the other.  Mine was in my hands
for all of a minute before I shoved it into a forge along with its 8 brother
items-of-weirdness and hit combine... and since its not a blunt instrument,
using it to beat something's head in in the interim never entered even my melee
oriented clerical brain.
