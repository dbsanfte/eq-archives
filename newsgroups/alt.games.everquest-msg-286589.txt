Sigh, I've been avoiding getting involved in this flame-fest, and
by all sanity should probably continue to stay out of it, but I'm
getting really tired of the Rat saying the same crap over and over.

I don't know if the Rat really has any direct experience with
software development practices, but I do.  I've been a professional
software developer for over 30 years.  I know EXACTLY how EASY it
is for even a good QA team to overlook problems that are glaringly
obvious once someone points them out.  (And I'm not claiming SOE's
QA team is anywhere near "good".)

Now, I'll grant that the tale of Bards Who Can't Sing is impressive.
If it really was the case that no bard could sing any song at all,
and they missed it, that's hard to explain short of "all we're making
is a trivial change, no need to test much", which is shabby practice
at best.  But this AA thing?  Sure, I'll bet they had someone try it
out.  That person probably took one or more characters with lots of
AAs (perhaps via testbuffing) and checked out the UI in the new AA
window, maybe even buying some AAs, verifying the AAs were displayed
right, whatever.  Everything I've seen posted here seems to indicate
that the bugs had to do with the AAs not having the effects they're
supposed to.  That is NOT going to be "obvious" to someone who's just
checking whether the AA window shows the AAs to be present.  And if
existing AA hotkeys stopped working, but new hotkeys worked, I could
see that getting overlooked in testing also.  Shabby practice again,
but easy to overlook.

I'll well believe that they didn't take any characters with lots of
AAs and run them around to check if the AAs were working.  Even if
they had, I don't think everyone is as good as the Rat at noticing
that they're not getting the expected 30% bonus to critical hit
chances, or whatever else the AAs were supposed to do.  Indeed, given
how hard it is to test each individual AA, I could easily believe that
the AAs themselves were not tested much if at all.  But that's a FAR
CRY from "no testing".  I'm sure they tested the UI itself.  All that
some of us are trying to say is that screaming "SOE never does any
testing at all" is an obvious hyperbole that weakens your argument.

Now if you just want to bitch about all the bugs that they overlooked
during their testing, fine.  If you want to bitch about bugs that you
know were reported by players on the Test server (especially if you
know because you reported them yourself) and that got left in when the
code went live, fine.  We've all seen examples of this, and we all
agree that SOE's QA process is crappy.  I'm willing to speculate that
they don't have much if any instrumentation to enable automatic
testing; for instance, no, they probably CAN'T get into a combat and
then look at a log to verify things like critical hits.  I'll bet they
just log into the game and try some things, sure with extra abilities
like testbuffing or invulnerability or whatever so they can set up
specific tests when appropriate, but it's probably NOT automated and
they can't possibly manually test ALL the features.

The sad truth is that when you have hundreds of thousands of users,
those users are going to do a MUCH better job of finding the bugs than
any QA team.  So you test some stuff and then hope for the best.  No,
it's not good practice, and they could certainly do a better job even
with the resources they do have, but I'm sure they do SOME testing.
