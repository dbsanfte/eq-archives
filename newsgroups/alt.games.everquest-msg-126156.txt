My answer is based on my experience only, after playing 3 characters 50+ for
over 3 years.  Take it as you will.

No, spell level is not involved at all in the instance you're talking about.
There are some spells that won't stick on critters because of their level,
but in these instances you're talking about certain high level encounters
with mezz & charm...something you won't have to worry about for a while yet.
