On second screening, yes :)

*grumble* MY small groups' bard decided to pull in Velk last night. He
got at least three spiders, charmed one, shouted for me to heal him
and then I got 5 spiders on me. He blamed the overpull on the
shattering hammers he'd just gotten from a 60 paladin, proceeded to
try to drag my corpse to village to look for a rez and managed to fall
into the hollow area above the Pit. The paladin (friend of mine) tried
to help, fell in as well, and ended up rezing me himself (not exactly
preferable post-54, but better than staying undinged and corpseless).

At least I got to see the surroundings of the Pit - I've never gotten
a group there :)
