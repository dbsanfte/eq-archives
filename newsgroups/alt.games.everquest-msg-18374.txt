YES YES YES!!!

They are still EXTREMELY popular among thousands of people!  Go to
rec.arts.int-fiction for info about writing text adventures (the new name is
interactive fiction or IF) or rec.games.int-fiction for info on playing games. 
There is a huge community of authors who write games.  I have even written two
small ones and am working on a third which will be larger.  Zork and all the
other infocom games are still popular among IF enthusiasts, but there are some
really great games being written today.  I REALLY strongly recommend you
download a game called Photopia, by Adam Cadre.  IF today is more literary
today than it was before.  It still has great puzzles though (although Photopia
really doesn't have any).
