there is currently no way to list all of the channels available. Word of
mouth is the only way to find them...or you could guess.

to join a serverwide channel, type /join serverwide.channelname:password
(if there is a password)
if it's a chat channel on your home server, type /join
channelname:password

not all channels have passwords, and often, if it's a public channel, the
password will simply be the name of the channel
