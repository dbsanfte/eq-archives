As a cleric, I still routinely use not level II spells, but level I spells!
Flash of Light, Root, Stun, are most of the time the best spells of those lines,
despite the fact that I have a level II blind, something on the order of 5 roots
(and still missing two that would require focus IV!) and 7 stuns (including at
least one level IV one I have in book, and I think another coming)

The thing is, the reason these spells are the best is because they are very
cheap... so any mana savings from focus effects would be pretty imperceptable,
and fast... so spell haste isn't going to work.  Any damage these spells do
(none in my case) is very low as well, incedental to the effect you were going
for, and tends to be very inefficient compared to your higher level spells, so
upgrade to damage isn't really helpful.  The only effects that might be
interesting are extended duration (duration tends to be one of the tradeoffs you
are making by picking lower level spells) and extended range... this last is so
helpful that despite the fact that most of my "real" spells are level IV now, I
still keep a Supple Scale Armband equipped so my root/stun/flash spells can be
used on mobs just a little further away.
