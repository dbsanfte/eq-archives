I like this type.  That information is helpful (is this how people found
some of the stuff like calculation methods listed on the web sites most of
us use?  Or were those things, like skills, amount of mana, released by
Verant?).

EBayers...not the buyers...the sellers.
The k3wl d00dz who use it for this purpose, as you said, likely won't have
it more than a version or two.

ShowEQ allows you to check a mob without being in that zone?  Is that what
you're saying?

Really it only takes 2 players, or 1 player in 2 locations to figure this.
Verant gives the tools, your math teacher gave you the knowledge.  Locate
corpse to find the direction it is in, walk towards it checking /loc, do
this from at least 2 locations (maybe a 3rd for verification), compare the
locs, and get the coordinates.  Shouldn't be too hard to just write a
program to do this (just drawing lines on a graph and seeing where they
intersect).

That example can be considered cheating though.  Same with #3, since
technically that is an added advantage that effects game play rather than
just seeing stats or helping someone (with a method where as I pointed out
the information can be obtained in another way).

Arguable on this one.  EQAtlas and /loc work as well.  So a more advanced
version here.  Again something someone could right up, and maybe even do
some kind of Java based website for.

Arguable, possibly more on the cheating side, as this was meant to be done
by trial & error method.

Could this be where the original idea started?  I hope Verant does use their
own version that THEY wrote, not waiting on this one (which would be funny
if that was the reason they haven't killed it).
    I do remember seeing ShowEQ in full hardware form on EBay about 2 years
ago (link was posted here).  You only needed to plug in a keyboard &
monitor, preferably also mouse, and rout your modem's phone line through it.
I'd bet this version was broke pretty quick though, as non-upgradeable?  Or
did someone get it and re-write their own version?
