Idiots are a universal thing, some drive Porches others run "uber" Guilds
being succesfull, ambitious or a geek (whatever) does not necessarily make
you a nice person.
If you mean they can't play the game, then it's possible they bought the
account, I 'spose.

Unlikely anyone got into EQ server side and could do much when there, maybe
a hacker could bring a server down but not likely retrieve any useful data
from one.
Hackers in EQ are more likely to access a client, you wouldn't want to see
the amount of Sub Seven port probes I get in a night and most of these are
not "real" hackers but someone with the software to do it, they could at
least try to mask their IP address, oh well.

Why not, being "lame" doesn't mean you're not intelligent or talented in
someway.

You want to see "l33t" idiots play, wait for Neocron (or just play Counter
Strike now)

So is Raikkonen the next Hakkinen or do you still think Mika has another
