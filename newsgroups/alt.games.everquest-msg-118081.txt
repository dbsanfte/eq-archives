I gush about it, whenever anyone posts a question to this group :-)

I haven't played (or even logged into) my old server in over a month
now. My only complaint about FV is the zone-wide Shout and Auction. It
is not nearly as bad as a regular server, but I still see 1-2 "d00ds"
and idiots disturbing popular zones each night (I travel a lot, and
hit maybe 5-8 zones a night).

I do have the luxury of running two accounts. I own 4 accounts total,
but have cancelled two of them, (It's a long story, but none of the
accounts were purchased, and none will ever be sold.), so I am not as
restricted as most with the 1 character rule.
