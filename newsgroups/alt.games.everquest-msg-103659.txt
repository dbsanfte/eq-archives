Does Copelands take into account the different caps on weapons skills?
When I put thru Shadowheart (11/17 Poker) in primary and a 
Swiftblade of Zek (11/18) in offhand I get higher DPM than with them the other
way, even though Piercing will cap at 240 I think it is.  The dmg output
is antecdotally different (I haven't actually parsed fights with 'em)
and does tilt significantly to keeping the poker in mainhand.  I was
very surprised that a differnce of 1 in the delay could make that large
a difference however.
