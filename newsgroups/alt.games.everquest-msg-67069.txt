  I don't really see how a lawsuit is in order.  What is the suggested
retail price of Luclin?  Does it say on the box?  Maybe Circuit City
and Best Buy were just running a sale.  Though it is a bit ironic.
You pay more to pre-order, then can't even play the first day due to
the clogged patch server, and when you do get in, you find that for
the first week the game is too buggy and resource intensive to
tolerate.

  Just save your experience for future reference and never pre-order a
Verant product again.
