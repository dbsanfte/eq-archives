I've said it many times.  Our regular group had a druid as the main healer.
Who was the best healer I ever played with.  I'd add that druid before
Cleric_01 any day of the week.

There are no classses who bring nothing to a group at high levels.
Generally, the more soloable a class is, the more they "seem" to not be
needed for groups.  Not because they're not needed, but because they
generally aren't motivated enough to keep trying.  A druid or necromancer
that can't find a group is likely to just say "Nobody wants me in a group,
screw it, I'm going to solo."  A warrior or rogue that can't find a group
sits around and continues to LFG until he gets one.   Because he has no
other choice.

Theres also somewhat of a bias against the soloist classes.   People
occasionally do not want them, no matter what they would add to the group,
due to prior bad experiences with soloists who never grouped until high
levels, and just plain don't know what to do once they begin to group.
