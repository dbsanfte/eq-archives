Spare me the condescending tone, if you will. I know how game developers

Precisely, my problem is with the people who fail to make that distinction, 
and affirm that Verant are a bunch of incompetents, when we're actually 
talking of a small segment of the company who may, on ocassion, become 
overwhelmed by a particularly broken patch.

No other MMORPG is quite as complex or as big as EQ. We don't know for a 
fact that's even *possible* to do things better, CS-wise, because nobody 
has.

Do I get frustrated when some bug that ought to be obvious gets past their 
testing? Yes. Do I believe that this will continue to happen, no matter how 
many people or how many hours they throw at testing every patch? Yes.
