My nephew bought a hot new computer a few weeks ago, and it
was running EQ very smoothly, until one day he went to log in
and everything was VERY choppy.  His Rogue got killed in Oasis
because the framerate was so bad running from a mob was like
trying to swim in molasses.  And every other zone he tried
had the same problem.

So I had him check various things, try with and without UseUmbra
line, blah blah blah...

What finally fixed him up was using the Windows Task Manager
(reach it through Ctrl-Alt-Del) and nuking every task that was
running in the background (except Explorer, of course, and
maybe Systray) before launching EQ.

By a process of elimination he found the culprit.
It turned out that between the day(s) he ran fine and the
day it suddenly turned to sludge, he had installed an MP3
player/retriever software product, and it had installed
some sort of "always running, even after a reboot" component
that was playing hell with EQ.  Once he knocked it out,
EQ was beautiful again.

Note:  On Windows 98/Me there's only one Task Manager
screen, but on Windows 2000/NT/XP there are two pages
to the task manager, make sure you go through the Processes
tab as well and clean out anything that looks suspicious
(but not *too* much, because the Processes tab includes
a lot of Windows kernel processes that you can't do without).
My nephew's troublesome application only showed up on the
Processes tab, because it didn't have an interface window
(only processes with a "main window" interface show up
on the "Applications" list).

That's the first thing I'd check on computers that *ought*
to be powerful enough to run EQ smoothly, but are running
like dogs.

If I can run well on a 400MhZ Celeron, all you folks with
far faster computers (and better video boards) ought to
have no stutter at all.  If you do, it's time to hunt
around for what's wrong.
