I would imagine they are KOS where all the other Good/Neutral Races are KOS.
These being Grobb, Neriak, Cabillis, and I think one other.  Humans WILL
however not be very liked in some of the other cities. I imagine they won't get
very good prices in Felwithe, Erudine, Misty Thicket, Kaladim, or Kelethin, the
Barbarian city, etc..  
    However, Freeport is THE human city and is a nice city at that.  Also not a
bad base of operations being the HUB of Antonica so to speak.  

     Granted, I'm just guessing from my personal experiences with my character,
a  Neutral Dwarf.  But then again, If your Agnostic or a worshipper of a
different god all these are factors that could change how your percieved in
another town.  Can Humans worship Tunare? If they could I bet they recieve a
better welcome in Kelethin. At least at the Cleric and Paladin guild.
