I think there's a big difference between those warriors who are in
successful, well-populated guilds and warriors who have to rely on random
pick-up groups in the general population (ok, call me Captain Obvious).
Neither my warrior friend nor I is guilded and so we depend entirely on
finding those random pickup groups via /shout or the LFG tool. I don't have
any trouble getting invited to groups; most nights I have two-to-three
offers pending and have to choose one.

My friend, on the other hand, has a lot more trouble getting chosen for
groups even though he is a very good player. If we were both in an active
guild with many well-known guildmates I suspect that both of us would be
similarly situated in terms of group invites. But in the more detached world
of pickup groups looking for key classes to fill out an LDoN group, for
example, where the search is often explicitly for Healing, DPS, CC and
tanking, I've noticed that if there's a choice between a Warrior and a
Paladin, all other things being equal, the Paladin will almost always be
favored because of the efficiency of his CC and tanking. My friend says that
Paladins at his level are also better at holding aggro and if that's true,
Warrior would be the only class I know of where a defining ability of the
class is actually done better by some other class.

This guy isn't a whiner. He's a straight-up, ambitious achiever and he's
been sucking it up and plowing forward with his character (he's not
attending the stand-down). But I've seen enough of his experience to know
that if we weren't working on advancement together right now, he'd be
re-rolling.

I'm sure you're right that plans for this have likely been in gestation for
some time now and are not a reaction to the stand-down, although the
announcement may be. But it's good timing in any case and I welcome the
upgrade for my warrior buddies everywhere.
