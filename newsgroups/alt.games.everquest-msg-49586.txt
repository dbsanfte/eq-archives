I left AO in a week, and that is including the two days I spent with
technical problems before I could actually play it.

You are right when you say it is too early to tell if DAoC is a good game or
not.  But there are a couple of things which it is NOT too early to tell:

First, it has had a remarkable... no an impeckable launch.  There *aren't*
any startup problems to speak of.  I mean there have been less technical
problems with the launch of this game than with the vast majority of single
player games.  Those of us who have been with EQ since the beginning
remember that EQ's launch was pretty much a disaster (overshadowed by such
games as AO, but still a disaster), and those of us who played a rogue in
the beginning can vouch that it was over a year before all the character
classes had all of their skills (the ones that were listed and we were able
to spend points on) implemented.  The launch of DAoC IS a landmark
achievement in the MMORPG world.

Second, great care and attention to detail has been put into its design.
Those of you us who played/play AC and AO know that those two games, even
after they are up and running have/had lag issues, memory leaks, and/or odd
graphical and/or game play anomalies that regularly pop up.  DAoC doesn't
have any of that.  It is smooth, beautiful, virtually lag free even with
hundreds of players in the vacinity.

Third its interface and game play mechanics are wonderful.  I started to
write a paragraph to describe some of these interface elements, but the
paragraph became very long so I deleted it.  Suffice it to say that the
system of user-input to the game is the best to date.

Now, let me re-iterate.  I am NOT bashing EQ.  I still subscribe to EQ and
will probably abandon DAoC for a while when Luclin comes out.  I am NOT
arguing that DAoC may loose some of its initial popularity.  I don't think
so, but you are right when you say it is too early to tell.  You are very
wise, much more-so than I, for waiting a while before trying this game.
Myself, I'm impatient and I run out and buy any game that looks like I might
enjoy it before I get a chance to read any comments or press.  I commend you
for practicality.

I AM saying that it is not right to compare DAoC to that turd AO.  I mean it
is not too early to tell that these two games should not be compared to one
another.  AO was a horrible excercise in frustration and was just an all
around bad release by any standard.  They had some good ideas but.... nuff
said.  If everybody quit DAoC tomorrow it would still go down as a landmark
achievement and held as an example of how an MMOG SHOULD be launched.

I'll tell you more as I learn more.

Best Regards
