Very nice writeup here :)

i would just like to add one thing: KEI, most love it, too many can't
play without it.

learn to play without it, there will be times when you can't get your
damn crack, and it will also make you a lot more aware of mana
management, which is your most important skill.

i know it's nice to have unlimited mana at lvl 20, but you'll be a
better cleric, overall, if you learn to play without KEI...even if you
use kei some of the time, then do one in five groups without kei(or
something)
