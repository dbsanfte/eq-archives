Because with a low-end computer and a low-end connection, which
I'm forced to endure sometimes, there is a huge difference to me playing
with 1500 people on server and 2500.  I honestly  can use this information
to decide to play my character that is in a populated higher-end zone
and may LD within 2 minutes of logging into the server in an unsafe area,
or playing my lil' mage in way overpopulated Tox forest (population: me
and some druid passing through).  I also can use this information when
I go LD and notice that I appear to be the only one.  This leads me to
believe that it's my own crappy computer's fault, or my ISP's.  When that
same information lets me see that the server population went from 2230
to 14 in about 3 minutes, the guide can't very well tell me it's my fault.

It won't get me on any quicker to know, but it lets me know whether to
wait or fix something on my own end.

I'm extremely happy for you.

Which is not me.  I like lots of changes.  I post on them,
congratulating VI and posting "check this out" on the Safehouse.
Some changes I don't like.  I post about them, questioning
VI on their own message board.  I'll also post something here,
simply because I know that the folks at VI do read this
stuff occasionally.

My balls are never shown on Usenet...upayme4porn.com,
maybe, but not on Usenet.

Did I ever say that I thought this was bad enough to quit the
game I really enjoy over?  Nobody forces me to play, but
losing server population numbers does affect me in minor
ways, which I've posted about more than one time.  I
never said "FU verant" (except for about rogue's sneak/hide
not working through a zoning because of bad code-design),
and certainly not because of this.  It's simply a bad decision
in my mind, and one that I hope somebody at VI sees, and,
more importantly, sees WHY.
