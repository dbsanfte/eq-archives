I found this to be an easy quest. The hard part is camping Dyllin. He has a
6 hour
spawn rate. It is hard for me to sit and wait like that but I was lucky and
only
had to wait about 1.5 hours. Don't do what I did though. I accidently hit
the A
button against Mordoo (sp) and had the guards kill me. It was a long trek
from
FM. :)
