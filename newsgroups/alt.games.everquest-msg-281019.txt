At the low levels in EQ  a good tight battle where you barely escape
death was a big thrill.  At  the higher levels in EQ, with 96% (or
even 90%) rez death wasn't such a big deal in EQ.  The main thing that
always worried me in EQ was the chance of losing gear.  That held me
back from really exploring the game as fully as I would have liked to.
That was certainly one of the attractions of LDoN... the knowledge
that in a reasonable amount of time my body was guaranteed to pop out.

And death in WoW isn't quite as painless as some people make out.  You
lose gear durability and you either have to carefully rez near your
corpse while trying to figure out which wandering mob is going to come
over and whack you, or you get to rez at the graveyard but take a big
durability hit and a temporary stat hit.
