My friend has a 45 chanter as his main. After I deleted my 31 wiz (long
story... wanted to quit and deleting my character would keep me from coming
back, or so I thought. I came back and made new characters), I asked him
about enchanters. Illusions are awesome, permanent Breeze/Clarity was nice,
and mezzing and charming in general just seemed cool. He said to me in these
exact words:

"You got frustrated when you died with your wizard, right?"
I said, "Oh yeah...root broke so often when soloing, it sucked"
He said "THen DON'T play an enchanter. It's worse. People don't listen to
you, and you die 10 times as much from idiot warriors breaking mez in
groups. If the wiz was getting you down, you don't want a chanter"

He was right. I ended up making a necro, which is very easy and fun (I hate
getting frustrated by EQ, some people I know don't care when they die, but
it pisses me off a lot, so I wanted a class that would seldome die. Necros,
with FD, Harmsheild, and a pet to hold off mobs, were my best choice) But
anyways, my point is that my chanter friend had the same complaints.

It is hard sometimes because NO ONE seems to know what /assist is. SOme
people just click on any of the 2 or 3 mobs and start attacking, mezz'd or
not.

I HATE those people. "No casters"... what a jerk. Don't worry, it will end
up hurting him in the end when he gets booted from a raid or even a guild
for his bias. Were I a guild leader, and someone said that, They'd be out.

Anyways, be safe and Have fun.
