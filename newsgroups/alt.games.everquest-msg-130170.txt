We are discussing your false claims about what is in the 
AI report.  My statement is correct.  Your claim about
what was in the AI report was false.  Appealing to a 
*different* authority does not change that.

The AI article does not support this claim either.  

As I stated, I am not interested in debating every claim
you can drag up made by every advocacy group you can think
of, any more than I am interested in debating people who
drag up web sites "showing" that it was the Jews who
flew into the World Trade Center or articles that "show"
that the holocaust didn't happen.

My point was, and remains, that your statement about what
was in the AI article was false and hyperbolic and was a
dishonest appeal to authority.  I have demonstrated that.
