At level 52, if he quests for it, a shaman gets Blood of Nadox, remove 18 
counters each of poison and disease from all group members.  Damned handy 
for chests like that, as well as for those aoe dot/slow Blood of Thule 
casting lizards in CT.  Doesn't help any in the 30s of course, but, for a 
mid 50s group where Radiant Cure is not likely available, it can be 
invaluable.  Heck, even at 65, it's very handy, as the refresh time on it 
is much freindlier than RC.
