If you look elsewhere on this thread, I give several reasons why
you would want a hotkey version of the combat panel attack
button.  If all you want is a "autoattack on/off" toggle, any key
will of course do, heck, leave it on A if you like.  For hitting mobile
mobs, or for med/melee bouncing, the visible attack key is
of primary importance.

Again, now you don't have visual confirmation of your sitting/standing
status.  The key to the hotkeys is not that they are hotkeys... you can
use the keyboard remapping feature to make any buttons you want
into those, whats special about the hotkey panels is that those buttons
(and inventory slots) work just like the real things off your various
combat/main/skill and inventory/equipped slots.  Visual confirmation,
item swapping, item clicking... things you CAN'T do by mapping something
to the letter m

Spells and songs, too are visual confirmation if you
drag their hotkey into a panel.  Personally I rely on
the spell icon shortcuts for spells and songs, and
use socials for more complex macros like
Casting CHeal on [ %T ]
cast 1
delay 3
cast 1

or
Chain Stun on [%t]
cast 2
cast 3
cast 4
cast 5

I (don't yell) always used to click the icons on the list at that point.

I dont think theres any doubt that a mage pet is going to wipe the
floor with a druid OR cleric pet.
