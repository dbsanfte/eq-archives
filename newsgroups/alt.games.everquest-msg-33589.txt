If you can be grouped with someone and trick them into running off a high 
building(or especially a platform in Kelethin), then bind them in midair... 
Eventually they die or camp without Levitate on. When they pop, they drop, 
then pop, then drop, then pop, then drop...

I think this would be abeautiful thing to do to those 40-60 eBayers. Watch 
all them expensive levels get sucked down the toilet. :)
