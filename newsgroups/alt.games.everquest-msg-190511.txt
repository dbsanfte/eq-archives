The other two tank classes can solo.  I should know, my Paladin has done
soloing for 75% of her career.  How well do you expect a warrior to solo?
Why should he be the absolute best at tanking?  Becase there is -nothing-
else he can do.  Give a Warrior the ability to go out there and solo
effectively, and you may have a case.

Any suggestion that they shouldn't be able to hold aggro better than a
knight deserves a solid stomping.

Clerics are warriors are the bread and butter of raids, I agree.  Until
warriors have a career outside group tanking, I think it's appropriate that
they be on that pedistal.  I agree the knight classes need some help, but
not at the expense of de-valuing warriors.

I'll tell you what, when a warrior is as powerful as a druid, then you can
start complaining.
