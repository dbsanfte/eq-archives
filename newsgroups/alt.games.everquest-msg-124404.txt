I was extremely wary of this thing they did recently, removing "server
GMs" and making them all "floating" between servers. However, I'm a
little more comfortable with it over the past couple days. 3 times
I've petitioned over these days, and all 3 times, the wait was no more
than an hour and a full GM showed up to take care of the issue. I've
noted that there are times when no guides will be present. Previously,
anyone who petitioned at that time was out of luck. However, with the
change, the GMs can see that a petition queue is getting backed up on
a particular server and that no guides are present and pop in there to
clear it up.

'course, there are drawbacks. It was easier working with a single
head-GM on your server because if you dealt with them a few times you
got familiar with their style. Overall, though, the change looks
posative. It may not be a huge improvement, but I think it makes
things a little better...
