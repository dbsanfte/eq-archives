bLacK H3liCoPt3Rz are one thing, but this is exactly what verant does with
every new zone they release (at least, those that are feasible to hunt
in...nobody went and farmed the temple of sol ro when it came out).

If you are going to play luclin, be sure you have the game THAT DAY...the
sooner you get in, the better your odds of getting something good before
either the drop, the mob, or the item are nerfed. I still kick myself that
I didn't go into DL and get a jewel encrusted ring during the first couple
days of kunark...cause that sucker just doesn't drop anymore, anywhere.
