I found out that my account had 5 days left active since I cancelled
it; logged in ti find my family guild empty. There was a guild message
saying that the guild was being disbanded due to the fact that almost
everyone had quit EQ, and it was almost impossible to recruit new
members. I logged in around 3 PM on Saturday and saw this message, and
there was NO ONE from the guild on, out of the 30+/- that were left
(mostly alts that that point).

I am sure that this is NOT a freak occurance for family guilds, across
all servers.
