Dunno about that, sorry. Try getting a price check in your server's auction 
zone (EC/NFP/GFay - wherever it is on your server).

It would depend on your server, the market for blue diamonds there and the 
competition between high level jewellers.

For example, I used to be on MT. There were not huge numbers of 250+ 
jewellers. There were not huge numbers of uberguilds. Blue diamonds sold in 
EC for about 2kpp. Resist gear made from diamonds/BDs was probably 30k/set 
for top of the line stuff.

I am now on Antonius Bayle. There are loads of uberguilds, hence many more 
planar gem drops, people transferring from old-economy servers bringing 
their existing jewellery with them etc. Lots of high level enchanter 
jewellers. Blue diamonds sell in EC for about 750pp. Also, increased 
competition between jewellers and less demand for the product means there 
is less of a profit margin on the stuff. Resist gear is all half-price 
compared to MT.
