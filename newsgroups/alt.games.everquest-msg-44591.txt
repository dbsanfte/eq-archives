I think the only time I ever used it was to look for crocodiles in
oasis whilst training divination, and during a SK spire camp to look
for something to turn into a pet.

Track only helps telling you what's closer if you're a ranger. I'm
suffering from old style ranger tracking blues with my druid; the only
thing I can use it for is to check for nameds (PC or NPC :) ) and get
a feel of the general mob level in a zone.
