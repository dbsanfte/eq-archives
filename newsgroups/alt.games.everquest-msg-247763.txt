Yeah it is.  Chasm crawlers share the same spawn table with crag spiders.
If you can't find crags, kill the chasm crawlers and crags will spawn again.
If you kill any other type of mob (for example, gnoll reavers, gorge hounds,
lions, or even bullnose snakes) you won't see any increase in the spawns of
crag spiders.
