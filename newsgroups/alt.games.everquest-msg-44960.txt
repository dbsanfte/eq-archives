However unlike LOIO/FV/FM/OT/DL you have to bind two zones away through
an area with many green aggros for your CR.  LOIO (can be bound in
Cabilis or FV is close by). FV city zone.  FM has a bindable spot now,
and is also one zone from OT which has a bindable zone.  DL is the only
one that is somewhat further from cities, and it still borders FV and FM
which both have spots a melee can be bound.

Stonebrunt Melee must be bound in Paineel for closest cr, and chances
are that at least when first fighting there you won't have faction to
get a key to grab your spare "CR equipment" from the bank, which means
you need to be two zones further away in Erudin or worse Qeynos if your
an evil race.  There is no real jumping off the boat and bypassing
Erudin like there is where a good race can jump off the boat and avoid
the guards of the evil outpost in OT.  

It really is hard to compare Kunark zones with Stonebrunt.  Yes
stonebrunt was designed to be similar to LOIO in the amounts it can
support etc. but it's not nearly as easy to get too, Perform CR's in,
etc, as LOIO.
