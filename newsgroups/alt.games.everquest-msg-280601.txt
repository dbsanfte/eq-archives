Fascinating development in the news at:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4183340.stm

I've summarized the basic points, below...

"The government in Beijing is reported to be introducing the controls
to deter people from playing [online role-playing games] for longer
than three consecutive hours. ... The new system will impose penalties
on players who spend more than three hours playing a game by reducing
the abilities of their characters.  Gamers who spend more than five
hours will have the abilities of their in-game character severely
limited... Players will be forced to take a five-hour break before
they can return to a game." 

I'm not saying the measures will definitely be introduced, mind you,
but I still find the situation incredible!  Who would have thought,
back in the infancy of online gaming, that a government would even
contemplate introducing legislation like this?  It's a weird world  :)
