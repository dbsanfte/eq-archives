thanks.

Can you tell me how you are figuring the damage rations?  It wouldhelp me
alot on my weapon choice.

Currently, I have a dragoon Dirk as my 1hp and a blackened alloy sword as my
offhand 1hs.  I very them depending on the situation. If I am out by myself,
i putthe 1hs in primary.  If I am grouping, I switch them for the backstab.

With the dirk, I am currently pulling a max of 43pts dmg on a backstab. I am
a yellow bub from 20 and my BS skill is 68.  I can't get that skill up
because I am not able to group much.  With the small group that I play with,
I ususally end up being the tank. My two friends are casters.

I am making the run to EC bazaar soon.  What would you suggest as an
appropriate weapons buy?  I think the Harpoon of Depths is good. Think the
Slime-coated harppon and the serrated tooth is out of my financial reach.
