Lucy says 34.  Not mage specific, it's 34 for everybody.

Though I do see that the in-game text according to Lucy says 24.  I'm not
sure I've ever actually summoned that item so I'll take your word that it
says 24.  Why you'd think it would make sense for an item you get at level
20 that doesn't get replaced until level 44 to stop working 4 levels later
and 20 levels before the replacement is a bit puzzling.  I'd assume it's a
typo, which isn't a huge assumption in this game.  :)

Magicians don't get any extra benefit from their items, though the item
spell levels are staggered so as to fit around magician spells (the nuke
bracelets being an excellent example, one stopping at 34, no nuke at 39, and
the next being available at 44).
