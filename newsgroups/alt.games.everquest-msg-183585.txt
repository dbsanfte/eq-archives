Why would the SK be taking less damage, and need less healing than a monk?

I understand the argument in you're post about the SK taking more of a
beating..  thats plainly obvious, but why is healing any more efficient for
the SK?

The way I see it... SK has more HP.. SK takes more damage.. SK needs more
heals

Dots/taunt are definately a big advantage for the SK, but its viable for
monks also.

In HoH if a named pops (yellow con to 65) I get my ass kicked when its
unslowed, I obviously can't slow it the second its in the camp (or he'd just
kick the shamans ass instead) so I /disc stone (stone stance, big
damage-mitigation disc), build up agro from my damage, and then cast slow.

The plan is for my succesful slow ro land just as my disc ends (debuffed the
mob during the course of my disc-shaman debuffs are pretty small agro)

Disc and mend would both be available for getting that fight under control
while attempting to slow it, and it works great for me (I only have to worry
about it for the named though, not every pull)

But you still need mana to heal the SK too.
