It just got a LOT easier, thank Brell. ;)

Selling for 1500 would indicate a motivated seller, of which there's
occasionally a few.  Tinkering had so few uses other than rebreathers,
though, that it's rare for anyone who took the time to get up to that
skill level to sell them for less than 2k.

The new items from SoL may change all that, though.  I've heard the
items for one of them cost 3pp per attempt and the item doesn't
trivial at 205.   The ingredients are all bought or drop in a low-level
zone as well.

If that's true, it just got a LOT easier to master tinkering without doing
it strictly for the rebreather selling cost or role-playing or just plain
"it's
there" reasons.   At least from casual observation of the recipes, it's
like making cultural armor for 3pp per attempt with roughly the same
possibility of selling the results.   In a word, "w00h00!"
