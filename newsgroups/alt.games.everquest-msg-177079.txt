I was in a great group today in Misty Eye.  We had:

Mage
Warrior
Shadow Knight
Cleric

I (the cleric) rooted adds, chain stunned and healed. Mage had nukes and
mage pet had nukes (water pet). Shadow Knight had harm touch and tanked.
Warrior did what warriors do.  We had very little down time and only had to
run to the zone once when we were trained.
