And if I could raid more I would, but I can't. Its not going to happen.

Only to be turned down for 1-groupable content after they've gone as far 
as they can go without raiding, putting in more time than a hardcore 
raider to get there. And that's the hypothetical -freak- 1-group 
warriors.. the average one is much further behind.

If a guild raids once a week off peak with no attendance and you have an 
erratic schedule the odds of you going on raids once a week is pretty 
slim. Once a month, maybe. (And if its off peak with no attendance req, 
raids get cancelled or downgraded due to attendance pretty frequently... 
I can tell you that much from experience)

And nobody does. But I expect to be better equipped relative to you than 
I am. I might be 1/5th your gear despite playing 1/2 as much. That's 
just wrong.

Power gain should be a diminishing return. That's why levels take longer 
and longer as you gain them, why AAs aren't as good as 'levels' (most of 
the time), etc. Its also why the best items are rare drops, while the 
lesser items drop commonly. Surely we agree on this?

If I play half as much as you, I should have 4/5ths your equipment, if 
someone plays TWICE as much you you should have 4/5ths THEIR equipment. 

Beleive it or not this isn't whining about entitlement, its a reflection 
of how diminishing returns for more effort *should* be working. And in 
EQ it does work for some classes of player at some stages of the game, 
but in many other cases its just out to lunch. 

For example a peak-time raider has better gear by far than someone who 
plays THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME but off-peak, doing 1-group content, and 
catching the odd raid or pickup raid when they can. 

In this case: time = effort = reward ISN'T WORKING!

You know what, I mostly agree. When the issue is strictly limited 
playtime, I do expect them to drag behind the curve, although I'd like 
to see them get more out of each expansion than they do.

But again you're only considering LIMITED play time. You are NOT 
considering adequate playtime, but restricted from raiding for whatever 
reason (off-peak, erratic schedule, children...)

For my part, I play enough, more than some raiders I know. Just not at 
the right times, or regularly.

Quite right, they're all lined up at the trough of DoN instanced 
missions because its the only place they can get groups, and the only 
place they can get even remotely half decent gear. 

But they aren't happy grinding it. 

(And when they've finished grinding it, and try to hookup with where the 
rest of the player base is they're still passed over... if they're tanks 
at least, and then its time to roll an alt that isn't a tank to grind 
some more DoNs or maybe get gimped through a pop flag raid or something  
while you wait for the next newbie-zone in the next expansion... whee.)
