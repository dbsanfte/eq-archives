DT, surveys are a science, despite what Samuel Clemens had to say about
statistics.  The sample size relative to the population size has a
significant effect on the accuracy.  There is no absolute guarantee that the
survey is accurate, however, there is a very high likelihood that the
accuracy falls within a calculable range.  There is a reason why a margin of
error is generally given with survey results.  These are quantities that can
be calculated given knowledge of the factors involved, including the
population size, and the sample size.  I don't know that the survey in
question has any significant accuracy, as I didn't dig through the site to
try and find information on that.
