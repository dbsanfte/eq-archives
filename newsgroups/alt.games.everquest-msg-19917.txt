Playing my necro, I usually set my pet to "guard here" in a nice pull spot
(no wanderers), and pull to it. I guess when im playing my druid I tend to
have this in mind and just sow the caster. Sometimes people will ask me
"pet?" and of course ill sow their pet too, but I tend to assume they wont
need it. Same with regen... i cast it on the necromancer but not on the pet
for obvious reasons.

Its a pain to ask, but most people who drop sow on you for nothing will
probably sow your pet too if they know its gonna be useful.

Now what irks me off is when u drop a sow on someone, and then they ask for
strength buffs, skin, and do you have wolfform instead of sow, and expect
you to sit down and memorize all that crap. Then they send u a tell in a few
hours (from another zone) asking you for a port. being nice is not without
its price.
