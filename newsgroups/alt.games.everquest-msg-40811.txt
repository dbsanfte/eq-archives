The nice thing about going through a hell level is how fast you zip
through the four levels after it. One gets used to that blue line barely
moving, then ding! and Zip! Zip! Zip! Zip! Oh, shit, hell again.

It took me quite a while before I remembered I could just sit down to
med. And yes, It is absolutely wonderful. Then you have your groupmates
tell you, "Hey, idiot! SIT to med!!" I forget to sit down sometimes, or
forget to notice if I am sitting.
