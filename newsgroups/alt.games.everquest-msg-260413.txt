I think the pressure came from the bean counters.

Goodwill is a big factor of a game community... but you aren't going to 
earn it by letting people shit in your community.

The cost associated with cancelling accounts and terminating that 
revenue stream should have been deducted from the advertising budget. 
Because that's what it is... good advertising.

You can literally buy the enduring loyalty of the 'good players' by 
banning the worst of the crowd. And the price is only 12.95/mo per 
banning... that's pretty cheap as advertising goes.

Better yet, each time you ban a new account belonging to the same guy 
you actually end up ahead as the twit keeps buying new boxes at $60+.
