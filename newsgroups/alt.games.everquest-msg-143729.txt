You *must* fight blues or higher to improve your melee skills.

You gain more often on successful skill rollls than unsuccessful ones, and
it's very hard to succeed using a level 1 character's skill against a level
16 mob's defense... so it goes up pretty slowly to start.

Drop 5 or 10 practice points into it at the trainer and it will shoot up
from there.

Also, remember that under level 30, dual wield fires off very rarely, so if
you're trying to train the skill up in your off hand, you're only getting
1/3 or 1/4 of the swings that you would get main handing it.    Try using
the weapon you are learning in main hand, and swapping a piercer in and out
each time backstab refreshes.
