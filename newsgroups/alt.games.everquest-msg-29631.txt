The tome is available at the gypsy camp in North Karana and at the gypsy
camp in Oasis. You trade a GLS for it. The reason GLSs go for about 7-8pp
each is because of the tome. You can trade GLSs for one, turn to the next
vendor and sell it for about 9pp. This can be repeated as many times as you
have GLSs. Remember to keep a slot open as the tome counts as a container.
