My ISP's DNS Sever was up and down like a yoyo a few days ago and I got a
similar message.  I'm on ADSL and I found that if I drop my assigned IP and
re-connect I usually get assigned an IP from a different scope, and that
fixes the problem.

To test to see if it is your ISP try browsing to web pages you don't
normally go to and ones that others are not likely visit often - this will
test the DNS lookup (rather than cached DNS entries), if the web sites can
not be found chances are it's your ISP.  Try re-connecting.

HTH,

Lex
