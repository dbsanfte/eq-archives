You need to make sure that you have completely removed the Matrox
drivers, and that you have the latest ATI drivers for the Radeon 8500.
Follow the instructions below, and you should be ok.

Installation steps:

1. Download and install/re-install DirectX8.1

http://www.microsoft.com/directx

2. If you are running an AMD Athlon or Duron processor on a VIA
chipset motherboard download and install the latest Via4in1 drivers
(4.38) from:
 http://www.viahardware.com/download/index.shtm#4in1

Also download and install the AGP 4.10B driver found lower down on the
same page.

 3. Download the correct driver and extract it to a folder.

4. Follow the driver Removal and Installation guide found at the
following link. DO NOT skip any steps. This guide will ensure that you
have completely removed the old drivers and registry entries. (Be sure
you get the whole link...you might have to cut and paste it in 2
pieces depending on your news reader)
