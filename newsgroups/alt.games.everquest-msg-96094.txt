I don't know if anyone else has replied to this yet (for some reason my
news server is still stuck on the 9th of March), but the best site I have
found for this yet is at:

http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showMessage?topicID=42.topic

I wish they would put it at a shorter URL, but well...there it is. :) If a
dwarven paladin can do it, I'd think a High Elf Wizard could too.  It's
just a heckuva lot of work.
