Ah, didn't know that, well not so important then.  Haven't played my 
halfing druid since they put the SOL portal system in, much less POK 
books; he was created only to operate as a porter for the alts of my 
friend, who's main would port my alts (or main) so we could partner 
together without one of us having to cross vast distances on foot or by 
(shudder) boat.  Could I level him up to where he gets the few still 
useful ports (CS, SF and... hmm thats it isn't it?).  Yes I could but I 
just don't care enough to do so, since that particular friend retired 
from the game anyway.

Yep, shopping, buying spells, doing some non-mana-related trade skill, 
heck, just sitting LFG if thats something you indulge in.

Question is, is there a use for non-imbued pebbles, such that it might 
make sense to sell some that way now that they are stackable?
