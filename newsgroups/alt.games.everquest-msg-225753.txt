Exp slows down as you level up, because the exp required to level 
increases dramatically, and the difficulty of mobs, both in terms of HP 
and damage output goes up faster than the same stats on PCs.  On top of 
this, the degree to which you are "twinked" drops as you approach the 
higher end of the game; where at level 10 you could be in gear 10 times 
as good as you "should" have for very little money, at level 50 you are 
hard put to be in gear twice as good as you "should" have unless you 
have a higher level "sugar daddy" to supply you.

Your exp report is more or less typical for most classes, in that you 
are seeing a decline in exp per hour as you level up, doing essentially 
the same thing.

But I think you are getting low end exp, I see roughly double what you 
are reporting, both pre 50 and post 50 (same proportional drop in exp, 
just from 2 yellow to 1 yellow per hour instead of from 1 yellow to 1/2 
yellow per hour).  Grouping, or even playing with a partner, can help 
this quite a lot depending on your play style, often coordinated effort 
means you kill far more than twice as many mobs per hour, but only split 
the exp in half... with a 20% bonus for doing it.

But wait there's more.  As a bard, you should be getting the fastest exp 
of any class, not the slowest, and getting it solo.  Rats at 49?  No, 
no, POD rats are tough critters, higher resists, higher HP totals, 
higher damage output too... but some of them are immmune to your charms. 
  Worst of all, they are hard to find in quantity.  What you want to 
kill are the Flies; half as tough, almost as much exp per each kill, all 
charmable, and best of all, there are Lots of them to kill.  Charm one, 
bring him over to the rock, and run circles while his buddies kill him 
for you; when he's almost dead, break charm, finish him off, then charm 
a new target and repeat.  Six flies biting your one fly means that the 
high mob DPS is working in your favor instead of against it, I challenge 
anyone (outside a PB AE group) to compete with this kind of DPS.

Speaking of PB AE, there's another bard plan I've heard of, where you 
round up large quantites of mobs and then make close passes by them 
singing your PB AE song.  Since charm swarming has as a drawback that at 
large numbers you can easily see your pet dying before you break charm 
to get the exp, this might be a way to outdamage the charm swarm plan; 
get very very large numbers all being sandpapered away by your AE 
instead.  I never mastered this plan, as the line between "too far away 
to hit with the AE" and "so close that the mobs can hit you with melee" 
was too fine a one for me to work with.

My mage stopped over in TD at the Spirocs a few days back, only to see 
to his chagrin that a bard was there with what looked like every bird in 
the village pulled over to the big open area between raft and dock.  I 
went on over to see if he'd missed anything, just so I could experiment 
with how easy they would be and how much exp...  when birds started 
streaming back towards me.  At first I thought somehow he'd gotten out 
of range of some, or that they'd started running when Low HP, and he'd 
come clean up.  But then I checked /who and found I was alone in the 
zone, and surrounded by birds with as little as 5% of their HP bars 
left.  I set to work with a vengeance, killing them off as fast as I 
could, but by the end the last few stragglers were fully healed when I 
finally got to them.

Clearly the bard had been AE kiting, and got too close once too often; 
15 birds each taking one swing at you is like one bird with 1500% haste, 
and if any of them get a stun in they get a second round while you 
aren't running and... well its over quick.  If he'd been charm kiting, 
then you'd see one bird very badly injured and one or two more that are 
a bit hurt, and the rest full HP.
