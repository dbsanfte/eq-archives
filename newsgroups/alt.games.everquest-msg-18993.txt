Hmm.  Going to have to disagree with you on that one, 
Richard.  Certainly, _some_ of them have gone there.  
I just checked it out.  I found 458 auctions with
"everquest" in the title, 1081 with "eq", and 1508
for "e q".  The "e q" seemed to return everything
with "everquest" in the title.  But lets be generous.
We're looking at 3047 at the most, using these parameters.
Personally, though, I think the above figure reflects
alot of redundancy.  The word "drinal", which happens 
to be the server I play on, returned 34 results. Ok,
maybe I just happen to play on a dud server.  So I
tried "nameless".  This returned 139 results.  More
impressive, yes, but hardly earth shaking.
   I wish I had thought to write down the figures when
they were available, but I know that Ebay, in it's
prime, had _alot_ more.  Several thousands. Hundreds, 
if not thousands, for every server.  Can anyone back
me up on this?
   So I maintain that no auction sites have taken the 
place of Ebay, at least in scale.  My original question
stands.
