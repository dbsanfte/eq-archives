Beastlord? So you too follow the practice of "summon groupmate"?  Let them
fight one, you fight the other (since the areas of Warrens I've been in so
far generally have one mob on one side, another adjacent to them, one for
each of you).  And when my pet kills his first (VERY often, even if higher
/con, now that I've buffed him and he starts strong anyway, though conning
blue, and doesn't miss as much, plus hits for 16 max), then I let him take
over mine while I loot the other (good luck finding a non-summonable
groupmate who will let you do this, same with medding while they fight,
standing up only to loot or find another mob for THEM to solo so you can
loot it).
