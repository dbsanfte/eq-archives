Well then you (and possibly Your Guys) missed the point of the game.  If you
(and possibly Your Guys) were to actually try and join forces and cooperate
with the rest of your realm in a battle, you would find a much better chance
of success, as well as exploring the game to its fullest potential.  Yes,
it's easier to organize a group of 6 people, but wars are not won with
groups of 6 people.

If you insist on playing it as one-on-one Quake, it's not surprising that a
game geared for much larger conflicts disappoints you.  You're simply
playing the wrong game ("game wrong").
