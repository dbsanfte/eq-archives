Hello!  Im completely new to EQ2, but the bit i've played so far has got me 
totally in love with it.
I finally got EQ2 for christmas from my friend.  I played EQ1 ages and ages 
ago.So here I am, looking for groovy tips and helpful hints.    Im just 
wondering if ya'll have a FAQ for this group, so I dont' get flamed for 
saying the wrong thing.  Heh.


I look forward to participating in this group, and PLEASE tell me it's not 
full of 13 year olds who want to Pwn everything?
