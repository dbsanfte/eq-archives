}Well that was the last straw. I saw a twink with better gear then me.
}Granted im used to seeing this, but this a level 15 twink!!! 

There will always be twinks with better gear than you.  Don't worry about 
it, it's really not a big deal.

}He inspected me
}and started laughing the sad part is he's right some of my gear is very
}embarrassing for my level of 43.

Ohhh... you mean you saw an -asshole- with better gear than you.  I'm 
sorry, but I consider laughing at another person's gear exceptionally 
rude.

}1. Is it worth doing the paw of oopala quest to replace the spirit tome? Is
}the extra 3 wis and other stats worth it?

No, not at all.  If you're high enough level to hunt hill giants, you can 
earn enough plat to buy a paw in less time than it would take to camp 
Gynok -or- the damn mutant fungus.  Well, unless you got really lucky.

}2. Any ideas on the arms or legs?

Heh, there aren't a lot of easily available cleric legs.  I've met plenty 
of 50+ clerics still wearing gatorscale.  (I can't get magelo to work, so 
I'm preachin' in the dark here. :) 

}3. BP, I was told that a froglok scaled tunic or sebilite scal coat would be
}good to get. The quest in twilight sea seems like a decent bp. I had the
}cheastplate of the constant but the lack of wis was a big drawback.  Any
}ideas?

The twilight sea quests are a huge timesink. :/  Seb Scale is good stuff.

}4. Just need 1 more egg and i'll be able to finish up the stuff for the 3
}and 4 shawls. That will replace my range slot item. is there a better range
}slot item or shoulder item out there?

Yeap... But that one'll last you well into your 50's, so don't worry about 
it.

}5. Jewelry upgrades is it worth it to get my platinum stuff upgraded to
}velium so i can have the extra +3 wis and +1 str it would provide?

Sure, and now may be a really good time what with the bazaar deflating the 
jewery market.  Make sure, if you sell the old ones, to find out how much 
a vendor will give you first.  Market price has been getting close to 
vendor price and it'd suck to go under.

}7. Earring of the solstice:  this would be really nice and i can probably
}make some of the stuff.  I was told that the FT 1 wont work if your 51  is
}this true?

I think it works at 51, but not below?
