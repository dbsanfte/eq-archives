Yes, true - I had seen the offer on the Sony site, but they just had
bare-bones info, and at that price I assumed it was a digital
download, albeit one of colossal proportions, heh.  Since then I found
out that, cheap as it is, the Titanium set is actually a boxed set of
5 disks. Outstanding value, really, and it even includes 30 days of
play!

I have actually found a site in the UK that sells the set, and they
also do the Prophecy of Ro boxed set too, so I'll give that a try I
think.

Thanks all!
