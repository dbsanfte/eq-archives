I was reading a little on the Warrens in some old messages and noticed that
someone said teh Erudin / Qeynos boat hasn't been upgraded with speed or
with the addition of another boat, like the Freeport / BB one ( from "The
Warrens" thread of 10 / 04 ).

I'm not sure how long this has been in game, but I'm pretty sure there are 2
boats that do the trip between Erudin and Qeynos.  The Sea King and
something that starts with an "M".
