No, I haven't... This is my main, so it's not a twink.
Biggest amount of money I ever had in bank was 1.6k,
and though I did get some nice presents from higher levels
(sapphire platinum necklace, loam encrusted sash) - I still
only have 192 int (mainly because I play look over usability, though)
and low resists..

A real lot of fun!

Example:
Yesterday I did 45 in Dreadlands, in a group, and we had from 2
up to 6 members, changing a lot.
I was grouped with rangers, pallies, clerics, shamans, chanters and rogues.
A lot of the time we didn't have a healer, so we fear kited (ok, rangers can
also fear) and I healed, worked out well.
Then we only had shaman, warrior and me, so I twitched the Shaman
and Mezzed adds.
As we had a chanter and/or cleric, I just did my share of snaring/nuking and
siccing pet, and soloed the occasional add.

Now don't go and tell me necros are no addition to a group.
I think - as many people have pointed out - we are as useful
to a group as any other class, if played right.

Plus we can replace some of the special abilities of "essential" classes...

Just my 2c,
