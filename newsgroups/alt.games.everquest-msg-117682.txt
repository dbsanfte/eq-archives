Well apart from the fact that you are trying to sell something that you have
no rights to sell and therefore trying to commit fraud, I particularly like
the part about "in good guild". I don't suppose it will be for long though.
What good guild would accept members who sell their characters like this, or
would allow a character to stay in after someone bought it?
