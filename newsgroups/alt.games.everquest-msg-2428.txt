I've been playing around on the first three floors of ToFS with a small
group (49 Wizard, 52 Ranger, 56 Cleric).  We've been mostly on the
second floor, to get a Student's Homework for me (Wizard) and for the
Ranger's twink Necro, and a Teacher's Syllabus for the Cleric.

I've noticed two interesting things.

First, there's something odd about the aggro of the mobs.  Say the
Cleric pulls something (no, I don't know why the Cleric is pulling).
No matter how early I nuke...even if I nuke before the mob gets to us
and the Ranger engages it, the mob almost never aggros on me.  Most of
the things on the second floor seem to have around 1000-1200 hitpoints,
and I'm starting off with a 774 point nuke (Rend).  After a few fights,
when the Ranger is low and the Cleric throws off a CH, the mobs stay on
the Ranger.

I know Rangers can taunt, and they tend to be very good at staying high
on the hate list, but come on...nuking a mob for 70% of its health at
the start of a fight should at least get some notice. :-)

Second, the mobs here seem pretty low on hitpoints.  We went up to the
third floor to check it out, and the skeleton things there also seemed
to be around 1000-1200 hitpoints, but they were *blue* to me.  It seems
to be a party of low 30's would have no trouble with them.  I wonder if
the third floor of ToFS would be an awesome place for a low 30's group
to get XP?  The mobs would be easy, red, and fast spawning, and it's a
dungeon so should have a good XP multiplier.
