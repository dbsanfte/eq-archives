I just want to know why a 42 necro or a 55 cleric would bother to camp orcs?
You get no xp and crap loot.  It makes sense that you would have to share the
camp with people who can get xp, if i wander into a camp thats unoccupied and
everything cons green to me and someone that can get xp from the mobs shows up
there I relinquish the camp to them.  I had it done for me when i was a newbie.
