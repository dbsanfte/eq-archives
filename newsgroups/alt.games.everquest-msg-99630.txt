Depends on where you were dropped off.

If the ticket reads from New York to 1234 Maple Street, I will expect to be
dropped off at 1234 Maple Street. If the ticket reads New York to Chicago, I
expect to be dropped off in Chicago at the bus station. If the ticket reads
New York to Chicago, I expect to be dropped off at the bus station in
Chicago, not South Bend.

A better analogy was that you're a black man during segregation taking a bus
from Chicago to [Big metropolitan area in the south] and they drop you off
in [Some podunk town nearby.]
