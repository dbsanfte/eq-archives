Little thing you might wanna be aware of: People sending direct tells
to GMs and guides only make response time to those who actually
petition and wait slower... Some guides can't get it through their
heads that if someone is bugging them with direct tells, tell them to
petition if they haven't already, "we'll get to you when your turn
comes", then ignore further tells. Sound rude? Not nearly as rude as
thinking you're somehow better than all the other people who are
patiently waiting their turn in the petition queue...
