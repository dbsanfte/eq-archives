My little 16 SK decided to check out some tasks today.  From Akanon I 
was directed to BB, in BB there are several task people, you can use the 
Find button to locate them.  I checked out a couple, each offered a 
choice of three tasks, pick one and you can't get another till that 
first one is done (or I guess there might be some way to drop the one 
you've got)

Anyway, selecting a quest, I was told to run to the adventurer's camp in 
DC.  Which by the way was filled with red to me mobs, hostile to my 
faction as a gnome SK.   But I was able to get sufficiently close to 
trigger the task stage without getting aggro.  Backed away, and the next 
stage had appeared, I was to look at the fireplace in Unrest.  Well that 
was a little more challenging, since I've never really spent time in 
that zone, but as it turns out, I'm dubious to the Death Beetles, and 
ITU worked fine against everything else I ran into.  So I ran around the 
manor a bit, and discovered that the top of the stair was sufficient to 
trigger that stage complete.  Looking around a bit more before leaving, 
there is indeed a fireplace up there.

Now, back to a mob in BB.  When I zoned into BB, I got a pointer on my 
compass to help locate him; after a bit of running into impassable walls 
I figured out where I actually had to go and was able to use the map to 
steer a course there, next to the chessboard.  Hailed the mob, and got 
exp and some coin (a bit under 2pp).  Good to finally find out what all 
those mobs all over the place who say "I'm waiting for someone very 
important" are there for; apparantly they are end stages in quests.

At any rate, I'd rate this quest very dissapointing, I had to do a bunch 
of running, no fighting, and got very little reward, I'd have been 
significantly better off just fighting mobs... like say the ones in Unrest.

Second mission again sent me to unrest, but this time to kill 10 beetles 
and loot 4 mushrooms.  OK, I killed about 30 of the beetles, before 
finally discovering that the mushrooms drop much more often from some of 
the other mobs hanging out outside the manor.  Sadly, most of the 
beetles were cyan to me, and the rest a fairly low dark blue, but still, 
there's apparantly a decent ZEM at work, and I did get noticable exp, 
dinged 17, while working my way thru this quest.  This time my "Contact" 
was out in DC, I had to deliver the 4 mushrooms to him... and again I 
got barely noticable exp and just under 2pp.

If I could stack up several tasks to the same area, this might be worth 
doing.  If I could pick my task, knowing what it was before accepting 
it, it might be worth looking for a task to do something I was already 
going to do, sort of a bonus.  Or if the task was suited to my race and 
class.  Or if the reward was something, say a tribute point or some 
such.  But as it stands, well, getting told to go do a bunch of running 
around in random zones?  These would be vaguely interesting for a bard 
or druid or someone with lots of run speed... they'd be more interesting 
if the time was limited there, though.

All in all, seem like snoozers, unless there' something I'm missing.
