I've seen many shaman suggest that root/rot is an ineffective way to
kill mobs, that without a very high mana pool they usually don't have
enough mana to actually kill anything, and need to jump in and melee to
get the job finished.  While this won't likely be a problem with KEI,
the fact that it exists at all suggests to me that melee is actually
saving them mana, if thats the case then it must be somewhat efficient
(perhaps only compared to running Canna and spending the HP that way)

Still, the cost of quickness and slow do add up a bit.  Compare to the
cost of keeping root on the prey while waiting for it to die, and of
using the smaller less efficient DOTS to speed kill time up, and see if
you come out ahead.

If I changed to a root/rot kill method, you'd certainly be correct.  If
I continue with the kill plan I've outlined, though, I think I'd be a
fool to forgo Slow, and almost as much a fool to forgo haste.

Further note, I doubt that my melee sucks as badly as you think; I don't
get a damage bonus, but a 30 warrior doesn't get a large damage bonus
either.  I don't get dual weild or dual attack, but that 30 warrior
isn't having those skills fire off as often as all that yet either  (and
he doesn't get that damage bonus on his offhand anyway. )  My skill is
capped lower than the warriors (4 per level instead of 5 per level) but
the difference at 30 isn't that large (30 points more or less, as the
formula is a trifle more complex than I stated).

I found that my cleric was doing more damage per mana spent (healing
himself when meleeing versus cost of nuke) via melee than via nuke up
into the 40s, and again up past 56 to around 60.  Comparing priest melee
to warrior melee is a bit of a straw man, what we need to look at is
cost of melee versus cost of not meleeing!

Ideally, I'd get a partner and have him melee.  In this case I'd still
want to slow mob and haste partner.  And since mob would already be
engaged and slowed, I'd have to compare my melee hasted and not hasted
to see if spending the mana on hasting me would be an efficient use of
mana.  And I'd have to compare the mana lost due to not sitting to the
melee output, to see if I'd be better off on my trollish buttocks.

All in all, its a pretty complex question.

Paax, wisdom under 80, why am -I- supposed to be thinking about this!
