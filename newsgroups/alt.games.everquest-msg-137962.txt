Isn't this tied in with the whole police beatings in CA thing -- or was that
a news story from here?  Anyhow. There was something recently about an
alleged criminal who was in custody and spit at the police officer.  The
officer felt justified in punching this individual, since spitting at a
police officer was a felony offense.  It was pointed out that an ordinary
civilian should not do this, however, as an individual spitting on another
individual is only a misdemeanor (and of course ordinary citizens do not
have the "right" to beat on other ordinary citizens).
