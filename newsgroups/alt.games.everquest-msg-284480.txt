As I understand it, aside from AAs, gear is the only way a bard can
increase his mana regen.  Clarity-type buffs don't help, nor do
twitches or even his own mana songs.  I have not tested any of this yet
though, my bard is only 14 and won't probably need to worry about mana
regen at all until he starts charming at level 27.
