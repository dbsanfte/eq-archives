okay thanks ...i knew the meter was packet loss but didnt know which was

yes, Win 98 SE


 Do you have the same drivers

yes

  Do you have the same soundcard on both? 

that is not the same for us. not sure what his soundcard is . mine is a
yamaha DS XG.


 Do you have the

yup, we both shut down everything but the explorer, the dial up and the
graphics in the task manager before we go in game.

well i am thinking now that it must be a cooling issue.
when he got the new MB and CPU, the shop had a hard time stabilizing the
heating and had to add the second fan, a 7200rpm 
perhaps they only made it borderline.
but then why would it only happen on EQ and not Diablo or in windows?
I've never dealt with heating issues before , even when I worked in a
shop for awhile.
the symptomology seems right but isn't very consistent....
