	No, I think that what people are saying is that it's OK for newbies
to walk into a newbie zone and start killing mobs that are standing around
even if some high level character is ALSO standing around.  They also seem
to be saying that yes, it would be nice if thet newbies at least asked first
but after all they ARE newbies and the polite honorable and accepted thing to
do is either help them or leave.
