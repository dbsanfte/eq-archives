Hi Dan, thanks for the response. Man, if it can be something as obscure as
that, I may have my work cut out for me finding the problem. If there is one
thing I hate, is making people wait for me while I reboot, or restart. I'm
sure you know the feeling if you had the problem before.

My system is a p4 1400, 32 meg geforce2 gts, 512 ram, sb live, 40gig ata100
hd, 56k modem running window me. Pretty much run of the mill system about 2
months old. If you can think of anything else I could try, I'm all ears.
