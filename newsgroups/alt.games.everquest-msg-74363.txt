When have you seen anything in the tunnel that wasn't pulled there and
still standing over the body of the poor bastard that trained it there?
I don't think I've *ever* seen a mob in that tunnel, nor in the hidden

there. For the most part, the valley and that tunnel always struck me as
perhaps the safest area to go AFK in the whole game.
