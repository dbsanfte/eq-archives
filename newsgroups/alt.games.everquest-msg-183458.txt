Yeah.  That's the next step.  I'm holding out for a bit to see what else
pops up, since what you describe would be mildly tedious.  The other
option is to play a little more with the layers buttons.  If I can get
layer 1 to stay off, then I don't mind having them around.  I'll probably
/bug it tonight if it doesn't work "right".  I don't see why they should
reset every zone...maybe that's as designed, but doesn't hurt to point it
out regardless.
