Well, first of all, buying accounts from others is not only against
the contract you've digitally signed every time you logged into EQ
(Exception being EQ2 and their exchange servers, which haven't started
yet as far as I know). Second of all, there's huge potential to be
scammed doing this. A seller can easily email SOE and have their
password reset to get it back from you after getting the cash and
there wouldn't be a damn thing you could do about it. Lastly, if
actually playing the game doesn't appeal to you...find a new one.
