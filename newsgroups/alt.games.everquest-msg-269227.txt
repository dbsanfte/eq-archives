I found the major problem being poachers; people who aren't willing to
harvest the food/root nodes (very little market for their products) so all
other nodes are replaced with them. They then run about waiting for someone
to do the work, whereupon they reap the harvest, diving in and grabbing as
much as they can. I usually go to the sunken city and the only node type is
food/root. I harvest and destroy, hoping to spawn something better, then i
get swarmed by those parasites. I go away, sickened, come back, and they
have done the whole thing again.

Tier 2 harvesting is much better but you have to be a higher level
adventurer of course, meaning that being a pure artisan doesn't work unless
you have the guy as an alt. The problem is, things like roots should be on
the market in huge crates for a cost per crate (the roots are less than a
copper each so they fall of the market entirely and a lot of food recipes
relied on basil working to make them viable, and they still haven't fixed
that basic ingredient.

If they had allowed offline trading, then perhaps there would be space in
the market for ingredients from the root/food nodes. Until then, they are
ignored by people, who would rather run circles in the zone than actually
harvest/destroy the useless nodes and then benefit from the better
replacements.
