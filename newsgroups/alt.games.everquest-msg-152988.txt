A week is too little.  A month or more is a better idea.  Or maybe a
"permanent" list where the mob can remember so many previous lists.  Meaning
that the mob has to be killed a certain number of times (a large enough
number to prevent farming, say 5?) OR after a long enough time period from
when that list was created.
    This way Group1 kills mob.  Group2 kills mob.  Group3 kills mob.  Group4
kills mob.  Group5 kills mob.  Group6 kills mob & Group1's list is lost from
memory.
    Or say that Group1 kills mob, a week later Group2 kills mob.  2 weeks
pass before Group3 kills mob.  People don't have the time, so nobody fights
(or all attempts fail).  Another 2 weeks go by.  Now it's been 30 days since
Group1 has killed the mob, so they are forgotton about (kind of like staying
mad at someone but eventually getting over it).  The next week Group4 kills
mob, and after the end of the week Group2 is now forgotten about.
    And no port from zone.  How about a no-mana weapon proc type of attack
that fires at random, shooting a blast-wave type of effect from the mob,
blasting the soul from the player's body...in effect a large room-wide AOE
that causes instant death (maybe just show up as a thin transparent wall
expanding outward?) where ever the player is currently standing.  Maybe 3
versions, one is the instant death, another is drain down to 1 HP & 0 mana
(death if already at this point), and last is port to random location in
random nearby zone (maybe up to 3 zones away?) with each player getting
their own random zone & location....maybe to make it more fun, with a random
% of HP & Mana left, with a temporary (random timing, like snare) strength &
durration of debuffer effecting random stat.
    Killing mob = 4-5 weeks on hate list for random attack described above.
    Attempting to kill mob but failing = 2-2.5 weeks on hate list of
stronger damage (say maybe they'll take 10% more damage for each hit for
having been involved earlier).
    Mob hate list memory wipe = Either after # kills, or kill hate list time
runs out.

I like above ideas better.  If part of death squad get (mob randomly decides
which to fire off at them) "death where you stand" spell, "sevearly
weakening" spell, or "random port to random area with random effect of
random strength for random time" spell.

I think attempts should count against you since you did try.  Maybe not near
as strongly, but put yourself in the mob's position.  If someone tried to
fight you but you beat the crap out of them, and they came back to try
again, are you going to fight them just the same or are you more likely to
fight harder with the attitude of "you obviously didn't learn the first
time"?  Though I think that someone who witnesses the killing but did not do
any damage (maybe the guild has someone come along for TV-out effect to
video capture the whole thing) should be looked at as no punishment or maybe
the mob feeling as if "you stand there & let me die, I hate you as if you
tried but failed to kill me", & they get remembered just as if they
attempted to kill the mob but the whole party were wiped out (even if that
really was the case).
