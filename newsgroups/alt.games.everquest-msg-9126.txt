If you don't mind travelling to an out of the way, underused area, you can go
to the Feerott and do skeletons/zombies then lizardmen of varying sizes both in
the forest camps, and then around the entrance to CT for a bunch of those
levels. At least on our sever I found very little competition for mobs, a few
players happy to form groups (and as a cleric, you should have *no* trouble
there) and plentiful creatures to kill.  Loot sucked, but you're looking to
level. Check it out.
