Personal experience is it rarely gets me on the hate list. Doesnt
matter where I"m using it and I use it alot. Hard to say for sure, if
I"m summoned I usually attribute that to the ch I cast immediately
after mor. On the really big mobs its usually resisted but if you can
get it to land it can make a significant difference in a long fight.
