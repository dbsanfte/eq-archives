Ah.....er......NO, not really!   :-)
(or maybe yes, we like it when we Ding another level but it's NOT the
reason we play the game)

Some of us (including several other players I have met) could care less
about actually levelling, except as a side benefit of enjoying the game.

I play the game because I like exploring, seeing new areas, grouping and
chatting with people.  Levelling is strictly a "bonus" that occurs naturally
as I do these things that give me the most fun in the game.  The only time
I actually went out of my way to try and make a new level was when I wanted
to get my Cleric from 33 to 34 quickly, but that was ONLY because I wanted
the better Rez spell to help others with.
