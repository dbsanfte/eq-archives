Be nice to people, it pays off. The sure way to not get a sow is just doing a
/who DRUID and just sending tells out, without knowing if the druid in question
is in the other end of the zone, had a guy thinking it was my duty to come sow
him in the other end of West Karana, and the guy started calling me names when i
didnt feel like stopping my run to Qeynos, using 5 min to get to where he was,
sowing him and use 5 min to run back. Luckily he needed a port when i was on the
way back again, and i could with great satisfaction refuce to port him.
I do sometimes get donations for a sow, and i do accept them, but i never ask
for a donation. Think i might have earned 1 cp for each sow i cast, if im lucky
;-)
If someone need a sow for a corpse run I dont mind going over to them to help,
but i give them a Scale of Wolf instead. Its faster than sow, so if you are
really on a CR i you get there faster, but since i break when you cast/attack
theyll get a nasty surprise if they just claimed to need sow for CR to get a
free one.


Ports is a different matter. After a friend tried to port for donations, and
after 90 min of constant porting only had earned 30pp I stopped porting for
donations. Since i do tradeskills to earn money, and only port when i feel like
it, my prices are generally higher than the average. I take 25pp to port someone
a place where i am going anyway, and 50pp if i have to port them somewhere and
get back to where i was.
If its a newbie i dont mind porting for free if im going there anyway, but a guy
claiming to be a newbie that cannot afford to pay for a port, but are dressed in
a Fungi Tunic have to pay.
