i'm not trying to set up the same config, im trying to set up 2 different
ones

i mean things like this:

my bard uses KP_HOME (numberpad 7) for hotbox_slot_1
but my necro uses  KP_HOME  (numberpad 7) for inventory

if i map KP_HOME to, say, inventory for 1 of my characters, then it is
mapped there for all of them which is what i don't want.

and many different examples
