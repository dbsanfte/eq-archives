Druids get nukes.  Wizard nukes are better, but you can't
put "nukes" here if you only wan things one class gets that
the other doesn't.

You could put "better nukes" but then you'd open up AE
to discussion too...

You could put "more lines of nukes, so its easier to find
a way around resists.

You could put "unresistable nukes"

You could put "manaburn..."

Wizards get mana regen too, that thing where
they stun themselves for ten seconds and fill
up a bunch of their mana bar.  Sadly, it doesn't
scale as they level up, so it gets less and less
useful.

Oh, and they get mana regen via familiar.

And if a druid is available, they can get POTC for
mana regen, which stacks with their own mana regen...
advantage wizard, since POTC won't stack with
someone else's similar mana regen self buff.

Fix this with JBoots or TBoots... which wouldn't be
the same as getting a buff to make up for something.
Later, get Run AA.  Advantage to druid, still, but
not as large as if your wizard was always going to
be unable to move faster than mobs without external
help.

This is only true outdoors, or indoors for a while
after zoning in.

Snare from level one... yes it lets you kite, but snare
is useful for a lot more than just kiting.

Also, single target snare, more mana efficient and/or
safer than AE snare.

Also, long lasting snare starting at level 29

>     Healing and mana regen

Can't put mana regen there really, since both classes
get it.

HP buffs
Str buff
Faction adjusting illusion (not good in all cases, but in some)
Attack buff (wolf form makes many melee do more damage...
particularly useful on marginal melee like clerics)
Resists buffs
Cures

Not putting in items that both have really cripples the wizard side,
who only really benefits from a discussion where you point out
how much better the wizard is at nukes, AE, and PB AE.

Bergh "also has nukes, does this mean you don't count nukes
when comparing wizard to cleric?" Brelltender, 60 cleric, Morell Thule
