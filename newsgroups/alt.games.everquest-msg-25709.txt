Tovax's pet in the Qeynos hills was consistantly dropping 240 silver prior
to the patch. I was thinking "Wow! I guess they really want to make killing
Tovax and his pet a good thing to help out all the newbies that are getting
slaughtered!" A kinder an gentler Verant!

I mean it was nearly perfect! 240 silver was enough that most high levels
would take the time out to toast him and weighs enough that no one would
camp successive spawns! Absolutely brilliant move on Verant's part!

Then I popped him after the patch and picked up nothing; 0.0 .

Reality bites. I don't know what came over me. I'm normally not that into
self delusion.
