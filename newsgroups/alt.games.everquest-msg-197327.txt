I was extremely close to that point myself.  I go LFG, within 5 minutes I 
have several tells asking me to come to PoV/PoS, no flag.  I eventually got 
dragged through the trials when the one 65 ranger in our guild called in a 
friend from an uber guild, a 65 SK with a couple hundred or so AA to be the 
MA.  It was not that my guild could not get a group through the trials, it 
was just that swapping out any one person in the group for a shaman meant 
they could not make it, or, at the very least, made it become an extremely 
iffy proposition dependant on lucky spawns during the trial.
