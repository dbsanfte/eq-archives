Okay... now the equation gets even more interesting...

However, a 57.6 report indicates that the modem driver does not contain the
proper result code for the actual handshake speed and is reporting the port
speed instead. It's likely an X2 or flex driver which needs to be updated to
provide proper v.90 rate reports. If the modem handshakes @ 43666 but here's
no result code in the driver, it will report it as a 57600 or 115200 or
whatever the port is set at. Look through the .inf file and make sure it has
ALL proper v.90 rates listed. Any that are missing will report the port
speed if that's the speed it connects at. Also, 33.6 is actually a v.34+
connect rate and thus would be reported correctly even by an X2 or Flex
driver.
