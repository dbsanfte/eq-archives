I wrote an article for my guild at one time on how to do this, I post it 
below for your information. Unfortunately, it may not translate perfectly 
because there's a step that requires copying and pasting a non-printing 
character that may or may not be displayed correctly here in this message. 
As I read it here while I compose, it appears to come out ok; the special 
character looks like a box, or a square. But I can't say how your newsreader 
or OS is going to interpret it. If it comes out looking garbled, probably 
can't help you further. Good luck.

======== Start of post on how to embed links in chat =============
The following technique can be used to incorporate item links into your 
hotkeys, so that  messages can actually contain more information for the 
viewer, linkable and unobtrusive, but communicative. Using these links, 
players can actually see links to the spells referenced by your messages, so 
that they can better understand what you're actually casting. This 
information was pieced together from various sites and experimentation. Most 
of the credit goes to Shaman (yay) Gangaskan Gnollbasher on Torv, whose post 
on the Crucible site was the first I read on the topic.

Step 1: Make a hotkey and give it a recognizable name, like Linktest. Give 
it some kind of /say text like "/say I have SLOWED %t."

Step 2: In your EQ folder, find the file named 
[YourCharacterName]_[ServerName].ini. So, for example, my file was 
Winterfury_Firiona.

Step 3: Open the above file in Notepad and find the hotkey you made. You'll 
see the text next to the hotkey that's labeled by page number, line, etc. 
You will be editing this text.

Step 4: Your hotkey will start with some kind of /say or /g, /rs, whatever. 
The rest of the text will consist of whatever you would ordinarily put in a 
hotkey message, but will include a snazzy new link. The link you will create 
consists of four parts:

a) an opening "box" character (hex 0x12);

b) an item code;

c) a label; and

d) a closing "box" character.

The result should look something like this:

/g0026915-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001C7442067 MALOS on ---> %t in 4.3 
seconds ...

Note the opening /g makes this a group message. Following this is the 
required "box" character which denotes the start of the item link, followed 
by the item code, the label (" MALOS"), and finally the end "box", followed 
by the rest of the hotkey message. The text that you put between the last 
number of the item code and the closing "box" character (in this case 
 "MALOS") is the label and is the pink text that people will see as a link 
in the message.

Step 5: Save As . the file and make SURE that you select UTF-8 encoding in 
the bottom drop down. This is the format required to be read by EverQuest 
and is the only way that this will work.

Step 6: Once the file is saved you'll need to reload it into EQ in one of 3 
ways: 1) restart EQ; 2) zone; or 3) type /load ui (this is fastest). You can 
alt-tab out to edit the file in Notepad, re-enter and just /load ui.

Ok how do you get the item codes and how do you make that little box 
character?  Every item in EverQuest has an item code and it's accessible 
using a simple technique. Send a ;t to an item, and EQ will return a message 
saying it "Can't find player xxx." where xxx. is the item code. Simple, huh? 
So, typing ;t followed by a link to an item will get you that item's item 
code. It's just like sending a tell to someone but sending it to an item 
instead of a player.

The box is not so simple, I'm not sure that there is a way to natively 
create a hex 0x12 character in Notepad but fortunately you can just copy and 
paste it right from the example above. Some forums do not properly display 
the box character, which is why I created this document (Word knows how to 
print the box).

That does it. Let me know if you have any questions about this technique or 
suggested improvements. I get a great variety of responses to these messages 
in my groups, ranging from "Ahhh, so THAT's what Cripple does" to "Wow, your 
HAXXORS ROXXORS my BOXXORS". It's always neat when a fun technique turns out 
to have some nice utility as well.
