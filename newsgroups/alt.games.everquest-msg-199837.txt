I'm in the early 40s with my beastlord, which is only my second EQ
character. Not having done much grouping with him I guess is why I only just
learned here that my warders can use items! D'OH!!! I guess it never occured
to me that the tiger could wield stuff. You know, it's a _cat_ toon, that
whole opposable-thumb thing....Anyway I'd love some help with some "Warder
101" type questions:

a) What happens to weapons/armor that I give to the warder when the warder
dies (either literally, or because I log or zone)? Does it matter whether
the stuff is no-drop or not?

b) As far as the warder improving its weap skills, how persistent is that?
Does for example the lvl39 warder keep improving its 1HB skill persistently
until I get to lvl49 and start using that new warder? Does the lvl49 warder
then start with all skills at zero? At my own skill levels? Something else?

c) Very cool that the warder can dual wield! Roughly what caliber of weapons
[dmg/dly] would make the lvl39 warder get more DPS than it does without
weapons?

d) How do I check on the warder's skills, is there a slash command for that?

Thanks in advance!
