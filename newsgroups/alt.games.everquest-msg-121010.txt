The rest of us had to pay to find out if the world of Norrath was right for
us, so I don't think you will find many people here sympathetic to your
cause. The customer service folks have a lot of incoming emails they have to
worry about, you should give them more than three days, not to mention your
email makes you sound like a whining brat. If you are in such a hurry to see
what Norrath has to offer, you should plunk down the 10-15 USD for the game
(the first month is free if you do this).

Where did you download this "free trial" from? Most of the MMORPGs that I
know of offering these still require a valid credit card number to be
supplied upon activation of the trial account. I have not heard of EQ giving
one, so I don't know the specifics. Were you given a free account activation
key? This is probably what you need to get started, go back to where you
downloaded the software and read the text accompanying the download.
