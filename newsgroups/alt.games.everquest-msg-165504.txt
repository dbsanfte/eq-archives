It appears you lacked the appropriate reading comprehension skills
to understand what I wrote, Martin.  I'll try to make it clear, so
that your tiny brain can grasp it.

I *did* say:
"If you have no life, you have 12+ hours to sit at a camp."

I did *not* say:
"If you have 12+ hours to sit at a camp, you have no life."

Let me know if that didn't make things clear for you.  I'll try to
use even smaller words.
