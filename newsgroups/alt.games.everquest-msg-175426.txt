Well, it's an outdoors zone with loot, and thus absolute Druid heaven. 
I've only died there once, and that was in the caves (and due to a 
linkdeath), and I've made more money that I've seen in my life before. 
Of course, at 55 it was a struggle to find enough blues, and at 56 it's 
plain not worth it, but all in all it's the best zone I've ever hunted 
in.
