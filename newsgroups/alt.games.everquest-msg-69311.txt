>>I agree, but it still puts Barbs behind the two races with Regen.

It is very noticable for a Hybrid class they gets Ranger level heals,
and can only equip leather (better items won't be obtainable until at
least the mid-30s)

It is STILL a handicap and a negative feature when comparing BL races.
verfrost Peaks newbie area tops out around level 5.

Orc Mountaineers/Shamans mixed in with Troopers/Cats/Spiders.
Wandering IceBone Skels immune to non-magic weapons (and BL pets below
lvl15). 

 >the other quests in the Halas/Qeynos area for more xp, as mentioned.

The quests are nice, but they involve travel and multiple zonings.
Also your skills will not raise while you are running around.

>>Compare that to the starting areas of the other BL races.

Once you learn them Innothule and Feerrott are great zones. Plenty of
mobs, and you can hunt till your 40s with ease within 2-3 zones.

Your opinion and mine obviously differs, and I respect that.

As far as faction goes, with Luclin it is a non-issue. With the Nexus
portals you have the Bazaar with banks, vendors, tradeskills, etc as
well as the new cities on the moon which are not KoS to evil
races/classes. It has never been easier to be evil.

Cheers
