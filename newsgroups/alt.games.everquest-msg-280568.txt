At well under 50 cents per GB, hard drive space is just too inexpensive 
these days to be an issue. I easily have 4GB to spare for a second copy, 
thus eliminating any need to worry about it at all. 

Besides, you mention window settings in addition to the graphics, models 
and sound settings to which I was referring. Sounds like an awful lot of 
trouble to both go through the game options at the login screen as well as 
re-tweak your window settings once you get logged each time. /shrug
