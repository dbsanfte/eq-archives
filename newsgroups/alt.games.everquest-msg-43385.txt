Hi all, thanks for the advice  : )

I'll try again, but I am 'fairly' sure that he is popping in the DE camp on
MT, by the time I get to the camp, he hasn't shown up on track, I sit there
a min, then he appears on track, (which I am constanty doing btw) at which
point he is in the camp, and I ain't seen him wander past....  or run.
Maybe this is broken on MT?    Like I said, I'll check again.

Failing that, I'll beg the guild to help splat the DE camp, that will make
life easier and safer I suppose anyway, I just like the feeling of
accomplishment I get when I do something all by myself in EQ. You know how
it goes...  That big grin, that ya just can't wipe off : )       (hope that
isn't just me...  LOL)

Thanks again for the tips and advice folks.

Most appreciated : )

Oh aye.......while on the subject of quests, <grins>  my Ranger's arm slot
has still got banded in, the last 'really' crap bit of armour  : )    I was
thinking of getting the Ivy arms. I beat on Grimfeather a few days ago with
a bud and got the Rune of Ivy, np. But...... for some reason, I have managed
to miss out on SolA in all my hunting, so never been there and no idea what
the place is like, any advice on getting the heart of fire (if thats what
they call it, can't remember, but got it written down...some where), will it
be simple for me?, should I just shout and offer to pay to loot one? etc
etc, any advice gratefully accepted  : )

Thanks once again for all the help.
