Actually, it's routine for LDoN pickup groups on Tunare.  But I
suspect that many people don't like it.  They don't speak up as
they are afraid of being perceived as "greedy" if they do.  All
I know is that on the rare occasions that I start a group I say
something like "Any who want can random on augments, no more
than one per customer, please don't roll if it isn't useful.
All droppables are random at the end to any who want them as
they aren't worth all that much and we all probably have better
anyway." which nobody has yet had an issue with.  I just wish I
had been in the group with a Rogue who claimed NBG on droppable
legs that were inferior to what he was wearing (he insisted the
+DEX on them would be an improvement) and then when the looter
tried to give them to him the trade was auto-cancelled due to
duplicate LORE item.
