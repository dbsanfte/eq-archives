Thats been the situation for quite some months now.

"an" eq pvp experience...

What were you still doing there?

Typical of most of the server away from blatantly obvious areas that a
pk would pick.

I would guess they were level 10, doesnt make sense to have a level 6 pk
char.

Thats a big problem at low levels, I agree. However its not like you
have been denied the right to do it too.

As for it being an "exploit", no. They can't code it so that damage you
don't do gives you looting rights, especially seeing as how now only the
person who gets the slain message can loot the corpse. If 5 people are
attacking someone and they pull a hp ring, who gets to loot?

Still wondering why you are hanging around...

Most high level buffs last longer than 20 minutes, especially the hp
buffs.

You aren't good enough. I know people who haven't levelled past 16 and
are decked out with full sets of bd jewellery and the such, because they
can do what you can't - kill twinks.

Don't take it personally, but most people really don't have what it
takes to PvP and win almost all the time. Just like you'll find that one
chanter who is *perfect* at what they do in PvE, yet you'll find others
who spend their days getting their group killed repeatedly and bitching
about how enchanters are fucked etc etc.

Thats very correct. Make sure you KILL THEM. Everyone will die in PvP at
some point, *everyone*....remember that.

Player vs Player? Sounds like it to me.

There's no requirement the person has to fight back.

So you were having a "decent time"? What was all the bitching for then?
:p

And if those people don't like it they can go back to E'ci....

You don't even know what PvP means...how could you identify it?

PvP = Player vs Player. Says nothing about whether the person is running
or whatnot.

I do enjoy good fights against people who know wtf they are doing, but
after years on RZ I've realized most people just don't know what the
fuck they are doing.

Of course its a cheapshot. The only reason people would claim otherwise
is to get you all annoyed. Personally I could care less about gloating
unless the person is bugging me. If I come across someone on low hp then
of course I'm going to kill them, if I see them while they are on low
health then they are just extremely unlucky or they are medding in the
wrong spot. Some people will just take it on the chin and go on with
their eq day, others will just bitch and moan until I just eventually
have to go "owned~" and then put them on /ignore.

But who says he actually cared? You seem to be under the impression that
every PvP incident should be the centre of everyones world. PvP doesn't
just mean full blown combat where both want to kill each other. I often
bug naked people because they don't wear any gear, if that wizzie wants
to wear full carmine and nothing droppable thats fine, I'll just leave
him to heal 800hp at sitting down regen rates :p

It's good isn't it? I would hate to think what its like on one of those
servers where they get along the lines of 2200+ people in peak times....

hehe yeah, there are quite a few beggars at banks and the
such....although they don't go far from banks/newbie zones.

Now now, remember this is the net. Real life is pretty much irrelevant.

PvP changes a LOT with levels.

Yeah I picked up 54 after only a mere week of levelling every day :(

You take it so seriously though.

You just wrote like 2 pages on how much PvP sucks on RZ, how it isn't
fair, how there are exploiters etc etc, but the game isn't significant?
