Both come from the same quest 
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2420) which can be 
bought (it's a no-fail combine of several non-no-drop items) for 7-8k on 
many servers.

First you get Xanthes, then you can turn it back in and get Solstice 
instead, if FT1 is more your thing. 

Personally, I'd stock up on Druid clickys (The ES stuff, etc) for mana-free  
fighting. Then again, my druid retired at 35, so I may be way off base.
