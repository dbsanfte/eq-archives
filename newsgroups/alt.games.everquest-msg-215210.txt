Yes.  Making Rogue Hide/Sneak work on undead was part of the first
round of class balancing (i.e. making Rogues and hybrids functional)
years ago.  It was highlighted in the patch message when it occured.
I don't recall if it was before, after, or at the same time as they
added Evade (Rogues used to use Backstab as a deliberate taunt to
save casters, it was not useful for consistent damage as the Rogue
often died immediately thereafter).
