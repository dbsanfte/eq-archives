I know about the GM/guide approval process for names, and, yes, it is
true. Just seemed to me that the one I asked about was obvious enough
that even the crude auto-filter shoulda caught it. While I'm on the
subject of stupidest names, a few more pop to mind:

Fallus
Miow Mixx
Nyne Lyves (Guess what race these two were?)
Happo Marks
Panteraa

Not necissarily stupid, but kinda oiy: Panther Rehtnap
