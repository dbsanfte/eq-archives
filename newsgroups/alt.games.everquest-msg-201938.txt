They actually state in several places there the answer.  Yes, you can 
always get a skillup so long as your actual skill level (not modified) is 
below the trivial level for the item you are combining.

You next question is moot, as the answer to the first was yes.

In particular, with smithing, Monual posted that he used a +15% 
blacksmithing item to allow him to skillup on a PoP item that has a trivial 
level that is lower than the minimum level required to attempt the combine.  
Etherial rings I think?  Would have to look it up to be certain of the 
item.
