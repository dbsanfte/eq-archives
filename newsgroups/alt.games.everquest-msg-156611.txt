What about the people 60 and under?  My guild's most frequently on Clerics
are 60, the most frequently on Enchanter is 60, the most frequently on
Warriors are 60.  It will suck if they ding 61, and can't get XP in the
places most of the 54-57ish people want to go.  Unless PoP has a lot of
content that is high enough for 61+ while still being good for a group that
is mostly in the 55-57ish range, this is going to really screw up many
guilds in the 52-60 range.
