That level 50 something warrior cannot do much of what you listed
alone, and if he does survive he will have a LOT of down time healing.
Some people like the independance that lower levels offer. You can
also argue that high levels give you even more independance. It's all
about perception.

At level 1 a Warrior hits 3 buttons (Taunt, Kick, Auto-Attack). At
level 50 he hits 3-4 buttons (Taunt, Kick, Auto-Attack, Bash/Disarm)
and occasionally triggers a discipline.

Fun is relative. The game plays the same for both the level 1 and the
level 50. The level 50 can go more places unmolested and has more
skills, but the kill-loot-sell and exp grind is the same.

I am merely pointing out that the "atmosphere" may change, but the
game mechanics do not. People that never level above 20 are playing
the same game "mechanically" as a level 60.

I think it is fantastic that you have found the level range in EQ that
you enjoy the most. Just don't be surprised if other players prefer
different level ranges for different reasons.
