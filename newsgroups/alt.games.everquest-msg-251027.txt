Ah, I see.  Perhaps it just wasn't technologically feasible, or doable
from a business perspective (too expensive?).  Or perhaps it was a stop-
gap measure until the Amiga came out.

Not every company has the overwhelming resources Microsoft has.  In
addition, at the time, the home computer industry was still pretty young.
It could be that they simply didn't know better, not that they knowingly
and willingly tried to screw you.

It would have been nice if the Amiga had come with a C64 emulator.  For
what it's worth, I upgraded from C64 to A500 myself.  When it comes to
applications like spreadsheets, though, I think it's the responsiblity of
the app company to make import/export tools available so you can
reasonably get data into and out of other tools and applications.

I think a lot of what you're describing was just a happy accident that
Windows happened to be based on DOS in the beginning.  By the time that
era passed (WinXP, as far as home users are generally concerned), MS was
so fabulously wealthy they could afford to spend lots of time and money
making sure things were backwards compatible.

CD-ROM is read-only.  Unless you have the machinery to press CD-ROMs
in your house.  :)
