This is an interesting point.  I have never even *played* with you and I'm
frustrated.  Is there *anything* about EQ that you *DO* like?  You haven't
mentioned anything good about it yet.  This game is what you make it.  You join
a group and bitch and whine and you are right, they are going to get frustrated
and quit playing with you.  If I want bitching and whining I'll hang out at
work :)
