Not really...  There was a complaint about the EQ Devs only taking up
people who ran their computers openly to them, or otherwise unsafe to
the Internet, to which I responded with...  Well, to play EQ you must
allow the EQ Devs to freely check parts of your computer whenever they
want.  Seems logical to me, and I have the feeling that with the other
online games from Sony they take the same thing in mind with checking
parts of your computer and system information for hacks.

Though, I've heard stated that the EQ Devs say that they don't care
what your computer stats are to apply for beta in all truth.  Perhaps
they're looking for the people with the best systems to qualify first. 
For some reason, though, I was able to bypass this ActiveX button.  I
was doing the application at work and it asked me to download the
ActiveX program, to which I turned down.  When I got home to finish
filling out the application it didn't take me to that spot again.
