Maybe, maybe not. While I think EQ does get a significant boost for 
being the first big 3D MMORPG, I don't think that is enough to keep it 
in the lead anymore. After all, had SWG not been an utter piece of 
grinding crap, it could have easily dethroned EQ. As could (potentially) 
WoW, Matrix Online or Middle Earth Online. I honestly don't think any of 
those three, except *maybe* WoW, really have a chance to given the fact 
that no one is really getting creative with game play (except maybe CoH).

Let me clarify here. It isn't the loot itself that keeps me going, it is 
the quest *for* the loot that does. Subtle distinction, but important. 
In a MMORPG, I enjoy the sense of adventure, of purpose and immersion. 
For example, as a newbie Paladin I've recently finished my Truthbringer 
Armor quest. What I enjoyed was the process of tracking down the correct 
  creatures, finding the rare drops, and then building the equipment. It 
wasn't the equipment that really got me excited. As another example, I 
did the sharkskin shield quest, even though the item itself it totally 
useless (and worth less than the 2 shark skins I collected had I sold 
them separately). But, I wanted to explore, I wanted to see where the 
sharks were and it was a fun quest by my standards. *That* is what I 
want in a game. CoH doesn't offer that in any real way. Once you're run 
around a zone for 10 minutes, you've seen it all. Every quest you get 
sends you to some standard layout-type building/sewer/cave. They ALL 
look the same, they all have the same basic mobs in them. They're 
basically all cootie-cutter versions of themselves. In the end, I find 
that dull. Especially considering the fact that while your there you get 
*nothing* but XP for the effort. You're not collecting items (I don't 
count enhancements) or anything, you just kill everything and leave.

Not only those but: Matrix Online, Middle Earth Online and D&D Online. 
However, given the type of game play CoH offers compared to the other 
"standard" MMORPGs, it will likely settle with its own little niche of 
players. The question is, will that niche be large enough to sustain the 
game? Who knows. AC2 has been kept alive with abysmal subscription 
numbers, but I think that's as much a technology test as anything at 
this point.

Just FYI, the loot in AC is basically random. There were very few 
standard type items (they were mostly quest based items). The randomness 
is what made AC's combat so fun. You could hunt for hours because you 
really never knew what you'd get. What's more, you may get some set of 
boots that had awesome magic on it, or, totally useless, just depended 
on your character and needs. It, in my opinion, was the absolute best 
loot system I've seen.
