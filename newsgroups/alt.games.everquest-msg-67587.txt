I guess it really depends on the system configuration and the scale of teh
upgrade.  A couple years back, I was running a P100.  I had recently
upgraded the motherboard because the old one wouldn't support anything
bigger than a 2GB hard-drive, and I'd just bought 6 gigs.  A few months
after that, Baldur's Gate came out and I tried running it on the P-100.  It
ran, but in a slow, dream-like way.  So I upgraded the processor to a P233
MMX, which cost me about $80 at the time.  Well worth it, in my opinion, and
perfectly reasonable, since it was just the processor.  All my other games
at the time ran fine on the P100.
