An extreme example being used to illustrate the point, but the point
is still valid. Simply adding an emoticon isn't always enough.
Especially the one in question, which can easily be interpreted as
taunting rather than "Hey, I'm just kidding!".

Now, I agree that the deguilding was a bit extreme, but he didn't
exactly react well in the situation. When a guild leader admonishes
you for acting inappropriately, you don't respond with "bite me!",
joking or no.
