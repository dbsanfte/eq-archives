Since I really didn't understand the point of your response unless you're
just saying that it's perfectly ok to turn off guild chat whenever you want,
I snipped it and am going with that conclusion.

A strong guild communicates.  There are 4 ways of communicating that I can
think of:
- Message boards/newsgroup:  far and away the best way except for the
unfortunate fact that very few people bother reading it.
- mailing list: almost as good, but, again, not a lot of people tend to read
that mailbox.
- /guildmotd:  excellent but limited
- /guildsay: worst of the four but the only one online people WILL see...if
they don't shut themselves off from the guild.

If you can't be bothered to skim the blather from the communications (it
ain't that hard) then you're not an asset to the guild and should be kicked
out unless you read the boards/mail religiously.
