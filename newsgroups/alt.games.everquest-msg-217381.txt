The only thing my lvl 43 warrior desires in a dungeon is a cleric.  If a
cleric is not avail, he'll take anyone who has reasonable heal... that's it.
Otherwise, he'll group with anyone - no matter class, as long as the player
knows how to play the class - and do any LDoN in any location.  He just
want's to fight with good team and win the occassional augementation roll!

He's always happy to add any class to a group...  he HATES standing around
while people argue "well, we really should get a chanter..."  and he's happy
to group with anyone in other zones... even if there's not a healer to be
seen!

He figures that he's got to do the "warrior med" to heal up anyways... at
least there's someone to talk to...

Holler if you see him and are interested!
