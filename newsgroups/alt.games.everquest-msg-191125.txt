Trade in the tusks 4 at a time to the Othmir leader and he gives you a
random gem. You might get a blue diamond, or you might get a silver
ring. :p If you're getting 50p per ulthork tusk, I'd suggest you just
sell them in the bazaar... I've gotten screwed by that little otter
too many times on Bulthar trunks. 

By the way, quadding Bulthars in CS (As long as the herd leader isn't
up) might be doable at your level... it's great exp, but they have a
TON of HPs and will shred you if they get ahold of you... I'm pretty
sure you can single pull them at about 44... Or do wyverns in the same
zone... less HPs and more plentiful... just don't pull Yvolcam... He &
the herd leader can't be snared...
