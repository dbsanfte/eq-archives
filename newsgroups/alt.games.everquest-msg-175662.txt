I'm sorry, would you look at what he said again?  He said

If you had a bard and no enchanter/shaman (or 60+BL), 15% is not
the highest bard haste.  At level 50 it's 30% + Melody of Ervaj
(5-15%)  At 56 it's 45% + Battlecry of the Vah Shir.  For like
leveled people with 41% haste item (think epiced ranger/bl/
rogue) a bard can take take them to their haste cap and beyond.  Since he
casually mentions 41% haste items, which aren't available until
the 50's, then he can't go around using the mid 30's bard haste
song.  If he *IS* talking about he 36 bard song (15%) then he'd
better learn what the cap is that low (much lower than the 100+%
he indicates)

I never said you shouldn't use shaman haste where available - hell,
if that's the only spell haste availabe to the group he'd better
be casting it - or leave.

I did say that yanking numbers out of his ass destroyed the credibility
of his argument.  A Mid-high 50's melee with 41% item haste can easily
be taken to the haste cap (85% at that level) by ONE level 56 bard
song.

But given a group with a bard and a shaman, I sure wouldn't have the
bard wasting a song in his twist on the non-stacking haste.  Of course
my biggest problem in groups with shaman has always been convincing
them not to waste mana casting Celerity on my pet.
