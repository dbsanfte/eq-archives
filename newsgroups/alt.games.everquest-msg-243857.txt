...  I did...  "Macroquest".  It's the one that's been the hot-topic for the
past year or so, though I've only seen it mentioned a few times by name in the
newsgroup here.  Google-groups shows that other than your faq threads,
eqmacros has only been mentioned once in the past year in this group and
not much more in the past two years, most of those in the prior rendition
of the faq.

Indeed.
