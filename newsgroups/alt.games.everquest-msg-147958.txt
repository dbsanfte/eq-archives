For those advertising companies which have a one pixel image in
e-mails which, when opening the mails, forces a connection to the
internet I place that URL into an application that I have written and
then run it.

What happens is that overnight that site gets over a quarter of a
million hits.   This then ought to screw up someone's accounting.

Ditto with scumware.  If I can locate the advertiser's URL, which
pays, then he too gets a quarter of a million readers each night.
Hopefully, they have to pay one tenth of a US cent for each 'read'.

My way of fighting back rather than just using AdAware.
