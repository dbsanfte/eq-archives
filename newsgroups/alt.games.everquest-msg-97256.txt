Uhm...that's a perfect example of why this boost is a good thing.  The
first druid DOT is flame lick, at level 1, which at level 1 does 8
points of damage over 8 ticks.  That goes up, toping out at 24 points
over 8 ticks.  This can basically be ignored as a DOT (it is also a
debuff, which is worthwhile).  The second DOT is at level 14 (Stinging
Swarm).  So, no root and DOT until level 14.

Snare kiting works from level 1, but with limited mana pool and
inefficient nukes, it doesn't become effective until later.  It's not
really good until 14 (Expulse Summoned) for summoned mobs, or 19
(Careless Lightning) in general.

It isn't until around 14 that a Druid really starts to play like Druid.
Before that, it is still mostly melee...the Druidishness comes from
damage shields and Harmony.

Speeding up 1-10 will let people who want to play Druids get to where
they can actually do Druidish stuff faster, which I see as a good thing.
Same for other classes.  Hybrids are just Warriors with a trick or two,
until 9, when they start to get magic.
