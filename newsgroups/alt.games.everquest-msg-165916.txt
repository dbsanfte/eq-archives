Funny thing; I was playing DAoC for a while and the naming there was *far*
worse than what I've seen on EQ, it was just amazing. Apparently they make
almost no effort to police names. I kept a list of really bad names and gave
up somewhere around 50.

I finally did petition some guy named "Killapriest".
