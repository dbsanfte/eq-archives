This post inspired me to try similar methods in WoW with my Hunter.  On
paper we have the perfect tools:

1)  Feign Death - same as EQ
2)  Ice Trap - a trap that locks the victim in a block of ice for about
30 seconds

The plan was to lay a trap, shoot the mob and as soon as it (or one of
its friends) gets stuck in the ice do the feign death and it's friends
leave it behind for me to kill it in it's own.

Attempt 1:  shoot the mob, it stands there and casts a spell at me -
ok, it doesn't work on casters unless you have a way to leave their LOS
 :)

Attempt 2:  all looks to be going good - 2 run over and one gets
trapped.  I FD and the trap disappears straight away!  Looks like
Blizzard have thought about this and stopped it from happening -
spoilsports!  :(

I was hoping to solo a group quest using this technique - no joy there
though.
