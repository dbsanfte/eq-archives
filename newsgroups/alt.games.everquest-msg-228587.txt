Because hopefully somone I'm guilded with will stop killing me, and help 
me not get killed. A necro by himself is a good killing machine... 6 of 
them together in a world of soloers... they'd be unstoppable. I'll bet 
there will be guilds... besides lots of people like attaching themselves 
  to something bigger especially when they have no hope of winning on 
their own... after all some twits going to play it 60+ hours a week... 
while others are going to play it 6 hours a week... who's going to rack 
up more kills...

Its 'unfair' at the outset... insofar as at least in quake fragfests you 
can reasonably expect to be present for the same amount of a battle as 
the next person... since they usually last only minutes.

Yeah it makes a wee difference :)... has the 'race' align thing been 
sorted out yet?
