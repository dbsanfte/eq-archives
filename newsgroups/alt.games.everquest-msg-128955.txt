*flamebait Warning!* Sorry folks I was in the mood....

Yes. Man/humanity/people whatever, all drive from the same logic patterns.
People don't decide one day, Hey I'll blow myself up and kill a grandmother
and a baby (always use the most dramatic factoid...why don't you throw in
that they eat children and have lunch with Hussein?). Hey they learned that
from you! Remember dear Begin blowing up the King David Hotel in...what?
1947? Please explain why your terrorism is Patriotism and another's is Evil.

Even F'ing Jeffrey Dalmer "thought" he was doing the right thing. So did
Atta. Now if you can't see why these people are driven to do the things they
do, then It is YOUR fault. And ironically, when we lose 3 mil to the nuke,
its going to be your whiny Israeli ass saying,  "See I told you." (and just
like 9/11, you will probably have info, but will let it happen to teach the
US about terrorism),  and yet it was being your ally that killed them.

But you better start recognizing what the hell has got them so pissed off
that they will strap C4 to themselves and kill. If you can't, one day
America will wake up and not bail your ass out. But go ahead, keep blowing
up their buildings, taking away their property and liberties, you have
enough people paid off in the US you can do whatever the hell you want. So
go build a big ass wall, mine the hell out of it and blow away anyone
without a yarmulke. Oh but wait, you need them for their cheap labor....

Israel took the WB, GS, and GH in 67 thinking that you could extract a land
for peace deal from all sides. Then you want to divert the waters of the
Jordan and deny them of enough water to prosper, AND you want them to give
up any rights of control on the third most sacred site in Islam.

Hell you got Sharon, just gather them up all in a camp and do what you know
and do best. You all did it in Lebanon and Jenin. And you had it done to you
in Auschwitz, Dachau and Treblenka (sic). Are you only going to happy when
you even the numbers?
