Quest some of the crafted.  It's cheaper than buying it, generally.
The crafted quest gives great EXP even into the 30s.
  
See what else you can get from hunting.  You mentioned an AC leather
neck piece; get an orc fang necklace AC5.  They are lore so often sold
by someone planning to go back.  There are other items you can get
from various dungeons at your level that are better than banded.
