The modifier was :

Levels 1-29 = 1
30-34 = 1.1
35-39 = 1.2
40-44 = 1.3
45-50 = 1.4
51 = 1.5
52 = 1.6
53 = 1.7
54 = 1.9
55 = 2.1
56 = 2.3
57 = 2.5
58 = 2.7
59 = 3.0
60 = 3.1

Looking at hell levels in terms of how much harder they were than 
previous levels (Percentage of xp required for previouslevel) :
44 = 104% (Normal level)
45 = 228% (Hell level)
46 = 51%  ("Pain level" as death xp costs about twice as much)
47 = 104% (normal level)
48 = 104%
49 = 104%
50 = 104% (this is a "normal" level)
51 = 232% (Hell level)
52 = 108% (No pain, so this is just a continuing pain)
53 = 108% (Still pain)
54 = 163% (Double pain )
55 = 109% (Double pain continues)
56 = 108%
57 = 108%
58 = 108%
59 = 140% (treble pain)
60 = 60%   (Ahh back to noraml-ish, compaired to 50 this is still pain)

As Lance said they did not change the amount of xp needed per level they 
added a fudge factor. Basically in some levels kills are worth more xp 
than others.
For example in 54 and 59 killing an even con (in the same zone) will get 
you more xp than at 53,55,58 or 60.
Effectivly this means that the number of kills required per level is 
smother.

Before the smoothing 59 would take aboout 500 (solo) blue cons in a 
normal zone, while 58 only took about 350 (solo) blue kills.

Unfortunatly I don't have any really good figures post smoothing, but 
you can assume that both 58 and 59 now take nearer to 400 kills, 59 will 
  still take a little more, but not 50% more.

See above
