has anything else changed since EQ worked apart from changing to XP? ... I'm
running XP Pro, along with a large number of others I guess, and there's no
problem. In fact it doesn't even need to be installed ... just run
everquest.exe from the folder ... XP doesn't need to know a thing about it
:).

I can only think it may be your router or maybe Verizon blocking the ports
that EQ uses to communicate with the servers.
