I think this seriously depends on what you are fighting and where you are
fighting.  As my High Elf Enchanter has learned...  From 14 to 16, I was
able to do some soloing in Crushbone, taking the occasional Orc Lego,
sometimes with charm to have another orc do the dirty work, or use the 12th
level Animation pet with strength and mist on it, then weaken, choke and a
toss in of Chaotic Feedback while meleeing with the pet.

I didn't do a lot of stunning, mostly because stunning would work best when
you have lots of people pounding on it, not just the animation.

My load out at the time was Lesser Shielding, Mist, Strengthen, Enfeeble
Strength, Choke, Chaotic Feedback, Mesmerize, Soothe.  Mesmerize when you
have too many coming in, which comes in handy when you need to space out
your fight, Sooth to do single pulls.  Use the Animation as a buffer, not
as your main tank, so that when you need to drop the nuke, you can pull
back without interruption.

I am currently 21 in Oasis now, using the following Tactics:

Languid Pace (Level 16), Sanity Warp (Level 16), Quickness on pet (Level
20), with indispersed meleeing when health allows it and the pet isn't
getting whacked too hard.  While the Crocs of Oasis hit hard, with a stick
of Languid Pace, it doesn't hit as often because it doesn't attack as often
as it would witout Languid Pace.  The 16th Level Animation can stand up a
little better to the pounding of lower level crocs, but shouldn't be used
as a tank until 20th.  Higher level Crocs should be left alone, unless you
want to try the stunning method, but I wouldn't count on it too much
myself.

Group wise... I would focus on the following:

Languid Pace incoming mobs.  Mez adds, Quickness your own melee people then
med.  Enchanters in groups tend more to be utility than direct conflict.
Which means, Crowd Control and Buffing.  Nuking should be last resort,
especially in a crowd situation.  Melee players will depend heavily on the
Haste, as it will allow them to throw out more attacks per minute, the
Languide Pace will help the melee people as to not get attacked as often,
thus less damage to the tanks over all time.  If you have a chance to throw
out weaken or choke, that is great, but if you have good, hasted melee
players, it won't last long.  Being able to Mez adds will help also, as it
won't cause the group to scatter as much and try and focus on one objective
instead of 2 or more.

Reasons why not be in direct conflict:

Mezzing adds will create Agro.  Languid Pace will create some agro.  Being
a caster, your hitpoints is not as great as a tank, and throwing in a nuke
won't help, especially if the tank is trying to get it off you.
