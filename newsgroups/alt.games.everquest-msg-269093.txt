I play on Brell Serilis and oddly enough the times I've been KS and
witnessed others do it have been rare.  I must have been lucky as
well.  :o)  I'm not saying I doubt you, but I'm just as surprised
reading about the barrage of obscenities as you were reading about KS
being solved with discussion.  I swear, my KS discussions have gone
something like this:

Me: Hey man, I was fighting that mob and you just stole my kill.

KSer: Oh really.  I'm sorry.  I did not see you there.

Me: No problem.

Most of the times someone has stolen my kill has been in outdoor zones
were I was on the other side of some hill and a higher level PC on the
other side of the hill cast enough spells on it to do more damage.

Man, that would really piss me off if someone did that deliberately
and repeatedly.  I guess I really have been lucky.
