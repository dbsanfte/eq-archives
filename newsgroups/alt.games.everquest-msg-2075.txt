Go to everfrost, group and kill mammoths. The tusks are worth a good bit.
I'm talking about the momma's too, not the calfs.

Option two, get a STRONG group (i.e. you are the lowest, the rest up into
low 30's) and kill hill giants. These big beasts carry a fair amount of
coin.

Third option, get a group and go into SplitPaw. Those gnolls drop small coin
(5pp or less), but a lot of them also carry FS weapons which sell pretty
good.
