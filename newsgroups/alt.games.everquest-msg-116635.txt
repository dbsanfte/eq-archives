A druid can do a HUGE amount of help for a melee.  Our HP/AC buff is
at least as good as a similar level cleric.  Not to mention SLN has
that nifty regen component.  And PotG gives mana regen.  

If you can't slow a mob, a DS is probably a druids BEST damage spell.
Drop a 20 point DS on a tank and you can very quickly see upwards of
300 or 400 points of damage on a mob WITHOUT drawing any aggro on the
caster for a measly 100 mana.  And at higher levels, where the mobs
live longer, a 30point DS will add TONS to a groups total damage
output.

Our strength spell is second only to Shaman, IIRC.  

Then there's regen/chloro, which we get in group flavor, along with
wolfform (+40ATK, faster than SoW, infravison).

And there's the best Fire/Cold buffs in the game, along with a decent
ability to buff Disease and Poison.

A well played druid might not be as desirable for a melee as a cleric
and a shaman, but if you don't have either of those classes available,
a druid can more that fill BOTH their rolls, at least in an EXP group.
