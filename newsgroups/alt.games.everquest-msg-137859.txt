Rumbleroot? (i think).. heh an open first buff space for the dot is the way
to handle that

What class is your cleric?  I thought you were a dorf or something... so why
does PoG faction matter?  Every *.elf ranger/cleric in my guild didnt care
about PoG faction on our numerous pog/tunare clearings.. and thats a very
nice Ft3 earring :)

LDC? solb bugs?
Also James, (thinking back so might be out on this) its a 1hour or so re-use
time... so it really serves no purpose clearing a dot proc when soloing
