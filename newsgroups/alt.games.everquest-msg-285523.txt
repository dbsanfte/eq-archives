No, no you can't.  See, patches RARELY come thru on schedule, that 8 
hours is a mere estimate.  Sometimes the patch is complete an hour 
early, often its not complete till an hour, two, five hours later.

IF 99% of the time, the servers came up precisely on schedule, then your 
solution would work.  And, by the way, one partial solution to the 
problem would be to never ever open the servers before their estimated 
time... but thats not what happened.

I'm not beating my head against the wall, I'm just venting.  Its being 
done poorly, and you could either agree, or somehow attempt to disagree 
(I'm not sure how, but then thats what a dialog is for) or just let it 
go; after all, I stated up front that I'm not expecting a solution.

Plus, I titled my rant in a way that made it clear what it was, easy to 
skip, and you wouldn't even have to put me on ignore to do it.  Patch 
day, title like Griping re update, mark as read, moving on.

My complaining does not help fix things, because the people who could 
fix it aren't listening here.

But I didn't cut and paste a previous rant, I went thru the process 
again, and lo and behold, there's a partial improvement, which I duely 
noted.

Value added!

The Sony boards are crap, thats why I hang out here in AGE, which is 
Liberty Hall; we can spit on the floor and call the cat a bastard.

I'm not an enemy of SOE, I think EQ is the best MMOG out there, and I 
think SOE does a lot of things right.

That doesn't mean I'm going to keep my mouth shut when I see them doing 
some of those things wrong.

Thus far, you've yet to argue that they're doing their "server status" 
page right.

I, on the other hand, did note a vast improvement in the log on process; 
I'm now getting to the server select page and seeing Locked, instead of 
getting blocked on the way in, and getting messages explaining why that 
are simply incorrect.

Who's contributing less?
