Most suggestions for making money fairly quickly involve collecting
items useful for tradeskilling.

If the character is brand new (lvl<10), then he shouldn't worry too
much about getting a new weapon and aim primarily at getting xp.
Having said that his choice of hunting grounds can make a big
difference.

There are the plague rat tails (worth 1+ plat) from rats in the newbie
areas (not the rodents).

One of my favorite newbie areas is the kobolds in the newbie area of
Akanon (Steamfont) to the west of the PoK book. He should be able to
handle them starting around lvl 4 or maybe 5 depending on his class
and they will give good xp and green out around 7 or 8 (sooner?). They
fairly consistently drop hides (8 gp) and teeth (4 gp) that you can
sell to merchants, plus occasional Steamfont springwater (can get 20 -
50 plat per in bazaar and from tradeskillers, ymmv), and rarely bags.
They aren't social and don't assist each other though the kobold
shamans do heal them. The biggest danger is an orge that occasionally
wanders through the area who will attack anyone.
