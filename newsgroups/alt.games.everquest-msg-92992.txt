This weekend I noticed that I had forgotten to take off my raid gear which
had my INT at 212 and CHA at 115.  I decided to leave it alone.

I hunted in Sebilis and Chardok.  All the creatures I mezzed were blue to me
at level 56.  I don't know what level the frogs were (someone else can
answer, I was doing disco/library).  In Chardok I was camping the Bridge
Keeper/Iksar Betrayer.  BK and Ancient Guardians were yellow to me but I
didn't try to mez them.  I'll venture a guess that the average level in that
area were 50-52, but someone feel free to correct me (remember, it's higher
inside than it is at the entrance/exit...that stuff is mostly blue to my 45
wiz).

I noticed no long-term difference between CHA of 115 and 200.  Sometimes I
had spurts of failed mezzes, but this is not at all unusual for any
enchanter; CHA or not, Tash or not.

I intend to leave CHA alone until I get my INT, AC and HP up except for
cases where I might have to mez stuff very near my level or higher.
