Weapons only have a chance of increasing a pet's damage if their dmg
stat is more than 1/2 of the max damage the pet does unarmed. Delay
doesn't matter. Early on (I beleive you're past that stage), before
the pet's attacks are naturally magic, a magic weapon will allow the
pet to hit creatures that can't be hit with non-magic weapons. When
pets first become able to dual wield, they have to be given 2 weapons
to do so, but at 39 (for pure pet classes), they gain the ability to
dual wield "barehanded". Also, if the weapon given to the pet has a
proc and the pet is high enough level to use the proc, then they will
gain that benefit, Pets also gain the benifit of AC, +HP, etc off of
armor and jewelry given to them, though they're limited to the same
number of each type as a player would be. (2 earrings, 1 necklace, 2
rings, etc)
