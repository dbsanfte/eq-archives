A BST/DRU duo can handle just about anything. Druid healing is plenty for
the purpose, and a beastlord's other notable weakness is lack of root/snare,
which the druid obviously provides, not to mention tracking and porting.
Starting in the 50s the beastlord becomes a slower/haster, and a crack
provider for the duo. Meanwhile by the time the druid gets the
semi-complete-heal at 58, the beastlord pet has like 4000 HP and the
beastlord himself around the same with the druid's HP buffage (depending on
equipment). Deploying that as an effective 8000-HP tank requires some
practice and skill so the beastlord is going to be the main focus of your
attention while 2-boxing, druid is the support character.

Druid pulls with snare, beastlord slows it while warder engages, they both
toss dots on the mob, self-hasted beastlord wades in dual-wielding, BST and
warder both have druid DS on, druid cues up nuke....mob drops like a ranger
tanking the Sleeper. Druid healing/regens plus beastlord kittycrack and
racial regen ensure trivial downtime. 1 to 65 in 10 days or your money back.
