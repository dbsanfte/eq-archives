I honestly don't think it's based on how far you are through your
level.  The level con of a mob is dependent solely on your level
versus the mob (IME), there is no reason to assume a different 
mechanic for grouping.  Highest level * 2/3 rounded down is the 
simplest formula that fits all available data - Occam's razor 
suggests we accept this as the correct formula.
