Unless of course, you can't tank in RSS, MPG or RCoD, but you can tank
Creator missions, to give only one example.

There is no one true way - I love DoN, I enjoy it, and I also love OoW and
I enjoy it.  For me, they're the best two expansions I've played (I started
when Luclin was released so I don't have experience of going from Original
-> Kunark or Kunark -> Velious).

Doing the tier 1 quests was a blast, doing the tier 1 missions was
excellent and sometimes stretching.  Bashing out a creator mission every
now and then is relaxing and rewarding.  Doing a new mission every now and
then is stretching and entertaining.  Doing 30 spider missions to help my
wife's enchanter get drops for her Cultural quests was testing, but it
helped bring together a couple of core guild groups of people who now work
very well together, and it took a lot of those core players from mid 60's
to upper 60's along the way.
