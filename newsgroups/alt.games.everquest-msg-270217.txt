It seems to me it takes the game a little while to check your attempt to 
log in, and so there'd be no way to cycle thru that many attempts in the 
time you were offline.

I mean, lets assume you were gone for 12 hours (unlikely, for just 
"overnight", particularly since there was a patch which would have 
stopped this at some point).  And lets assume one attempt per second (I 
don't think thats possible either, I think it takes longer than that to 
get a "no" answer back).  12 hours*60 minutes*60 seconds= 43200 
attempts.  Thats a mere 5 digits.  The only way to get to ten digits 
would be 10^10/60/60/12=231481.148r attempts per second.  I don't care 
if the hacker has a T1 line he's not going to get that high a ping time, 
much less getting EQ to actually cycle thru its response.

Hmm, I said that wrong, the hacker wouldn't be able to start until the 
patch was over... but the point still stands, to get all the way to 12 
hours you'd have to have been gone longer than 12 hours, and the patch 
started  sometime before the 12 hour mark and then ended such that there 
was a full 12 hours left before you logged back on.
