Lots of good choices...

I 3 boxed briefly, but decided it wasn't worth the hassle or $$$... my 
trio was a sk,shm,necro... it worked too well :) I levelled so fast it 
hurt my skills badly.

I also tried a caster trio - wiz/mag/enc it worked quite well too. I 
played the enc, 2nded the mag, and pretty much ignored the wiz until it 
was time to kill it.

If you've already got a shm/war and want to add... the druid everyone 
has suggested is certainly good.

A dps melee would be quite good too...e.g. monk (FD+pulling)
