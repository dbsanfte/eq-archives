It isnt sony so much as its Windows XP's fault. XP is goofy in some
regards. I develop software for a living - and here at work,
applications that have run smoothly on NT/Win98/2000 suddenly have odd
ball issues in XP.

What gets me is that why the *%@# are they making all these changes
when their old changes are still all *%@#-ed up.

After playing COH for a bit - the bugs and annoyances are becoming
more glaring in EQ. DAMMIT SONY stop working on new shit and fix the
old stuff first. Stop the rapid fire expansions. Fix the freakin new
engine!
