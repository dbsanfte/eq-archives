The current design of the static window screen screams "You are
playing a computer game!" It really detracts from the immersion and
suspension of disbelief. I could accept a Full-Screen "Book Med". It
would be great if my character would actually open up a book and then
stuff his face in it. 

>..they should just make the screen go dark while you're medding.

I would be happy with that as  long as they lef the chat window alone.
