	I don't care about the plat.  I was running my main around the
bazaar and saw someone selling a couple of dozen haversacks for 2K each.
I figured he'd just been doing skillups and wanted to recoup his cost.
I bought two one for each of two alts.  Since then I've done a bunch of
work on my main and not a little on the alts, and I'd be very annoyed
if they did what they did last time.

	If the bag changes that's ok, I can live with that.  If they roll
me back to last week I'll be...upset.
