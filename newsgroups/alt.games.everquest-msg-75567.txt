Necromancers get spells that allow them to spend thier mana to increase
the mana pool of their target.  This is an inefficient transfer, so a
necromancer
may spend 2 mana to give one to his target... but a necromancer is much
better at generating mana quickly than a cleric is, and generally a
cleric's
use of mana is far more important to the endeavor at hand than the other
things a necro could be doing.

Advanced strategies involve other non cleric healers healing the
necromancer
who is burning his own health to generate mana quickly and dump it to
the cleric.

Another source of mana dump is the 44+ magician, who can summon
Modulating Rods.  These can be given to the cleric (or anyone else,
although need for this is relatively rare) and burned to increase mana
pool at the cost of health.  Again, this is inefficient (until a very high

level mage that is) and also requires expenditure of mana on healing
up the Mod Rod damage... but it takes mana from a mage who is
otherwise not spending on anything and gives it to a cleric who is
blowing thru it in large volumn, say while pre buffing for combat,
or mass healing up after a tough fight you've won... or resing after
a tougher one you didn't.

Its rare that any of this is called for by anyone but a cleric, who
generally has some of the largest necessary mana expenditures
and who has no way to speed his own mana generation up.  Also,
a good cleric is probably more aware of the ebb and flow of mana
and mana efficiency than any other character, and should be able
to judge when and how much of a dump, from whom, is appropriate.

I've often asked for two mod rods from the mage, one bub of mana
from the necro, all sit for 30 seconds, and start pulling again.  Instead
of the whole group sitting on their cans for five minutes because I'm
too LOM to handle the next fight, even though the other two are already
FM, we all Med up at the same time, tripling the med rate of the group.
A couple clicks on my group heal greaves and the damage caused by
the rods plus necro's damage from his health to mana converter is healed
back up while I'm healing the puller, the MA, and the chanter from
damage coming in while they all get the pull under control.
