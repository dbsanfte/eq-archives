The one point of lance's that you keep dancing around is the fact that
if the dungeon is so trivial to begin with, that a cleric can handle a
3 pull at 20m mana, how in the hell did that cleric get down to 30m to
begin with? 

If you were argueing that there's no need to stop pulling at 20m
because you can keep controled pulls coming while still giving the
cleric enough of a break to slowly build up mana again, I'd agree with
you. 

What you seem to be argueing, that it's efficient to run a cleric down
to 20m and then pull fast enough to keep him there for an hour just
means you're a bad puller. There wasn't any need to run that cleric
down to 20m to begin with. In exchange for a few extra pulls at the
beginning, you just wasted your groups ability to deal with any kind
of screwup. ... how often is that worthwhile?
