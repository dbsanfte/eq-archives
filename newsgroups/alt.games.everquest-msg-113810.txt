No, but then I don't equate a SoW request with the same thing you do,
so the question isn't relevant.

And the most likely source of that perception has been touched on
several times in this thread - namely, frequent (and often rude)
requests for SoW from people who think you owe it to them.

You're making unsupportable assumptions about the cost of the request.
See the rest of the thread for elaboration.
