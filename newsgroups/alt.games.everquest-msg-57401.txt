There is a spot in Cobalt Scar where three Bulthar stand in a rough
line along the shore. Close by them is a wandering Bulthar that walks
along the beach back and forth.

Bulthar #1 &#2 are close enough to agro each other, #3 is a little bit
farther down (and I believe out of agro of 1&2), and #4 wanders in
such a way that you can pull any one of the stationary ones safely as
long as you  watch the timing.

My question is this: Assuming the normal capabilities of a level 55
Necromancer, how should I pull this with the least risk to life and
limb? These things have not too high an MR, but they have a LOT of hit
points and they hit pretty hard. I can't fully outrun them with
JBoots, so I really want to think this through before they kill me
again...
