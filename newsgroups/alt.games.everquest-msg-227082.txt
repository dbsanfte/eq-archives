This is where NBG / No Drop becomes completely subjective.  
I was in a group where the ranger INSISTED he needed an intelligence augment. 
So we all agreed that we ALL needed it, (without discussion knowing that if the
rest of us won it we would let the chanter pick it up).  Wouldn't you know the
ranger won?
My main character is a ranger.  I was mortified.  /Ignore *Loser-ranger*.
