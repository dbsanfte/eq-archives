First off Dennis, have you looked at the actual information that has been
gathered on what the xp changes are?  I agree light blues will be basically
worthless now.  But, if I was able to get acceptable xp off light blues
prepatch, then I will likely be able to get acceptable xp off of lower dark
blues post patch.  I spent a couple of hours in a group in Skyfire last
night, killing mostly the lower level dark blue mobs, and xp was moving
fine.  It was not great, but it was moving.

As I said before, I expect I'll be able to find a few spots where I can hunt
for xp.
