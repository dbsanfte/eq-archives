/em wonders why this news brought out the last two emotions, other than that
his first major character (above LV6) was an Ogre Warrior.
/em remembers the fun of being an Ogre, and if not for the KOS problem,
might continue in EQ, or may just wait and have the "KOS = Bashing practice"
mentality for his EQ2 Ogre

I hope they enable sound for many of the emotes (with the option to turn
them off).  A belching ogre would be more run to play than just an ogre who
sticks his face out at you.  I do wish they made the Ogres fatter and faces
more like the original EQ.  That is one class I might turn new models back
off for just to see a somewhat better/less messed up look.

Scarry?  Like seeing a spiderling spawn in mid air, hoover there for a LONG
time.  Decide to stand under it looking directly up.  While taking a
screenshot, then standing and admiring it's rarely seen underside for a few
minutes, the thing starts wiggling its leggs and falls on your face (by the
way...19" monitor in dark room for added effects. =) ).

I'm not sorry for that. I'm sorry for accedently buying my LV12 summon
corpse spell, thinking it was my PET spell, and then realizing I paid 22pp
for a spell I can sell back for 2pp and will likely NEVER use (it only works
until LV35 anyway).

How about some NEW and ADDITIONAL particle effects?  Too many look almost
EXACTLY the same.  We need more spell effects.  How hard is that to
impliment?

Of corse though only if/when server population requires it (they
won't/better not merge/cut servers without a large enough population drop).

Won't have TIME for another expansion.  Planes of Power will be out...but
see the pattern.

1999, March - EQ
2000, March - RoK
2000, December - SoV
2001, December - SOL expansion (oops...meant SoL expansion)
2002, late in the year - PoP expansion (Hey Varent, notice the ONE "o",
don't repeat SOL/SoL with the server issues again).
2003, late in the year - EQ2
