    Hmm - I wonder if that's why I didn't see Dark Deathsinger in the
Innothule last night? 8) I had to settle for killing one of the
swamp-dwelling paladins, instead.

    What this actually seems to mean is the "soft cap" on INT/WIS has been
raised to 255. You now SEEM to get the normal amount of mana for a point of
INT/WIS all the way to 255, as opposed to before where it capped at 200.

    Stops all that obnoxious Mark of Karn spam.

    "Our experiment in making ports difficult has failed. We now realize,
with SoL, that the real key is to just not HAVE ports!" Sigh. One more
backpack slot for me, anyways.

    Hmm. So if my cleric stands beside one and fires off her point blank
AoE, it won't damage the NPC? If that NPC then swings at me and hits me,
will I auto-target them, allowing everyone else to /assist off me? Can I
nail them with other AoE effects? This sounds like it's for the new NPC
merchants, and it would stop a lot of possible griefing, but I hope they
have a few true assholes on staff to totally de-grief things....

    There's already one such item in game from before SoL's release - the
Iksar SK "epic" weapon, Greenmist, has a bonus to damage against Shissar.
Supposedly some of the bonusses are things like "plus 10% to Tinkering".
Should be neat to find a few!

    Now if only the one SoL ability I was interested in getting hadn't come
so massively pre-nerfed....
