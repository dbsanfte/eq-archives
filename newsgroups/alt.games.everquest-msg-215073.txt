Okay, this is what's happening *as I understand it*.
I'm not the people involved so I don't know if they
actually *have* done what they have said they have
done.

We have a couple of people in our guild who can't
use the Wayfarer Camp Maguses/Magi. They say they
have their stone. They say they went to their home
city and went through the whole business with that
NPC and we even had them go through the give and
take with the NPC at the camp we were at last night.
Still, the Maguses/Magi won't port them.

Any thoughts as to what's going on? Has anyone else
heard of people who have supposedly done the correct
stuff and still can't use the ports? We know that
they've done *something* because they're able to go
into the dungeons with us, right? Or does the fact
that you have LDoN enabled mean that you can go into
dungeons without doing anything else?
