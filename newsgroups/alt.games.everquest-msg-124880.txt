In alt.games.everquest, thou, Boddhisatva (angrycornflake@NOSPAM.comcast.net), hast wrytted...
>My Iksar Monk has reached level 30 and I'm wondering where to hunt now.

When Velious came out, my monk was around level 30.  At the time, duoing
with a shaman, the snow cougars in IC were *great* exp, plus you'd get a
Cougar Claw earring every once in awhile (they were worth a lot more
then).  You can also solo the cougars with some pain (although maybe not
yet at 30).
