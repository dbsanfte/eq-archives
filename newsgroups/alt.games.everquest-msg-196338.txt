Hmm ok I'll qualify this, the lowest healing effect item I ever had
was II and I never saw any message like this.  From memory the
message I got was something along the lines of "your Book of Obulus
begins to glow" and I'd get something along the lines of a 20%

about 30 Turtleshell Helms before focus effects were added.
