Well, I find it amusing that people get frustrated about how worse their 
class is compared to another, without doing the simple check to see if 
it's true.

I don't mind people feeling hard done by, but it's frustrating for 
someone to claim they're hard done by when they're working on a small 
sample set or just pure observation and not doing the background checks.

Everyone plays the game at their own level, and for many it's just a 
game while they're playing it and when they're not, it doesn't exist. 
For others the opposite extreme is true.  It's true of any game, hobby 
or sport.

The issues I see with it though are caused when cultures clash.  In the 
same way that someone who plays hockey and who doesn't train or work out 
outside of the games joins a team who take it a little more seriously, 
is going to cause frustration.  In the hockey example this is mitigated 
because there isn't really a concept of 'pick up hockey', however in EQ 
where pick up groups are a reality, it's exactly this difference in play 
style that causes the problems people have with pick up groups.

If someone in a group I'm in demonstrates less knowledge about the class 
they're playing than I have, even though I'm not playing their class, 
then it's annoying.  Sometimes this is pretty basic, for example, not 
knowing the full effects of their own spells or not knowing the 
implications of using certain tools.

A classic example is mages who don't know how aggro works and who use 
earth pets in XP groups.

Everyone has the right to play the game to the depth they feel they wish 
to, as long as everyone remembers that it's exactly that freedom which 
causes friction in pick up groups :)
