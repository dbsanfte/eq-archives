I'm going to be honest with you.  It sucks, but it's reality.

Unless you're an enchanter or VERY good friends with one, jewelcraft is a
trade skill you want to avoid.  You already know why...it's expensive and
it's a pain getting the bars enchanted.

Jewelcraft is very expensive to learn.  High charisma (115) and faction
(better than indifferent usually) are required to lessen the costs.  Even
then it's extremely expensive.  Enchanters can easily do something about CHA
and faction...you cannot.
