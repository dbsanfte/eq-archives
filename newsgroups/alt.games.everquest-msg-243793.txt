Yes, I ran into this while going up to turn in Tormax's head.
Assuming you have the same eq-toolbox map that I do, following the red 
lines, at the point where a teleporter takes you to a spot not marked 
with a red line, you have to take just a step or two (backwards I think,
not sure though) to hit another teleporter and get back onto the 
marked path. Basically one very short red line segment is missing 
or maybe is too short for the map to display.
