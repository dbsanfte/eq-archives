Then your friend is going to lose all the time and effort
he put forth to help.

Many parts of many epics involve giving things to folks
to combine and get back, or triggering a NPC with
some chit-chat.

For epic quests (not just the rogue one), the actual quest
folks 1) won't talk to you until 50, and 2) will just say "thanks"
when you hand 'em your hard won quest pieces.

Why? Take the Ragebringer quest for instance.  It CAN
be MQ'd, simply because the last step involves handing
in 2 NO DROP pieces and 1 droppable knife.  It would
be possible for a level 60 rogue to redo his epic up to the
point of getting another General's pouch, during which time
he'd also get a Jagged Diamond Dagger from Renux.  The
level 60 could also have a Cazic Quill from the General or the
side quest.  He could then hand that JDD to a level 1 rogue,
turn in the GP/CQ, and have the level 1 rogue turn in the
JDD.

This would be a level 1 character with an epic.  VI KNEW
that folks would try it, and didn't want it.  Stanos would
eat all the pieces from a level 1, and he would do the same
for a level 49.

Hell, you can pickpocket the notes from the guildmasters
at 32 (one rogue I know...died twice, but skill was sufficient).
Hand the top and bottom pieces to Stanos to combine at
that time, though, and he'll just thank you.  Do the same at
50 and you've started your quest.
