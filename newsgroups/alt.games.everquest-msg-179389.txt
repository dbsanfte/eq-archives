Does anyone know when this was changed? You used to be able to bandage over
50% IF you completed the bandage before health got to the 50% mark. I used
to be able to fully heal newbie characters with one bind wounds but now it
does half, as I also used to be able to bind slightly over the 50% mark in
health if I timed it right.
