The level 44 spell is definately trivial at 167, I'm not sure of the trivial
level for IC but I would think it's around there. I seem to remember reading
that the L16 spells trivial at skill 20 though, so it might be as high as
185 (if spell trivial raises by 5*level).

Note you can only raise your skill to 165 by training, I presume you can get
further by doing the Concordance quest although I haven't tried. Personally,
I'd just go for it, getting more runes via the Staff quest should be fairly
trivial at L49 anyway :).
