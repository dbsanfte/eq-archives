Narandi is indeed kitable, we had a 60 druid running him near the wurm caves
for a good 3 minutes till we were set up for him. And a force of 50-60 people,
levels ranging from mid 40s (there for faction only) to 60s doing the majority
of the damage. It was my first major raid type function and I have to say I had
a blast! Two deaths and rezzes later I had a much better faction with Thurg and
am on my way to having good faction with CoV.  Hope to join in and do this
again soon. =)
