The interdependency is only a problem when it becomes prohibitive, i.e.,
when you cannot get done what you need to do, when you want to do it, and at
a price that leaves a reasonable margin of profit for yourself.

Rather than throwing away a brilliant idea, I think they should have done an
effort to make it easier for buyers and sellers to interact without having
to be online and do nothing else. I constantly find myself in situations
where nobody's currently offering the interims I need, but I'm sure that
there must be dozens of crafters who would like to make a buck selling from
their stock to me; they're just not selling at the moment. And when I
advertise for the service of a woodworker, I usually only get one reply, if
any at all, so it's seller's market in the extreme.

You should able to place both orders and goods on the market and let bidders
fight it out while you go hunting mobs or turn off your computer to get some
sleep. Market economy only works if there is a functionï¿½ng market in the
first place.
