Ok, WTF happened to the dwarf camp in BB?  I've been hunting them for about
a week or two on and off.  Last night I'm on my way to meet a friend and
decide to kill em real quick on the way.

Pull up, snare Linn, run past the hutt "Guards Guards!!"...run up to the
hill and turn to snare the other two, BUT ... They're right on top of me.

Hmmm...that's weird, never happened before, oh well...I'll just run a bit,
and turn and snare em...NOPE, on top of me again...WHACK WHACK, full HP is
now 2/3 gone in two hits.  Hmmmm...run run run...

What, did these Dwarves have JBoots or something?  They were keeping up with
level 44 Form of the Great Wolf.  Thought I was gonna have to tuck tail and
run, but finally got the kite under control and whacked em all...

End result (after 2 greater heals), three dead Dwarves and me at 10m and
about 15hp (from 1152).  WTF was up with the Dwarf camp?

Just weirded me out, wondered if anyone else had that happen.
