    Then what's to stop everyone's alt from making a tradesman?  Moorgard has
already said that at start up, there will be no single character servers.  I
don't think they are trying to make tradesmen less common at all, quite the
opposite.

   For what it's worth, the way Moorgard has said tradeskill in EQII will be
handled is thus:  The act of making something will in itself be like a mini
game.  He used the example of smithing, and rather rely on my own faulty memory
to paraphrase it I googled and cut and pasted it.  Behold the power of ctrl-c,
ctrl-v!

(/Moorgard)

Let's look at crafting a breastplate. (Again, this is a hypothetical example, so
keep in mind the specifics of the process may vary.) Instead of obtaining
components, plopping them into a forge, and hitting a combine key, we add flavor
to the process. You take your components (which will vary, again depending on
the level of the item you're trying to create) and fire up the forge. At this
point you enter into a kind of mini game. You need the forge to stay in a
certain temperature range during this process, so you have to control the amount
of wood you put on the fire. While keeping an eye on that, you also take actions
that affect the properties of the finished product. You can refine the armor,
which makes it lighter. This impacts its durability, however, so you might want
to bolster durability by reinforcing the armor. You'll also want to shape the
breastplate, which affects its overall quality. The Artisan must decide at which
point in the process the armor is done, because keeping it in the forge too long
could weaken it. 

(/Moorgard)

   What he did not say is how the smith is to obtain the components.  He has
said that some of the higher end items will involve getting drops off of mobs,
but no saying how far, if at all, one will be able to go with merchant bought
stuff.

   I think everyone, pretty much, will have an tradesman alt.  But I think that
this mini-game won't appeal to all.  It might be interesting the first time or
two, but in order to be good, one is going to have to play it alot.  It sounds
like it is going to take longer to craft anything.  And I think that is going to
be the separation point between serious tradesmen and the rest.  Would one
rather spend their online time playing the mini-game, or the meta one?  

Right now, of course, there is no saying which of them might be the more
interesting.
