well hehe, I don't think I'm going over the deep end, just don't like
the path they appear to me to be taking.  I'll just find another game to
play is all.

and just for the record, I don't have a problem with EQ2, I may play it
even, my problem is with EQ3, EQ4 and on and on.  Get what I'm sayin?  I
would jump into EQ2 with both feet(assuming it is fun to play) if I knew
they weren't going to do the same thing again.  Some folks may have no
problem with that method of upgrading and thats ok, I'm just saying for
me, thats not the game I want to play, I'll simply do something else
with my online gaming time and dollars.
