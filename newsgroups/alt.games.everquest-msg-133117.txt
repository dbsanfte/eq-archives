One gripe of mine for ages has been that Heroic Bonds
doesn't overwrite Heroism (and vice versa)

This means that when (say) I rez someone, I have
to either cast HB to get them on the same page
as everyone else, or make sure to have them
click Heroism off before next HB refresh, or
cast the oddly sucky Fortitude instead.  I quite
often resorted to the last approach, HB costs
more mana and people just don't click off on
command very well in the heat of battle.

Well, yesterday I cast Heroism on myself when
my Aego faded (boy, Aego sucks when it fades,
I'm used to seeing -either- HB -or- Symbol fade,
not essentially both at  the same time, why I had
the HP of a buffed up enchanter all of a sudden!)
running across ME to rez a friend in UP.  When
I got her body recovered and rezed, I cast HB
as a matter of habit.  A little mana wasteful, but that
way we both have HB if someone else joins us, so
there won't be any refresh issues, and we have to
wait for her to med up anyway.

BIG NEWS: Heroic Bonds overwrote Heroism.
Its like getting a new spell, frankly, I hardly ever
cast Heroism cause of the pesky overwrite issues.
Of course its also like losing a spell, Fortitude now
is even more useless than ever...but I didn't cast
Fortitude all that often I usually cast HB in a wasteful
manner instead, unless mana was really really tight.

My friend got some mana up and tried out her new
POTC on us.  Overwrote HB, and would -not-
overwrite my BAOR.  More good news.  I should
have cast HB to be sure it won't wipe POTC off her,
that would be the ideal result.  I didn't experiment with
this before but I'm pretty sure POTG used to overwrite
my BAOR and HB both, which was very annoying...
is that correct?  Is this an unannounced anti-nerf?  Having
not tried this carefully in the past, I would have thought
I was just wrong about the way it worked... except that
I'm certain of the HB/Heroism issue change.

BAOR overwrites Khundra's Focussing now.  Did it
always?  Does the reverse also happen?

Please experiment with any other annoying overwrite issues
you may have had in the past and report back, did they
change anything else for the better?
