i have no idea, honestly, that's what this thread was about ... i
heard of projectEQ

 i was asking if i was the only person to wonder about doing this

ditto





if you're saying that info has to be stolen, that's a whole other
thing

for our discussion though...

if it was compiled by someone playing the game (and taking notes on
all the quests or estimating how the server has to behave, etc) then
that's about equivalent to the "new-use" idea that i've been talking
about - that information is probably subject to the same protections,
and likewise, it doesn't seem like it would be copyright infringement
to use that product that was paid for in a different way

if it was all custom, that might actually be worse because it could
seem more like a "derivative" product ... though i'm not sure, and i
do think you need a lawyer to figure that out

i was thinking about that before
