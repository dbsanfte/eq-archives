 Why are the flowing thought items in the game so much harder to find than
haste items? Has anyone asked verant about this? It just doesn't seem to
make sense to me.
 Anyone know of a good flowing thought item that doesn't require killing the
head mob in the planes or a quest that takes every trade skill to do?
 Thanks
