Why isnt it cleric duties?

I'll use an example... Ssra.  Fighting to HP, XTC, or AL.. 90% of your
clerics will do NOTHING, maybe nuke and buff.. no heals required.. even if
like my guild you don't pull mobs to you and assist an MA (F8 assist... just
run upto the yard trash)..  you can nuke too.. no constant healing (e.g
rotation) to worry about..

Maybe 2 clerics will be healing tanks, the rest (id figure 6+ for any named)
just twiddle their thumbs..

Why can't they cure?  The traps will drain mana, and in many cases kill your
guildies very fast.. so until you have more important duties, why isnt grc
and rc "cleric duties"?

In battle is 1 thing... but thats one mob, and I can't think of many mobs
needing cures that the mob takes longer than the getting to him......
