    Great news My Iksar (Is there any better race? P)Necro made 12 last
night, an attained indifferent faction with the Necro trainer in EFP /cheer.
Now to move on to gathering belts to gain more faction.

    Anyway, what is the best spell line up for soloing in EC /  WC.  Most of
the Orc's are conning blue now.  Just like some advice from the fellow
Necro's of the boards here.

    One last question what is the best thing to hunt to gain faction in FP
to use the bank?  I understand there are three factions in FP just don't
want to hunt something that will gain faction with one and loose faction
with another.

    Thanks for any advice anyone can give.

Frederick J.
Haarm Iksar Necro of 12 seasons. <Brell>
