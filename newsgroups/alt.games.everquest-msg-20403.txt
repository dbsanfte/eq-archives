Heh. I had some guy in Iceclad who was standing around while I was
hunting cougars with a group asking for SOW over and over again...in
the middle of fights, right after fights, etc. I didn't answer for a
while, hoping he would get the hint. Finally:

Me: Oh, yeah, sure, I'll use all my mana to buff you all I can while
I'm at it. My group doesn't need me to use it to help them...
Him: I meant when you're done...
[ANother pull comes in. In the middle of the fight]
Him: SOW me?

GRAH! /ignore lamer.
