I doubt that...  quote right off their page

"After the disappointment of getting my Soul Essence of Aten Ha Ra eaten by
the Remains of Vah Kerrath, I managed to get a hold of our Server GM,
Saiphos.  Say what you will about Verant CS but our man on Veeshan is a
hardcore bad ass. He checked out the quest, he checked out the logs and with
a little work, managed to get it to work.

All was not lost...

BEHOLD!

NOW - the next step is to find the guy that made this item, sit him down in
a room, put all VT loot in front of him, lock the door to the room with him
inside, and come back in 24 hours.

When you open the door, you will more than likely find that 1) Your
itemization woes are over and 2) He has a working cure for cancer.

This is what the end game should look like. "
