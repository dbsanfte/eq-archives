    If you where a Dark Elf Necromancer and you where at Level 26 What
Robe would you own if you had the choice between a

1.A Flowing Black Robe

2.A Blackened Crystalline Robe.

The reason I am posting this is because last night I sold my Flowing
Black Robe for a Blackened Crystalline Robe.  I need the Flowing Black
robe. Down the road for my Epic. but they seem to be dropping
dramatically in Price the flowing Black robe's that is at least on the
Kane Bayle Server.  So down the road I will pick up another Flowing
Black robe.  But for now the Blackened Crystalline robe seem's to have
better Stat's

A Flowing Black Robe on Kane Bayle Generally sell's for about 200pp

When the Blackened Crystalline robe sell's for 350-500pp
