[reordered comments so this reads more easily]

I just wanted to point out that the Everquest patcher didn't add the 
WININET.DLL to my system. I did. (The patcher wouldn't run without it.) 
After reading your reply, I re-read my post and realized it looks like I 
implied that it did so. I just wanted to make this clear. 

Sorry for any confusion.
