I can only talk of the 2 that I have played.

DAOC - fun for the first 35 levels or so, then it just becomes too slow to
get anything done and they death penalty is so much worse that EQ in xp
terms. But up till here with the battle grounds etc. it is fun. Though
content is lacking you basically kill the same mobs with different names
over and over and over.

AO - I like most of the things about this, except there are no real co-opt
dungeons. I love the missions etc, but sometimes it is fun to go to a
dungeon with lots of other people there killing things and having fun. Note,
this is supposedly been added, but I have not played in a while. I may
actually grab this again and check it out.

There are reviews out there on all the games you mentioned.
