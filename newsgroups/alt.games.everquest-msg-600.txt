Here's a good example of that said group, which we use quite effectively at
the Giant fort in BW.  1 Paladin, 1 SK (me) 1 Shaman, 1 Monk.  We're all
close friends which makes it even more fun.  Me and the monk melee, while I
throw in some DoT's and life taps, The Paladin chain casts his helmet to
keep the monk at near full HP while the Shaman keeps us buffed and slows the
mob.  Quite effective, and 0 downtime.
