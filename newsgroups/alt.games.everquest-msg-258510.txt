Ornate I'm working on as hard as I can.    Not really needing a bow too
much, since I should be doing the VP quest soon.  More hitpoints than a
stonewood, although without the regen / atk.  130'ish instead of 100.

There is, unfortunately its slot 3.  Which means 1500 adventure poitns for
the haste augment, then another 1500 for a piece of armor that it can fit
in.    After I finish saving up 1000 points for an Anger III augment to put
in my sword.

At the rate I'm getting points, thats a loooong way off ; )
