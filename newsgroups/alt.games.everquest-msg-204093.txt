    It's also useful indoors. It's well worth getting, especially when you
compare it to the alternatives available.

    This is one of the first PoP AA's taken by paladins and shadow knights,
and is high on the list for warriors as well. It apparently gives a solid
DPS boost. If you plan to use two handers for a good deal of your career,
it's well worth it.

    Yes, they leave a corpse. On a recent 8th shawl run, I saw a ranger with
Headshot have it go off twice. So it seems to have a fairly low chance of
firing, just like Assassinate for rogues.

    You'd have a very, very slim chance of it going off on any particular
mob. Just activate Trueshot and drop the bird in seconds if you fear being
KS'ed.

    They're the best AA's a ranger can spend. I'd think long and hard before
deciding to pass them up.
