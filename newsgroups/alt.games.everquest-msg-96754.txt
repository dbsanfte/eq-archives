You might try going to the auction zone on your server and asking to buy
a silvery war axe. Not bad for low levels, and definitley in your price
range. (Have to double check... I *think* rangers can use, but not
positive.) There's also some Kunark drops off giants that people sell
very cheaply, though they tend to be heavy as hell. Keep your eyes open
for a good deal and ask for the stats (and who can use) on any cheap
weapons that you see for sale in auction.
