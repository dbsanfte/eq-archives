Thanks for the info so far, I really appreciate it.
   Ryou, I have saved your guild, and will be putting it up after I had
the HTML to it.  
   Also thanks to Darkensolo and Georg for the links.  I will be looking
to these for inspiration.  Especially thanks for the EQnecro one; I was
pretty much trying to recreate the format at least from memory.  I will
be using this alot.  I may try to cull some of the guides from there as
well, but not sure, since they are all (reasonably) from the necro point
of view.  I want my hunting guild section to be useful to all classes,
not just necros.  Plus, the thing hasn't been updated for quite a
while.  The guild on hunting the Nybrights, for example, makes no
mention of the corrupted, murderous horse that makes the camp much less
attractive than it used to be, imo.  And of course it doesn't have any
of the Luclin grounds.  But... it does give me a very decent place to
start!
