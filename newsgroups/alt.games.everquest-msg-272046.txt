I gotta agree. I'm glad SoE is sticking to their original design and
philosophy. I would feel that way about any game, regardless of which
route it took, soloable, groupable or both. I think it's a bad idea to
design the core of a game with one philosophy in mind and then try to
bend it to satisfy another. It is what it is. Play it if it's your bag,
don't if it's not. 

Additionally, it's no secret that people will tend to beg for things
that aren't necessarily good for them or the game in the long run.
Instant gratification rules the day far too often.
