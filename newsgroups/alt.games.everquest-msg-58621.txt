    Oh man, I would have a hell of a time if 
they ever added that many slots.  I have too
many characters as it is, and have to fight
the urge to fill up the last two slots.  
   Lately, I've been thinking that it might
be neat to have a gnome necromancer.  But
I know that would take playing time away from
my DE mage.  Who is taking time away from my
Gnome wizard.  Who is taking time away...well,
you get the point.  Well, I'm not really playing
my cleric or enchanter, but I can't bring myself
to delete two members of such sought-after 
classes.  But I insist on keeping two slots
open.  One so that I can start a kitty, should
I decide to, and one to create a "temp" should
I need to have a character in a zone quickly
without having an established on hand.
  So...um, we were talking about having 82 slots?
Yeah, that would be good.

            in no time flat.
