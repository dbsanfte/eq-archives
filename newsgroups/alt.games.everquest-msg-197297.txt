Can you explain how, and what your thinking is on that lineup?

DD seems pretty silly to me as a general rule, mana inefficient, root breaking
spell line.  Wouldn't you rather have another Poison DOT or Disease DOT?  They
do all stack you know.  Sure, these break root too but at least they are more
efficient.

Debuff.  Which one?  Why?  Do you find that it really reduces melee damage
output?  Or do you mean a resist  debuff?  Since I don't see Slow in your
lineup, do you not melee?  If you don't, whats the Haste doing in there.

Regen/Quickness but not /SOW?  You fight unsnared mobs with no SOW on?
Dungeons maybe?  I can't think why, outdoors, you wouldn't want to run SOW
24/7.

I'm looking at moving to a single "buff" slot, as much of a pain as it is to
keep swapping them around for such short duration spells.  Will clear up two
spell slots though, giving me canni and either a third DOT or my new toy,
Befriend Animal.  You should see my little hasted greyhopper buddy chew thru
the level 28/29 slowed mobs in Marus Seru!  What I need are more zones with my
level mobs and level 24 animals.
