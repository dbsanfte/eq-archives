In the case of Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa: lots of AIDS in the
population. IMO, they're just being too lazy/'political correct' to
sort out countries after actual risk factors. There are millions of
scandinavians with higher risk factors than me, but not even my
father, who married a very religious and 'pure living' woman, can
donate blood since that woman happened to be from the wrong country.
If I marry a Norwegian guy, he wouldn't be allowed to donate either
since I wasn't born here, and neither would our children.
