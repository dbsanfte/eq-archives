You'll find a lot of the stuff in EW is still DB and easy meat at that 
level. I'd suggest the wyverns in cobalt scar, but you might be just a 
tad too young for them yet, plus I've heard rumor that Sony nerfed the 
hell out of the faction and aggro radius there so the named are going 
medieval on anybody quadding the wyversn these days.
