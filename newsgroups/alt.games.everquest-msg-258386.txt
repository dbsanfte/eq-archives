Maybe lousy is too harsh of a word. How about gear not as good as
others? I'm part of a raiding guild and my Cleric has been built to
not only have a large mana pool to heal but enough HPs to tank for a
period of time if necessary. Most good gear these days have a
combination of high AC, high HPs and high Mana and yep there is a
tanking difference between a cleric who is EP/Time/GoD geared then a
cleric who isn't. On hard stuff, prolly not since their Attack ratings
are prolly through the roof, but on a normal 65 LDoN my cleric can
tank easily as well as any other tank.
