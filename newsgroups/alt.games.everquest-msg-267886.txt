Haven't found a fishing place but i found you can improve other harvesting
goods by going to the zones like "the sprawl". I have looked about and can
only guess the fishing might be in the sunken city, or part of the smaller
zones that i haven't been to yet. Mostly i've thrown away the results; i
have little inventory space and everything's no value. I have bought a
market sign and was just wondering if there's any point selling the stuff to
other players (i did this a lot in swg) or if you have to use it to practice
artisanship?
