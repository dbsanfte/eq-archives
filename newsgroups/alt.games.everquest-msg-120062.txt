I just had an idea on that... Now, if you're very very thirsty, mana 
doesn't regen, right?

So... get very thirsty, get clarity, med up to absolutely full mana and 
click off clarity. (oh yeah, make sure you'e not wearing any FT gear. :) )

now you can cast spells and add up the mana costs until you're oom without 
having to worry about how much mana regenned while you were casting.
