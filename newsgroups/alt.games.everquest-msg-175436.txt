	It is not a question of being carried.  It is a question of being able to
try at all.  Again, if all of your (e.g.) plate tanks have moved on, there's
not much a dozen Rangers and Druids and such can do to get themselves flagged.
Rangers are much more viable as tanks than we used to be -- I can tank
lower-end stuff in Storms, though you really don't want me to -- but there is
no way I could tank for a trial group.  Likewise, you *need* a Cleric, and you
*need* a slower (a real one, not a Ranger swinging Earthcaller and praying).

	I won't say that it is impossible to get through the trials without core
classes, but I will say that I don't think it can be done with less than level
63 characters with significant AA in Luclin endgame gear.  And it's not that
ancillary classes don't hold up their end in trial group.  It's just that you
don't *need* any of them for one.  Holy Trinity groups can get through just
fine on their own, and if all such players in a given guild do that, the rest
can be left behind.
