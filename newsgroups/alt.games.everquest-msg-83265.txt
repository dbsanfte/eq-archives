I was hanging around Shady when I saw this item on him and bought it for about
1pp and 4gp. Its a 2hs dmg 25 dly 48 ac 5 wt 8.0 weapon, so I might be able to
sell it to a Pally or SK.

Problem is, I've never seen one for sale before. I assume they're a Luclin
drop, since the weapon isn't listed at Everlore. How much do they usually sell
for?
