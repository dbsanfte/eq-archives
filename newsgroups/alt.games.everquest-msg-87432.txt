  I find this a little hard to swallow.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but
Verant has no compelling reason to hurt their reputation by banning people for
such a reason.  They can simply remove the offending messages.  I guess it could
be a problem if a person keeps reposting what they had removed, but if a person
is persistently flooding the message boards with the same complaints over and
over again, that's not exactly making a 'civil' argument and frankly is clearly
a violation of the terms of service that users of Verant's message boards agree
to.

  But maybe it does happen.  I was once temporarily suspended from chat just for
suggesting that the situation with 1018 errors and Verant's policy and
implemented procedures were inadequate... he didn't give me any warning
personally, though he did once execute a macro that said something about "not
using chat solely to vent"... which I personally don't do.  I will criticize
Verant on some subjects when they come up, but just as often I'm helping people,
defending Verant or their policy, or just casually chatting.  I attribute that
incident to one trigger happy GM's lack of patience than an overzealous Verant
policy in general... and it was afterall just a temporary chat suspension and
not a complete account ban.
