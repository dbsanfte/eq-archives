Directly ask them to do what they should. examples:
"Please snare all mobs so we dont have to chase"
"Please summon some arrows for our puller"
"Please clarity other casters when you clarity yourself so they dont have to
keep asking"

Second try:
"This chasing mobs business is getting old. Please snare" etc etc.

If they still wont do it, tell em your sick of asking them and your gonna
find another group. Put them on /ignore so you wont make the mistake of
grouping with them again.
