I don't know...I think he has at least some points.

I mean, look over at that other thread that's going on right now (and
on, and on); it seems to be about "42" insisting that CoH should adopt
the mob experience apportionment of Everquest instead of the
split-XP-by-damage system currently in place because it will cut down
on "kill-stealing"...when in fact CoH as it is now doesn't *have* the
form of kill-stealing that Everquest featured (due to Everquest's "he
who does the majority of the damage gets everything" apportionment
system).  

All it would take for the theory to apply completely would be for 42
to have left EQ in the first place in part because of
kill-stealing...
