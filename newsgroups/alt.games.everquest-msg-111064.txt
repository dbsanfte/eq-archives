They have certain abilities depending on rank - Seniors and up have a
command that they can become various race/gender/monster.

But all the spell-type effects are inventory items. One thing you'll
note is you'll never see a Beastlord GM/guide. Why? The pet spell is a
skill and the GM/guides can't have pets due to aggro issues.

More like they're nodrop and available only from either the
GM/guide-only zone (CSHome) or directly from a full GM, so a regular
PC could never get one in the first place.
