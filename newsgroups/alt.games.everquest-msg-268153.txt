I agree.  And, even more to the point *right now* IMO,
no one really knows how the middle game will go either.
EQ clerics didn't get CHeal until 39 -- and groups at
that point went from "well, a druid or shaman will do
because they have damage shields or slows" to "only
a cleric here" (a mistake in a lot of places, but still...)

There very well may be that type of "gotcha" in EQ2.
Until enough groups get out there and start actually
encountering the day to day grinds, we won't know.
And, like Kunark and Velious, we really won't know
how the game will develop in expansions either -- and
they could really change things in a hurry...

I will say that -- again, IMO from the low-levels -- the
developers *seem* to have caught a lot of the *known*
"gotchas" -- all priests can rez, healing seems to be a
non-issue with any priest, there aren't any "solo god"
classes, etc.   But we won't know how well that *really*
works out until there are a lot of 40+ groups out there
*and* we've seen an expansion or two and can see
how the game progresses.
