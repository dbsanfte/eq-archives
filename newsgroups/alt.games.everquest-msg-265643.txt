The problem is not that CAN-SPAM is dormant it's that it's not
effective.  Even were it aggressively enforced it wouldn't do more than
slightly dent the spam problem.

Having read the law I see several mistakes/loopholes.

1. No requirement that the bulk emailer only send to Verified Opt-In
addresses - just a requirement of an opt-out link.
2. Minimum levels before which a spammer can be nailed.
The spammers have already used fake names for accounts, so what's
stopping spammer X from sending out limit-1 spams from 500 names instead
of 500x limit from one name?
3. It doesn't address the source of the problem at all and in fact makes
it clear that congress view email commerce as a good thing.

The SOURCE of the spam is NOT the ISP it's sent from - that's the
BROADCAST SOURCE.
The SOURCE of the spam is NOT the Spammer who sends the spam to the ISP
- he's the FEED SOURCE.

The SOURCE of the spam is the businesses hiring the spammer to advertise
for them.  CAN-SPAM doesn't address them at all and provides no
penalties for them.

Making it illegal to profit from spam nails the spammer, AND the people
who hired the spammer to advertise for them.

Going after the actual spammers is like arresting street level drug
dealers - as long as the source is around and there's money to be made
there'll be another guy in his spot before it's cooled.

If hiring a spammer gets your business audited and results in major
fines, you won't do it because it's no longer "cheap" advertising.
