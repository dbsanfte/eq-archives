Dire Charm is a level 59+ ability.  Ok, they can solo swell then, but
for the other 99% of the game, they are pretty gimpy soloers.  Well
below druids

>2)necro (next best soloer also using dire charm and fear kiting)

Yes, Necro's are the best soloer in the game, but they seem to have
the same problem as druids.  They just are no needed in the end game.

>3)shaman (best conventional soloer)

Shaman's lack of a snare spell puts them behind druids in solo
ability.

>4)wizards ( did i mention 4 can one shot kunark dragons? )

Wizards don't come into they're power till well after they get they're
snare spell.  And they are more difficult to play at early levels
where druids are pretty cake to play from 1 to 60.

>5)magicians (epic pet required or you sink lower)

Mages are MUCH better soloers than Wizards for about the first 40
levels, IIRC.

>one every 30 seconds)

Monk are, I'm told, excellent soloers.  I can believe it.  They do
truckloads of damage, have some decent ability to heal themselves, and
a nice out if they get into trouble.

>hope with every shot)

Once again, Endless Quiver is a level 59+ ability.  Granted, rangers
are good soloers before this, but in limited situations IE, animal
based mobs.

>8) sks are about here.

Shadowknights are better soloers than Rangers because they can fear
kite ANY mob, and they get the bonus of being an actual tank class.

>9) ooo ooo druids ! well maybe bards should be above not sure.

No, druids are second to Necro's.  They can root&rot like necro's,
charm kill like enchanters (in the right situation), and quad kite
like a wizard.  

The are definitely number 2 on the list of soloers.  A solid two.

>10-11) closely followed by paladins and beastmasters.

Don't know much about the beastmasters, but from my understanding they
solo as well as a mage at least.
