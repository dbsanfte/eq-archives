I did not screw up my first post, nor do I need to regain face in a
group that is overloaded with a bunch of gaming freaks that think they
are better than everyone else just because they know so damn much
about a freaking online game.

>Yes, some people actually think this way. That blurb the other girl is
>repeating ad nauseum labels you pretty well.

Well considering that you didn't hear the entire conversation nor know
me or the other person and our relationship, yeah, I suppose you could
not understand it. And if you can't figure it out, I was telling him
that I wasn't going to just take your (collective) shit and just sit
back. I did say that I was playing nice. I could be a shitload nastier
but as I stated earlier, I have friends here and don't care to fuck it
up for them.

I asked an innocent question. It's not my fault you all tend to leap
to the extreme. Though at this point I now understand why you all do.
Doesn't make it ok, just means that I understand where you all are
coming from.

>People who post "Why don't you play DAoC?" are asking an innocent
>question too. See how well received that kind of post is.

Well as I don't play that game, I can't determine if there is anything
wrong with it as a question. If they posted something like, "Why don't
you play DAoC since EQ sucks?" THAT I would understand as a troll. But
if DAoC is a hell of a lot like EQ, it is an innocent question.

Well since I was being thought of as a 'detractor' it seems, I'm sorta
curious why you (collective) would give a rat's ass about what they
think.

I wasn't set straight until about 4-6 posts into the thread. I was
attacked plain and simple.

And I wasn't boasting, I was having a conversation with someone about
what was going on here. It's not boasting to say that someone kicked
me so I'm kicking them back, just not as hard.

It's the only thing I could think of and was asking for any other
thoughts.

Just because you say it doesn't make it so.

>"I can't get to EQ or its site, I think it was hacked!"

Actually it was:

Subject: EQ hacked?

"Can't get on a server, can't get on their website. Any clues?"

Notice the "Any clues?" part?

No, all you saw was the subject line and jumped like a rabid dog
thinking you were defending Sony's honor. Like Sony needs defending
from an insignificant (to them) Usenet poster.
