The characters I play that can't cast Bind Affinity have never
waited more than 5 or 10 minutes for a bind.  Perhaps you're not
asking politely enough?  *shrug*

Many moons ago, I started a wizard, in part because I wanted to
be able to port people around.  SoL killed the market.  At least
it did on *my* server.

I think the price should be reasonable; i.e., high enough to make

falls in the reasonable category or not.)

I'd try to balance it so rez types would still get a reasonable
amount of business, of course.
