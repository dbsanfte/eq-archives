I have a cable connection in the Netherlands, Europe, configured as a 1024
kbit/s downstream and 256 kbit/s upstream. With this connection, my ping is
roughly around the 200 ms (There is a 12.000 km difference between the
servers and me, which causes a 40 ms distance lag). With this ping, I have
absolutely no problem playing the game.

I have also played "on the road" with a 56 kbit/s modem (connects at 49.2
kbit/s, never higher) and I have experienced not much trouble there. Pings
around 300, and i still consider that very playable.

Further more, the only real issue is the quality of your phone-line, NOT the
quality of the provider. I have found that I had a lousy connection with one
dial-up provider, while the other (with a better backbone i suppose) had a
perfect connection.

So I suggest a provider change. I totally understand that DSL connections
and Cable connection are not widely available, and it is also a fact that
some cable providers have a worse ping response then a dial-up. My provider
used to have that problem, but they upgraded their cable-systems, and its
going perfect now. I used a dial-up when i wanted to play with my previous
cable connection, and that was working pretty good.

Of course, with a bad phoneline it doesn't matter which provider you choose.
But if you have a good phoneline, get the best provider you can get. Not the
cheapest.
