   Yes, that's all, and it's pretty critical to the argument at hand.  If
42 did not leave EQ because of the killstealing, then the whole argument
falls apart at this point.  I don't know why he left, but I'm going out on
a limb and guess it wasn't because of killstealing.

   I thought the article was interesting, but the author is making some
major assumptions about what "good in the long term" is.  Permadeath?  He
doesn't seem to consider the idea that many veteran players might consider
this to be a bad idea as well, that that it might harm a game's enjoyablity
in the long term.  His position seems to be "Newbies hate permadeath, I
think permadeath would be good in the long run, Thus newbies are
shortsighted fools who are ruining MMORPGs.  QED."  Same thing on
instancing.  There is comfortable middle ground, but he seems to ignore the
possibility altogether.

   All of his assumptions pretty much read that way to me.  It seems to me
that when he wrote that he was working with the underlying assumptions that
1) Newbies like features that are good in the short term but hurt the game
in the long term 2) Veterans want something else than the newbies 3) he
know what would be good in the long.

   I think it is impossible to design a world that everyone, or even all
veterans, would consider to be "just right".  People have different likes
and dislikes, and that doesn't change much no matter how long they've been
playing the games.
