Talking about spells and BST..

The latest patch from Verant was supposed to fix that "sicken and Tainted
Breath" spells should be aviable from a vendor in Shar Vahl.. Well.. I have
not found it..

Some posts i have seen is "it is supposed to be quested.. but it is
broken".. How is it supposed to be quested, and from whom? Anyone know?

CyberMax

PS. Yes.. i know that it is aviable in Innothule Swamp, Everfrost, Oggok..
But i am NOT there right now...
