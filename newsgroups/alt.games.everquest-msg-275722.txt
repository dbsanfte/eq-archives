I sympatize and agree, but being a weaponsmith, I was in the same boat. Most
recipes required one, two or even three (all) interim components from other
classes, most of which required third party help. Add to that, that each
metal thingy I can make myself required a temper for refining the metal and
another for crafting the component. On top of it all, the weapons I can make
are by no means special and better ones are found all over Norrath.

However, I found the challenges presented by the interdependencies
interesting and overcoming them rewarding, and I would have no problems with
them if:

... they were more or less the same for all classes
... getting in touch with partners were easier
... the end result were something of substantial value
