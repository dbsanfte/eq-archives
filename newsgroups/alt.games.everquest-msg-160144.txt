    Every leading guild seems to have killed one tier three boss, time two
weeks. So six weeks to clear them all and get all the needed stuff for tier
four.

    Three weeks for each of the tier four planes, and to gather needed quest
components to advance. This also assumes the quests are live. So 12 weeks
there.

    So 18 weeks from now until Plane of Time is entered. I'll do some
rounding and say mid-March, 2003.
