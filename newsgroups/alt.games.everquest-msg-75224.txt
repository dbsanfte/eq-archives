I just started playing the game on saturday and have a few questions on what
I should concentrate on.  I have gotten my SK up to lvl 14 slowly but
surely.  A nice halfling twinked me with a Dark Reaver which does nice
damage but seems slow.  Is there a better weapon I should use?  Also what is
some good armor to use that is either easy to find or relatively inexpensive
since I only have about 100pp.  What are some good areas to go to for xp at
my level?  I usually wander around solo with my pet and ask to group at
camps in EC,WC and desert of ro.  However, I fear wandering too far from
Neriak since I have died quite a few times so far.  My last qustion is are
there any quests I can go on yet?  I found the one in neriak at the rogue
guild but thats all so far.  Thanks in advance for any help.  By the way I
play under the name Gizven on Bristlebane if you want to team up or say hi.

Thanks,
Chris
