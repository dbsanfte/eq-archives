yes, a warlord is decisive for the ixiblat fight. If you don't have
one, try again next week, not worth risking all the work you did on
your epic till that point.
Also, Ixi is a pain to slow - but you should still try it, a landed
slow is a won fight.  Try to get at least one caster with mala/malo
and a tasher.  They will get aggro, so have them next to the MA so ixi
doesn't bounce. Then have shaman and chanters chain cast slows till it
lands. I haven't seen a failed Ixi fight on a slowed Ixi, but several
where the slow didn't land. So I have to correct that, I didn't
actually see those, I was sitting at my bindpoint mostly :).
