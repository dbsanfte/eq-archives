No way to do it yet. There is the /channel command but that only
works for the ones you could do already by right-clicking on the chat
box anyway.

Side note: Please keep the channel name as short as possible because it
sends the channel name for every tell. No sense in adding to the chat clutter.

Now if we can get Verant to change these messages:

You cannot see your target.
You cannot see your target.
You cannot see your target.
Your target is too far away, get closer!
Your target is too far away, get closer!
Your target is too far away, get closer!
You can't hit them from here.
You can't hit them from here.
You can't hit them from here.

To something like a flashing target icon on the screen. I swear to god
that my log is 1/3 full of just these messages. It gets worse the higher
level I get because I get better haste items and spells cast on me the
faster I can fill that chat window with my own battle spam.
