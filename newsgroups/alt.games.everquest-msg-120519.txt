Yes, you are missing something....

"Great" is a title. Titles are a no-no (Sir, The, Lady, Count, etc).

I once petitioned an obnoxious player with the stupid name of
"Treezwalkerz", because it was my understanding that 2-word names were
a violation. The GM who responded quoted directly from the naming
policy. He/She showed me that 2-word names are not always in
violation. Unless it is a clear violation, it comes down to the GM
making a judgement call.

2 nights ago I ran across a lowbie Ranger in Qeynos Hills named
"Comeonidareyou". So I took him up on his challenge and petitioned him
:-).
