First off, it is not just how much damage it does per hit, but also how often it
hits. Take the delay of your weapon and divide it by the damage; the smaller the
number, better.

I dunno. Rosewhite continued to melee until 19th level, when she got Careless
Lightning and started to blast kite (snare, run away, blast, run away, blast...
you get the idea.) Even then, she often (at first) would go OOM and have to melee
up close and personal before the mob was trying to flee. At higher levels (21,
22, 23), she still would melee when the mob turned to flee, in an effort to save
as much mana as possible (less time to med until full.) It wasn't until 24th
until she started using root/dot (ensnaring roots + creeping crud.)

One thing to remember is that every part of the Testament is no drop, which can
make it pretty difficult to get (not to mention the camp for Dyllan.) If you have
the means to twink out a wood elf druid, a very good start (IMO) would be to get
some imbued mithril reinforced armor for wisdom and charisma boosts. Imbued
mithril studded is not quite the AC but has the same stats otherwise, and would
probably be cheaper.

As for a weapon, I would recommend (trade skiller that I am) you try to get some
of the cultural smithed ones. The Koada'Dal Falchion of Tunare is a scimitar with
7 dmg, 24 dly (ratio 3.425), magic with +3 STR and +3 WIS, worshippers of Tunare
only. The Mithril Fier'Dal Morning Star of Tunare is a 1HB with a damage of 9,
delay of 35, +4 AGI, +2 WIS and +2 CHA. There is also an imbued Fier'Dal
scimitar, but I don't have the stats on that.

The dark ember is a great weapon (1HB, damage 13, delay 32, +2 STR, +5 WIS, +7 vs
Fire, +20 HP, +20 mana, procs 14pt burn), and Rosewhite has a smouldering brand
(1HB, damage 9, delay 22, +3 STR, procs 14pt burn) she was gifted with many
levels ago, but both are pretty expensive (smouldering brand is about 1.5k and
dark embers can go for 4k or more.) The cultural smithed I mentioned above would
be much cheaper if you are looking for stats.

On a tight budget, you can easily find non-stat enhancing magic weapons such as a
Cold Iron Morning Star (9 dmg, 35 dly 1HB off of Goblin Preacher in Permafrost)
or Screaming Mace (8 dmg, 35 dly 1HB given in quest in Crushbone.)
