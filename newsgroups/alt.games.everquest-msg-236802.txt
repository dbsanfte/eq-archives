Ok so today I hit level 9, and I've decided to go to Eruds Crossing
and hunt/fish there for a few days, it's nice and quiet, just a few
cat people running around here and there, and the occasional zombie or
madman.

Anyways, the fishing there is usuallt pretty good, lots of rusty
daggers, a few sandles and some good fish.

Just curious to see where your favorite spot to fish is, and if you
wouldn't mind sharing with us, how to get there.

Natimbi is nice I hear, but honestly I don't have the first clue on
how to get there.  Any other places?
