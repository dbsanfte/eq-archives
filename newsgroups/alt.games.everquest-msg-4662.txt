Everyone else covered the wonders of smithing in Freeport, so I'll
cover the faction part.

Kill orcs in EC (9 is just about the right level for that)
Collect DF belts. Hand in belts to either the guy in the second floor
of the warrior guild (Good guy faction) or to the Militia captain
('bad' guy faction), both in WFp. Giving belts to one will lower
faction with the other; I gave mine to the warrior.
Collect orc pawn picks, 4 at a time. Hand them in to Tohsahn Hallard
in EFp, IIRC that gives only positive faction hits.
Deliver letters between EFp and WFp. In the hidden rooms underneath
the Freeport docks, you can find Harkin Duskfoot who has a letter for
Janam, and  Nestral T'Gaza who has a letter for Rebby. Rebby and Janam
are in WFp near the theater of tranquil. Give them their letters, and
take what they give you back to Harkin and Nestral respectively for
only positive faction hits. You can also find Gren Frikniller in the
same area under EFp, deliver something to his sister Falia Frikniller
in NFp (halfling in market area on a piece of lawn), return what she
gives you to Gren and get positive faction hits.
I am amiable to everyone in Freeport except the militia (apprehensive)
and the guilds from doing this for a while.

You might also want to get some cheap charisma gear (a crude stein,
for starters) for when you buy and sell.
