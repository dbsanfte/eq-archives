When did I ever claim this? Never. Not once. What I *am* saying is that
these situations WILL HAPPEN. And they won't be rare either. I'm also
saying THAT NEITHER SIDE WILL HAVE ANY FUN. It is immaterial to me which
side wins, because I do not, and will never play DAoC...the beta was bad
enough, you think I'd actually pay to endure that shitty game?
