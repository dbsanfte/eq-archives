Oh I should add something before I go to play. (yes, its an EQ night)

This thread stayed flame free because Lokari, Jeremiah, and Jazz made
intelligent arguments and had a willingness to debate for longer than
most people can stand it.

That's worth pursuing. That it lasted as long as it did is just
memorable for the fact that no fuckwits jumped in.

Of course, in the end, one did. So he gets the treatment HE deserves.
It would have been the same if he had been there from the start.

I couldn't care less if that hurts my argument in yours or anyone's
eyes. My arguments will stiill stand or fall on their merits, not my
presentation, when all is said and done. Abusing fuckwits is just as
much a hobby as debating intelligent people. God knows THIS newsgroup
should be used to that....
