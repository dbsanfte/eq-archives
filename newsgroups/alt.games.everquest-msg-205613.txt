 We were bored and did Veksar last week. Great fun but probably too high
for you. For a group of 65s this place wasn't a problem. And it really
was a crawl, with fast respawns. This zone could easily keep 50 XP
groups occupied. Or at least it seemed that way from my time there. The
XP was comparable to similar Kunark zones of the level range but it
wasn't PoP XP. I think the loot is what will keep people coming here and
not the XP. The only annoying thing is campers complaining about you
killing mobs as you move through.

 At 40.. Hmm try Guk. Crawling to Lord or King may be a bit hard with
level 40s but never know until you try. Todays level 40s are better
equipped than three years ago. Dalnirs and Kaesora work although they
may be a bit too easy except for going down to church and doing Xalgoz.
A few more levels try hitting City of Mist and crawl to the reavers up
top. You don't have to kill them but you can try fighting to there and
just lev off to zone when done Droga would be a good one for a group but
I'm not sure I can really recommend it. There's a reason why nobody ever
goes there.
