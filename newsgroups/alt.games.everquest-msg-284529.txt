W00t! Alts do, in fact, rock. :P

The new race does interest me as well, but the one sticking point, as you 
mention, is the presence of insane twink gear on the normal servers. Remove 
that (hell, take it from my own moderately twinked alts in the process) and 
I'm back on Stromm faster than a dwarven warrior can chug a mug o' mead. 
It's just no fun when you're only motivation is to grind out levels to 
catch up with the gear you've been using since you rolled, or to farm money 
to *buy* stuff that will put you in that very same boat.

The Combine is awesome. It truly is a return of when I started playing EQ 
with much of The Vision's (TM) dark side improved. Each class is still able 
to make meaningful contributions to encounters without the inflationary ill 
effects of high-end class progression and itemization.

I have seen the future of EQ, and it is it's past - at least for me, 
anyway. :P
