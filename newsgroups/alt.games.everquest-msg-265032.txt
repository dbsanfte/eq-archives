Not that I like SoE or that I even plan to play EQ2, but if you think
patch code can't dork up a perfectly stable system you're going to be
sorely disappointed in every apsect of technology.

I've seen rock-stable software get dorked because of a patch to add a
new feature or even fix a previous bug.  It happens, even if the code
was "gold" up to that point.

And there's nothing to indicate the current code is stable anyway, so
it's a double whammy.  But it's not restricted to anything alpha.
