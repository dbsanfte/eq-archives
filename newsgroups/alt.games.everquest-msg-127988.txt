I could give the same source to 10 different people, ask them to compile
it and it would probably result in 10 different executables depending on
what and how many compiler switches were used during the compile. It is
much easier to simply look at the code and determine if it does what it
says it does... Then, if you want to compile it yourself, you can "play"
with compiler switches, optimizers etc. to get the smallest fastest
running code.. I prefer a quick glance at the code and running it
through a virus program. In Mr. Tibbett's case, as I know his previous
work, I do a simple visual scan of the code.
