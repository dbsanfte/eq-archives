What truth? That they're trying to make money? Gee, why all figured
that out long ago. You're pretty slow on the uptake...

And, considering you've sold 3 accounts for a total of about $1200 by
your own admission, you have *NO* room to talk about greed, snotty
little mommy's boy.

>certainly passed the verant brainwashing test with flying colors I must say!

Mind trying that last line again after you've had a few grammar
lessons so we can all figure out what the hell it is you're saying
there? "Me either you people have..."? Say what?
