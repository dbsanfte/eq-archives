It's been brought up before, in fact. I suggested that a new NPC (say,
"Guild Quartermaster") be added in every bank; when selected, your
character is parsed for the guild tag and <your guild> bank inventory
is opened. It would seem to me that such a thing would be fairly easy
to code, as it would inherit most of its functions from existing code.
This would allow my non-porting character in Freeport to move
something to another player's non-porting character in Thurg without
one or the other of us having to endure a long, annoying, possibly
dangerous trip or enlisting the aid of a third party.

However, it seems terribly unlikely that such a thing would happen,
for at least two reasons. GMs would be endlessly annoyed by players
complaining that "I put Uber_Craploot_01 in the guild bank for Skippy
Peanutbutterpants and someone else took it without permission", etc.;
it would also make transfers between characters on a single account
entirely trivial (Main puts object/plat in guild bank, Alt logs in and
takes it out again). Flagging items and plat for withdrawal by a
specific character would solve the first problem, but be substantially
more work to program; no easy solution to the second problem occurs to
me.

The (utility to the guild) vs. (potential problems for VI) ratio seems
to argue against seeing a guild bank anytime soon.
