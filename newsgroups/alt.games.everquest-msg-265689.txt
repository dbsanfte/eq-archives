And going the amount of post-election gloating and taunting the 
conservatives are doing, it's going to get a lot more divided over the 
next four years -- particularly if the rumours of an upcoming purge of 
moderates in the administration come true.

I have to say that, while I'm not happy about the result, it does have a 
very definite silver lining: It's obvious that Kerry wasn't going to cut 
and run in Iraq, but he'd have to deal with the mess he was handed -- 
this way, when the American coffins keep flying back home in ever-
increasing numbers, for no discernible benefit other than to Halliburton 
executives, at least there is no chance of the blame sticking to the 
wrong guy due to people having short memories.

But on the whole, I'm afraid this is the episode where America jumped 
the shark.
