Just wondering if anyone here participated in the EQ tournament at Gencon
this past week. All week long (at least on Mith Mar server) the Tip of the
day (you know that yellow message from the GM that pops up when you log in)
talked about the "Massive" tournament at Gancon (Yup they even spelled it
wrong). I was at Gencon on Thursday and stopped by the Sony booth at around
3 in the afternoon to find 4 computers (I guess 4 people playing EQ at 1
time is a Massive tournament), and no one playing yet as they appeared to be
having some "Technical Difficulties".  So anyway, did anyone here get in on
the fun? Did they finally get things running?

Steve
