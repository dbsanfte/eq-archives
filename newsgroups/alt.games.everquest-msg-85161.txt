    Glad I didn't rush down to Verant's HQ to turn
in my application, then.  I can just imagine how 
the job interview would go after that gig folded.
   
   "So, what did you do at your last position"
   "Well... I was a CSR in an on-line game 
environment called Everquest.  It was my job 
to make the gaming experience dynamic and 
rewarding for customers  paying a premium price
for a higher level of service."
   "I see.  Why did you leave that position?"
   "Well, turns out we just weren't that good
at it and all the customers quit...."
