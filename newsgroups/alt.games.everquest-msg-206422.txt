This would be a hellva lot more useful if you didnt stop LFG everytime you
zoned.

I play a beastlord as my main, so when I cant find a group I go solo, or
farm, it becomes very annoying having to keep putting my LFG tag back on,
and I can be sure to miss doing it at least once during a hunting trip
resulting in me wandering around wondering why I cant get a group only to
discover i'm no longer LFG.

Also has anyone found if they camp out LFG when they come back in they are
listed in the LFG tool, but only visable to everyone but yourself? Happened
to me a few times.
