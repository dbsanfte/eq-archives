I have to admit that I am impressed with most of the posters to this topic.
Most of the replies have been very mature and responsable to respond to the
topic all be it those who disapprove of the buying and selling of accounts
in general, did voice it but then they went on to provide a mature responce.

Makes me feel real good to see that kind of character on here.

As to my thoughts on this topic, it has been said already by previous
posters.

Dave
