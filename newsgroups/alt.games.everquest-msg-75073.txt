Had a lot fun in EW with the following group

Druid
Shaman
Shaman
Cleric
Magician
Bard

A couple of high level farmers trained the Rygorr Chief (who was very
red to us) and 3 other orcs onto us, but we killed them all. The bard
and one shaman died during the fight though. Cheif dropped a nice
piece of armor, but I didn't win the roll :-(
