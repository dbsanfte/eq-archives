Reminds me of something I heard as a guildie and I were fighting the low
level dead froggies near the L Guk zone.  Some guy was toying with a mob in
the Ass Sup room, keeping it alive until someone in his guild could get
there to claim the no-drop prize (IIRC, mask of deception).  He had already
been doing this for ten minutes when we got there, and there was a group
that wanted the room.  How does everyone see this?  I think it was a bit
assinine, even though it's legal.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
