I think your assumption cheats the question.  My 56 cleric does often heal
for more than that, but does not often group with everyone the same level.
In fact I would say that 2925 is an average heal and no where near the max
heal.  And I consider myself to be a cautious cleric starting ch at 50%.
Many would say to wait for more efficiency.

Not sure from this post which of you may be arguing that clerics are
obsolete, but I'd just like to chime in with my bards opinion that they are
both good healers and welcome in my groups perhaps even if we have one or
the other already.
