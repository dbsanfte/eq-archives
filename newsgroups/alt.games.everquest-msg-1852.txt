Your understanding of the rules is correct.

However, there are ALWAYS enough places to hunt...even on the most crowded
server, The Rathe (finally being split this week...yay!).  There are many
"prime" spots.  Many of them are camped nearly all the time.  Particular
camps are harder to get into than others, but that does not mean you need to
force your way in.

Although it's within your rights to force someone to share a spawn, by the
time this is an issue you'll be of high enough level where people start
remembering your name.  If you expect my group to share a spawn we've been
hoping will pop these last 10 hours you can also be sure that you're name
will be on my shit list...and so will your guild's if they back you up when
I contact them.

But yeah, you're within your rights to force the issue...just don't be
surprised if you're name is Mud after that. :)
