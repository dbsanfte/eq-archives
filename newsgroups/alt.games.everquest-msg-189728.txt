Asshole.  GM was trying to help, you may not have wanted it but you should
have simply pointed that out so he could port you back.  GM's DON'T CAMP
SHIT.  THEY'RE NOT REGULAR PLAYERS.  THEY DON'T STEAL CAMPS.  Idiot.
Fucking moron.  You're retarded by conscious choice and you drool.
Disgustingly.

Hmm, secret magic land sounds cool, but on a random guess I'd saying you're
lying through your teeth, though I don't know why the hell you would... or
if you're not lying... well, I don't like you.  I'm also in an extremely bad
mood.  And I have to agree with LAN, you were probably dropped on your head
repeatedly as a child, though I think it was probably a sledgehammer used
afterwards, not a ball peen hammer.  Anyway, like I said, I'm in an
extremely bad mood, so that's why I'm bitching at you like this.  Sorry.
Actually no I'm not.
