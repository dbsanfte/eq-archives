Hi,

just seen Everquest Europe+Kunark+Velious+SoL
for just 4,90 EUR. Now if that isn't a good
reason to start ...

I read the FAQ and googled a bit, but still
have some gameplay questions.
In the past i've played on some minor MMORPGS
(Tibia, Wyvern), but they can't keep me
motivated :-/

Please note that this isn't meant to be a rant
agains EQ in any way. I just seek a game which
suits my needs, which may be a bit excentric ;-)

Questions:
1) "Evil Players". From what i've read PKing
is completely optional in EQ, but what about
lurers, looters, thiefs... how many
annyoing/dangerous people would i meet in EQ?
I prefer purely cooperative gameplay.

2) Risk
I tend to play games like an interactive movie,
not as a test of my player skills. And i hate
losses. Can i play EQ in a way that can pretty
much guarantee me my char won't die, and still
advance ?
(died about 5 times in 5 years in tibia, where a
death costs 7% XP and 10% per equipped item that
its dropped)

3) Leveling threadmill
I tend to play games like an interactive movie,
not as a test of my diligence. I want to explore
new areas, find interesting items, and kill a
monster or two (like you do in single-player RPGs).
There should allways be a wide selection of
different huntable monsters, and different explorable
areas without spending days on training first.

4) "Downtimes"
Can you play in a continouus way without
regeneration/repairing pauses?

5) Groups
I'd like to play alone most the time, and
sometimes join a group.

6) Level usefullness
I tend to level slower than my friends.
Can a low level still be helpfull to a high
level group ?

7) Battle system
Reading about monsters hitting through walls, ignoring
height, and hitting from impossible places sounds
awfull in theory. How does this affect the actual
gameplay? Can you do ANY tactics (like hide behind
walls, ranged attack on melee monsters from places
they can't reach, etc) in the battles ?

8) Speed
Having a first person perspective ... is
EQ as quick as 3D shooters, or a less
hectical experience ?

9) Lag
How much Lag or server inavailabilites
do i have to expect (german user on ADSL)

10) Extensions
How much will i miss as a newbie by not
owning PoP, LoY and LDoN ?

thanks a lot for helping me :-)
