Not sure on that quest myself, but there tend to be an ungodly amount of 45+
PC in FoB most of the time at night, you may wanna try getting a ride from
one of them or make arrangement with a Druid to meet you at the rings in EJ
just off of FoB.  At least this is my experience from being on Brell.  Hope
this helps.
