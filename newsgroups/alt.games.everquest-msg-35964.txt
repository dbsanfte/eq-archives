Actually, I got a kick out of the clip - it wasn't all ToV and VS. I
saw Venril Sathir, who my guild has taken out 3 or 4 times in the past
couple of weeks. Also, some scenes from Sebilis including those darn
shrooms! I still need to get revenge on the shroom king!

Anyhow, there were definitely some non-uber scenes shown! :-)
