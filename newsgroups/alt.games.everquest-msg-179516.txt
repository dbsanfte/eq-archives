I'm claiming to have a basic understanding of maintaining a
high-traffic network and also enough common sense to know that the
world itself has grown, requiring more machines per "world" along with
the user base growing. EQ was running at several dollars per month
below the average fee for online games at the time they increased
their rates, despite the fact that they were the biggest and had the
most expansive world.
