Ok, there's supposed to be a quest NPC in the E. FP tunnels who asks for
a cyclops eye.  Now, over the last year or so, I've killed a lot of
fucking cyclops, from the regular variety in Rathe Mtns. to the named
Broon and Co. in the Karanas, to the PH for the AC, to the AC himself,
and the Seafuries. I've never seen this drop. Is it even in the game?
