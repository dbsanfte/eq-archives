If you have luclin, and pop, it is easy to reach.  On the south wall of the
newbie grounds in west freeport, behind the 3 cacti, you will find a false
wall.  Go in a little ways and you should see a book on a pedestol(sp).
Click the book and you will be at Plane of Knowlege.  Wander around.  It is
safe.  You will find the Nexus point in due time.  From Nexus book, follow
tunnel out to main chamber, turn right to next tunnel.  Before following
that one, turn your clipping plane to zero to reduce lag.

Have fun.  If you don't have pop, take boat from East Freeport to
Butcherblock mnts.  Follow paths to greater Feydark.  You will know the
Nexus Scion when you see the giant spires.  Hail Her and follow her
instructions.

If you don't have Luclin, well, you can't go to Bazaar then at all.

Good luck my young Padiwa.
