My guild is finally to the point where we can start considering doing some
raiding.  Of course it will be Kael and CoM and the like for the forseeable
future, but still, we are really starting to get our stuff together...

We have been talking about doing the DKP system and I would like those of you
that know what I'm talking about and have had experience with this system to,
if you would, tell me your feelings.  How did your guild decide what was worth
which points, etc...  and over all, how did it go?

Thank you in advance for your help gang...
