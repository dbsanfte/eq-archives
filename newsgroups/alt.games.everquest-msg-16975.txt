Can anyone enlighten me what pixie dust is used for!, was a guy 
on Lanys T`Vyl WTB at 20 pp for a stack last night..  Annoyed 
me somewhat because I had just got rid of some to a trader for
the usual coppers because I though they were useless.

Up to now the most lucrative thing I have managed to sell is
bat wings at 2 pp per stack.
