Yes, I agree, it is very sad news for rangers, I would like to add that the
only happens at the end game, where archery is no longer viable as dps, and
pretty much EVERYONE is doing huge dps because of the damage of there
weapons.

Oh, we get spells :P I forgot :D I use snare, root, SoT, SoP, Eagle eye, and
two nukes...out of an entire spelll book thats kinda sad.

A shadowknights spell book, for example, has a much better range of useful
spells.

But that is  a different topic entirely ;p
