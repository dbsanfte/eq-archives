No matter which recipe you choose to make celestial essense it turns out to
be the same exact product, so no, it doesn't matter. The easiest recipe imo
is The Scent of Marr + celestial solvent. This is because you can buy scent
of marr from vendors in unlimited amounts.

The vendors are

Ak'Anon
a clockwork merchant @ 1075, -1040, Library Mechanamagica, next to Tergon
Brenclog

East Commonlands
Lyth Spellstar @ 270, 4912, -48, next to 3rd inn

Plane of Knowledge
Loran Thu`Leth @ -115, 1407, Western trader building

South Qeynos
Hanlore Escaval @ 305, -565, Inside The Herb Jar
