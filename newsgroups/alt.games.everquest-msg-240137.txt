... You had to let a pally or SK tank for you? I played a warrior both
before and after the melee changes at all levels and never once did I
have to have a gimp hybrid tank for me. I did have situations where a
gimp hybrid couldn't manage THEIR agro though. Always gotta love the
insta-snare idiot of an SK or the chain-stunning pally. Shamans were
never a problem except at high levels where they want to become lazy
fucks and not malo before slow and wonder why they pick the mob out of
their teeth. The funny part is.. for all the taunt spells given
hybrids.. your typical caster can rip mobs off them too if they were
inclined.
