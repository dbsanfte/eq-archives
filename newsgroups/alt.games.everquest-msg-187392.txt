Put XP on it and forget about the pile'o'shite that is Windows98.
Having said that, I run EQ on XP (Pro) and W98 without any problems
whatsoever, although strangely everyone is currently nekkid on the W98
machine, apart from the occasional piece of armour.

I'm not even sure that you need the application compatibility toolkit
any more, now that EQ runs in a window.  IIRC, originally it was only
required to disable the Windows key, which would cause EQ to disappear
instantly if you inadvertently hit it.  No problems with windowing
here, EQW style or SOE style.
