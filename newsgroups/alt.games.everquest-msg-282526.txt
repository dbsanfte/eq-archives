I've said it before in this group, and will say it again.  The game is
better for the "casual" player now than it ever has been in the past.  With
the multitude of single-group-obtainable items that rival the highest raid
drops of a couple expansion ago, the "gear gap" is easy to overcome.

MMs, doable by any idiot (and trust me when I say that I know this for a
fact...), give elemental level gear.  DoN missions, doable in MM/bazaar
gear, give Time level gear.  DoD missions, doable in DoN gear, give GoD
level gear.

I think OoW, DoN and DoD are fantastic values for non-raiders.  There is a
*ton* of single-group content in those three expansions.

You're right, there are more 70-80 mobs than anything below 45.  The
corollary is that there are more level 70 players than anything below 45. 
Sony is just satisfying the market.
