I never understood the paranoia over running the river in FV. Yeah,
the spiders are nasty if you aggro one. But, in my experience, I've
never had a problem giving them a wide clearance. You actually have to
pay attention... The boat's a minor issue. It could take just as long
to do the spire hop as it can to catch the boat.

As for a SK "wandering" Paineel newbie yard, I've never seen him. If
you mean Noclin, he stays in one spot. And he is on normal Heretic
faction, so he does still start off KOS to most folks. Hunting in
Warrens long enough will change that, though.
