Starting last night, I began having random freezes while playing EQ. I can
still hear background music, spells being cast, etc. but the screen is
completely frozen. I haven't had this problem before, and have changed
nothing about my hardware before the problem began. I was just wondering if
anyone else has had this problem, and if so were you able to correct it, and
how.

Thanks in advance,
