The current discussion of "How to get the AC to spawn?" has prompted
another question in my mind.  Has anyone here actually seen King Xorbb
spawn in the gorge? And more importantly, has anybody ever
discovered/heard of some trick or method to trigger the spawn?
   I have been on several long camps there at earlier levels for xp,
loot and the random nice drop. Last night after a group of guildmates
suddenly had to camp and leave in Runnyeye while we were exploring
there, I decided to head over to kill time by popping the EE's and see
if I would get lucky on a drop. (Yes, zero xp unless the King or the big
named Lord popped, so technically I was "farming". However, if some
lower levels had shown up wanting to hunt eyes, I had already decided
that I would immediately give them the camp and just retire for the
night if they could get xp off them.)
  Anyway, I probably killed them for about 45 minutes or an hour, (and
only one stupid PBH the whole time....... cheap bastards..... grrrrr),
which I know is *no time at all* for a gorge camp, and as usual, no
King.  But I *have* done it for as much as eight hours in the past and I
have only once ever even seen the lvl 30 Lord spawn.  I would really
like to get the ring off the King for one of my wife's caster
characters, but I'm almost thinking this guy has been taken out of the
game, or moved someplace else, or is just an EQ Urban Legend.
  Anybody have any insight on him? I'd sure like a crack at him just
once.
