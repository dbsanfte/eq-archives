I'm a EQ surfer and believe this is the case on test.  As you mentioned
originally, it's not just KEI, it's all those high level buffs that people
get around the level limit by casting them in a group.  I think the change
is coming, whether it's now or six months from now.  Cheap KEI in the nexus
is another one of those things that will topple from its own weight.  "Level
5 wizard with KEI LFG".  "Level 13 Cleric with KEI LFG".  That can't go on
forever.
