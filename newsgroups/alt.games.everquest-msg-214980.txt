The dictionary definition of illegal is: prohibited by law.
It is not prohibited to break a contract by law, ie no law says breaking 
a contract is illegal.

For what its worth, lots of things that are not illegal have legal 
recourse. When found guilty of a crime, for example, you have, as a 
legal recourse, the right to appeal, provided you have grounds. Being 
found guilty, of course, isn't illegal. (Yes I know its a bit obtuse to 
the debate, but my point is that there are several instances where 
recourse is granted without the act precipitating the recourse being 
illegal itself.)

Similiarly, when you break a contract, the other party is legally 
entitled to reparations for any resultant damages. But breaking a 
contract isn't in and of itself illegal, the fact of a legal recourse 
doesn't change that.

As someone else noted, some contracts need to be broken, some contracts 
are broken voluntarily by both parties, and the law is carefully written 
to ensure that the act of breaking a contract isn't illegal.
