Some people appreciate it. I was back seat driving in a goup, last one they
added to get to 6. Group leader got killed twice and one of the other
members took a dirt nap in the first 10 minutes while I am "NO!", "DON'T DO
THAT!", "DON'T argue with the chanter!" and coaching in between pulls. After
the two deaths and an unlootable lost corpse in the artwork the group leader
disbanded and logged.

I got the nod for group leader by popular acclaim and it ended up being one
of my longest group sessions ever, probably 4 hours straight. I think 3
people made a level that night and only one death in 4 hours due to a LD.

People have a tendancy to make poor choices in the heat of battle. Necro
that night didn't have his pet in '/pet guard here' mode and it goes running
off after a cripple to '/pet summon train'. So he runs off after it while
maybe 6 mobs add on it! I'm doing the frigging "LET IT GO! ZONE! ZONE NOW!"
and he is fighting me. Finally took something along the lines of "It' just
freaking bone chips, ain't worth dying!" and he got out.

He cooperated really well after that. I asked him to put his pet in 'guard
here mode', we pulled, the chanter mezzed and people backed off the mezzes,
we killed. I mostly nuked cripples since no one else wanted to do any
snaring or anything other then nuke until oom then med, we racked up
experience and loot. I almost added several people to my friends list.
