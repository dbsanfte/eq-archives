Do you have a Via chipset? Some motherboards with Via chipsets perform fine,
some horribly.
Also try turning off sound with the nosound file trick (look under tech
support on the eqlive site it should be in there somewhere.). I've seen the
soundcard pull 20-30fps off of a machine in certain circumstances.
When you installed the Radeon card, did you use a detonator driver remover?
Sometimes video card drivers can screw each other up if they are not
completely removed.
Are you using the latests Catalyst drivers? (3.5 I believe)
Are you using DirectX 8.1 or 9?
Finally, though it should be performing better than you are indicating, EQ
doesn't generally perform as well as, say, Star Wars Galaxies or Dark Age of
Camelot, and none of the MMOG's perform as well as your First Person
shooters tend to, because of the huge variety of models/textures they have
to support.

Also, try going into your Radeon's control panels, and disabling
Smoothvision.
