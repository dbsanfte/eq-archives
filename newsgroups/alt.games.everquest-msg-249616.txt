On my beastlord, yep, Dark blue and yellow,  Solo.  I know mages and
necros that can do the same.

Attempt the similar 3 man group in a level 60 plus dungeon.  I don't
think you will get the same results.

Really depends on your class of choice on what you can solo "level
appropriately".

The only thing I really want is my summoners boon item... from a Tak
camp.

See where the difference is... the points I get, are used to Purchase
an Item from a Merchant, not some drop in a dungeon of XXX mob.  These
Merchants are merchants yes?  Most merchants want to get items for
their customers... why not have them trade between camps for items...
at a possibly premium to get items.

Look, I get it... I would prefer it to be the way I described... I
don't expect the change... nor wait for the possibility of the change.
I go where the adventure is... I don't force the adventure to where I
want to be.

bitter ya, sure... ill buy that one..

Sure, Ill agree with that....  but still would like to use my points
where ever I want.  or rather, wish the items I want were sold on all
Adv Merchants, for gods sakes they are all part of the same
brotherhood, and there is a friggen magus there to port stuff between
camps..... its not like they don't talk to each other.....    but
again, I don't expect it , nor wait for the possibility.     I would
like to see solo content for LDoN points.  Id rather not have to force
others to go to some specific camp, to get what I want.

been fun chatting... good hunting 42... by the way,  what's the
question?
