On a Celery 300A my zone time was about 30-60secs, since the patch I'd say
its gone to 40-70secs...and unlike previously zoning repeated across one
zone line back and forth without much travel gets faster......

That suggests to me that while there is more processor time there also
something memory wise going on, be it caching of recent textures or
keeping them in memory, and it really hasnt hit my processor to badly...
