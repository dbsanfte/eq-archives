 And probally know how Soe operates which brings up questions about
why partner with them?

 Backing from where? Seems like the very place they left.

 For now. Maybe Soe gets a little lazy in the distribution channel and
Sigil starts t go under but is bought out by Sony.

 http://www.verant.com/ Click this link, It says it all.

 They owned the Everquest property when they put out EQ2 which mean
100% 'cut'. Any while it sound dramatic, the common stereotype of mob
geting involved in businesses usually starts off with 'distribution'
then to 100% ownership. Soe won't used the same tatics but they'll get
the same outcome if vanguard even looks like it could compete with EQ.

 With EQ experience I have no intention of buying the software only to
find out the game got tainted by Soe. Been there, spent that, never
again.
