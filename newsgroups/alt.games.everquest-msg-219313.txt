It has 30 second cycle initially, additional AAs can reduce that to
9 seconds (faster than any of my current stun spells, IIRC).

30 minute dungeon expiration timer starts on success, so max 30 minute
wait (plus a couple for the server to get around to spawning your
corpse, don't understand that delay myself).  It is not unusual, IME,
to see Clerics cleaning up part of the corpse pile that marks the
dungeon entrances.

Must be nice.  Not only are 34 pt. missions "low end" to you, but you
are doing 51 pt missions faster than my weaker pickup groups can do
the 21 pt missions.  :-p

I love having an Enchanter in the group.  First, my groups don't usually
crush the dungeons at anywhere near the pace you do (pickup groups are,
well, they're pickup groups), which means having C2 available when KEI
wears off one caster or another is very handy.  Second, having a mezzer
is really useful when you don't have any idea whether the Shaman has the
gear/defense/experience to be a first rate root parker (it's pretty sad,
IMO, when the Shaman begs the AM3 Ranger to off-tank a single add).
And, most importantly, the only RL friend I have playing EQ right now
has only one character high enough to group with Kaev in LDoN, and he's
an Enchanter.
