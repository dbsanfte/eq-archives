So far I've done in part or fully -
2 monk epics
2 cleric epics (second cleric is at the solb rage camp stage now)
Upto 9th ring (including a 20 hour camp of gloradain)
AC (camped his ass for 27 hours)
Tormax - camped him for 3 days straight (work in the day, camping at night),
on the 4th day he popped an hour b4 I got home from work...  I still cry
about that 1

Theres a lot more too.. plus of course raiding almost every single day, and
a lot of exping (various level 60's, helping friends ding 60 etc) - point
being, I work fulltime.  Not a single other person has my password

Btw to answer one of your questions about it popping while your at work - if
a friend/guildie kills it, 9 times out of 10 it can be multi-quested  (ie
theres a 3 item handin.. he hands in item 1, you hand in items 2+3, you get
the reward)

MQ's don't work when something has to be combined in a container (i have nfc
about the druid epic) but generally your good
