Do you have any clue what that truely means?  It's about pride, not about
money.  The "eye of a needle" to which Christ referes was a term for the
city gates in Jeruslehem.  They were tall enough for a man to walk through,
but not a camel.  In order to get a camel through, one had to make it kneel,
which is a position of humility.

A rich man would tend to be prideful, because of the things he has.  As a
result, it would be difficult for him to set aside his pride and give
himself to God, so that he may enter into the kingdom of heaven.

That verse has absolutely nothing to do with the idea that Jesus may have
been a liberal.
