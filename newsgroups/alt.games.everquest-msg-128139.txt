    Snippage. I wish that a feature was added to every zone: if a mob's
Z-coordinate reached a certain number (ie. it fell beneath the world), it
would be warped to a set spot within the zone. So that stuff that falls
beneath the world doesn't just disappear until a GM resets it, but rather
ends up at a spot where it can path back home (or at least be found by a
tracker).
