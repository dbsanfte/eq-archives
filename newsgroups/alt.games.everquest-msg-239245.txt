Correction to the correction:  Whistling Fists have been considered by 
some to be the Iksar monk epic. This is because Celestial Fists are 
substantially harder for a lizard to get, and Whistling Fists are much 
harder for a human.  The quests were also (probably) added at the same 
time (although not solved at the same time, and WF may have been bugged 
for a while).  Anyway, it seems reasonable to me to consider them both 
epics.  What, about a quest that requires a handin to Cazic Thule himself, 
could possibly -not- be epic? :)

Of course, a really devoted monk should get both. :)
