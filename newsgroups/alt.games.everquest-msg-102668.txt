What is so tragic about suicide? He obviously suffered a lot during his life
and now he is free from that. It was his choice and we should respect it.
The only "tragedy" is that our  society does not accept this and feels the
need to blame something or someone for the personal choice of the suicidee.
Parents feel anguish as they try to blame themselves, or something else as
in this case. Why can't people accept the fact that depressives suffer, do
not enjoy the suffering and may choose to end it?

Imagine the most unpleasant experience you have had - say a divorce or death
of a loved one. When your depressed your thought process give you the same
feelings all the frigging time for no or very little apparent cause. Someone
who has gone half a decade or more of this sort of shit without finding a
way to cope will most proberly find a way to end it, and it will be a chance
for them to find peace (to "not think") rather than some great travesty. Of
course, if they do find a way to cope with it then that is even better.

I have lived my entire adult life with severe depression and hardly a day
goes by without me weighing up the pro's and con's of suicide, and my lifes
been pretty good to me as well. There's just this part of my brain that
causes me to see things differently to other people - albiet very darkly. It
is also the part of my brain that enables me to have my odd sense of
humour - paradoxly. I wouldn't have one without the other.

Though I still think he was rather impolite, there are lots of civilised way
to end your life without taking a firearm and redecorating a room with your
grey matter for someone else to find and clean up afterwards. There's a good
argument for the gun control lobby if I ever saw one; if we all only had
rolled up newspapers laying around at home, even though the world wouldn't
be more peaceful it would at least spend a lot less on dry cleaning.
