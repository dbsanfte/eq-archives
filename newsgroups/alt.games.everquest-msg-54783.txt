I know at least one friend of mine will, a lvl 51 cleric on Vazaelle.

The whole of Caer (the biggest uberguild) on Vazaelle won't go, plus anyone
who is training up for membership (I have 2 peeps in my guild who will leave
for CC when they hit 50 or such).

I myself have not decided. I am already invited to the "uberguild" which is
already forming for AB. If I do decide I will probably be raiding every
dragon and plane in the first 2 weeks.
It would mean leaving all my friends and reputation behind on vazaelle which
is really hard to do.
