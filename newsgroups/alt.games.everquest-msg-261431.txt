I'm going to have to find myself a copy of those rips. Whats the 
resolution of Laserdisc vs DVD? A VHS rip doesn't look too great. 

My favourite version was the THX release, after the sound was remastered 
but before the revisions started pouring in. Was that only released on 
VHS??

One can only pray that after the bastard dies someone will release a dvd 
set of the original movies in their original form.
