    Depending on what they're casting, about that. Draughts are three
seconds. Point being they miss that tick of medding, more often than not.

    BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Let's look at some simple numbers for a typical
situation - single targets, mezzed mobs so no rain for better efficiency,
enchanter only. Between 51 and 59, your average wizard is going to be
casting Draught of Something-or-other. You're looking at about 700 damage
for 215 mana. At max med rate he's getting back 25 mana per tick. C2 is
another 11 mana per tick. So that's 36 mana per tick, or six ticks (36
seconds) to recover fully. Assuming no resists, that's a *sustainable* DPS
of about 19.5 damage per second.

    Would you like to post your ranger's DPS with AQ on, Dennis? I bet you
have that beat quite nicely. And that's with your misses - I didn't assume
ANY resists, remember?

    As I said above, Graffe's has much better analysis than this. They throw
in average resist rates, allow for rains, factor in downtime (like when
nothing is in camp, the wizard is able to sneak in added ticks of medding
that add to his DPS), and many other variables. Trust me, they wanted
nothing more than to prove they were worth it in a pickup group. And they
couldn't.

    The most expensive spell I see you casting on a regular basis would be
something like Calefaction, which costs 15% more mana than a Draught and
which is FAR from your only damage contribution to the group. All the wizard
offers is his nukes and his ports.

    So you're offered proof, and decline it based on what, exactly?

    Wizards don't think they're weak - far from it. (Well, Grimstaff does,
but he's an outlier.) They know they are a raid staple class, that they also
form the core of the best XP group in the game - the AoE group - and that
they also solo about as well as a class can once they hit 29. The one area
they are weak in is getting into a pickup group that isn't constructed
specifically around them. I won't debate whether that's a reasonable
limitation or not because I've never played a wizard and don't know the
class well enough.

> Wizards make mobs die *now*.  That lets you clear areas faster

    WRONG. Higher DPS lets you clear an area faster, not "I nuked some of
them out, now I med while you fight with a five man crew." Wizards are good
at dropping that one mob that has to die, but they are poor at long-term
damage output.

    Between a cleric with a 400 mana Complete Heal and a slowdown of 60%+
with mezzes, XP mobs don't really put a strain on a healer. I've been bored
and FM with constant pulling in Velk's, no clarity, and ranger slowing.

    There's a world of difference between being a fair to strong damage
dealer like most melee classes are, and which usually also bring something
else to the table (buffs, heals, tanking ability), and a weak damage dealer
when it comes time to decide who to add to that random group in a random
zone. Again, I don't know how easy it is for a wizard to put together an AoE
group versus how easy it is for any other class to join a pickup group.
Judging by my guild's wizards, it isn't a fun profession if you like being
social.
