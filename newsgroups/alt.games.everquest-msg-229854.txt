From the shadows, the mysterious "@ndrew"

conspiratorially whispered:

You might want to back up to 13:3; had you learned that, you wouldn't
be in the pickle you're in now. 13:5 too, considering your blatant
falsehoods despite evidence presented against you. But, as I said....
perhaps you are a slow learner.

P.S. still waiting on those groups you claimed prefer topposting. We
could maybe give you the auction groups, but other than that, you've
been found wanting.
 
P.P.S. I wouldn't mind hearing your reasoning (and how it applies) for
posting:

"He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that
giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want." 

It's possible that you feel that you, poor in intelligence, are being
oppressed by everyone else, who (at least compared to you) are rich in
intelligence, and therefore we shall come to want?
