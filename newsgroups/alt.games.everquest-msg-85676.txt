  EQprices.com has always been pretty inaccurate as a pricing tool as far back
as I can remember.  However, I liked the site just because it was an easy way to
look for weapon/armor upgrades.  It has a better interface for that sort of
thing than any other site I know of, without having to pay for extra services.

  EQprices.com is down for me as well, unfortunately.
