I use pumices, they dont use mana, dont have recast delay, and leave a
spell slot free.

I didn't actually see the wiz recast manaskin the first time but noticed
it was on when my health started dropping rapidly and not going back up
again.

After he put it on again, I ran past my rooted pet and he followed a bit
out of casting range behind me, I pumiced the root off my pet so it
moved 1 metres and belted him. Was going to pumice at that point but I
saw a druid start casting, so I ran. Druid followed, and layed winged
death on me as I gated away (druids cant interupt). Easily pumiced when
I got back to my bind point.

Well even a 25dly weap is fast to me when the person has all those funky
haste effects.

For some reason low level snakes and spiders do that, havent noticed any
other mobs that agro only upon pvp being initiated though.

And I wouldn't be worried about them interupting you, at 50+ a hit for 1
or 2 by a snake shouldn't beat your channeling.

A lvl52 wiz friend of mine drops people quite often by doing this...

See person medding, cast tears of druzzil, cast lure of frost, loot
person. I only ever saw one person who stood under the tears, tried to
gate and actually got away (a high elf cleric in neriak). That tactic
just preys on people who are set on autopilot once PvP is initiated, ie
they auto-heal or auto-gate as soon as they take any damage.

This really only works on casters though, melee's generally don't try to
self-heal (except paladins and maybe rangers) and definetly don't try to
gate :p (not to mention their hp's at that level are ridiculous).

I see what you are saying. However you are looking at gear-wearing
people on rz having 120+ in the important resists (mr/fr/cr) self-buffed
at least. And for the small minority that wears real nice resist stuff,
150+mr and 200+cr/fr. I'm guessing most high level people are running
around in full sets of velious armour? Which generally have shit for
resists except for the bp's/robes. Generally on rz you'll find people
running around with all nodrop, which has virtually nothing for resists
when combined (sup level 58 wizard who looks like they just spawned for
the first time outside neriak because they havent got a nodropvelious
robe yet...), or they'll have everything based around resists. I never
max'd the int on my necro because imo resists take priority over int.

Anyway, thats only a small part of it. I'm more talking about skill
level, how prepped people are etc...I'm not quite sure how a level 54
enchanter would react if they got jumped RZ-style by a necro or a
wizard. Also another thing, high level caster vs caster pvp is usually
VERY fast, esp when involving wizards. Like <4 casts and the fight is
over by then usually. And if the person has little in the way of
resists, jump them with ice comet then follow with a jboot-casted
draught. And believe me that happens a lot, I saw another level 52
wizard pk I know waste a mage and an enchanter in 5 casts all up. They
were just naked shit-talkers, so he snuck up, Ic'd the mage, followed by
draught, dead mage...the chanter was trying to mez the wiz, but the wiz
was wearing gear. 3 draughts later enchanter dead too :p
