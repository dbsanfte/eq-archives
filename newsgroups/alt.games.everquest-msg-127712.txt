Bah, at best, this is borderline. I certainly can figure out where I am
given a map and a loc, thats what this program does. Maybe I wouldnt be able
to figure it out instantly, but close enough. It doesnt give you any more
information than what you can get from any spoiler site.

I use a third party program that enhances EQ for me as well. What happens
is, all of the music in EQ is turned way down, and the program plays other
stuff for me. Its all controlled with a program that was written with EQ in
mind. Dont tell Verant, I'll get banned.
