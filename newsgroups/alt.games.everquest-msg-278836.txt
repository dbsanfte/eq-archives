No clue what problems you might be talking about, but then, I stopped 
using nVidia before DoN.

I've heard a few people complain about an issue here, once in a long

Never seen a problem with it.

Having said all that, ever since one patch prior to DoN, EQ, and EQ only, 
crashes to desktop periodically.  EQ2 behaves just fine, other games 
behave fine, test software that serisously exercises the systsm, reports 
no issues with the system.
