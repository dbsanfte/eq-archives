I think the "younger" players you so fondly want to "educate" will 
figure this out pretty well by themselves. Most groups will set their 
own loot rules and not live by someone else's variations of what IS and 
ISN'T the right thing to do. Oh, BTW, this cleric is an authority on the 
"rules of loot" why? My comments below are directed to the so-called 
'group cleric'.

Hmm depends on what it is. Some Paladins might take offense.

> ac + str +saves = warrior items
> ac + str + int + saves =sk items
Most of the SK's I know couldn't care less about int, so why roll? Are 
you saying a +int robe is something they'd want to roll on? Hmm maybe 
with a caster alt?

> ac + str +wis + saves =paladin items

My rogue has all the agi & dex he really needs. But to each his own.

> now for the intelligence impared people
Are we to consider the author? Seems to me a little intelligence put 
into the writing here would save him/her some trouble. See below.

Duh!

Not sure, could you define a "plan ignorant"? How many months to pay? 
Although some warriors (read HEF, DE, low beginning strength chars) MAY 
want lighter weight also. Should they just destroy it if no monk is in 
the group?

Again, we think NOT before we speak. Evidently you've had a bit of bad 
luck. Most of the enchanters I know would NEVER try to tank past 20 or 
so. And aren't you inviting a bit of bad luck upon yourself doing 
something so stupid as to let him/her die? Hmm no clarity and no stuns 
when the mob is aggro'd on you for healing. Now THERE'S a lesson.

Can't comment on this because I have NO clue what you're talking about. 
First off, what zone. Maybe they aren't there for loot? Maybe they're 
there for experience? A cleric with an attitude such as this is IMHO a 
POOR cleric.

Duh! Or the smug musings of a pissed of cleric who didn't get his 
favorite toy in a roll? Methinks I've heard of several groups of 50ish's 
in Seb and they did fine. Maybe they had a competent cleric??

Well this is just too stupid to comment on. And proper spelling and 
punctuation, while not completely necessary, do tend to impart a SENSE 
of intelligence to the writer.
