Happened to me last night, but only in Iceclad and nowhere else, no
animations worked except for running, once I zoned out it was fine, zoned
back into Iceclad and there it was back again, seemed to be every player in
the zone appeared this way to me as well. Always been on good old 56k and
never had the problem before.
Weird.
