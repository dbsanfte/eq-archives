Thats true, I guess I'm talking more from the perspective of a pk (whos
aim is to kill the target), not non-pk (whos aim is usually just to
live).

Other pk's are usually the easiest to kill I've found, most don't wear
gear, and they tend not to gate at the first sign they could lose.

And yes, I wear resist gear at the expense of all over stats, my wizards
int is 161, but has 76pr, 109mr, 97dr, 126fr, 126cr...and I still havent
finished getting all the gear I need.

I don't rememeber it ever being dispelled, and the effect has the
disease icon. Worth testing sometime though.
