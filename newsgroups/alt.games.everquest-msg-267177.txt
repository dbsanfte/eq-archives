That's a pretty picture you paint, literally, but you failed to 
establish just what the copyright violation is. You can buy a book, 
mutililate it however you see fit and put it up on ebay with no fear you 
are violating anything.

The only reason you might get nailed for infrinment with your 'art 
work', is in regards to 'public broadcasting'. (which a piece of plywood 
with the pages glued on in order would effectively amount to).

You copied the story, characterisations, plot. Buying a book, reading it 
onto tape, and selling the tape is a simpler example of the same thing.

The derivative works stuff isn't really applicable to the IGE situation.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but misappropriation even as it applies to IP 
is not actually within the scope of copyright legislation. I'd be happy 
to agree that there is a framework for a case within the scope of 
misappropriation. But its separate.

I am pretty confident (wouldn't go so far as to say 'entrenched') that 
IGE couldn't be brought up on charges of copyright infringement. 
However, I would be happy to agree there is legitimacy to cases for 
fraud, misappropriation, and possibly others.

And "Some guy on usenet" is welcome to make a good case for copyright 
and I'll take it seriously, but DarkTygers's argument, at least, has 
reached an impasse. There is no point re-hashing old ground, but if you 
want to add something new... by all means...
