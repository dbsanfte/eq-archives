They upped resists in one particular zone, in order to stop people
from trivializing leveling through the use of AE. That does not mean
that they nerfed AE for the whole game, or that they even made it
unusable in that particular zone. All it means is they adjusted the
rules so that AE groups in that particular zone wouldn't be completely
trashing their model of exp gain.

The fact that AE groups WERE able to completely trash the "vision" of
exp gain, and as you said yourself "kill mobs in insane numbers",
should indicate that AE CAN be effective for exp groups. So effective
in fact, that verant alters the rules to tone it down.

Oh aren't you the clever one. Your wit is as piercing as an overcooked
noodle.
