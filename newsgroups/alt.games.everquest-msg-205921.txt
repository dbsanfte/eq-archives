I agree, although I may have phrased it differently. /grin

Dungeon crawling is a completely different kind of gaming to the 
OT/DL/PoP "pull, kill, pull, kill".
There must be an element of danger there to give it a little edge.
The most fun I have had dungeon crawling is without a chanter, 
root-parking or offtanking mobs as an alternative to mez. While it isnt 
as exp-efficient as having an enchanter there, it is a lot more 
unpredictable, and therefore (IMHO) a lot more fun. It also gives your 
druid or cleric something to do other than heal/dot.
