To be fair, I have only been in WW once, and was the only one in the
zone.  I have HEARD of rangers soloing WW, but that's hardly a lot to
go on.

That said, with animal based mobs, all you need is a short stretch,
and to be able to snare and fear them.  After that, it *SHOULD* be
cake.

I'll let you know once I hit 50ish.  :-)

I've heard monks talking about Velks as a nice solo spot.  Once again,
never spent any reasonable amount of time there.  Usually it's to busy
for my tastes.

I was just explaining my own personal biases here.  Not putting down
bards at all.  Although, I thought that bards were on a lower damage
table than Paladins and Shadow Knights.  Or am I a crack child?
