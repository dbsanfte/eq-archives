Ahoy all!

Been using v21 for awhile, and now that they have imposed their
restrictions on use during a 24hr period, I would love to hear from
fellow UK players what isp they are using.

As a modem user I would ideally like an isp without a 2hr cut off if
possible.

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. :)
