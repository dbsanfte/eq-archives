After reading and thoughtfully digesting the quintillion responses to my
"modest proposal," I now issue this retraction.

Do whatever you like.  Play or don't play.  People's lots in life tend to
settle where the economic and social forces cause them to settle, and it is
not my place or anyone else's to judge or give advice regarding how people
choose to spend their free time.  I would not change the system even if I
could.

I should not have said anything.  I myself can't stand bible-thumping
fanatics, and I must agree that my post did sound like it could have come
from one of these.

Anyway, you guys can't be all that busy playing Everquest if you have the
time to respond to my (albeit unintentionally) flame-inciting demagoguery.

Your friend,
Raul
