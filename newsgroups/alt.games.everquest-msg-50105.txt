Here's what I charge on Druzzil Ro
15-20pp for the old world
20-30pp for Kunark and Velious

I expect people who are higher than me levelwise to pay more. Yes, that is a
stupid stereotype, higher level = more cash to spend, but it seems fair to
me. Of course I accept more if people don't ask me the price and just give
it too me. I take stuff in trade as well. I also do one CR port a day, if
the opportunity presents itself. Its my little way of earning good Karma.

I use the "what ever your Heart moves you to pay" line when dealing with
people under 15. That only happens when I have time to kill. Usually they
will either say they can't afford what they think its worth, and I port them
for free. Or they say for free. They get nothing. I had one guy offer me the
shirt off his back for a port. It was a bronze breastplate. Needless to say
he got a free lift.

I just wish druids got Translocate too, that spell is so awesome for moving
people. ;-) Can't have everything I guess.
