I'm seeing this argument rage again, and I thought I'd try and split it 
off into a thread.

Gear you loot sucks, because it drops off a mob you can kill.

Since you end up killing hundreds of mobs in order to level, and 
repeating that for many many levels, if every mob you killed dropped 
something you could use, that would mean 100s of items rotting.

So say you have 30 places to put gear.  To upgrade every slot once per 
level, one in three mobs you kill should drop something you can use... 
IF you happen to come up with the right drops to cover every location. 
So we'd better triple that, oops, we're back up to every mob dropping 
something you could theoretically use.

Most people seem content to upgrade their gear about once every 10 
levels or so, as long as rather than all at once, its spaced out over 
time.  So you can cut the drops to a tenth what they were and still be 
ok.  BUT not every piece is good for every class or type or race or 
simply player preference.  Since some are good for multiple classes or 
races and so on, lets round off to just needing ten times as many drops 
in order to cover everyone.  Ooops, thats back to every mob drops something.

But now for every 150 drops you are using 1, the rest are rotting.

Unless we make it so you can trade the items with your friends. 
Suddenly the whole equation goes out the window, because we're back to 
ever drop you can either use or trade.

But wait, what if instead of trading it for another item, you use a 
currency instead; now you don't have to find a halfling paladin who 
needs a helmet upgrade -and- happens to have something you need; you can 
just sell it to the first haffer pally you see and then use the cash to 
buy what you want.  Same final effect but without the horse trading in 
between.

Hmm, but lets say someone 10 levels higher than you is also engaged in 
selling his stuff.  Well, you don't have anything to trade him, but if 
you sell 10 of your items, you can afford to buy one of his... which is 
a much bigger boost than anything you can loot yourself.

All your buddies are doing the same thing, so you can't sell your loot 
to them... but like the guy you are buying from, the guys 10 levels 
lower than yours want your gear.  So you sell it to them, and buy from him.

But now everything you loot is 10 levels lower than the items you can buy.

That is why the gear you loot sucks; its nice gear, but you are better 
off selling a bunch of it to buy something better than trying to trade 
it one for one for something you -could have- looted if you'd been lucky 
enough to match slot+race+class+desirable stats
