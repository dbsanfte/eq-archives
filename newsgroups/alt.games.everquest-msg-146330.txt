    How did the brute force, no-life, 'leet' wankers get there, do you
suppose? Was it by exploring new content when it's released, experimenting
with new strategies to overcome the new challenges, and being creative when
making these new strategies? Do you think they wait for a roleplaying guild
to publish spoilers to the tough mobs out there, then go and brute-force
them?

    There's one aspect of what you said that's true. No-lifers will be
rewarded more. You will get more out of EQ if you're unemployed and can plow
16 hours a day in, than you will if you have a job and commute and can put
maybe 4 hours per day in. I can't see how one would change that and not mess
the game up entirely, though.

    The usual reasoning is that what the powergamers whine about today, you
will encounter tomorrow if not fixed. Only unlike the powergamers, you won't
whine and try and get it changed because you're addicted to EQ. You'll just
leave.
