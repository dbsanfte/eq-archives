I prefer Axis (Axes??) & Allies.  I LOVED playing that game.  I used to 
stake out Australia, let everybody else win everything else, while I 
piled up EVERYTHING in Australia.  I may have lost, but it took a very 
very VERY long time for me to lose, while I cackled evilly.  Strangely 
enough, my friends don't play this game very often anymore :D
