doable and been done. See AC1.

The weapons/armour restrictions are a nice touch, but they really are 
only an extension of existing stat gear... I'm MT today on goes my HP/AC 
gear... I'm just doing DPS... drop in the proc gear and the big slow 
weapon, don't need the AC because I'm not going to get hit.

The problem is that classless systems become templatized. People 
discover optimal character construction and write guides: Do this from 
1-10, then multi-class this to 20-30, then multi-class this from 
30-45... etc and you will be the 'best'. Classless systems are more 
vulnerable to min-maxxing.

Templates are also worse than classes because they are external to the 
game (meaning new players don't know about them and 'gimp themselves'), 
harder to balance, and typically number less than the classes would have.

Oddly enough, despite all my negativity I prefer classless systems, but 
they are much much harder to design well.
