It should be alot better.  Let me give you a little advise.  As a warrior,
max out every melee skill you have at every level.  They are important.  As
a young warrior I neglected my taunt as well as my kick.  I used slam
instead, less damage but could stun. Well, low and behold when you get old
your kick stuns too with more damage. hehe.  Then you run across great
weapons you cant hardly use cause you never trained them.  2hb being prolly
the biggest offender.  Really how many 2hb items are really nice for a
warrior?  Not many, but when you come across that big awesome bashy and cant
use t very well it will make you sick.  Keep your skills trained every
level, you will be happy you did.
