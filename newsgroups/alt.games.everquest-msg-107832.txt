I don't have an 8500, but a 7200 (considerably slower card built on the same
tech) and it does well in everything using an Athlon 1.33. I think the big
key is to be sure you remove every trace of the ole NVidia drivers- there's
a program called NVCleaner that will do this (Not sure where to get it-
Google should locate it, though). Try that, and reinstall your drivers for
the 8500.

In reality, that Celeron should be your big bottleneck- it's nowhere near
capable of pushing that vid card.

Hope that helps a little
