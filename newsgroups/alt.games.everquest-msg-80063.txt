Well Biz, apparently the gods were smiling upon me. It seems I have my
account still, though still no actual word from the GM -- I logged in last
night and it had been 'cancelled, though I could resubscribe' -- then I
wrote a few messages to the GM and apparently he made everything go away. I
suppose he took it under consideration that I really WAS sorry (and not just
for being suspended/banned/whatever) for behaving in that fashion. Also, in
3 years, I've never had a /report sent against me. No red flags. Well, I
have one now, I suppose, but that's only just, considering my behavior.
Tonight when I logged in, the message was gone. And I then discovered that
it had been no mere player, but a *guide* I had yelled at. sigh. Gotta say
when I do it, I do it right.

Just wanted to let ya know.

thanks,
Darklet
