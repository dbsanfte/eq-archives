Our friend who started this thread is probably trolling.  It is either that
or he simply lacks eloquence.

As to essentially the same game play experience.  I wouldn't quite say that.
The same game-play model, most definately.  And why not?  It's a tried and
true model.  However, the actual experience is quite different.  Different
enough that many will find it more enjoyable and many will not.

I would highly recommend giving it a try to any EQ player.  In fact, if
MMORPGs are your hobby, and you have the means, I'd recommend subscribing to
both games actually.

Best Regards
