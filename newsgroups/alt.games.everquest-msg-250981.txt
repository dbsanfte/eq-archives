The fact that drugs are criminal -does- act as a deterrent to some 
people. Legalizing them endorses them, it will not merely decriminalize 
them, but will actually encourage people to try them.

Besides, there's an ethics dilemma there, not that governments are

always succeed, but at least its not going into situations looking to 
abuse them.
