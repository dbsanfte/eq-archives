Lots of BLs come to Dawnshroud in mid 30s.  or you can try Iceclad on
Velious.
I'm a 34 Ranger, I've been playing on Luclin for a while now,  hated LOIO so
I hunted around for a better place to go.  I've never even been to OT,
everyone keeps saying how great it is but.... I made 3 levels while my
friend was trying to make one and we were same level.  I was in Dawnshroud
and he was in OT.  We spent the same amount of time online (actually I think
he spent more time on) so I'll probably never go to OT.  He couldn't come
join me cuz his computer can't run Luclin.  Oh well, have fun
