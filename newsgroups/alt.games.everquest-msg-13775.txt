I think we are innately more murderous, actually.  Many US citizens
are descendended from people rejected by every other civilized country
on Earth, to be honest :)

That, and I think Japan has a very different culture.  Acting out just
"isn't done".  It seems to me that they tend to internalize their
stress, or concentrate on the group more than the individual as a
society (and I could be talking out my ass at this point, so feel free
to ignore me).  :)
