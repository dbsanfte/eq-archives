The reason I mentioned those two quests in particular was because
doing those (w/o high level help) made me realize that there might be
more to the game than I was giving it credit for. That was the point
where I canceled my EQ account (at least for now). 

>As to your question on which dungeons and quests are "better" and "more 
>interesting", well you know how tough a question that is.

Yeah. I know there won't be a definitive answer to that one but I'm
curious to know what route EQ2 took. I'd orginally planned to check
out EQ2 after Christmas but I'm still having too much fun in WoW to
bother. I'm sure I will at some point though.

The people I know that play both seem pretty evenly divided as to
which game has the better quest system. Strangely enough, even the
people that like EQ2 better concede that WoW is more 'fun'.

As a friend of mine put it; 'Any idiot can get to level 60 in WoW, and
many have'. If anyone needs proof of that statement, I point them to
the official WoW forums <g>.  

I guess that's true for any MMORPG but Blizzard does seem to have
taken it to the extreme. Well, if nothing else it should make for some
amusing pick-up groups if you approach them with the right frame of
mind (preferably while drunk <g>). I tend to group with friends I've
known since EQ but I might actually go out of my way to join some high
end pickup groups in WoW just for the entertainment value.
