Yeah, I guess I haven't been in Sebilis nor been to Skyfire.

Irony is before you even knew where the fuck Sebilis was or what the
pathing looked like in Skyfire, I was already hunting in both zones.
This was within the first days of Kunark.

But then, I guess I just pulled a level 60 character outta my ass eh?

On the third day of Kunark?  Killing wurms, drakes, chromadracs, etc..
since I didn't know better.

But then what's your excuse for being such a fuckwit?
