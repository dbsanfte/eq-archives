Yes, true.

All they care about is who will throw the bigger fit, the person complaining,
or the person with the questionable name, unless it is completely over the
edge.  (A "Drakon Mydixiewrecked" type name. (Yes, an actual last name I saw,
although I don't remember the exact first name) )

But as for thier 'We're going to go through the entire character database and
ban everyone with obscene names, and change questionable names every time we
see them'...  They were just blowing smoke.  None of that was ever done, and
nothing ever happens to a name these days without several people complaining.
