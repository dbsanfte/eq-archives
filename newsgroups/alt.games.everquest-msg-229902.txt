From the shadows, the mysterious "@ndrew"
<andrewratinternodedotondotnet> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>2.    The newsgroups I visit (list provided) are predominately top posters.
>These people are just ignored or accepted for what or who they are.

No matter how often you repeat this, it still remains untrue. And
since you continue to harp it, you will continue to be called a liar.

There has been one person who has checked who said they predominately
toppost. There has been at least half a dozen who say they don't. Why
are you being so stupid about this?

Topposting isn't considered the proper way to post in any newsgroup
that expects context in threads. It's only accepted in groups which
don't sweat netiquette at all.

It's over. You lost. Just give it up.
