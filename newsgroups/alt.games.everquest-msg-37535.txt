Ok .. my Iksar SHM got a full set of Mystic Scale armour .. now
after 35 I get the feeling only the helm is really nice and
will continue being on the shamans head .. but what about the
rest? AS weg get strong skill buffs, I guess AC is more important
than generic skills .. apart from +WIS items. What would you suggest
through level 35-40, 40+ 50+? The idea is to find something that
is more or less affordable/questable etc. Total hyper uber armour
currently makes not much sense to me, as this is my main and nowhere
near really rich. Suggestions?
