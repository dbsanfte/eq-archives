What a fun link--but imagine my surprise when I found out I was Yoda LOL

A venerated sage with vast power and knowledge, you gently guide forces
around you while serving as a champion of the light.

Judge me by my size, do you? And well you should not - for my ally is the
Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life greets it, makes it grow. Its energy
surrounds us, and binds us. Luminescent beings are we, not this crude
matter! You must feel the Force around you, everywhere.
