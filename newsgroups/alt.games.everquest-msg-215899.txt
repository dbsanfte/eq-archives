I was in an LDoN group as a druid and the cleric was supposed to be
main healer.  The cleric would let the tank and other mele's get down
to about 20% health then cast complete heal.  After the tank died 3
times because the cleric didn't get complete heal off in time or got
stunned, I started using greater heal to keep the tank at about 40%
health.  The cleric was furious with me saying I was wasting mana and
a lot of other crap that started pissing me off.  The tank faked an LD
and the group starting going downhill from there.  Anyway, was my
response of taking over healing appropriate? or was the cleric right?
This happens quite often and I would like to know what to do in this
situation.l
