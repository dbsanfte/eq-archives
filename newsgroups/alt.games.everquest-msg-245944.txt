Have a 49 Pally,SolRo too,he is right, its very hard to find a group
at this level,only zone you can find a pickup xp group at that level
is PoJ,and how many tanks are exactly needed there ?
Make a /w all # ,where # is a number from 1 to 64 and you will never
get the message "your request was cut short ...too many players".
99% of the players on SolRo  have level 65 chars.

Uland	 65 Hunter
Meldore	 49 Paladin
