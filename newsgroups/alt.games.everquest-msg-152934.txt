    My druid is 60th , and half of it was soloing. Quad kiting and root
doting are both simple and will net you experience per hour. What everyone
seems to miss is that a good group far exceeds this rate of experience gain
and always has.
    It is not that I can`t solo it is that soloing reduces your rate of
experience gain . I also do not find soloing very enjoyable(actually it is
boring to tears) which is why I am not very fond of my druid. Also what
soloing druids can do pales in comparison to the thrill of soloing with a
chanter where skill is involved . My druid could never solo a guardian wurm
in skyfire ( summons, hits for 540 , has a ridiculous reach, and 20k hps ),
but my chanter has.

A great number of chanters are hideous at the class. It is entirely possible
to just buff as a chanter every 30 mins and just afk for the experience to
roll in. This has led to a great number of people doing just that.
