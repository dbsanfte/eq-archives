Yah i think i have done it too, about 3 years ago.
But if you try it now, it will always be resisted due to a patch nerf. I
just dont understand why that got nerfed. It's prolly the only spellline
that makes wizards mana efficient and providing good DPS within groups.
Nuking single mobs just doesnt cut it in groups and is generally a waste of
mana imho.
