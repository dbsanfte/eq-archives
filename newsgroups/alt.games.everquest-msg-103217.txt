Curt Schilling, the Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher who was co-MVP of last
years world series was asked the following question:

Q: What's your favorite computer game?

A: Everquest.  I love it.  I play a lot more during the season because I'll
bring my laptop on the road and fire up the game whenever I have free time.
And I have a lot more free time during the season than during the
off-season, when I'm home with a wife and three kids.  Its not like I'm a
college kid again doing whatever I want, whenever I want.

The interview was published in The Arizona Republic, Tuesday, April 2, 2002.
