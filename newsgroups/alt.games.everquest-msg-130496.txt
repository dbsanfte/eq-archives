Yeah, they are nice looking, but do very little for the
overall sustained DPS.  I've also seen a crit of 24
from our group wizard - seriously embarrassing for him.

My original post was pretty specific - TOP CON WATER PET.  That
makes it a level 45, quad for 56, and backstabs for 170ish.  If 
you don't believe that a 54 water pet can OWN a like leveled
melee in anywhere close to level appropriate gear, you have zero
clue.  The margin wasn't even close - 33percent on low level
mobs (that were blue to both the warrior and my pet) and 50percent
for the 53 golem (yellow to the 52 cleric, blue to me at 54).  
Remember, the pet backstabs and has BOIII - vastly superior haste
to what that warrior had (if he had a haste item at all).  So,
anyone actually suprised that his DPS dropped of drastically on
a mob 8 or 9 levels higher than him?  (he started the session 44,
ended 45 can't remember which he was for that fight).

Actually, your original post implied they were  - quote

Innate crits have a very LOW chance of going off - and add somewhere
in the neighborhood of 3 percent to the sustained damage output of
a wizard (please note the word SUSTAINED - you don't read too well, so
I figured I would point that out for you.)

60 wiz huh, ever consider he might have SCF and SCF mastery?
Those 2 together give a 14percent chance of a crit.

My regular group is Me (55 mage - been camped in CoM forever,
finally got most of our guild's druids and rangers their JR's,
time to start leveling again) 54 wizard, 54 ranger, 57 ranger, 
56 druid, I've seen just how often innate crits go off, and 
I'm not too impressed.

If you seriously think innate crits are overpowered, hell even
powerful - then you are in dire need of a clue.
