Being agnostic in Everquest is kind of different from in the real
world. I guess you could say that the EQ gods are just really powerful
beings and that the clerics heal with pure magic instead of god
granted powers... You could also say that an agnostic knows there are
gods, but does not worship them - a notch up from admiring Hindu art.
The key is, if you want the gods to give you powers, you have to not
only know they are there, you have to worship them. My druid knows
Karana exists, but she can't use a Karana idol since she doesn't
worship him. She can't use imbued Tribunal jewelry since her mind is
not devoted to the work of the Tribunal. Agnostics can't use imbued
stuff because religious powers are a every real thing in EQ. You might
like the artistry, but you can't use it.

If anything isn't sell out in Norrath, it's religion. You pick a deity
and you're committed for life - no 'first one free' bonuses. You can't
pray to one god or another for a short while to get their powers, you
have to wholeheartedly and consistently follow them, and you have to
choose *one*.
