Speaking as a professional programmer, it's remarkably easy to end up
with spaghetti code if you don't take considerable care to clean it up
as you go. It's almost inevitable that you'll end up with some very
messy routines as you experiment to find the best solution to a
particular problem. It's essential once you've settled on a method to
make sure the code is tight, and that any related code is cleanly
modified to accommodate new changes.

I'm often appalled when I revisit code I wrote a year or two ago to
see just how badly done it was.
