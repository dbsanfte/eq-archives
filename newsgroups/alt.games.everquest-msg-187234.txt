I am one of those 'slow levelers' that get's mentioned here
occasionally.  I'm a casual player that spends time exploring,
tradeskilling, etc . .  quite a bit and doesn't really group or 'exp
grind' much at all.  Not even in a guild (gasp)  However, last night I
dinged 47 and I'm really curious about the planes.  I know I wouldn't
be able to go very far, but is it even worth it to try or should I
just wait awhile.  I have no clue how they even work.  My experience
is limited to wandering around POT one night thinking how very very
small I felt, lol.  Is there anything 'up' there that I could even try
to solo?
