I am a caster and I like my group to know what I'm up to. Plus I want to
train my sense heading asap:

"attack"
/doability 1 (sense heading)
Sending pet to %t
/pet attack

"backof"
/doability 1 (sense heading)
/pet back off

"high"
/Doability 1
Major BOOM on %t
/Cast 3

"medium"
/Doability 1
Medium BOOM on %t
/Cast 2

"rain"
/Doability 1
Major RAIN on %t
/Cast 1

"cancel"
/Doability 1
Casting CANCEL MAGIC on %t
/Cast 5

This one is amazingly effective, it kills any mob that's hitting me:
"ON ME"
/Doability 1
ON ME !

And in set nr2 I have the all time favourite:
"TRAIN"
/Doability 1
TRAIN to zone ! Move it or lose it !

The use of a single capitalized word gets the eye of the reader, even when
the reader is just skimming the text. Just make sure the main word is
visible and the rest is less so.
