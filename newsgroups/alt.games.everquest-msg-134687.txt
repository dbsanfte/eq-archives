Question, why do all classes have to have the same level of
"desiredness"?

Druids aren't desired as much in groups because their perceived
limitations?  So what, because they have the ability to be very good
soloers all the way from 1 to 60.

Shaman are good soloers, but not nearly as good at druids.  But they
are better buffers, and they have that all important slow line of
spells, so they are more desired.

Clerics suck ass as soloers, but they are the god class when it comes
to healing.  This means that they are very desired for groups, and
good for them.

Seems pretty well balanced to me.
