They'd need another client, for one thing, so there are technical reasons
why I don't think it's viable for them.  Also, there are always bugs in the
game, I don't think there's an 'instance' of the game code anywhere that
isn't bugged, so they'd basically need to be working on two versions of the
game in terms of bug fixes (and two versions of the client), unless
everyone was able to find a bugged version of the game that wasn't too
annoying.

I think we're clear I wouldn't.
