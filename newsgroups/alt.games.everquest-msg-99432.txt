Root breaks too often and is resisted way too much to be of use much.
Plus the agro generated from the root is hard to overcome once it breaks.
Plus a lot of mobs on luclin are immune to root and snare now.

The Deep. We were in tight quarters in a hallway, not much room to
root park anything.

We all fought to the bitter end. It was just overwhelming of the numbers,
3 or more mobs would get on 1 person and they would go down quickly
then all of those mobs would go to the next person and cut them down.
It was like a lawnmower cutting thru grass. Once the chanters ran out
of mana the clerics soon followed because the extras would agro on
the clerics once a heal was cast. I was attacking and assisting
the MA the whole time and we killed one after the chanters went oom.

Maybe not but trying to get a raid together without an enchanter or a cleric
usually results in a bust.

You would think that say sending in 30 warriors would be able to storm a
castle right? Sending in just 30 warriors into ANY high level area in EQ
is just as futile as throwing 30 corpses at the walls.

Heh true.
