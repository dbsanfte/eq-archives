I know from 2 personal friends camping it, and my pitching in with clearing
fear, and through at least another 2 guildies, that thats not true.

Anything over 3 days.. well 7 days falls into that category, but I'd hardly
call it "due to pop".. that wouldn't even be half way through the camp.

And of course if Cazic should happen to spawn through your camp, he will
re-pop the whole zone (minus the shissar)
