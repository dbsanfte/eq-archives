Aye, I have learned about the interruption effect of movement. I believe
I've discovered my problem:  my wife has too many hp and my little heal
spell barely registers on her bar on occasion when I am chain casting it on
her. I will live with this occasional problem and suffer her insufferable
amount of hp!

Ahh, makes sense. So my spell training will be a good predicate for my
Alchemist abilities later. I hear mixed reports of the profitability of this
enterprise, but given the nature of the Firiona Vie community, where there
is only one life to live, the economics are somewhat unusual and may indeed
support the profession despite contrary reports from other communities. In
any case, it is part of my Shaman culture and I must at least pursue the
research if not make it my life's profession.

Hammer my toes and call me a Halfling! I'm deliriously happy to hear of your
optimism. We are poor Barbarians today and I look forward to putting my wife
into some nice plate someday!

Thanks for your insights, I hope to see you on the battlefield!
