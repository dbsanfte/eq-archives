Sounds to me like you got lucky when you first got into the guild, and now
you're going through a dry patch to make up for it. I'm not trying to say
that it's anything to do with the timing compared to joining the guild, just
that when people are distributing loot, they try to spread it evenly to be
fair, otherwise you might just as well use /random! The problem is doubled
by the fact you're now used to getting more drops than average (from the
lucky patch, plus the self smithing advancement), and receiving less than
average (short term).

It sounds like you're putting in a lot of hours, and hours wise you might
well be due some more, but that can be difficult to calculate when you're
making decisions about who gets what.

You're going to have to sort this out in your head - if you don't, you might
find it messing up your relationship with your friends in the guild (even if
you're not saying anything to them, the fact that they've got the uber
shoulders of broadness that you could have got will be in the back of your
mind!) I can't help you much there, but maybe since progression (i.e. loot)
turns out to be important, you could look at this as extending the life of
the game for you as otherwise you'll have no advancement left to do (ok,
that's a bit lame, but is the best I can think of!) Maybe you should take
some nights off using an anonymous alt so you can enjoy the lower levels
'fast' advancement.

As an aside, at least now with dyes you don't have to keep the pink look on
the bits of Heraldic slots!
