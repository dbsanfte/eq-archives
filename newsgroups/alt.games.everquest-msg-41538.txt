Nothing wrong with the city, its the ground that kill you, you have to be mad at
GFay instead ;-)

Only bad thing about it is that it can be hard to find your way around it. I
certantly wouldnt do tradeskills there due to the vendors being spread to much,
but apart from that i think its one of the coolest cities in the game. You just
have to learn to navigate properly so you dont fall down, there are other fall
possabilities other places that are a LOT worse (being a troll newbie in Guk for
example, almost at the entrance you have to cross those small bridges, if you
fall down your dead since youll never be able to beat you way out again)
