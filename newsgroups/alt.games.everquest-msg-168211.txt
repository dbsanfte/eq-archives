Well

Here is the log of my Gnome Rogue and Gnome Enchanter.

Enchanters needed 1 motor while Rogues need 3 (you can have 2 bracers as 
they aren't lore)

My rogue has killed 52 humanoid rogue  & runaway clockworks and got 1 
motor and 6 gearboxes so far. As a result he is now KOS with the 
clockworks.

My enchanter killed 37 to get 1 motor and 9 gearboxes.

I've never got a motor or gearbox off a spider clockwork.

In the end my rogue's dropped off a runaway on route to the windmills 
from Ak' Anon.

While my enchanter got his at the druid ring valley.

While hunting someone shouted "I finally got a *&%$ï¿½ motor"
He was in the Minotaur Valley.

So Overall to summarise

1) As far as I can tell most Gnome newbie armour needs at least one.

2) They are ultra rare.

3) As far as I can tell they are random.

Result Keep on hunting.
