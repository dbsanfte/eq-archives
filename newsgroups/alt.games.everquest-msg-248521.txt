Most of the major differences between the two won't be in gameplay.
You'll get a fresh game engine built from the ground up with most of
the caps and other legacy bullshit from EQ removed. Then you have
cosmetic shit.. great graphics.. npcs's that talk, etc. But the core
shit that makes up EQ will be almost certainly carried over to EQ2 and
something he can learn in EQ while he waits for 2 to come out.
Grouping tactics, raiding tactics.. class abilities.. gearing
characters.. etc. All the stuff we learned as newbs and now take for
granted. Sure.. there will be new stuff mixed up in all that but
nothing that isn't additive to what is allready known.

Or do we just believe now that everybody knows such exciting tidbits
like the classes that can slow as a spell are shaman, enchanter, bard,
and beastlord? Or the mechanics of mezz.. how to work in a group with
one and without, etc. What seems trivial to us now as a knowledge base
took a while to build up. And if he's going to get going in an
mmorpg.. EQ is probably the best one he can start with and can take
him anywhere he wants to go knowledge wise over a short period of
time.
