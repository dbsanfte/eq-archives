	It is done on accident sometimes, I think tho.  I've
mistakenly hit the wrong key and inspected someone when I didn't mean
to (like when I'm trying to make a trade w/ them...I'm so used to
right-clicking w/ the merchants that I forget it's different w/
players).  I usually say "Oops, sorry, didn't mean to do that," and
they laugh and say "No problem."
