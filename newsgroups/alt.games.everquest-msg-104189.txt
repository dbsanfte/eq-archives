I've had to maintain 15+ year old, assembly language spaghetti code.  The
software had gone through a number of programmers over that time, each with
his own unique style.  The comments, where they existed, were out of date,
homegrown macro use was high.  You just have to sort of learn to intuitively
know where to look to fix problems, and pray you don't break 3 unrelated
things in the process.
