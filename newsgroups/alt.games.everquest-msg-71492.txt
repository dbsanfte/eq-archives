I would stay that Legolas was the only ranger, and that Aragorn and Boromir were
both warriors, but other than that...

A few additions of my own (yes, I'm a tradeskiller. Does it show?)

*****
Many hobbits (after reading Party invitation): Dwarf fireworks? Since when do
dwarves get tinkering?
*****
Frodo: I'll take the Ring to Rivervale... I mean Riverdale... er, Riven... umm...
Elrond's house.
*****
Bilbo (holding up the mail shirt for Frodo): They don't make vests like this any
more; it was too powerful so the drop was replaced with a roll of pink aluminum
foil.
*****
Gimli (in Moria): This was the source of mithril, used for making dwarf cultural.
But after they changed the mob spawn, it stopped dropping.
*****
Aragorn (to Galadriel) You are freaking wood elves! You mean to say you don't have
anyone who can teleport us anywhere even *near* Minas Tirith?!
*****
Aragorn (as they are getting in to the boats from Lorien): Careful. You know how
much of a pain these are to steer.
*****
Sam (after leaving Lorien): This elf bread's pretty good. Not proper hobbit food,
mind you, but at least it's a banquet, and with +2 STA, too!
*****
Sam (upon seeing Shelob): Wow! I could make a full set of raw silk off of her
drops, I bet!
Alt: Crag spider. *YAWN*
