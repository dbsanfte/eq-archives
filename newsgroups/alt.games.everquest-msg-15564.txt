PvP MMOGs have a place.  I'm not about to say they don't.  But THE future?
Nah.   And until a gaming company sees that there's a hell of a lot of
people who don't like PvP (regardless of how well it's done), like VERANT
did, there won't be any serious danger of EQ of even coming close to dying.
We'll see a dip, no doubt, but it wouldn't surprise me at all to see the
numbers going back up a month or two later.

There are no EQ-like (PvE, PvP not supported perpetual world) MMOGs coming
out.  I honestly can't see me getting into one of the new games
because -weird of me, I guess - I'm not into being ganked by some 12 yr old
with his first erection when I'm trying to solve a problem, kill a critter
or do a quest.

I'm just waiting for some idiot to say that "THIS game (whichever) WILL HAVE
real roleplaying!"  That won't be possible without requiring a minimum age
of 30 and then somehow figuring out how to enforce the age thing...and
that's not about to make anyone money.
