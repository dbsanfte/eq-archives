Evade reduces aggro ONLY when there is something else to take the rogues
place on the aggro list.  If the rogue gets aggro while he/she is alone
he/she is toast.  Unlike most classes that have some kind of "get out of
death free card" the rogue has none.  (except at high levels from AA points)
All casting classes can gate out in a pinch (some as low as level 4), SK's
harmtouch, Paladins LoH, Rangers can root and run, Monks FD.

The rogue speed with hide/sneak is like being snared, it's very, very slow.
A SOW takes the speed up to about normal walk speed, so even with SOW,
hide/sneak is very slow travelling.  Also, MOBs that see thru invis can see
thru hide/sneak.

Overall, the class has some very severe limitations which more than balance
their ability to deal high amounts of damage in a group.  So they can do
more damage in a group, who does that benefit? Does the rogue get more exp
in the group because he deals more damage?  So how can that make him
overpowered?

Well, I have to say that's very good to hear and very encouraging.  I based
my statements on several posts on the Shamans Crucible  Forums. As an
upwardly mobile shaman I was wondering what my role was going to be based on
what I read. Not a lot of complaining there, shamans are pretty much
satisfied with their class, however the general consensus seemed to be that
shamans don't stack up as well on raids as they would like.  As powerful as
shamans are, I still don't think they are overpowered as the original poster
stated.  I think they are a well-balanced class.

What I was really getting at is that rating classes as
overpowered/underpowered has to be based on something other than just a
general sense of the class.  All classes have different areas in which they
might bee considered overpowered, and situations in which they might be
considered underpowered.
