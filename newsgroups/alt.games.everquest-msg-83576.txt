...because "Kleenex" is a clear referrence to something that is
blatantly out of context in a fantasy world, as are most easily
recognizeable trademarks. Thus, they damage the fantasy setting and
ruin the atmosphere for many players.

There's also nothing in trademark/copyright law that says someone
playing a game can't use the name as the name of their character. It
surely falls under "fair use". Any attempts at suing VI over a
character one of their subscribers plays being named "Kleenex" would
surely be thrown out as frivolous. VERANT isn't using the name for
profit, and isn't defaming the company.
