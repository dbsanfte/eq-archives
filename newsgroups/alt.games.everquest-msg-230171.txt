I turned in 10 EP's today to the BL guy - no 61 healing, 2 IoS,
3 Araq, 3 Scorpion venom and 2 SoV.  Humorously enough, the 2 IoS
came on the last 2 turnins.  I just can't see spending 1.5k on it
(the lowest price in the bazaar) much less 5k (the highest).  I
handed my 2nd copy to a guildie who was similarly disgusted with the
price, and refused to pay it. 

I'm looking forward to it because it takes up only one slot - and
I don't have to fob off melee who want me to STR buff them with
"I didn't buy that one."
