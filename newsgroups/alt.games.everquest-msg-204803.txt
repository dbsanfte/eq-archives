I've always maintained I have gimp gear - as you can see :)

Keep something in mind, I was part of a group that killed Taekwo Icequake
and I looted my staff, I looted my shoulders in a PoJ trial, my cap in
a PoN group, my Hive Fiend Brain in a UP xp group pre-pop (then a
replacement for it just recently as we were going through UP to kill
the nameds), looted my Efreeti Boots, those Loam pants, the cloak 
from a named snake in the grey.  All in groups when the mobs were dark 
blue experience givers.

I intend to loot a Bracelet of Insight (the 15int, 12ac, 6 all saves)
bracer that Taekwo/Radir/Zelnithak can drop.

For me, looting stuff I'll actually use is great fun.

Well, just for an example I was in a BoT "lower sands" group the other
day on my way to 65.  65 warrior, 65 monk, 65 (then 63) shaman, 63
cleric, 63 wizard, 64 mage (me).  We were fighting stuff with approx.
15-20k hp each.  I was using my water pet, and until the 3rd MT of the
day he was always on the mob's back.  While we had the 65 shaman, he
had Ferine Avatar on.  Parses at the Towers say this is 80-95 DPS for
the pet.  I have a burnt wood staff (in inventory there) I sacrifce 25int
(all above 200) and 100 mana to equip it - but it gives a 13.5 second,
333-399 (with bracer) free nuke.  I have a Drogmor, so I can med constantly
while nuking.  I was also using Firebolt of Tallon (which is barely my
most mana efficient spell until I get Black Steel) 2000-2400 damage in
~6 seconds for 450ish mana.  

When we were really in the groove we were chain pulling, and killing each
one in less than 1 minute.  With the 65 shaman, he was debuffing, so I
didn't have to.  I was passing mod rods out to the cleric and wizard as
well.

Each mob had my pet on it, and I would lead off with a staff nuke (aggro
reasons), 1 FoT, 3 more staff nukes.  The 3rd of those trailing staff nukes
sometimes didn't connect due to the mob dieing.  That's how I get <60
seconds for each mob (4*13.5 + 1*6) you can chain cast r-clickies without
a refresh.  When they all connected I nuked for 3750-3900 per mob and got
a minimum of 4500 dam per mob out of my pet.  

Since I was mounted (20mana per tick), had Xegony's Phantasmal Guard (6
mana per tick), 2 per tick from being 62 (3 now at 65) and KEI (14 per
tick) and ate a mod rod every 15minutes (net 5 per tick) I was making
back 470 mana every mob for the 450 I spent.  

I experienced a slow drain on mana, because I'd intersperse
staff nuke/fot/staff/fot/staff mix on some mobs, and I was passing out
the rods - but we'd have s short pause every 10 minutes or 15 minutes
for various reasons.

So, my minimum damage on most mobs was 8k in less than 60 seconds, 
or a minimum of 133 dps.  More like 9-9.5k on the vast majority of
mobs (150+dps) and topping 175dps on a decent percentatge of them.

As for FT - 1 more mana per tick on top of 47 just isn't a very big
percentage boost  The reason I haven't gotten a solstice earring 
yet is because I need the cash for Black Steel, cheapest I've
seen it yet is 15k, and I had 13.5 on me. 

For mana pool, I maintain 80% while in xp groups.  When the shit hits
the fan (adds with only root park as CC) and it's time to burn, I can't
empty my mana bar because I'll pull aggro first.

And for the HP, well, in PoP I play with every HP buff I can get and
usually have over 3k - enough to survive a couple of rounds.  However,
even that isn't enough when a hasted ex-charm pet from another mage
comes over and quads me for 500 a shot with 96percent haste :-P

> Just interested and confused, really really not trying to poke fun.

No offense taken, just remember how gear independent mages are.  I've
always been a huge DPS contributer in VERY sub-par gear.  For a non-
raiding mage mana pool isn't all it's cracked up to be, and I have my
crucial focuses (mana savings on nukes, damage boost) as summons.
