All of the stuff you collect mining you can use to skill up in
tradeskill.

Buy a stack of 20 of the cheapest liquid that is sold in the
tradeskill instance along with a stack of 20 candles. Make the Fossile
Tempers with a mineral, a liquid and a candle. Buy coal for the forge.
Use the coal, raw tin and the Fossile Temper that you just made to
make tin bars. It is a no fail to make pristen tin bars. Take them
with more Fossile Temper and more coal to make tin spikes, another no
fail operation.

I made it to 8th level from 3rd level in tradeskill on just what I
scrounged up while working on my mining skillups. Didn't cost me
anything after I sold the spikes to the vendor.

Works fast to get tradeskill experience.
