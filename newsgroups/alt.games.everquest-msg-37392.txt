    Not true. In the area above the guards is Azzar Habib of the Dreadful
Hat, and another SK NPC. That SK cons dubious to my Ally-to-Paineel
Paineel-born Necromancer. If you enter Paineel you'll find a few other NPCs
that aren't Heretics, like the human in leather with all the SK/Necro NPCs
when you first get off the elevator.
