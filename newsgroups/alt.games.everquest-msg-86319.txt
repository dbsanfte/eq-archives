That is not true. The benefit of cel heal is that you can cast it and then
med while cel heal negates damage taken in that time. There is a line that
you cross though.
I group with chanters and shaman alot so I usually have the mobs slowed and
that helps ALOT.

Basically if the mob is doing more that 150-200/round total, I'll wait and
CH, otherwise I can cel heal, sit down and the tanks HPs stay about the same
till cel heal wears off. I'm L56 and against most exp group mobs we don't
see em hitting this hard all the time. esp slowed.
