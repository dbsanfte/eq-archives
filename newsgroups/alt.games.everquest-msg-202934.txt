I have the same graphics card except it's a GeForce 2.  The best thing
to do to reduce the lag is to lower the clip-plane down to around 15%.
 When I am running around old world zones and any zone that does not
normally lag for me, my clip plane is at 35%.  In the Bazaar, which is
the worst for lag, I lower it to 10%.  You can do this under Options.
