I was very skeptical of this also.  However, I had an old account that
didn't have any valuable characters on there so I said, what the hell!

I do not know how the guy did it, but he did raise me 10 levels (I did not
want to tip off Verant too much) and gave me a few uber items and 10K plat.
He also raised my skills accordingly so I would not suck.  He did not give
me any new spells, but I can buy those.

Obviously, giving away your account name and password is risky, but it
worked for me, and I changed my password as soon as the guy was done.
Officially he does not charge anything, but he gave me an address to send
"donations."  I sent him a few bucks, since he saved me weeks of leveling.
