My theory is don't waste money on minor upgrades...

1hb - Enamelled Black Mace (8/28). Could probably pick one up for
100pp.
2hb - nothing really good. Go with lowesdt delay just to work skill.
Eventually pick up a Mithril Staff (28/45) or better. Price of MS has
dropped from over 1000pp to as low as 500pp.
1hs - hard to beat the value of Langeax (6/23) selling for 10-20pp.
The Crystal Fiber (8/26) is nice too for under 100pp.
2hs - you're not going to beat you Axe of the Iron Back. Save up for
an Executioner's Axe (25/50+haste) as low as 300pp.
pierce - Bloodstained Fang (9/32), Walrus Tooth (6/22 +3 str +6 sta)
are both nice and priced under 50pp. Chill Dagger (5/22 +10 cold
offhand only) is nice for building pierce and dual wield at the same
time. Priced under 25pp.

Don't forget about archery. Just buy the cheapest bow and arrows you
can find for now.
