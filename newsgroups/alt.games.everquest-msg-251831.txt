FWIW, I managed to log in via the UBIsoft login server instead, so you 
might want to try that if this happens in future (not like the login server 
goes down often, is it?).

You can download the UBIsoft patcher from 
ftp://ftp.ubisoft.com/eqloft/download/EverQuestUniversal.zip

(or its under community>downloads from the EQloft front page)

To be on the safe side I duped my whole EQ directory and overwrote the 
Everquest.exe in the new dir with the UBI one from this zip file. After 
some patching (I'm guessing this was just french/german localised stuff), I 
was able to log in, via a retro-look login interface, to *all* servers (not 
just the UBI run ones), whereas I couldn't via the SOE installation. It 
seemed quite happy with my SOE-not-UBIsoft-customer station account.
