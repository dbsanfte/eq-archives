According to official policy, nobody owns a camp. If you petition, a
GM or guide will show and enforce a comprimise (take turns on the
spawns or something of the sort). If one or both parties insist on
going against the comprimise, then warnings will be issues, possibly
leading to suspension.

Another option is to stay where you are and keep at it, ignoring the
other guy. If he nabs a mob after you engage it, then you petition his
ass for killstealing.
