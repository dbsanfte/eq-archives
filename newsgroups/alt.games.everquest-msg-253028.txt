Doesn't work. One, he is flagged uncharmable. 65 chanter with CoD got the
not able to charm message. Two, if you aggro him, run him all the way to the
end, and then wipe aggro(say a monk for instance), he'll walk/warp back to
wherever you aggro'd him. Have to do the whole walk, no way to work around
it.
