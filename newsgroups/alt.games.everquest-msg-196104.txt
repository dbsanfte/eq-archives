You forgot Mana Preservation focus items.  If the OP has PoP he
should try to get the pieces for the Fine Antique Ring quest:
High Quality Cougarskin (should be able to find for 5 or 10pp
in bazaar if patient), Cockatrice Beak (drop into OT right at
PoK book, if anybody is hunting there might could get one as
cheap as 2pp or so), Undead Frogluk Tongue (from LGuk, should
be able to find cheap on vendor or in bazaar, again don't pay
more than 1 or 2pp), and Tiny Rockhopper Eye (drops off newbie
mobs outside Shar Vahl, just head into Shar Vahl and check
vendors, get one for under 1gp).  Details of the quest hand-in
can be found on Allakhazam, gives a very nice lowbie caster or
hybrid ring (3ac 30hp 20mana Mana Preservation II, IIRC).

Also, Wizard has Invis by L13, correct?  Get a Sarnak Blood
and look up Fine Cut, Inlaid Diamond Mask quest.
