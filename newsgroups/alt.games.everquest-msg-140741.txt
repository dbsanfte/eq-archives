PS2 will most likely be my DVD player of choice when I can afford one, 
as well :) With maybe some kind of player on my computer as back-up, 
'just in case'.  I already own a couple DVDs - because my sister owns 
the PS2 I mentioned and brings it home from time to time, and I'm an 
'extras' junkie (even if they are crap, I wanna see anyway :)), and 
because when I rent movies, I tend to forget to bring them back - with 
DVDs, that is a VERY expensive bad habit.  It's literally cheaper for me 
to own them.
