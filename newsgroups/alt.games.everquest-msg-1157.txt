You said it.

Everything works both ways and there's absolutely no point in posting a
diatribe like this when it only serves to make you look like a hypocrite.
You and biz can have pissing contests until you're both soaked for all I
care, however the fact is that a) you obviously don't have as much Usenet
experience as you think. If you did, you would know that posting a long rant
like this only serves to open you up to more attacks and also never, ever
works.. And b) this post is a troll, which you obviously had no intention of
it being, however, it is.

Why post it? Why not just follow your own rules, KF the people you hate and
stick to lurking? I hadn't KF'd you up until now because I thought you'd
stopped, I usually let someone flame me more than once just in case they
redeem themselves.

However, I shall follow both your (and my rules) by making good on that
promise.

>and only regret that I must see your drivel in here

Yup and I'm sure the feeling is mutual.. not only from me, but from all the
lurkers who don't want to wade through the remains of arguments you (and
others) keep starting with eachother.
