Now see, I've killed six spiders in EK.  And I've gotten two silk off 
one spider.  That's *it*.  Here's what I did:  wait until you hit level 
29, 30.  Then wander around through Oasis/SRo, occasionally (I won't 
mention how many times I typed that word out) shouting out that you're 
buying silks for 2pp per silk.  At level 30 you can hunt giants in FM or 
join a group in HHK and make that money easily, and while you're hunting 
the spiders, solo derv camps (NOBODY camps the dervs in Oasis) and sell 
the bronze weapons.  It's a) fun running around getting revenge on stuff 
that tormented you when you were younger and b) fairly easy to get 
silks.  Plus, I've often run across people camping the AC in SRo letting 
all their kills rot.  If you see bodies lying everywhere, just ask 
politely if you can loot, get the permission, and you've got a little 
extra money coming in off madmen/mummies (as well as the occasional 
gem/shield to sell), as well as fairly constant silk drops.  Plus 
they'll be happy to see you helping them kill everything in sight *g*.  
I'm lucky in that as a rogue, I also use the time to farm poison 
components off of quite a few things in the desert, of course.  But I 
still think it's a heck of a lot more fun than sitting in an empty zone 
bored out of your skull.
