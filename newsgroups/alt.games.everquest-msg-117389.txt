Whenever we have two or more Paladins in the same group (which
I see a lot because I play a Paladin myself, so all my groups
have at least one to start with), I always make sure we have
an agreed upon "LoH rotation".  That is, Paladin#1 is going to
be responsible for using his LoH if anyone needs one, then
after he has burnt his up Paladin#2 steps up to the plate
to be ready to fire his next time one is needed, etc.

Otherwise, as you say, you may end up wasting two or more
LoHs on the same target.
