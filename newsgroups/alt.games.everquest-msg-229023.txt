Although Id have thought they could have got more GMs on I grant you,
as they can monitor petition queues from outside EQ, they can see when
theres been some there more than say 30 minutes and go look at them,
why cant they introduce a method - after all they develop it, to
answer ALL petitions from outside eq, therefore your petition gets
answered in order, from ALL servers, and can be done by 2 people or so
.. without issue.
