wow i think your post might have made me think twice about daoc.... maybe
this little loving and kind-natured act mythic has done is enough to make me
want to come back to daoc.... doh nevermind, it was just gas.  point is daoc
high level game has zilch for me to do that is fun whereas i've been at eq
for over 1.5 years and still haven't explored all the zones or taken down
all of the uber mobs. all you pansy ass little girlscouts need to stop with
this "verant is soooooo mean to me and mythic treats me sooooo much better.
heck, mythic even gives me a reach around!" crap and man-up.
