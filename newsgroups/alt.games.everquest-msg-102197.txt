Yes the quest is do able.
1.  The pillars run across the zone from NW to SE if you don't see the NPC
there to start the quest more then likely your in the wrong area there is
hill that divides the pillars so you need to know where your at.
2.  You need to collect four of the knifes that the explores drop, exp off
of and explorer is decent.  If your a Iksar it may hold back your faction a
bit in FV, but killing gobbies on a frequent basis should fix any lost
faction in FV
3.  The tower is located at pos 1800 pos 150 in LOIO.  If your on your own
use a ranged weapon to draw one explore at a time.  Knifes on Explorers
ranged about one for every four kills.  It takes a bit but I got all four in
about an hour.  At 25 the explorers should con a dark blue, and the lead
Explorer should con yellow.
4.  After turning in the knifes you gain faction with a few of the people in
Cab and lose a little in FV if I remember correctly.
5.  All you get from the quest is faction.

Hope this has helped you out.
