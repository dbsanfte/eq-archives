Which explains any confusion we had over my original point;  my book
differed.  And now that I've explained the difference, and you've
justified your error, can we move on to discussing the point again?

Or would you rather argue about the irrelevant consequences of parsing
my statement through your book?

The name of the person in question.
You *do* know google isn't just a websearch tool, and that it archives
usenet as well?

>Why would I search? 

To make an informed decision about whether or not the request had
merit.  Like, fucking DUH.

And if that's too much effort, just ignore the whole thing.  That's
fine too.

I quote:
"I'm just saying that I don't like blacklists, and will balk, though
not in anger, when I am asked to join one."

Tell me how that doesn't say "I'll not join a blacklist, even if it is
the right approach."
