Sure you can...lev, sow up...tash or debuff him (don't damage
him, or he'll summon), then run run run run out over the ocean.

Hope root sticks long enough for you to either:
(a) camp out (haha...good luck)
(b) atone him down (haha...good luck)
(c) mem blur him (I don't even think this works)

Best thing to do if you REALLY want to move him is get him FAR
away, root him, and let him kill you as he's rooted...

When many (read: almost all) mobs are rooted and then have an
empty hate list (from tactics above), generally they won't move until
something else aggros them.

I always wanted to see the IM take on the FV boat...

Not the PCs ON the boat...the boat itself...
