I just got back into playing EQ after 3 months out of town...

My halfling druid dinged 26 whacking Mammoths in EF and I'm looking for
advice on where to go for a breath of fresh air as well as some good exp
to get me through my 20's.

I've tried LOIO and while the exp. is good there, I was hoping that
something in Luclin (which I have, but have only explored briefly) might
be more entertaining. I've heard Stonebrunt can be lucrative in both
exp. and gold as well. I play sporadically, which makes soloing a preference.

Suggestions and advice on hunting grounds appreciated.
