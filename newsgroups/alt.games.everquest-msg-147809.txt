If the spiders are back in Nurga, then, the two spider spawns there are
great at level 54.  Might be a little slow spawn rate for a necro though, me
being a mere shaman, it was perfect.  There are two spawns of two spiders
each.  It is possible to single pull them by grabbing the correct one.  If
both come, well, root and rot both of them.  I seem to recall a mention of
the spiders being MIA though.  The xp was very nice for me at 54.
