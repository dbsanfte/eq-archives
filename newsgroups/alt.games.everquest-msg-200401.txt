Sorry, but I have to disagree here. Neither ports nor breeze/clarity 
*ever* generated even *half* the degree of silliness that KEI has. It is 
out of hand.

I feel it's pretty darned safe to say that the current KEI madness is 
hardly what they were shooting for there.

I'm all for giving the people what they want, but if we could all govern 
ourselves, there wouldn't be any need for government. Just because a 
vocal group cries out for something doesn't mean it's a good idea. 
Besides, the KEI situation is something I feel was an accident that they 
don't want to risk dissolutioning many by fixing.

Say what you want, but I've been more a fan of the "Vision" than not. Not 
that many of the recent changes haven't been for the good, but I think 
the "Vision" had the right core of ideas.
