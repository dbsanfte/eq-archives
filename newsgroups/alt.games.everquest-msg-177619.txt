>How are the graphics ?? I have an AMD XP1800 with a GF 4 TI 4600 and 792 
>RAM, will it look good  or great ??

That's the same Processor, Card, and memory I have, and it's smooth as can 
be at 1024x768.  I just put the GF 4 in last night to replace the GF 3, and 
noticed not difference.

>Sadly I'm used to Morrowind graphics, but I won;t expect that ;-)
>Ehrmmmm, no more questions furthermore, anything I'm missing ??

I hated the Morrowind graphics.  I'm not into thae dark look and thought 
the race models were... too odd.  I didn't give the game a chance because 
of this.  Maybe I'll go back someday...
