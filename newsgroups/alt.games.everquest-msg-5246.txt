 I'd classify them a pet class if they've had pets from the early spell
levels and beyond. Where pets are basically integrated into the class
strategy. The fact that Druids get a pet at 55 doesn't classify them as
a pet class in my opinion.

 I would consider Shadow Knights a pet class even though their pet isn't
that strong. I'm guessing some would only consider necro and mage as pet
classes because their pet can tank but I think that's a little too
narrow.
