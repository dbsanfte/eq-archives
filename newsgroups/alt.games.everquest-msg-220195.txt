I agree. I woudn't have made it to 65 if it wasn't for PoP. *AND* before 
you point out the obvious, I wouldn't have made it to 60 either, in all 
likelihood.

On the other hand, I'm finding LDON a bit of a waste of money. If I 
apologize profusely and find a replacement, I can get out of a PoP group 
whenever I feel like it. Hell, in a pinch, I can always pretend 
linkdeath if we're not in the middle of a pull, and know that I'm doing 
the group no harm other than a little inconvenience. In LDON, you can 
have a 90-minute adventure, but the total commitment required is a bit 
of a drag for those with commitments or a short attention span.
