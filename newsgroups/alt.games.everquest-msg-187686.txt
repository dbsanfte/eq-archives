IMO, except in areas where returning would require a long, dangerous
voyage or a CR is simply impossible without outside assistance, rezzes
ARE a favor, groupmate or not. The only other exception would be when
the group is hunting for an item specificly for you.

No, I don't play a cleric myself.

And, once again, the rest of the group was in no way hurt by the
asshole's lost xp.
