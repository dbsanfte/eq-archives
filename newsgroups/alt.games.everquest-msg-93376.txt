I can't help you much, but there are a few threads from the beastlord
site. See http://pub78.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm2.showMessage?topicID=83.topic
 and http://pub78.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm1.showMessage?topicID=348.topic
for some info.

On a related subject, can anyone tell me the difference between the
following:

/pet sit  and /pet guard here
/pet follow and /pet guard me

and how can I make wolfie leave a fight? If I keep hitting /pet back
off, as soon as the mob hits me or the pet, he flies back in to the
melee.

Many thanks,
Goldbear
Antonius Bayle
