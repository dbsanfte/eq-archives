Or so they say. There were other statements regarding xp that came from
VI that weren't correct to say the least.
My guess would be that if VI representatives say they are going to
improve xp in groups they most likely mean that the relationship between
grouping and soloing will improve in favour of the former. This will be
accomplished by reducing xp soloing used to produce :)

I disagree. That depends on the group. I find that when I solo (waiting
for people to arrive). When my regular partner arrives I pull 4 times
(four times) as much. When we have full group I just keep pulling -
deliver mob or 2 or 3 and as soon as they off me I'm off to bring more
and bring next mob in time to get xp from the previous one delivered.
I pull 10 mobs in the place of 1 I would solo at the same time without
any problems.

Prolly won't be an enhancement as such, but I really don't mind. I
hardly ever solo. I find it boring, and down time is considerable. When
we have group of 6 nobody ever seems to run out of mana. When solo I
loose at least 60m and that's with no resists, otherwise I don't out
damage the pet and get xp cut in half :/

Then again I only group with people I have grouped previously, or with
people that come recommended by someone in the group already.
/ooc's LFG's and 'May I join please' doesn't get anyone into my group. I
made that mistake (grouping with strangers) enough times already,
thankyouverymuch.
