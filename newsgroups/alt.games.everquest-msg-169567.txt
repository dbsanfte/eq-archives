Only one problem with this:  I have one page of hotkeys solely used to
handle my pet... when I'm on that page, if I have my forward key as a
shortcut for hotkey #10 (Sense Heading), I'll tell my pet to "get lost"
every time I hit the forward key.  If I put Sense Heading on any other
hotkeys I'll be telling my pet to do some other thing that I may not want
him to do... although I suppose I could map it to "/pet follow me" since he
tends to get bored and wander off at random when I'm running around and then
bring back 20 mobs for me to fight off (all out of pure love for me and in
consideration of how much I love fighting, of course).
