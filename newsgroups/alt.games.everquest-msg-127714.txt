One of my best EQ memories was taking my newbie level 2 Ranger and trying to
get to Freeport from Qeynos, to meet a RL friend.  The RL friend, who was
around level 8, made a Ranger to show me the ropes, and then we undertook
the trip, using tracking to spot danger.  All we knew of the route was what
we could figure out from the map that was in the EQ box.

The sight of the wooden bridge in NK was amazing.  I eventually made it to
Highpass, and got killed there.

There's a lot of magic in the first few levels for a true newbie, which
should not be taken away by PLing them.

Yup.  However, a little twinking is OK, I think.  E.g., giving the newbie a
single 8 slot bag helps a *lot*.
