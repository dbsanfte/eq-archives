Untrue for me, I also run XP and an SB Live Player 5.1. It does more than it
did before (i.e. I get some hall in caves and some music plays), but the sound
is still stuttering like hell and only recover if I move (turn doesn't work)
or it goes silent or stuttering. The sound efefcts are WAY to different in
dynamics .. rain is like VERY loud and footsteps are hard to hear and so on.
And that is with all XP optional patches installed, with the newest (only)
5.1 drivers from creative and an up to date Everquest.
