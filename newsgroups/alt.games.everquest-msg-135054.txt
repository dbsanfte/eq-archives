I left my bank mule parked there last night, made 400pp unloading crap
that's been clogging up my bank slots.

Absolutely.  On Povar, the auction zone is GFay.  It was dead silent - all
the traders were in the Bazaar.

I'm thinking prices will start dropping.  If it's just you hitting GFay/EC
every couple of days, you don't have much competition.  But when there are 6
other people selling the Shiny Thingy of Doom, you'll probably start
lowering the price a bit.

I like it.  I kept resisting the temptation to bring my main up there and
score some stuff for my twinks.
