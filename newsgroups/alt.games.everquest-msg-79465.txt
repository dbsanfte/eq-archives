Actually, since he was up, you would want to wait (to be proper, although
this waiting WOULD give time for you to be KSed) only a few moments (as in
seconds not minutes) to see if anyone was camping him.  I say this based on
a situational point of view.. meaning if a person was camping him they might
have been up on the "look out" or near the rogue leader to see where the
"red" rogue is/was, knowing Dyllin was "up."  Though, technically, if no one
is around to kill the sumbitch, it's all yours.  Just remember to excercise
the advice given by me concerning this particular NPC with others you may
encounter that are similar situations.  (ie. have a certain pathed "red" mob
that will agro, pacing back and forth, or whatever)
