I see plenty of things in there.  If my guild continues on the path it
is currently on, LDoN may become my favored way of upgrading my gear.

Primary hand IDIV.
FT2 and FT1 that go in Slot type 7
FT2 and FT1 that go in Slot type 3
Spell haste in Slot type 3
DPoC (both char's)
Excellent ratio H2H
36% haste aug (my current haste item is 31)
>Ornate armor (for BL)

Heck, all that will keep me going for quite some time.
