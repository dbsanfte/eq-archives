And, pray tell, how's Sony stopping you from roleplaying that? Last time 
I checked, they hadn't introduced any code to automatically join you to

Your post reminds me a lot of some guy a few years ago who posted that 
Sony ought to entirely remove the xp penalty on death so he could 
"roleplay a bold character who takes risks".
