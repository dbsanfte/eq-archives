Actually, once nuking time starts, Wizards quad pretty fast.  I'm using
Pillar of Lightning.  4 nukes drops a pack of Wyverns.  4.5 second casting
time, 6 second recast, so that's 27 seconds, plus a little for running.
Call it 35 seconds.

A single takes 5 casts of Voltaic Draught, which is 3 second cast time, no
recast time, so there is just whatever the normal gem refresh time is (2.5)?
That would be 19 seconds.  Since there is one more cast, there is one more
"run a little, and wait for them to get back in range", so I'll add 2 more
seconds than I added for the quadding case.  That makes it 29 seconds, vs.
35.

Wizards are *fast*, once we get things set up so we are actually nuking. :-)

Well, most kiting Wizards have jboots or tboots.  Since we tend to pull with
Staff of Temperate Flux, rather than a snare, we tend to not even start
considering multikiting until we get boots.

I do occasionally pull with stuns.  E.g., the Wyverns around the zone out to
SS in CS.  I'll mem two stuns, use those to stun two of them, and before
those wear off, target one as far away from me as possible, and hit Staff of
Temperate Flux on it, and back out the window (with lev on (except
once...oops!)), trying to target a fourth to use SoTF on.

I think it is there to annoy Wizards. :-)  It uses less mana than Atol's,
and reduces mob speed by 5% more.  Sure, the duration is less...but as you
see from my numbers above, it is long enough for Wizard use.  It would
actually be used in some cases by Wizards if we got it.  Instead, it goes to
Druids, who have almost no use for it.

Note that the Druid AE snare also removes any SoW or other movement buff on
the mob, so that when it does wear off, the mob is not fast.  I don't think
Wizard snares do this (they don't mention it at Caster's Realm, anyway).  I
think that if I want to remove a mob's SoW, I've got to break out the cancel
magic line.  If I snare first, then CM, don't I risk removing my own snare?
If I CM first, and it fails to remove the SoW, I've got a very pissed off
mob, coming at me faster than my jboots can take me away.
