I have one of each spread amongst three characters.  It does have to be
equipped in your primary slot, so I only use it when I am worried about
successes rather than skillups.  It does help, your success rate is somewhat
higher.  Still looking forward to the day that I make my Grandmaster trophy
for each of my 3 characters that tradeskill, as that has the same bonus, and
adds in wisdom and int as well.
