After reading your post, I would have to say EQ probably isn't your
ideal MMORPG. You may still like it, and considering the price you are
seeing you should probably give it a try. I will address your specific
points individually.

I believe that the Euro version of EQ requires you to play on the Euro
server, so some of my points below are moot. The Euro server is a
standard Blue server if I remember correctly, so there is no PK's at
all. (Except the red-names, though they can only kill other red-names,
assuming they can find one.)

>Questions:

There are a number of scammers in EQ, but with a little common sense
you can avoid them completely. (i.e. Don't play the "casino" games
offered by players.) As for the rest, they all depend on if you choose
a PvP server or not. If you choose on of the standard "blue" servers,
they are not a problem at all. (again with a little common sense.)
There are some immature people who will do annoying things, but
generally the EQ player base is quite mature. Particularly on the
Firiona Vie server, reputation can go a long way towards making people
act respectable. (but it's by no means complete.)

>2) Risk

>(died about 5 times in 5 years in tibia, where a

In the low levels, you can die without penalty at all (except loosing
any buffs you had cast on you, and reverting back to your position at
your bind point. This is sometimes used by players as a quick way to
get back home.) however this protection ends at level 10. Below level
20 you will likely not die too often if you are careful, but beyond
that it all depends on your play style and your skill. In my case I've
died about 12 times more often than you have in the last 5 years in
EQ, though I've really only had about 3 years play time.

>3) Leveling threadmill

>not as a test of my diligence. I want to explore

>monster or two (like you do in single-player RPGs).

You can explore a great deal of the world by level 20, if you are
careful. However, EQ at it's heart is nothing more than a leveling
treadmill. The players themselves make it more, if you are willing to
participate.

>4) "Downtimes"
>Can you play in a continouus way without
>regeneration/repairing pauses?

Yes, with the right equipment or the right class. EQ over the years
has tried to limit the amount of downtime even a solo player has, but
there is still a considerable amount of downtime for many classes that
hunt solo. In a group, you can fight nearly continuously if you have a
good mix and skillful players. (Or again, the right equipment.)

>5) Groups
>I'd like to play alone most the time, and
>sometimes join a group.

You can play solo if you choose the right class. In some cases some
classes solo better than they do in groups at particular times. (i.e.
Beastlord or Necromancer.)  However, don't expect to make significant
progress in EQ unless you group (barring the aforementioned classes)
as EQ has since the beginning been a primarily group oriented game.

>6) Level usefullness
>I tend to level slower than my friends.
>Can a low level still be helpfull to a high
>level group ?

In almost any situation, no. (Which is one of my biggest problems with
EQ. It really ticked me off when I first started.) However, once you
reach the higher levels the level spread gets much wider however.

>7) Battle system
>Reading about monsters hitting through walls, ignoring
>height, and hitting from impossible places sounds
>awfull in theory. How does this affect the actual
>gameplay? Can you do ANY tactics (like hide behind
>walls, ranged attack on melee monsters from places
>they can't reach, etc) in the battles ?

No. (Another one of my problems with EQ.)  Any such thing, in real
life would be considered good tactics, in EQ these are exploits.
That's not to say EQ has no tactics, there are a great many tactics
you will need to learn, based on your class. However, using the
environment to your advantage in EQ is an exploit, if you can get it
to work in the first place. However, it's not that much of a loss for
EQ, the game works just fine without such tactics.

>8) Speed
>Having a first person perspective ... is
>EQ as quick as 3D shooters, or a less
>hectical experience ?

Much slower than most modern shooters. With the right speed enhancing
equipment or spells you can move as fast or faster than you can on
most shooters, but the actual pace of the game is much slower. There
can be times where you will have to react quickly (such as when your
group is about to wipe) but overall the game pace is quite sedate
compared to a shooter.

>9) Lag
>How much Lag or server inavailabilites
>do i have to expect (german user on ADSL)

I can't say for sure. I understand Euro DSL is slower than what you
can get in the states... However EQ is designed from the beginning to
run on 33.6k modem. So you should be fine as long as your ping isn't
too bad. Most lag in game these days comes from video lag.

>10) Extensions
>How much will i miss as a newbie by not
>owning PoP, LoY and LDoN ?

Not at all. The only PoP zone you will miss is Plane of Knowledge, and
that is included free to all players, so no problem there. LoY and
LDoN don't be come even useable until you game a few levels. LDoN
first becomes useable at level 20 (which might take you a week or two
depending on how quickly you pick up the game. I can get level 20 in
less than 8 hours these days.) however, people don't start seriously
using the place until the 30's. You can get by just fine without it
all the way to the ends game. But it is a nice diversion. LoY doesnï¿½t
really become useable until you mid 20's, and most people don't go
there 'till their mid 30's. It's a unique place, but not necessary at
all. The content from the first 4 dwarf LoY into almost
insignificance.
