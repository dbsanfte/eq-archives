I've seen any number of decent drops for a wide variety of classes.  Most 
groups I am in do NBG, even pickup groups.  Last decent drop was randomed 
to all, as it was chain only, and neither I, nor the 2 rangers would wear 
it.  I only knew one other person in the group, not a guild group, or a 
group of friends.
