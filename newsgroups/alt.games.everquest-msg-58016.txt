Hehe, I'm used to hearing how people fly thru levels but if you level slow
(like I do) and don't expect to make 37 anytime soon then I'd suggest
selling it now for whatever you can get...when you are 37 the price will be
lower still.

Not sure on the pricing on Xev but if you are a Warrior I'd try and get a
Cane of Tranquil for it 11/25 (1hb) much better ratio and it'd be a good
time to start on your 1hb skill anyway (assuming you haven't already)
