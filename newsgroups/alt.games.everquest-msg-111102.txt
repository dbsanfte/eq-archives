After being long absent from Norrath, and realizing that I was still paying
for the account (d'oh), I decided I'd try EQ again, and see if I still
wanted to play it before canceling the account.  However, in the months
since I last logged on, I bought a new computer, so I had to install EQ
again.  I fired it up, and what do you know, my login still worked.
However, I can't access the servers.  When I try, the screen blacks out and
the program freezes... I have to Ctrl-Alt-Del to get back to the desktop.

I emailed the customer service folks, and they seem to think that it's a
problem with my cable modem - but there was no problem before with my old
computer.  I wonder if anyone here can help me?

The computer specs:

    Pentium 4 1.7 GHz
    512 meg PC2100 RAM
    20 gig HD
    3dfx Voodoo 3 2000 video card (32 meg) (same as in old computer)
    16X DVD-ROM drive
    Plus ethernet card, a drive, and all that other good stuff.

Any help would be appreciated.  I'm finding that although my EQ addiction
faded, the total inability to play has fired it up again.  Ain't people
weird?

Cheers,
Nathan Campbell
