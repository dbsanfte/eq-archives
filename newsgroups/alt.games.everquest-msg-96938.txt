I agree with you, if it got THAT easy I'd quit myself.  But let's not
overreact, this game has a looooong way to go bofore its as empty as AO or
even DAoC.  Y'all talk like every brand new player is gonna be 60 in a week.
CALM DOWN.  You will still be alone at the top for a significant amount of
time before a new player will be interfering with your one of a kind
success.  Getting rid of the spell book or letting people level to 30 a
LITTLE faster is hardly babyiing anyone.  Go play Camelot and come back, see
what an easy game really looks like!  ;)
As for "dumming down" the game gimme a break.  What do you suppose is the
minumum IQ required to succeed in everquest?  Consider some of the people
you've met in game, or in the newsgroup before you answer.  Levelling takes
free time and patience, not a doctorate.
