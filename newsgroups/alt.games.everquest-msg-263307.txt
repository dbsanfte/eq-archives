I suppose we are jumping the gun a bit here anyways. They just lifted
the NDA, they didn't announce they had gone gold. Could all just be
just to raise their profile, after all with the NDA in place WoW was
becoming pretty much the only mmorpg anyone was talking about.

Seen how Sims cook in Sims 2? :-p

Here's a question for you: the key difference in WoW's quests is that
you can only do them once. Same hold true for EQ2 or is it more like
EQ1's where you can do them as many times as you want (which is
probably the reason that lies behind the fact most of them had crap
for rewards)?

Makes it hard to save someone's life. I'm not sure I'd like such a
hold-my-hand system.

Actually, when it comes down to it, this "no interactivity with
others" issue with EQ2 is as much a problem for me as the "everyone is
exactly the same" issue with WoW. Am I just too damn difficult to
please? I *liked* trains in other mmorpgs. I *wanted* to deal with
people. That's what I played mmorpgs *for*.

Another hold-my-hand implementation. I am displeased.

Would have to see it to have an opinion.

Disappointing, but not unexpected. This dev team includes many who
were responsible for Nexus (Luclin) and Plane of Knowledge (PoP).

There was a time when being one of the people willing to take the risk
of long recovery times by going to exotic places gave you the reward
of more and better things to hunt. With all this instant travel, that
differentiator - a form of mmorpg skill, if you will - is gone. Now
every noob feels safe going everywhere.

Well, maybe its not quite the doom I mentioned, then. We shall see.

Seems familiar, I think I've seen that somewhere before....

Raiding? I thought there was little to no raiding in EQ2.

This would be one of the major departures from WoW's gameplay anyways.
In WoW, tradeskill loot appears to be subpar at almost all levels.

Hmm. That is a very smart idea, and one I don't think WoW thought of,
for all its vaunted quest system.

Of course, given how much mmorpgs steal from each other anyways, I
give it a week before its put in anyways.
