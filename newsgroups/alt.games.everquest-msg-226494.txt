    You've just described many of the encounters in PoP. :-) But then you
run into the healing issue: to make these encounters challenging, they need
to have a chance of killing off the tanks. So the tanks need healers, every
last one of them. So the busier you try to make the encounter for offtanks,
the more people will be needed to execute the encounters and those people
need to be certain classes. Phase one of Time is a great example of this -
you need to make groups a specific way, or you're going to have a weakness
than could turn into a wasted hour.
