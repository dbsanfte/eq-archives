I heard about the hermit in SK and have just taken him on twice. He's
tough for me as a L19 ranger but I managed to beat him both times with
a sliver of health left.

Usually I flamelick him to get him out, then melee him till my health
is half, root him then use arrows on him with an occasional lightning,
saving enough mana to keep him rooted when he starts to run (otherwise
he goes back in the house and you can't get in)

I need to do more damage. For some reason dual wield hardly ever goes
up, it's only at 49 so I don't get too many extra hits in. I also read
that my damage is capped until level 20 ? I usually hit for 20-23
damage, will this increase when I hit level 20 ?

As for the bow, it only hits for max of 16 damage. How can I dish out
more damage with the bow ? I bought a ashwood bow and i'm making class
3 wood point arrows (fletching 75). But it's a slow process killing
anything with it and i'm always running out of both mana and arrows as
it takes a lot of arrows and roots spells to kill anything. I see
sometimes I do a critical hit for around 35 damage. What determines
when you get a critical hit ?

Is there anywhere close that I can buy arrow components ? The centaur
village sells bower supplies but not arrow components. I had to run
all the way back to west edge of WK to the barbarian village to buy
them.

With kick, is there anyway to increase the damage that it does ? Can
you get magical boots that add to damage ?
