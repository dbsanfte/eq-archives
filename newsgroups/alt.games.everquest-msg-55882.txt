You should only have trouble with the guilds (Cleric, Necro/SK and Warriors,
in Neriak Commons) The general populace of Neriak should be fine (dubious at

my agnostic human rogue and Berox worshipping SK are both safe away from the
Guilds.

To gain faction with the indigo brotherhood (think this covers SK's and
Warriors, not sure about other guilds) you can kill the Elves on the island
outpost in Timorus Deep.
