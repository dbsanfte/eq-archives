  I'm glad to not that I'm not the only one that wants to
play a gnome monk.  Of course, what I _really_ want is troll
monk.  I know it doesn't make sense from a role-playing
aspect, but I think it would be fun.  Personally, I think
that trolls and ogres should have more classes open to
them.  The only thing holding me back from playing one now
is they can't really hold any "jobs" that I want to play
(other than shaman, and my shaman slot was taken as Barb as
my first real character, before I knew better, and I don't
want to delete her for sentimental reasons, though I am
thinking about it anyways).  Anyways, I wish there was more
of an incentive to play the big, ugly types.

    Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel about it also.  But
for my younger characters, and I almost always have  younger
characters due to my endless curiosity about other classes,
this is great. But, still, it does make the game, at least
in those levels, easier, and the thing I love about EQ the
most is that it is NOT an easy game.  For a true newbie, the
no CR is presenting EQ as a fundamentally different game
than it really is.  Luckily, those first 10 levels do go by
faster, so less time is spent in them.  And when they do
ding 11 for the first time, and have to do that first CR,
they have more time to do it, since their body won't rot for
a week.  I remember the frustration I felt when one of my
very first experimental characters somehow wandered all the
way from Halas to somewhere it West Karana at level 3, only
to be eaten by a lion. I didn't have much gear or money on
me, but what I did have was important to me at the time. 
And my body did rot before I found it again.  If the same
thing were to happen to a level 11 today, they would at
least have plenty of time to wander around and find it
again, but still learn the importance of taking a /loc.  For
true newbies, I think getting rid of the CR is a bad thing
too, but not one that is likely to do critical harm.

Is it?  Really?  I dunno.  Yes, some people are bitching
about it, but I think that far more saw it as 
inevitable.  Personally, I saw it as no more controversial
as when the local Albertson's raised the price on a bottle
of barbeque sauce by a nickel.  I don't think that the
Premium Server is making enough of ripple to be
controversial at all.  It's available.  If I want it, I can
get it.  I've decided that its not worth the price. Many
others, most others in fact, have made the same decision. 
Where's the controversy in that?

   I guess we can consider this to be a sort of veiled plug
for whatever Brad is working on right now.  I think it will
be interesting to see how many people go with whatever this
project is when it gets released.  I don't know how many of
the bulk of EQ know that Brad had a hand in the formation of
EQ (I certainly didn't, until I became a regular in this
NG).  But of the ones that do, I would suspect that a fair
number of them, rightly or wrongly, might associate him with
some of the bigger PITA aspects of the game, for example,
the soul-binder issue.  Sticking to a roleplaying ideal
vision is a noble goal, IMO, but it also needs to be
balanced with the day to day business of actually having fun
in a game.
