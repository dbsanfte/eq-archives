You don't even have to leave the area to build faction. There is a quest where you deliver tailoring supplies and a bag of gems back
and forth between Staeon in SH and Gearo in Bazaar that builds faction. After about 20 trips you should be able train and but and
sell in SH.

BTW you don't have to stop for the plants in Echo to get you. They will root even you run past. Just don't get too close and you
will be ok.
