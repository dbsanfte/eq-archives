Illegal does not equal wrong.  Is there any reason people SHOULDN'T be
allowed to walk around naked?  I mean, I don't WANT to see a 300 pound
man walking around naked, but it would hardly be something bad I
think.

While fitting in isn't in and of itself a bad thing, humans are a herd
animal, I don't think people should be penalized just for NOT fitting
in.  Most of the really great things that have come about in human
history have come about because of people who specifically DON'T fit
in.

Note: I am not equating people who swear all the time with fringe
thinks and movers and shakers.  I'd even go so far as to say that
using foul language is pretty much middle of the road for most
societies.  It's one of those things that people like to think is
fringe, but just gives that illusion.

Won't argue that point at all.  But where is the fun in doing things
the easy way.  :-)

What if you don't get any kind of thrill from using foul language at
all, rather it just seems like the best way to express yourself at
times?  

I can honestly say this is exactly how I look at it.

I know that often do things for no other reason than to conform, but I
don't like that in myself and I do try to NOT do that.  

I am very much part of the "flock", but I like to think that I'm at
least the black sheep. :-)
