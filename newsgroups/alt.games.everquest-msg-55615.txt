I enjoyed it too! As an Iksar Monk who'd gone to EK to hunt for spider silks the
event was great fun. At lvl 25 there wasn't much in the way of experience there,
esp. when you can't hit ghouls, but the number of spider silks I looted more
than made up for that. The Monk only headband was really just an added bonus!
Unfortunately the only spoiler, at least for me, was the constant cry from
looters looking for special items. It was like going on an easter egg hunt with
some whining brat constantly demanding to know where all the eggs were. Other
than that, I give it the thumbs up! :)
