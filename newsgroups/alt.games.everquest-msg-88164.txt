On Rodcet Nife.

Noticed last night in the Bazaar and Nexxus, there were "pesky
mosquitos" flying up people's noses.  Then there were unearthly
shrieks that caused peoples ears to bleed. These were just random
little messages that were popping up.  Other stuff about "chill winds"
and some such as well.  

Then some serverwide messages about the undead in Befallen spilling
out into Norrath around midnight CST.  The EC tunnels became a morgue
about then...  kinda funny, actually - all the auction mules were
slaughtered wholesale.  Sky was Red in EC and WC after midnight.

Ok, shortly after that caught a message about (something) laying waste
to all the bears in Surefall Glade.  Was back on the moon then, so
didn't get a chance to run over and check it out.  

Oh - and hours before all that, watched and participated in several
total party wipeouts in DL at the North Wall.  Didn't really want to
be in DL anyways, then this mad NPC monk (name started with a V - I'd
type the whole thing, but then would have flashbacks.  The Horror!!)
pretty much mowed down everyone along the wall for a while.  Nobody
seemed to know who he was or what his function was to be.  But he ate
my 41 cleric and a 41 tank in about 30 seconds and moved on to many
others as well.  Zone line to KC looked like a MASH unit later on.

Ok, that's all I know.
