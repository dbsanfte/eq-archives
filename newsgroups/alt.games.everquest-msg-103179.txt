Ann Curry,  it sounds like you are ready to hunt down all hispanic
looking men.
How do they know that the man was hispanic and not one of the many
groups
that can pass for hispanic, example Italians, Greeks, Filipino,...? 
This article, and the way you chose to title it ("....hunting white
children") is a perfect example of poor reporting that can incite
racial violence. I conclude that you sound like a poorly informed
racist propagandist.

Just a concerned white man.
