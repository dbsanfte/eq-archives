I'm not sure how you stumbled over the a.g.e group to post this question
but so be it. I changed the title to make it Off Topic though.

As you did mention more than 2GB free disk space it might be the
problem. I don't know how old RT3 is but 2GB was a magical limit once.
The install program might be confused about your disc size. You could
try to fill the disc so it gets below 2GB free space and try to
install again.

Another hint would be to post on the proper forums. Chances are the
problem is well known already. ;)
