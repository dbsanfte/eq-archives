I ran big ol' ogre SK out to the ulthork tree in EW this morning.  Had the
entire zone to myself.  I guess it's too far out of the way.  I mean, heck
... it'a a whole zone away from a book.

I have four ulthork tusks on him now.  Wonder if I can find someone to port
him to CS ?  I want to do the quest, for old time's sake.

I remember ulthorks being overcrowded.  The orc fort was always under
attack.  People were donating for the ability to loot snow griff eggs.
Every so often you'd hear the shout of "Snow Bunny train to IC!".  Some
folks thought it was annoying.

I kinda miss it.
