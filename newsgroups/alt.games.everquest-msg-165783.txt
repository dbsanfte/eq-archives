Why should we deprive ourselves of one of the tools available to
try and achieve our goals?  The governments (and there are many, the
federal government dwarfs the others, but even it is no monolith)
are, after all, part of us.  Still, if you can come up with sound
reasons for excluding government action in this matter I would quite
honestly like to hear them, less work for goverment at least opens
the possibility of less government and lower taxes.
