   Lenny was having the same problem with Stonebrunt and the Warrens. 
He deleted the file names of the zone from the EQ folder, and re-ran the
optional patch (Velious would be appropriate for your case, of course). 
Suddenly snakes and gnolls looked more like one would expect them to.
    Failing that, if you need, I can send you the disk.  Respond here if
you're going to send me email on this matter so I can go look it up; I
rarely check the abenlen@yahoo.com account.
