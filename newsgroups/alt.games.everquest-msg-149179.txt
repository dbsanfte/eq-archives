Id expect any chanter with a clue would have at least 1 AE stun and 1 single
target stun up ALWAYS.  having trouble getting mez to land?  tash, stun,
mez, stun, mez..  mob gating?  use that same stun spell

huh?  the chanter is doing no dps.. the cleric is doing none to minimal
dps.. i know which classes id rather have cast stun to not decrease dps
