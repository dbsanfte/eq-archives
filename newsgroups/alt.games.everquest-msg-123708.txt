No, no, no.

There has not been a recent change.

WIS/INT for ALL tradeskills is used for determining the chance of a skillup.
The ONLY factor in determining success is your skill level vs the trivial
level of what you are creating.

In the case of smithing in particular, STR is an alternate stat for
determining skillups, instead of WIS/INT.

In the case of Tailoring and Fletching I believe, DEX is an alternate stat
for determining skillups.

The one thing that Verant has consistantly said is that WIS/INT is used
strictly for determining skillups, and that only the skill level is used in
determining successes.  (Well, consistantly for the past 18 months or so
anyway, don't know about before that).

The thing that they have waffled on is whether or not some other stat has
any effect on skillups.  According to their latest statement, some
tradeskills do have an alternate stat.  Smithing has STR, and Tailoring and
Fletching have DEX.

The reason serious tradeskillers get a high WIS or INT is because they want
the skillups to occur as quickly as possible to reduce the cost and time
involved.  The reason they get a Geerlock or other tradeskill enchancement
item is because they want to increase the chance of success.
