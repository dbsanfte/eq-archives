I own PoP, but I have an EQ installation that has only 
original+kunark+luclin installed, for my bazaar trader. (It seemed like a 
good idea at the time, but I haven't seen any real, proven benefit to this 
approach, but having gone to the effort, I may as well use it.  Except 
when I forget, and log to another character on that install, and try to 
take the GD stone, it hasn't been too annoying.)  A while back, running 
the patch on this install downloaded PoK zone files, and all the books do 
indeed work (ok, except PoT, obviously.)  So you can definitely use the 
PoK books without a full PoP install if you own PoP.  It seems illogical 
that it would only work if you owned PoP and had not installed it, 
however.  Note that this install also lacked 'optional zones', such as 
warrens/JPF.

Actually, come to think of it, I think my extremely temporary free mule 
account was able to use the books too.  Won't swear to it, though.

And before someone asks, "but why install Kunark?", It's because both of 
my basic game CDs also include kunark.  So the reason is, in fact, kinda 
stupid.
