Precisely. Why do people 'whine' about these 'must-have-features' in the
expansions? Because of the perceived relative value,... I paid the same $$
as an 'uberguildie' when my highest level character is 30th... the ONLY
feature of PoP i will use for months to come yet is the book portals... EQ2
will surely be out before I get to 65th... so I may never see a single plane
other than knowledge. They got a whole new world to explore... I paid the
same amount, but my only tangible benefit is that it doesn't take me 20
minutes to get from freeport to qeynos now. Still very valuable to me... but
an utter colossal rip off compared to what the 65th level player got for his
30 bucks. Especially when you consider that for me its not even new content,
quests, zones... for me it qualifies almost as a bug fix... spending 30
minutes on a boat/waiting for a boat is not 'playing the game'. Its wasting
the time that I have available to play the game. .

Don't get me wrong, I didn't think travel was a bad thing... and I don't
prefer that it takes no time at all to cross the world... but if the world
is going to be wide, it should be an 'adventure to cross'... not turn on
autorun and try not to fall asleep... or worse sit absolutely still and try
not to fall asleep. And in a game where grouping is imperative, making me
spend the better part of an hour getting to one is nonsense... so PoP was a
necessity... and making all the lowbies shell out 30.00 bucks... may be good
business sense.

But its not earning them any loyalty... and in an environment where new
mmogs come out regularly, and few players are willing to subscribe to more
than one or two... the only things keeping players in a game is retention of
their investment into friends and characters and loyalty to the postive game
experience and perception of good value for the money. Lowbies don't have
that investment...and so they are the most likely to drop EQ in favour of a
competitor... coercing them to pay for what are effectively glorified bug
fixes isnt terribly bright as a business decision.
