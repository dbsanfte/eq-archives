In this group you have a few options.

For one, the necro can keep one mob under wraps using Screaming Terror. 
This would be my preference in that group.

The other good option is the mage using an earth pet. When using pets 
everyone must know their limitations- for example, no mob will attack a pet 
if a PC is in range.

IMO and IME Atone is one of those spells that Should Have Been Cool. In 
reality, it's not all that great.
