Hi.....

I got kicked from the game while in Black Burrow on level 2. Tryed to get
back in, but the game crashed each time it had loaded. After trying this 5/6
times i was suddenly back outside Halas without my stuff, then i moved to BB
again, but the game crashes each time i get near the BB level 2. Now i cant
even proceed without my stuff, becourse the game crashes just when loading
ends. I am only Level 13, so its survivable if my stuuf is lost(50pp
lifetime savings). I would be happy if i could continue without my
stuff(only money and some basic gear)

    Claus
