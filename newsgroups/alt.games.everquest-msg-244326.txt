Heh, just done this for me and several other guild mates. We thought the
same for a while getting very depressed. Then it was pointed out that
there are named in the spawn list and they won't get the chop if people
are looking for foragers. Various websites list vaqrious named but we had
a Hierophant named who wasn't in any weblist we found and wasn't even a
frog (DE I think). Someone else decided to butcher said named and lo
Foragers returned.
