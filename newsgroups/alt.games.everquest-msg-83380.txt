I appreciate your response, but I do understand that they cannot be
use as a BS weapon, but I use them when needing extra damage between
BS's.  
I know to play the game the way you want to play becasue it is your
game, but If you feel that I should not switch weapons between the
dirk and icetooth claws... what should I do... never change from the
piercer?   Different weapon to change?

thanks again.
