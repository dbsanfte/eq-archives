A nice spot for you two might be in Nadox.  If you go in through the lava
entrance, go left and take the left tunnel.  All these mobs will be undead.
There is one wanderer inside the tunnel.  You should easily be able to slow
these mobs and heal the shadow knight if he needs it, so he can tank.  These
mobs do not summon or run when low on health.  If you fight over to the
bridge, you will find some zombies who hit harder and enrage, but should
still be doable by the two if you.  Occationally a named will pop out of the
dead body of one of the regular mobs.  He hits a bit harder and enrages, but
still easy enough - just get him slowed quick. Best of luck!  I sometimes
come here still and solo. I get 1% aa off of the regular zombies and 2% off
the ones that enrage.
