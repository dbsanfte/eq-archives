And then what do you do? Ban both the sellers and the buyers? I'm sure SOE
will be working round the clock to reduce their monthly income, not.

I've spoken to one of the very top CS guys at Sony about this very issue,
when I offered names of people who farmed plat for sale he wasn't
interested, they simply don't have the time nor the inclination.

Oh and for the record, I have never sold or bought plat/items from any
source other than with the loot I won or bought ingame.
