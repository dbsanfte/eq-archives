I -guess- thats OK, although I have a nagging feeling that voting any 
day but The Day is wrong unless you really weren't going to be able to 
make it.

What if something had come out over the weekend that suddenly made me 
-not- want to vote the way I did?  Right up till today I could change my 
mind, in fact, this same logic almost makes me want to wait till near 
the close of polls to vote...

But since I started this post on the idea that voting early is a good 
thing, I can't really complain that you voted over a week ago.  Not like 
I didn't know who I was going to vote for back then, either.
