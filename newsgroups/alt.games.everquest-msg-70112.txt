LOL!

My 50 Druid "ALWAYS" has enough mana to heal (if I'm primary or
back-up healer), evac, and snare the runners. Anything less, and I am
not doing my job.

There is nothing harder on mana than an unexpected add. Every class in
the group with a "snare" spell should be ready willing and able to use
it at all times. (Same thing goes for root, even if you have a
Ench/Bard for CC. You never know when things will go wrong.)

Cheers
