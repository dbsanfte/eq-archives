4 hours of killing in Unrest of yellows and reds should ahve netted you
close to lvl 16. The exp in Unrest is very very good. Go to Crushbone and
get a throne room group. Befallen is good and will get you a lot of exp and
while going that way give Oasis a go, although it is a little packed. You
could solo wisps in the commons, they should still give exp. Once lvl 16 go
to Lake of Ill Omen, lot of exp to be had there.
