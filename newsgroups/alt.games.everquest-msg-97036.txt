Not really. Its two different things. They said the XP TABLE can't be
changed and hell was part of the XP TABLE. Guess what? The XP TABLE is
not being changed. What we have is Verant Voodoo Math(tm) which was
exactly what they used for hybrids. The hybrid xp penalty STILL EXISTS
as far as the XP TABLE is concerned. It was solved artificially by
taking xp they earned times 1.4, since their XP TABLE (okay, I'ill
quit capitalizing that) was roughly 40 percent more xp needed.

So, though verant won't say how because some players would be
sticklers for possible non bonuses, what is happening is the exact
same thing. The xp table is not changing but verant is using Voodoo
Matchmagics to take the XP you get in level 45 and multiply it like:

If player = level 45 multiply xp X 1.5 

Of course doing that means, in order to still need X million (same as
before ) xp to reach 51, that you have to divide somewhere else. Very
likely the place they will divide is the previous BONUS LEVEL! after
level 45, which would be level 46. Oh no! So now level 46 is slower?
Yes, probably in all liklihood level 46 will be slower.. but.. ADDED
BONUS! Previously you lost HUGE xp in a level like 46 post a hell
level and they say they are doing away with that so the xp loss in 46
will also be divided. What you end up with is saying that in all
liklihood, unless you don't die at all in 46, it will probably take
you not very much longer to get through 46.

The reason why verant is not actually stating the formula they are
using, is because players who had already gone through 45 would say
"oh.. but I had a heck level in 45 so where is my 46 fast and easy
level?" Such players would not be seeing the big overall picture of
generally leveling faster for everyone.

Doubt it. Its a different thing. Old eq was 1 -50. When kunark came
along they had to CHANGE large mobs like Styrina Fearnon (wood elf
leader of sisters on sisters island ) from level 50 to level 60 or
more. Otherwise, a level 60 could of course easily kill her (which is
not verant's intention) Lots of mobs in the old world had to be
changed, encounters like vox and naggy had to be changed, Fear and
hate were even eventually changed to reflect the fact they'd be being
done by people all level 60.

Guess what? That took tons of work and was ONLY the old world. Now, if
they changed the level limit from 60 to 70, guess what? That is right,
they'd have to:

1) rework the old world for a 70 limit
2) rework kunark for a 70 limit
3) rework velious for a 70 limit
4) reworkd Luclin for a 70 limit

Now, think about ALL they had to rework in the MUCH SMALLER and less
to rework old world. In order to change the level limit to 70.. they'd
have to have people working on the changes for probably 2 years before
it went live. Thats an awful lot of work to do for a change that is
really only going to make players feel they have more to accomplish.

So, guess what verant did instead... guess what broke the level 60
limit in a much better way? Yep, you guessed it:

Alternate Advance. 

They already did break the 60 limit, the wall came down. Alternate
Advance is the logical way to do it with no rebalancing. For the first
time even people with a full level 60 are nuts for xp. For people like
me who are only level 55 or 56.. it adds literally years on to the
life of one character for us. You could choose to split xp between
leveling and alt advance now, or you could rush to 60 then get alt
advance, either way the game is FAR from over. The 60 things are so
expensive and the 55 things are so nice (and even some 51 things) that
it will take even the greatest xp getter a long time and lots of work
to exhaust the possiblities for improvement. There is no limit, after
you get 10 more wis points you could get 10 more charisma points as a
druid. As a melee type you have TONS of stuff to improve, nearly every
stat will help you some.. even charisma for npc prices (and for many
melee charisma might be low, especially if troll or ogre)

So they already fixed the 60 limit with Luclin. Now with all this
other stuff we are really playing EQ 2 now. The only things left to do
are to redesign old zones like freeport, west karana, East commons etc
to jive with the rest of the updated more improved world and dump them
in. Imagine an East commons where you never heard "orcs are camped, GO
AWAY." but instead an area which was more like lake of ill omen with
TONS of orc camps and a cave with orcs and an orc leader. This is the
future and the direction I think they should now go in. Start with the
old world and "fix" it to have the same great mob density of areas in
the newer world. Areas like scarlet desert in Luclin have unlimited
mobs when compared to areas like EC. 15 or so people in EC means that
the orc camps are exhausted and there is nothing more for people that
level to do really. 200 people in scarlet desert would not be enough
to cause it to be overcamped.
