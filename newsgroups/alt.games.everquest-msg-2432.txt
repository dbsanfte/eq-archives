Ok I just found a really cool side game inside of EQ called Gems, just issue
the command /gems
Is this a generally known fact?  If I had known I could do this I NEVER
would have killed off my lvl 30 Mage (He died of boredom whilst medding :-)
Are there any other side games?  Anything else to kill boredom during
downtime?  Please let me know
Sincerely
Morpain (deceased lvl 30 Mage Ayonea Ro)
