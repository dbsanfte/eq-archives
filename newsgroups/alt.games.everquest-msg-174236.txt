I've seen lag kills before, I'm a 65 cleric, you don't get there
without encountering a wide variety of deaths.

This is the first time I've seen a nice heathy red bar with a body for
more than a second or two; five minutes later he -still- showed 40%
hp, and I had no ongoing lag, cause I was perfectly capable of healing
the SA, plus the MA and I and the rest of the group had a conversation
about the phenomenum in real time.

5 minutes of Deeeeeeeeep lag might happen, but I wouldn't have been
able to chat about it or heal effectively.

I'm sure this was also some sort of lag enduced deal, but its the
first time I've ever seen it or heard of it, I'm wondering if its a
-new- bug, instead of just a rare one I've somehow missed seeing in
the past.
