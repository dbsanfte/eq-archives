Similar thing happened in our rather large 100+ guild, one poor fella must
have been involved in a rather and meaningful discussion with someone at the
time;

Poor Bastid /gu: "yes, but I am saving myself for marriage or at least
someone <very> special".

Of course, our guild being a bunch of adults took the whole thing in stride
most maturely... and quit laughing and joking at him about 30 minutes after
he had logged out in embarrassment...
