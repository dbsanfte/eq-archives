What part of "back side of the moon" don't you understand?  Perhaps the 
part about there not being any druid rings there, meaning to re-establish 
their bind point the druid will have to run possibly quite a long way?  
Not to mention waiting for the spires.  Sure, it could be up to an hour or 
so's "minor inconvenience".
