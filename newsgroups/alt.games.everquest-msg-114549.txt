Perhaps, just perhaps I was a tad too sweeping in my generalization but please
note I  said *truly objective* and used that as a qualifier. If the guild
leadership violates the trust bestowed on it by the lowly rank and file playing
favorites by assigning loot according to seniority (i.e. plank owners get the
bulk of the loot) you WILL have those unnecessary support classes like clerics,
chanters and druid find a more objective and even handed guild.

How can you tell if a guild is biased toward chronyism? Well if it allows
PLing, if it assigns loot according to a claimed *fair system* which
objectively really is not, if it permits the unabashed twinking of alts, and if
you see the same *seniors* grouped all the time to thje point one could say you
are either *in* or *out* with the leadership, then it's probably a  shitty
guild.

Yes a guild raid is or should be all about bettering the guild and assisting a
guild member complete a quest or assist facilitating completing his or her
epic. But I remind you, even the appearance of favoritism IS favoritism. But
this seems a one way street in some guilds (not all). If for example, I am
expected to assist another (usually more senior to use your expression) guild
member I will. I will also assist a contemporary as well. There is an
expectation that when you need or want some guild assistance in completeling
one of YOUR quests  such assistince is also forthcoming yes? Wrong. In a  few
*Favoritism cum elite*  guilds of my acqualitance, it seems to be pretty much a
one way street.

But I do confess it is a tricky catch phrase; appealing to the more noble and
trusting elements of the guild. It simply needs to be reinforced by deed and
not rhetoric.

You suggest a 50 and up cleric is not a guild asset?  Fine. Eat the experience
loss when you die. Neither a Druid? Fine. Walk and forget about those group
buffs, and back up healing. Or a NEC? Good. Forget about getting that body out
of Seb and his use as a mana pump. Etc.

Odd the people being called *loot whores* here are those who don't get the
loot.

Anyone want to comment on such a guild using the rationalization of having
*experience groups*?  Well you do employ such a *concept do you not? For the
betterment of the guild of course.
