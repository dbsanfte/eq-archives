Not played the original EQ but losing your gear sounds like hell to me.
It bad enough losing soul shards in EQ2 and having to get them. I've
died many times trying to get and totally failed in one case and had to
rest the char for a week to get it back. Zero fun in my books and it
will turn people off the game fast.

In my opinion the best game for debt is one you didn't mention, Guild
Wars. If you die your char becomes 15% weaker up to a maximum of 60%.
At 60% the mission might become impossible to do and you have to quit
but once you do the debt goes away. So, there's no permanent effect
but losing hours of play is enough to stop people treating death easy.

As for SOE copying ideas, if you played EQ2 for longer you would know
they've been copying everything WoW and GW offers in an effort to get
subscribers. Some of the changes are good and necessary but I don't
think make EQ2 like it competitors will get many new subs just stop
people from leaving.
