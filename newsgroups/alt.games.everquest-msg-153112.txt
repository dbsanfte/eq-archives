Difficult?  None.  (unless your guild cannot kill Trakanon, in which case
you have no business in VP either.)

Massive timesinks?  Almost all.

Bloodgill Marauder - 8 hour spawn, no placeholder
Ancient Jarsath - some say random super rare spawn, some say PH, nobody
seems to know.    Wanders around FV, hard to find up.  Took me a couple days
of logging in a cleric to sense undead.
Rotting Skeleton - PH on a 7 minute spawn.   Rotting skeleton is super rare
pop.  Most get him after an average of 5 to 7 hours camping him.  Some as
high as 11.
Pained Soul - Ditto Rotting skeleton, right down to spawn time.  Even rarer
pop though, most people spend an average of 7 to 8 hours camping him. Some
as high as 15 - 20 hours.  (that I've heard, and Joe just posted it took him
30, and I have no reason to doubt)
Swamp of no players groundspawn - 8 hour or so respawn
Kaesora groundspawn - 8 or so hours respawn.  No way to know if it is up
without fighting down and looking.

Trakanon - 3 day respawn, takes a raid to kill, drops 2 - 5 teeth.


I think the cleric above was exadurating or nuts, but it really is a pretty
shitty quest unless you get other people to MQ you all of the pieces.
