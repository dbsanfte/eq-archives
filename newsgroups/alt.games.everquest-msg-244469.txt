I remember a discussion about this a while back.  From what I can 
remember,  the China firewalls will keep you off the servers. OTOH, I've 
also heard that some hotels are set up to bypass those firewalls so 
westerners didn't have to deal with them.  There was talk of making a 
China only version so that people there could play but I haven't heard 
anything recent about it.
