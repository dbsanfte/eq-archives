Not much reason to upgrade your equipment just for the journey to
Great Divide, if you get into a fight with anything there you are
pretty much dead in the water no matter what you are wearing.

On the other hand, just take the Plane of Knowledge portals to the
Great Divide, and follow the wall to the right (west I believe). If
you go slow you won't take falling damage and kill your self (try
ducking while you walk on the steep grades) and about once you get to
the waterfall you are at Thurg. The dwarves there won't kill you, I
don't think they are KoS (kill on sight) to anyone to start. Then you
can continue around the wall, you will start to see some minataur
looking guys (Yack Men), they also are not KoS to anyone to start (so
far as I know) so you can actually hang out there (other monsters
avoid those caves where the Yack Men live.

You will eventually see someone come and start killing them. (Because
they drop some pretty nice stuff for mid 20's Beastlords. The armor is
roughly equivelent to Banded and some has stats on it, but it is
leather, so BSTs can use them. Also the experience is good too.) Those
people will usually take pitty on people and give you some of what
drops or, will sell it to you for a reasonable price.

If you ask politely, (Try "Pardon me, but would you be willing to give
me one of the Velium weapons that drop. I'm trying to get an
upgrade.") they will likely let you have one.

If you have been saving bone chips from those skeletons, (and are not
a evil race) you can head into Kaladim (dwarf city) and see Gunlok
Jure one of the Paladin guild masters. He will give you some armor
(small tattered) or another item and some coin if you give him 4
unstacked bone chips. More importantly, he will give you some good
experience for your level.
