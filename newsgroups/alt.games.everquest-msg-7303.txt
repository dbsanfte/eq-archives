Verant has a random number generator built into the game.   On good items, it
is generally how the best loot is decided.    Everyone types in /random 100
(or /random 1000 or whatever number you want to roll up to) and the person
with the highest number gets the item.  Since you will only have one good
item, and perhaps 3 or 4 people in the group able to use it (or everyone able
to sell it if it's not no-drop)...   and since the good drops are so rare that
you're very unlikely to get enough that everyone gets something before the
group breaks up, it's generally considered the fair way to distribute items.

It is called rolling since the message goes something along the lines of
"**Aplayer_01 rolls a magic die.   It could have been any number from 0 to
100, but this time it came up 58." in a default color of red.

No.   The same as characters who were stupid enough to turn in thier pvp notes
cannot be healed or buffed by any non-pvp player, a person in a duel can't,
until the duel is over.
