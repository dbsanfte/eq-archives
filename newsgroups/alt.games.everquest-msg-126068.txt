First, he has a zone wide agro list (and KoS to everybody), and death
touches every (IIRC) 30 seconds, melee hits for quad 2100 max and flurries.
When the last warder is killed, he spawns in Sleepers Tomb and proceeds to
rape the warder killers, then despawns in ST and respawns somewhere else in
Velious, kills everything (including NPCs) in the zone, despawns and moves
on to another zone.  I know he does this to Skyshrine, but I'm not sure what
other zones he goes to.

Basically though, if Kerafyrm is going to be released soon, or has started
rampaging; leave Velious for a couple days.

Manaburn clusterfuck wouldn't work, he has over 2 million hp and a gm chain
cazic-touching (10k dmg, the original DT effect) wasn't able to kill him
after at least 15 minutes back during Velious beta test(due to insane regen
rate, estimated around 8-10k/6 sec)
