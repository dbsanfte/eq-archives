No don't give the benefit of the doubt, I wouldn't want to be treated any 
different from other posters.

Nope. I couldn't even name you 3 servers. I was just trying to think
of some, and all I came up with was the 7th something [ hammer ? ]
and Mythanil Marr ? The only cities I can think of are Oggrog and 
Freeport ? 

Unless "on and off"

I AM on the idiots list, I added myself, remember ?

1. Bombelly, lev 2 [ the new luclin cat race, whatever it's called ] 
    Beastlord. [ about to disappear ].

I just rejoined a couple days ago, and had deleted all my characters.
I don't think I ever had a character above the mid-20's. I have the
re-roll sickness in all the games I play, so I've probably had 100
level 10 characters. In the 2 days I've been back I've created no less
than 10 characters. I can never seem to be satisfied with what I create.
Be thankful you don't suffer from this--it's a curse.

Nope. I played at release the longest, probably close to 6 months, 
then I'd quit to play the latest and greatest MMORPG, return to UO
or The Realm for a while etc, and eventually come back to EQ for 
a month or so with a new expansion released eg. Never really
seen anything in the game, never been in a dungeon [ they have 
those yes ? :-) ]. But no one kicks ass in newbie zones as good as me !

Good

Carrying a 6 but play to a 3 as it is. :-)
