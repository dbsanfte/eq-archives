I am a barbarian warrior (now LV7) and need to get some faction up with
Qeynos. I'm amiable to merchants (at least the ones down by the docks and in
the bar in S Qeynos), indifferent to the warrior guild (though they don't
trust me enough to let me do the warrior quest, is it race specific or do I
need to be amiable there too?), and I'm apprehensive to some. This is all up
some (guards are still indifferent) from 147 kills of gnolls in Blackburrow
caves. I have 5 gnoll teeth for the quest in Halas, but I also read of a
bone chip quest in Qeynos that would raise faction. One only lowers
bloodsabers (or something like that) faction which it says is based in the
aqueduct system that runs under Qeynos. Is it safe to roam Qeynos when KOS
to them or do they also roam the upper streets of Qeynos and would kill me?
Other than this Halas and bone chip, are there any others I can do right
now? Isn't patches of gnoll fur good for a quest somewhere?
