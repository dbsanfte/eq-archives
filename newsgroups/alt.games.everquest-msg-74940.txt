Any geforce 2 64 meg is going to be pretty fine, you don't really need
a geforce 3 if you can't afford it (though I guess they are around 200
now?) Really the faster geforce 2's don't cost much more than an MX
geforce 2 now do they?

Not a significant difference, no. Will it run better? yes probably
especially in areas with lots of textures such as trees or something.

Play in 800 x 600 full screen. It isn't like before, the dx8 engine
upgrade slowed down performance a ton. Course I've always played at
800 x 600 so even when I upgrade I will, its fine.

Another huge boost is setting textures in options to LOW. This saves a
ton of memory use.

Really 512 meg ram is fine and you could probably use conservative
swap and run pretty well. Your cpu is still more than good enough.
Biggest bottleneck is your graphics card. Is your system even an AGP
one???? 

A 512 meg limitation on an agp system board sounds odd unless you
maybe have an AGP 1 x board or the first 2 x. I have an asus p2b board
in mine which has a bios limitation of like 1.5 gig but the
unfortunate thing is that since it only has 3 dimm slots and the dimm
slots can only read up to 256 meg dimms I have a hard limitation of
768 megs of system ram. Do you know if your limitation is a bios one
that could be upgraded or one like mine? When I first got this mboard
the limitation was lower I'm pretty sure as was my cpu limitation, now
its higher.

So, If I was you and my board WAS at least 2x agp I'd get a good
geforce 64 meg something .. an MX or above (up to the cheaper geforce
3s) If you were really itching to get more ram, the next cheapest
upgrade would be to buy a motherboard that can use your existing cpu
and all the stuff you have including the type of ram you have but has
a standard memory limitation of today like 2 gig or whatever (and
plenty of dimm slots) A motherboard like that is probably under 120
bucks. The nice thing is such a newer Mboard would probably be 4x agp
also and make for a faster system in general.
