You'll need two rods to do this, one full and one empty.  Sell the full
one, sell the empty one (it will "stack" with the full one in the
merchant's inventory and be recharged), then buy them both back.

As far as I know, this is one of those things Verant looks the other way
on, like multiquesting.  The don't condone it, and if you screw up and lose
your items you're on your own, but it's just too useful as a money sink
to fix it.
