At most I put one point into baking to begin with.  I started with fish
rolls, went all the way to 135 with the fish rolls, not attempting any other
baking.  Your INT will not affect your success rate, just your skill
increase rate.  My WIS was 140ish when I did my baking, so skill increases
were not as common for me as for you, hence many more attempts, and as
success rate is strictly based on skill level vs trivial level, I got many
more fish rolls out of it.  I could be off on the number of attempts,
perhaps it was more, but I am fairly certain that my overall success rate
byt the time I hit 135 was around 20 percent or so, mostly from the later
attempts of course.
