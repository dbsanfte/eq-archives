Autosplit is a crock... people shouldn't use it, because the looter is
unfairly making a lot more money than anybody else, whilst giving the
impression he's trying to be nice and generous and sharing

Since the posts on here, I made myself a macro for -
attack off, pick pocket, *sense trap, hide, attack on     (I change it at
random from sense to disarm trap)

Fighting in JP (im sure there are no traps there!) I get skillups every now
and then,  46 now.. and skills are something like
Archery:96
Pickpocket: 160
Backstab: 170
Sense trap:50
Disarm trap:5
Disarm:0
Instill Doubt:0

Well with parents out of the equation, I can use other methods of bribery to
get her to do it.. /nod

I think for Lockpick, Im just gonna pump training points into it.. it gets
hella expensive, so I'll set a limit of i dunno, 10k, and see what kinda
skill I get from it.

Whats the max on it?  And whats the general thoughts of poison?  My guildie
rogues seem to think its a pointless waste of time.  A 60 rogue trying to
get Half elf mask linked me their trohpy for it tho: stats are pretty nice

Quiet is good..  I have many many channels already, but thankfully most are
fairly quiet (8 channels, pretty much all I couldn't /leave for any period
of time)

> Because if nobody else is, I pull the aggro.  And when I pull, I hate it

If you've got a ranger using snare to pull, an arrow isn't gonna take agro.
And besides, doing 4 damage won't take much taunting for the MA to agro :)

Why so fussy?

Magicians are your friend

I saw a tolans for 20k in the bazaar last night... guildie ranger was in
howls of laughter when I checked the price with him.
Anyway, fletching components are useless if i don't skill up, right?
Thought so.. f that.  I don't do trade skills sorry !

> Here and there.  Slowest damn skill I've ever had to raise.  Worse than
> ID :p

I worked so hard to raise ID on my monk... I didn't use it in groups, cuz
well, its rude (only person I really ever kicked out my group.. in DL, he
feared the mob.. we said don't use ID.. he did it again.. we say dont use ID
damnit.. he fears it again.. disband)

I was actually on a velk raid when I got (200), so i was already lvl 60..
and even with an ensnare item, I find ID totally useless (in like every
expansion)

So yeah, im not even gonna try and raise my rogues.  Same for disarm... the
only time I ever use it is in the arena, and I duel so little (last night
was like the first time this year)

As for the lil assling..  since he dinged 46, most spells now work :)  yay
for avatar!  All stats maxed, and over 1200 ATK.. its sick :)

He went on his first raid too last night, im gonna do Bracer of Benevolence
quest for them, the easy faction way.

Took him and my girlfs ranger to Kael for AoW.. faction on Vindi, Statue,
AoW, and most of the guards inbetween.. less than an hours work and im sure
it pushed my CoV faction pretty damn high.

My group thought it hillarious to see a level 41 and 46 beating on AoW
(especially as they werent shrunk, unlike the majority of the raid)  for
some reason my BS's were pretty shitty tho :(
