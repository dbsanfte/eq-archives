Seems to me I remember doing a quest or two in Erudin with the Peacekeepers
a long while back and when getting faction it read...

Peacekeepers got better
Heretics got worse
Heretics got worse

at the time I thought nothing more than a double hit.... maybe there are two
factions there that are heretics.

Someone please fill me in a bit on this True Spirit faction too.  Thanks
