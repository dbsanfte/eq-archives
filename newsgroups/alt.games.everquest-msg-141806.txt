I guess it depends on the guild/people doing it.  Last time I did a manor
farming session and let random people come, I had a channel called
(something like) tweekasux..  tweeka obviously being one of my friends there
:)

A well balanced group of 60's wouldn't choke on Prots (PoZ as you call
them).

When i was in my arena farming stage (I exped there pretty much every day
for a few weeks straight), there was "me" 60monk, 60 cleric, 60 shaman, and
a friend, 60 monk.

So 4 characters (albeit 3 ran by me) and we could keep the entire "outside"
clear, and the 3 Prots inside the door, and the 2 named down each ramp in
there (where Vealok the angry spawns, and the Gladiator, and
xxx_cold_whatever pops)

Being monks we rarely double pulled.. maybe twice in the course of the day..
but the double pulls (its a weird bug) were always Vealok the angry, and a
Prot.   We often had a mob pop on us while in battle, but we never once
wiped there.

haha. the same bastages who've done PoF twice since saturday, and both have
resulted in a c.r.

i got home saturday and logged on (pretty drunk.. well a lot drunk) and in
thinking the broken golem was up (a guildies last epic part) had took a few
groups to check it out.

they brutally mass wiped, they tried to break it naked and died again, and
again... a shitload of unrezzable corpses etc.  i got with 5 others (all
dressed and alive) and we broke pof. I was informed id logged on something
like 5 hours after the CR started.  ouch.

Last night, this time the golem was up.  Sat at the portal as everybody
buffed, my cable modem died.  10 mins later I get back on..  they had wiped
again lol.  They had taken several low level people in with them (from a
guild that was forming for pof when we moved in) so I think that was a key
reason this time... but even so!

 We managed to scrape a group together of people that were still dressed (it
was an aborted break-in so some (very few) had managed to gate/evac) and we
did a ww break in again and rezzed them all in.   Wasn't bad like Saturday..
but I get the feeling we won't be hitting Cazic again anytime soon :p

I did kael bank every day for a week, with *zero* loot drops.  One day a
shaman friend was passing through the bank 10 mins after id left, and saw a
luitenant.  He solod him.. leather fucking BP!  /sigh   (This was about 4
months before I finally got one to drop.. about 8 months after id started
for one)
