Not really.

STR affects the MAXIMUM hit, but you hit for the max such a small percentage
of the time that the overall effect on your total damage output is almost
nil.

Most of the time, you will hit for Weapon Damage*2 + Bonus.

If you do a histogram of your damage output, it'll be a bell curve with its
peak at that point.  Increasing your STR will pull the trailing edge of that
bell curve out a tiny bit - that's all.  The peak will still be in the same
place, and the edges will still taper off at the same rate, but with more
STR, one edge will go out a tad farther.
