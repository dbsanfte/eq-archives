Basic lesson from this experience, DO NOT USE MERCHANTS.  Don't buy
weapons/armor from them and don't sell anything to them until you are
certain it is worthless to other players.  You won't even get a 10th of the
actual value from a merchant.  I buy food, reagents, and bandaids from
merchants and sell jewels to them, that's basically about it.  Oh, and the
brigandine armor that drops in Paludal, I sell that as well.  :)
