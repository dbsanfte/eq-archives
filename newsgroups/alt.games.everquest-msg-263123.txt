Agreed - at the very high end. My point was the author was correct in 
their assertion of the four primary necessar archetypes for the most 
part. Buffing/debuffing (to include slowing) might be considered for a 
fifth archetype, but my feeling was that it wouldn't stand on it's own 
too well and may be better suited to be covered by one of the other four 
archetypes.

It's been *my* experience, anyway. Personally, I think it may be largely 
due to word of mouth chicken little syndrome, but that's something I 
haven't noticed with the ranger class, for example. /shrug

Agreed. I've always felt that SK's and Paladins certainly have some extra 
tools at their disposal there, but not such that they become the obvious 
choice, relegating warriors to second-class alternatives. I'm of the 
opinion that if a person is dead set on one over the other for their 
tank, then they're likely being a bit close-minded.
