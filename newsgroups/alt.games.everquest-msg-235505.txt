Oh yes, it was definitely a waste to set up a server that routinely
has a higher player population than a fair number of much older
servers.  I mean, how fucking stupid can SOE be, actually doing
something that isn't obviously pandering to the fraction of the
player base at the "highend".  How dare they have done something
that brought a lot of fun back to the game for a few thousand bored
non-raiders on the verge of quitting (or already gone, quite a few
of the folks I played with on Stromm _returned_ to EQ solely because
of Stromm).  Curse those evil corporate bastards at SOE for having
once actually done something different.  We want more endless
timesinks, we want every uberguilder in the game to be able to swat
Gorenaire in a matter of seconds with his "Uberpecker of Virtual 
Dickwaving", the people have spoken!
