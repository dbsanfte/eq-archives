Is choppy sound just stuttery sound, or is it delayed too? You
might like to have a play with the PCI latency setting on the SB Live's
IRQ; it's a very process-intensive card and likes to do a lot with its 
timeslices, but it can't (they are pre-empted by the motherboard), so it
gets interrupted. You need to alter the latency so it gets more time.

Search Google for some (free) downloads that you can use to experiment
with the PCI latency.
