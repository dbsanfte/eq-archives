There's a lot of misinformation about this going around.  I've heard tons of
people claim someone couldn't group with them because of the level limit,
when actually they could.  The actual formula is as follows.

Take the level of the lowest character and divide by two, round up to the
nearest whole number.  If the result is less than five, use five.  Add this
number to the level of the lowest character (the number you started with).
The resulting number is the highest level that that character can group with
and get XP.

Some examples:

A Level 3 Character -> 3 divided by 2 is 1.5, round up to 2.  2 is less than
5, using 5 instead.  3 plus 5 is 8.  A level 3 character can group with up
to a level 8 character and still get XP.

A Level 20 Character -> 20 divided by 2 is 10, no need to round.  10 is not
less than 5.  20 plus 10 is 30.  A level 20 character can group with up to a
level 30 character and still get XP.

A Level 29 Character -> 29 divided by 2 is 14.5, round up to 15.  15 is not
less than 5.  29 plus 15 is 44.  A level 29 character can group with up to a
level 44 character and still get XP.
