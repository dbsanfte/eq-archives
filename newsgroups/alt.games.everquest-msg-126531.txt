Rogues are, IMO, the hardest class to work into a duo or small group
with just casters. (By that, I mean offensive casters, such as wizards,
necros and magicians). 

The only way I found to work my wizard with a rogue was aggro kiting,
and if you've ever tried it you'll likely know that it's not very
efficient. And the rogue would STILL draw aggro too often because
backstab is such a huge taunt. Plus, trying to BS and do rogue work on a
mob that's moving, even if snared, is a LOT harder on the rogue than a
stationary mob. Throw in no healer in group, and you've got a recipie
for very slow xp, too much downtime, and one bored necro.
