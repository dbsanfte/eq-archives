Spells that can only be sourced from dropping off monsters seem very
rare indeed :(

Having hit 49 with my druid I tried to get the L48 spell "healing
waters" that needs to be quested by getting two items off two mobs in
dulak harbour.

So I found a good spot where I could pull them and proceeded to kill
them, over and over, till I hit level 50. I would have killed about 40
of them and not even a single piece of the two pieces I needed
dropped. At this rate I would hit level 51 before I got the items and
not even need the spell.

So I gave that up and went the wyrm caves in GD to try and get the L50
spell improved superior camouflage. So I camped there and killed about
15 of the mobs that drop it and got nothing. I then unfortunately died
by being hit by 4 ancient and elder wyrms that were totally invisible
(I was dead in three hits, log showed four of them attacking me, but
there was -nothing- in cave with me lol)

How are you supposed to get spells that drop off monsters ? Seems the
drop rate must be %1 - %2, at this rate you'll be up to the next spell
level and not even need it.

Cheers,
