When my Paladin is main tanking, I like to set the habit that, after the
main target is dead, I will select the next target by rooting him.  This has
the effect of making a nice taunt, and if there's still alot of hate on the
caster or priest, I'll have a while to beat on him to redirect aggro.  What
it also does (which is why the 'chanters I've grouped with like it), is
keeps everyone from picking a different mezzed target after the main one's
down.  Saves the 'chanter a bit of mana in re-mezzing, after everyone
finally decides to assist me.

When I'm not the main tank, I have my assist key hardwired to the main tank,
and use that instead of the autotarget key.
