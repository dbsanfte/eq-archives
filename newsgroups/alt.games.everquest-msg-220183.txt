it wouldn't make much sense to base in-game seasons off of RL reasons in the
northern hemisphere

lots of people in the other ..hmm...HALF of the world might be less-immersed
=P

plus the 3 months of a RL season = several years in-game anyway


the geometry of eq has been petty for a long time (still is) ....our
characters can be unique, isn't that enough?

it's still the best game ever =)
