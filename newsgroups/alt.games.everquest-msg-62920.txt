Well, actually, sometimes they do.  My neice started my druid.  I didn't like
the name she chose.  But I didn't want to start a new one.
I did the honorable thing:  I waited til VERY late at night, when things were
slow.  Then I begged the GM in a short but eloquent statement about how sorry I
was for my lack of foresight when choosing a name.  And was very, very nice. 
And patient.  It took over an hour, but they DID change her name.
