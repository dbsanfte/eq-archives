Its new by that definition. Over a  year old, but not "always been that 
way."

Previously, your mana regen rate was better sitting than it was 
standing, but it was what it was.  They added in the concept of out of 
combat regen rates, which are not only much higher than the old ones, 
but also ignore your regen rate completely, making a mockery of FT and 
HP regen.  Some mobs are tagged "raid", meaning its 5 minutes after 
killing one before  you can get that 3% per tic rate, even though they 
may be soloable by a reasonably geared level 60.  Others are tagged 
regular even though it may take more than one group of level 70s to take 
them down, 30 seconds later you're in full regen mode.
