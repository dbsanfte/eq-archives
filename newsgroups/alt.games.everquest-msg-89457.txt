Better idea: hang on to foraged rabbit meat and vegies, and get a pot
(either pottery or smithing, or commission someone to make it for
you).
Rabbit stew is one rabbit meat and a flask of water in a pot, and
vegetable soup is one vegetable, flask of water and jug of sauces in a
pot. Both are hearty meals that are trivial at 68 and you get half the
ingredients for free.
