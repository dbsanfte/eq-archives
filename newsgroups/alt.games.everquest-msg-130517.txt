Haha, nope, no actual port, was just curious.  Aye, I know about guild
leadership.  I am the leader of Keepers of Knowledge, a guild on TM.
Started it about 2 years ago, actually, more than that, with 4 of my friends
I went to high school with at the time.  We were all ex-pats going to an
international school in London, England.  Well, being an ex-pat, lots of
moving and everything, my 4 main officers always got on at different times,
so guild meetings were harder to set up, etc.  Well, brit lore invited us
all to join them.  I told my friends that there would be no hard feelings if
they wanted to take the offer, as, britannic lore is a bigger guild, much
better organized (well, they were back then, at least *wink*), and they
could do a lot more than we could.  I stuck with KoK because.. well, I felt
like a father. They all went off and became super uber.  We have enough
players in the guild to keep it from going under when they check for 10
members.. mainly because everyone I know has an alt that they never play in
it.  I'm a full time college student and a work a lot of hours as well, so I
don't have nearly the time I wish I could give to the guild.  Anyways, thats
my sob story.. i remember the days when I could get on and see bright green
guild chat flying by, and actually having to turn it off cause there was so
much of it.. now I see that color and my eyes widen and I try to figure out
who's alt is on for a transfer =0P.  Actually, in the last month or so, we
have started growing again.  Anyways, everyone knows everyone, so thats
nice, at least.
