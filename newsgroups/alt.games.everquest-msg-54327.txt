Point of fact, the net was originally designed for the transfer of
information (the web is a relative newcomer to the original arpanet), a
category which EQ falls into.  Of course that adds nothing to the satellite
discussion just thought I would troll for a sec.  Advice from people I know
who do it though... stay far away from satellite and stay with dial up.  You
may want to check for the possibility of "affordable ISDN" which is
available almost everywhere.  I have a friend in Mississippi rural who pays
about 90$ a month for dual ISDN (128k) and she is very happy with it and EQ,
depends on your level of addiction I suppose.
