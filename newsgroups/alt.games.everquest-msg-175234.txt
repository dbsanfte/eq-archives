Feel out a couple different servers before deciding on a permanent home.  I
messed around on Vazaelle for about 4-5 months, as my friends were playing
there and hailed it as the greatest server in all Sonyland.  Sadly mistaken
they were, I was constantly KS'd, begged from, hassled for buffs, ports, and
anything else I could possibly give for free.  At first I did it all the
time, then I noticed a pattern ... everyone else was gaining levels, money,
groups ... I was still the same level with NO xp gain in 3 weeks.  I retired
my druid at 42nd level, and started a warrior thinking .. "Heh! beg buffs,
ports, and healing from me now!!" And STILL constant begging, and
harrassment.  I am, of course, making it seem like a bad server for
mid-levels, but I cannot honestly recall having any fun on there after I hit
39th lvl ... there were a few other servers like that as well.

My personal favorites are: E'Ci, Bristlebane, The Rathe(these people are
just TO nice to believe).

E'Ci = hardly any lower levels ... this is my 'soloing' character server.

Bristlebane - lots of low, mid, high levels everywhere, people are generally
very nice to newbies IF asking properly for help.

The Rathe = omg! The people I came across in my toons life on this server
are like Mary Poppins.  VERY willing to help if asked nicely, VERY friendly,
I just cant say enough about how nice my time was on this server ... and I
only ever made it to 19th lvl!!! lol


afaik, these servers are all 'old-school' servers, with alot of long-time
players on it .. it is a refreshing thing to see 90% of them remembering
that we all came from the same 'click' =)

I hardly ever answer any posts here, but I never ignore any of them either
=) Well ... there are a few that have made the Plonk Hall of Fame.

Cheers, and good luck to you on your return :)
