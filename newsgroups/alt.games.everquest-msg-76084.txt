Recomendation:

You're a tank. You take damamge.

If you trade 1 point of ac for 10 points of dex, you are doing yourself
a disservice. I forget the exact figures, but dex has a miniscule effect
on procs. If your AC if comparable to the mob's hidden ATK value (eg:
most exp group mobs), every point counts. You should get your dex over
100 to avoid the penalty, but NOT at the expense of AC. One more proc
every so often will not improve your warrior abilities more than the
slight extra damage you'll be taking.

Certainly, for a point here, or a point there, it's really not that
important. But if it's extendedto a significant dex gain at the expense
of AC, you WILL suffer in your tanking abilities.

AC first
Stam/hps second
Everything else a distant third
