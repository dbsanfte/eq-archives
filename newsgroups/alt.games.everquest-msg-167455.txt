255 is the max. Before level 25or so, you may be better of on 
concentrating on plus mana items &/or plus hit point items. After 40, 
you want things that are plus int, mana AND HP- and saves too.

It ALL needs to go into the same directory. RE-install POP in the proper 
directory.

Make sure you have spell messages turned on in the options. Also, some 
DOTs don't have a DD component and others do- only those with a DD 
component should tell you "Target was hit for X damage" - all other DOTs 
tell you effects, like "Target looks weaker".
