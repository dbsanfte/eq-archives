Haven't been in the caves in at least a month, mayhap they raised the 
drop rate.  Last time I was there, my group was killing owlbears for 3 
hours and only got 2 pelts, we had a full group so 4 of us went away 
with out one that day.  Increased drop rate in the moor don't do you any 
good when the grimling control the place...like they usually do whenever 
I need to go there.  Had to kill cubs for a drop that only drops there, 
took me over a week because whenever I logged in there were grimlings as 
far as the eye could see.  Grr, sometimes being a vahshir is a pain if 
you wanna do the class quests.
