Suddenly the penny dropped that we'd been slacking on the old Velious
lands since Luclin came out, and we'd almost forgotten we had unfinished
business there...

FRIDAY:
With the Luclin expansion, we didn't need Kael as a base any more, so
with the obstacle of faction removed, King Tormax went from benevolent
ruler, to yet another 'INC!' target. He'd been done several times by
other guilds on our server, so we calmly added our name to that list and
dispatched him easily on our first attempt.

SATURDAY:
We got into Plane of Growth early, and began trashing everything that
moved. As our numbers swelled we split into 2 raids and executed a
pincer movement on the entire zone. Once most was dead, we rejoined, and
laid waste to the remaining nameds without problems. Then came Tunare's
tree. Hmmm... those panthers really put a dent in our day. AE silence +
AE damage = not fun. Prince decided to pick a fight, but our titled army
soon dethroned him in a coup d'etat. He dropped a couple of flutes. This
one time....at band camp... Then those brownies... ewwww... Smaller than
your thumb, but with more hps than Mr. T it seemed. Talk about a long
boring fight, LOL. They eventaully went the same way as all the others
though. Then it was time for Tunare herself, Mother of All. Annoying is
how I'd describe the fight, hard to get close enough to hit, even when
you weren't rooted out of range. And that regen of hers is icky. Oh
well, eventually she made the ultimate sacrifice to her trees, and
became fertiliser. She was generous with her loot too - 3 of those FT5
shields ):oD

Killed on our first ever attempt, and a server first to boot.

SUNDAY:
Hmmm... nothing up (:o(
Day of rest

MONDAY
Statue popped!
So, back to Kael we go to settle an old, old, score. We'd tried the AoW
months and months ago in the early days of Velious. I'll be frank, we
got our asses handed to us on a silver platter, hehe. Now was the time
for revenge. Vindi was pulled and fell without a single death. All was
looking good. Now, we have usually avoided a CH rotation up until this
point, preferring to trust our clerics. This has worked fine for us, but
the sheer amount of damage the AoW puts out made us decide to change our
plans an go for an enforced rotation. Using a completely new strat to us
was a risky business on a fight where one mistake spelt disaster, and
with the AoW's despawn rate, we'd not have time for a second chance. So,
we decided to 'practice' on the Statue. Here's the kicker though, we
decided not to use defensive on the MT, and not to slow the Statue, to
get a more 'realistic' feel. LOL! That hurt! 2 attempts to refine
strategy, deliberately camping/dying after enrage, and we were ready for
the big cheese himself. Slap! Bang! Wallop! and the Avatar of War lay
dead at our feet with a couple of rings and a mask.

Killed on our first attempt in months, and another server first.

WHAT A WEEKEND hehe. 

Add Zeb to the list of servers with a complete tick-box for Velious mobs
):oD
