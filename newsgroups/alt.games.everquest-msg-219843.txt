Oh, heh, I do...it's not that I'm looking for the enrage message instead,
it's that I'm looking at positioning or a tell or group speak or anything
other than what I *should* be looking at. Mind you, I'm speaking of
fighting undead in Nadox...some of which enrage, some of which don't...and
while you can figure out which ones enrage by their name (sodden crewmen),
they all start to look the same and you are getting sleepy after three
hours of farming that damned necklace and rakyn just pulled 2 more fun and
OH SHIT ENRAGE I"M IN THE MIDDLE OF TYPING AN IMPORTANT TELL! :P
