What you need to do (and this will be hard) is automate the content
creation.  Have something like an RTS game running, but played by computer
(with guidance perhaps from GMs).  That determines things like where cities
are built, what groups of mobs end up in conflict (and hence the faction
system), and so on.  Basically, a simulation at an abstract level of a
world.  The MMORPG software monitors that, and spawns mobs, and even creates
cities, accordingly, and assigns factions based on the conflicts from the
RTS.

Things that happen in the MMORPG would have to feed back to the RTS, so if
the MMORPG server notices that a particular camp of Orcs is being wiped out
a lot, you'd have the program playing the RTS move them, and that would then
disturb things like resource allocation and interracial relations and stuff
like that, which would be simulated in the RTS and then reflected back in
the MMORPG.

Within and near cities, you have to have some good NPC AI running that gives
each NPC goals (think something like "Black & White"...), and from that you
can automatically generate some quests.  As people complete these quests,
the NPCs goals might change.
