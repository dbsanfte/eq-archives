Seriously Jazz, if you can't find the memory cheaper, you could get yourself
into a P3-800 or P3-1GHz with 512mb of 133MHz SRAM for about the same price
as that damned IBM memory.  I did a quick check at the place I buy from,
www.dreamtech.com, and they had the ram for $39 for 256MB (You can find it
cheaper), and a barebones P3-800 for $289.  for the barebones P3-1GHz, was
$359.  Their system has built in sound, VIA chipset (when I bought one),
nothing to write home about, but it works, here are the specs:

With Pentium� III Processor

. Intel Pentium III� Processor
. Configurable Plug-n-Play BIOS
. Advanced Power Management
. Supports RAM up to 768MB
. 1.44MB 3.5" Floppy Disk Drive
. UDMA 4 Hard Drive Controller
. 5 32-bit PCI, 1 ISA, & 1 AGP slot
. 2 Floppy Drive Controller
. 2 16550 Serial Ports
. 1 Parallel Port, 2 USB & PS/2 port
. Professional ATX Tower Case
. 250 WATT ATX Power Supply
. 104-Key PS/2 keyboard
. Yamaha Sound System


You would have to get a video card, preferably AGP, and you'd be set to play
EQ.  I'm sure you can find cheaper out there, I like them, I've dealt with
them off and on for a few years, and they've been good about delivery,
answering questions and such.
