I like Enchanter paired with a Ranger. Mezzes in tough zones help a
lot. Sow and Snare makes life easy for fear kiting. For normal arrow
kiting, mezzes keep the adds managed, and stun and roots help when we
get in close. The ranger supplies some heals and the Enchanter
breezes/clars.

The only thing I like to add is a wizzy to add DD and AOE DD
firepower.
