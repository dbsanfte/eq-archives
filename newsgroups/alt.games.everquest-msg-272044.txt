Um, sorry, but that one seems pretty obvious to me. Even if it weren't
so for you, it wouldn't take much playing or web browsing for it to
become clear enough without your even trying.

Honestly, I think you're just asking too much. You choose not to
experience a certain aspect of the game, yet think the FAQ should be
updated to offer the information you miss out on (temporarily) by doing 
so.

Then there is no need to ask at that point.

Describing the many various possible playstyles certainly goes beyond
the scope of the typical FAQ.
