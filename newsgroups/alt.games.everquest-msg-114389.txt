Because, he's saying that the enchanter does the same amount of work as the
tanks (probably more, since tanking isn't quite as challenging as playing an
enchanter), provides every bit as necessary of a service, but gets passed up
by the merit based loot system.

Some may say that "it's not about the loot, it's about the guild..."
Bullscheist.  If it wasn't about the loot, most of those raids would never
happen.  If it wasn't about the loot, then it wouldn't be bad to throw the
enchante a bone now and then, right?
