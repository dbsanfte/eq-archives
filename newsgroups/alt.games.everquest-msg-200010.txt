What video card are you using? I've been using DX9 for months, and EQ is
fine. It should *never* matter if you install a higher level of DirectX than
is required. Because of the way DirectX is designed, if a program uses
Direct 8, thats what it'll use - even if you have DirectX 14 installed.

Now, thats what *should* happen, but in reality thats not always the case,
as you can see. :) I'd try to contact both your video card manufacturer and
Microsoft, and see what they say. It could very well be that EQ is doing
something silly, it wouldnt be the first time...

Oh yeah, are you running windowed or fullscreen? Seems like I remember
hearing about gamma troubles when using windowed, I think. Something like
its forced to use Window's gamma settings in windowed mode. In fact, I just
tried, and in windowed mode the gamma slider does nothing...
