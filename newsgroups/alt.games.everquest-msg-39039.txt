Sounds like the Drakkel Icegrinder.
I would say around 200pp on the Veeshan server. The stats arent that good, but the
proc start at level 1 making it a brilliant twink weapon (my troll used it for the
first 8 levels, stopped due to being too stupid to raise 2hb fast enough).
Not many people see the potential of the Icegrinder as a twink weapon, so the price
are WAY down.
