I think DAoC had one of the crafting systems (enchanting?) where you 
could 'push' your results... saw a friend go boom and die. Don't know if 
he was low hp or what though. 'Routinely kills' is a bit much I think.

I like Final Fantasy's quests. Some are singles, some are repeats. Some 
of the repeats are really tough, some give crap rewards.

My main problem with FF... it's locking mechanism hasn't made the player 
base any more social or polite. In fact it (like all games I've played 
since EQ) seems to have more rude and cheap players than I ever remember 
running into in EQ. Let me give you two examples: There are big threads 
on several class related boards about how certain classes that are 
nominally good pullers are ineffective because they don't come with some 
insta-use skill that can gain agro, like warrior's provoke, the serveral 
insta cast mage spells, thief's steal, etc. Second example: For the 
ranger class flag quest, I had to go to a somewhat dangerous zone, get 
past a bunch of even con tigers, and watch a 'too weak' con (green) 'old 
tiger' die naturally (he spawns, his health goes down, and in about 3 
min he dies.) He is his own spawn (not a placeholder) and spawns every 
10 min or so. Too anyone that can kill the tigers, he doesn't give xp, 
but will link (help the other tigers) if you are fighting tigers near 
him. I spent 2 hours one night trying to do this quest because the red 
mage soloing there (15 levels higher than I was) kept slaughtering the 
old tiger (he must die naturally) reason? "ranjors suk".

So I logged there, logged in the next day and did it, but shit like this 
goes on all the time. Mind you, there are some great people around, but 
I seem to run into the rotten apples a lot more.

I'm not a big fan of this kind of thing either, but it will be ok I guess.

One of the things I like about Final Fantasy is here too.. Travel is a 
bitch. At level 1 you can walk or ride the one boat as a shortcut 
between two of the cities. By making trips to forts you can earn the 
right to port around the world some, but it's expensive.  The pc cast 
ports can only be accessed if you go to the port destination first and 
get a 'telepoint crystal'. Around level 20 you can do a quest that will 
essentially give you a horse to ride for 20 min, but that costs money 
too. By completeing missions (sequential sets of quests) you can get an 
airship pass, which will let you get from any city to any city in about 
20 min (10 min max wait and ride time, and you have to go through the 
central city of Jeuno).

My friend in beta is wearing almost exculsivly crafted, he says there is

I would like something less intrusive loot system I guess, but I like it 
better than WoW's auto 'you get to loot now'. The quest thing gives you 
reason to check things out. I like the lotto system in Final fantasy: 
you can roll on it now, or later, or eventually it auto lottos it (but 
if at least one person rolls, everyone who wants it has to roll.)
