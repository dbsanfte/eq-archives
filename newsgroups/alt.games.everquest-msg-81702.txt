    This is server specific, then. On my server (Quellious), you almost
never see a master looter. The standard is usually FFA, with everyone giving
their first non-rollable gem (so no Blue Diamonds or Diamonds) to the
cleric. With typical group membership flux that's more than adequate.

    Of course there is. Smart groups that want an "all gems to cleric"
system give all actual gems to cleric, and alpha the jewelcraft items (Ruby
Crown, Mithril Amulet etc.) and the Jacinths and Black Sapphires. Between
getting the expensive jewelry and being able to loot PP, everyone should get
money then.

    Of course. Tons of gems and jewelry drop if you're there for long
enough. Not to mention the sellable items, which can still fetch good
prices.

    Is that similar to the "get rich quick" scheme that tanks use of making
any camp where no caster loot drops NBG? "Only those that will use the Lammy
can roll on it." Ok, so whoever wins the Lammy will let the rest of the
group roll on whatever the Lammy replaced, right, so EVERYONE there has a
chance at improving themselves? No?

    If you don't like the fact that one class does better than you in one
zone in the game, then don't go to that zone. You don't hear the clerics
whining about there being almost no gem drops in Velk's spider areas, do
you? Or absolutely no gems in the XP regions of Sol B? Or any of the other
zones that aren't Sebilis? Yet I hear that clerics <gasp> cast symbol in
those zones, too! The injustice!

    Filling your packs with spells is a sign of a REALLY poverty-stricken
cleric. Seriously. Or one that has friends/twinks/guildmates that need
spells badly. If you're looting all the jewelcraft items (as you suggest)
you just don't have space for 15 pp non-stacking items.

>  Even if its just 500pp max, thats 1kpp PROFIT every 2 days,

    For every day you get a group, the group stays together for long enough,
and the group agrees to split money the way you describe. I can't begin to
count from my Sebilis days (55-59) how many times the group would (a) split
up shortly after everyone was Symboled or (b) would make statements like
"The cleric's job is to make sure we're symboled, that's a cost they have to
bear. Oh, and our Crypt group will be NBG, everyone roll on Heiro cloak."
You also forget that 'Shroom camps like King and areas like Crypt don't have
the gem drops the rest of the dungeon has, and clerics lose money there.

    Please - go NBG in Nec/Guard, or Disco, or Crypt, and sell the monk
weapon drops. You'll do fine.

    I never made cash in Sebilis until they made the Necrosis-area scarabs
always drop a planar gem table loot. Then I made some cash. You might be
surprised how stingy some groups are on other servers, and how many peridots
a sub-Naltron's Mark cleric can go through.
