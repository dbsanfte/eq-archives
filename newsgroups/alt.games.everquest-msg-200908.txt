You're looking at this from the wrong angle. What people are complaining
about is that inexperienced players are far more likely to learn easy, but
really bad, techniques that work only because they have KEI, rather than
harder but better skills that will work even without it. You know, enchanters
that don't learn crowd control skills because, with KEI, even their lame
nukes and dots are "good enough". And worse, because of inexperience,
are more likely to misdiagnose any problems as "the game is unplayable
if everyone in the group doesn't have KEI" rather than "wow, I spent
30 levels learning all really sucky techniques".

... and they still won't learn it! You think a newb KEI'd druid is going to
sit around for 2 minutes at FH/FM waiting for a mob to rot? No way! They'll
root, drop every dot they have on it, and chain nuke it to death. All in
30 seconds or so. And finish at 80m. So what if it's inefficient? Thanks
to KEI, he might not ever notice! Think he'll learn how important it is
to rot them in a secluded area so you don't get social adds? Nope, that's
a *feature* for the KEI'd newb so he doesn't have to waste time pulling,
because he's *always* ready for more!

Wizards with KEI don't have to learn the difference between big nukes
and mana efficient nukes, because with KEI *every* nuke is mana efficient
enough.

No one needs to learn aggro management if the cleric has KEI, because
the cleric's got so much mana, he can melee, nuke, *and* keep everyone
healed no matter how -- or even *if* -- there's any crowd control. With
*no* downtime. Woot!


No one is claiming KEI makes it impossible for players to learn the correct
class skills, they're claiming than inexperienced players have no need to
learn the correct class skills, because KEI turns really bad techniques
into adequate ones. Yes, an expert level 12 shaman with KEI can find really
challenging hunting grounds to push his limits if he chooses to. But a newb
level 12 shaman with KEI gets "good enough" xp and loot farming a_burly_gnoll
in blackburrow, in perfect safety, all the while learning that mana and
aggro management isn't important. This is a good thing?
