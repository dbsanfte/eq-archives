Befor this lovely new expansion came out, I remember quite clearly what
Absor said.

"We know what we are doing".  -Absor

ok.

Sue me for being Chicken Little where expansions & SOE is concerned.

I'm only logging ON on Friday to do my VOX/Naggy Epic raids in anycase.

I won't consider buying the expansion until it's LIVE for at least 60 days.

After Prexus I wanna watch what happens to the SOE Server Farms.

Btw, I getting Homeworld 2.

Homeworld 2 is going to be intresting & watching SOE have it's usuall pity
party should be intresting. I win both ways.

I preordered Homeworld 2 at my local EB and guess what? My system didn't
blow up!

Enjoy!
