approximately 20 khp or so by my estimate.

at 53 it's probably going to take you about 45 minutes to kill one depending
on gear, if you have KEI, it'll be a lot faster (like 20 minutes).  Keep in
mind that it doesn't matter whether your target is an even con level 53
Elysian, or a red con level 57 elysian, the hp difference is about 300 hp
between the two, the only difference is how much of root resists you get,
and with the new dot kiting de-nerf, that's not a big deal.

I personally only did them with KEI until now because of the speed factor,
but I went ahead and tried it without, mostly to see if I could, and it
wasn't hard at all, though I did notice that the dot kiting denef helped
immensely since they break root about every 3 seconds (you'll get one or two
roots that will stick for full every combat, use them to meditate)

Ensnare, Winged Death, Grasping roots (level 5 root) and Drones of Doom off
of ES arms/velious bracer are the only offensive spells you should be using.
Epic if you have it though, I don't.

I've been soloing them since 53, though I didn't do without KEI until 55
(at 54 you get 2 mana/tick wolf form, stacks with KEI, and at 53 I got my
FT1 solstice earring also)

Personally, besides looting my BP and legs, the best part of killing
elysians is the "Disturbed Elysian Remains becomes ENRAGED!" message.
Hmm... autoriposte on... nothing?  effective....
