I've opted for the new UI and I like it much better. The gripe about the 
horizontal hotkeys is easily fixed by using hotkeys #3 and 4 Then 
reassigning the keys associated with Hotkeys 1 and 2 to the new banks. This 
then gives me 20 vertical hotkeys as opposed to 10 on the old UI. As far as 
the spell buffs go I like the smaller icons. I can set up a 3x5 window for 
buffs in a much smaller screen space than I could with the old UI. And the 
learning all the new spell icons, come on now, most people have the same 
buffs on most of the time. It takes about 2 rounds of play to learn the new 
icons.
