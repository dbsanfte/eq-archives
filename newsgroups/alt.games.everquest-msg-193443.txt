The problem is that their are 3 catagories of game that are being
talked about.
1 is the Online ONLY type game like EQ and such. Where you can only
play the game online and their is no single player game.

2 is the Single Player game that has a Mulitplayer option that allows
you to play the "exact" same game on a LAN or online against others,
i.e. Starcraft, Warcraft, etc.

3 is the Sinlge Player game that allows you play on a LAN or online
but not the actually game, like Halflife , Quake, where you can play
against other in Deathmatch and such but not acutally play the "game".

But I (keyword " I " ) do not believe that most people buy the game
for the online option only. I believe people buy the game for the
single play and then once that is done, then they go to multiplayer
mode because thats all they have left to get their money's worth out
of the game.
