Also tried it, found the gameplay uninteresting compared to classic EQ
and technically an immense  resource hog compared to EQ, WoW or EQ2
even.

Turned down most of the options and got it running passably well but
looking like crap (this was beta 5).  I hear it's much improved
technically since release but as much as it pains me to say it I
couldn't recommend it to the casual player over WoW.
