    Cats in Hats are morons. There's a nice thread on FoH's site where
Seethur tried to get people outraged at the GMs over what happened to you,
but instead got everyone firmly against his guild's cheeseball tactics.

    Heh, nice one! I hadn't read about them breaking mez - figures they
would.

    If you get enough petitions in the queue, a GM SWAT team is sent in to
clear the queue down ASAP. Yes, they actually call them a SWAT team. ;-)

    A lot. When you have your own, private zone, you can go compete with
other guilds on patch day, then when everything is dead go back to your zone
and farm at your leisure. Now they have to clear VT, or else you will.

    There's only two ways to stay number one on a server in EQ: be the best
by a very wide margin, or block the people behind you. Take PoP as an
example: one guild on my server passed the trials to go to PoS/PoV early on,
then only did PoS. They never left the zone. Eventually, they got into BoT.
After one month in BoT, they killed Agnarr. They're behind on flags
everywhere else, but they can kill Agnarr and block every other guild on the
server from progressing. For us to stay ahead of them, and stay ahead of
every other guild that was focused on all the other zones, would have
required us to either be extremely good or willing to blow old spawns that
would flag the competition.

    It's just begun for you. People that pull stuff like this don't change
overnight.

    He may have LOS aggro, but you really don't need to set up in the
hallways. There are better ways (especially considering how thin the walls
are in there).

    Congrats! It's always fun killing that first nasty mob. =)

    Which shards do you need?

    Ruh-roh!

    All people not part of the CC team leave, x-loc or gate. Group a
wizard/druid with Exodus in each CC group (shuffle people around if needed
to accomplish this). On the count of three, Exodus. Almost zero chance of
someone dying, barring linkdeaths.

    Soon, you will understand this joke one of our main tanks said on one
raid:

    "ENRAGE OFF on Aerin'Dar, get ready for Aerin'Dar Xakra!"
