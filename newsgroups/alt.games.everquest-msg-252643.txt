I practically live here, and can kite these things in my sleep.

Most important things you need for sentries are:

Affliction Haste IV focus
Sow or Run5

First off, clear the room first, makes it much easier to not worry about
adds.

From max distance, pull with SK.  Back up and cast BoT. Keep running to a
corner, you might have time to get FP off before the sentry gets to you,
probably not though. Run to opposite corner, using third person view and
rotating with alt-arrow keys to keep sentry in view. If you don't keep it in
view, it'll warp.  Apply another dot at opposite corner, FP if not on
already, could get SPlurt on as well, or pyro/dark plague, whatever you
normally kite with in there.  Engage pet.  BoT will fade in a sec, so get to
other corner and reapply.  While your dots are running, you can keep your
pet in melee range by running tight circles.  Takes a bit of practice to not
get hit, but the pet damage really speeds up the sentry kills.  Run to
corners to reapply dots as they fade, and keep running the tight circles in
between reapplications.  Throw a few mujakis in if mana is good.

Don't even bother with WTD on a sentry.. the cast time is way too long.

If you don't have affliction haste IV, you can only land mujaki and splurt
on the sentries, and SK on pull.  Do yourself a favour and pick up a ceramic
skull of decay.

BE SURE SOW IS FAIRLY FRESH BEFORE PULLING!  If you're not sure when you
last clicked your potion, use it again. If you lose sow, you're probably
going to die or FD and start over with a fully regenned sentry.  Plus a lost
pet if you already sent it in to attack and don't have pet FD yet.

These things are pie once you get used to them, I've kited 2 at once on more
than one occasion.  Just get afflict haste, keep sow up, dot on the diagonal
corners, and run tight circles to get pet in range while dots are running.
