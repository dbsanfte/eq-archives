Lesser Succor is most useful as a group spell.  I've saved the day
in many groups with a well timed Lesser Succor.  The drawback is
it has a chance of leaving any group member (including yourself)
behind.  Consider this spell an absolute requirement -- you never
know when you'll end up in a group.

I once cast Lesser Succor in Splitpaw just in the nick of time.
It saved everyone...except me who got left behind.  Doh.
