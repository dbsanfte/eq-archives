Do your self a favor and make a hotkey with /corpse on one line and /loc 
on the second line.  You will be needing it.
I didn't learn about locs until 2 days after someone gave me nice (to 
me, total newb) armor and a weapon. I got myself totally lost in Gfay, 
my home sweet home, got jumped by a centurion and didn't live very long. 
  Never did get that corpse.  When the person who gave me the stuff saw 
me, he asked, why didn't I get a loc?  well, I didn't even know what he 
was talking about then.  I didn't even know you could get maps and stuff 
online, and had no clue whatsoever there were newsgroups devoted to 
"that Ever-something game"

You need to figure out how to use the locs to find places.  What you 
need to do is print out some maps of a place you are familiar with 
already (www.eqatlas.com) and take a loc of where you are and then find 
a spot on the map using locs only.  Practice.  I had to take a day or so 
before I was familiar with it at all.  I still get lost anyway, don't 
even ask me to find a corpse underwater, I hate underwater locs with a 
passion.

Good luck.
