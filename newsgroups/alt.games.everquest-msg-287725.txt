Ooops sent by mistake. ...presumably invis.)

The slaves con Amiable to me, also evidence they are pets of a sort

Four of them armed with rusty two handers, are pretty fierce, tearing 
thru the rats and goblins down in the jail with ease

Sadly, I wipe trying to get back out, and when I return, the slaves seem 
to have died in the wipe too, no surprise, so now they are just normally 
armed.

Further observing them, acting en masse, they don't seem to taunt at 
all, meaning they usually can't get a mob off me, I have to tank it and 
just use them as DPS about half the time.

Unarmed, I never see that 9 damage I thought I saw before, high end 
seems to be 8.

With a lot of work, I manage to sneak back out to the scout position, 
killing one warrior who aggroed me on the way... I really miss those 
rusty two handers, the first bunch took out a similar warrior easily

Down into the rats and bats section, its just a matter of how quick I 
can aggro mobs, they die so fast.   Spiders and spiderling almost as 
simple, although I have to sit occaisionally to get hp back up.

At fourth level, I took on the Queen, me and the mob got her, but 
barely, by which I mean I went unconcious, then she died, I got exp and 
task credit, then the Iksar slave died, then I died, both of the poison.

I went back to the Queen's room, hoping the slaves would still be there, 
but they'd wandered off.  For comparison sake, I took her on solo... got 
her a mere 25% down before I died.

Proof of concept!
