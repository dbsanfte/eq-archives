Higher is better, of course; I think I had 136 wisdom at level 20
or so, but that was with the assistance of some gear given to me
by friendly strangers. Mainly an Othmir fur cap. By 35 or so I
had 180+ wisdom, but the improvement was mostly from gear
donated by my guild. This was with a halfling cleric, BTW.

For level 36 I think 140 wis is a little low; I would expect it to
be around the 150 mark, as there is some mid-level wisdom
gear that isn't too expensive.

I found that my ability to make cash increased dramatically from
around level 30, camping the giants in FM for sellable items.
Unfortunately once you hit 44 you can expect cash outlays to
skyrocket as buffs start using peridots.

But the key thing is... make sure you get a fair share of the loot.
Many tanks will instaloot anything they kill. Since autosplit
does *not* split evenly - it favours the looter(*) - they will wind up
with the lion's share of the platinum. However, *you're* the
one blowing platinum on jaspers, so make sure you get a fair
share. The relevance of this to wisdom is simple - it lets you
buy decent wis gear in the bazaar. :-) (If you don't have Luclin,
ask a trusted friend to go shopping for you.)

        ...Ronny

(*) For those who are curious, it seems to work like this: take
all types of coin and split evenly across all players. Looter gets
the remainder. So with 3 players, 2p/5g/7s/14c, looter gets
2p/3g/3s/6c and the others get 0p/1g/2s/4c.
