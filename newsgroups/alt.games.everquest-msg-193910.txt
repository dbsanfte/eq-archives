If it wasn't working as other than a self buff, then its new... the fact that
it was supposed to be group all along doesn't change the fact that it wasn't
actually a group spell before, and now it is.

Its new in that it might change the way we play.  On the other hand, it might
be lame, I know some group buffs aren't as good as single target ones at the
same or nearby levels.  Interesting to look into now though.  Not being a
shaman it won't matter all that much to me, except that I group with a wide
variety of people, many of whom don't keep up with all the latest changes.
If this -is- a good change, would be nice to let the shamen I'm with know
about it.
