I wasn't clear. Most of the coin you PP isn't worth that much. The
exception is Old World Giants. People make cash on drops sold in the
bazaar, more than anything you can PP. Lets say you are lowbie and
killing spiders, each silk may be 3-6pp, people are looting them and
you pick one or two, it isn't a big deal. You can't pick too many high
money drops, although I have picked quest items before.

People who go bananas over that usually are not the ones who are
broke. I guess thats my point, high level alts or no. You are not
really screwing over your group, any more than the fast looter is
doing the same thing. I have been in plenty of PC groups where the
melees get all the drops, saying FFA is FFA. Those guys ar the ones
complaining about pick pocketing because they don't know how little
you get from doing it.
