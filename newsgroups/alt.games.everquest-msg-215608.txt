The problem I am having with LDON is when people leave the
adventure....either through some hissy fit tantrum, they go LD and
don't come back, or for some other reason that is not the rest of the
group's fault.  

I also don't like how you can't invite another person into the group
as a replacement if someone bails after the quest has been given.  I
think a certain amount of time should be given to replace a party
member that leaves without causing the whole group to have to forfeit
and accept a loss.

Tonight, then minutes into the adventure, our main tank says, "gotta
go...everyone disband adventure now"

Why?

"I'm 10 years old and my daddy says I have to go to bed"

Then, our cleric LDed and didn't come back which left our Shammy to
heal.

The 4 others attempted to remain together, but we took a beating and
failed completely...did not even get the consolation points.   What a
waste of time.

People should expect at least 2 to 2 1/2 hours of gaming per
adventure....that includes time to get a group, move to location,
buff, med, and go in for the 90min adventure.   If you have only 10
minutes to play, don't get in an LDON group.
