 Yeah I've leveled a few characters to 30 on those. They are good xp
although sometimes when they run they pop outside and eventually they
start beating on you from above and you can't hit them back. It pays to
find out where the Dalnirs zone is if you're hunting the orange apes in
the cave.

 That almost sounds like a description of Droga as well.

 I think that was changed. I used to be able to swim up there as an
Iksar. However, I was there a couple months ago and it was a no go. I
had to actually run all the way around. Which was fun considering I had
no map. Perhaps some races still can swim up but I know last time I was
there I couldn't.
