10th Coldain Ring Quest. GD is EXTREMELY dangerous when this is going
on. It's a "war" script that goes off where the giants try to invade
Thurgadin. If the guild helping fails to repel the attack, Thurgadin
is pretty dead for several hours, as I understand it.

Normally, the raid party doing the quest will start screaming bloody
murder if too many people not involved in the quest (or any at all in
some cases) show up in the zone...
