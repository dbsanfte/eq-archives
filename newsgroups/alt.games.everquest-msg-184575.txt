Too many carbs. I have been drinking Martinis too, but I prefer
washing out the glass with the vermouth and then adding gin, I use
frozen gin, and a frozen glass. Enough vermouth sticks to the glass to
make it right.

Of course, I like scotch when I just want some whiskey, Johnny Red or
Black work. I can't afford Blue, ($160/bottle).
