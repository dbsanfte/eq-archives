An alternate approach would be  to have any mob that puts your pet on 
his hate list also put you on its hate list, regardless of whether you 
are invis or not.

Originally, pets had the same faction as their owners, and generally 
lower level, which created a lot of nasty situations.  Now pets are all 
nuetral unless something happens to put them on a hate list, so now 
changing the hate situation wouldn't be such a problem.

I think the idea really was to prevent people with pets from being 
invis; invis is a "not ready" state for pet classes.  Why this should 
be, however, is more of a mystery, and with the addition of the suspend 
AA, its not even true at high levels.  Other classes are quite ready 
while invis, in fact some (rogues) are at their most ready when invis, 
so they can position to open a fight with a backstab.

Splendid
