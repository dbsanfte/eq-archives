(oops this came out sounding like a troll, sorry!  Take no offense, I ramble
and rant but I'm seriously looking for info, despite that I got a bit
carried away.  Though I guess if there wasn't a bit of a troll meant in it
I'd rewrite it! ^_^ )

  Hey FV players, I have a question.
  Is the roleplaying server full of loot-farmer Super Guilds that every
other server is full of?  I like the game for the sake of the game, not loot
or being in the first guild to do whatever.  I'm sick of the Sullon Zek
twink wars (now that you can have 3 chars grrr) and I haven't played on a
regular server in months, I just can't stand all the camping farming arguing
bragging blah blah blah.  So I wanted to ask the higher level players on FV
if things are better there, before I say fuck it and quit.  I know the
population is the lowest on the list (after SZ) and that's a Good Thing, but
if I'm gonna see a whine-fest about "the childish guild that woke the
sleeper on Firiona Vie (waaah!)" sometime in the near future lemme know.
  Oh and I don't whine or make smart-ass rants in game, just on the
newsgroup, so no need to drive me off hah!
  I like roleplaying, I like the Game of Everquest, and I just wanna find
some people who are playing to have a good time, and hopefully in a place
where I don't meet too many of the loot obsessed powerlevelling Full Time
professional Gamers.  I like roleplayers, I like casual gamers, I even like
powergamers who know the difference between game and reality, and between
fun and "acclomplishment."
  Thanks all, for the help and also the flames that I dearly love to read!
;p
Oh and if I quit, no ya can't have my stuff, but you can watch it rot on a
corpse in the EC tunnel, on zebuxoruk where my highest char (pretty weell
equipped too!) will kill himself before I move to FV.  I'm usually pretty
generous, but it's hard to find a true newbie any more and I'm not giving
anything back to the fuckered economy I bought it from, so there!
