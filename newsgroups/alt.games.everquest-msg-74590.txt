Ummmm no.  Compared to most of the people I run into on the Mith-Marr
server, however, whether they ARE actually 10 or just act like it, 31 is
ancient.  I am 32 and feel like Methuselah.  I read the trilogy when I was
in 6th grade (1981) and the Silmarillion in 1983.  Been hooked ever since.
Went on to read a lot of stuff from TSR (at one point had 92 books in the
Dragonlance series) and many other fantasy (and sci-fi) writers.  I thought
the movie was okay, because it's always cool to see one of your favorite
books brought to "life", but very few movies stay completely true to the
book, and most take liberties with a lot of the story.  I liked the books
much better.
