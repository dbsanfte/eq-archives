Nope, backup heals just don't happen in an ae group.  You can expect to heal
your pullers each time they fetch more mobs, but once the killing begins you
can expect either

a) all the mobs are perma stunned and nobody gets hit
b) mobs aren't stunned for whatever reason.. your a few seconds from wiping

ps I prefer a.. thats why i would *never* AE with just 1 enchanter
