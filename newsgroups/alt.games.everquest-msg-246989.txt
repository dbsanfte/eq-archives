Actually, I just had a though. There are tools out there for yanking out all
traces of nVidia drivers (maybe ATI too.. I've never had to use one of
those). search fileplanet or voodooextreme or.. guru3d?

Anyway, try using one of those to rip out all your current nVidia driver
junk, and reinstall fresh with the latest or recommended driver version.
