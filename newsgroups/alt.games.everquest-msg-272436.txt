Right -- just like they don't in EQ until clerics get CHeal at
39.  Even after that, a group with a shaman can still go
pretty much everywhere.   Druids were/are a bit weaker
but lots of groups survived with druid healers.

Again, they're not really different.  What they did was balance
the classes, nothing more.

To make your point, tell us a place in EQ where you HAD
to have a ranger.    Or a mage.   Or a cleric, for that matter,
to *XP.*
