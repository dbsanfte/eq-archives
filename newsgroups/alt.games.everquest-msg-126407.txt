I've been doing charm, something, selos, charm.  Something may be healsong,
may be chain on the victim, Fufil on victim, Bellow... mainly its there to
change
the odds a little so my pet doesnt' die first, and to time when to do charm
again
assuming it doesn't break early.  Its so gratifying to have charm drop just
before
charm hits again!

Selos is there, though, because its very handy to be faster than the mobs when
charm is timed wrong, breaks early, or is resisted.  Six seconds of both (or
swarm)
beating on you and maybe interrupting charm recast is a long time.  TBoots would

help a lot there, I could do -two- useful things between charms and never be
interrupted in casting selos.

I don't find a wind instrument helps land charm or charm duration... I have a
mino horn I don't normally use, is it really helpful?  Been using drums for
faster selos and better dotsong effect...
