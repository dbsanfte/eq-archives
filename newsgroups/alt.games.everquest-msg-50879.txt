To descend while levitating, use the keys to "look" down, then when you walk
or run forward you will descend. The rate of descent is tied to the angle of
your view i.e. the more you look down, the faster you will descend. As far
as I am aware, ascending is not possible with levitation, unless you find a
wall that is not vertical, then you can run up.
