I'm not so sure healer's won't be smiting.  Since spells are much easier to
cast while being beat on in this game compared to EQ1, it doesn't seem as
necessary to stick to traditional roles.  Heck, in the priest/scout duo I'm
trying with a friend, my priest is logically the tank, so that scout can use
his positional attacks.  So I tend to smite, only healing when one of us
gets low on health, at least on most fights--on particularly tought fights I
might switch to pure healing.
