    There are other variations, but most of them only show up in force in
the higher-end of things. Things like varying the aggro type of a mob, or
the effect of a special attack. The real problem might be this: EQ was
designed originally so that you had to grind to 46 and above, and then you'd
arrived at the endgame raids. Then they tacked on ten levels, and made you
grind through THEM to reach endgame content. So for ten levels or so, you
feel like the game is just there to make you waste time.

    That sounds like a variation on "aggro off healing spells", only done in
a "fudge it" kind of way. DAoC does a lot of things like that: throw out
suspension of disbelief (how do they know who the healers are?) to
accomplish specific game balance goals. Some will like the playability that
can be achieved that way, others will find the game world false. BAF is the
other example that springs to mind of forcing things to work way X so that
play balance can be discovered quickly by the designers.

    I imagine that's an artifact of the soloability in DAoC. If mob
abilities spiked, PC abilities would have to do the same. In EQ, with its
forced grouping mentality, mobs HAVE to gain skill faster than PCs.

    I don't think that's what DFH was getting at. For me, I'd say the
turnoff about DAoC PvE is that it's pointless: all you're doing is getting
XP to get to the PvP endgame, and gathering money for tradeskills. In EQ,
PvP suffers because of the PvE emphasis; I imagine the reverse will happen
in DAoC.

>many people to DAOC.

    What may very well attract a TON of people to DAoC is the "casual gamer"
atmosphere it has. Consider:
-all classes soloable
-once you have your tradeskills capped, nobody can pass you in gear
-the endgame is STATIC: you will always be fighting the other realms, and
whenever you log on you can go attack whoever is in the other realms.
-downtimes are very low for combat, meaning a sense of accomplishment can be
obtained in a very short time

    There is one important difference, Dennis: a lot of the asshole
behaviour is being hardcoded out of the system. You can't taunt what you
can't even communicate with (although dual-account morons can still tell you
how hard they r0x0red your b0x0rs). Likewise, denial of the ability to play
period will be very difficult when the victim keeps repopping behind a wall
of damn-tough guards. All you can do is act like a very intelligent NPC in
stalking and killing the PCs in another realm. Whether PvP fans WANT to kill
a horde of nameless, faceless PCs is another question....
