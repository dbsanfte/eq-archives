> Most enchanters hate slowing.

I know I do.  In a group situation where CHA is important I can buff my INT
to 170 with my CHA buffed to 200.   Casting a 200 mana spell (often multiple
times due to resists) gets really annoying when Shaman my level have 190+
WIS more often than not.  I usually group with shaman higher level than me
(being an enchanter I usually get into groups earlier than most other
classes) so they're resisted less often than me.

I have no idea if this is correct, but according to castersrealm Annul seems
to be a poor upgrade to Nullify.  The difference seems to be only the
casting time (from 4.5 to 4 seconds) and a better chance of removing *2*
buffs.  Hopefully someone with the spell will read this and clarify.
