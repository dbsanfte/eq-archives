I hate BB and always port myself to steamfront and go along the path to gfay
(yeah ok I'm sure there's faster ways to get there but I get lost real
easily) anyway occasionally I will see people looking to goto gfay and offer
my taxi (especially if its for a CR) but let them know closest I can go is
BB or steamfront.
