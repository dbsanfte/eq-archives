Nope, with root, snare, dots, lifetaps... necros don't need a pet.  While
pet is of course a handy helper in some tactics, and -the- damage
producer in some and -the- damage absorber in others... but you don't
need him and could happily solo or group from one to 60 without
a pet at all.  Can't think of any necro spell line you couldn't say the
same thing about.

Yep, probably snare type spells, and if you really pushed me I'd
probably say the same for necros... but not very loudly.

Yeah, but is it really better than the inexpensive, scales as you
go up, pet complete heal?  I can't say for sure, having not played
my BST past 19.. at that level anyway, being able to keep my
pet alive thru 6 or so complete full hp to near death cycles in
a row was very handy indeed.
