Maybe. But if you asked them to emulate EQ on it, which is the topic of 
this thread the maximum number of CPUs they would use for the emulator 
would hit around 2 if that.

No amount of money is going to let you turn x86 emulation into a 
massively parallel application.

But total available speed in teraflops *DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING* here.

If I have 1 car that can go 100 miles per hour. I can not drive 800 
miles per hour if I buy 7 more identical cars. My total available speed 
is still 100 miles per hour... at least when determining how fast I'm 
going to get anywhere. All the extra cars let me do is let me lend them 
out to 7 friends and let them all go 100 miles an hour to their 
destinations at the same time.

Same with the Cray. An EQ emulator is one lousy simple task. It will go 
as fast as one processor can take it... it cannot be split up among 
multiple cpus to go faster, just as driving cannot be accelerated by 
owning multiple cars.

Because its important. You should be concerned about 'per cpu' too.
