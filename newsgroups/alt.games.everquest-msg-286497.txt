	We're not complaining about the downtime.  We're complaining
about the inconsiderate and unnecessary worse-than-lack of the kind of basic
customer service even Ma&Pa ISP L.L.C. can provide.  (Well, at least I am)

	I'm also complaining about the kind of slapdash quality control
that rolls out a massive patch to critical functionality without even testing
it.  I know it's just a game.  It's the principal of the thing, really.  To 
paraphrase Horton the Elephant, "Bullshit is Bullshit, no matter how small".

	It's also hard not to at least roll your eyes over nonsense like
network status pages that don't have network status, isn't it?  Or are 
you immune to irony?
