...then there's something wrong with his computer.

I run Everquest just fine (post-Luclin) with a
500 MhZ Celeron, 512MB RAM, and cruddy i810 chipset video,
even when the cable modem service craps out and I have
to revert to 56k dial-up.

Even the other computer, a 400MhZ Celeron with 384MB ram,
works well enough that it doesn't qualify as being
described as "lagging like hell".

My bet is he has some other software running in the
background which is interfering with EQ.  My nephew's
computer had that problem until he figured out what
task(s) to nuke.
