There's a bigass difference between a plate tank with 10k+hp unbuffed and
buttloads of +shielding and a 9.6k buffed no +shielding plate tank. :)

Our lead GoD exploration team is  War, Pal, Shm, Dru, Enc, Rog (Notice all
the healing redundancy) any they don't try to actually tank stuff but
use Mr. Pooka to do the work.  I'm in team 2 and when we dropped a DPS class
for a Dru things got way way easier.  Team 2 is War, Clr, Dru, Nec, Enc, Rng
just for information purposes.  Our first trip to the mountains was kinda
ugly but that's mostly a matter of getting a feel for the mobs and reacting
appropriately. T2 will get into KT eventually.  May have to sub in a Rog to
do a SoS run for the win but it'll get there.  We will use pooka's for the
DPS tho.  Wins for both Team1 and Team2 just are not going to happen without
them.

: met too many people who didn't enjoy the tipt design/content

I'm mostly pissed off at the existance of GoD so take my comments on the 
content there with a cow-lick of salt. :)  That said, there is some fun stuff
there. CoW event in Barindu is kinda fun, especially the mayhem on pulling
the non-mez non-charm golem things before going after the snakes.  Zum Votal
is a fun mob to kill as well with some pretty nice drops.  Our raid leader
doesn't want to try the Ferubi Packmaster quite yet but hell, I think learing
how hard it would stomp us into paste would be informative.  Our 1 win
at the Qinimi Dome event turned kinda south since 30s after the win we all
got ported out so all the drops got wasted.  Talk about suck.
