Not a problem. Code it so it never takes more than one item from a stack
(which is, effectively, the way it works now). Take your 18 spiderling
silks, put 8 in one slot & 10 in the other and hit combine. The game will
keep attempting combines till you get a "does not combine error" (in this
case, leaving you with no silks in one slot and 2 in the other).

Now that may be a concern (though I'd really hope VI could invest in a nice
random number generator ... they aren't all that hard to write). If it is a
concern though, then only attempt a single combine with each button press
(but only consume one item from each stack).
