Drat. I'd have chosen froglok too .... but in the event that choice
is gone I'd have to choose an Eye of Zom. have you seen one of those
things jump? I got the Elder Holgresh necklace yesterday by complete
fluke (was hunting for a strong stick, got killed by him, got pissed
off, went back full health and mana and vengeance whacked him) and
discovered he carries a necklace with infinite charges of Eye of Zomm.

Its great! Its like lassie! ;)

I invoke my eye, scoot up to a player a few rooms away who I want to talk
to and hover in front of his face. Then I begin jumping up and down to
get his attention.

"Whats that boy? Suiddarus fallen down a mine shaft? You want me to
follow you? Ok!"

Hee ;) I've got to say actually, some of my greatest entertainment in
EQ comes from the player usable illusioned races that verant never
put in a jump animation for - the eye, the stiff legged happy puppy
vertical bounce in wolf form, and so on ;)
