Everytime you finish looting a corpse whether you loot something or
not it saves your character. The saves are merely a formality i think
though, I think what you're talking about is the fact that you have to
rememorize all your spells again because hotkeys and such are saved n
your computer and aren't affected by the saved thing in game. The save
thing is just your factions and your exp/level/skills/equpment/money
and all that stuff.
