First, the mobility offered by the Nexus to non porting characters is a GOOD
thing. I'm glad other characters have a way to get from here to there
without walking the whole way.

Second, I hear what you are saying about no ports to Luclin, and I'm not
happy about it either... they could AT LEAST let us port to nexus.

Third, I think that you are missing the Main "silent nerfing" that has gone
on here. The MAIN thing that I'm upset about since Luclin has come out is:
WolfForm. Why does everyone on luclin HATE WolFForm? Has any reason ever
been given? It just makes no sense other that to take away an ability druids
have always had. Sure Wolform is OK in most or the old world, and can ever
increase your faction some places, it makes sense. The Barbarians of the
north don't like it, sure I can believe that. But the EXACT SAME RACE/CLASS
combo from Norrath that gets placed upon the moon HATES me in WolfForm.

Take this for example. Of course all druids love other druids and wolves,
and it goes to reason that they like Druid in wolform even better. Every
Druid in every guild and ring on norrath likes me in wolfform. Then I go up
to twilight sea and change into wolform and who attacks me? the same
Human/Druid npc that was just smiling amiably at me before I changed. It
makes no sense and seems to be purely aimed at limiting the usefulness of
that ability.
