Every time I start to think that God doesn't have a sense of humor, I just
look in the mirror.

I have friends of all faiths and we just agree that we disagree and leave it

opportunity is there, but we just laugh it off.

Tolerance is what's missing in most religions, at least in my humble
opinion.
