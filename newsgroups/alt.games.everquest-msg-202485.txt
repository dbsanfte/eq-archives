No offense intended at all, but this is a case study the type of character
the change was targeted at.

Not a slam ... just an observation.

Good question.  I'd wager they'll be affected some, but not too much.

Druids and wizards said that the PoK would be the end of their porting
monopoly.  I simply haven't seen that to be the case.  I see people donating
for ports to EJ and Skyfire all the time, even though with the PoK you can
land one zone over from each.  Heck, I see people in the Nexus wanting ports
to Dawnshroud. ;-)

The 43+ crowd will still be there.  That's a lot of casters.
