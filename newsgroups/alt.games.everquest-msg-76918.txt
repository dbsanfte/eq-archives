Sheesh, is there anyplace an artist/writer can become a puter geek? Gosh, I
don't reboot unless the system locks up or I install new software. With ME,
I was rebooting *all the time*, but XP has proven to be very stable. Ok, so
I'll reboot next time it happens... any chance of figuring out what's going
on with it? I turn off my firewall, McAffee, OE, MSN Messenger... basically
everything that I see running in the task bar. Guess that's not the only
place I need to look, huh (sheepish look). Uhh... anything else I need to
know? Haven't gotten the message since I wrote this note, and I was in EQ
for 6 hours screwing around with my enchanter. Nothing happened, no error
message.

thanks,
Darklet
