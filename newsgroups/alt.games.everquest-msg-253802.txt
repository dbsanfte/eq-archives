Yeah, that's about all you can do is keep working on the skill.  More on
other skills a little bit in the later paragraph.

From what I've read of the Intimidation skill on monks and rogues, building
up other weapon skills helps this.  Rogue intimidation involves the rogue
doing little dance that involves waving his arm a little bit, then (and not
necessarily in this order) a slash move, a bash move, a stab, and if
successful, a kick.  Note: this is the ONLY time you ever see a rogue kick.
Rogues do not get the kick skill listed amoungst his abilities.

The monk intimidation dance is a bit similar.  Wave of the hand, 1H Blunt
movement, 2H Blunt movement, kick, drop kick, etc.  I could /never/ get it
to work before my monk got the ability to drop kick.

Now, I can't vouch for how much weight weapons skills help, as by the time
my rogue's 1H Slash and 1H Blunt weapn skills were respectable, I was in PoP
zones, where the mobs can't be intimidated easily (if at all).  (Note: I did
run across the occasional skunk in Plane of Mischief that could be feard.
But trying to kill a feared but unsnared mob in PoM is MUCH badness.)  I'd
love to know if weapon skills help this.

*ALSO,* I'm wondering if dexterity has anything to do with this.  Anyone
who's played a melee toon high enough should know that weapon procs go off
depending on the dexterity.  I'd love to know if the success rate of
Intimidation is based on weapon skills, dexterity, and/or a combination of
the two.
