Made 56th With Druid, finally...Warrior was working on AA's so hasn't made
it to 56 yet. Enchanter has had far too many unrez'd (I can never be
bothered to wait for one) deaths so is just under halfway.

Been P/L'ing an SK in Sky Shrine managed to get all the Guardian Armour
pieces I was after.
Killed Lt Milven (didn't know at the time he was a quest npc and no one in
zone for it to effect anyway) and looted a Square Helm! Some poor sod must
of given it too him thinking it was a Giant Warrior Helmet, oh well, yay me.

Headed off to Qeynos to grab some missing spells (This SK has not been
played since SoL) hit track (Druid bot) on leaving SF Glade just in case
someone has misstimed Hadden...No Hadden but...Pyzjn!!! Follow directions
from Druid and there's Pyzjn at the ruins, no one else about. I have
abolutely no offensive spells mem'd on Druid or 'chanter...So I HT her...She
drops GBS (/sigh I can remember when she was perma camped and it was worth
10k+) and I take such a faction hit with Blood Sabers I have to go and see
the Dismal Rage chaps in Freeport for spells and training...oops.

Hit 34 with SK and chat to PoD...Have my first red named character...don't
ask why it was just something I wanted to do, besides this is now one
character I can NEVER p/l again :�) of course I can't group either.

With the sale of GBS and Square Helm I should have enough plat to keep my
druid in Opals for a month or too....Karana can kiss my wood elf butt,
there'll be no more rain or snow when I'm about
:�)

RL sucked a bit, Cam belt's gone on my car and although I have the cash to
and fully intended on getting a new one I wanted to hold on until I saw the
right one rather than buy the first one that fits the bill :�/
