I have played EQ for over 5 years and may be dropping it for WoW. I 
absolutely love the feel of WoW. Anyone notice how certain zones just have a 
"feel" to them? You go into Westfall and you can imagine being on a drought 
blasted farm, go into the Dorf section of Stormwind and you can almost smell 
the coal smoke of the forges. And here is a great little thing about WoW: 
the other night I clicked on the icon and in 42 seconds the game had loaded, 
character had been selected and I was attacking a mob! I like being able to 
log on and solo or duo w the Mrs. EQ had made me jaded, too many nights 
spending forever to get a group. EQ2 has crazy requirements (I play on my 
laptop). WoW so far is what I have been looking for.
