I'm a newbie level 22 druid and am currently using a Velium Scimitar. I 
realize I'm not a melee class, so maybe investing in a stronger weapon 
isn't what I should do. If I should find something better, however, what 
should I look for and what would it cost? I don't have much money and 
would like to save a bit for level 24 spells.

Any ideas?
