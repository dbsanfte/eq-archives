If this story is true, why would this intelligent person with no sense
of gaming "morality" miss the obvious financial opportunity this
presented?  Invest $100 on a character, play for a few days to get
level 65, 350 AA's, and all keys/flags you possibly can.  Ebay for
$500 to $1000.  Repeat on another server.
