I think by saying it's too late to do now, he means, you have level 1
players already wearing FBR.  It really is to late to say sorry you
can't equip this, when it's already equipped.  Esp if it's something
like, okay as soon as you remove it you cant equip it any more.  So some
person who is say level 8 wear the fbr dies at an orc camp in EC.  Get
back to their corpse and now has no wearable equipment, doesn't have
room to loot their corpse as a result, etc.  It would have to be on a
new server with the rule in place from day one as i see it.

Except for a few items in certain dungeons this doesn't happen anymore. 
Najena-- Empty, Cazic Thule--Empty, Mistmoore--Empty, Dalnir--Empty,
Droga--Empty, Kaesora--Empty.  Most of the dungeons people get Twink
gear from are empty these days, so they might as well be getting used
some.  If it's not an empty dungeon, it's people fighting who can get
experience and the loot that drops is utter crap for the level.  Cured
Tizmac tunic, AC15 same as banded.  You have to be around level 30 to
get a Cured Tizmac Tunic, not many are in banded at that level, because
by that level you can do your class specific armor quests in Sol Ro, and
have much higher ac, and Level appropriate gear.  Merchants don't pay
squat for the the tizmac stuff, nor for the velium weapons which they
drop, which is essentially fine steel with a "Magic" tag, so you can
fight ghouls and willowisps etc.  Velious it seemed was designed for
twinking lower level characters whether that was verant's intent or
not.  I think the velium weapons from tizmacs are about 1 per 3 kills,
so they pile up fast, you get maybe 4 platinum for them, you may as well
give it to someone lower level at that point.  

Yes stuff like the FBSS and that sort of thing is overcamped and farmed,
but even some of that is by people who are getting experience for
killing the mobs who drop it.  Same thing with GEB's, etc, both of which
you need to be 40+ even to try to camp.
