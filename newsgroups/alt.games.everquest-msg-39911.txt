Not the only fun but certainly great fun to discover things on your own.

Nope not a regular reader of spoiler sites. Yes I have read them whem
horrbly stuck.

Don't confuse zone design with TCC. Sola has been empty forever. Just
because folks don't like lava and tunnels. It has nothing to do with the
TCC.

Ummm dunno where that came from but. Highlevels AREN'T needed. Every start
on a new server a few times ? Btw my first character was a rogue during the
era prior to hide sneak working together. The special super duper item of
eliteness isn't needed to play the game and have fun. Why not try going with
the gear you loot. Yes this was harder before more folks became NBG.
Camping, twinking, buying gear in EC are all illusions of Need. What ? Never
learned what sees invis but not sneak such as many bats. It happens with
folks too gear dependatnt instead of skill dependant. What ? only have a
group/guild that only does things if something is in it for them. Now too
many folks care too much about the bubbles of exp they lose if something
goes wrong. The fun exploring take a risk loose a level or two on discovery
days may be gone. Too many folks only play to get to that uber level of
eliteness with the What's in it for me attitude.

I hope TCC changes that. If the selfish folks that need babysitters quit.
