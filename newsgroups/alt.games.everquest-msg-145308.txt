To be honest, only cel is bothered enough to entertain me with a game of
"guess who!" :)  Unless its malicious, ive got better things to worry
about.. and only 1 time has there been a case of that (was from this NG tho,
not the server channels)

No thats my monk.  Each character has their own icon or computer, which has
their own custom autojoin list.  So when im running bots (cleric or shaman)
they don't appear in the channel (at least 99% of the time they don't)

It makes sense that way, cuz all my shaman has to do is press 1-4 (malo,
slow, canni, torp), and all my cleric has to press is 2-4 and alt+4 (cheal,
elix, divine, MoR).. I can do that blindly (tho fizzles can sometimes be a
killer heh)
