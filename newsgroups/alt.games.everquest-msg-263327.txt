	I tried final fantasy online when it came out, and couldn't really get 
into it.  This was one of the reasons, they did this.  Everyoen ran 
around not even talking to each other.  See someone in trouble, can't 
even help them, unless htey are smart enough to disengage   which then 
allows others to attack (can you disengage in eq2?).  Of course, if they 
disengage and start running, and you *don't* help like they hoped you 
would, then they just threw away what little chance they probably had of 
actually finishing it off just before it killed them. It then follows 
them, all the way across the zone until it kills them. Thus, often 
they'd want to hang on to what little chance they thought that had, so 
would not disengage, and would then die w/you sitting right there unable 
to help.  Plus, it just feels incredibly unrealistic.  There're a bunch 
of creature X's that I can attack . . . except that one!  This other guy 
can attack it, but I can't.  Also, ya still have competition, everyone 
running around trying to 'tag' something first.  No bitter arguments or 
anything at least, but its a weird kind of competition takes you out of 
the game experience as its so counter-intuitive, and again, unrealistic. 
  Better to just make the zones large enough, the spawns frequent 
enough, the mobs numerous enough, limit the server poulation enough, 
vary the starting locations enough, have enough locations and quests, 
whatever, such that ya don't have to worry about several individuals 
trying to get the same mob.

	Another thing I didn't like was how it took like 5 levels to get a new 
ability, many of which were passive, so didn't even change how combat 
played out or anything.  Plus, ya didn't 'choose' them as ya levelled up 
or anything, rather new abilities simply came in a pre-ordained order. 
Your level 10 whatever is just like someone else's level 10 whatever, 
though you might have different items equipped.  You could combine 
classes in a unique way, which was interesting, but man, talk about 
having a long wait to get to that point.  How's EQ2 in this regard?
