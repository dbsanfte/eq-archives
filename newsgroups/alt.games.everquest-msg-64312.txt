The point was, you all bitch about a game taking away precious amounts of
your time (wow you have to be on a tight schedule to sit and bitch an moan)
and then you say a several men losing 14 years of their life a non-important
issue because it doesn't effect YOU.

I sometimes just wish something bad would happen to you
flamers/not-so-smart-people so you realize how bad you actually have it
which, FYI, isn't half as bad as you think.

Whatever.
