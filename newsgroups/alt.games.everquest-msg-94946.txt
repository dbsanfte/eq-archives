nice to get a discussion started here, well why do they get all the
public? can't someone else get the medias attention and show that not
all americans agree with general bush? 

how most people in my country(denmark) look at americans right now:

to force everyone else into buy more guns so he can have a new <insert
war here>

please prove them wrong
