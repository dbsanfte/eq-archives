Damage caps are 20 until 10th and 29 until 20th (Both these figures can be
exceded with high strength but I doubt a sub 20 character will see a hit
over 31)

I have never run any program like showeq so I am no expert on the engine
(feel free to correct me if you Know I am wrong here)
The damage dealt by a weapon is 2xdam + bonus (normally people just add 1
for ease) the bonus will go up as you level this seems to correspond with
damage bonus listed on the weapon, or at least all 1hders have 9 dam bonus
for me. The multiplier never changes (always 2x) but, on top of this your
Attk stat (raised by skill in the weapon, offence and strength) will also
effect your damage in a positeve way and your opponents defence and AC in a
negative way.
When you hit 20 the Claw will not suddenly start doing over 30 damage but as
you go up in level (and skill) you will see it hitting marginally harder. If
however you had a 20 damage weapon then you would start seeing a difference
after 20 as the cap would have been restricting it.

I don't use any Warrior or Melee sites but Both Monkly Business and The
Steel Warrior sites will likely cover it in more depth and accuracy than I
did.
