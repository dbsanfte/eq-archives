Well, maybe he didn't.  The quote I was remembering was apparently, "If 
they actually communicated directly with your family, its another matter."  
That pesky word 'if' again. :) 

}All I got from him was that their attacks match my victim mentality.

Well, they do.  You repeatedly set yourself up as flamebait, and then 
whine most amusingly when flamed.  That's a victim mentality.  How they 
choose to attack you is based on what will make you whine most and 
loudest.  Personally, I don't think their method is according to hoyle, 
but I can see why they chose it.  And, more to the point, I can see why 
they would want to attack you.

}I wouldn't put too much stock in what he says anyways..  He also said

}jump on the bandwagon" or words to that effect..

I don't see what your problem with that is.  You did, momentarily, give 
the impression of being someone who had done some research into the whole 
'special rights' debate.  It's rather a shame you didn't back it up.

}Look at him now...

Still looks sane and logical...

Perhaps they're plain as day if we're privy to your special private 
language.  Is the dictionary of EQ-speak in paperback yet?

}>}Your response has been, to a T.....   
}>}"I did not say that"
}>}W/o providing ANY factual basis to back it up..
}>I'm afraid the onus lies on you to prove he -did- say it, without twisting

}The onus???  :^)  

Onus n. 1. a) Burden b) Disagreeable necessity 2. Burden of proof.

}In fact he did..  :^)

Well, it's all well and good to -say- that.  How about proving it?  You 
claim he didn't provide a 'factual basis' to back up his not having said 
it.  Well, here's the evidence:  He didn't say it in this post here. 
He didn't say it in that post there.  He didn't say it in the other post 
over there.  In, fact,he didn't say it anywhere.  Now, perhaps you'd care 
to point at where he -did- actually say it.  Not where you think he might 
have said something with three words in common with it, but where he 
actually said what you caim he did.

}>}While it might not be word for word what you said, the meaning is
}>}clear..
}>Only if we use 'EQ's Very Special Dictionary of What Words Really Ought to 
}>Mean for his Convenience'.
}And only when debating someone who is so ambigious that their words
}can be interpreted as anything.

His ambiguosity is an assumption on your part, and is not a justifiable 
assumption.  His words can be looked up in any reasonable dictionary, and 
it's rather presumptuous of you to assume that they can be interpreted as 
anything other than their usual meaning in everyday english.  However, you 
seem to think that you have a 'special right' to intepret words to mean 
whatever you want them to mean.  You're quite wcome to feel that, but you 
must realize that some people will find it very, very annoying, and will 
ook for ways to get back at you for it, and since viscous personal attacks 
on your family seem to wrk so well, what do you expect?

}>}Much like the meaning was clear re: that Lesa post.. Everyone got it
}>}but her. 
}>}And THAT is because she did not WANT to get it..  
}>She never said she didn't get it, she said she wasn't sure, and would like 
}>clarification before answering.  Clarification which you resolutely 
}>refused to provide.
}Even not being sure is ridiculous.  Everyone else understood it just
}fine.. Nice try, but you will have to do better.

Again, the onus is on you to prove that she did not want to get it.  I 
thought not being sure, given that she is talking to soeone who is clearly 
ambiguous and inconsistent in hisusage of, and coprehension of, the 
english language was a perfecty sane and intelligent move.  Not ridiculous 
in the least.

}>}If she got it, she would have to address it.  But she couldn't address
}>}it w/o admitting that her posts make her out to be a hypocrite...
}>Actualy, her posts didn't make her out to be a hypocrite at all, and 
}>you've yet to provide evidence to the contrary.
}Really??

Yes, really.

}On the one hand she says that she tells her children to be nice and
}don't cap on people..   Does she practice what she preaches??  Nope.

Yes, actually, she does.  You hit first, and repeatedly.  I'm sure she 
would instruct her child that they are allowed to discriminate to some 
degree after such an event.

}On the one hand she says that I don't know her enough to judge her as
}this or that.  Yet she turns around and calls me all sorts of names as
}if she knows anything about me.

I haven't seen her call you many names at all, until today.  Yet you seem 
quite free to label her as a loony left PC liberal hypocrite.  If those 
aren't names, I dunno what are.  And for all you know, she might be a 
conservative.

}Would you like additional examples??  Or are you sufficiently
}spanked?? 

I'd like one example that's based on what she actually said, please.

}>}Within the same post, you say that USENET posts are irrelevant in the

}>}Then 2 paragraphs you claim that you would be happy to ignore me, but

}>}"I said, I'd be happy to ignore you, but ignorant idiots like you make

}>You'll note,in the excerpt you quoted, the difference between the phrases

}>of reference to USENET.  Try again.
}Nice tap dance...
}So, if I were to say, "Complete and utter fools like you" you wouldn't
}take that to mean I thought you a complete and utter fool???

No, I'll concede that he called you an ignorant idiot.  However, he 
never said that YOU were (or are even able to) HARMING him trough USENET 
posts.

}You see what I mean by ambigious??  BS says something that everyone
}knows what he means, but said in such a way that, when he is called on
}it, he can say "Well I didn't mean THAT!!"....

He never said he didn't call you an idiot.

}>}Ergo, you won't mind me continuing my USENET crusade, right???   :^)
}>}Go ahead... Yer allowed to weasel and waffle now..
}>Oh, but you're so much better at it.  why don't you show us how weaseling 
}>and waffling is really done by a real professional?
}You already have perfect examples of that in BS's posts...  When I
}make a statement, I take a stand.  If I am shown evidence that I am
}wrong (evidence, not the mealy-mouthed whinings of the loony left PC)
}than I admit I am wrong.  As I have done so.

Those 'mealy-mouthed whinings' are also evidence.  And I haven't seen BS 
waffle once yet.  Clarify, sure.  But his position has not changed.  
Yours, however, seems to be all over the map.

}On the other hand, BS et al makes arguments that, when you get really
}nit-picky, can be twisted to mean anything.  That way they NEVER have
}to admit they are wrong.  They simply accuse the opposing debater that
}he/she misunderstood their words..

Just because something -can- be twisted to mean anything doesn't mean you 
should.  Part of the whole art of reading is being able to figure out what 
an author means when he strings some words together.  You seem to lack 
this ability.  Declaring that the words mean whatever you wanted them to 
mean at the moment does not count as actually 'reading'.  Reading is 
Fundamental.

}>}>> Geeeeee.... Let me think on that one....

}>conclude from that that everyone gets it but you, and THAT is because you 
}>don't WANT to get it?
}Nice try.. But lame..   :^)

Strange you should think so.  It's the exact same argument you've been 
using in reference to BS's supposed 'inconsistencies' and Lesa's 
reluctance to answer the question you never clearly asked.  I'm glad you 
see how lame it is when it's turned on you.  Now, try to apply that 
standard to your own arguments.
