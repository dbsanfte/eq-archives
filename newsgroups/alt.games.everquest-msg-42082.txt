This is why before Evade was put in, rogues were a "broken" class.
They could generate sick amounts of damage but wouldn't have anywhere
near the AC/hps to handle the aggro generated from that damage making
them utter mana sponges.

With Evade, a rogue can pretty much generate damage to his/her heart's
content.

And remember how Evade works, it's a skill check, there's no
resistence check against it.  You can successfully evade from the
toughest mobs in the game.
