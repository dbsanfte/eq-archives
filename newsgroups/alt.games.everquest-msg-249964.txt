Someone obviously pointed out how badly it was being received, and
"get a new one up there like YESTERDAY, damnit!"

:-)

Probably Brenlo filling in some dumb marketting type from above.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
