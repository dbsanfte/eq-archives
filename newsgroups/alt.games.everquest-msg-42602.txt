At Level 8 I ran my Ench to Felwithe to get Enchant Silver, then ran him
back to BB and caught the boat to FP then stayed in EC farming cat pelts,
bear skins and spider silks until the xp ran dry at about level 14. By then
I'd earnt 1300pp and this bought me some nice gear. It was funny hearing ppl
call me a twink when I'd paid for all the nice gubbins on me (including
batgain of the month 110pp for a Sarnak Ceremonial Dagger for the range
slot, whoop!). Currently I reside in Hk having had a so-so trip to LOIO
between 15-19. Never liked that zone much.

Such is this Gnome's tale,

Xipat - Level 21 Gnomish Enchanter, Morrell Thule
