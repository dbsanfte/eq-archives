Oh, there's tension between any two races you'd care to name.  Everyone
hates the dark elves (dark elves even hate each other), the high elves don't
like the wood elves because they lack self-restraint and snobbery, the wood
elves hate the high elves because high elves are overly restrained and
snobby, the high elves don't like the humans because humans chop down their
pretty forests, dwarves don't like humans because humans hog gold just as
viciously as they do, elves don't like dwarves because dwarves shut
themselves away from the trees and sun, humans don't like halflings because
halflings trick everyone out of their money, ogres and trolls don't like
each other because they're competitors for the same territories, et cetera.
