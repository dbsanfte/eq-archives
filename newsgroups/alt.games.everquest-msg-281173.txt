Why do you think this is a graphics card problem
out of interest? It looks like either a network problem, or a
file permissions problem; the file either can't be downloaded
from Sony, or can't be written to your hard drive.

In either case, that wouldn't have anything to do with your
graphics card. If you're not logged in as administrator, try
running the patcher as administrator and see if that fixes it; also
try using ctrl+alt+del and the running processes tab to kill any
processes (you can't break your computer here, don't worry) that
you can, and try running the patcher again. PRobably dont want
to kill explorer though ;)

Well, unless you've subsequently gotten past the p[atching problem and
are now having a display error you're not telling us about, I'd 
think its someone fobbing you off - you're not on our supportedc
list, wheee, call resolved, +1 SLA.
