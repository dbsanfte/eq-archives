Hrrrm.  I was killing the mud burrowers near the entrance from 
Shadeweaver's Thicket around level 7 or 8.  They were dark blue to me 
and went down pretty easily... though they *are* social, so I had to 
watch out for gangs of 'em.

Better with the senate r-something sprouts... I worked my way through 
the tunnel to the first big cavern with the lake and killed the littlest 
mushroom things.  For some reason, like the beetles in Shadeweaver's, 
they don't have a name over their heads, so it took me a while to 
realize that they were a mob.  The sprouts *don't* social, and neither 
they nor the burrowers and their ilk are aggressive.

I moved onto muck diggers and senate juveniles once they dark-blued to 
me; the juveniles drop bits of armor occasionally and both they and the 
sprouts drop chunks of themselves (ewwww) which is nice stackable loot. 
    (Everyone loves stackable loot!)

Killing became easier once I hit 9 and got the warder, even if Laburnum 
has a tendency to push mobs into walls.  ;)

Currently, at 14-almost-15, I've started exploring the other tunnels and 
caverns that branch out from that one.  Gotta watch for the fiends; 
they're aggressive, they cause disease, *and* I hear that they are 
social.  Been avoiding 'em like the plague.  :)  Haven't done much, 
though... been too busy back in Shadeweaver's Thicket fighting the Loda 
Kai and their ilk.  Gotten from indifferent to amiable with the 
Guardians of Shar Vahl doing that, yay!

Shadeweaver's Thicket is a nice place to hunt if you're interested in 
tailoring, by the way.  The Xakra worms and lesser shades drop shadeling 
silk, the Shak Dratha drop shade silk, and *all* of the hopper types, 
from needle-claws to saureks on up, drop pelts.  Plus, there's a bank 
and a tailoring merchant named Tiamon Aroo right in the zone.

Happy hunting!
