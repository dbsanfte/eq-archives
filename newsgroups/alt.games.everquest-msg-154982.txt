Yeah, we know that.  We do tend to only admit reasonably mature players,
though.  That helps a lot.  If the guild leaders tell the guild that a
certain raid requires certain numbers of certain classes, and that having
more than a certain number of people will cause problems with lag or
whatever, we've always had plenty of people offer to pull out, or go get
their alts of more useful classes, if they are high enough.

We also have good connections to top tier guilds.  For some reason, for a
long time, SoV was kind of like uberguild high school--a lot of people from
guilds such as LoS were Scions before they graduated to uber status and left
us.  Those leavings were almost always friendly, and so we can usually get a
little help from the top guilds if we need it. :-)

Well, keep in mind that Verant has some pretty strange notions about how the
game should be played. :-)  MT + CH chain seems to be the only way to do
many high end mobs, but Verant doesn't seem to think that that is the way we
are supposed to be playing.  Unless there is some other way to kill them,
they *are* unkillable if we all played the way Verant wants.

So, when I say that I think their idea is that guilds are supposed to be
like mine, I'm not saying that a guild like mine can do the high end stuff,
even if every member were level 60 with maxed out AA and the best equipment
in every slot.  Rather, I'm saying that I think there is a lack of
communication between the people designing the high end content, and the
people designing/balancing classes.  The class design/balance people seem to
think we all have many useful roles on a raid, and so all classes are
welcome, and if they take away any particular ability, it won't gimp the
class.  The content people seem to know that some classes are more useful
than others, and seem to know all the tricks that the class people miss
(like rod2 -> infinite mana), and design the encounters for a focused guild
with top equipment using all the tricks.

What I think Verant should do is release some descriptions of how they see
fights going.  For each class, they should describe the role of that class
on the "typical" raid, and describe what that class does throughout the
course of the raid, with a fair amount of detail--what spells the casters
are using, and what disciplines the melees are using.
