Ask any GM and they will more than likely give you the wrong answer.

Basically, it's 3 hours if you're online (or on the same account on a
different character or on the character selection screen).  If you're
completely offline, I know it's at least 24 hours possibly longer.

One of our clerics stupidly camped in the FA spawn point in Sleeper's
Tomb.  He logged on the next day after the FA had popped.  He was
killed damn near instantly of course.  And of course, being the dumb
fuck he is, he didn't bank his key.

It was more than 3 hours before we got enough people online with keys
to go and kill the FA to rez his butt.  Fortunately, he was smart
enough to get on a different account to explain the "problem" to me.
