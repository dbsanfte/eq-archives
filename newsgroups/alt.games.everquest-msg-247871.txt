What'll really get your goat is that the plat selling company would have
given the guy another 100k in a heartbeat, and probably a bonus of more,
after he sent a complaint email and they checked the log from the transfer.

Nothing like sticking it to a dishonest and illegal industry like selling
plat!  Plus, since that plat didn't belong to the selling company anyway
(everything in EQ is SONY'S!!!), they would have had no recourse for their
agents own stupidity.
