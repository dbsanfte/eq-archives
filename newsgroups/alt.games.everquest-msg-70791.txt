Ah........ it's another one of those "you're so much more uber than us
that it should have been obvious" kind of things..... got it. (joking)

For the record, the person in our guild with the most Kael armor pieces
has four. But, of course, we all "S0xxors" and are "N00b5".

Really. I can see what you're saying, but not everyone can go kill a
bunch of dragons every day. I was just wondering. But your example above
is *NOT* typical of 95% of the eq population. Particulary the "Anyone
KNOW anyone whose main.." 

Yeah, Sang. I know some. Pretty much everyone I play with. Sometimes you
should remember that when talking to us noobs.
