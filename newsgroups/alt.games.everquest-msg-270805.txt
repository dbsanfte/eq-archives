Not to mention the fact that there may be a lower number of new players
coming in to EQLive.  If you're standing in front of a bunch of boxes at Wal
Mart and you know no better, will you pick up EQ Platinum or EQ2?  My guess
would be EQ2 based solely on the belief that newer must be better.

They did a wise thing in that regard including EQ2 in the All Access pass.
Sunscriptions may be holding steady, the actual online numbers are where the
rubber meets the road.  Those numbers would be interesting to see.  Too bad
they took the numbers away all those many moons ago.

CT is one of the original servers, I believe.  My guess is that the European
and PvP servers are hurting more than CT is, but that's just a guess.  Maybe
FV as well.

I haven't really been paying too much attention to it.  If I were in the
meeting room, I'd say wait until summer unless the decline continues.  But
I'm not privy to the actual numbers that someone in management sees on a
daily basis.  If I were, that might change my opinion. ;-)
