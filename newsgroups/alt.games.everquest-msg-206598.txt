Can anyone recommend any good guilds?

I have a 56 Necro, and a 53 monk among other chars.

I've heard that Glade Knights are good, and having checked them out, they do
appear to be good, but a little difficult to get in to.

Are there any other Euro, or better still UK based guilds that anyone could
recommend, or point me to a website of?

I'd appreciate any advice.
