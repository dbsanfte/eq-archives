That's definitely a design issue... You either design the game around 
quick travel, or you design it around slow travel. If the later (which 
I'd prefer), where you are determines where you fight, not the other way 
around, and getting there *is* part of the adventure.

Unfortunately, the way EQ was designed, with multiple races that require 
multiple starting points and a variety of zones of different levels for 
each race, it's obvious that the players will spread all over the world 
and expect to meet at pretty much arbitrary places at arbitrary times. 
The players now expect this and take it for granted.

If I were to design EQ from scratch, getting to Velious, for example, 
would be an adventure all of itself, and a considerable commitment of 
time, and all the zones in an area would have a much narrower range of 
levels, so that, for example, you'd move to Velious at level 30, leave 
at level 40, and spend those ten levels pretty much exploring every zone 
and dungeon in there. *then* you go to Taelosia or wherever next, and 
have little reason to go back to Velious, except maybe nostalgia or to 
help out a lowbie. Travel would be an integral part of the game, rather 
than a nuisance.
