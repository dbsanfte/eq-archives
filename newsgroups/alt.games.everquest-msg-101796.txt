I've actually been a little annoyed lately my 45 Shaman becomes a little 
redundant every time a Chanter joins the party. My normal role at this 
level is reduce resists, slow, debuff, and emergency heal. Chanter joins, 
and can pretty much do everything except the stat debuff. Makes a shaman 
kind of useless since in DL at least the mobs drop too fast for DoTs and 
drop fast enough that incapacitate doesn't make a huge difference. So, 
Shammies are left with stat buffs and hp buffs that stack with the cleric 
buffs. And 400hp nukes I guess.

Is this a level overlap thing? I hope when I get my 49 maloise spell it'll 
beat anything a chanter has?
