It doesn't matter who ended up 'owning' the virtual property involved at
all.  Regardless of who 'owns' the virtual property, the person who bought
it now has control over it and knew all the ramifications of that.

I can assure you, taking the money out of the register when nobody is
looking *is* stealing, no matter what the disposition or condition of the
shirt may be.

Call it "reversing the charges on his credit card" and the result is still
the same.  Of course, the credit card company will cooperate and investigate
and not allow the theft to be committed to begin with, once they find out
that the shirt is still under the control of the buyer.
