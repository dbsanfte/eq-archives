Hi Jazz, 
As James Grahame has posted it is because you are used to it.
The change in xp required from 53-54 is huge (as 54 is a Hell level)
However the difference between 54 and 55 is minimal (as 55 is also a
hell level)

If 53 takes 1 Day then 54 takes 1.6 days and 55 takes 1.7 days.
53 to 54 is a 60% jump in number of kills.
54 to 55 is only a 7% jump.

Plus my analysis is only raw xp numbers.
It does not take into account things like your new shinie /disc
defensive or new hunting grounds or even grouping or group structure.
Just raw numbers.

Note that the only other big jump is doing level 59 which is 37% more
than 58.
While the most "hellish" level is 51 120% *more* than 50 !

Heck I don't know the top end game, I don't play often enough.
I'm just pleased to be out of my first ever Hell having dinged 31 this
week.
(And to think that I had a level 15 char when you first posted here)
Ho hum,

Jim 
level 31 and feeling like dick waving, even if it is much smaller than
Jazz's :-(
