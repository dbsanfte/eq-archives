This ability has been killed... but even when it worked, he wouldn't
loot and hold the silks and hides for you.  Only cleric pets do that...
and I don't mean the Hammer

The key used to be to find mobs that would aggro on your pet, so
they would attack him and he would then respond and kill them.
The patch they are currently putting in place makes it so -no- mob
will ever aggro on a pet that isnt' already fighting.  I suppose it
will still be possible to find spots where adds come along frequently
enough that your pet will kill a long string of mobs off one "/pet attack"
command, or to find a spot where you can stand there and mobs will
aggro on you for your pet to pull off you and kill... but thats going to
add to the risk level and is going to prevent your "go off and get exp while
the pet farms greenies" plan.
