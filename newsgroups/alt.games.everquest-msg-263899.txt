   Well, I read it as Bring Booze For People, but that's probably  because
I just got off work and would really like a glass of wine right now.  
   As for the Mary's point (great title for a thread, btw) it sounds good
on paper, but the problem is as has been stated before, you would have no
control of just who would end up leaving.   And it's not just the jerks
that have changed things.  I remember running into my fair share in the
glory days.  Nope, the game was in its glory when it was fresh and new. 
The economies were way different, the hot spots to hunt have changed, at
least in the low to mid game, and of course travel has completely changed.

   I'm sure that there are many that would thing that EQ would be very hurt
if they ever turned back the clock.  And even if they did, they could never
turn us all into newbs again.
