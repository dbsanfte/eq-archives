You probably could, but unless you want to spend 20min in the EC tunnel
trying to sell them every time you get a pelt or two, you'll be
encumbered or out of bank space very quickly. Leather paddings are light
and stackable, pelts are heavy and unstackable. It's much easier to
build up a supply to sell in quantity with the paddings.

As for price, I see HQ cat pelts go for 2-3pp each on MT, bought by all
the people skilling up to 115 on quivers. No market for HQ wolf really,
and HQ Bear goes for 20pp each or so. I've sold paddings for 50pp/stack
(you could probably get more, but I usually just want rid of the
things), so you're getting about the same price as HQ cat, even if half
your stack is LQ wolf or MQ bear or whatever (OK, you have to find lots
of spiderlings). The only pelts  I wouldn't recommend skinning down are
HQ bear. Personally, I just do this for medium pelts since studded is
trivial for me now, its just a means to get some cash back from the
shoddier pelts when I'm looking for HQ ones.
