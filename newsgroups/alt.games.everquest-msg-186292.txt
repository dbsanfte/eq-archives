Oh no.  It's not just outrunning it.  If you hit a mob from far enough 
away (ie arrow pulling), it will run THE OTHER WAY after you, and show 
up ages later.  With many friends and relatives, sometimes.  But yes, 
the original story sounds like a classic case of not letting the mob 
keep you in sight.  OT is HORRIBLE with that.
