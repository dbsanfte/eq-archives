I wouldn't bother heading to North Ro, because you'd have trouble finding a
group after lvl 14, and don't even think about heading into Oasis. That zone
is a pain to hunt in, due to the wandering drybones skeletons and madmen
(the casting ones, anyway), plus the fact you have to watch out for SGs and
hope the Spectres be good while you're there.

Go to Paludal Caverns, like Darktyger suggested. If you don't have Luclin or
you can't find a group, move to Freeport and hunt Giant Spiders,Young
Kodiaks, Willowisps and Giant Beetles in East Commonlands. You should be
able to solo them fairly easy if you use your skellie pet. (Just make sure
you have a magical weapon before trying the Willowisps. They can't be hit
with non-magical weapons)

(If you get a port to WC, try to get one from a Wizard. As an SK, you might
be KoS at the Druid ring. Not sure about that, though)
