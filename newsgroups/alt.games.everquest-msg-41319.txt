You're both right.  On the one hand, revenge just leads to more revenge.
Ever see a pair of five-year-olds playing "Gotcha-Last"?  It gets faster and
faster, harder and harder, until one kid ends up on his butt, with mud all
over him, bawling his little head off.  Do you want to see the biggest,
baddest, mega-industrial, military and technological superpower in the world
start behaving like that?  Sure, the U.S. could nuke the turban-tied
fanatics into oblivion with no more effort than it would take you or me to
swat a fly, but we'd make enemies of half the world by doing it.  Plus our
grandkids would have three heads; radiation travels.

On the other hand, I detest the philosophy of "turn the other cheek."  If
you roll over when you get kicked, you're going to get kicked again, and
again, and again.  How many nosebleeds do you take before you cut loose with
a haymaker?
