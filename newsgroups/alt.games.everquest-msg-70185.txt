Roleplayah vs powergamah, chapter 368: Choosing a deity

For a human warrior, the choice with the fewest faction issues would be
Agnostic. Some people (the powergamahs) say that if your character has the
choice to be Agnostic, you should always take it, for this reason. I'm
guessing however you chose Rallos Zek - the god of War - to match your
warrior's warlike ways, which would make you more of a roleplayah.

If you want a deity, but not one that will get you in trouble, Karana is
fairly neutral (rain is rain, after all). Don't know if human warriors can
choose Karana though.

Oh, and *city* guards will tend *not* to leave you alone, however high level
you get.
