Where do you get this from? Its been a long long time since I
was of a level to use one but my memory is that until level 53
to 55 *nothing* of the non-extremely-uber variety will outdamage
a wurmslayer. Its all about ratio, the mainhand damage bonus
just doesnt significantly weight faster weapons until much
later in the day than 47.

I havent followed combat engine upgrades or weapons stats for a
long time (I got bored of it and went back to waddling around
pretending to be a duck), but I'd be surprised if the current
situation is significantly different.
