Keep trying.  If you swim/run along the walls of the holes you are trying to
jump up.  You will find that on two of the walls there are places that kind
of "pull" you out.  You have to hit them just right, takes some practice.

P.S.
  I have an iksar shaman alt, it might take you awhile to get the skulls, I
got lucky and two of the guys spawned really quick, just kill everything
around the square holes that drop you back into the water, they will
eventually spawn.
