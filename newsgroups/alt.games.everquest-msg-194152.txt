Regen?

Thats one HP every 6 seconds right?  As in 10 HP per minute
right?  As in one twist of Replentishment with no lute equipped
does three times this and in only 18 seconds?  As in one twist of
replentishment with my little newbie Lute of the Jharin
Apprentice does 6 times this in only 18 seconds?  As in sitting
down with replentishment on for a minute will do 25 times this
rate?  That regen?

I can't think how you could possibly consider taking regen one
before taking run one, or run two, or run 3.  After that
everything is pointless enough that that little bitty extra regen
provided by regen one two three might be worth doing as a
"greater of the various lamenesses" plan

Note, all this is, of course -for a bard-.  For a monk, rogue,
warrior, necro, or shaman, all the regen you can get is all
good.  I'd still go run 3 first though.
