Lol, there is some irony in my posting
that, but note that I did not flame, nor
say that the correct way to post was
x, y or z.  Simply that not snipping and
or top posting has caused flame wars and
that I've never seen one erupt because
someone snipped and bottom (or inter-
spersed) posted.

And now, having started the very thing
I was trying to help him avoid, I'll shut
up :)
