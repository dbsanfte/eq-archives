For you the best way is FP to BB and BB to FV then either get a sow and
invisible and follow the stream to ill omen or ask someone to show the
route along the zone wall which is a bit safer but more tedious.  Going to
OT is a waste of time for you for you have to go from there across either
the Frontier Mountains which at 18 are very dangerous or through Warsilk's
Woods and the Gob mines in Ill Omen which may be even worse.
