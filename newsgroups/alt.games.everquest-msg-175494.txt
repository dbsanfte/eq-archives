I know how to keep track of buffs... haste is just something I don't cast.

Celerity (best shamm haste for a long time) was such a crock of shit, theres
no way in hell I was keeping that up on a group all the time.  If you want
haste, you invite a chanter sorry!

I don't actively watch the shaman screen... I don't need to..  I can malo,
slow, canni, avater heal and nuke without looking at his screen or
keyboard.. so id miss the "wore off" message anyway.   Doesn't matter for
debuffs, the only time a slow is wearing off mid-fight is a raid, where the
sham screen gets more concentration anyway
