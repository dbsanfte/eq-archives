I am not sure if this has been discussed, but does anybody know if all of
your faction stays intact if you move a character to a different server? I
know that money and items are not transferred, but if what about faction. I
have started killing giants in Velious to build up Coldain and CoV faction,
so if I move servers will the strides I have made be reflected on the new
server?

Thanks for your help.
