I know, which is why I'm trying to figure out some ways you can identify those
people who -have- basic grouping skills before you head into an LDoN environment; a
very unpleasant place to learn about the failures of your fellow gamers.

The reason I mentioned the leader board was not as a measure of your worth, but
rather as a way to see how many LDoN groups the potential group member you are
looking at has been in.  If he's been in 20 groups then he's undoubtedly heard all
the basics explained more than once, and seen the results of not listening if he's
so inclined.  If he's been in 15 successful groups out of 20 then he's listened,
because you don't get a record that good without at least the basics.  If you think
75% is asking too much, heck, 50%.  Or 25%....
