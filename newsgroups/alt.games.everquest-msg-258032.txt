Oh good, this thread is taking a turn that might teach me something! :-)

From posts on other topics, I've gathered that attack-on-assist
is often considered undesirable, and I'm not entirely sure why,
at least at low-to-moderate levels.  With my 30-something monk,
I'm happy to have it turned on.  It means there's one less key
I have to hit to get started thwacking a mob when the puller
brings it into camp.  I realise there could be times when it's
important for the MT to establish agro before anyone else joins
the fray, but I just haven't seen any such situation coming up
for me yet.  Sure, I might get agro for a while, but it's not as
though a monk can't handle being beat upon.  And if *I* am MT
and someone else is pulling, then the sooner I start beating up
the pull, the better.

Similarly, if there are adds, and we're not worrying about CC
(i.e., just let the extras beat on the MT, and watch out in case
they get distracted by healing agro), then once the first mob
dies I want to be able to hit F# to retarget the MT and then hit
my /assist hotkey, and immediately be attacking the next mob.

There are plenty of times when I don't want to attack on assist,
but usually it's when the target is out of range anyway.  E.g.,
someone has targetted a guard and I'm /assisting so I can /con
the guard.  Or I'm getting a target for me to Pacify.  But these
are cases where I'm not rushed, so I just turn off attack manually.
It's when I do want to be attacking right away that I feel the
time is important.  (Not to mention avoiding the risk that I might
forget to turn on attack at all!)

For my wizard, I'll admit, I set my assist hotkey to include
/attack off.  But that's mostly because he almost never melees,
and I didn't like all the "target out of range" messages.  (If
he even has a weapon equipped at all. :-)  I think there may've
been one time when it caused a problem, like it was causing me
to autostand or something, but I forget.

Anyway, if someone could enlighten me as to why attack-on-assist
is bad, I'll think about retraining myself not to depend on it!
