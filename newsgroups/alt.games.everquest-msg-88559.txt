[ trimmed Velketor names -- never fought in it since it was revamped! ]
When I fought there it was just "Pit" and "Village", and never more
than 2 groups in zone (except low levels doing spiders that nobody
cared about) unless somebody was killing Bob or Velk...

On Bristlebane these are: King, Juggs, Ilis Jail (your LZO), D1, D2,
Zone-out (your Portal,UZO), Pyramid (your Nec/Guard, Necro), Iksar
Jail (your Nec Jail, Gang), Chef, 4-Door (your Crypt) or 4-Door/Emp
(if doing Emperor also, never seen anybody do just Emp), and Bar (Bar +
arm-guy who isn't in Chef).

In the old days D1/D2 were almost always separate, but with all the
60's doing XP these days, one group often handles both now (we just
call it as "Disco" in that case), and nobody seems to object.  Also
one group sometimes takes both Chef and Bar.  I haven't seen many AE
groups in there lately, but they used to sort of take over the whole
disco area, or the whole chef/bar area, or wander around near the
bridges, when I have seen them.

When we do D2 we sit in the room where the Iksar Necromancer spawns,
and pull the whole area up to the two golems.  For D1 we sit in the
side open area to the right as you enter (sort of near frenzied spawn,
but not in there).  If we're doing both we probably sit in D1 spot to
defend the camp, or in D2 spot if we're having trouble keeping up and
don't mind somebody leeching off D1.  I've seen other groups sit in
other spots though.

Doing 4-Door with a strong group that can handle all the way to
Emperor and back is really fun -- you are constantly on the move.  A
slightly weaker group does all that except the actual Emperor room.
4-Door alone would be very boring, but some just do that I guess
(mainly to camp for Heiro Cloak).
