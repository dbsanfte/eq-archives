So this morning I logged in to EQ with much anticipation over the new
Nektulos map. Sadly, the only char I had in the vicinity was a human
with no light source. In older content zones, not having a light source
was not as debilitating as it seems to be in the revamped zones - even
cranking the gamma way up does nothing to help see - so I never
bothered to carry one around anymore. As a result, I didn't see much of
anything but vague shapes and various skeletons rushing to attack me
from the gloom.

The orc camps were well lit enough I could make the new orc model out.
Apparently I'm not the only one who was reminded of Warcraft with the
new orc models. I kind of liked the Jay Leno look of the old orcs, and
would have preferred a more detailed version of that, myself. It helped
distinguish EQ orcs. Now, I'll always call out "Zug zug!" and ask orcs
near any bodies of water if they'd like to sing "Da bu gatchortka!"

I'll just add it to my list of gripes in models, a few notches below
turning gila monsters into six-legged mini Gino-Godzillas.

Xiphos - I did enjoy WarCraft II orcs. Doesn't mean I want them in EQ.
