Wow.  OK, yeah, these people are probably working at a Uni for a
reason, then ;)

Never been on a network with a proxy/firewall that blocked port 22, but
I could see where that would be an issue.

Yep. The major drawbck to using SSH tunelling. UDP-over-TCP wrappers
exist, but they're cumbersome.

Probably because most worthwhile network services, besides games, use
TCP over UDP :)

An excellent question.  Let me know how that goes for you, I'm curious
as to the answer.

I still suspect it would end up introducing far too much latency to be
useful for playing EQ, and there's still the issue of finding the
all-important external proxy host.  Perhaps the original poster could
set up a small proxy system at a friend or relatives abode? An old,
cheap AMD K6 or P-II should do nicely.
