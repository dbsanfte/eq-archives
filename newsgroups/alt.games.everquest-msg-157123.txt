Um... it's all over the place today.. :)

Just went to the one on 106th & Bway.  (10 minute walk) they hadn't even
opened the boxes yet (11:30pm) - bastards.

Wandered around the planes I could get to.  Essentially pretty boring.  But
I really don't have any agenda.  Next time I need to get from Qeynos to
Freeport I'm sure I'll find it more useful.  Not that I've really been in
either for the last 20 levels..  But granted they weren't the transportation
bus that the Nexus/Bazzar/Shadowhaven had been.

At least the portals go whenever you want them to... yay!
