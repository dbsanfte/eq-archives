Damn, spells are cheap on your server.  80K would barely cover Quiessence 
for me, Fo7 is 70k on a good day.  BoS is usually at least 40k, I have 
never seen FA for sale.  Even with Malo, I'd still spring for Malos, the 
difference is enough to matter, at least for raiding.  It's more like 30 
to 40k on Emarr though, Malo is still 20K at it's cheapest.
