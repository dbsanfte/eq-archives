Oops yeah Lake Of Ill Omen.  Why not just call it LIO, but anyway... 
Seemed like I was having trouble finding good mobs to kill around 22-25
when I was there with my enchanter ages ago.

Yeah, It's a good zone, but just too out of the way unless you are a
lizard. And it seems to me other zones are better, obviously paludal
until 24, and maybe even up to 27...

Hehe, well the two days I've been there, I've had to deal with other's
trains in the evening, even this morning there was a little train by
someone I must have missed as we zoned (I in, him out).

All I can say is unwrite it off!  Of course I'm having a pretty good
time by myself there, so maybeI should be saying - "Stay away!  It's too
dangerous! (because I'm training the zone all the time)
