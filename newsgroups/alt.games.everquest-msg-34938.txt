Yet one more retarded usenet Nostradamus predicting EQ down is all.
Figure if you proclaim every new product as EQ's downfall, sooner or
later you'll be right by sheer attrition.

I hate UO, but I can't say I await with glee for it to fail. In fact,
I could care less if it goes on for another 100 years. Sitting around
waiting for something to fail for your own pleasure is pathetic and
petty, usually done by people who have nothing going on in their lives
and resent other peoples success and receive pleasure when the
successful fall to their level.
