Your XP is a numeric value. The bar is only a representation. Any XP
change that isn't worth at least 1/10 of a blue (0.4% of a level)
won't show up in your bar.

So, you can kill a dark blue, then a light blue. If the light blue
puts you over a click and the dark blue does not, it will appear that
the light blue gave more XP.
