It is even worse than EQ. In EQ, things change with higher levels. Mob
power rises faster than player level, which gets you to learn new skills
and methods for hunting and playing your character.

In DAoC, PvE combat is EXACTLY THE SAME AT LEVEL ONE AS IT IS AT LEVEL
FIFTY. The only difference is that the numbers involved are proportionately
bigger. It is just as boring as it sounds.
