Hi

I got stuck in a small room with no exits when I logged in to Warrens.
After /petition and ï¿½ hour wait, a GM shows up and says:

"There you are you naughty monkey, the gods are angry with you."

What!? Okay, he summoned me out, fine, but what kind of tone is that?
I got stuck in a bug, I didnt do anything wrong!?

When I compliened about the bug to him (loss of time, food and water), he
asks me if I want to go back in the room and think it out!

What!? They put me in a bug, and next thing they threaten to put me back me
because I complain about it.

Is that experience common? I have screenshots of the whole story, if anybody
are interested.
