Rhand:

Brilliantly explained and *exactly* what I was looking for, so a mighty big
thank you is in order. Also, you did point out to me about hanging onto my
Int gear for Tradeskills, and I tell you what .. I wouldn't have given this
a second thought until it was too late, so thank you for that too ..

Safe hunting to you kind sir ..

Stevie
