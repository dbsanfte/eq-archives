No, this was the computer gamer magazine mis-interpreting a quote like
everyone else seems to be doing... Here's the quote:

"Basically, you can ride it, and move faster than you'd be able to on

faster than skilled players can travel, players on foot won't be
disadvantaged because all of a sudden monsters can run faster to make
up for horseback riding."
