Get in a low 30s group hunting Hill Giants in Rathe Mountains. The range of
coin they dropped for my group yesterday was 4 pp 40 pp, To a high of 55 pp
12 gp. The average loot dropped was about 30 pp. The bonus is at level 30
they will give great exp as well. They hit very hard, you need a balanced
group at this level. We were hunting with a 29 Mage, 30 Wizard, 30 Warrior,
31 Paladin, 32 Cleric, and a 33 Warrior. The battles were tough, but no one
died, not even when I pulled a Cyclops as well as the Hill Giant. Downtime
was probably a bit higher than it should be for an experience grind, but the
cash just can't be beat.

Suden, 30 warrior
