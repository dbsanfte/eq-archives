	The misconception here is not mine.  Leather Goddess asked the
question about money.  I merely answered it.  She is the one who framed the
discussion in terms of making money from hackery.  If that is the
contextual framework of the discussion, then I stand by my statement:
Anyone who can do the sort of hacking she describes is capable of making
money in a far more efficient manner than selling EQ accounts or items on
eBay.

	Let us do some simple math.

	The last time I heard any figures, there were roughly 200 million
people on the Internet.  And it's been some time since I heard any figures.

	We know from Verant's releases that approximately 350,000 people
have EQ accounts.  This means that 0.175% of the total Internet population
plays EQ.  

	To put it another way, if you were to grab 1000 Internet users at
random, 1 or 2 of them would play EQ.  The remaining 998-999 will not.

	If someone has performed the sort of high-level hackery we're
discussing, the odds are very much against them even finding someone who
plays EQ.

	This would require someone skilled enough to perform the sort of
high-level hackery we're discussing, and would require them to not only
find someone who's playing EQ through whatever server/router/switch they've
hacked but would *also* require them to find someone playing on EQ who is
on the same server they themselves play on.

	I cannot imagine the odds of this happening as being anything other
than infinitesimal.

	To get hundreds or thousands of passwords, they'd almost have to
hack the servers on EQ's side of things.

	In this respect we are in agreement.  No, I don't think that there
is any significant amount of hacking being done against EQ accounts via the
high-tech method we've described.  But I do think that there are a lot of
people who have been compromised via trojan programs and have lost their
passwords that way through no fault of their own.

	If their circumstance is anything like mine, they are probably
getting flooded with complaints about compromised accounts.  There are
probably a lot of bogus complaints about this, but there's probably a lot
of legitimate ones as well.  I can certainly understand their frustration
if their complaint queue mirrors the one at my job to any degree.

	Of course, that still doesn't mean they should punish the victims.
We don't.
