I can't help it. You don't call me a guy, and you don't send me
viruses disguised as docs. If you played a male character on EMarr I'd
probably marry you even if you were an ogre :)

Bread was removed with the plague, bread quest nerfed because SZ
showed its use in leveling, fillets and iksar smithing were nerfed
because SZ showed how useful the high prices were for getting funds,
bread baking never was a good money source and the recipe has been
broken for most of EQ's lifetime (and currently is broken again, I
believe)

There are many separate things involved here and he didn't get them
straight, but was convinced he knew the gospel truth. In so many
words, Burnt is an idiot :)
