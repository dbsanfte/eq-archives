Yes, thankfully...as half the mobs in DL see invis, the Z axis is considered
in aggro range it seems. If a mob did aggro/notice you, your height would
not be taken into account was what I meant.

One of the annoying bugs with Levitate was if you ran over a bridge while
levitating (Eg the one in Nektolus) then the piranha would aggro and attack
you thru the bridge...without levitate you were safe /shrug
