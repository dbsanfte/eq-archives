WoW beta is 5 months minimum.

So, if SOE manages to fix this stuff in the next 2 months, then offers
everyone who's stopped billing 3 months of free play - maybe they'll
get them back.

Personally I stop billing as soon as I pay for the month, so that I 
have to manually pay for the next month.  I think my cycle came up 
sometime in the last week and a half, but I wouldn't know because I sure
as hell am not logging into this shit.
