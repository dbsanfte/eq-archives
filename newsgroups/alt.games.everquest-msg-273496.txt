    35% of the accounts on my server have been cancelled since WoW. Our 
entire officer group save two left, and the two may still leave. Things are 
so bad, I've been asked to be an officer. Glad to hear things are going well 
on one of the few Euro-flagged servers, but on the many North American ones, 
it's not pretty.
