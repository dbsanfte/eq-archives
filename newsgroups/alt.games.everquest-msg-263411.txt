Power (and hp) regens as fast whether you sit or stand, but regen in
combat is slower, I think - I haven't really paid much attention
because fights are usually fast enough my regen makes very little
difference (much faster than in EQ1).

So there's no sitting around in combat, unless you want to, nor do you
need to be sitting after combat is over, you can move around and still
get full regen.
