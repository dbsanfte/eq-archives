Sea Furies are a decent spot for cash I've found, with gems up to 
sapphires, and the usual assortment of old world cash items, though you're 
probably looking for something a little faster.

The stalkers in PoN shouldn't be too hard for you to solo and drop a nice 
ammount of loot.  Easily harmonied as well.  I've seen lots of druids 
claiming the camp solo.

Dulak is a good place for cash drops, up to blue diamonds and a decent 
ammount of cash loots, though not a whole lot in terms of really valuable 
drops (nameds aren't too rare but the stuff they drop is in line with the 
difficulty of the zone).  It adds up quickly though.  This is where I'd 
head personally.
