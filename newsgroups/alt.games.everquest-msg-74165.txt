While fizzle is far from crippling in combat... because noone would
try a spell with a palable fizzle rate to it in a hairy situation... it would
be very helpful to have fizzle rate dropped while training a spell up,
as fizzles cost mana with no chance to raise skill.

Cut fizzle rate in half and you'd cut the time needed to raise a skill
up in half in some cases!

Unfortunately, I can attest to the fact that a higher character level
does nothing for ones fizzle rate, since I didn't start working on
conjuration until into my 40s, and I fizzled like a level one wizzard
while casting a simple summon food.  On the other hand, if this is
a misstatement, and actually raises the apparant skill level while
checking for fizzles by 15 (thats 3 levels worth of skill ups) or 30
(6 levels of skill ups) then it certainly would be worthwhile for
training purposes.

Also, I think if you look around, you will see some people complaning
that some of the new high end spells still fizzle a -lot- even with
200 skill... perhaps they are designed with a higher threshold
on purpose, to require use of this skill boost or a substantial waste
of time and mana.
