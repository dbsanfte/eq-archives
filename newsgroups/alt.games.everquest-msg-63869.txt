I just don't understand why Verant would say that Voodoo cards are supported
for Luclin when Voodoo is out of business.  Yet they don't officially
support my Hercules Prophet 4500 & Guillemot & Hercules are both still IN
business.  Despite not being officially supported, my graphics look
terrific.  But, then, changing from an ATI All-in-wonder with only 16M of
ram to a card with 64M would make a difference, huh?  :o)

Anyway, if someone could tell me what is different about the cards that
might encourage Verant to do this, I would appreciate it.  I'm not much in
the mood to go hunt down reviews & technical information about the Voodoo
cards.  I know my Hercules info pretty well (or, at least, well enough to
suit me for now).

Thanks
