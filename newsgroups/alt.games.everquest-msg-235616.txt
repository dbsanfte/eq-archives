Fascinating. I wonder if he's a Robert Heinlein fan.

To play the devil's advocate though...

What makes him a nut? Its really not even that "out there" as far as
personal utopias go.

In fact the only real red-flag is the implicit placement of himself at
the apex of the hierarchy... but that is somewhat inevitable too...
you can't exactly "lead"  if you cede your position as "leader".

The sexual issues... are certainly abnormal by mainstream societal
standards, but common in nature, human history, and even modern
sub-cultures. 

Hell even mainstream society contains an ample share of multiple
partners... infidelity is as common as smog, and is tacitly approved
of... (sure Clinton was challenged on it... but the greater population
really didn't care...)
