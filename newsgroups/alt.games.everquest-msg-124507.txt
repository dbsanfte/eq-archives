Again, it's a matter of perspective. Looking down from UberHeights (TM)
it might not seem like much. But to me (and my guild at large) a 3K or
10K sale item is definitely a "big cash" loot item. Also, as far as NoS
goes, we don't/can't kill any WW dragons. Even the "wussy Yeldema". So a
Necklace of Superiority would be a wearable upgrade for many of us, or
again, a damn fine sale to other people on the server who can't do ToV
or WW dragons.

Hell.. we got fucking smoked by VS last night.
/sigh

So yes, Virginia, Howling Stones can be like raiding Santa's workshop
for some guilds.
