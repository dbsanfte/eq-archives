A long time ago I played an online RPG (text-based) similar to EQ in
principle.  They had what they called "Guild Masters" which were the
representative for a class.  They were chosen through an election of their
class.  They were given special amenities due to their status.  Perhaps
something like this is what's needed in EQ.
