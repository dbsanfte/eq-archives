Acumen Mask (Quest in Sol Ro Temple)
Staff of the Wheel (All over, a fun quest :)
Polished Bone Bracelets (Dropped in Gorge of King Xorbb by named beholders)
Impskin Gloves (Sol A)
Staff of Temperate Flux (Another Sol Ro Temple quest)

Take a look at these. Some you should be able to do now/soon, others in a
little while, others in 20 levels :)
