Yes, but a crusader isn't yet 20 (because then they'd be a paladin or
shadowknight) and could join AQ1 groups before the gnolls go grey, at
least at level 18, not sure the ones you have to kill first would
still be green at 19, but the tormentors and elders certainly aren't
grey to any crusader.  I admit I could have been a bit more clear on
that, since a paladin or shadowknight is still also a crusader.
