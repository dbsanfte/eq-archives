And so what if you DID start a newsgroup about your hatred of them?  For
anyone to complain about them being available as opposed to just not reading
them is a pathetic fool.

London Transport is only public if you are in London, but that doesnt make
it any less public.
Why dont you just take your own action, ie not reading the offending
newsgroup, as opposed to wanting Cox to take action and depriving other Cox
users of a newsgroup that they read?

What is it you feel he thinks he is entitled to?
