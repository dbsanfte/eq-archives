Bastard ! i want that very large coin purse but we never kill yelinak :(

I carry more bags than you do though.
dusty ransackers
tiny coin purse
kavrulls mystical pouch
treasure hunters satchel
2 tinker sacks

You must not carry around the bag-o-items bags .

Incidently for young monks I highly recommend hunting grimlings . The fact
that they drop runes that sell for cash instead of cash itself is incredibly
usefull. I made several hundred plat easily not getting overweight just
hunting for a tinker sack full of small acrylia blocks.
