Druids get both Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Cheetah; but SoC is pretty
useless with that 12 min. recast and 45 sec. duration. The only time I
ever bothered to keep it memmed was when I was hunting in EW a lot in my
early 30s. Those damn snow griffins can easily outrun SoW. =) I do,
however, occasionally use Scale of Wolf for long trips when I'm not
planning to fight; it saves a little time.
