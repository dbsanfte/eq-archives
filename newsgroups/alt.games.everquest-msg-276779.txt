That's like owning a 2004 Porsche 911 Turbo and telling the masses he 
doesn't consider it a high end car. "Its 2005 don't ya know."

I'll tell you a secret... ALL of last years supercars will still blow 
away 99.9% of this years fleet. Yep all those 2005 Toyotas, Hondas, 
Fords, & Chevy's are not faster than 2004 911s, nevermind 911 turbos. 
The same is true for that $500 Dell PCI-Ex16 machine...Beleive it or not 
it would be a serious downgrade for you. ;)

/sigh 

We're looking at single digits in actual performance improvments there. 
Probably small single digits.

Sure. 2nd place is the first loser. =)

A midrange system being a generic Pentium 4 2.0GHz system with 1GB of 
RAM and a half decent video card... even an nvidia geforce ti4600 would 
be more than adequate for 2xEQ. I'm sure people out there do it with 
even less.

PS I didn't find it germane to include brands, makes, and model numbers 
of the cooling fans and motherboard screws. Rest assured that it will 
need both though. ;)

(PPS Just poking a little fun, don't take it personally.)
