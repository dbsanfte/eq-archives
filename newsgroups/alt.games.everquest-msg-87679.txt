I would suggest 4 iksar characters. Resons why:

1. All of you get regen. Huge downtime reducer.
2. Kunark rocks and you can level to 60 there without leaving. Lots of places to play.
3. Don't need a porter since cabilis is centrally loacted.
4. Iksar newbies zones and starting quests are awesome.
5. Yes you will be KoS to most old world places but you can
easily adventure in Velious and Luclin if you get sick of Kunark.

I would suggest Monk, Shaman, Necro, Beastlord.

All of these require chain armor or less, so the plate
restriction of the iksar race is not an issue.
