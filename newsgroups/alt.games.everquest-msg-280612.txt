Can be a lot of things: 
e.g. Company Insiders who don't wish to be fired.

Its possible to be credible and remain anonymous, especially if he 
doesn't just automatically post any number that some crack head submits 
via yahoo.

> Educated Guesses

Operative word being educated. Not stuff out of a magic 8-ball.

Given that few, if any mmogs present their numbers on demand. This is 
life. Educated guesses means indirect info... like working backwards 
from financials (revenue, etc). You can easily put a game in the right 
ballpark from good financials.

If you actually read the analysis he specifies which titles are guesses. 
EQ, EQ2.

If you can provide even slightly better info go for it.
