That is one benefit of writing an actual "program"
rather than a bunch of shell goodness.  For what you
want to do, the Perl compilers will be exactly what's
needed.  Plus, they have the benefit of not allowing
the Perl "gurus" to see your code and make fun of
you (I've been the target of that before!) :^)  "What
a n00b -- he used $| when he could have used <blah>
<blah> <blah> which would have been more 00ber!" hehehe

Anyway, sounds like a fun and easy project for you
to brush-up on your skills and I'm sure that people
would find it useful.  Go for it!

Mike
