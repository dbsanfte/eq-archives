Well, some places less so than others. For example, everyone starts out
non-KOS to dervs, beta-neutral and some other bizarre factions, so my
Ikkie SK could shop at Murissa Sandwhisper in North Ro, Katha
Firespinner in EC, druid ring vendors etc.

Also started out as dubious to Bloodsabers, so he can run around the
Qeynos tunnels with impunity and use the bank, just can't use the
vendors. And it only took *minor* faction work to get golden with the
evil trainers and vendors under Freeport (although some DE cleric still
wants to kill me).

I would imagine its easier getting non-KOS in Neriak and Grobb than in
light towns, since they'll be less disgusted with you worshipping
Cazic-Thule.
