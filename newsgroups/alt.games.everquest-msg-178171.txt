I have A PPPoE DSL connection (I need to log in and my IP is dynamic) and
have the login information in a DSL Router/Switch.

DSL Phone Line plugs into DSL Modem (External)...
Modem Ethernet plugs into DSL Router/Switch...
Each port's Ethernet cable then plug into each PC (up to 4).

For me, my DSL Router maintains my ISP login credentials and each PC only
needs to have DHCP enabled and TCP/IP loaded.

There are other ways of doing this, this happens to be what fits my needs.
