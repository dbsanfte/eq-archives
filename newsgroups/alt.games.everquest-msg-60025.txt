Heck, I got nathsar sleeves last night and am debating whether or not
to semi-permanently ditch my shroud of nature (leather straps) for my
gnomeskin tunic (black) until I get a stat tunic that doesn't have the
leather look to go with the sleeves...

Female wood elf leather tunic + any kind of non-plain leather  visible
sleeve = unsightly. (Leather sleeves are just bands around the upper
arm so they're ok with the strap tunic)
