> How many druids have this spell? I cant find it.

My druid has all the spells but frost . He cant cast them being 55 but he
has them . Most of the high level ones come from killing
gorenaire/talendor/severious/trakannon. Reet frogs and juggs are really good
for the middle ones . Some of the ones that seem to be middle ones are in
actuality high ones and come off only 60th or higher mobs. The easiest mobs
to get high level spells from are the emperor in sebilis and queeny in
charsis . Dragons do tend to drop 4 or so every time though while the easy
60s seem to drop 1 every other time. You cannot solo for the spells however
. If you are a soloer you will need to buy or trade for them.
