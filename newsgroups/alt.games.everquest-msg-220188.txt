What about an easily kiteable mob that hits for 500?

Easy for kiters/rotters, but very difficult for folks who
have to stand toe to toe with it.

What about summoning mobs that hit for barely over 100 (see
the Massive Constructs in the Hole)  Easy for tank/pet classes
to take, near impossible for folks who rot.

Sorry, but mobs don't have a consistent difficulty across 
classes, and therefore no single difficulty modifier for the
mob works.
