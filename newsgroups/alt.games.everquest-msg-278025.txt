What always boggles me is that apparently there are people able
and willing to pay those prices!  I scrape up my plat from hunting
and/or playing the market in the bazaar, and every once in a while
I've spent as much as 50-70K for a single piece of gear that I knew
I'd use for a long time (e.g., fungi), but I blanch every time I see
tradeskill components at 700 each and realise I'd need about 500 of
them to train up that stretch of the tradeskill, and often the items
I'd be making won't even sell for much.

Where do people come up with millions of plat to throw around?  Do
people make 10K per session at the top levels, or is it just that
folks who've played for 6+ years have accumulated a lot of plat, or
what?  (I'll give y'all the benefit of the doubt and assume you're
not buying it from IGE. :-)
