... I don't think I will do that ...
I have some characters.. in their teens, but okay.. it's just better than
starting over without other characters..
and have some pretty cool items given to me from higher level characters..
but .. I create a new character when I have played my previous to level 10
or so.. (don't know why.. guess feel like trying another class/race).
I have never given the decent equipment that my other characters had to this
new one..

I think it's just the whole growing process of a character that is nice.. so
'reaching 20 as fast as possible' isn't my goal.
I love every level that my character has to offer.. even without some decent
equipment.. then I have to work for it and appreciate it.

by the way.. my friends call me nuts when I tell them this if they want to
twink me *grin*
