I didn't have enough memory when I installed SoL, so opted for the fewest
models and only the old textures. I've upgraded since then, and am going to
upgrade some more after Christmas, and I'd like to add the textures/models I
opted out of. I haven't seen an option for that though and was wondering if
anyone knew how to change it?

thanks.
