69 spells drop in pairs off of minis from NC off of mobs that can be
done with 2 groups.  Get your guild to help you.

Also - just like warriors and knights can't get the best weapons
without killing things, this makes it so that casters can't get the
best spells without killing things.

In most cases, the L70 spells are only group versions of other Omens'
spells.  So if you only group, you don't really need them.

If you raid a lot, it won't take much for your guild to help you get
your spells.

I myself don't have any L70 spells yet (L70 enc) and all but one of my
L69 spells.  I've been an applicant into a guild for over a month, and
soon to be a full member.  At that time, I'll have my turn at the
spell runes when we do MPG trials (they always drop 2 Glowing runes)
