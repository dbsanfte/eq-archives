Doubt that would be a good idea. Several quests involve giving GP to people (the
Shakey Scarecrow quest in Rivervale, the Testament of Venaer, probably more).
Since the idea of the loot splitting would remove gp from peoples money stash,
you could risk that you have to run to bank again. Wouldnt bother me as a druid,
can just port to Misty, but i will guarantee you that if some good race get a
few gp to little to give to the quest NPC in Feerott you will be able to hear
the scream all over Norrath. I dont even have an idea where the nearest bank to
Feerott that good players can use it.
