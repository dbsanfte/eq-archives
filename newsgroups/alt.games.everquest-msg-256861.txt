The 200 stats cap dates back to when 60 was the max level in the game,
this increased to 255 with lvl 65.  This can be further increased to
305 with PP AA's & to 355 with IE AA's.

Once you get over 200 the formula for calculating the mana benefit of
int changes & I've always used the benchmark of 6 mana per int.  With
the availability of decent quality gear & augs from LDON maintaining a
355 int lvl is not too tricky, enabling you to concentrate on HP's.

With the introduction of a numeric value on your mana as well as HP's
now it should be a lot easier to assess the value of an int item over
a +mana one.
