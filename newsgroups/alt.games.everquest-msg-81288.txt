Wolfie brings up some good points, which we are already discussing and
debating this morning in our guild. I have some ideas and questions as
well. (Don't I always? ;-p)

See, now *this* is how I read it. I interpreted it to mean that turning
in the pearl to the first merchant got you a swirling pearl and nothing
more. Nice that you then will never have to start the quest over, but
you're far from done as I read it. I assumed the two were totally
independent of each other, and you and your tracker would then have to
start the long wait for the random killable version to show up. However,
others in our group are saying it means that when you turn in the pearl
and get the new one, a killable version will spawn *someplace in Sol B*
immediately. If that's true, then in theory you could have two Zordaks
up at once if you turned in just after the random one spawned.

Here's my theory: This smells suspiciously like the triggered Feydedar.
I'm betting that when a triggered Zordakulus Ragefire dragon spawns,
he's going to drop that heart container, and THAT'S ALL. If he drops
Naggy's loot table, and can be attacked by post 52 players, he's going
to have the life expectancy of Hadden in Q. Hills.  I bet he only drops
the cleric epic piece.

I agree. This is a danger they may not have forseen. Even if he only
drops the heart container, any guild with the guns would likely take him
down and make sure all their clerics have the box to be ready for the
day that they can do the Chardok King.

Well, very possibly true. We'll have to do it a few times to see how it
actually works. (And our guild will, trust me.) But the "no more
starting over" part is still a nice boon for the clerics, given what a
PITA some of those earlier camps are. (/rude Lord Grimblox or whatever
his fucking name was.)
