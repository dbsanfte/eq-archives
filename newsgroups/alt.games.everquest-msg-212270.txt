You may be using some form of the word "Scales" I'm not familiar with, but by my
definition it doesn't scale at all.

At level one, a troll with 100 hp takes 60% of his HP in damage, sits down and
regens the damage in 10 tics, while a non troll would take 30 tics for the same
feat. At level 30, the same troll with 1000 HP sits down and regenerates his same
60% damage in 100 tics.  If the regen scaled up perfectly, he'd regen the damage
in 10 tics just as before.  Now we don't expect things to scale perfectly, as we
level up it generally takes longer and longer to regen... but look at mana regen.
Medding at low levels is good for a couple mana per tic, while medding at high
levels is good for 20+ mana per tic; this may not keep pace with the rate at which
your mana pool refreshes, but it at least makes the effort.

Further, as the troll shaman levels up, he gets access to regen spells; one regens
2 hp per tic, the next 6 hp per tic, the next 12 hp per tic (note I'm not using
the actual numbers since that would mean looking stuff up).  OK, compare the troll
shaman to a non troll at the level right before they get the first regen spell;
troll is regenning HP at 3 times the rate of the non troll.  One level though, and
the troll is getting only twice the regen the non troll has.  Get to the next
spell and now the troll is getting 12 hp per tic while the non troll is getting 8
hp per tic, he's only getting half again what the non troll is.  Next spell level,
he's getting 18 to the non troll's 14, victim of a rapidly declining advantage.
This is what I mean by "it doesn't scale"... it doesn't keep up with everything
else thats going on.

To compare, lets take a look at "not getting stunned on frontal attacks."  Lets
say for the sake of arguement that our test shamen always play MA.  And lets
further say that all mobs stun at the same rate, once per 20 seconds, regardless
of level.  Lets say that at level one the shaman does 1 DPS, at level 10 he does
10 DPS, at 50 he does 50 DPS and so forth (patently false, but shaman output does
scale up as he levels up).  We'll say a stun counts for 4 seconds of DPS on
average.  OK, the troll loses 4 damage every 20 seconds at level one, 40 damage
every 20 seconds at level 10, 200 damage every 20 seconds at level 50.. all
compared to the ogre shaman who, being immune, is losing nothing.  Ogre "not
getting stunned" ability is scaling perfectly

My example was artificially constructed to demonstrate what I mean by perfect
scaling, so its unmarred by the fact that mobs tend not to stun at low levels and
stun more and more as you level up (meaning that the ability scales in reverse,
getting better as you level up) or the fact that shaman MA less at the highest end
of the scale (which would mean it -doesn't- scale, becoming less useful as you
level up) or the fact that shaman damage output doesnt' work like that nor that I
don't really know what stuns average out to in terms of impacting DPS or other
types of spell output... a real examination of what the stunproof ability does at
various levels would be interesting but I don't have actual experience with ogre
shaman versus non ogre shaman, nor any kind of ogre to speak of (a level 6
shadowknight I think...)  It does look to me as a 51 troll shaman that I spend
enough time in front of mobs still that the ability would be a pretty nice boost.
