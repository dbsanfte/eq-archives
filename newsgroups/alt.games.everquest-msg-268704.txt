Bleh. If I win the lotto, I shouldn't be under some moral obligation
to give it to someone else, just because my class can't use it. Maybe
I have another character that can. Maybe I need money and want to sell
it. Maybe I just want to  stick it in a bag and leave it there.

I have no problem with someone saying, "hey can I buy that <insert
drop here> that you just got?" But alot of people demand it.

At first I didn't mind, but I noticed that I wasn't getting hardly
anything as a result of my generosity. And with mage books being as
rare as they are and often not being the only mage in a group, I never
had someone give me something they got and I could use.

Bottom line is I gotta look out for me first because noone else is. If
it's not an inconvenience or burden, I'm happy to help out someone
else, even complete strangers, but I'm not in the business of donating
my limited free time to the benefit of others. My priorities are first
me, then RL friends, then guildmates, then everyone else.
