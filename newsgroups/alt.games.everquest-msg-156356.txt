Take it from a 58.75 mage - something had to be done abut T-rods.
With dedicated healing (always available to me, 'bot cleric while
"soloing" and our regular group has him and a 60 druid friend)
you have mana regen in excess of 100per tick.

Now we are afraid of them nerfing Canni-petting however. 
Previous to PoP it had it's drawbacks (all equipment and
gear on pet poofs).  But at 64 mages can get the 2nd level of
suspend companion, that puts their pet in storage with all
it's gear and buffs.  Rumors on the BL forum say that you
can then summon a separate pet.  So, once again, mages will
have unrestricted access to 80+ per tick mana regen.  

Spec Conj 200 + enshrouded veil makes 49 earth pet
cost 150mana.  The summoned focus ring makes the cast
take 8.5 seconds.  Reclaim energy (from one of the Sol
Ro. focus items) is instant cast and returns 1/10th
the hp of the pet as mana.  Since a 49 earth has 2630
hp, this returns 263 mana.

So, with no AA's (and lots of malachite) and a 1200pp
item a mage can canni 2 pets every 3ticks, for 226 
mana every 3 ticks, or 75mana per tick.  4per
tick from TPP, and 5.2 per tick from new t-rods,
plus 1 standing regen = 85.2 regen (out of combat).

Now add in AA - SCM 3 increase mana return to 133
per pet, or 266/3 per tick (88).  Quick summoning
3 reduces cast time to 5 seconds - boosting regen
to 133 per tick.  Elemental pact removes the malachite
cost.  Or about 143 mana per tick standing regen
(out of combat).  

Right now, I use 57 earth pet to take things, with
my cleric to heal him.  With full buffs and summoned
gear he has 4k hp, and can easily take a dark blue
Shissar Revenant with almost half of it's HP left.  
I can't canni-pet, because I'd lose too much mana
investment in the pet itself.  With the new summoned
weapons on test (pet only we think) this is going
to be even more true.  Epic mages have the same
problem, as the recast on the orb is 5minutes and
then you have to let it re-DS itself. This is an 
adequate balance to canni-petting to make it not 
worth nerfing.  If, however, I can suspend the buffed 
up pet, and canni other pets to regen mana, then 
pop him back out ready to go - then canni pet might 
be in line for the nerf bat.
