Okay, got a problem.  Working on teh Beastlord handwarps quest for my kitty.
Was doing teh combien with the rockhopper legs and THOUGHT i had mad a
successful combine.  Turned those gloves and cloak into Animist Poren and he
told me head no use for this and gave me the gloves back BUT NO CLOAK.  I
used the wrong gloves.

SO, now I need a new initiates cloak but can't seem to get the quest started
again.  I had considered destroying the acrilya slate....but leery about it

Any thoughts?

Thanks
