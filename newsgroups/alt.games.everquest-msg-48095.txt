And since you're so smart why not take five minutes and find that post
bizbee claims I've made.
You know the one where I post the same thing as bizbee's anonymously posting
stalker.

You can't, because there isn't a one.
I'll just re-post for you what I said yesterday and you take it from there.

Any *moron* looking at Google can see you've got a *history* (a long one) of
anonymous posters stalking you on Usenet, Ron. From *cooking* newsgroups,
to *hiking* newsgroups, and even here in our EverQuest newsgroup. Did you
have an anonymously posting stalker when you posted to the Ultima Online
newsgroups too, Ron?

Strange that out of the millions of people who use Usenet everyday, you seem
to be very special, a man alone, with a reoccurring theme of anonymously
posting "stalkers".

I think you've "gone to the well" one time to many, Ron.
*You* posted this again didn't you, Ron?
*You're* the person, who posted this crap originally, aren't you Ron?
"brilliant" is what you called it, wasn't it, Ron?
*You've* been anonymously "stalking" *yourself* for years haven't you, Ron?
