Necromancers, Wizards, Magicians and Enchanters, at level 12.
Clerics, Druids and Shaman at level 14.

Druids, Clerics and Shaman aren't considered pure casters because they're
classed as priests, mostly since they're the classes with the best direct
heals.  Paladins, Rangers, Beastlords, Necromancers and Shadowknights get
heals, but they get far inferior heals compared to equivalent level Clerics
Druids and Shaman, and in the case of Necromancers and Shadowknights, their
heals come with a major downside.
