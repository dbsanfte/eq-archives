Not at all. I freely admitted that I was being facetious, and that I'd taken
your comment to ridiculous extremes. I didn't accuse you of perpetrating
these extremes, but every time someone tells my friend to lose the
ghoulebane he spent weeks questing in favour of some bazaar crap I have to
wonder what these people think the point of playing at all is...  I'll grant
that he could be using better than ghoulbane... but that's not the point. He
worked his ass off for it, getting each piece on his own, or in small groups
 his level...

The trouble is, those ridiculous extremes *are* manifesting in the game, as
the twit enchanter I encountered demonstrates.(And he's not an isolated
case.) Fortunately players like that are not the norm, and hopefully the
community isn't *so* obsessed with fast easy levelling that it becomes the
norm.

Once you expect your groupmates to be obtaining all their gear in the bazaar
from hi-levelers is it really that great a stretch to expect them to join
the group buffed by a few hi-levs in pok... after all those buffs *do* make
a world of difference in terms of your effeciveness, and they really aren't
that hard to get... anyone could 'reasonably manage it'.

Because shopping the bazaar for common 60+ level drops and hi-lev buffs *is*
the best equipped I can be, and it is reasonably easy to manage doing it.

It really wasn't directed *at you* ... though it was in response to your
comment. It was really directed at that enc...more than anybody. I agree
that when you group you should do your best... but that doesn't mean the
group gets to dictate what you do, nor do you 'owe' it to them to shop at
the bazaar. You owe the integrity of your vision of your character more.

Yeah. It was a bad list. Although double mentioning kei isn't entirely
unfounded either... ;)
