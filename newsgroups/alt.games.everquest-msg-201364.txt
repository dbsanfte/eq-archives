Noo-o-o. That's the trap. By the time you finish book six, you've read
about 5500 pages and it's very hard to put them down, even knowing how
ponderous it's going to be to get through the next four books.

A friend and I are both reading the Wheel of Time series. Whenever we
discuss it, it's to complain about it or mock some of the more
repetitive parts ("Woolhead," she scowled, crossing her arms under her
breasts.) But, we still trudge on in the desperate hope that, one day,
Robert Jordan will get an editor.
