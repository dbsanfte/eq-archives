	Reds will not work.  Snares won't stick to them often enough and you can't
hit them.

	Yellows can work out.  When I was level 22-25 I spent a lot of time
bowkiting Werewolves, mainly in West Commonlands.  These guys were (rarely)
blue to (usually) white to me.  One day whilst crossing West Karana I picked
up Mr. Furry on track and pulled him, then /conned...yellow.  I didn't know
until then that Werewolves in WK went to 11 ;-).  I made the kill, though it
was a close fight as I ran out of arrows before he turned.  I only fought
three yellow-con Werewolves during this period and I lost to one of them.

	It took a loooong time to bowkite a Werewolf down to a point where I could
safely melee it, and even longer to heal/med up afterwards and (especially)
replace the arrows.  I was (and am) a skilled Fletcher (skill 203 now, 175-200
during the period in question) so I was able to carry extra parts and make
arrows myself, rather than having to run to a vendor that sold them (which
were and are few and far between).  I was also using a good bow during all
this time; at first a Trueshot I'd made myself and later a Shaped Darkwood
Compound (ditto).  It was really a pretty marginal activity, but Werewolves
were worth it because they could drop rare pelts and claws, which could be
used to make some armor items that were nice at the time (and are now junk).
In nearly 30 kills I only got two pelts, but my gross take on them was 1100
platinum, and this was in the fall of '99 so that was really a lot of coins.
Most of the time, bowkiting was limited to firing a few arrows at my pull as I
dragged it someplace safe to be fought.

	Past this level, bowkiting is a despairation tactic.  I've won some fights
I would have lost by breaking off and bowkiting, but it would be insane to try
to level by bowkiting.

	As Rangers now get Panic Animal at level 22, you can instead fearkite your
way into the mid-50s with little or no risk, so I'd say bowkiting is really a
total loss these days.
