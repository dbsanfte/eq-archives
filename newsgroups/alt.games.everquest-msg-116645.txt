As are the Lizardmen and Basilisks.  Best way to deal with somebody
rudely rotting HGs up on top of the hill (or a bard kiting around on top
of the hill trying to monopolize the spawns):
1) stop killing PHs,
2) wait until the hilltop is nice and full of weak PHs,
3) go on a mad PH slaughter fest, killing them as fast as possible,
4) wait about 8 minutes or so for the "/ooc donating for a rez"
Doesn't work every time, but you often get many HGs spawning in a very
short period of time, and neither Selo's nor FD can save your ass if
you're being stunned repeatedly by half-a-dozen newly spawned HGs who
are out looking for somebody to hate.  Note that there is no training
involved, just a bit of spawn management to help some of your fellow
gamers to learn a lesson in caution and courtesy.
