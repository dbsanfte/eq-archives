The entirety of gameplay needs to be considered when judging an
MMORPG, not just the individual experience. This is why things like
gold duping and other exploits are bad for the game, even if they
don't personally affect you. Likewise, power levelling and other means
of twinking out newbies undermines all game balance, resulting in
power inflation, resulting in the company trying to continually
rebalance a "live" game, resulting in, ultimately, a bad game.

By preventing power levelling, game balance is preserved, making the
game a better experience for all, in the long term. I view money spent
on MMOPRG as a long-term investment in gameplay.  I want the game to
be good a year from now, five years from now, not a massive twinkfest
where people don't think the game even begins until they're level 60.

As for whose money is "better", that's for SOE to decide, eh wot? They
have a vested interest in encouraging long-term play -- it's a monthly
subscribtion, after all. Thus, they will usually choose to bias the
game towards slow development and balance, as opposed to massive power
levelling. (IMO, the game is still too fast -- if I had ten million
bucks to spend on MMORPG development, I'd design it so that max level
wouldn't occur for a good year after launch. Then I'd give the "You
Have NO LIFE!" award to the person who hit it first. But that's just
me.)

I swear, the simplest thing to do would just have two buttons on the
start up screen. One reads "Mak3 m3 ubr!!!!!", and immediately makes
your character 50th level with the best gear in the game. The second
reads "Pwnz teh b055!!!!", and, when you press it, it pops up a dialog
which reads "You have just beaten the biggest, baddest, nastiest thing
in the game! You have won! You are better than everyone else! You may
even get laid sometime in the next five years!". Then it erases the
game from your hard disk.

This setup would, I think, satisfy a certain subset of the audience.

The argument that, in a social game, individual playing choices have
no impact on others is foolish, and the argument that those impacted
should not express their opinions -- or support policies which limit
the behaviour they don't like -- is equally foolish. Nearly every
action you take is going to impact someone else in a game like EQ, and
if that impact causes them to decide to find a better game, SOE loses
money -- and SOE doesn't like to lose money. Thus, look for more, not
fewer, restrictions on the way you can undermine the game for your
benefit and other people's detriment. Look for me to not feel
especially sorry for you when it happens.
