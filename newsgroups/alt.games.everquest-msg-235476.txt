Ok, I was exaggerating a bit. Sometimes my twist goes down. Be it bad
timing or lag, or a very confusing situation. I do "twist" 2 songs when
one of these songs is needed. For instance resistances during a dragon
fight. And we get adds or something unexpected makes me drop my twist.
Then I start with 2 songs and wait till I get them both running
smoothly. Afterwards I twist the 3rd Song when I feel like I can manage
it. I'm just not comfortable with the idea that the resistance song
could drop any moment. :P
Besides that I can't see a situation where I have to twist only 2 songs.

P.S.: Expressing yourself in a foreign language is quite a bit harder
than reading it. I hope my explanation makes sense. :)
