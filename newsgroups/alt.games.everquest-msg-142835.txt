}Really.  But I think it might be nice if you all were to find your _own_

Bah, I have my own style.  But an arrow sig is a handy place to put that 
one last /em-ish comment.  But in the interests of making it my own style, 
I'm gonna stop putting my name on that line, since it's right below in my 
standard .sig, and point the arrow the other way.  HaHAH!  How bout that?

}Because really, I'm pathetic in loads of ways.

Don't believe you.

}Now, I'm not telling anyone _not_ to do arrow sigs (that's Jazz's
}job).  But do we all really want a.g.e turn into "that weird arrow-sig
}group"?

Yes.

}Annie <--- Hopes she's not throwing a sniffer of brandy on the fire.

Snifter.
