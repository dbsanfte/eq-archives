If you are planning on going to very high levels in a four person group,
then I suggest the following

Enchanter - Mez, Clarity, Haste, and Slow make this guy very important

Cleric - Rez, CH, and Cel Healing/Elixir make this guy huge also, dying
won't be such a big deal

Warrior - Most efficient CHs, defensive, nice damage also

Wizard - Pure damage, snare, teleports, evacs, stuns

I can't think of a better combination for a group of four always together.
They also serve as the core of a group, any other class (or two) will
complement this group.
