I could imagine adding an FAQ about how tribute works.  It could
even include the key (alt-U by default) for accessing it away
from the tribute master.

More generally, though, note that you can find ALL the "keyboard codes"
by opening your Options window to the Keys tab.  (Tribute Window toggle
is under UI keys.)  I highly recommend skimming the list of features in
the Keys options just to see what's available; you may find many other
features that you didn't realise have been just a keystroke away.  Plus
some features do not have default keys but you can assign one; I think
cycling through available targets may be one such feature.

The Options/Keys window is mentioned in a few places in the FAQ, but I'm
thinking I should add a question along the lines of, "What key opens
the <whatever> window?  What's the key for doing <whatever>?" that just
refers folks to that option tab.
