    You'll see it again when you read my response to Meem, but I'll say it
again. No guilds set this up. No great meeting of war chieftains set this in
place on my server. The clerics that were sitting there on the ledge,
watching a bare patch of ground and hoping it would end soon without
conflict, started talking to one another and realized that they all felt the
same way. The clerics came to this agreement. The clerics that are out there
are the ones who keep track of who is next. If you want to get a piece of
Ragefire, young cleric, scurry off to Skyfire and put in the time helping
others. Not many clerics can afford to spend that much time (it works out
much longer than the old Ragefire camp) doing nothing but staring at the
ground, or maybe doing XP pulls with guildmates. They are the ones this
system weeds out.

    We don't have 30 clerics out in Skyfire. There aren't enough clerics on
the server that can put in the time and effort that the camp now requires,
or who are willing to do so. I am one of those that cannot afford the time
at this time. I feel no sense of animosity over this. When I feel my guild
can do without me on raids for a while, I'll go to Skyfire and start helping
others and earn my epic.

    That cleric should go to Skyfire, and start helping watch the camp. His
guild should support him, watching for him when he's offline. His guild
should help kill Ragefire when it pops, and will hopefully win some randoms
on the loots. And when his turn comes, his guild should congratulate him on
earning his epic and let him sleep. =)

    The same way the above cleric did. If you can get friends to cover for
you when you have to be offline, you can get a spot. Not all clerics can get
people to help them like that, or are willing to sit somewhere and not
advance themselves. And some clerics are patient, and can, and do.
