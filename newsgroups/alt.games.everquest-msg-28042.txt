    Working on it...the gaining levels part.  But I'm not exactly
a power lever or anything.  I will be making my own arrows for a 
long, long time.

    Yes.  Benlen.  All my characters, and my husband's, will have this 
name.  Its a contraction of my maiden name, Benson, and his, Lennaman.
I know, from a roleplay stance it sucks. But it is at least not that
likely to be repeated by many others.
    I did once start a druid named Lipton, before I found my groove.
I really liked that name, but I was nervous that any passing GM would
force me to change it to Illayenaiea or something obviously
"manufactured".
Nothing against the computer generated names, I just don't want to have
one.

   It's awesome.  But now I'm level four, and soon it will be
time to leave...

           up staggering into it some day.
