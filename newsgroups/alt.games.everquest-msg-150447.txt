Well, I tried it.  Testing it was harder than I expected, because most of
the camps of social things I remembered are low enough level that they come
single normally.

However, I happened to go to Cobalt Scar, and Yvolcarn was spawned in one of
his more obnoxious locations--at that monument thingy next to the port
circle.  All three of the Wyverns around the circle are close enough that if
you pull any of them, Yvolcarn comes to.

So, I targeted one of the Wyverns, fired the bolt, and hit the potion.
Yvolcarn still came.
