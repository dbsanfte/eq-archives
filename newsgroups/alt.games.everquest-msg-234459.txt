Yeah, pets have long been the scapegoats for other people's
bone-headed actions, but many of these excuses, fortunately, have been
killed now. Pet getting blamed for breaking mez? Now there's a message
saying WHO broke mez. Big surprise when people found out that 95% of
mez breaks were caused by PLAYERS. Pets getting blamed for pulling
trains? Suddenly pets are made non-aggro when just passing through and
not attacking anything. Suddenly people are looking at the guy that
came along just behind the pet that the train followed.

True, pet pathing and other oddness does cause problems, but exactly
which problems are their fault is becoming less questionable and
suddenly they're not the worst problem-causers in the groups anymore.
