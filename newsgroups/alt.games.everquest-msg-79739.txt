Don't think so. My agnostic DE enchanter (who has never done any faction work
in Neriak) checks with all the merchants there quite regularly looking for
words (including those in the necro/sk and warrior guilds) and she has *never*
been attacked by anyone, anywhere in Neriak. She can't get quests from the
necro/sk guilds, and there are one or two vendors who require a little, um,
attitude adjustment to get them to display there wares; but other than that,
they tolerate her pretty well.
