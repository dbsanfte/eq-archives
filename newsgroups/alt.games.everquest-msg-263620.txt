True, the only 'tactics' are those employed by the puller to grab a
single mob.  Other than that, slowers slow, DPSers smack, the tank tanks
and the healer heals the tank.  If the puller isn't able to grab a
single (as when the mobs are positioned so you can't pacify the ones
around the corner without aggroing the one in front of the hall and
pulling them all anyway), everybody needs to know what mob to beat down
first, the tank has to know when to worry about keeping aggro from a
different critter because a healer/mage is getting eaten, etc.

Multiple pulls add a lot more tactical thinking to a situation, but not
having the option to single pull is what bothers me.  If I am out
solo'ing, I would like the option to pull a single rather than having
the whole group come down on me.
