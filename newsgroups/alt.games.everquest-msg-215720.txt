Also of note is that XP has a feature called compatibility mode, sometimes
it works and sometimes it doesn't. If you find you have a program that
doesn't work on XP that worked on Win 98 then just try the following.

Right click on the shortcut for the program you are trying to use.
Click on properties, then click on the compatibility tab at the top.
Click on the "Run this program in compatibility mode" box.
Now you have a selection of various operating systems to try, (even Win 95)
Apply settings and you are good to go.

Note: this is not foolproof as it just emulates the other operating systems.
I have had it work ok on 2 programs but fail on 2 others.

Hope this helps.
