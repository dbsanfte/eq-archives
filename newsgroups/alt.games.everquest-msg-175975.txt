Paladin and SK are generally much better than a Warrior at grabbing
and holding agro.  The reasons the Warrior is the best tank in the
game are:  HP, HP, AC, Disc Defensive (situational and L55+), & HP.
The Warrior's challenge is to learn every agro management trick in
the book, knowledge is power, and to acquire suitable gear (Warrior
is the most gear dependant class in the game, ghetto Warriors have a
tough row to hoe).
