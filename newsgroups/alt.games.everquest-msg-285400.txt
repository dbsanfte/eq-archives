What about Warrens?  I do not know if the zone is too low for your group. 
But the lay-out is challenging as well as the location of the mobs. 
Furthermore, you will be gaining faction for later entrance to The Hole.  I 
understand the difficulty gets greater as you proceed from Paineel side to 
Stonebrunt side.

One of my favorite zones for the level is South Karana, starting at the 
birds in the south and moving to the spires and gnolls later.  In using the 
bird area, there is challenge in extracting the inhabitants of the small 
houses where one or two live and pulling from the large house where there 
are about 10 located at various levels.
