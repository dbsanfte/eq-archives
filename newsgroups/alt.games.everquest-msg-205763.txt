However, the time limit on wolf form is MUCH higher than the time
limit on SoW, at least for the higher level wolf forms.

Other thing is that wolf gives you infravision.  Doesn't matter as
much now (seems like Verant eased up on having nite be pitch black)
but years ago when my human druid finally got wolf I was ecstatic that
I could see at nite.  Up till then about half the time the game was
almost unplayable.  I realize there aren't many human druids out
there, but I was in wolf form almost continuously once I got it.
