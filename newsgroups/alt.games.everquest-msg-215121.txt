With all the flaws in EQ you'd think, there would be *some* interest. I 
know I am interested in EQ2, just as I was interested in AC, AC2, 
Shadowbane, DaoC, Anarchy Online, the upcoming Worlds of Warcraft etc... 
the only mmrpg that I wasn't really interested in was Star Wars, and 
that's just due to the utter shite that SW has become.

So they might not get it right. With all the flaws in EQ its worth 
taking a look... they might at least make an incremental improvement. It 
might be more fun per hour overall... that at least bears looking into. 
They might royally screw it up to but one should at least be open minded 
about it.

So you'd 'lose years worth of stuff', big deal... that's like letting a 
game of monopoly go on for ever because you don't want to lose your 
accumulated monopoly money. What's the point ...that 'stuff' is utterly 
worthless outside the game. Keep your friends, remember your 
experiences, and take a screenshot or two, but don't ever be afraid to 
walk away from the 'stuff'.

Its true of life, its trebly true of a video game.
