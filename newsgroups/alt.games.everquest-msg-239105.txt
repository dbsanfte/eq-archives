So when _is_ the time then?  Was I supposed to discuss it with them before 
they invited me?  Basically, in my playtime, I get maybe one invite an 
hour or so.  So I have three choices.  The first two, ignore the "want an 
LDoN?" tell from Everfrost and wait for a Tak one, go to Tak and start 
forming a group, mean waiting a much longer time to actually play.  The 
third option, ask if the group I'm headed for/just joined would consider 
another venue, takes 2-3 minutes, sure, but usually it turns out 3/5 of 
the other players don't care where, one would prefer to stay but doesn't 
care that much, and one would rather go where I suggested.  So yeah, if I 
join, I wouldn't mind 30 seconds or a minute to say 'howdy' and discuss 
things on that account.  

}Also, you don't suppose they invited you without knowing their weaknesses 
}do you?

One would think that is a safe assumption.  But that wouldn't explain some 
of the lousy-ass groups I've ended up in, that could have been sooo much 
better if they'd, say, brought a healer other than a ranger...

Generally, if I join a group and everyone rushes off to a dungeon the 
instant I get there, it's invariably been a total disaster.  If I join and 
we talk for a couple minutes first, at least I see the disaster coming. :)

}> }Hell, most of my most recent LDoN's have been over in just over 30

}> }Third - WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT STANDINGS?  The only thing I worry

}If guaranteeing a win means not playing, then yes.

I never said 'guaranteeing', nor would I.  Shit happens, there are no 
guarantees.  If waiting a few minutes means significantly greater odds of 
winning, though, I'd recommend waiting.  And I'd look heavily askance at 
the people insisting that we must GO! GO! GO! NOW! BEFORE MY BRAIN 
EXPLODES FROM NOT GETTING TO TURN AUTOATTACK ON FOR 5 WHOLE MINUTES!! 

Such people invariably end up wasting 90 minutes of -my- time dragging me 
on an adventure that doesn't succeed.  So cool, I got a dribble of exp and 
a split of pathetic loot.  My standings got worse and I didn't get the 
adventure points that I was really after.  Thanks.  Next time, I'll be 
really eager to group with you.

}> Of course, all the people who are high in the standings that I've seen
}> were only doing LDoN in guild groups or groups where they knew

}> are gonna suck as bad as mine. :)
}Mine don't, my BL has no losses.  All my mage's losses date back to
}the early days of LDoN.  This is PU groups and Groups of regulars.

Almost all my wins are with 'groups of regulars' (read: guildies).  All my 
losses are with pickup groups.  All the pickup groups I lost in had some 
jerk in them that insisted we must pull now and never stop to med or 
breathe or talk and get to know each other.  That's usually the same jerk 
that overpulls and wipes us 3 times in a group that was in too much of a 
rush to bother getting a cleric.

}Some people are too cautious - because a loss would look bad.  "Oh
}dear, I won't just dive in and see how we do, because if we decide
}to bail it'll show up on my record."  Dive in, see if you can do it,
}should be clear within a few minutes if your group can hack it.

Sure.  It's usually clear to me within a few minutes we aren't going to 
succeed.  Of course, it's usually clear on the basis of the fact we 
were all rushed off to the dungeon without the three people who are 
anon even bothering to say what class they are, alone.  And then, on 
average, we have me and one other person who wouldn't mind terrbly if we 
canned it and I went back to tradeskilling, 1 person who insists we keep 
trying, and three people who think that grinding exp extremely slowly and 
incompetently makes it worth staying.  Not to mention the LOOT!  Oh!  The 
glorious, phat lewt!! 

Fuck LDoN, quite frankly.

}We do 65 normals with 5 people, a BL tank, root CC and a pulling 
}technique best described as "Pull 'em all and let Inny sort 'em 
}out."

Let me guess, this would be your 'group of regulars', right?  I really 
wouldn't mind having a group of regulars.  I really must change my work 
schedule around so I'm playing at the same time as guildies again.
 
}Last week I had one good sized block of playing time (5 hours,
}Thursday morning).  And due to the kind of prissy "Oh dear, we
}might get a boo boo" attitude that this guy showed, I lost over
}1/3rd of that sitting on my ass.  I have no patience for that
}anymore.  My response to that these days is "ok, gluck on that you
}guys" and /disb /LFG.  Funny thing since I switched to a BL - I get 
}tells for groups within a few minutes of going /LFG.  This morning I 
}got one within 1 minute, then another before I could turn it off.

Somehow, they just don't come that fast for enchanters at 2 in the 
morning.  /disb /LFG just means sitting there for another hour anyway...
I'd much rather take the group I've got.  But if I can arrange it, I'd 
like to spend 3 minutes discussing tactics and stuff, and making sure 
we're all on the same page.  Would that be all right with you, oh lord?

Oh no, I see you've disbanded in a huff.  Hopefully the next person I 
invite will have a bit mroe patience.
