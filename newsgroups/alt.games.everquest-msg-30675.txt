You have 2 realistic choices (Linux isn't a realistic choice if you had to
ask the question):

Add another network card to your best PC and share that connection with any
other computer on the network (using a hub).  With Win98SE (must be SE),
WinMe and Win2k that's fairly easy.  You do it using ICS (internet
connection sharing).

But still, unless you're a computer geek it's more trouble than it's worth,
especially since if the "host" PC (the one with 2 cards) needs to rebooted,
the "client" PC loses its connection.

BY FAR the sanest and easiest solution is to buy a 4-port broadband router.
Linksys and Netgear have the most popular.  If you happen to have a hub
laying around you can save a few bucks by buying a 2-port.  I have the
Linksys and the setup booklet was only a few pages.  It's been a while since
I bought it but I don't think I had to do ANYTHING besides plug the cables
in the right holes. :)
