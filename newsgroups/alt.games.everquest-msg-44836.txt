No, can't see the logic.
...In fact...*plugs a few numbers into Copeland's Weapon Analyzer*...the Canes
will outdamage the batons until level 50, when they do the same damage.

There is some controversy over this. The accepted method is, faster weapon in
primary and slower in offhand.  However, before level 35 or so (when the damage
bonus really starts kicking in), you usually want to put the weapon with the
better ratio in primary.

Get copeland's weapon analyzer.
