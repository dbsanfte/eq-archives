Blackburrow gnoll teeth was far from an exploitable quest. For one
thing, the teeth are no drop, so unlike orc belts there's no farming
with your high level character and feeding backpacks to your newbie. As
well, the drop rate on the teeth is relatively rare. As an example, I
decided I wanted to get my iksar monk non-KoS in Quenos so he could do
the headband quest. I literally killed every gnoll in blackburrow for 4
hours and maybe got 80 teeth out of it. That was with a L45 monk, and
for a lot of the time there wasnt more than 1 or 2 gnolls alive in
Blackburrow. Any appropriate level character fighting there wasn't going
to get enough teeth for more than a pleasant bump to thier experience
bar occasionally before they leveled high enough that the experience
both from killing gnolls and farming teeth was meaningless.
Additionally, any character would be a lot further ahead by going to
Paludal Caverns as soon as they hit the right level, which is still in
range for hunting in Blackburrow, where they'd get far faster leveling
because of the mad zone modifier in PC.

As to the idea of changing the ZEM for North Quenos, while I wouldn't
put it past SOE to just blanket change all the city zones to fix a
problem with one or two, I can't recall ever seeing anyone hunt guards
in North Quenos in the entire time I've been playing EQ.
