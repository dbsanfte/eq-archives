There are positives to US-centric release policies as well.  Here in
Australia SWG still hasn't been released in the shops, but in the meantime I
have since discovered by consistent feedback from other MMOG players that it
is not worth playing anyway. That proberly saved me 90bucks for the game and
a few months subscription fees.

I would say "Every cloud has a silver lining" but it doesn't suit my
demeanour very well. How about: "All the shit in the world makes methane a
viable alternative fuel source"..
