www.eqprices.com.

Even if you don't consider it accurate for "price checks"
(although the prices are fairly reliable if you know how
to eyeball the price-over-time graphs), it's the best
searchable EQ item database I've found.  Great for making
"shopping (or questing) lists", comparing items, etc.

Fantastic for posting your character's status so that
other people can view it.  For example, check out:

Left-click an item to inspect it.
