not many people go into Grobb, found the Realm of Heroes NPC in there and
here is his tale for your amusement

[Wed May 30 00:51:06 2001] You say, 'Hail Rasrok the Blotched'
[Wed May 30 00:51:06 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Hail, yerself. What you
want? Youse shud know dat youse talkin to a hee-ro. Me give many peeples
[nightmares] and dat make Cazic-Thule happy soes he tooks me to da [Realm of
Heroes]. I live dere a long time but now me back here agin. My job iz ta
reward dose dat urned favor in da eyes of da gods.
[Wed May 30 00:51:25 2001] You say, 'what nightmares'
[Wed May 30 00:51:25 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Dis a long story but I
like tellin it cuz it about me. Trolls is gud cooks but youse need da right
ingredients to make da really gud stuff. Meez always liked da taste of dem
[high elves] da best so meez went to where day live over on Faydwer.
Sometimes day hard to catch and day get away. Den day bring back dair
friends and try to git you and dats bad.
[Wed May 30 00:51:50 2001] You say, 'what high elves'
[Wed May 30 00:51:50 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Uh-huh. Day taste da
best all right. Tink it is cuz day eat so many vegetables and stuff. Makes
dem taste kinda like a rabbit. Soes anyway, meez saw one alone one day so
meez run it down and kills it good. But it weren't a high elf. It wuz really
one of dem dark elves dat had a [ring] dat made him look like one of dem
udder elves. I ates him anyway but he wuz kinda stringy.
[Wed May 30 00:52:18 2001] You say, 'what ring'
[Wed May 30 00:52:18 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Yup. Soes meez gots dis
ring and I can use it ta look like one of dem high elves. Meez thought it
wuz a good way to git dem. Soes I walk around in dair villages and stuff for
a while and thought about all dem tasty elves. But meez had a [problem].
Even though I could get close to dem lookin like day do, day wouldn't follow
me away from dair towns soes I could eat dem.
[Wed May 30 00:52:43 2001] You say, 'what problem'
[Wed May 30 00:52:43 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Da problem is dat dose
elves talk in a funny accent. Day would look at me funny when I talks to
dem. Soes this is what meez do. I looked fer one of da smart ones ta leave
from his shop one night and I caught him but didn't eat him. I took him back
to da [cave] I was stayin in. I kept da ring on still but meez told him I
wanted him to learn meez to talk like da udder elves. After learnin me dat,
meez said meez would let him go.
[Wed May 30 00:53:14 2001] You say, 'what cave'
[Wed May 30 00:53:14 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Soes he learn me ta
talk like da elves do. Took a few months but I learned it. I figgered it was
worth all da effort since meez would have all da high elf meat meez could
want after dat. After meez tink he did a good job at teachin me to talk like
da udder elves, meez ate him. Want meez ta [show you how] dose elves talk
over dere?
[Wed May 30 00:53:43 2001] You say, 'show me how'
[Wed May 30 00:53:44 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Day go like dis. . .
''How are you gentlemen!!! It is a fine day today you must agree. Would you
care to have a look at my wares? Perhaps you would be interested in
purchasing one of my savory meat pies.'' Day are stoopid like dat. Meez
could say enough tings like dem dat day weren't no longer scared. Soes what
I did next wuz what [started] meez on da [path] dat urned me da favor of
Cazic-Thule.
[Wed May 30 00:54:15 2001] You say, 'started what path'
[Wed May 30 00:54:15 2001] Rasrok the Blotched laughs maniacally and says,
'After meez ate dat elf what learned me to talk funny like dem, meez went to
his house and took da stuff he didn't need. Meez yoozed da money ta buy a
small [shop near Kelethin]. Meez sold stuff in da day and at night meez went
after da high elves. Day were easy ta catch at night cuz dair is less people
around and day was drunk lots of times.'
[Wed May 30 00:54:50 2001] You say, 'what shop near kelethin'
[Wed May 30 00:54:51 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Meez made a lot of
money in dat little shop sellin da meat pies I made outta all da elves.
Udders like da humies and dorfs started ta come to meez shop ta buy da meat
pies too. Everybody loved da meat pies and thought day was good. So many
peeples wer commin ta meez shop dat I had ta [step up production]. Troll
cookin is da best cookin, course day thought meez was a high elf.
[Wed May 30 00:55:18 2001] You say, 'how did you step up production'
[Wed May 30 00:55:18 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Yeah. Meez needed lots
more meat soes I could fills all da orders. Pretty soon though, peeples
started ta notice all da missing elves and started gettin worried. Da
streets of Felwithe started lookin kinda empty actually. Da stoopid elves
thought it was vampires from Castle Mistmoore dat was takin peeple. Anyways,
meez had ta lower da standards and started mixin in some wood elf and even
humie and dorf once in a while. But it still wasn't [enough].
[Wed May 30 00:55:42 2001] You say, 'what was enough'
[Wed May 30 00:55:42 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Usually meez go out and
get da fresh meat I needed fer da pies but I came up with a better idea.
Meez stay open late and let da meat come to me! Dat way meez need to hunt
less and could spend more time at da shop cookin up da pies. Dat worked good
for a while. Something [bad] happened one night though.
[Wed May 30 00:56:03 2001] You say, 'what was bad'
[Wed May 30 00:56:04 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'It was late in da night
and dis dorf came stumblin into da shop. He was real drunk and I thoughts he
might add a tangy zip to da pies with all da liquor in em. Soes when he
turns around I swung meez cleaver to take his ugly head off but it broke
when it hit sumthin hard around dis dorf's neck. Come to find out da dorf
has dis big [iron collar] around his neck. Of course, he starts screaming
like a dorf.
[Wed May 30 00:56:27 2001] You say, 'what iron collar'
[Wed May 30 00:56:28 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Yeah. Some stoopid
peeple dat thought it was vampires started wearin dese big iron collars
around dair necks at night to keep from bein bit. So I gots dis dorf
bellowing all loud soes I put my hand over his head and tries to smother
him. Dem dorfs are pretty tough. He bit meez finger clean off. Turn out ta
be da finger dat had da ring on it. So now da dorf knows meez am a troll and
he start yellin even louder. Den meez started hearin [voices coming] toward
da shop.
[Wed May 30 00:57:00 2001] You say, 'what voices coming'
[Wed May 30 00:57:00 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Da dorf attracted a lot
of attention with all his yellin. A pretty big crowd showed up so meez
started runnin. Since day no like da trolls, day was pretty mad. I got away
okay but all dem wizards and druids and magicians day got over dere burnt me
up pretty good. Dats why I have all dese nice blotchy scars. [What happened
next] was da best part. Cazic-Thule was really happy.
[Wed May 30 00:57:27 2001] You say, 'what happened next'
[Wed May 30 00:57:28 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Meez was pretty popular
before day knew dat meez was a troll. Everyone in Faydwer knew about da pies
I made and most of dem peeples dere liked da meat pies a lot. But when day
searched da shop after meez ran away, day found all da heads of da peeples
dat turned up missin. Dats when day finally realized dat da missin peeple
were in da pies day all liked. Dis is da [fun part] dat really got
Cazic-Thule's attention.
[Wed May 30 00:57:51 2001] You say, 'what fun part'
[Wed May 30 00:57:51 2001] Rasrok the Blotched laughs and says, 'When day
all found out dat day had been eatin dair friends all dis time word spread
real fast. Peeples all over was hor-ee-fied. Some didn't sleep for weeks and
many refused to eat for a long time. Dem elves live a long time and dose dat
still remember still have nightmares about it and are still scared to eat.
All dis fear I caused made Cazic-Thule really happy so he took me from dis
plane. And still my [legend] is told quietly by some of dem elves.'
[Wed May 30 00:58:18 2001] You say, 'what legend'
[Wed May 30 00:58:18 2001] Rasrok the Blotched says 'Oh yeah. Day tell dair
little elves if day ain't gud, Rosrak will come bake dem into a pie and eat
dem. Some tink dat dis is only a legend told ta scare peeples. But whether
day knows it's true or not, day still feed Cazic Thule with da fear caused
by dat story. Heh. Meez not know what da big deal is with eatin a good pie
but elves and dose udder peeples are pretty stoopid ta start with.
