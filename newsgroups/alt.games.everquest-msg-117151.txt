It is not an either/or proposition. It is rational
to work things out, as you say. This does not make
it irrational to choose a different way.

Choosing death over life (got it right, this
time), is not always the act of an irrational
mind.

Why would they not find it rational?

Have you ever read 'A Tale of Two Cities', or
Hamlet's soliloquy... both masterpieces of the
rationalisation of suicide.

What of the death of Seneca, or the practice of
seppuku?... all rational decisions.

I do agree with this point, but it wasn't what I
meant to say.

It serves me right for typing faster than my brain
actually works.... that should have read 'death
over life'.

Could you use this same argument to deny
compensation to asbestos workers who contract
mesothelioma , because they had the option of
working elsewhere?

As I understand it, the lawyer is putting forward
the case that EQ should come with a warning about
its addictiveness, similar to the warnings put on
cigarette packs.

That could be her primary motive, but I am not so
sure it is.

Yes, but what part of the government would decide
this.... the executive, judiciary or legislative?

It might be a case of "better the devil you know"
