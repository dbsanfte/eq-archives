Howdy.
I posted earlier about getting disconnected so I went out and bought a
serial external modem to replace my winmodem.
 Now I don't get outright disconnected as I used to. But I'm still gettin
huge lag (up to 95%) if I zone into a new zone and move about.
If however, I stare at the ground or a blank wall, the lag-meter drops back
down to 0%.
A few things I've noticed: If I camp out and relog, the lag is not nearly as
bad. It's almost as if my system only has memory for 1 zone at a time and is
overwhelmed when I zone into a new zone.
Losing xp at post 50 is a huge pain in the ass and like a fool, I went out
and bought Luclin in the hope it would overwrite some obscure file,dll or
setting and return EQ to how it used to be, but no :(.
I have a 733 PIII with 256Mb of ram and a 32 Mb TNT2 Ultra card and loads of
HD space. Windows ME with ICS turned off (I waited 3 weeks for an email
response and got that response) and also my virus checker turned off.
After 8 petitions in-game I got the generic reply saying "get more memory,
get ISDN or cable blah blah" - the condescending bastards seem to think that
I should customise my $3000 PC to play EQ. Is the next step going to be an
EQ only machine? Will we have to buy a specific PC to play EQ? The EQPC.
Sounds expensive.
I digress - ) Is there a setting or file somewhere that somebody has had the
same problem with? Any help would be appreciated, and I'll get a lot of
satisfaction telling the next GM that their help amounted to jack and I had
to come here to get help.

Phil.
(I'm gonna go take my medication now).
