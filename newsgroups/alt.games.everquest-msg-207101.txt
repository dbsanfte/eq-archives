For a really fun trip, try it at level 9 with no invis of any type, and a 
SoW spell that is slower than at least some of the mobs on the way.  Oh, 
and forget to bind on the way.

Back in the old days....

I did that run from Halas to Oasis back when I was level 9, pre 
soulbinders.  I could not bind yet, and had no means of invising, 10pp 
for a potion was out of my reach at that time, so no invis either.  I got 
killed twice, once to a griffene in NK, and once to a Highland Lion (they 
run faster than level 9 sow) also in NK.  But, I did make it and bought 
my Serpent Sight spell.

For a real fun time, run a naked level 1 gnome from Ak'anon to Halas.
