I cant speak to Sullon, Tallon, or Rallos, but as far as Vallon Zek is
concerned it seems to be as "desserted" as Torvon is. Perhaps a few more
people in PoK, but usually same Bazaar numbers, and as far as Zones that Ive
been hunting in, about the same population.

Of course Zone population is a very skewed metric for a PvP server, as
control of Zones is a hotly contested issue by various guilds at times.

However judging from where I currently reside you can guess as to my opinion
on PvP in EQ in general :P

Just my 2p.
