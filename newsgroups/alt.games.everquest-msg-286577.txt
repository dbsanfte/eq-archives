	I'm reasonably sure it's a memory leak in the client, because of
the behavior.  The PC is a well maintained vanilla Intel XP box with 100%
updated patches and drivers, and no special hardware.  It also does nothing
but run EQ.  I do all my real work on Linux :-)

	Sure, it might be local driver bug.  That's why stuff like this
doesn't upset me (on Windows :-).  It's almost not worth the effort to find
and fix.  Glaringly obvious critical bugs in a production software release 
are different kettle of cobalt cod.
