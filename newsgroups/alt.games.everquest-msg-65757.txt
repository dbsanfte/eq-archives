Understood, but keep in mind that this is a pay service an when you are made
unable to play then you sit and bide your time.  While sitting and biding your
time you go to a ng.  Curiosity makes me want to read the posts.  As I read I
see that there are alot of peeps blowing off steam.  Well EXCUUUUUUUUUUUSE US.
For a year we've been waitng adn now that its out we cant play.  Pardon us for
our infantile raving.  I mean  sure 50 bucks for upgrades isnt a whole lot of
money.  But it is the xmas season and money could be better spent elsewhere.
Once again I apologise for being mad.  After all I guess it kinda made you mad
that we were. Hmmmmm....
