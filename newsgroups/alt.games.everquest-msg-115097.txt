Yes, we can make them, they are ridiculously expensive to make, and have a
very high trivial level, read above 180, so they are never trivial to make.
The mana regen potions regen 2 or 3 mana per tick, depending on which potion
is made.  The cost to attempt one dose of the cheap potion is something like
72pp with best prices on the components.  You need to be a level 60 shaman
in order to have a 180 skill in alchemy, and even then, the potions are not
trivial.  Personally, I think they just added them as a joke.  There is also
an intellectual advancement potion, raises your effective casting level by
3.  At my current level of 53, I figure that on average it would cost me 1k
to 1.4k pp to make one dose of the cheap breeze potion.  To make the better
potion, it would cost about 300pp more.  At level 60, the cost to make the
potions probably goes down to the 140pp range.  That's for one dose of a
potion that gives you breeze, not clarity.  If I was going to sell the
potions, I would sell them for 180pp or so minimum, and that's when I'm
level 60.  For the really rocking 3 mana/tick potion, it would be probably
200pp minimum.  So, tell me, would you find an enchanter to cast a better
mana regen on you for a much lower cost, or would you buy this potion from a
shaman?  A level 16 enchanter can cast a breeze on you for the same effect
as the cheaper potion, and would probably be happy with a 10pp donation for
it.

Alchemy is not a total waste mind you, SoW potions have funded my tradeskill
habit, but the new Luclin potions were just cruel.
