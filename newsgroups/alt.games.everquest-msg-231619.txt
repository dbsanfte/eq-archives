Hmm... In my head, I'm replacing "Sony" with "Microsoft", and seeing 
where the train of thought takes me. It looks like the market for online 
RPGs isn't anywhere as open as it was thought to be, and there is 
actually a finite amount of money to be made in the genre. If one 
company achieves a critical mass of content and community, and takes all 
the money there is to be made in this business, there will be *less* 
choice, not more.

Don't get me wrong, I love EQ, I've been playing from day one of release, 
and I will probably buy and play EQ2 when it comes out. The only other 
MMORPG I ever had a passing interest on was Middle Earth Online, but 
things like this:

http://www.middle-earthonline.com/index.php?section=news&
article=teamletter010804

are making me harbour serious doubts about how much of a clue these 
people have. All in all, I'm glad that it's been Sony that won the 
market-share, and not Microsoft with AC, for example.
