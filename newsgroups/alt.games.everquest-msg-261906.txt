Repops don't crash the zone. As a matter of fact, unless you're a pet
class, tracker looking frequently at track, looking straight at mobs,
or are very tuned to the "feel" of the EQ client (there is a slight
freeze on par with a fifth of a second or so), you won't even notice a
repop happening. Was a part of enough repops on Test to get to know
them quite well.
