I think you are. All I'm reading what he said as if people never played the
original EQ they might post here now because they started playing EQ2.
Granted, I think he's wrong - I think most people who didn't play EQ and
are now playing EQ2 most likely stick with the web based boards. Nothing
scientific to back it up but it's just a feeling I have.
