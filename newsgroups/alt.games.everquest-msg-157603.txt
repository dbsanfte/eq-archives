I was running around up there last night with my lvl 11 shammy...  he is
SOOO in love with the fact that he doesn't need to bother a druid for a port
anymore!  (at least not in the near future!)  First thing he did when he got
there was visit the soulbinder!

The only place he couldn't go was the Plane of Tranquility... EQ program
said he was too low level...

I haven't been up there with my main, a lvl 27 warrior, but do not
anticipate any probs using the TP.
