Do you mean like how the Palestinians have kept true the relevant UN
articles?  Let's look at Resolution 194 from 1948.  This one
proclaimed that Jerusalem should be placed under international control
and all shrines should be kept open to all.  

That didn't happen.  The government of Transjordan promptly annexed
the West Bank of the Jordan and declared itself the Kingdom of Jordan.
The annexation was illegal under the resolution.  For the next 29
years, Jews could not enter East Jerusalem to pray at the most holy
site in our religion - the Western Wall.  On top of which, of course,
Muslims built two Mosques.  Under the resolution, Jerusalem consists
of "...the present municipality of Jerusalem plus the surrounding
villages and towns, the most eastern of which shall be Abu Dis; the
most southern, Bethlehem; the most western, Ein Kerem (including also
the built-up area of Motsa); and the most northern Shu�fat".  This was
taken verbatim from the Balfour plan that established the original
partition for the Jewish and Palestinian homelands.

Article 194 also requires that any one demanding the right of return
to lands previously occupied by Arabs that are now part of Israel must
foreswear the use of arms against Israel.   The palestinians as well
as their Arab sponsors have refused to accept this part of the
resolution.  

In general, the PLO and the Arabs will scream about resolutions 242
and 338.  However, the part they leave out is that all aspects of
final status discussions must be resolved through negotiation.  The UN
has not and cannot mandate a peace settlement.   Resolution 242 also
does not demand that Israel retreat to the pre-1967 borders as they
were clearly unrealistic and undefendable.  The French have been
rather miffed about this as they insist their version says the
Israelis do have to withdraw.  However, as the Americans and the
British initially proposed the language, under the rules of the UN the
language of parties submitted the resolution is the legal vesion.

Further, Resolution 242 states "Termination of all claims or states of
belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the
area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized
boundaries free from threats or acts of force."  It also recognizes
the rights of the parties to create demilitarized zones.  At present,
Israel is constructing exactly such a DMZ - the fence that follows the
1967 borders exactly.

Now, pay close attention to the preceding language in the resolution:
"...termination of... states of belligerency ... respect for and
acknowledgement of the soverignty, territorial integrity".  This
specifically addresses the perpetual state of armed uprising, and that
it is specifically prohibited under the relevant UN articles.  Until
such time as the PLO fully implements 242 and 194, it really doesn't
have a case to make.
