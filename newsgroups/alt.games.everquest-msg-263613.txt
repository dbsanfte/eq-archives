The only reason crafting was *Ever* relegated to mules is because poorly 
thought out games made crafting with your main suboptimal.

In games like EQ, and AC1 a good Warrior is terrible at most 
tradeskills. In EQ the warriors int/wis simply aren't there until 
endgame (where you could max everything out). In AC1 not only did 
working up your tradeskills divert xp from your combat skills, but the 
tradeskills themselves took up slots you could use for combat skills... 
until you were approaching 250th level plus (again maxxing everything 
out).

That is why EQs distinct adveturer/artisan model on a single character 
is a good thing. Having a tradeskill mule doesn't benefit you. Your main 
character can do tradeskills without sacrificing his ability to 
adventure, or doing a piss-poor job of it because his stats are in the 
wrong place.

Players are co-opted into using mules because they don't have big enough 
banks, and can't optimally develop skills on their main character. 
Nobody wants mules for their own sake. Alts sure... but mules? Never.
