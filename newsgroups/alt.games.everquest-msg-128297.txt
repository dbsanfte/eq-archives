He did spell "Lenny" right.  And why should he able to "ogre" right?  He spells (more
or less) phonetically.  Og-er is how the word is pronounced.  He spelled it the
sensible way.  Note... I don't often defend his spelling skills.  His first name is
really "Steven".  "Lenny" comes from "Lennaman", our last name, which is a bit tricky
for him.  But "Lenny", he gets right.
