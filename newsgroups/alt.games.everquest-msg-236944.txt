What are their HP's like, and what level (do you know?).  We don't
find the Sewer mobs that tough in ones, and can handle twos pretty
easily if I get to them inside of about 5-10 seconds.

What we've taken to doing is - the cleric targets to pacify and I
assist him, then I assist the warrior who is on the primary target.
If pacify is resisted and we get both I can slow, ctrl+t, then
spam my slow spell until it casts, then pop my disc.  The mobs go
down so fast that the cleric and druid only have to keep me alive
for about 20-30 seconds.

Also, how far apart are they spaced?  I might just have a go at
300-500 hitters duoing if I can single them.
