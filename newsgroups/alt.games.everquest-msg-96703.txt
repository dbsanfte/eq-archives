I am very impressed to see the amount of changes Verant has been putting
into the game.  If you haven't heard, head over to
http://eq.castersrealm.com (though most of you have).

The changes will piss some people off, but these changes will make it easier
for the 'casual' EQ players (I have been playing for over a year and my
charater is only 27, due to time contraints).

Also, the newb life won't be so bad. It's also nice to see that Verant is
putting time into reevaluating some of our complaints.

And I cant wait to see how they fixed the zoning.

Anyways, flames/comments welcome. /applaud Verant.
