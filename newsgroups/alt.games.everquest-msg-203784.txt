At that level Fear is a killer in terms of mana cost.
Untill about level 10 you are probably better off not using it and just 
attacking the mobs yourself.
Use lifetaps to keep your HPs up and the Mob down. Always have a pet and 
only Clinging darkness as the mob runs (it has a very short duration at 
that level)
