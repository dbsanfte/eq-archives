Doesn't start anywhere. Make (or have someone make for you):
a bottle of demi-sec champagne, a mistletoe cutting sickle, a golden
idol of Tunare, a star ruby gem encrusted stein, a blessed fishing
rod, a ceremonial solstice robe, some sort of halfling pie (don't know
name yet), a Misty Thicket picnic, and a lucky cabbage.
Then, burn it all to ashes in a forge as a holy sacrifice.
