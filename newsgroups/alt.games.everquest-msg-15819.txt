You are correct.  The bar will agro the tower.  What class was your puller?
The key is (often times), to send a puller that can tank a bit too.  That
is, he should *not* run down, tag a mob, and run back up.  He should tag a
mob, wait for it to melee him, then drag it along, ensuring it stays on him
and not running amok aggroing other mobs.

If Unrest is empty (and nowadays it is, sadly), constant pulling of nearby
spawns is required to minimize trains when pulling to your group.

Hope this helps...Unrest is one of my favorite zones <G>.
