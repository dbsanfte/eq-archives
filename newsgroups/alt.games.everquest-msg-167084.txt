You fight naggy at the door. I've seen it done other ways by really
*good* groups of well equipped alts of higher level players, but
generally, to avoid fishing for corpses in the lava for hours
afterwards, you pull Naggy to the door and fight him right there. Nobody
goes in past him except the rogues. If you do it right, his head will be
sticking out into the tunnel when he dies. :-)
