My first impressions on using this was: Nice eyecandy, negligible
benefit.

Something like 6 secs duration, 3 min recast (could be 9s / 2m, don't
quite remember)

Porbably gonna HAVE to use a /shield rotation on Sol Ro or other PoP
mobs, then ignore it's existance outside. Seems zero role for 'reflex'
use of the ability. Warriors have the mob targetted. By the time someone
needs /shield, you might be able to mitigate a proportion of their
damage for 2-3 melee rounds max, but they'll continue to take a large
proportion of it.

Oh, and you can't use it if either you, or your target, are using any
other discipline (such as defensive) though it's on a seperate timer
from regular discs.

Way to improve it? Remove the need to targetting to make it a hotkeyable
reflex move. To do this make it effect everyone in the group. Also, make
it last a little longer (say 15-20 seconds) so you actually take a
decent part of damage. Could up recycle to 5 mins to compensate.

As I said, these are only first impressions, and more tinkering around
is needed before dismissing it totally. Just can't quite see what
situations they had in mind for using this.
