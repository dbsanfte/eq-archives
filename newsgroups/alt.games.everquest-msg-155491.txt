    I've told the newsgroup my "posing for fine steel" story. Delores only
ever got hit on a few more times that I can remember - the bearded woman
thing stops most folks. Rosy, the bearded dwarf rogue, has a gnome wizard
admirer. Mandy, the unbearded dwarf warrior, has been told by other dwarves
that they didn't know dwarves also came in "short and cute". Chastity, the
high elf enchanter, was PL'ed and showered with gifts when she was beginning
to level outside Felwithe. Much to the utter disbelief of my friend, the RL
lesbian playing the male high elf paladin. And my gnome mage, Sprickett,
gets waaaaaay more buffs than the male Iksar monk.

    But by the same token, I do heal and buff every female dwarf I come
across, no matter what character I'm on. I'm sure some of them see it as a
guy thing, when in fact it's a "Dwarf Grrrrl Solidarity!" thing. ;-) I don't
talk to them, though - I'm sure they get enough of that!
