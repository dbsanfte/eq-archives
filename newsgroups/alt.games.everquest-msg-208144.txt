Sacrificing 1 HP for 1 wis nets you MORE than 1 mana. Here:

http://eq.crgaming.com/misc/manacalc/manacalc_wis.asp

Basing on level 51 with 200 wis, I got 1020 mana. On level 51 with 201
wis, it's 1026.

Going higher, 250 wis gives 1310 while 249 wis gives only  1304.

So, that's more like 6 mana per wis. 6 mana for 1 hp is a decent
trade, IMO. Again, it's situational. I beleive that to ignore wisdom
completely in favor of HP wouldn't just be stupid, it would be
suicidal. However, I also don't beleive HP and AC should be ignored
completely in favor of wis, either. Just don't let any lag too far
behind...
