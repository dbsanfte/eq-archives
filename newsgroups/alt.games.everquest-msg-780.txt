Dungeons are a good way to go, Healers are welcome
in pretty much any dungeon.  As a Cleric Unrest is
a good option, but you need a good group with an
excellent puller as the pathing sucks big time,
and training most of the house can happen.  I
prefered Mistmoore to Unrest, but it does not have
the undead that you specialize in.  Mistmoore was
good loot.  I also spent a large portion of 21-28
in Everfrost hunting mammoths.  And if you need
Plat for buying armor/weapon upgrades, the
mammoths drop tusks on most kills which sell for
8-9 pp depending on faction/charisma.  In a group
of usually four people we were all making 75-100
pp for a 3-4 hour session of play.
