This game just keeps showing off new ideas and new ways for
us to have FUN!

My wife and I just started our first Halfling characters in EQ to
try something different and because we'd never been to Rivervale before,
except to run thru the zone on the way to someplace else.

We now have brand new (but short) 4th level Halfling Ranger & Paladin
team to try duo'ï¿½ng with. Lots of melee power with some healing and
buffs for between fights.
...course it works better once my Cleric wanders by to buff her up.  :-)
