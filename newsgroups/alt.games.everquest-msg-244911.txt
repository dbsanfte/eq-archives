My point exactly. He's talking about Object Oriented Programming. What I 
wrote about objects would make sense if you knew sweet FA about OOP. He's 
talking about programming in general. What I wrote about data would make 
sense if you knew sweet FA about programming in general.

differently.

The really short version: You're talking out your ass.
