I know a couple of players that will have problems with LDoN because
of the time limits. Not because they can't play 2 hours a day but
because they have things come up suddenly where they might need a 10
or 15 minute afk, usually due to kids. Not something that's usually a
problem if you're grouped with friends but it can put a damper on LDoN
hunts. 

I had one trip this weekend where I logged on for a little while but
knew I might have to leave before 2 hours were up. If there had been
an adventure with an easy setting, we probably would have tried that
and they would have had the option to complete it w/o me if I had to
leave. As it was, we went to HoH instead.

Uh huh. That's the main reason I changed my mind about the timed
dungeons. Forcing you to do more difficult pulls because of the time
pressure is a 'good thing' in my opinion.
