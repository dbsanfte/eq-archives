They used to work but since all that stuff is pretty much nerfed now
they are now scams.

Actually there is a good way for you to make honest money, pelt
collection to make leather padding.

You don't need much to do this, you need a skinning knife, sewing kit,
and info such as at www.eqtraders.com. Essentially you kill critters
and save any high, medium or low quality skins. The high or medium you
skin down into low quality (unless you get a bear high then you sell
to a player for I'd say at least 30 plat) You also kill spiderlings
(great at level 3 I'd guess) and tailor 2 of their silks into the
thread they make. The thread is then combined with a low qual skin to
make a leather padding. You may want to add some points to tailoring
and max skill on the silk thread before making the paddings but really
you can take some losses and skill up on the paddings quickly without
failing much.

People pay 100 plat or more per stack of leather padding making this
about the best way to get good money at low level. I experimented with
this with an ogre sk untwinked on a server I'd never been on and had
45 paddings to sell by level 6 (mostly having been slowed down by no
real skin outlet prior to being able to run to freeport an get bound)

Once you get some money doing this you can buy many of your skins by
vendor delving, that is a process where you buy say all of the player
sold junk you see that is cheap like snake teeth or scales off of a
vendor and destroy it. Once you empty those vendor slots, new items
you could previously not see which players sold the vendor pop up in
the now empty slots. I've always managed to find many hides and bone
chips by doing this. Of course lately the server goes down so much
making it pretty unlikely you'd find many.

The best time to do this is really when around your level since you
will still be getting xp from the stuff that drops the things.
