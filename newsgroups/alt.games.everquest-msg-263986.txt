That sounds right to me as the intended result. I will test this next time I 
have the pleasure of a party wipe :)  and track it vs my own solo death 
(easy enough to arrange) and see how the numbers come out. I'm suspicious 
because my recollection is pretty clear that I wound up with more debt when 
we party wiped than I would ever get for one solo death, by a wide margin. I 
wish I could be more exact, and there are complicating factors with my 
recollection, but here are the data points that I recall offhand:

1) When you die, your debt is indicated by a red tint in your experience 
bar. Unlike CoH, I don't think there's any place that explicity tells you 
how much debt you have, but you can sort of measure it in EQ2 because the 
experience bar provides a convenient visual scale. The EQ2 exp bar is like 
the EQ bar except that it's divided into ten yellow bars, so it's relatively 
easy to visually see that you're 10%, 20%, 30% etc. (tooltips also tell you 
exactly what the % is).

2) When I die solo and recover my shard, I can see that I wind up with less 
than a yellow bar worth of debt. That is, less than 10%.

3) Two nights ago I was in a party that wiped twice in Vermin's Snye. I had 
no debt going into the encounter, no one else died other than in those two 
wipes, and everyone recovered all their shards. In the end, I wound up with 
more than two full bars of debt.

Probably still bugged. I'll monitor.
