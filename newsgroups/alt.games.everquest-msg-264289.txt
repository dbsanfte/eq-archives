What's wrong with joining on principle? In this case it doesn't sound at 
all to me like the knowledge would have made any difference. They weren't 
about to blacklist someone without good reason, which could not be provided 
in either case. *That's* the principle they were acting on, and were right 
to do so.

I'm not a big fan of the idea of a hundred shades of gray for every black 
and white issue. I *am* a big fan of principle.
