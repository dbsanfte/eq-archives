Tried it with a high elf mage. He's now lvl 5, but made the last level in
under half an hour and the first in about 5 minutes (forgot guild tunic and
had to stop 3 times to regain health / mana.)

Leveling the first few levels is wild. Getting even 1 combat skill up to a
decent number by lvl 10 will be one hard road. Offense and defense will be
lacking and especially for casters the roughly 10 to 20 points defense
you'll miss because of the fast leveling will start to hurt then.

Newbies will level faster, but at lvl 11 they will encounter a huge "hell
level" because no skills are worked up and suddenly exp losses and corpse
runs come into the game.

Just my observation :)
