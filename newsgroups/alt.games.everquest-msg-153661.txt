Ok, that makes sense.  But I've still got to wonder whether they'll
have as hard a time taking out at least some of these mobs as the
first folks to do so did, given that they're likely to have a lot
more knowledge about the encounters and it seems likely that their
gear will be better than the pioneer's was the first time around.

If I'm understanding what's being said by those of you who are
fighting these encounters now, I think the changes are a very good
thing, in principle at least.  It sounds like a lot of the high-end
battles are exercises in tedium, once you've got a 7khp MA, enough
Clerics to keep him alive, and a Mage or two to poop out mod rods,
you just add in a horde of damage dealers and wait for the mob to
drop.  I'm sure there's more to it than that, but it sure sounds
like that's the core tactic for fighting most big mobs, with most
of the variation having to do with mitigating extraneous factors
that might interfere with the basic approach (somebody please
correct me if I'm wrong here).
