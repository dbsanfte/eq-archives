Oh ya, the boards were full of gloating AO-philes proclaiming
EQ players were leaving in droves to play God's gift to gaming.

Anyone who said even the most innocuous of negative things
about AO were labeled as EQ employees infiltrating the AO boards
to spread lies about the game. It was paranoia at it's best. :-)

Well as many problems as EQ has, it's still superior to AO in one
important category--gameplay. 

AO is simply boring and the rats like me deserted, or are deserting 
the sinking ship. :-)
