I have created a beta web page that has a live (well, 5 minutes
delayed) monitor of all the auctions in the EC tunnel and on the
global chat channel "Auction".  You can also search all auctions and
all auctions in the last 24 hours, which is handy for finding those
rare items.

Anyway, check it out.  If you like it, drop me an email.
