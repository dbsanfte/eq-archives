You would not be the first one out there that said they used SoE at a low
level.  And who said anything about your wife?  I had SoW on my Necro,
Warrior and Encanter a lot without casting it.  Just never had SoE until
after 45 as it is not possible to cast on lower levels.

you

the

: bozo, I don't raid!!!  Nor did I make mention of such a wasted use of

can
: get to nexus, grab a KEI and be back to Plains in 5 min. or LESS!  See, I
: use this thing called "Gate" to get to nexus... it directly teleports me
(or
: I have my Wiz there on other box and TL Shaman to nexus) to the bottom of
: the West stairs.  See there are 4 stairways leading up to a platform...
ah,
: never mind, whats the use.  Ah, someday you'll learn a little something
: about EQ and you'll discover something called "extended KEI" which can
last
: up to about 3 1/2 hours and usually 3 hours.  No, after 3 hours in the
: plains I'm ready for a little down time between KEI's so I'll just give a
10
: or 15 min. advanced notice that I'm leaving once the old KEI starts
flashing
: and maybe look for another group a half hour later or go somewhere else
for
: a while UNLESS the group decides it could use a little break too and wants
: to wait while the casters get a new KEI which I'm sure you'll never find
out
: first hand, happens quite often!

No it was your BS I was speaking of.  Oh, you meant that I am BS.  I've been
called worse.  I am in a lot of exp groups and if anyone wants to stop the
fun for "5 minutes toget KEI, they better hope that I am not the group
leader or I may not invite them back in when they return.  I'd actually be
actively recruiting a replace that wasn't addicted.

As to the description, there's one stairway up (to Neth Lair), one down (to
Bazaar) and to that are just ramps (to PoK book and the teleport to Shadow
Haven[there's not stairs there, right?  At work and can't remember]).  And
why go to the Nexus?  Wht not just bind in PoTranq?  There's more 60s there
than you can shake a stick at for your Mind Candy, if you need to pop over
to PoK, it's easy.  Very few hang in Nexus any longer.

So which "Plain" is it that you can just pop over to Nexus, get KEI on
demand, zone 3 plus times back and be in your group again in 5 minutes
(although at one point you said 30 seconds, I'll give the benefit of
literary license)?  Could it be the Plains in Spain?  I hear it rains
frequently there.

: gezzzz.. whats that, some perverted Bard dance or something!  LOL

Nope.  It's Cannibalize (see
http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=1561).  Not Canabalize.  And as a
Shaman, I am surprised you've never done the Canadance.  Just make a hotkey
with /sit off, /cast 1, /pause 30, /sit... Wait for the bump in HP and Mana,
press Cana hotkey, wait again, repeat.  That is called Canadancing.  Are you
really that ignorant of your class?  Let me guess... You did the LoIO, OT,
DL,Karnor's, Velk's route to 56, didn't you?

And, yes,  I also slow/debuff the mobs,  buff the party,  back-up heal (or
DoT depending on situation), and keep Fido pointed at the correct mob (when
he's not off humping the druidess in wolf form), all while Canadancing to
the beat.  Keeps me nearly full mana most of the time, and with HPs always
ready for a smack or 2 should I, by chance, draw aggro (which I am very good
at avoiding).  Guess that makes me a bad Shaman.

costs
: 375 a cast and our slow is 325 mana I believe or something in that
ballpark.
: Considering at least the Melee's (usually 2 in a Plains group dorky) want
: HOS, and if no Druid is in the group the Claric appriciates regrowth if
hes
: 10 IQ points higher than you that is and everyone appriciates slow....
that
: slows the mob so it dosn't hit... ah never mind.  So dig out your Nijina

: cast buffs or I could buff everyone and then sit on my butt for 5 to 8
min.
: med'n mana while the group regrowths 25 mins. tick away.  That makes
sense.

Holy Bejeebus!  No wonder you need KEI.  I never realized that it was that
tough to keep casting HOS on our tanks every 1hr 12mins (without foci).
Boy, that 850 (and it's 425 a pop, not 450) mana takes forever to regen
while standing.  Now I understand.  Do you complain this much about the 600
mana for Regrowth of Dar Khura?  What about the 375 mana a pop for Talisman
of Kragg (more important than the stat buffs, but at least it lasts as
long).  Oh, and I don't sit for 5 to 8 mins,  I...wait for it...Canadance to
get back mana.  With Cannibalize III I get back (let's use the 600 for Dar
Khura as a guideline) All 600 mana in roughly 15 ticks, or, Mr Rocket
Scientist, 90 seconds.  That's assuming I have nothing else going.  With any
other mana regen going (except breeze) I figure roughly one minute.

:
: Before KEI there wasn't a PoP dorky and I can well remember times in KC
: sitting hoping I'd have enough mana for patch heals because the Claric was
: at 1m or worse and our puller got 2 adds on their way back to the group
and
: the Melee's were getting pounded.... usually a result of a monk too, Ah,
: thats it!  you play a monk!  Now I understand!  Cana slot for a nuke...
what
: an idiot!  I'll bet you use the word "why" a lot don't you... no question
: make dorky cause its a retorical question.
:


I was right!  See the KC standing there?  I must bow before your obvious
superiority as a Shaman.
