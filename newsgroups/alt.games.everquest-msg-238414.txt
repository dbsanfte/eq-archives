: i used to play everquest from 1999-2000
: i lost the game in the divorce

That has got to be the strangest settlement I have ever heard of.  Or was it
litigated?  Imagine the back and forth in court! -

Judge - "Are we all in agreement, then?"
Lawyer 1 - "No, our Honor.  There is still the issue of Stormie."
Judge - "Stormy?  Is that a pet?"
Lawyer 1 - "I'm afraid not.  It's a character in Everquest that my
client..."
Lawyer 2 - "Your client had nothing to do with it.  My client loves Stormy
and has clearly spent the most time developing her character and
accumulating loot!"
Judge - "Loot?  What is this?  Something illegal?  Are you sure we want to
tread on this subject?"
Lawyer 2 - "Your Honor, loot is a term for collections gaoined in the game
Everquest."
Lawyer 1 - "What do you mean your client spent the most time.  My client has
logs showing they were on 12 hours a day for 2 weeks straight..."
Client 2 - "Doing Fletching.  Idiot.  Stormy is a gnome enchanter and should
have been working Jewelcraft."
Client 1 - "With what?  You spent all the plat on a a Water Crystal Staff."
Client 2 - "Hey! It was a great deal and saved space for one more spell.
Moron."
Judge - "OK, OK.  Stop this now.  I'll take written argument and go over
this with my 13-year old.  You'll have an answer in a week."

: i never did get much higher than level 30 cleric
: i was all about having fun dabbling with newbies and hunting small stuff
: i did get into some group kills near the end
: i hear it has changed so much -
: that with all the expansions and higher levels being a newbie is not as
fun
: as it was and hunting for bear pelts and baking just doesn't cut it?
: what would you say to someone who was considering buying EQ again?
: would i regret my purchase?
: could i be contented with the low-key playing i am used to?
: i can remember the day i had over 1000 plat in my stash...
: is it all about uber now?
: does anyone still help out the newbies?
:

I was given a Fine Steel 2-h the other day.  New Barb Berserker on Morden
Rasp.  Completely untwinked as I don't have any other chars on the server.

I'm a casual gamer myself, ever since getting married, my time is really
limited.  It all depends on you if you can have fun.  There's plenty of good
people out there.
