You are completely missing the point.
I couldnt care less about this newsgroup that you dont want Cox to carry,
and I am certainly not going to bother asking my ISP to carry any groups
that I have no interest in, no matter how much some of their content may, or
may not insult me.  If someone else feels the need to read something like
alt.deathtoenglish.flame, then who am I to object?  Who am I to say to my
ISP 'I have no interest in that group, so can you please remove it?'.
If I am not interested in a group, then I am not going ask for my ISP to
carry it, and I am not going to ask my ISP to stop carrying one either.
However, I object to people like you asking ISP's to take newsgroups off,
simply because you dont like the content of them.  This is because no doubt
at some point in the future, something that I like will be taken away,
simply because someone else didnt like it and they couldnt bear the thought
of other people enjoying themselves.  The idea of not
reading/listening/watching it is clearly beyond their understanding.
If my ISP doesnt carry a newsgroup because of whatever reason, then fine.
If my ISP DOES carry a newsgroup and it is taken away simply because some
people dont like it, then I object to that.

It IS a big deal, because you are trying to take things away from people
that you have no right doing.  You still havent adequetly answered why you
cannot simply ignore the group, as opposed to having Cox stop carrying it.
