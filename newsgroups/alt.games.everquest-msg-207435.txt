Ditto here. I use a Target bar that's about 4X the standard in width and 
displays % of life left. It's nice on raid mobs where the HP bar barely 
seems to move, or on players when I am binding them.

I shrunk a lot of them, but then set up many text boxes. Two big ones on 
the bottom, one for deafault and the other for /rsay, /g, /gu, and tells. 
Then I have a clear one in my upper left corner about 5 lines long for my 
hits and misses and the mob hitting or missing me, then another one below 
that that is about 1 line and has others hits and misses.

Ditto here. 1-10, and Shift1-10 for different hotkey pages. I don't have 
room for my thrown weapon on my main hotkey page though:

1: Incoming message
2: Flying Kick
3: Robe(the haste one on the way to the epic)
4: Feign Death
5: Deaggro[1]
6: Bind Wounds[2]
7: Assist 
8: Mend (with message to my group so the healer knows when it is down)
9: Mend (so I can see when it pops)
10: /loc

[1]
/pause 2, /attack off
/pause 5, /doability 4(my FD)
/pause 2, /sit off
/attack on

[2]
/g Binding wounds on %t
/ttell Stay still while I bind your wounds
/doability #(the BW one)
(I usually switch to Page 2 after the first bandage, that page has Bind 
Wound on it's own without the spam)

Anyone know a / command to throw a weapon?
