I've played since early 2002 and in my experience it is no more
unstable now than it was then.  The more important problems do get
addressed, others not so much.  For the map background, that has never
bothered me all that much.  All of my windows have a zero-delay on fade
to transparency.  Usually if I can't see the map because the lines are
white, I can just let the map fade to transparency and then look at
something dark in the background.  I would agree that they should have
just made the lines all dark colors, or the background more
easily-altered, but for problems with simple workarounds they often
just let them persist.

I almost never crash, maybe once every few weeks?  When I go LD its my
ISPs fault half the time.

...always crashed on me if I played for more than a few hours.  Also
had lots of bugs.  Shift/CTRL/ALT keys would become "stuck" so that
pushing mouse buttons had oddball results until I figured out what was
happening.  I became stuck in the geometry ALL THE TIME.  Thank god if
you could cast a port spell or had saved recently.  I had a robe that I
would put on to levitate and take off to walk.  Levitate occaisionally
became stuck on me as a permanent effect, which was very annoying
because by the time I noticed it I had not saved for a while.  The
automapping feature would fail and I would travel quite some distance
only to notice that I was surrounded by "darkness" on the map.  There
was some bug that pretty much ruined the game for me at one point.
Something about being named Horator before finishing the Ashkhan
quests.  I was no longer able to become Ashkhan but Vivec wanted
nothing to do with me and the mistake I had made was looooooong since
saved over.  Going back meant pretty much restarting the game.
Finally, I tried to patch the game.  The game became corrupted.  I
tried to uninstall and the uninstall failed.  I tried to reinstall, it
still would not load.  I had to go use "Registry Magic" or some such
program before I could install the game again.

I stil thought it was a pretty cool game too.
