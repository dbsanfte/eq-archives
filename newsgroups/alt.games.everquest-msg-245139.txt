Well, as far as 2HB is concerned, in my case the weapon came first, and 
then the need to skill up to use it. I haven't been losing sleep about 
upgrading my 2HB weapon, but the ratio on that Peacebringer is pretty 
sweet... The weight is rather horrible for a Monk, but this is probably 
a secondary consideration these days.
