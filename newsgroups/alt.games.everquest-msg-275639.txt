Handing down weapons and armor etc. to the next character is not good for
the economy. I used to do it myself sometimes, but I mostly agree with SOE
on this on.

Yes, I could have been without that.

That is not the case in Big Bend on Befallen. I had to buy different kind of
kidlings and coal to find out what to use (why couldn't the recipe tell
