well im sorry -he must have private mailed you cuz it's not on the
board....
so i didnt know it didnt work for him. it worked for me.
and my SO is still in the first couple of days of tryin it.
my thought was, if you have a bottleneck incoming (data rare) but not
outgoing, that would explain the continuing play in game but the dead
signal on client end.....(and if they are undersupporting their servers
as they have been for some time, wouldn't the server get a backlog then
flood the client to catch up?> 
my local tech suggested, and i concur , those cpu's over 1. or so are
not that stable yet and alot of apps and cards have input/output
difficulties with them.
honestly i would be glad to solve my SO's problem. mine is solved but my
cpu is only 650 athlon....whereas his is 1.4 athlon....that is virtually
the only difference in our systems, we both run radeon 7500's.....and
use the same dial up isp <earthlink, yes i know they aren't so great>.
but if diablo II runs excellent on the same connect with no lock up on
the same system then why just EQ?

intrigued...
