Heal your group. After 10 minutes or so of pulls you will start to get
a feel for what kind of mobs you are dealing with and how often you
must heal your members. If you find yourself constantly above 75m,
start throwing out nukes or stuns. Don't bother with melee, unless you
like to get laughed at.
