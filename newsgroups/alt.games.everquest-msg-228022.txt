I feel quite the reverse, that there shouldn't be -any- function that 
only one class can do.

We have 14 classes and can only pick at most 6 in a group.  If there 
were 14 critical functions that could only be filled by one class each, 
then grouping, even with a full group, would be impossible.

If some of the functions were critical but others were not, then you'd 
create at least 8 second class citizen classes (assuming 6 critical 
functions)

Worse, though, would be that if you needed some particular function, 
you'd have to wait for a member of that one class to be available and 
willing to come with you.

Early in the game, we had this basic situation; most people believed 
that doing anything at all -required- a warrior, an enchanter, and a 
cleric.  If you happened to be a member of one of the "holy trinity" 
then that was all well and good... but otherwise, LFG for hours often 
drove people to reroll -as- one of the above, regardless of personal 
preferences.

Then there was the monk, also considered by many a "must have" with his 
superlative ability to split pulls.  This may seem contradictory now, 
but you -still- took the holy trinity, and added a monk, even though 
most people thought of the enchanter solely as a mezzer.  Two slots open 
for the remaining 10 classes!

Gradually people discovered that (sometimes after changes) knights could 
also tank, that bards and necromancers could also mez, that shaman and 
druids could also heal, that split pulling meant you could use single 
pulls instead of pull and mez as a strategy.

Strategic changes, nerfs and improvements to various classes (monk nerf, 
lull boost come to mind) have altered the game a good deal, but 
basically, the idea that for any given job there are around 3 classes 
that can do that job decently (perhaps only one who is -best- at it, so 
in a tight spot you still need them) takes care of a lot of the hassle 
that was inherant in early EQ, where the "sideline classes" had to 
compete against dozens of other people LFG, while whole groups would sit 
around waiting for the next available cleric because they were missing 
that leg of the tripod.

Sadly, there are still classes who sit on the sidelines hoping for a 
slot; warriors, once undisputed kings of tanking, are currently "well, I 
guess if we can't find a knight lets take the warrior and try it", and 
monks seem to have no role at all, weak among the many DPS classes, and 
offerering a slow and inefficient method of splitting mobs.

The only functions I can think of where there's only One class that can 
do it are fairly esoteric; lock picking (bards can do this, but there 
are many places where ONLY a rogue can pick the lock) and PB AE stunning 
(want an AE group?  You Must bring an enchanter, or perhaps two)

I think, all in all, that this is a good thing, for the reasons I 
outlined above; whats needed, IMO is for the two "broken" classes to get 
something that they do -better- than other classes, making them 
desirable, but not that they alone can do, which could make them 
indispensible.  Or if you give them something unique, don't make it 
crucial, just helpful... in which case it probably won't put them back 
to something resembling "equally desirable" when competing with all the 
other classes out there.
