I use Kane Bayle with my cleric and I have no problems, everyone wants
you to join a group, must be insanity on FV. For those who demand
buffs etc and are rude about it maybe your reply should be "play your
character to its abilities".  Someone mentioned on a /ooc that Kane
bayle was far more easy going than their previous server (didn't say
which though).  So not a problem I have noticed thankfully..
