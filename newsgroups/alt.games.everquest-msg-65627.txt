Actually, they should make a Linux port and then *drop* the Windows
version.

I'm serious about this.  Since they don't want you to run EQ in a
Window, and don't want you to be able to ALT-TAB out of it, they could
make a Linux version, and then ship it with a bootable Linux CD-ROM,
configured to boot, start X, and go right into EQ, and configured to
reboot when EQ exits.

This would give them complete control over the software environment EQ
runs in.
