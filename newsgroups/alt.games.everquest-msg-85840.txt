I have a human ranger from Surefall Glade and i wanna do the Trueshot
Longbow quest.   The rangers in Kelethin are a bit wary of me because
of my religion (discrimination!) or maybe I smell funny.

I heard I could raise faction by killing CrushBone Orcs (even though I
have slayed my share of East and West Commons orcs) But i was
wondering how many I would have to kill to get to where I can talk to
the rangers about the quest.  

If this is gonna take about 3 days of just trying to raise faction
before I can start I might just have to buy the durned bow,  but wat
would be the fun in that?

Thanks for the help!
