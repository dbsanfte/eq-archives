I do know that they replaced all the copper in that area about two years
ago, which was one reason the connects are so fast in that area. It's quite
possible that the telco did something or that something at the telco was
damaged when the power grid crapped out this week. I'll be out there today
to check the systems. I have a modem line I can call to access a VPN using a
direct T1 connection at the radio station for test purposes. It connects at
53333 under practically any conditions with any modem, so that will tell me
if the telco side has bugged. If there is a problem connecting there, then
something's wrong enroute or with their OS.
