I don't know about others, but this has cheating written all over it..
I could see the argument being made for using such a tool when you are
sitting in front of the computer (i would still disagree..), but
otherwise (especially leaving something like this on overnight), I
find using such tools/methods highly questionable. If I found a guild
member using such methods, I would petition with the officers to have
them removed. The same method could be used to trivialize swimming,
fishing, casting skills, melee skills, languages etc. There is a
reason the game designers don't start you off with max skill in those.
It doesn't even take all that much work to get them to max.

Personally, I even think that downloading maps is nearly cheating and
have so far refused to do so. In fact, I have learned much more about
many zones while mapping them out myself.

Ultimately it comes down to what you want from the game. But if the
working on skills, grinding, building your character over time etc. is
not what you're after, you're most likely playing the wrong game.
