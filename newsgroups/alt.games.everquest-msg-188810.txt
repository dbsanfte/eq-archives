Just wondering why no KEI and use your lizzy for additionaly regen,
seems like that would be faster?  Maybe just 'cause you are sick.  I
know I can hardly play when I'm sick, I get myself killed too easy.

Congrats.  I used to have TV and computer in same room.  Made EQ much
more bearable.  I miss it, but just don't have the room now :(

Is that a joke?  I'd rather have Ancient Aego any day, Druid buffs suck.

Normal behavior.  Mem blur usually takes 3 casts to work on anything
higher than lv 30. Or maybe it's a 1/3 chance of working every cast. 
Atone seems to work slightly better in my experience, maybe 1/2 chance
of working.  I find the line very annoying since you never know if it
worked, except on select mobs that aren't agro to begin with.  Seems
like it strips the latest agro first, very bad if you have a tank trying
to regain agro.

What?  With how uber you are (at least compared to me), I thought you'd
be playing an uber dark elf with snare clicky :)

I need to figure out how to get those faithstones for my cleric..

Thought this was how you are supposed to solo with a HL cleric anyway. 
Just wish I could find a cleric to Ageo my Enchanter as easy as I can
find an Enchanter to Kei my Cleric (or anyone else for that matter)

Acumen, not familiar with it.

Bastard Shaman.  Never have what you want.  I'm expecting them to get
Kei in a bottle before long, now that they are giving them illusions in
a bottle :(

Stupid rangers.  Only thing I've met stupider than a ranger are some of
the SKs...  Dumb as a brick and can't find their way out of a paper bag.

I prefer IR actually.  Everything looks wierd in UV, with IR you just
see the mobs really clearly, much easier to pick them out.  Congrats on
the nice item.

I'm somewhat suprised a higher end guild like that has such younger
people.  One of the people in my very small guild is 54...

Damn, you've sure got stamina, especially when sick.  I can usually only
make it an hour or two when sick.

Blind > Sick, yes.  But one's RL and the other's not. 

Get well, get some real rest.
