Yeah gods, that boob gives me the screaming heebie-jeebies. He reminds 
me of the most manipulative bastard I have ever known crossed with Ted 
Bundy. He's got serious homophobia mixed with homosexuality, control 
issues, paranoia, superiority complex crossed with small-man syndrome, 
and social phobias that I can't even begin to describe. Not everyone is 
so open about plans to breed their own cult. I suppose it's a good thing 
he's not religious or inclined to be desctructive others- although he is 
kind enough to warn about his temper...

I pray no one is stupid enough to take him up on it.
