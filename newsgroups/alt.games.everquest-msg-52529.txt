Crafted is a good step up from FP for a warrior, but going for the
BP first is going at the problem backwards.

If you look at armor in terms of difficulty or expense to acquire,
you'll almost always see the BP of the set as the hardest.

First piece I'd look at getting in crafted would be the gauntlets,
AC 12, STR +5, cost around 160pp to do yourself... and
probably about the same to buy em.

If you happen to be a small race, by the way, there's pair
of dwarves in WC who will take regular crafted (which
fits small and regular and large warriors) and give you
small crafted (fits small warriors only, but is a good deal
lighter) at no added expense.  Down side is small
crafted is harder to sell once you've outgrown it.
