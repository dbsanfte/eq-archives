Actually, that's what I meant about Carbon 14, that it can't be applied to 
anything other than organic matter... Still, I didn't know it was limited to 
around 3000 years. I was thinking it would be more like eight to ten 
thousand, so thanks for pointing that out.

Hm... Aren't you conflating that with the "Lucy" fossil from Olduvai Gorge? 
I'm pretty sure they called that fictitious ancestor "Eve", as expected. :)

Hm... I figure that the first proto-human (wherever you decide to draw the 
line) would only have its friends and neighbours to breed with, so I don't 
really see what kind of sense it makes to talk about a "generation 1". I was 
really skeptical of everything I read about that study. Human evolution was 
quick from a geological point of view, but I'm sure the grey line between 
human and non-human is several hundred generations wide.

You don't need million-year old DNA to extrapolate things like a species 
branching off another. You only need to figure out the rate at which its DNA 
mutates, count the differing base pairs in a sample segment, and pull out 
your calculator. I've read things like the split between grey and red 
squirrels being traced to about one million years ago, and I'm sure they can 
look further back.

Not to mention the fact that which books went into the Bible has always been 
a pretty arbitrary decision anyway...
