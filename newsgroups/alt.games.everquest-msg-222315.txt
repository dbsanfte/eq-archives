I recently upgraded the few EQ expansions that I had with Evolution. I
firstly unistalled the expansions I had then intalled Evolution. I noticed
that all my custom setting (friends lists, screen layouts etc.) had all
gone, but that was too much of a concern.

I have tried to 2 to LDoN adventure but in both cases can not enter the
dungeon that my group goes into. Here is is what I have managed too work
out.

1. LDoN is an enabled expansion. I can see it after the log in screen below
where it says in green "All Expansions Enabled" I click on register
expansions and can see them all listed.

2. After the first adventure problem I went and got myself the Adventures
Stone again and had it in inventory when trying to enter the dungeon on the
second adventure. Still no joy.

3. While the second mission was going on I disband from group and did a few
things. When the group succeeded I got a message to say we was successful
and got 4 adventure points. Remember I wasn't even in the zone with them...

4. I have not tried it with any other character yet so can't say if the
problem is wider than just one character.

5. I sent my first ever petition on the problem. How long does a petition
take anyway ? 1hr, 1 day 1 week ?

6. I am considering reinstalling LDoN again just to try and see. I don't
have disc for it as I ordered download from EQ, is there I way I can get it
to reinstall ?

Please help, would like to get some use out of this software I purchased.

Steve
