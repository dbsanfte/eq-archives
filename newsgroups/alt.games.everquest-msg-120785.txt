Just wanted to say I port for donations =)  Sometimes I get 2pp, sometimes
75pp (average donation I get is 40pp). I am just happy to get the donation
and if I expect to get 5pp then I am overjoyed when I get 50pp. The most I
have ever gotten was 100pp for a port to EJ. The "going rate" on my server
used to be 10-15pp but since there is so much money on the server and most
porters don't want to be bothered with porting (there will be 15 druids in a
zone and none will answer /oocs asking for a port) it is now commonplace to
see people shout for ports and offer 75pp (or more) because they need to get
to EJ or GD or somesuch. The price has gone WAY up because the porters are
either greedy or don't feel like porting. I will offer to port for a
donation (and will quote 15pp if I am pressed to give an amount). 70% of the
time I get at least twice that amount (I guess for not being greedy). Most I
have gotten for a "donation" was 150pp and some buffs...least amount is 2pp
or some buffs. I cheerfully accept whatever is given and have fun while I am
doing it :) Kinda bites when I am playing my main and SHE needs a port. Wish
I didn't have them on the same account now...
