You dont really 'need' uber stuff to level up, sure, it can help, but as you
level up you will start to make more cash anyway, once you get to around 39+
try gunthank or dulak (three of us made about 225 pp each, in about 2 hours
at dulak, mainly killing drunken pirates for shammy stoicsim quest, also
looted a mantle of stealth each).  We wasnt killing really fast because we
were (or I was), only pulling one certain type of mob, I suspect more could
be made there if just fighting 'normallly'.
