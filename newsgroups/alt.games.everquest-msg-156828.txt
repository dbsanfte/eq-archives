I was wondering if anyone knew of a place in New York City that either has
PoP already on sale (sorry, no Walmarts near me) or is planning any sort of
midnight madness?  There are a few places open past midnight that sell those
sorts of things, but they don't usually just put stuff out at midnight
unless it's part of a special promotion.

Anyone know of anything like that?

Thanks.
