Each gives you xp if it says it does and if its at least a high green.
You basically want to stick to blues to whites though. Each monster may
give a different amount but there is a max amount of xp you can get for a
kill or a quest (per kill or quest) at a particular level. It did not
used to be that way, at least for quests, and on lower level characters
you could get a HUGE amount on some bigger xp quests.

Yes, very few creatures would have been blue from five to six and likely
none except maybe a fire beetle here or there is now. You should be
fighting in EC on the wandering wolves, bears and other things, even orcs
in a group. You could
even run to rivervale through kith if you went during the day time,
then you'd do well in misty thicket.

Or you could take the boat back to where you were born since crushbone
starts getting good around then.

There really is no "training" as per your class or race. You should just
put one point into new things like channelling, meditate,  at your
trainer otherwise it doesn't matter much.
