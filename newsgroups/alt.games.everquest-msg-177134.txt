Paldual Caverns is better

However, to explain things:
Level 10 and below, you get XP at twice the rate... that went in with the
patches to make newbie life easier. Also, Blackburrow should count as a
dungeon (not absolutely sure), which doubles the amount of XP you get again,
since you are under 30 (another change they made... level<30 you get double
xp in 'dungeons'.)

Of course PC has a monstrous ZEM on it, being a Luclin zone, and also gets
the 'dungeon' and 'newbie' bonuses.
