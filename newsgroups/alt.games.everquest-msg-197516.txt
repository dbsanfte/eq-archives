As one of those with 'less traumatic' *cough* trial experiences,
here's the trick. Hit up your friends in the local uberguild. Get four
lvl 65s, 100+ AA, Vex Thal caliber equipment and getting through is a
breeze. Given the right classes among those 4 and they'll get any 2
lvl 46s through. Boy, didn't I feel special for getting through the
trials on my 2nd attempt! 

And just in case there's anyone out there that actually doesn't have
friends of that caliber willing to help (hard to believe, I know), I
hear most servers have set groups willing to get you through for plat.


Either way, you've now proved yourself better than the unwashed masses
trying to do it the hard way. Feel special yet? 

Rgds, Frank
