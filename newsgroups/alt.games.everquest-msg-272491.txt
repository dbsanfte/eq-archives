I was wondering what time zone you were in there pam? I'm on gmt +10. I
should be on tonight sometime, maybe we could group up?

On another note, I'm amazed how many quests are soloable up to a point, then
you have to either wait until the mobs gray out (thus losing any chance to
get items like the ones needed for "bark like a gnoll" or you have to get a
group. I've been loggin into blackburrow for days, trying to get a group
together to kill captain ghurox. When someone was interested, we waited 90
minutes and he didn't spawn.

Hopefully that was fixed in a patch recently, but even so, i haven't gotten
a group since then who wanted to kill him, and there's a few groups in
blackburrow who monopolise the green gnolls (to lv 20) in all the instances,
so i can never get drops for the "bark like a gnoll" quest. Neither would
they as they are too high level, so i'm not sure what they are questing for.

As a soloer, i can kill bears or wolves add infinitum, but i find so many
mobs can't be fought solo, eg casters because they can stun you and have the
rest of the mob beat you to death whilst you stand there twiddling your thum
bs. In a group, you can compensate, but I find groups only forming to fight
very specific mobs over and over. Next time i log in i guess i'll do aq1 aq2
aq3 aq4 etc etc but sheesh there's so many mobs in this game that are never
hunted.

So many things seem broken. Take tradeskill interdependencies. I need iron
sheets to make turquoise orbs. I haven't been able to sell them to pc's
despite using the second lowest price rule that works for most everything
else, so i end up selling to vendors. I offered to craft anything like
stroma oil or eolith temper, but there was no interest in trading them for
anything a 17 scholar could make. So I'm, left with levelling up an alt to
compensate. I understand some people are paying that extra cost per month to
have the extra character slots for that purpose but grinding through the
recipes again and again is such an awful thought.

There's a lot about early eq2 i loved, but the few quests that i can now
solo and the increase to grouped mobs damage output just makes me feel like
SOE hates soloers. That could be their new slogan, "SOE Slays Soloing!" They
said there were more quests for soloers but i really haven't felt any
increase was taken seriously. The paladin quest takes days solo... it took
me 30 minutes in a group.

I'm still trying to get WOW and if anyone in sydney knows a shop that might
have a copy in on sat week can they reply to this post? Floriana has first
dibs on my stuff.
