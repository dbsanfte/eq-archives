It's gutting to see a betrayal quest mob de-spawn when you've been
calling out for people to help for the last 10 minutes.  I must have
seen Dancoed of the Pine 4 or 5 times before I got someone to help me
in time.  A couple of those times I had help on the way when he
de-spawned.... that makes it even more frustrating.  Because of this I
made a point of helping *everyone* who requested help with the betrayal
mobs as long as I wasn't in a group.

I found the Nek run very easy but I had been there a lot with my level
26 assassin character so I knew the run inside out and didn't have any
problems.

It is a big pain having to rely on other people to help you before you
can progress any further.
