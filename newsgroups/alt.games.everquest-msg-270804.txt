I played a while ago into the low 50's (not really that high in AO terms)
and found I was able to solo. Like most other games it really comes down to
which class you play (Adventurers will solo better than Bureaucrats) but
every class seems like they can solo effectively. Now just *how*
effectively will most likely depend on how your IPs are spent. What I like
about the system (and what curiously bored me to tears) was the mission
generators. You could tailor something to your level and pick the type of
mission. This generally helps soloers but for me became incredibly boring
because I made the mistake of doing *only* missions. Doing that will burn
you out quick because after several of the same type of missions you'll
know the instance layout like the back of your hand and you'll get zero
challenge out of it (even on the hardest setting). My advice is to use the
missions only to spice up periods where you don't want to explore. The
planet is pretty big and they have some "hidden" areas that are nice to
explore.
