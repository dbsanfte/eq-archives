Dwarf Warriors are good but I would check out the Barbarian Warrior you will
get Slam an added attack equal to Bash but no shield required when you go
dual wield. Now to the Stats Sta will give you some extra HP (hit points)
and allow you to hold your breath longer, but the Str will increase the
amount of damage you will do after level 20 and allow you to carry more
equipment. Int and Wis will help in trade skill other then that useless. Agi
and Dex will help you learn Defensive (agi) Offensive (dex) skill quicker,
but you will still max your skills  by the end of your current level in most
instances. Agi will also add a little to your AC. Dex will also help if you
have a weapon that produces a random effect. I personally would put a 65 35
split between str and sta. Main thing to remember for a warrior AC and Str
are king.
