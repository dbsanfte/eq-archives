Hi There,

To buy in the bazaar simply type /bazaar  A new window will come up which
allows you to type in the item you are interested in or search for items by
slot, charateristic, class or race.  When you type in the item name or do
search you will be presented with a list of items.  Right clicking on the
item in the right hand pane gives you its statistics.  Right clicking on the
vendor's name faces you towards the vendor .. a bit like druid or ranger
tracking.  By moving and right clicking your perspective changes and this
will eventually lead you to the trader.  Right click on the trader and a
trade window opens just like a NPC trader.  When you decide to buy an item
the money is automatically taken from your inventory and you get the item.

To sell in the bazaar you will need to buy a trading satchel.  This is
available from the first NPC as you enter the NPC trading area on the right.
once you have the satchel transfer all of the items you wish to sell into
it.  Find a position under any of the covered areas. Type /trader  A list of
items in your trader satchel then comes up.  You must click on each of the
items for sale then enter an amount you want for them.  After you have
accepted all the values you hit "begin trader" and that is it.

Good luck

regards
@ndrew
