I just started a mage and I was wondering where i can find a list of pet
commands.  IS it in the books and I just missed it, or are you just figured
it out intuitively.  I think I might have the basics, but until I start
playing him and get to 4th level, I dont have any way to test out what I
think are the proper commands.  Thanks for any help.
