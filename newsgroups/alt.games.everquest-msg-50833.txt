Increasing the limit would make it a lot easier for some casters. Druids
could always have soc at the ready... and gate. As it is now, they have to
balance it against other spells, so there is some decision making to be
made.
My own opinion... I dont think that this decision balancing casters need to
make is worth the "out of character" clicking and time waste the person
behind the computer has to put up with. Make spell books "open", and if this
makes things easier for the casters, then nerf them some other way to
balance it. My wrists ache enough already from clicking and moving my mouse
(not kidding)
