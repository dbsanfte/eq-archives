Recently, I was wandering around Najena (near the entrance anyway),
with my 17th level troll warrior. Killing Ogre Guards, Greater
Skellies, Elementals and the odd Tentacle Terror, when a couple of 50+
level characters ran past, into the depths of the dungeon on a quest,
the next time the mobs spawned, they all appeared to have got harder.

Green spawns became light blue, white spawns became yellow etc. It
might just be a coincidence, but I have noticed the same in other
zones. Loads of monsters of a level I can deal with, then a high level
character enters the zone and all the monsters get harder.

The difference may only be slight, but since I am using a fairly low
level character it may be more noticable.

Has any one else noticed something like this?
