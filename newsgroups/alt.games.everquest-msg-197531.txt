I'm going to be stupid, and futilely stick my opinion in here.

I have two toons - a 62 wizard and a 62 chanter.  Both were flagged at level
58.  Of the two, flagging the wizard was much harder - any chanter who can
handle an overpull in Seb can do trials.  Got manapool for 24 mezzes and a
slow?

The guild I was in at the time tried the 'core group' idea to get people
through.  We built a group of five that could reliably burm through a trial
successfully if the 6th person took a nap.  This core group was NOT able to
get the whole guild flagged, however.  Let's do some math...

Weekdays, in the 3 hours between logging on and logging off (assuming you
work for a living), it's possible to win Exe 6 times, once every half hour.
This assumes that no other guild is doing the same thing you are, of course,
and that you win every time you try.  /chuckle  So realistically, if you and
one other guild are doing this and alternating wins, you can flag 3 people a
night, if you succeed every time.  If three guilds are doing this, you'll
flag 1 or 2 people a night.

I play on Xegony, a long-established server.  We have DOZENS of guilds who
are trying to flag people.  Flagging 1 or 2 people a night is a good night,
means the line is short.  So you're asking five of your guild's best people
to skip tonights raids, tradeskilling, XP, everything they want to do to sit
for three hours a night to flag one person.  Do this for two weeks, and one
of them will opt out, guaranteed - and now you have a slot to fill in your
core group.

Now lets' address that one person getting flagged.  Which one?  Our guild
used to joke we were bigger than China - we had 160 MAINS at one point, 140
who played regularly, 110 who were 55 plus level.  (Yes, we could have
formed more than one core group, and did.  Since only one group can win at a
time, it's irrelevant on how many people get flagged per night.)  So how do
you pick which person would walk through?  Tempers flared, folks felt
slighted if you didn't flag them next, accusations of preferential treatment
were leveled at members of the core group and the guild officers for wanting
their friends flagged.  Some very good friends of mine had an IRL fight that
almost broke them up over one being flagged early, and the other late.  Both
ended up leaving EQ for good, to save their relationship.

My point, in this rambling, low-caffeine post?  That the restrictions on how
often the trials that can be won by a reasonable guild cause too much stress
for most guilds to survive - as mine didn't.
