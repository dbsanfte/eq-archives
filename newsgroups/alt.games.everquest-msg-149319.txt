Why include both CoD *and* DDD? Wouldn't it be better to just twist
the higher damage of the two twice in the three-song twist...

...or include it three times even?

All sound like good ideas. Thank you. It is evident that the bard
class is going to require much more practice than any other class I've
played if I want to be all I can be. That's fine. The extra mile never
scares me off.  :)
