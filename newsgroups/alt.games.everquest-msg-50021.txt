I would just hop off the boat as soon as it zones in, and start running to
the pot room, the ship(s) take forever to get moving after zoning, and you
won't save time by waiting as far as I can tell.  I have been using the pot
room for about 10 levels now, I have yet to see Faydedar.  There are two
Faydedar's, a triggered version, and a normal spawn version, the spawn time
is really long, and AFAIK does not last long, the triggered version does not
last long, as generally some druid is working on his epic, and needs that
one.  So far it appears to not be a real issue.  Look on www.eqatlas.com for
a listing of which pot goes where (south left is Halas).  Worst case, you
get killed by Faydedar, and end up back in FV, time to try again.  Hasn't
happened to me yet, I don't dawdle, I swim down, into the pot room, double
click the desired pot, and am gone.  I don't know exactly where Faydedar
hangs out, other than in the vicinity of the pot room.
