Two more to add: heals and run speed enhancement (sow, selo's, etc), at the
very least self-only for the puller.  You can of course keep chugging SoW
potions, but that's gonna be expensive at lower lvls.

This is probably how I'd do it:
Shadow Knight for MT, FD pull.
Cleric to heal.
Enchanter for slows, debuffs, hastes, mind buffs, crowd control.
Beastlord for dmg dealing and later mind buffs.
Druid for evac/ports, minor dmg dealing, tracking, dmg shield, sow, snare,
backup healing.

My best advice: draw straws (/rand, whatever) for the order you'll pick your
class (to avoid dupes), and don't force anybody to be a class they don't
want to be.  I've been in some _very_ interesting groups before and a
complete blast.
