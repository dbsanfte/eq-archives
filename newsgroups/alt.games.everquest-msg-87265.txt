There's class armour qith quests: Shamen get Mystic Scale, Warriors can
do Trooper Scale quests. Both have plate look and are slightly better than
banded and have stats. Iksar can wear banded as well. There's also
player made iskar armour, cabilis scale, imbued cabilis scale etc.
Iksar can not wear most plate armours.

Level 1-5 newbie area
Level 5-10 Pit area
Level 10-16 Tower of Kurns
Level 16-19 Outside Kurns
Level 19-30 Lake of ill omen
Level 30-40 Frontier Mountains/Overthere
Level 40-50 Karnors - even to 60
or Chardok/Burning Wood etc

Trooper Shesthar (sp?) in one of the east cab exita (swamp?) makes
a helmet for you.

: All in all, I wish I'd started a lizard a long time ago. Lots of fun!

My preferred race :P Be preparred to not be able to buy food or
train anywhere.
