I read an interesting tidbit on the monkly-business message board.. on the
test server you can now buy the equivalent of Jboots from the same vendor
that sells the 100% weight reducing bag (tinkerers). I believe the price is
in the same range as the bag.. around 5200pp. I don't know the whole "story"
on this.. but I'd certainly wait a bit before shelling out any cash for
Jboots.
