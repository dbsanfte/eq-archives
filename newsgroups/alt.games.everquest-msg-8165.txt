The Weighted Axe is actually 45 150, but it has many uses. First of
all, as an opening attack, I double hit for 250+ regularly. The magic
number for a weapon is 2*weapon rating + level damage bonus. For two
handed weapons with a delay greater than 40, there is a bonus based on
the delay. For the Weighted axe, the level damage bonus is 42 at level
31. So, it would hit for 132 most often.

I got the most use out of the axe was when fighting giants in the
Frontier Mountains. I would pull with SoW, charge into the fort,
double hit for 250, then turn autoattack off, run back to the party
and double attack again for 250. Then, I would switch in my regular
weapon and fight normally, but against a giant who has already taken
500 damage. It also shoots the warrior way up the hate list, making
holding aggro quite easy.

In my lower 30s, I played a lot with kiting mobs. I could easily kite
a Cyclops, whack it, turn auto off, flee until auto ungreyed, then
return to whack. Going toe to toe with a Cyclops and normal weapons I
was about equal. I could usually solo one, but sometimes not. Using
the axe and SoW, I could solo one and never suffer more than 1-2
bubbles of damage.

Recently, I have been teaming up with a Cleric, he roots the mob, I
whack it, back off, wait for auto and repeat. Against a Kobold in Sol
B I can barely solo the normal way I take less than a bubble of
damage. In fact we kill several without any healing so that I can go
berserk, a crippling blow is truly impressive, I have hit one for 381
damage, part of a double attack with 172. 553 damage in a single swing
is a beautiful thing. Best normal critical was 325. We also killed a
couple Sand Giants this way, though it really isn't an effective tool
against giants. This is due to their very large hit range, they
usually get a couple swings before I can get in melee range, and
another as I leave it.

Generally, I just keep it in my inventory and use it for the first
swing. Due to a strange feature of the way weapons work, the cycle
timer on weapons "forgets" that I just swung a 150 delay weapon, and
when I switch in my 22 delay weapon it starts swinging right away.

The main reasons the axe is so cheap is it is large race only, and it
really isn't a useful melee weapon, it only has certain very specific
uses. Most people aren't willing to waste 9.4 wt of inventory for
something of limited use. BTW, it is the best PK weapon a warrior can
use. I killed a player in three swings once :)
