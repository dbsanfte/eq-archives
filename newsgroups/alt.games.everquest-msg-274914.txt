I hope this is true, as it would mean they read my mind. I love the EQ2 
graphics, and while EQ2 itself is a good game, I'd always choose EQ1's 
gameplay over EQ2...my exception being that, as shallow as this is, EQ2 
is a lot easier on the eye. In fact in some ways it's literally easier 
on the eye, as EQ1 seems to bring me out in headaches quite easily, and 
I've noticed this may be because I'm having trouble adjusting gamma to a 
suitable level for my vision to accomodate comfortably. It's either too 
bright or too dark :-(

However I've strayed from the point, if that many zones could be 
converted to the way Lavastorm is right now, it would give me a great 
incentive to spend a little more time in the game. Like I said, shallow 
but true. That said, I don't consider Lavastorm to be "in line with 
EQ2", even though it is a great improvement.

Of course, this could lead me to debate why I spend my time in a game I 
consider somewhat inferior to it's predecessor instead of putting time 
into the game I prefer :-) Think that's for a different post.
