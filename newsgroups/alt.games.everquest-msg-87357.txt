I use him often when doing an outdoors xp grind.  Puller pulls (whomever),
druid snares, I tash then immediately sit.  He hits me, I run away then cast
Fear.

Tried using him in ME when it was just me, a mage, a necro and a cleric but
it didn't work out as well.  I may try it again though.

Oh, my enc is 56
