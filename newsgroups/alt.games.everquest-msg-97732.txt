It is not my fault if you haven't seen them.

http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&oe=ISO-8859-1&q=spellbook+meditating+sit&btnG=Google+Search&meta=group%3Dalt.games.everquest.*

Sorry I know that will wrap weird, but its a long URL. Of the 38 posts
from the search, 5 were offtopic, 1 was positive, and 32 were
extremely (and I mean EXTREMELY) negative. The seach was for
spellbook, meditating, and sit. And I did it in this newsgroup, a
hotbed of EQ fanaticism. If I ran the same one on sissypig it would be
100% negative, because there's where the actually objective people
would respond at.

This is in THIS newsgroup, Lokari. You've been around here as long as
I have. Did you really miss them?

This moron above you did.

Consider it done. I apologize if you think I was dodging it. The
majority is impossible to prove but I can get it to acceptable
percentage points variance, 19 times out of 20.

It's at the feet of the first one to be a complete idiot, like the
twit who said "prove it" like it was some kind of fantastic
revalation.
