They did expand the "light blue" range from the "exp-giving greens"
quite a bit, at the high end anyway. My main is level 53; previously
everything below level 39 or 40 (not sure which) was green. Now,
level 35 mobs e.g. Butcherblock dwarves are light blue.

A friend who is level 57 told me that some hill giants are now light 
blue for him. Hill giants are level 37 max. That's a big spread.
