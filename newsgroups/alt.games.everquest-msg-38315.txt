I've heard this term lately applied to the new zone
as well as the Luclin package. From what I can gather
this is a new policy where a MOB that is trivial to kill
will either have nothing on it or you'll be unable to loot it ?
Where does that leave Druids looking for bat wings for lev
or Necros looking for bones for pets ? Will this be back-fitted
into old zones ? Any solid info would be appreciated.
