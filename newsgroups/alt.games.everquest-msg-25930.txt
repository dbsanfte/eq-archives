If someone in the group needs an item that drops, why wouldnt they get first
crack? It only makes sense.  Too many greedy wimps play this game.
Fortunately, I have managed to avoid most of em....)

The easiest way to tell if your group has one is when they insist on rollin
for items they cant use when another group member can...

These kind of people get disbanded immediately...then you hear em whinin
because they cant find a group...hehe...word gets around....surely does.
Most dont find out till it is too late that soloin after 40 sucks.
