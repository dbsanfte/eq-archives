a great majority of them camp for decayed, I'm positive, my main is a
shadowknight who spent a few levels in CT, I know several SK's who feel
exactly the same...... its bad enough that Crusaders are hard to find, but
to have to compete with someone who has no use for the armor other than to
make pp that could be made elsewhere kind of pisses me off..... its
Shadowknight Quest Armor, not druid/pally/ranger etc commodities...... and
it should be questable only by shadowknights. nothing would please me more
than seeing a pile of pasty faced white elves, asslings and treehugger
corpses piled up in front of the UK in Sol  :)

most SK's that try to get into groups in there dont loot a single thing
except the decayed just so they are able to get grouped

its Everquest, it shouldnt be

and I've seen the "virtual" expressions of people who were finally able to
complete their quest, on their own, without having to buy the
components.......   pride in accomplishment ...... to me, thats the game...
and when that happens, it rocks
