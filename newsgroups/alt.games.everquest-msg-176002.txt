How does this hurt? I mean if you make items cheaper then ppl can get some
nice gear, and you can get outta trader mode.  Greed really drives bazaar
prices more than we all like, so why not try to make the items available to
all?  I know plenty of ppl who *give* it away if they can't use it rather
than sell it.

Since there is no *real* cost, you can sell most items for whatever you'd
like.  Supply and demand do play a big part, but consider how the "accepted"
price is set and how they change so fast (lamentation was 8-10k, now 1-2k).

I price to sell fast so I don't waste time AFK in /trader mode..
