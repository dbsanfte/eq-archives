LDoN dungeons are specifically "tuned" to provide an appropriate
challenge for the group.  (At least that's the claim.)

How do you create a mob that's "tuned" for a group that contains,
say, a 52 warrior and a 65 warrior?  I don't think you can.  Either
the 52 is going to whiff the entire fight, or the 65 will have a
cakewalk.
