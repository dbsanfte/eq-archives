I don't think Lance was suggesting that skillups were based on standing
there looking pretty while someone else kills the mob, nor even that it
would work to do most of the damage with a "real" weapon and then swap
in the practice weapon for the kill-shot.  He's just saying that he can
get a mob to where it will run in place (snared) and then wail away at
it with the practice weapon, taking lots of swings and hopefully getting
lots of skillups.  Certainly I've done that myself at various times.

The catch is that you really do have to HIT with the weapon.  I knew from
previous log parses that offense/defense skillups only come when you hit
or are missed, respectively, but I wasn't sure about weapon skills.  I went
back and looked at those, and sure enough, all of my weapon skillups,
including Bash, have come only when I actually hit.  (Taunt, on the other
hand, can go up even on a failure.)  And of course, the hit has to be vs a
non-green mob, so you really don't want to let the skills get too far
behind or it's hard to find mobs that you can hit well enough to practice
on.

What I don't know is whether you actually have to do damage.  I.e., if the
mob is invulnerable, can you still get skillups?  Maybe Lance can do the
experiment and report back!
