I don't bother with haste.  Its too much effort (short duration spell) for
me to remember to keep up, especially when im running at least 1 other
character (sometimes 2 others)

Even a slowed mob does big damage when hitting for 200+ a pop, I require a
cheal usually every fight, sometimes 2 a fight, sometimes a cheal every 2
mobs.

Sometimes we have an add (or repop on top of us) and the shaman always needs
healing after maloing+slowing

Sometimes the mobs don't slow (keep resisting) etc

Thats 1 fight which is typically over inside 1-3 minutes.. kindof big
difference in comparison to a continous pull exp group.  And im sure you had
KEI/C2 and bard mana song playing.

Or is in a competent group, with well equipped people for the camp.  4
characters (3 people) inside Kael arena isn't overkill, I could easily kill
in Velk/Sebilis with a kill rate 10-20 times faster with the same group
setup (solo in velks, it takes me typically from 40seconds to just over 1
minute to kill most spiders
