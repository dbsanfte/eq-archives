So what if that was its intention? Its still broken. Categorically 
stupid even.

As a significant side effect its gone and allowed the casuals with high 
level friends and alts of high levels a new quick way to get flags.

If you simply happen to know people with flags then its easy to get 
them. If you don't its *much* tougher.

Can you imagine if LDoN worked like that... If you group with someone 
with 1000s of points you get 1000s of points after completing an 
adventure. Or Kunark... if you group with someone with their epic you 
can do a little quick shortcut quest to get your own. Or Luclin... if 
you know someone with their VT key you can skip camping the shards doing 
emperor and just do a little turn in quest with the luclinite instead...

Sure these all would have been convenient for high level guilds with new 
members...

The trouble should be obvious though. Making a shortcut quest that you 
can do if you "know" somebody, however makes it more effiecient for up 
and coming guilds and players to NOT do things on their own, but instead 
beg higher level players to gimp them through the shortcuts.

PoP flags are worse than all my examples because they are such a 
gigantic shortcut that its orders of magnitude more efficient to get 
gimped through the side quest with some high level friends than to 
progress with your own guild.
