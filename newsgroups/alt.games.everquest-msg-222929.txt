From a role-playing perspective (this was a role-playing game at one
time, wasn't it?) the sense heading skill never made sense. Presumably
our characters at level one are 'grown up' enough to life a sword or a
stick or what have you. That is, prior to becoming adventurers, they
were already residents of the world.

I was able to determine which way was north when I was a kid. Why
wouldn't a citizen or Norrath have the same ability by the time she's
ready to start whacking rats outside Freeport?

>Being LOST is kind of fun. Immersive even.

Quite true - some of my fondest memories are of getting lost in
Butcherblock the first week the game was out. I found myself at the
entrance to Dagnor's, had no clue where I was, and all I could think
was "Oh, crap, I'm in it now!". Knowing which way was north wouldn't
have made me less lost really. Without a map, compass points are only
vaguely useful.
