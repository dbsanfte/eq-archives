I prefer either random or the master list method. Keep a list of who asked
for and received loot , if multiple people ask for something its easy just
reward the one who has spent spent the longest time since the last award.
Easier then a point system by far and spreads the loot far more since your
purchasing power increases with time.

We still use the best kiss ass method though 8/
