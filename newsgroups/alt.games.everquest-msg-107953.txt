The Bracelet of Sense fills that slot for good.  From the standpoint
strictly of WIS, resists and AC, you're not going to get a better item
for one of your wrists, at least not until Planes of Power is released.
The only better one* is Camii's Bracer of Vigor which drops from
Vulak in NToV.  And since you need two wrist items.... ;)

I wouldn't pay 30kpp for anything I could get with a single group
either, but that's true for a Jade Reaver too.

*weighted towards WIS, then resists, then AC.  15 WIS with resists
and decent, but not spectacular, AC makes up for a lot of mid-level
gear elsewhere.
