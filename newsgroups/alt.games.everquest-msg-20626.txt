When zone was repopulated after patch corpse was placed improperly and
then moved to safe spot or similar would explain the movement of the
corpse.  Is the brunette the default face for WE male/female as applies
to your char?  Corpses are often set to default after zone reset,
meaning that a fully dressed corpse can and will appear to be naked and
having the default face for that race/sex combination, which has
resulted in a great deal of wear and tear on this old man's heart I can
tell you.  Only thing I can't explain is an extra pack on the corpse,
I'll leave that up to the conspiracy theorists, but my guess is Brad
tossed that in special for you just to drive you nuts <EG>.
