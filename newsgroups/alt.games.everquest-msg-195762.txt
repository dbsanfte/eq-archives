On the rare occaison I plonk someone who's a local, I do them the courtesy
of sending in a plonk message.  Let's them know not to bother to reply, and
lets them know that they're free to plonk me as well.

Rest assured, if I plonk you, you're plonked.  This ng has too much traffic
for me to bother with getting headers from someone who's proven themselves
to be witless insofar as I'm concerned.

Crossposters get plonked without ceremony.
