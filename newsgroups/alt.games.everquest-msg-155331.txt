True enough when the recipient is a Druid or Wizard.  For a hybrid, or
a non-porting caster there is almost no value to Clarity or C2 received
in Nexus unless you're grouped with a porter.  KEI, on the other hand,
lasts long enough for you to hope to get some use out of it.  For me,
while the advantage of KEI is substantial enough to pay for it, there
is no certainty that I can get to a suitable hunting ground (i.e. good
enough xp and/or loot PLUS not too crowded) quickly enough to make it
worth the expense, so I never do.  I've had it on a couple raids (my
guild leader is a 60 Enchanter), on the occasions where I've run into
my GL in Nexus, and once when somebody MGB'd it, normally I just do
without.

OTOH, if I had a second account with a porter-bot like some folks I
know, things would be much different.  For one thing I'd have to spend
a lot more time hunting HGs in Rathe Mtns to pay for all the KEIs.

I think anyone who evaluates everybody else as if they had port
capability on demand (required to make C1/C2 cast in Nexus valuable
unless you're hunting adjacent Luclin zones) is spoiled.  :-p
