 I can solo the shrooms pretty easily in FG. Most everything else hits
too hard and has too many HP. Of course they no longer drop spells from
what I understand so that's not too helpful to someone looking for
spells. 

 A high-level caster may be able to find camps that can be single pulled
although most of the ones I have encountered had some nasty chain-aggro.
At those places I'd think Root/Dot would work fairly well.
