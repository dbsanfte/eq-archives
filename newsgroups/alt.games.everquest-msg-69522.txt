    I KNEW if I "egged" him on he'd test it for me! 8)

    Don't cats hate water? Maybe they drown faster than other races, rather
than Iksar drowning slower. Better check!  8)

    It appears that they hold their breath as a max-STA character. You'd
need a max-STA character to test, of course, like a shaman with buffs or
Ben's ogre WAR. But I'm willing to bet that's the case.

    That sounds suspicious, somehow. Was there any lag? Do you have a record
of exactly how much damage as a percent of total HPs the second Iksar took?
Dan's testing indicated you take a fixed percentage of HPs in damage per
"drowning pulse", and I can't imagine why they'd code that to vary with STA
on Iksars.

>But there you have it. I was dead wrong.

    Bah, you just remembered wrong. There's a ton of data on Usenet, and you
can't always remember it all. Just trying to list all of Bizbee's stalkers
could take a ton of grey matter!
