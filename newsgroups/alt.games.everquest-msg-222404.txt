It's the risk of root breaking before the main tank establishes agro,
at which point you have a slowed mob beating on the enchanter for a
few seconds (hopefully an enchanter that's standing close to the tanks
so no ping-pong).

Assuming the enchanter is smart enough to slow any mezzed mobs, I just
don't see it as a problem. If he isn't tough enough to handle a few
hits, he's not tough enough to deal with a couple of intial mez
resists so it's a moot point.

Teach your enchanters where to stand on mez break.

Enchanters don't die on mez breaks, at least as long as the group is
smart enough to take mobs one at a time and not break mez before the
mob is slowed. Enchanters die due to inital mez resists.

<Shrug> I disagree but as I've stated elsewhere in this thread, I just
prefer not to bother with mez.  It's one of the nice things about LDoN
though, there isn't one strategy or 'perfect' group that you need to
win. I think they did an excellent job of balancing things for
multiple group makeups and strategies. 

If MJ (Padder) is reading this, I'd be interested to know what she
thinks. She's done maybe 10 LDoN groups with me where we never use mez
and I wonder how those compare to her other groups. 

Rgds, Frank
