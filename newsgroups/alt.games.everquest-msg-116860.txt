Shrug. I bought my level 10 necromancer a horse ;) Its pretty ;)

Anyway, if you're not kitting out from a level 60's funds then I'd
suggest going and hunting yourself some rygor armour in EW, its
pretty decent, get yourself a snazzy bow playermade, at low levels
they're killer as you're not supposed to have them yet, and for
weapons.. hmm.. I'm tempted to say a wurmslayer/centi weapon
(whatever the cheapest one hander is) pair, but that assumes
you're going to level up to dual wield and past the damage cap ;)

Haste is going to be too expensive for a while, as is real jewellery,
so a pair of jagged bands for your fingers or some of the no stats
lots of HP rings that go pretty cheap (efreeti ring, a few others).

Look for cheap +HP stuff... when you only have 100 hp a 50hp item
is a huge gain ;)

Might want to go hunt in runnyeye for a blackened alloy crown or
longsword as well...
