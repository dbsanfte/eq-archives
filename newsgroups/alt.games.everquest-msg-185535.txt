    Interesting. The patch that fixed this happened a long time ago. Maybe
they only fixed the elven slave so he wouldn't attack. He was the big
problem because any of the races hunting in Crushbone (good races, by and
large) wouldn't want to kill him and take the faction hit against Kelethin.
Sounds like it's time for a bug report. Like the one I filed last night. Has
anyone else EVER found a PC that didn't show up in the zone when you do a
/whot on them?
