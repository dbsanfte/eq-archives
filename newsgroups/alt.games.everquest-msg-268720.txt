All i'm currently interested in is crafting bakpacks. Do i need to buy a
recipe book from a pc to get better 'spells' to increase durability etc or
will the 'spells' i have acquired do?I think they were aquired from just
levelling but might have come with the storebought recipes, i never thought
to check.

Eski, 13 brawler, 12 outfitter (i think, system down, hard to check, and the
heat here has fried my brain).
