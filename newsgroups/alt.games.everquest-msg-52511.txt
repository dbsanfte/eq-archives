On a slightly different note, but still with weapon bonuses in mind. Does
the weapon bonus only apply to 2HS, or does it apply to all 2-handed
weapons? Also, if it applies to 2HB in addition to 2HS, will it also apply
to my druid's Staff of the Earthcrafter, or is it just a warrior weapon
bonus? Ok, I realise I should probably know this info by now, but any
comments welcome.
