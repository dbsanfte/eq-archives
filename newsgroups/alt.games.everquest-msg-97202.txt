And I'd also like to add, you can buy "classic everquest" which has enough
of the game for you to be able to play it for months for $9.99 at most
computer stores... they even give it out free in some magazines. Comes with
a free month of play also. After that you will have to pay $9.89 a month to
continue playing.

So if you can't afford 10 bucks to buy it, you can't afford the 10 bucks to
play it, so even *IF* someone were to give you a key (which no one ever will
since they only work once), you'd still have to pay to play.
