Greetings,

I got my ass handed to me in ME last night.

I sat my 54 Pally down in the NW corner of the zone, to the left of the DS ZI.  I made
sure that the spot wasn't a spawn point, or too near a Goranga path.  Once everything
looked safe, I ran my friend's 57 Chanter in for a little 2-box action.  I've used this
Pally/Chanter duo to great effect in The Hole - 2 XP levels worth of effect for the Pally,
in fact.

Pally pulled with Flame of Light.  Could've used arrows, sure, but he'd just had some
fresh mind candy - so why not vent some mana..!  Single pull, piece of cake.  Pally melee
with LBoV & Tae Ew Shield.  DPS looks about right.  Chanter slows with Forlorn Deeds, and
debuffs with Weakness.  Wait for it, wait for it - MOB @ 75% HP - Chanter tosses off
Discordant Mind.

Boom, the MOB drops 528HP, and the Chanter draws aggro as the reward.  WOW.  Well, okay,
this happened very, very rarely in The Hole, but I learned how to handle it: Pally
taunt-bash-QWoS-instill and stand on top of the MOB while the Chanter backs off.  This
quickly gets aggro back where it belongs.

Then, ADD 1.  And a few seconds later, ADD TOTAL 2.  Even though the Pally has aggro,
these adds hate the Chanter.  Can't get a GoK off through the dmg.  Pally QWoS one of the
mobs, Instills another while both PCs back away, but there's one more that isn't listening
to the Pally's blade, so it's Chanter down real quick.  Ah, he's an HP gimp, anyway ;->

Pally train out with an /ooc.  Camp Pally.  Run my friend's clicky Cleric over for the
Chanter rez.  A quick round of logins gets V onto the Pally and the Chanter.

Try another pull.  Good kill.  Try another...good, also.  Try a third...looking better and
better...then, add - on the chanter.  WTF.  He didn't even do anything to the add.  He
almost certainly wasn't within aggro range of the path.  I've had enough.  Chanter zone
out with an /ooc.

Pally gets more attention than he can handle.  Clicky cleric rescue #2.  Gate to PoK for
the casters, a jog home for the hybrid.

You'd think that I'd just chosen a bad place to set up camp, but I'm pretty sure I was
golden.

So what's the dillio?  Do I just absolutely suck at 2-boxing, or is ME nigh on
unmanageable for a 2-person group at this level?

Heh - if you say that I suck at 2-boxing, you have to tell me "why."  Cheap shots need not
apply. ;->

Best regards,

Tim ==
