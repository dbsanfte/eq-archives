That as maybe, but personally raiding is the only thing that keeps me going 
in EQ these days, and I can say that for alot of my fellow guildmates.

When you (I) start plyaing a game you  want to get to the top end...seeing 
that top end constantly shifting (loot, gear etc) erodes some of the reasons 
why you play. It's frustrating seeing your current foci that you paid hard 
earned DKP for become obsolete every leveling expansion.

Now I just get immense satisfaction from beating  those bosses with my 
guildies, alot of whom are my friends both in RL and I spoes to an extent 
GameLife.
