Normally this isn't something I'd do. But, well, I'm going to outline
the changes we're making to this quest in rather close detail. But
first, let me try to explain the concern that players had with this
quest.
With arguably the most popular Epic Quest item, the Cleric trying to
gain his Epic item usually finds plenty of people to help in the
process. Clerics are commonly the first in line with guilds to help
with their epic quests. So Clerics tend to get further in their epic
quest faster than many others. This has lead to a very nasty
'bottleneck' for Clerics trying to complete the quest. The Ragefire
portion of the quest has been creating a lot of static among players.

So we have decided to make a change to the end portion of this quest.
To reduce confusion and to help people understand why we're making
this change, I'm going to give out a few specific details. These
changes will go Live with the patch tonight.

For those that are not interested in quest details, consider the rest
of this post SPOILER INFORMATION:

First, the 'merchant' version of Zordak will now appear at a different
location in SoldungB. He will appear once each day (except after a
server comes down, then he will spawn in one to three days). The
appearance of this NPC will no longer require the absence of Lord
Nagafen.

The cleric still turns in his Shimmering Pearl to Zordak. But now the
merchant Zordak will return a Swirling Pearl to the Cleric and
disappear.

At that point the Cleric will need to head out and look for him. A
killable version of Zordak will appear independent of the pearl
turn-in every few days (except after a server goes down, then he will
appear a little faster). Killing Zordak will transform him into dragon
form, and the Cleric (with help�) must kill him immediately.

The new dragon Zordak will drop a heart that is a container that
requires the Swirling Pearl to be combined in it to create the Heart
that is turned in to Omat.

The rest of the quest remains the same.

The goal of these changes is to reduce the problems with the
bottleneck that existed before. They will not remove that bottleneck,
but hopefully will remove the nasty competition for a single spawn
with so many people willing to be� rude to each other.

More Ragefire spawns can't be anything but good, but I have to imagine
that this is going to cause at least as many problems as it solves.
The #1 ubergriefer guild on our server has already ganked Ragefire
once this month. This may well lead them to try to unilaterally
declare him FCFS and, with the possibility of both the red dragon
scale (warrior/bard epic) and the Cloak of Flames (36% haste) dropping
off of a relatively easy dragon that can be done by 53+ types, there
are plenty of compelling reasons to hunt him besides the cleric epic.
