And since you asked about endgame - in the really high-end stuff, the
clerics are mostly stuck on CH chain keeping the MT propped up.  If the
soft, squishy robed types get hit by being on the Rampage list, or an AOE,
then it's usually a druid or shaman healing.  The flexibility to have
someone who can port to raids, port non-porting classes out of raids (though
the wizard spell Teleport has reduced this somewhat), Succor yourself to
zoneline to CoH latecomers, drop quite respectable nukes, debuff Fire Resist
(if you can take the aggro heat), and heal the non-tanks makes a druid quite
welcome.
