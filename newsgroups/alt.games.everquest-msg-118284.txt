I wish they left this open for fun reasons though.  Like the people who hand
bard instruments to all of the NPCs in a certain area, or you kill a snake
to find a few swords in it's mouth, or looting wolf and lion meats from
bears (or even role play it a bit and put racial recipes on them to look as
if they had the remains of their last kill).
    Also trying to be nice (I guess you could call it role-play), a certain
barbarian female who wonders out in the open parts of Everfrost, often gets
attacked, and I've seen her killed a few times by pretty low LV NPCs.  I've
often given her a decent weapon and a torch (she would complain of the cold
when you talked to her).  After that, not only could someone spot he more
easily (though I guess giving someone a torch in a dangerous area they need
to hide in is more like sneaking up on someone in the forest while wearing
bright orange), but she could now defend herself a little more as well, and
wouldn't die near as often.
    I do see why they added this, for the people who accidentally give an
NPC an item, or to prevent someone from giving the orcs in EC velium
weapons, though it does take away some fun from the game.
