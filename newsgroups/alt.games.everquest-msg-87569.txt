OK, I'm glad that someone else came up with 4Xnecro.  Necro groups are 
insanely overpowered at lower levels, and they are the only 'solo' class 
that can really do dungeons before they green out.  I would probably 
recommend a necro, necro, necro, druid though, for the evac capability.  
The undead dungeons where necros really get sick sometime require an evac, 
though with 4 necros I guess you would all just feign.
If you're going for a tank group though, I would go rouge, sk, shaman, 
bard.  You have a feign puller/tank, a damage dealer/lockpick/CR buddy, a 
haster/slower/buffer/healer, and a CC/manapump/buffer who does decent 
damage.  This will probably give you the best all around access up through 
level 50.  You don't need a warrior until then, and shammy healing is more 
than good enough with a slowed mob.  The whole enchanter/bard thing is a 
non-issue.  One is a whiny, skirt-wearing finger-wiggler; the other is an 
self-contained entertainment complex and train waiting to happen.
