I would be surprised. The simple reasoning being that, although it
would appear simple enough to code for the additional graphics load
(possibly even eliminating it - I'm and applications developer, not
games, so I could be wrong), what I have seen from EQ indicates that
it employs very inefficient methods where 3D rendering is concerned.
My only evidence of this is the fact that many other games manage
similar object rendering with far fewer resources.

This may cause a second instance of EQ running to impose a significant
addition in resouce need/utilization, especially when the second
instance would be running the most congested zone in the game - the
Bazaar.
