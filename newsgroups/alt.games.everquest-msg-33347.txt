Me personaly, I use a   /assist %t
This makes it so I dont have to rewrite it for every group.... it also
works twofold.... 
I assist Tank..... and target the enemy... Party member getting bashed
and losing health, I assist the monster... which usualy will put me on
target of the individual losing health.

No rewriting for me....  ( and my assist has attack off, because Im a
Cleric, I dont often need to attack the target.)
