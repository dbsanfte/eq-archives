Ok, got the patch on the Dell Inspiron 8000.  It has an ATI Rage
Mobility 128 video card.  Got the latest video drivers from ATI. 
Finally, finally, at long last got all the patch files and now can
play.  Now the screen in-game is very dark (playing with the gama
correction does not help), and whenever I try to move things in my
inventory, as soon as I switch back to full screen all the over-lay
windows have turned grey.  Unusable.  Anyone else with this problem...
or better yet, anyone else SOLVE this problem?

It all worked so nicely before.
