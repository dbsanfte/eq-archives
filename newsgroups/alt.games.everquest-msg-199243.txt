You sat and looked at your spellbook!  At 35 you could finally sit and
admire the sceanery.  Really exciting stuff!!!

Make a "prue" caster class, lvl it to around 13/14 and go to Oasis and join
an Orc hwy group.  About the 2nd or 3rd time your killed by multiple adds
because you didn't have SOE you might re-think your position.

Yea and I solo'd my Shammy to 56 and only died 3 or 4 times but the PoP game
is a whole different story.  When mobs are hitting the tanks for 300+ a pop
and your in a full group with 2 melee's fighting a "slow" resisting mob with
around 8000 +/- HP's you'll have KEI or you'll ge LFG a lot!

So whats that have to do with KEI?  BTW, I'd rather have that than the
claric who waits until your down to one bar of health before he begings
casting that (around 10 sec. or something) complete heal on my Shammy with a
total of 2951 HP's after Claric buffs!!!  When your down to about 590 HP's
in PoI/N/J/D (only zones I've played in so far) you can loose 590 HP's in
litterally 3 or 4 wacks... which take, Oh, maybe 5 sec. tops!
