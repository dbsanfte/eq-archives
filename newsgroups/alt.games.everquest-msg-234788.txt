I'm a newb but this is my take on it.  I guess you could say I've chosen 
the Test server as my home world.

It is significantly better than what has been.  But there are still a 
few bugs to be worked out.  I just bug reported a pottery recipe that 
would not show on the learned recipe list.  In order to use that recipe 
you still had to use the original tradeskill UI (now called Experiment).
