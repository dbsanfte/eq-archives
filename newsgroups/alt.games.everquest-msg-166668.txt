Hmmm I just did one from account to account, on the same server on
sunday and its still not done today tuesday at roughly noon. 

I reread it though and saw something that disturbed me. It sais
something like transfers will not be made to an account during the
free month. The account I was transferring FROM was as old as the
game, while the account I'm transferring TO I just made for this
purpose. I did as it said and gave it all of the expansions since the
other account had them (bleah.. another 64 bucks.) I hope that the
account transferring TO does not have the non free month limit
otherwise I'll be waiting a WHOLE MONTH for this transfer.

All I received so far was the email saying they received the request.
I have not been charged the 50 bucks yet.

I had to enter in my credit card number on the transfer page
and billing info. It said that if the billing info is diff from your
account(s) to explain why. Of course my name and info on both accounts
are the same, with different login names of course.
