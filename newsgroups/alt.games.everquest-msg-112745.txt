	A "standard" experience group has plenty of downtime.

	It would all depend on the situation.  99 times out of 100 though, it
won't matter either way.

|That is an XP grind, that is efficiency, and that is the one situation in
|the game where a wizard blows enormous chunks.

	The latter would be nice, but it is so rare as to be effectively
nonexistent.  The vast majority of the time you simply don't have access to an
all-you-can-eat spawn.  Someone else will be camping the areas near you, and
if you pull "their" mobs you'll get bitched at.  Frinstance, yesterday I took
a guild group out to Akheva to try for the Cloak of Truth bits.  Akehva is one
of the most desolate undercamped areas in the entire game, and we STILL could
not have pulled continuously because there was a group right behind us.  

	When I am pulling in most areas, it's no trick for me to get all the mobs
in reach into camp ASAP.  If I did that, though, we'd chew through them and
then either have to wait on respawns (boring) or poach someone else's camp
(and I won't, it's antisocial at the least).  So I'll figure out how many mobs
we have in "our" area and space out the pulls so we're not bored.  Leaves
plenty of meditation time for the casters.

|Again, the folks at Graffe's
|did analysis after analysis, including certain amounts of down time and
|looking at how much down time was in those classic "constant pull" groups.
|And the answer is always the same - they come up very short.

	Which means they're crocking the analysis to only include data that
supports their point -- classic technique.

|    No, meaning I won't invite the New Jersey to participate in my small
|battle. And if all we ever do is small battles, the crew of the New Jersey
|is going to feel pretty damn useless.

	If there is going to be a "battleship" class in the game, players of that
class will have to deal with its limitations, same as everyone else.  We all
have to live with the fact that sometimes our class is not the right tool for
the job.  How is the fact that Wizards are inefficient in a situation that is
very uncommon at best any more significant than the fact that (say) I only
make a good puller indoors when I can split things by level?  That Monk who
outdamages me by 50% makes a better puller indoors too (and soon outdoors, as
the Harmony nerfage continues).

|    This, I agree with. I don't think the class that is one of the most
|wanted at level 60 for raids, and the class that is amongst the best
|soloers, and the class that is the centrepiece of the most efficient XP
|group in the game can argue that they deserve to be great in standard XP
|groups, too. But I think they do have a valid point about how flat their
|damage is between 51 and 59, or how they lack damage at lower levels when
|soloing and AoE grouping isn't much of an option.

	Frankly, I don't see a problem.  I think a lot of people play Wizards who
probably shouldn't.

|    Actually, you're wrong. They wanted to prove they were worth it in XP
|groups so they could get rid of all the bad press surrounding wizards.
|Asking for improvements is a long, generally fruitless task - witness your
|class and how long it took to get a miserable 20 Defense points.

	Rangers had to deal with someone with an attitude problem at Verant.  No
idea who it was, but someone, somewhere, decided that Rangers were going to
work with a 200 Defense at 60 and they were going to PROVE IT, come hell or
high water.  Casters in general and Wizards in particular don't have this
problem.  Rangers also had to deal with being fighters (casters are favored
over fighters), hybrids (pure fighters are favored over hybrids) and Rangers
(meaning, they have no idea what to do with us).

|    So you're saying that your XP grind groups kill more mobs per unit time
|when you replace a melee damage dealer with a wizard?

	I'm saying it doesn't matter in the vast majority of situations.

|    Would you let your cleric tank a mob? Would it be terribly efficient?
|It's not much different from letting the ranger tank.

	Oh, yes it is.  Don't exaggerate. Clerics are on a much worse table.

|assuming they can hold aggro. You folks don't need AC, despite how you've
|cried and wailed for it. You need *hit points*, so a CH can at least come
|close to being as effective on you as it is on other classes. As it is now
|you have Bard HPs, and that doesn't cut it.

	We know about the hit point disparity.  HP's can be had on lots of items;
AC was harder to get.

	In any case, I've tanked Sebilis with a Druid healing, Fungus with a Necro
healing, and Gorangas in Maiden's with an ENCHANTER healing, so I'm really not
too concerned that CH is not *as* effective on Rangers as Clerics would like.
