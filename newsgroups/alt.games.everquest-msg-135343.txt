<snip tale of loss>

Hi, I have a 23 Necro, complete with Lesser Summon Corpse*, on AB - Send me
a tell in game and I'll help you.

Um, send tells to the following chars:

Ozzar (the Necro)
Jintle
Eppin

If you contact me before 7pm BST before I start doing guild stuff (and you
have the coffin, I don't know which one - I think its the cheap stackable
one) I'll meet you somewhere around the Freeport/Commons area and you can
show me the way.

If our paths don't cross, good luck anyway ;-)

* According to Castersrealm this should work since you're below 35 -
hopefully if I'm wrong someone will point it out.
