Why ?
I snare then dot so that I have time to dot while the now-slow mob runs
towards me. Also if snare does not stick I can often get a second shot
off. This means that I don't have to go running off all over the zone
getting adds.

Of cause it is not as important as you want the Mob to hit you.

Hurumph I guess I have answered my own question.
You want the Dot from the start and you only need the snare when the mob
starts to run.

I will shut my trap till I have thought about something in future.

Wait a min this is a post so I can stop typing any time.
