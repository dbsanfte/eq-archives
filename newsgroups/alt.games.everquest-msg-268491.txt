Oh, forgot this. But, of course, that also leads to problems like I
have with the word Armageddon. I saw it in books many, many times
before I ever remember hearing it pronounced and, to this day, I have
to think carefully before I say it out loud. If I don't, I go back
to my 'reading pronounciation' rather than the correct one. :)
