Scenario.1

 Raid is happening and Ubermob_01 dies. On the loot list is Breastplate of
Uberness. Two equal LVL tanks are present on raid. One tank attends every
raid and is usually MA, BP is an upgrade to him. Tank2 attends some raids.
Tank 1 has more event points because of his attendance in helping the guild
raids so outbids tank 2. Tank 1 becomes stronger and can therefore tank
better against Nextubermob and so the guild becomes stronger collectively
and can increase the scope of
high end mob targets and in so doing eventually Tank2 becomes better
equipped.

Scenario. 2

Same as above but the two tanks /random. Weak tank 2 wins BP and remains
weaker than Tank1. Tank 2 goes off wearing his shiny new BP and comes on
another raid later on in the month maybe. Result Guild is still not any
stronger.

Event lotto points remain the best system for high end game loot
distribution. Bidding at high level is usually done sensibly. Most guild
members will not bid on an item they don't really need if to another guild
member  its a huge upgrade. Common sense is usually in play and l33t Whores
don't figure as that type of person is not usually in a high level guild.
