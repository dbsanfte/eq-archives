Ah, you've just taken your first step.

Basically, there's nothing special you need to do.  This is just one of many
flags you'll need to get to the Elemental planes.  You'll need all of the
following:

Grummus
Carpin
Terris Thule
Agnarr
All three of the Halls of Honor trials
Mithaniel Marr
The Keeper of Souls
Saryn
Tallon Zek
Vallon Zek
Rallos Zek the Warlord

So, basically, just mentally check Tallon Zek off of your list of "Flags
needed".  You still have a bunch more to go.

When you get all those flags... then you have some tasks to do to get it all
straightened out.  Come back to us then.  =)
