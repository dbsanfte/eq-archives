But the problem is
    a) not everyone has luclin (and shouldn't need it just to sell goods)
     b) it's not all that easy travelling to and fro from the bazaar for
most characters. Sure, it's a free port to the nexus but luclin is pretty
much port free, so it's actually easier to go west commons and run to the
tunnel, then gate back to grimling forest, for example.

Unless they create new druid rings or firepot-equivalents for the
non-porters, the bazaar is not all that accessible.
