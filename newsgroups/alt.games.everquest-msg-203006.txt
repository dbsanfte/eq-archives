Sure it is.  All the operations Jim used are introduced in 3rd Grade
(at least in the public schools where I live).  Filling in Jim's table
based on a description of the table column/row contents would make a
reasonable "challenge"-level arithmetic word problem for 5th graders
(and it'd be challenge-level only because there are 5 columns with
different rules for each, not because any of the rules are tough).
