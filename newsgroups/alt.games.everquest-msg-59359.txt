Take a look at what song bards get at level 60.  The senior bard in my
guild is level 60, and more than willing to do silly things with me.
That's why we're bards.  Well, that and our natural inclination to run
like a frightened schoolgirl when things get ugly.  If you check the
PoM boards there have been folks other than monks flopping who have
made the run, in fact a group of 6 zerged it.
I really really wish that bards had better int though, since a
significant number of high-level bards seem to take tactics and
strategy a LOT more seriously than the average high level player.
I've also seen bards as guildleaders probably 5 times as often as
class distribution would predict, but maybe that's just on Inny.  It's
just tough organizing raids when the damn ogre warriors are teasing
you about their INT being higher than yours.
