I think people consider the next patch to be indicitive of a "slippery
slope" not because of the changes in and of themselves, but of the
fact that so many of these changes are being put into effect at once
and so suddenly.  That is more for a sign itself more than the changes
going in.  And why, I think, people are concerned.
