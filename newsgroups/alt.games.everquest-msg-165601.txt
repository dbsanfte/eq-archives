FD is an ability that necros and shadowknights get too...

How does that make *MONKS* "virtually unkillable"?  This was a discussion
about monks strengths, not the use/power of feign death.

As for "few problems".. shrug, sometimes death just happens.  FD can fail 3
times in a row.  Sometimes it only needs to fail once for you to die (think
stunned on an AoW pull)

I would say im a pretty skilled monk at the high-end game.. and my last
death?  2 days ago...
