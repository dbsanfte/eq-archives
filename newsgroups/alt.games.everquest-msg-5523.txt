What I find interesting is that both you and Sword are so intent upon
drawing attention away from what Zeppo did, or more specifically, that
you'd rather point fingers at someone else than state an opinion on
what Zeppo was doing.

>I didn't see it. Is there a difference?

I just searched through the 5590 message headers that my newsreader
has, and found one instance of Matt telling some moron to go away
(there may be more - I have several entire threads kill filed because
they were obviously too infected by the kids of FAg to be worth
reading). That compares to many, many messages where he participates
in a useful way in the newsgroup.

*Every* recent post of Zeppo's, on the other hand, was identical and
clearly stalking DT. Which is a shame, because his early posts
actually were participatory.

No doubt you and Sword will both insist that it's the exact same
thing. Knock yourselves out.
