"Thundercat" is not marginal. :(  It is a current registered trademark as a
fictional/typed drawing and character name.

"Thundercats" would actually be okay, believe it or not.  The trademark on
this was cancelled in February 1993.

Replying to you message only because I was more curious of whatever became
of the Thundercats that my younger brother so avidly watched, during a time
of only one television.  <grin>  Found the results interesting.

Mana-Lope.  My guess the person is an equestrian.  Still, not in violation
as you say.  Reminds me of cantelope which I'm hungry for now.  Nothing
more. ;)
