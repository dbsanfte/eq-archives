One? <grin>

Great!  Now I can actually participate in a raid vice trying to get in for
10 minutes after the fact. ;p

Oh boy.

> - Pets no longer pace. Pets will now, when close to you, STOP.

Extremely annoying for when I would play my Enchanter, using the broad
camera view but more especially SOUND to hear adds.  Now, if only they would
make familiar flapping wings shut the hell up.

Ewww, I can only imagine how many farmers THIS has and will piss off, more
so those that actually WAITED for the servers to come up, as they do
adamently.

<shrug> Never had that problem.  I keep track of my inventory and find it
hard to fill 6 tinkerers, one rallec pack and a nil box.

Nice.  The information was already stored so why not show us.  Simple
implimentation that I know =I've= been /f'ing about for atleast a year.

> - Characters below level eight will no longer see light blue cons

Question is, will the "cons" see THEM.  <grin>  Oh boy, I hope not, else its
going to make for an interesting day, not to mention something to the effect
of <SYSTEM MESSAGE>  Servers will be brought down for an emergency patch in
15 minutes!

Then 4 minutes later they'll shut down.

Okay, this only affected me twice.  Once before the bug was known and second
while in gfay with auctions blurring my screen, I ran through the spires in
the middle of the transportation.

Oh. This should make CoM raids a bit easier, just to name one.

> - Gating when in the same zone that you are bound no longer causes
problems

Or egressing for that matter.  Nothing like egressing to a "safe point" then
not being able to cast while surrounded by "friends." ;p

Screw horses.

OMFG.  OMFG.  Sounds as if they finally have a pro-druid programmer on
board.

Some?


Aye, they were hard at work on this one.  Kudo's to VI.  Perhaps EQ's fate
isn't as some forseen it.  We shall see.
