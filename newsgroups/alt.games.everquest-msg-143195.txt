Gee, you think all those weapons being supplied by outside
forces had something to do with the USSR's problems in
Afghanistan?

Of course it is.  Or do you believe that all those Stinger
missles were lying around in Afghan citizen's closets, unused
for years until they were needed?  Or that the weapons supplied
across the Pakistan border at the time weren't needed because
Joe Average had a full auto weapon and a couple of hundred
rounds of ammunition for it?

Popular uprisings against oppressive regimes, the criteria of the
initial statement, have succeeded due to moral force resulting in
the loss by the government of control of its own army.  I sure
can't think of one that did so because of the citizen's access to
weaponry.  So give me an example of one that did succeed, simply
because the citizenry rose in *armed* rebellion supplied by the
weapons they had on-hand.
