Well, I've pretty much solo'd to 57 and now have been more actively trying
to get into groups for fun and a bit of a change. I have read that on raids
and some groups, the roll of a necro is the so called "mana battery", but
ever since KEI, this seems to be moot. I have on occasion twitched the
healer in my group, but only to get things going again. I find myself being
a slower (PoN) and mezzer these days on top of providing another tank and
casting the dots and nukes I'd be doing normally as if I were solo'ing. I've
even played back-up healer, lol. The new group "tap" buffs are nice. The
melee's seem to like degeneration (30 STA, 30 STR tap) if there isn't a
shammy and I sometimes do the 35 to attack buff one. I am also trying to get
the group lifetap one from the LoY expansion (300hp for the group).

As far what spells to have memmed. I'm sure you know by now, that depends on
the zone, situation, etc. For example. In a recent group in PoJ, I played
chanter. Pretty much just mezzed the many adds we got, feigning death to
clear aggro and kept the pet busy assisting the MA. I got off a DoT here and
there, but mainly just used screaming terror, FD and life tap. But in PoN,
we were doing banshee's and I really only used Shackle of bone, FD and exile
undead nuke. In both situations, I kept twitch and root up just in case,
and at least one other fast dot. Also, I would try to get darkness loaded if
there wasn't a snarer in the group. Hope this helps a little. GL! ;)
