i didn't say i own the content, i said i own the copy of it and i'm
free to do with it what i please so long as not violating the law

using what's on that CD in a different way is *not* making an illegal
copy, it's using the copy i paid for

i'm going to borrow from your frustration and give up trying to

so you're saying what's wrong is making a derivative work, NOT running
EQ itself privately

thus, i could do this with an emulated server, but i couldn't use
custom quests, i'd only be able to use what was stock

sorry i wasn't around to make a prompt response, but since i read your
last post (this one i'm responding to now), i'm understanding that you
are actually blending "copy" and "derivative work" in your
argument ... you're just plain wrong about the copying and it's clear
as day - i purchased a copy and i'm allowed to use it in different
ways; that's sound in the law

the derivative work thing, though, is where i'm suddenly hung up ...
it seems like i *may be* wrong, but you didn't explain it or
understand why

i don't know what the law is about derivative works, and i said that i
think way up at the top of this thread

THAT is going to be where i'm shown to be breaking the law with my
idea, if anywhere

then i disagree with your characterization ... but who cares?

i think you're right, but because it's a "derivative work"

i also think i'll stick to being "morally decrepit" by doing this
anyway, since the fact that it's on a private server means no one will
ever know about it except the >10 people i invite to play through
custom campaigns

plus sony isn't being harmed in any way


and i'm not a lawyer, so i don't know if the fact that it's private
and not meant to be for profit or as a substitute for actual eq (all
the players would be ex-eq1 players) constitute a "fair use" exception
or anything

and you don't either

again, the fact that i'm not making a copy is why it took so long for
me to recast your comments in a way that make sense and have validity

it's the derivative work bit, i think, that's got me snagged, not the
copying

i did ask you several times to explain yourself, and you failed to,
but you arrived at what i now think is the right answer

it seems i could have done all the work and had as much reward if i
would have just kept talking to pallindrome
