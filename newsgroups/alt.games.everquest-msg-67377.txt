You didn't mention what your system looks like.   Assuming you have a new
gaming system (1000MHz+, 512MB Ram, 64MB video) I would suggest the Trilogy
and the Shadows of Luclin expansion.

I'd also suggest you wait a week or so...a lot of bugs have come out with
the new expansion that they're really working hard on.  It'll probably be a
week before you have a relatively painless first install.
