I don't see it so much as competing as just keeping up. The new player 
will play levels 1-20, watching so many of those players they happen to 
group with along the way leave them in the dust due to much better gear. 
Granted, a knowledge of the game contributes as well, but the benefits 
of grossly exaggerated mana/hp levels cannot be overstated.

I can certainly see where that would be discouraging to many new 
players. It would be tough to trudge through the game while everyone you 
see around you (briefly) at the same level has it so much better. 

The standard has plainly been raised.
