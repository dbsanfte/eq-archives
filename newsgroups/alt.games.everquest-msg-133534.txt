Do yourself a favor at look at what you need to do to complete the Shawl 
quest before you start. Ran into a guy on my server who wanted a pot 
made, so started to talk to him about shawl. Turn out hes trying to make 
the 3rd one on 80 baking.
Talk a little more and find out he have NO idea what hes doing, no idea 
on tradeskills, and think that him at level 31, and 2 level 60 friends 
mean that he can do it easily. Had "all the hard parts" which by his 
definition were 1 wurm bile and 5 silks.
Told him that it would probably be faster to level up and get a drop 
from CT with FT1 than to get the shawl. He replies hes too low for that.
Then try to tell him about the POTC earring with FT1. Tell him it cost 
around 20K for all 9 gifts on our server. Too expensive he anwer. Left 
him to his delusions after that.
