Sorry, I must have _totally_ missed that one.  Last I heard, Warcraft 3,
where it was supposed to be some orc character going through a series of
personal quests (original screen shots I saw looked like Escape From Monkey
Island with Orcs instead of Pirates) was canned.

If it was a interview at the WoW site, then I didn't see it.  I have a very
slow connection, and avoid downloading video whenever possible.
