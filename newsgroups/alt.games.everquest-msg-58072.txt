You have to love posts that start out like this. Ah well, here we go
again.

Well, you go on later to say they are the "second best", so I'm assuming
that you're agreeing that warriors are the best MA Tanks, so I've no
clue where your "complete crap" etc. bullshit is spewing from. SK's,
Paladins, even Rangers and the occasional ubertwinked monk *can* be fine
MA Tanks. But if there's a well played, decently equipped warrior around
of comparable level, you're going to take them. That's why you'd "hope"
the SK wouldn't be stuck as MA too often. They aren't the optimum
choice.

Ummmmm...... again. I'm sure you're totally right. Who the fuck was
talking about pullers? You pulled *one* line out of my response which
was entirely about tuanting skills and went off on this halfassed rant.
Now your exhorting the glories of SKs because you play one? SK's are
great. Nobody was pissing in your face as an SK. All classes have their
place and their own skills. So they're great pullers. This has *what* to
do with using your taunt skill again?

See above. Second best. Thanks. 'nuff said.

Which post are you responding to? I'm not currently playing anything
near 42. My highest is a troll champion, so yes, I've seen them. *sigh*.
(Why do I see a dick waving contest coming about how uber this guy is?)
But mostly I'm playing a baby necro these days. What the fuck are you
going on about again?

Well, I guess you *were* powerleveled quite a bit, weren't you? Fighting
lvl 50 mobs at level six and endless streams of reds might have left you
not much opportunity to learn the SK in group strategies. Personally, in
a non ubertwink group particularly, if I'm MA Tank and I have an SK in
there that keeps hitting the taunt button, drawing aggro, and splitting
up the clerics healing mana, etc. between two people just to "keep their
skill maxed" they get kicked out of the group after one warning. Max
your skill while you're soloing or when you're MA when no tank is
around. Otherwise you're just fucking up the group.

I've heard of that one, and it sounds like it works great. Never tried
it though. I should on my non-tank alts. But on the warrior I never had
to worry about it. You taunt so much Sense heading is always maxed
anyway.

Most of the well equipped 50+ SKs outdamage my warrior, so I really have
to work to max my taunt and hold aggro. Of course, if you are comparing
your damage output to your monk's, and not to a warriors, then you're
pointlessly bitching about nothing. Your SK isn't designed to lay out
the damage that monks and rogues do. That's not is place in The VISION
(tm).
