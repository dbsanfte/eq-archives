So am I, but this doesn't strike me as bad. I'm pay 15/month for EQ2.
For six bucks more, I get EQ1 and 4 more slots, not that I'm likely to
use them. I think this is more a "bonus" for Staton Pass subscribers
than anything else. Anyone who already plays EQ1 and EQ2 would be a
moron NOT to use the Station pass. This gives an incentive to keep
both games open (so the account totals in EQ1 don't plunge). I
honestly think this has more to do with keeping EQ1 subscriptions up
(via the Station Pass) than it does with pure squeezing every dollar
out of the suckers.

Of course, half my guild went "Oooo! Gonna get that!" 

Me, I rarely do alts. I had to make a Ratonga, though....kawaii!
