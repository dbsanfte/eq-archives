I was looking for a nice earring for my wizard friend and saw an "Ivandyr's
Hoop" using /bazaar.  It showed 6 charges of some spell.  Imagine my surprise /
shock when I finally fought the lag to get to her, only to find that when I
clicked on it *in her inventory* it showed "NO CHARGES".   I clicked on her a
couple more times to compare it to the /bazaar listing, then used /ooc to
confirm that the item was, no doubt, out of charges.  I still debated buying
it, because of the intelligence, but the seller wanted a LOT of money for it.  
Then I was more than a little pissed.  Not that it was the seller's fault, its
a /bazaar thing.  Totally a situation of "let the buyer beware".
