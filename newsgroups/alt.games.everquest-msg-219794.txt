Been playing AO myself lately and find it much better (fun) than
either. Looks like most of the bugs are worked out and the game play
is very good. If you like LDoN then give AO a try it implemented much
better in AO with the Solo missions and about 30-60 minutes of
realtime play to complete. Keeping my wizzie on Xev jic but doubt if I
will come back to SoE unless EQ2 really pans out.
