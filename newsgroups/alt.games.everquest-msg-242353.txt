I'm sure you're welcome to as much of the credit as you want. :)  But I'll 
take a share if you don't.

Yea, but 'what they say' hardly ever happens. :)

Whatcha wanna do?  Many things can be done much faster than you may be 
used to thinking.  Well, once they're done patching, anyway. :)

}> Naw.  Past history shows that most invocations of 'there should be a FAQ!'

}I always kept newsgroup politics out of the faq, and confined my flamewars

True, you did.  Not everyone was as well-behaved.

}I will certainly be reading this new faq, especially if there is a section
}on LDON.

I think I saw at least a brief one there.

On another note, long time no see, and welcome back, and all that stuff.
