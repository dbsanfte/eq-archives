Endless hairsplitting over biological definitions of what constitutes a
human being can come to no resolution of the argument.  It must move to
another level of consideration--the teleological and the sociological.
Teleogy is a consideration of ends, results, outcomes and effects as those
proceed logically, in this case, from some action, specifically the
legalization of abortion.

In this way a pro-life person will observe that the social, the teleological
effect of legal abortion has been to define a human embryo as something less
than human, or something only potentially human, but in that, not actually
human in an embryonic or fetal form.

The pro-life person observes that this is old hat.  Nazis did that with
Jews, Nazi Bigots still do it with Negroes--to say that they are not
actually human in the same way an "Aryan" is human.  Now it is done with the
new "nigger" a human embryo and fetus and what is the result?  We learn it
is possible to split a hair about what is human and what is not.  The notion
of what is *human* is no longer sacred, untouchable, inviolate and
immutable--a hair may be split and we may say of this individual which
displays all the DNA which identifies that individual as "human", that it
may really not be human. It can have human DNA and not be human.  Okay that
goes hand in hand with the new Junk Science Psychology that looks for
genetic causes of mental illness and criminality:  some people are not
really, which is to say ideally "human".  Some are genetic kooks or
crooks--others are the nice white meat type folks.

Take that whole contemporary gestalt of perspective and put it in the
streets, in the police department and in the high school.  Those kids who
come dressed in black are not really human, for after all they don't act and
think and dress like us so don't we already have a precedent for making a
distinction?  Sure!  We know that something can have human DNA, can look
human, but may be treated as subhuman.  The kids in black are ostracized,
and the next thing you know they come to school with guns and start shooting
every Preppy in sight just to give them an idea of how it feels.  And why is
that so easy?  Because beings with human DNA are flushed down the toilet
every day:  that's what can be done with human DNA.  That's the end result
of talking about something that is "potentially" human.  That's teleology
pointing to a sociological necessity, a scientific necessity of making
abortion illegal.  Abortion is socially irrational, no matter what people
may say on the biological level, the proof of the matter is revealed, the
hair-splitting is shown to be illogical, irrational and wrong because the
result of it in the precedent of thought it sets is so obviously
wrong--especially as perceived by the young who grow up never knowing a time
when abortion was illegal, never having a chance to live in the social
ecology that defined it unequivocally as shameful, cowardly, irresponsible,
selfish and just plain murder.

When human life is no longer deemed sacred, which means human in its every
stage and form--or it is not sacred which means to be absolutely untouchable
so long as it is innocent of murder or crimes deemed equally heinous.
Otherwise when there is so much as one exception, then it is no longer
sacred, untouchable and becomes expendable in its every form, in the police
station, where the broken broom handles are used, and in the high school
where you can say, "That person could just as well have been aborted and
flushed down the hole.  Why not kill him now--what's the diff?"
