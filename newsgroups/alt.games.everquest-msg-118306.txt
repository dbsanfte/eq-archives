Nexus -> Shadowhaven -> Echo Caverns via the "secret" entrance -> necro vendor.
Check http://www.eqatlas.com for maps of SH and EC, they'll show you exactly
what you need to know. You might need to do some faction work to buy from the
necro vendor but that's relatively easy now that you have Gather Shadows. OR,
just get someone to buy it for you.

Don't worry about it, just run straight through the middle of the Paineel newbie
yard archway. The guards have a VERY small aggro radius. You might have to watch
out for Noclin but he's usually close to the wall on the left.

Bind at the fountain outside the Warrens zone. Gather shadows and go in to recon
the mobs. The kobolds near the entrance are probably green so you might have to
move in a little. Remember that your pet will probably be lower level than you
and will draw aggro from things that are green to you, so leave him in the grave
until you've gotten comfortable with where you'll be hunting.

A lot of bronze drops in that zone, some of which sells for a couple of plat. Be
prepared for frequent trips to the druid in Toxx. Skip the Bronze Tantos,
though, you'll only get a couple of gold for those and they're heavy. Also,
don't be too proud to loot corpses left behind by faction farmers, sometimes it
looks like a kobold bomb went off down there.
