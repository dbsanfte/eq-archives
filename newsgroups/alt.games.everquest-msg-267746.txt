I've seen enchanters go into this using their high level mezzes that chew up
their mana and go OOM while I'm sitting at 95% mana in another corner.
These spiders are AOE Mezzable ( get a DoT bracelet and DoT yourself if
you're worried about Mezzing yourself ) and low enough to use a low-mana mez
( Entrance? ) on.  Maybe GoK is needed, but I think Entrance was the one I
used - it's been too long.

A Chanter / Druid duo is great for the corners.
