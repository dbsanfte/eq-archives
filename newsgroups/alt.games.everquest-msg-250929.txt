Unfortunately I haven't seen the 20 minute reel myself, I"ve only seen the
cgi movie trailer that I know is *part* of it. The question is whether
what you are describing is that trailer, or something else.

The simple way to answer it is this question: Was the female caster of the
group in a full-coverage robe or was she sporting a little loincloth and
midriff top, with cleavage and navel showing in all it's glory? Cuz if you
saw lots of skin, it was a cgi trailer. If she was dressed like someone
from a monastary, it was in-game footage.  (Well, ok, there was ONE
in-game outfit showing skin, that little aqua and silver outfit. But the
one from teh cgi trailer was a purple and gold dealie.) Oh, and if anyone
was wearing a cape/cloak it was the cgi trailer.
