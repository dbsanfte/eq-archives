Happens on all servers. We lost quite a few members to a server jump when
the new Ubisoft servers opened. they jumped ship to join a guild that was
long done with VT and into Elementals and we were just starting VT. We now
have a sturdy membership that won't jump ship. Tried RZtW for first time
yesterday and got him to 43%, we are all going to progress through content
together and not skip.
