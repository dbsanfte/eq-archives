I was talking with an enchanter last night, and it occured to us that it 
might be interesting to have a mage charm a pet, then use Burnout V on 
it, break charm, and have the enchanter DC it.

Of course a lot of people never even bother buying DC anymore as it 
become useless fairly rapidly.  And Burnout only lasts so long, while 
the enchanter can keep reapplying SOV or whatever.

SO its probably a silly idea.

But we were wondering where it would be possible even to try, given the 
minimum level an enchanter has to be to buy DC in the first place, where 
can he still get exp with this plan?
