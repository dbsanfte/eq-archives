Here are the some fictional ones I saw posted a while ago:

Her: "How can you just sit there for hours and hours
and play that stupid game?"

Me: "Gee honey I don't know probably the same way
you can read those stupid trash novels for hours and
hours? Or watch TV for hours and hours?"
(we all know how intellectual TV is don't we?)


Her: "I spent all day doing the laundry and you just come
home and plop down in front of that stupid computer"

Me: "You're right dear I don't do anything at work
except screw the secretaries and sleep. BTW you
don't do the laundry the washing machine does it,
its not like you go down to the river and beat it on
rock."
