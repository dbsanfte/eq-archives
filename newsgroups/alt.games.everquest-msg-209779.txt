Just curious...which Epics are schedulable?  I'm not sure that's a real
word, so I'd better explain what I mean.

If a particular fight in an Epic is triggered, or if the mob has a fast
spawning placeholder and doesn't usually take too long to spawn, and the
Epic mob always drops its Epic piece, that part schedulable.  You can say to
your guild or friends, "I need help on this particular date at this
particular time for this reasonable number of hours to do this step of my
Epic" and if they guild or friends show up, you will be able to do that
step, unless you wipe.

I'd call an Epic schedulable if all the fights and steps are either
schedulable or can be reasonably done solo by the person doing the Epic, or
at most with a small group.

So, which Epics are schedulable?  I think the Cleric Epic might be, but
haven't looked at all the steps.  I know there are a couple long boring
camps, but I think those are doable solo or by a small group.  Same with
getting shards to trigger Ragefire.

The Wizard Epic is not schedulable.  All three of its fights involve
catching a non-triggered mob up, and two of them don't always drop their
epic pieces.  Getting the Wizard Epic involved getting guild/friends to show
up many many times to kill in places they would otherwise have no interest
in.

I hope that in EQ2, they are more uniform in this.  I think all major quests
should be schedulable.
