After work on my shamans alchemy skill (160, go my girlf!) hes now able to
make DS potions.

I made myself a few stacks of "Kilva's Skin of Flame" potions, the intention
being to speed up my kill-rates in my HoH groups..

Well upcon casting one, I find out to my horror that it doesn't stack with
the Coldain 10th Ring buff (frostreavers blessing)..  /sigh

Based purely on DPS, which is going to give the best results, seens as I can
only use one of the 2?

Potion: 33point DS
Ring: 10point DS, 10regen/tick, 10ATK

Im always tanking for my group, there is always a shaman there (mobs are
always slowed), and the zone in question is Halls of Honour (the black mobs
mitigate slow, the humans slow fully)

Thoughts on which would be the higher DMG output?

Also.. theres 2 diff DS potions, the second one I know doesnt stack with
10th ring.. but does anybody know for the blistering flesh DS?
