When the people are willing to admit that they don't know. You do the
best you can to muddle through but are willing to keep your eyes open
and learn things along the way. My main problem with the religions I'm
familiar with is their inability to say 'I don't know" when it comes
to the big questions. I don't think I'm smarter than anyone else (well
ok, a couple of people :p) but I also don't think that people like
<insert your favorite religious leader here> have any special insight
either. It's a pretty safe assumption that anyone claiming to be
talking to God or in his name is either delusional or a con artist. 

Heh, how's that for flame bait as I head out for the weekend? :p
