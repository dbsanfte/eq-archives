Not shooting the messenger by any means, but I have a legitimate question
here...

Wasn't the whole Mana Regen thing one of the big bonus things that Sony used
well before the horses actually went live?

It is fuzzy to me since it was probably a year or more from the time horses
went live until I finally bought my first mount (Drogmor) and during that year
I was away from the game for a stretch of a few months.  

I could swear though, that part of the 'sell' for mounts was not only the no
'sit aggro', but the whole medding while you move.  Otherwise, what was the
real point or benefit to putting them in?

Thanks for any input,

Joolz
