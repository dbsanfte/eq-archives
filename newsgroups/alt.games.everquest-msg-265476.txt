Strip clubs, at least where I live, generally don't meet #3 of the above
reasons why churches are used.

I went to kindergarten in a church, through the public school system.  I
doubt that is done anymore, but the reasons behind it were much the same.

You seem to misunderstand the constitutional "separation of church and
state" concept.  The government is prohibited from *endorsing* a religion. 
It isn't prohibited from accepting donations (which I'm sure is the case
with the voting locations).  The mere fact that churches of various sects
are used makes it clear that there is no endorsement being made.
