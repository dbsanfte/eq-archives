Wait until you meet my character; Level 37, leader of a good guild and
still I have no idea what is going on (I think this how I got the
job!) and am wandering about Norrath totally enjoying myself with no
shoes, nothing in the bank and a weapon which may only just frighten a
small beetle.

But, what the heck even after a year or so I am still enjying myself.
And that's the whole point, isn't it?
