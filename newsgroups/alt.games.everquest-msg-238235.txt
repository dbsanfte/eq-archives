The mobs don't aggro the closest person, but from what I have seen on
various raids there, they always aggro the -same- person.  Two raids ago,
every split mob aggroed me.  On our last raid there, they all aggroed a
Wizard in our raid - no matter where he was.  I would make him stand a good
50 yards away and they would still beeline for him.  I had been under the
impression that they were coded to eat a/the chanter first ( I was the only
chanter on the raid where I got all the aggro ), but that was obviously
wrong.  After thinking about why it would choose the Wizard this time, I
remembered he was the last one in zone since he had to go down and pot
someone up ( who zones faster than he ).  My guess is they aggro the last
Player Character that zoned in based on very little evidence.

Next PoSky raid you guys do, pay attention to the very last person who zones
in, or camp someone and have them come back in and see if this is correct.
