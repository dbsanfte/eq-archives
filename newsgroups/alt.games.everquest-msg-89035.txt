i'm playing on a P3-733,256, Ati rage crappy pro thing and find it
"playable" (just)

I run at 800*600 ,all detail down NO LUCLIN INSTALLED (that would be kicking
the arse out of it)

Because my main (desktop) machine is s**t-hot i just use the laptop for
simple things (practising smithing ,low detail areas (crushbone) etc)

because the spec of laptop you are on about is way past what i have ,i have
no reason to suggest it wouldn't run just fine

The G2go is pretty darn good (for a laptop) and about average for a
desktop,however if you marry it with a fastish processor (1gig plus) and
512mb of ram it'll do a pretty fine job imho

DO NOT TRY using the touchpad/joystick it's crap at the best of times (as
you say it's not exactly a big job to attach a mouse is it!!)

good luck and enjoy
