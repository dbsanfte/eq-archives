"GetsumJ made a post and did quite a bit of bragging about
how he was the best"

Re read my original post and get back to me with where you get your
information. It obviously was not from here dude.

If your going to quote, try and get the facts straight.

No offense, but I still think that people who buy characters have an
inferiority complex which was the body of my original post. Then I get
pounced on for having an ego problem, yet no one addressed the original
opinion.
Why? Because they buy characters and have to verbally attack anyone who
expresses an opinion on their choices. I think they call that an
"Inferiority Complex".

Now, I attack back because its human nature. What really cracked me up was
the references made to "Small Penis Jokes" another "Inferiority Complex"?

 Like I said, I play hardball, I just have much more class about it then
most who replied. I can say big boy trashy crap like any sailor, but what's
the point? To trade licks with the lesser IQs?  I think not :-)

Try this on .
My name is James
I live in Irving Texas (pleeeaaaseee come kick my ass LOL)
I own 3 new cars, 2 new Jetski's , building my second home, married to the
same wonderful woman for 14 years, have 3 great boys, same profession for
another 14 years and probably make more in a week then bizbee's mom does on
the corner in a year.

But what's the point? I coulda made all that shit up. You'll never know and
if you claim to know me at all by what I write, you probably need to get
more outta life then what you read in here.

What does all this babble mean ?

Many in here have an "Inferiority Complex" like I set from the beginning.

If you bought a higher level character, then I respect you less then I do a
level 1 coming out of Freeport. At least he is trying and works his way to
the top, not buy it just to be accepted.

Case dismissed :-)

Have a Nice day !!!!!!
