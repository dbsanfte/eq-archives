If you're hunting wisps in WC rather than the island in Erud's crossing,
you will find Synthan at the gypsy camp in Oasis of Marr much closer.
She doesn't give responses to hails like Myrsila, but she gives exactly
the same xp and rewards for handing stuff in nonetheless.

Those of evil alignment can get the same deal from the Dark Elf Smith
T'vysa in South Ro.

Hmm, not sure how you wangled that one - I was getting a few sp for the
research books as opposed to about 8 or 9 gold for a lightstone. The xp
from turning in the lightstones more than makes up for the 7 or 8 gold
lost, however, but I would start selling the regular lightstones as soon
as experience from them becomes negligible.

The concordance/GLS deal is the big money-spinner. and worth much more
xp - experience from these is noticable for many more levels after the
xp from a regular lightstone stops moving your xp bar noticeably.
