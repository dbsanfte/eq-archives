Very cool, thanks for the screenies. I remember hearing some chatter at the 
end about Venekor, but didn't see him emerge on our server and I don't 
recognize any of the names present so it probably wasn't on the server I was 
playing at the end. :(

Have never seen Venekor in action. Wow, TRIPLE up arrow Group x4 red. 
Something to look forward to ...
