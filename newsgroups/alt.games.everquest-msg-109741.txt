Not only that, but since the client would have to respond to the server, it
would cake for Verant to detect unauthorized clients.  Unauthorized clients
means things like bots, etc., so they will NOT be happy about that.  All
Verant has to do one day is patch the UI to respond with a known string and
the next time any unauthorized clients logged on (assuming the patch didn't
break it) and their clients didn't respond properly, you can consider that
account (including the hours and hours of play time spent on it) dead in the
water.

Sign me up for that client...and let put all my best stuff in the bank on
one of its chars!
