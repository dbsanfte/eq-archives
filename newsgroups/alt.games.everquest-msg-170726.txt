Being liberal or conservative is, to me, a question of emphasis in
personal ethics/morals.  I prefer the terms left-wing and right-wing
when referring to politics, because they are political terms.  They've
fallen into disuse, except when abbreviated left or right, because at
one time or another both have been successfully associated with
extremism in the public eye by the opposing side (as the "conservative
movement" has been seeking to do with "liberal" in recent years, makes
me wonder what they will self-label themselves when the left succeeds
in returning the favor for "conservative" eventually).

Farrakhan is incidental to that description of radicalism, which I
suspect must be a paraphrase of something I read elsewhere.  Given
how much political stuff I read when I was younger I doubt it's an
original idea.

Yeah, get those damned conservatives out of the party!  We want only
lock-step reactionaries who know how to follow orders here!  I don't
see either party providing a home for a truly conservative person.
Partisan politics doesn't really leave much room for the principled
few who try to focus on retaining and building up the good in the
world.  Labels and authorship determine whether something is to be
supported or sabotaged, nevermind any question of actual merit.

They were pretty specific, and amazingly clever I think.  Between
prohibiting the government from establishing (or banning!) any
religion and guaranteeing freedom of speech and assembly they set
up amazingly solid protection for individual freedom of thought.

Condemning people for "wrong" thinking, whatever the words used.

No, I condemned the "conservative movement" for having economists and
(I think it was) social theorists who have opined publicly that "greed
is good".

See, now we wouldn't have this problem had we confined ourselves to
simple partisanship.  That way you don't need to think about what
you say, or why you say it.
