It *is* a game and it makes me cross to see people telling others they're
worthless because they're friend at level 60 in uber_guild_2001 told them
that the class was less than useful in situation x ;)

I've seen regular posts from Rangers on other servers who reportedly get
subjected to the most vitriolic and consistent verbal battery by fools
with nothing better to do ;)

It just contributes to people enjoying their hobby less when uninformed
repetition of second hand facts becomes par for the course, especially
when the repeated "wisdom" consists of "you're useless, and if you're not
you will be soon".

No offence to you though ;) Just one of those things that gets my goat....

Sui, proud doer of difficult things with "impossible" groups.
