Well he might be snoring but I'm not.  My ranger has crappy buffs too.  No one
asks for them.  Well, maybe one in 3000 people.  I'm amused when someone asks
for them - and since my ranger only uses mana for buffing / healing I don't
mind doing it.  My shaman on the other hand gets 3 personal tells an hour for
buffs - although going anonymous has helped a little.  THERE'S the difference
between good buffs and crappy buffs.
One last note and it has nothing to do with YOUR post:  A while back a true
newbie posted that one of the first things he learned to do was shout that he
wanted a sow.
Guess that covers the newbie / sow question...
