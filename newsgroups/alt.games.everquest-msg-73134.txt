Is there a site that lists currently broken quests?

I ask because I spent 3 days trying to get the last piece of one of my
quests and then come to find out, one of the NPC's is broken. Stopped me
dead in my tracks. I petitioned and I was told they were aware of the broken
quest but would not resolve it until after all SoL issues were resolved.

GRRREAAAATTT.

I guess it would've been nice to know this before I had spent the time on
the last piece and the previous ones as well.

BTW, the quest is the Ghoulbane quest. The NPC that was broken was Kanthuk
Ogrebane. He shows up as !Kanthuk Ogrebane and has the toon for a human
male. Hope that helps anyone currently working on this quest.
