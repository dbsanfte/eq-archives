Not sure what most of Brenlo's comments and this thread have to do with solo
LDoN's which is something I'd like to see also.  I logged on just this morning
at 4am after having problems sleeping.  Not one person /lfg in my group level. 
I wouldn't have minded being able to try a LDoN solo right about then.  Woulda
been a fun challenge.
