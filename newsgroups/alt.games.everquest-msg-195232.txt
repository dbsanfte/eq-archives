No they don't. They don't specify what version of Office you may have 
installed or what web browser you should use or what financial software 
may or may not install certain code libraries which might conflict. They 
give you minimum and recommended requirements, not a list of 
compatability ratings with other software and drivers.

Could have been better, to be sure. Outside the realm of acceptible? Nah, 
I don't think so.
