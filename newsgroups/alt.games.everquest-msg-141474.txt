Stop right there.  Repeat the following over and over until it has
become part of your very being (thousands of times, if necessary):
"In Everquest, Paladins are _not_ archers".
Paladin skill cap for Archery is 75, same as L14 skill cap.  Put away
your bow forever and go buy a Goranga Idol at the bazaar.  If you want
to be an archer, make a Ranger.  If you want to pretend to be an archer,
make a Warrior.  If you want to be a Paladin (in EQ), regard bows with
the same disinterest as robes.
