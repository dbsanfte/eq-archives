	I did batwing crunchies (batwings + frosting) til it maxed
	Then fishrolls (which i'm still doing at 130).

	You can get infinite batwings at several vendors (I'm using
	the one in the Bazaar) and frosting from any baking vendor.

	Fish is available from fishing or from some vendors in old-world
	cities.

	Not necessarily the cheapest, but fishrolls are long lasting food
