I'd have to disagree with that based on my experience with our server.

For a very long time, we had GM Grog as the lead GM for E'ci.  He was very
good at what he did, and had actually managed to get a reputation for fairness
and helpfulness, at least among the guilds that I know.

Now, instead of being sure we will get one specific GM that we know and trust,
we end up with Random GM_01, which probably has his own way of doing things,
his own ideas on how the game should work, etc, etc, etc.

In a service oriented business, having the customer familiar and friendly with
the representative that will be dealing with them is a huge advantage.
