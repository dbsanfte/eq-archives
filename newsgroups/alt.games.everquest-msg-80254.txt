While it may not be the nicest thing to do, there is a big difference.  When
I drop Grimfeather on a guard, it's a matter of my dying, or the guard
dying.  I usualy prefer to let the guard to that.  Also, I go out of my way
to not get his aggro, but that time he snuck up on me.

True, but the difference is, that there -are- in NK.  Why is running to a
guard less of a use of skill than running to a zone line?  Because the
guard's closer?  Then I guess my Overthere group shouldn't hunt on the lip,
we should move into the sarnak ruins, since that puts us too close to an
escape, and we're not relying on our skills.

I don't see why those are any less of a crutch than the guards.

What aspect for a challenge?  By the time you zone back in, it's either
gone, or has killed anyone you trained it on, and is waiting around.  When
it starts beating on you, it's a simple matter to zone again.  I fail to see
the added challenge.

That, in no way, suggests that people shouldn't use the guards when
appropraite.  Sure, they may not always help, but my ward undead won't work
against the vast majority of mobs in Norrath, but it's still a useful spell
against certain mobs.

I'd say knowing all available resources, and using them when needed is a
great strategy.

True, but that's not the point here.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
