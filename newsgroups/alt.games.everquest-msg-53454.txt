Everytime you camp and re log you move a little bit. If you camp out
near a wall and do it enough times you eventually will be teleported
to "safe spot". 

Can use it to your advantage, since the druid spell Succor always will
take you to safespot. Goto siren's grotto on cobalt scars side and
face the wall in corner and camp out. do it two or three times,
without moving when you relog and you will eventually be moved to the
WW side of siren's grotto.  Little safer than fighting.  Also an
exploit
