I haven't seen WOW yet, so i'll rely on the experience of the readers out
there for more information, but here is my impression.


Wow pluses.

Wow has a good quest sharing system.
Soling better than eq2 although eq2 might be closing the gap with recent
changes.
Wow minuses
No tradeskilling?
inferior graphics


EQ2

Voices add a lot of flavour and can crack me up. Also, i love that kerran
female voice. ;-)

Terrific visually although the graphics are if anything a little too
advanced for the current generation of video cards.

Lore is deep and continuity with eq1 is as far as i know, unique. Someone
once said "why roleplay in eq1 when you know halas (for example is going to
be destroyed". My answer is if you are roleplaying a roman soldier, you
ignore the fact that rome will fall and people will stereotype your race as
pizza producing cowards, in spite of a history of bloody conquest and
empire. You just try to be the best roman soldier you can be.

Tradeskilling better than eq1 but cumbersome, repitious, and strangely
lethal if you use a forge. I studied chemistry and the chem building had a
fire about once a year. Quite a few of my lecturers had facial scars from
where assorted items had exploded, and i almost had the fun of having a vial
of ether explode when a fellow student put a bunsen burner under her steam
distill only apparatus. I seriously doubt blacksmithing would be
substantially more dangerous than alchemy.


eq2 negatives

event horizons. You can be walking in a particular direction and suddenly
find you can't walk back. Black holes work that way. Reality might be nasty
with traps like that, but a game doesn't have to be. Why did they build them
into eq2? Did some dev belong to a secret cult of player haters? Sometimes
it reminds me of the way people play the sims, and get the characters to go
into the swimming pool. then remove the ladder, so they can't get out. EQ1
did that a few times (POG faction could never be improved, for example) but
there's a lot of it in eq2. I hope they fix the gnoll language quest.

tradeskilling can be terribly frustrating.

Some quests like the collection quests for butterflies seem to be impossible
for the level they are designed for. I've taken to buying up spotted yellows
and reselling them for a profit. Meanwhilst, other ones sell for a few
copper. (bought 2 for 50 sp, sold 1 gp and tonight others are selling for 3
gp) Why not make each butterfly appear in the same zone, with the same
probability? What's the advantage in denying people access to a level
appropriate collectable unless they are twinking an alt?


If anyone knows any wow negatives please add them as my ignorance of the
game may make this post unduly weighted against eq2, whears i suspect the
problems are endemic to MMOGS.
