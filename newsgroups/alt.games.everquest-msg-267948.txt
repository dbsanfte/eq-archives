You talk to a guy in Qwynos harbour, near the construction part on the
dock.  No trial, you just talk to him and choose.  LAter on, when you
specialise further, you talk to his wife.

As for societies, I joined a wholesale one in Baubbleshire (The
Deductive Directory) and a tradeskilling one is Starcrest (I forget
the name, but it's directly opposite the dock).

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
