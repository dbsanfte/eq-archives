2hp weapons use Piercing skill, so if you are working on Piercing then you
have no need to worry about 2hp.
I agree, I can't think of any 2hp weapons that have Ranger included as a

I would work H2H if you can, don't worry so much about Max'ing it (which
would be 100 I imagine) but it is helpful to have some skill in it to pummel
