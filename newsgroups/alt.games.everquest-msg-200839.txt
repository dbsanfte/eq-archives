Havent played a Druid much at all have you ? : )  The lack of the abilites
that I believe are being referred to are the entire strategies that Druids
use. As a rule, druids need large open areas where they can hunt. Snare is
of little value to a druid if the mob being snared is in such tight confines
as to still be able to get at the druid. Kiting requires room, and every
druid strategy that Ive seen requires some kiting. Whether your
root-n-rotting, Aggro kiting, Nuke Kiting, or Charm kiting, you need room to
position the mobs such that they cant get at you. THAT is the main reason
why I have had zero success hunting my druid in dungeons. Im more than happy
to give up Form of the Howler, SoE and other outdoor only spells, if I can
find a dungeon that gives me a the space that I need to do my job. As it is,
out of doors is the only place to do that.
