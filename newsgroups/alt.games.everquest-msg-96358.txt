Okey, for those who don't seem to be able to read between the lines, add 
the following:

'within reason.'

Happy now?

Anyway, it's not going to make much of a difference at higher levels... I 
mostly solo, and yet I can't remember the last unrezzed death that I ate 
since level 35 (actually, I do... it was in Stonebrunt, and there were no 
clerics in the zone). This will only make people have to wait less for a 
rez, and give lower-level people the chance of a partial xp rez too.
