It has a lot to do with the litigious nature of Americans.  Companies that
have been sued, put labels on things warning you against doing the most
stupid things possible in an effort to reduce the likelihood of being sued
by some complete idiot who does something that any rational person would
deem dangerous.  Other companies put the labels on to begin with to preempt
that possibility.  This way, when said idiot does something stupid, the
company has a defense in that the product had a warning label on it against
said stupid act.  There are some things about American society that I am
definitely less than proud of, the lack of personal accountability is high
on the list.
