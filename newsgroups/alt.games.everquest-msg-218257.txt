There was a company a couple years ago that had an interesting plan that
never went beyond demos, as far as I know, probably because it would have
(1) required the cooperation of many gaming companies, and (2) probably
didn't have widespread enough appeal to actually make money.

This plan was to get the gaming companies to agree to a common format for
character models (or at least allow importing models in this common format).
They were then going to have scanning stations in malls at game stores.
You'd go into a scanning station, and they would take a 3D scan of you, and
spit out a model on floppy or CD or something.  You'd take it home, and I
think you could edit it so that you could beef yourself up or whatever, and
then you could use than in online games.
