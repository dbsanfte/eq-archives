Kind of like what some free email services use to try to prevented automated
creation of accounts (because they don't want spammers to sign up for
hundreds of accounts to use as drop boxes)?

The clever spammers have found a workaround to that, which would also work
in the EQ case.  They simply set up porn sites, and offer free porn, but to
get to the free porn, you have to read a graphic on the screen and type it
in.  They couple this to their free email signup bot.  The bot gets the
graphic from the free email site, it gets displayed to a visitor to the porn
site, the porn visitor decodes it, and the bot completes the sign up, the
porn visitor gets his free entrance to the porn site.
