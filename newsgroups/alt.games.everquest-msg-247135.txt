IIRC the skill only works on non-magical weapons. Yes, I've seen it 
work, at high levels you can head to Sol A or Feerott and fairly 
reliably disarm the FS weapons the mobs carry around... not that there 
is much point to doing that.

Not much point pretty much sums up 'disarm'... like 'beg' theres a bit 
of taunt... that's about it.
