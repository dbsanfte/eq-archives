Never, from level one to 61, have I observed an AC buff doing anything noticable
for anyone I grouped with.  Really.  At low levels, the AC boost is extremely
tiny.  At higher levels, its larger but still is a small fraction of the players'
AC.  But thats not the real problem.

The problem is, AC matters only over a small range for each level mob.  If your AC
happens to fall in that range, then an AC boost will have some effect.  Not a huge
effect, but some.  But most people are either too low to get to that range even
with the boost, so it doesn't matter, or have higher AC than that range even
without the boost, so it doesn't matter.  Further, the people who are too low or
even "in the zone" usually aren't supposed to get hit, so it doesn't really matter
much what their mitigation is.  For a solo shaman or a ranger MA or well equipped
enchanter, more AC might actually matter.. but the AC boost off even the new 61 AC
boost is only 53 points, by then about 1/20th their AC total or they aren't in the
"interesting" zone.

An AC buff can do great things for a non twinked PL victim, but how many of those
do you see?  Most people being PLed have AC well up past the "this doesn't matter
anymore" zone, in fact thats probably why there is such a zone, to prevent 1000AC
level 10 warriors from walking thru content untouched.

If you want to talk spoiled, its probably because I'm used to having CHeal.  If I
had to sweat every HP point lost, I'd probably care more about marginal
improvements in mitigation.  I know at lower levels I vastly preferred monks, since
my HP boost meant more and I was using regular heals, so every point counted.  My
AC boost probably mattered more on them as well.  But really I only cast it on
people because its not much mana and made me look more useful.  My belief in it on
a practical basis has never been strong, at any level.

Bergh "who wants Ward?  How about Blessing of Pie?" Brelltender

ps: got my first 61 quest spell.  Ward of something or other.  53 point AC boost.
Can you hear me scream?
