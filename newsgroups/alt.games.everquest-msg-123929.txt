Various guides and such in sidebar

if interested in tradeskills.

A FAQ someone made is often posted in this newsgroup here also
alt.games.everquest


>What is needed as far as programs to start?  I see that there are alot of
>different games?

That 9.99 everquest box often in the discount section
of software stores now. Kunark, which includes everquest,
is a better start for the money since the lands of old EQ alone are 
a pretty poor intro though they are certainly better since they
upgraded some newbie areas/quests. Velious is great, but level 35 plus
for the most part so you can't really do anything there as a low
character.

Kunark (which includes old EQ) and luclin might be the way to go.
This is assuming you have 512 meg of ram and a 64 meg geforce or
something to enjoy Luclin with. Then you can play with the new models
and such from the start (new char models)


>Can I play more than one character with one account?

You can play up to 8 characters, but only one at a time (only one may
be logged 
on from an account at a time even if you have 2 computers, you'll need
another account/game software to run 2 at once on 2 computers)


>Are there any other games like Everquest out there?

Dark Ages of Camelot is similar as far as the fantasy, but its more
like a "what if" with our own earth's dark ages sort of. Though it is
more of a forward thinking mmorpg as far as risk/reward and
difficulty/downtime, and better in many other ways, it does not have
the staying power of EQ and many players reach max potential and are
then bored since all there is to do is Player Vs Player. These games
are just not very good with player vs player because they are so
level/skill/equipment based. For the most part you can't even loot
other players items, making it pointless to even bother fighting.
First person shooters like Quake III or half life do a far better job
of PVP.


>I used to play AD&D years ago and this looks similar.  Is it?

Text Muds always seemed closer to AD and D to me than EQ. EQ is based
partially on text muds in a way, but regressed in many ways. One text
mud I played was fairly fast paced with many mana and hp regenerating
tags on the better items. EQ, meanwhile, was out to give you more
downtime the HIGHER level you got instead of lowering it as in those
text muds.

EQ would be like AD and D if your GM played it in real time. This
would be an example.

<players> can we fight yet?
<GM> you are still regaining resources
<players> can we fight yet?
<GM> you are still travelling

<GM> (after 2 hours of real time have passed) all of your characters
get to the area and you can now fight, of course it is now past our
playing time so see you guys next week!

<players> = (

I remember a text mud I started playing while in college and probably
a couple years before ultima online, the first of the "graphical
muds", came out. I could play for four hours and accomplish quite a
lot. You could also run up to two characters and via follow and two
telnet sessions and a mud program could easily do so with a cleric
type and warrior type. Lately with EQ wearing on me a bit and nothing
else even remotely as good around I'm kind of waxing nostalgic for
that mud again... 

OOh this was the one I played:

http://www.apocmud.org/

It was not PVP, so similar to EQ in some ways. Its community 
was active with good zones being added pretty often and lots
of upgrads.


>Thanks-looking forward to joining a game soon

Best thing to do would be to watch a friend play and see the good and
the bad.
