Sure, just make a social that does /say blah followed by /doability x.
Of course, it'll clutter up the chat windows of anyone in the vicinity,
so if you want to be more friendly try ";tell <yourname> blah" instead
of /say blah.  Though that might actually make a round trip to the chat
server and back and thus add a delay on the timestamp.

Yes, we all agree that the message for a successful Intimidate, as well
as for a "resisted" one, includes a kick message.  What is unknown is
whether the Kick skill level is actually involved.  (The fact that Kick
itself never skills up when using Intimidate makes me think it's not.)

Sounds like what is necessary is a three-step experiment:

(1) Go find a source of mobs with a fairly narrow level range (e.g., all
level 1) that won't agro on you.  Mash intimidate against them to get a
good size sample of the results.  Possible results, assuming you stay in
range and facing them, should include "not scaring anyone", "kick missed",
"kick for damage / resisted fear", "kick for damage / very afraid".  Best
would be to do all this when your Intimidate skill is maxed, so it won't
change during the experiment.

(2) Go fight a whole bunch of blues using nothing but Kick, to raise
your Kick skill several notches (e.g. from ~40 to ~100).

(3) Repeat step 1 and see if the percentages change much.  If you gained
one or more levels in step 2, get yourself killed to unding so you won't
increase Intimidate during step 3.  (Be sure to hurry with step 3 so your
rez timer(s) don't expire.)

Note: I'm NOT volunteering to try this experiment.  I've got enough time-
sinks on my plate just killing trash mobs for faction with my Iksar. :-)
Not to mention I did my bit for science jumping down elevator shafts to
measure sitting regen after they patched it. :-)

Yup, as with most skills (melee or trade), you can get better even when
you fail.  The general wisdom is that it's more likely on a success, though.

Hm, maybe the other 3 seconds are for the animation, and the extra regen
doesn't actually start until after those 3 seconds?

Then again, I just checked my own logs (I've taken to always saving them;
makes it easier to check things like this!), and I see some cases where
the start/end are exactly 1 minute apart, and others where it's as much
as 1:06 later.

I suspect what it is is that the ability starts immediately, and lasts
for some number of ticks (might be 11 instead of 10), and then "falters"
immediately after the last bonus regen, or perhaps just before the first
regen where the counter is going to zero.  So the interval between the
messages will depend on whether you start it just before or just after
a tick, or somewhere in between.

/boggle?  Are you sure you had a 2HS and not two 1HS's?

Yup, it always shows it twice.  Just an oddity of however they
implemented it, I suppose.

Yeah, I hate chasing down greenies when they run.  Of course, I can
sometimes use "monk snare", i.e., feign death to get the mob to stop
running.

I'm not sure how much the duration varies.  But if, as you noted
earlier (though snipped in this reply), if mobs swing every 3 seconds,
that's still 7-8 swings you're avoiding, not to mention no blocks or
ripostes.

LOL.  Yeah, sometimes I have to wonder about the loot on some mobs.
Like when I find a bat with three wings. :-)
