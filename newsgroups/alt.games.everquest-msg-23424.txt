Well, except Fansy didn't care if he died, so that would only have
interrupted him for a short while, not stopped him.  He died many times
doing the SG trains, just about every time he took a screenshot, he died.
Mind you, I don't have a problem with what he was doing, It is after all a
server without rules, where training is definitely permitted.  They are
fixing it so that this type of thing won't happen for long in the future by
allowing the players to more easily take care of the problem, which,
although it most severely penalizes the good team, I also don't have a
problem with.
