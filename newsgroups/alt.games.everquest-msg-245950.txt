Sorry I totally disagree with this.  Ive only been playing a couple of
months but have a 57 cleric on Stromm and I have found that there are
WAY to many people in thier 50's that shouldnt be there.  They have no
idea how to play thier class, I suspect its because almost all thier
groups have been ldon's.   These are fairly easy and do not give
people the necessary skills to go out into the real world.

Now dont get me wrong, I also have a hard time finding groups.  This
is not because I am a bad cleric, I actually get a lot of compliments
on my skills.  I dont know the reason yet but suspect its because I
havent been playing long and people just dont know my toon yet.
