Um... OK... when I say 'something big has gone wrong' I mean serious 
router failure 'out on the internet'. I've got a fiber drop into the 
building I live and my connection is very reliable.

I most certainly did not mean an in game occurance like a wipeout or three.

That appears rude, but not inconceivably so. I've managed to be unable 
to correctly remember the spelling of the peoples names I've been 
grouped with after logging out for 5 minutes. With no logs or windows to 
scroll back, and so many people anonymous, it can be hard to find 
people. Did you send word to him??

Like I said I rarely go LD. But I'm not about to hold legitimate spotty 
internet issues against someone... lots of people I know will have a 
'bad week or two' with there connection, or with some new driver they 
put in...

I just wanted to clarify that I'd be extra diligent/patient before 
concluding that the LDs are deliberate.
