    Self spell haste? Did you not recruit even a single enchanter to your
guild? Why in god's name does self spell haste mean ANYTHING in a DPS
comparison?

    Weaponry: Skybreaker, 13/19 1HB with 75 point proc, The Va'Dyn. Good old
Scepter of Mastery, 13/21 1HB. Both simple to get for a guild at the level
of your guild (you DID beat Gozzrem, after all). You have a 50/43 2HB if you
have the Gozzrem shovel. Dennis has a 13/21 and 14/24 1HS, and MAYBE has a
12/19 with DD proc. For a 2HS he MIGHT have a 50/44. You are on a better
damage table than Dennis. So how the hell are you not beating his DPS, with
better weaponry and better attack tables?
