We're talking situations where it buys the healers the crucial 1-2 seconds
they need *just to land a heal*.  Period.  Maybe it didn't make the
difference, maybe it did...when I came within 5% of dropping, I'm just
glad I used everything I could to survive it.  A high DPS weapon ain't
doing me good if I'm dead because they couldn't get a CH in time.  And
don't say "well, if they are that tough, get someone else to tank or do
'em"...cuz you know that isn't good enough for me. :)

I dunno, if my advice is crap, then it's crap...but I'm the last person
who needs a lecture about the theory of "if they die fast you don't need
good defense".  The way some of you folks talk you'd think a ranger never
learned how to hold her weapon, sheesh.  (OMGZ, DPS aer teh win? OMGZ
LOLZ!!11!!)

Fair enough. :) But the ones I was address probalby do not have a 41/31
2hb.  And by the same argument you pose, no one should ever use a
windblade over a WMBS.
