OMG  .. I know exactly what you are talking about.  What I am starting to
hate is all the people that are starting to take; SOW's, Heals, and Ports
for granted!!!  I swear like every other person that is walking by me will
ask me for one of these things!!  I hate the fact that I have to be anon all
the time just so I won't get spammed with beggers which makes it hard for MY
friends to find out where I am. I really don't mind passing out a heal or
Sow if it seems that they need it... and i dont mind giving it when ppl ask
because of a CR... but come on people you can get by without it...I did with
my rogue...

Just like the other day.. I saw 2 lower lvl char's that were really low on
health so I stood around and healed them and sow'd them just in case they
needed to run(which I will do anytime I see someone in trouble)  but then
when they killed it.. they never said thanks... then they pulled others and
kept asking me for heals and buffs.. I mean come on I'm not your freakin'
groupie... if I wanted to power lvl you I will offer my time...

That is what irritates.. ppl think you have nothing better to do than sit
around healing them for fun... I really don't mind every once in a while...
but not when it is not needed or thankful...
