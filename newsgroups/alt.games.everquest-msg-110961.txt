I strongly suspect in the majority of cases it is the latter, now I actually
get a bit of plat to spend and keep my auction open all the time, but I only
deal with the people who can name a price. I haven't actually sold anything
myself, things I can no longer use I just hand down or give away. The thing
I love to see is someone who includes the price in their initial auction,
and I always tip them generously if I purchase the item of them, stating
exactly why I am paying the extra (to encourage them to continue doing so).
