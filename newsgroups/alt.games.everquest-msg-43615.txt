Doesn't sound true though?  I mean, no matter WHAT the subject would have
been they're probably damned tired of listening to whining.

Sour grapes?  Come on, I'd have to really give a shit and I don't.  All my
lowbies characters are twinks...TLC on or off doesn't affect me in the
slightest.  What bothers me are fucking farmers camping shit that is
seriously green where people who CAN get xp from killing it are SOL.  But, I

you pay $9.89/mo you're entitled to fuck someone's day over. *shrug*
