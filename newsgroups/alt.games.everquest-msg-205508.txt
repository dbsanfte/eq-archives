    Shadow Haven, the pond in the shorty area near the pottery wheel.
There's no mobs in the water or out of the water that will attack you, there
are corners you can lodge yourself in if unattended swimming interests you,
there's even a "water slide" you can swim up and down for extra fun. And
once you're done swimming, you can buy fishing gear from the vendor closest
to the water and raise fishing. I used to always keep one alt near that pond
to raise swimming if I had to log over from a raid wipeout, but with the new
bank swap slots I keep them parked next to bankers now.
