The harvesting tools are part of an aborted project. They were intended to 
provide bonuses for harvesting but in the end they decided against them, so 
they should be coming out of the release. You can harvest resources now 
without using any tools and you will see that when you initiate the harvest, 
the appropriate animation occurs, as though you actually had the tool in 
your hand (i.e., you'll chop wood with an axe, or mine a rock with a pick, 
etc.)

These titles are attained after a certain number of kills vs. a particular 
mob type. You'll notice people running around with the title "Winterfury, 
Slayer of Fairies", that's what that's about. Look in your Persona window, 
there's a drop-down there for both prefix and suffix. The titles will show 
up in your suffix drop down as you earn them.

There once was the notion of Masteries. These were quests that you could 
complete by first buying a book from a sage in the Mage's Tower in South 
Qeynos. As you killed various mobs you could collect pieces of their anatomy 
and Examine them to add them to your collection. When you completed a 
particular collection, your reward was to be granted a spell or combat art 
that was uniquely powerful vs. that mob type. So, when I completed my 
Skeleton Mastery quest, I received Skeleton Mastery Smite, a version of my 
Priest Smite spell that did more than double usual damage vs. Skeletons. 
They took out these books and quests and turned them into the racial 
traditions that were introduced as part of the recent individualization 
revamp. Now, when you reach certain levels you get to choose between various 
"traditions". This is where the tradeskill bonuses emerge and also where you 
get to choose what kind of mob Mastery you prefer. I liked the old method 
better, it was much more of an accomplishment completing the quest than 
simply hitting a level lol.
