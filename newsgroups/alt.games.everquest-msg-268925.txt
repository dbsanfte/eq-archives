Boy still don't get it do you? Inane = Complacently or inanely foolish. So?
Nothing I said was foolish. Is it possible you're reading into what I said?
I simply stated that I didn't want to be confused with a homophobic
individual since I've seen many in my years following usenet. For pointing
that out beforehand you believe I'm inane. And *I* believe you've
intentionally read meaning into my statement. Please re-read the thread and
show me where I was being facetious. As a matter of fact your statements
above are categorized as "stupid". Here, I'll quote you again: "There, I've
given you several other stupid comments to make." There is absolutely
nothing wrong with my vocabulary or reading comprehension. But,
unfortunately, you've shown your comprehension to be lacking. And you're
right. *Your* conversation is inane (or fatuous or vacuous if you prefer?).
Have a nice day!
