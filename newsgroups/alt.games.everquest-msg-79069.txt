After much waffling I have decided on an ogre shadowknight for my
first serious alt. Should be a pleasant change from a playing a
halfling druid.

I have yet to decide on where to hunt. As a druid I hunted mostly in
MT, NRo, Oasis, SK, LOIO, IC, DL and CS. I would like to try hunting
elsewhere rather than in zones I know inside out.

Any thoughts? I'm tempted to try dungeons since I tended to avoid them
as a druid. Or is my size going to be a problem? Another possibility
is Luclin (Paludal looks interesting, for instance).
