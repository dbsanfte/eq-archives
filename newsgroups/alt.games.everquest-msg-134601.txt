I know this probably sounds crazy, and if it doesn't its
probably been proposed a dozen times before, but
why should the patch server also be the login server?

If there was a server we could go to to download patches,
then the login server wouldn't be so congested that
people who have already patched successfully can't
log in.

OK, well that doesnt' sound all that important, you
say, after all, everyone who gets the patch then
logs in, anyway, so the congestion for those who
haven't got their patch yet stays the same.

Aha, but then you can go to alternate means of
getting the patches.. like FTPing them off of your
guild site.

Come to think of it, what stops us doing this now?
I see another post coming.
