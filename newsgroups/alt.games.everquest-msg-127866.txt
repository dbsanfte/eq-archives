Yes, I can imagine such a game.  I can not only imagine how much I would
enjoy it, but also how much lame gimpy ass leet boys would hate it and
that makes it sound all the sweeter to me.  Just think, a world where
folks actually developed a system of common landmarks to communicate,
where they actually learned to navigate the world rather than a
coordinate system, where those unable to succeed in such a world would
wither and die in the wastes while those who could manage would thrive. 
Why it would almost be like playing a roleplaying game.
