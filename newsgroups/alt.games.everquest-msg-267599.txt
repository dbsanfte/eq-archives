It's simply not necessary.

EQ1 posts have dropped to a whisper of their former selves, and it's
just not *that* hard skip the EQ2 posts.  This particular saying
applies very well here:  You're making mountains out of mole hills.

If an EQ2 newsgroup is created, you'll probably see lots of EQ2 posts
anyway, either from newbies who don't know about the EQ2 newsgroup
(they'll just search their newsgroup list for "everquest" and
subscribe on the first hit), and you'll probably also see lots of EQ2
stuff crossposted to the EQ1 newsgroup.

In the end, you'll *still* have to skip EQ2 posts in your precious EQ1
newsgroup, and you'll *also* have to skip the flame fests that'll
result.  bizbee will be so busy flaming "off topic posts" that he'll
have to setup macros to insult people or suffer carpal tunnel
syndrome.

Besides, in 6 months, you'll have switched to EQ2 anyway, and you know
it.  ;)
