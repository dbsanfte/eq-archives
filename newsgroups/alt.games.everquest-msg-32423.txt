The first time I went really deep into Kedge it was with a bunch of
guildmates.  We were going to kill Phinny so a paladin could pick up
that finger bone that spawns on the ground in his room.

Total Party Wipeout.

So we're all standing on the shore near the Unrest entrance, and nobody's
looking like they're doing anyhing.  I get impatient, head into Kedge, 
cast Illusion: Water Elemental on myself (intrinsic EB), invis up, and go
off to get my corpse.

There I was, naked, deep in Kedge Keep.  I was conning everything, but
nothing saw invis.  I made it to the entrance to Phinny's room.  There's my
corpse!  Heart pounding, I pull it back to zone.

Still no noises about anyone doing anything CR-wise.  So I go back.  First
corpse I see, I send the guy a tell asking for consent.  I drag it back.

Repeat 7 or 8 more times.

I still count that as the scariest thing I've ever done in this game.

The funny thing is that the next day, the paladin and I went back, by
ourselves, and got the bone.  Phinny was up, but by hugging wall of the
room, we were able to avoid aggroing him.  Except that the pally swam into
the middle of the room and aggroed Phinny, so I had to drag his corpse back
out with me.
