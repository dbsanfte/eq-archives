Money will come with levels, especially after 50.  I can remember when I was
a little druid and someone gave me a beer stained coldain tunic.  I sold
that puppy for 300pp and thought I was rich, considering 50pp was about all
I'd ever had at one time.  Now, I can barely drag myself to the auction zone
to sell anything less than 1k.  Just keep levelling and remember that the
people who have all the nice stuff in low levels earned it with high level
alts.
