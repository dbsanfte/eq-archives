[snip level 30 vs level 40 drink regen for level 31 character]

It's very easy to test - get level 30 drink, use up power, drink the
drink, then hover the mouse pointer over the power bar.  You'll see it
increasing every few seconds, always by the same amount.  That's your
regen per tick.  Now repeat with a level 40 drink, and see if the
regen per tick is higher.
