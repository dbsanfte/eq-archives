I have been using showeq for over a year now and have had no problems
with being caught.  People need to be realistic about this.  Seq is
undetectable.  Period.  Someone brought up a point of a GM spawning an
invisible Ancient Cyclops... Well sure it's technically possible that
they could catch someone using seq but seriously do GMs have this much
time and/or the desire to follow through with such a process?  Now
about the EULA infringement.  If someone was caught I doubt they would
go so far as to argue in court how the EULA is invalid.  We're talking
about a video game here.  Video game.  Video.  Game.

Here are some quotes from various idiots...
"Breaking the information down and translating it to the user, in my
opinion, is manipulating the information."
There is a difference between reading and writing data - sniffing
packets is not writing data.

"I have recently had the 'pleasure' of helping a friend camp ragefire.
 We sit there for days waiting for him and the uber guild using showEQ
(or something similar) zones in with a raid force about 3 seconds
*before* he pops."  As of a few months ago mobs are on random timers. 
Seq does not have the ability to predict the exact time that ragefire
will spawn.  What seq does have is the ability to detect if ragefire
exists in the zone.
