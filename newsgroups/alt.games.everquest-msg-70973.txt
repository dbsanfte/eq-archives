Beastmasters are a warrior or monk / shaman hybrid.  Warriors can use fungi,
monks can use fungi, shamans can use fungi.  Cats can wear leather, chain,
and plate, but cannot be "casters."  Fungi can be worn by leather-wearers,
chain-wearers, or plate-wearers, but not by "casters."  Perhaps it's a
meaningless statement to you, or perhaps you're just being purposefully
obtuse.  I believe the latter.

Something *was* changed; that is not even possible to dispute.

It was done with a "nerfing" intention, though arguing the semantics of
whether it's a nerf since nobody ever got to use it the previous way is
purely that, arguing semantics.
