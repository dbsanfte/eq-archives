Just got my staff of temperate flux (bout time im 44), and I'm loving it.
It doesn't have a large effect (-6heat,cold when cast on myself) but it just
seems so cool to click it and have it go off with no delay.  Can anyone tell
me any other items I might want to get that are insta-cast?  Are there any
that actually do damage?(even small damage is fine)  My character is a gnome
wizard of 44th level.
