Well, that sounds to me like it could be one of two things... Either 
dodgy drivers (Windows endorsement is probably not worth the paper it's 
printed on) or heat. Before you do anything too radical, try downloading 
and installing the latest Detonator drivers from nvidia.com, and see if 
that helps. If it does not, I would perhaps try (not as a permanent 
solution, just as a test) to play for a while with the case open and a 
big fan blowing air at the card, or perhaps just cranking the air 
conditioning up a bit.

If it turns out that the problem is heat-related, and the temperature in 
the room where you play is no higher than reasonable, perhaps the fan on 
the card is faulty. That card runs very hot, and EQ is probably one of 
the games that drives it hardest.
