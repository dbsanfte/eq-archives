STR...
Improves ATK rating (but not by much)
Increases weight allowance
Improves rate at which you learn melee attack skills (piercing, 1Hslash)
Increases damage

AGL...
Improves AC rating (again, not by much)
Increases rate at which you learn melee defense skills (dodge, parry, evade)

DEX...
Increases rate at which you learn Rogue skills (Backstab, Pick Pocket)
Improves chances of succeeding with Rogue skills
Increase rate at which you learn ranged weapon skill (archery, thrown)
Increases rate at which weapons proc
Increases chance of range weapons hitting

(so out of your choices, I'd say that "DEX, AGL then STR" was the better
advice)

From what I've read in other posts, and my own limited experience of
Rogues... just getting AGL and STR to 100 is enough for those two stats, and
max DEX as far as you can
