Heh. There are two weird little underground mazes in Cabilis, one in East 
and one in West.  It sounds like you're describing the East Cabilis one.  
You're right that there is no way up into it out of the water (as far as 
I've managed to find... :) ) But, there's an entrance into it from the top 
inside the shaman/SK guild.  in the main room there are big glowing red 
panels that port you upstairs to the SK guild, then you go down a series 
of ladders in one tower, and wander around until you find a room with a 
broken bridge over a pit.  This drops you down into the maze.  The 
underwater barracuda passages are the (well, a, there's at least two) way 
out, not in. :)  This maze also has a mob in it for the enchanter epic, 
Vessel Drozlin.  There's a pit you have to levitate over to get to him.
There are some halfassed maps of this area at www.eqmaps.com.

In West cabilis, by the arena, there is an alcove near the water, where 
the necro spell vendors used to be... They moved them because nobody could 
find that area. :)  It's possible to get up into a small mazey area in 
there (by swimming, as I recall) but I didn't find anything particularly 
interesting in there, just an obscure guild trainer and a couple wandering 
skeletons.  I haven't found any particularly useful maps of this area, 
although it may be on the LoY map, can't remember for sure.
