Setting:  A cartoon land of mesas and canyons.

Wile E. Coyote is chasing his arch-nemesis over
trails and around hairpin turns.

In his frantic haste to capture the Roadrunner,
Wile E.  doesn't realize they've run out over
open air until the Roadrunner stops and points
down.

Wile E. holds up a sign that says:

"I wouldn't mind so much......"

[Flips sign]

"But I hate it when he defies the law of gravity."

[Falls]

Roadrunner holds up a sign:

"I never studied law!"

Meep, MEEP!
