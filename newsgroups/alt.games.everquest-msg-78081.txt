Does anyone out there have any problems with their Hercules 64 Mb Kyro II 3D
prophet 4500 graphics card?

I've recently installed one and it doesn't work when I load EQ. It lets me
connect and select a server and then goes all crappy and locks my PC up. I'v
egot the newest drivers for it, reloaded DirectX 8.1 and even formatted my
HDD and reloaded windows ME, all to no avail.

Any help would be much appreciated.
