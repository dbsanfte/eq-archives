It's gotta be something that can tank and hold aggro somewhat decently 
(rogues have evade, so it's not a huge issue, but it only comes up every 10 
seconds or something).  Healing is also a big bonus.  Slowing another big 
bonus.  I'd probably go with a bst or maybe a ranger.  Once you're in your 
30s or so, I'm not sure anything will really be an effective partner for a 
rogue.
