Funny thing about this, until you are very high level you'll rarely see anyone
using anything they loot themselves.

Go in and kill a mob, it drops an item you could use.  Oh joy!  Now to
level, though, you need to kill that mob another 50 times, and that means
you end up with another 10 of that item.  If you sell all 10 of them, you
can buy something much better than what you are looting.

Fine Steel weapons are really great when you are very low level, but
very low level people either A) don't have much money or B) have
a lot of money given to them by a higher level character.  If A) they
can't pay more than a vendor would, if B) they want a better weapon.

Weapons are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenum; while you
have quite a few armor slots to cover on your person, you'll only be
using one weapon at a time for a while, so its the easiest and most
important upgrade at low levels.

It is a good idea to avoid buying from or selling to vendors if you can,
but this rule generally applies to armor with stats or weapons that
at least are "magic" in some way.  You could -try- moving your bronze
armor by going to areas frequented by people who can't quite loot
it yet but who might have more money than a vendor would pay, say
Crushbone (lots of CB Belt rich people there) or Butcherblock (lots
of bone chip rich people there)
