Not once in 58 levels has my magician noticed *any* aggro as a result of
damage shielding engaged fighters.  Not even off group damage shield when I
was at under 2 bubbles of health, always a good time to see how much a spell
*really* aggros.  Perhaps druid DS is different.

I do get faction hits as a result of casting it during a fight.  So maybe it
adds like "1" aggro or something.  :)
