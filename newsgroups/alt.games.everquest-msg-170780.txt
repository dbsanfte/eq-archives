I'm sorry, let me try to put that a little more clearly.  You evidently
misunderstand me.  You're implying that I said "If your child isn't given a
condom he/she will come home pregnant or diseased."  I'm saying that if your
child does not have access to protection and if they have sex anyway they
stand a good chance of coming home one day and telling you they either will
soon be a parent or have some disease that might kill them and will
certainly be highly unpleasant and expensive, not to mention unhealthy.

Are you aware of the number of high school students who have unprotected sex
not because they don't have the money for a condom (come on, condoms only
cost a few bucks), but because they (1) are embarrassed to go to a store and
ask for them, (2) don't know that "the local 7-11 sells condoms", and/or (3)
don't want to go get them in the heat of the moment?

The "major institution" your son goes to is not endorsing them having sex
but is simply telling them that if they do, they should use a condom and is
providing them with condoms so that they will run less risk of being hurt.
It's a lot easier for a kid to use a condom if he gets it without the
embarrassment of asking for it (all their friends are getting them too so
they might as well take them), without having to find out where they're at,
and has them on his/her person in "the heat of the moment" so that there's
virtually no inconvenience.  By "inconvenience" I don't mean it would be
inconvenient for them to have sex -- it wouldn't -- but that it would be
inconvenient for them to have *unprotected* sex.

As for your "question", well, I'm sure your son now knows all about the
failure rate of condoms, since surely as a parent you've told him all about
it.  That being said, and since you've surely also told him that he can get
condoms at the corner store (since you wouldn't want him to have unprotected
sex just because he doesn't know where to find them), he has the knowledge
to protect himself and to make an informed decision regarding whether he
will have sex, knowing the risks.  Since he knows all these things, how can
you think that recieving a condom at school will make him any more or less
likely to have sex?  Surely, if you've properly impressed upon him the risks
of unprotected sex (which are far higher than those of protected sex, even
given the failure rate), he'll be able to overcome the embarrassment of
going to the corner store to get condoms, in which case he would get them
anyway, and receiving them at school will make things no easier for him.

On the other hand, if you *haven't* told him all these things then for the
reasons I listed above he is far more likely to have unprotected sex if he
does "sleep around" as you so crudely and ignorantly put it (it is crude and
ignorant to simply make the assumption that if your son has sex, he will be
"sleeping around" and not making love to a person he truly cares about, or,
worse, to make the assumption that the latter case also counts as "sleeping
around".  I might even be too disgusted to continue this discussion if I
thought you held the eminently obtuse latter view, so I'll assume yours is
the former).

What it really comes down to, I think, and what I don't think you want to
hear, is that you believe that any risks, including your son's health,
future, and possibly his life, are acceptable to take in order to try to
prevent your son from taking what you consider "immoral" action.  Because
that's really what bothers you, isn't it?  You make a brief gesture in the
direction of implying you're concerned because of the risks, but what you
said and really mean is that you think that for him to have sex would be
"immoral behavior".  You are so willing to force your own morals on him that
you will sacrifice him just so that you won't have to think that, God
forbid, your son was immoral.

Think about it.
