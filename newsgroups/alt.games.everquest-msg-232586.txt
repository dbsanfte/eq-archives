1. Does anyone know of any 1h or 2h bashing weapons with particle effects
that a DE Necromancer or High Elf Magician would be able to use and can be
attained by someone around lvl 50? (I already know about Smoldering Brands,
btw - I'm looking for something more high end) Doesn't matter if its
droppable or not.

2. I saw someone holding what looked like a frozen torch (that's the best
way I can describe it) in the PoK bank once. The person was wearing armor,
so it wasn't an Int caster. Any idea what it may have been? (It wasn't a
Ceramic Rod of Storms or a Wand of Ice Storms - It definitely looked like a
bluish torch, made out of ice or crystal)

3. I saw at Electronics Boutique's website that the boxed version of the
Gates of Discord expansion is going to come with a keychain resembling a
staff weapon and the staff will be an actual item that anyone who buys the
boxed version of the expansion will be able to obtain. I know the expansion
isn't supposed to be out until early Feb, but have there been any pics that
show what the actual staff looks like in-game, or any rumors about what the
stats on the staff might be?
