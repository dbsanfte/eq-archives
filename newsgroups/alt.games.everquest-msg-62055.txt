Yep, and if kos you better start killing some dragons... a lot.

NPCs you can kill to raise the faction: 

Esorpa of the Ring 
Faydedar 
Gorenaire 
Phara Dar 
Talendor 
Xygoz

Something you might try as a hobby is find out when guilds are doing
those dragons if you are not. Wait until its obvious they are not
going to have a wipeout ( so you don't die nex) run by and shoot one
arrow or cast one spell on the dragon. Even if you do no damage or the
spell is ressed you still get faction when the dragon dies.

You might want to ask the guild first, but that may just irritate them
while they are busy with the dragon. if you run by and cast you can
then say "oops" even though its unlikely anyone would notice. Then run
off away from them and wait for the faction plus.

I just finished my epic with fayd.. and I don't THINK the druid
spawned fayd gives a plus to venril.. can't remember for sure.

If you are JUST kos, try a change form spell.. like having someone
cast group wolf form. If you are non kos in group wolf form, then
collect many sarnak braids (a ton, too bad they don't stack) and turn
them in that way until you are no longer kos when not in wolf form
either. I can't remember if wolf raises faction in kunark though.. I
know at least in firiona vie zone it LOWERS it so overthere might be
the same.

In case you are wondering, no invis won't work.. you become vis when
turning in the item then BAP dead.
