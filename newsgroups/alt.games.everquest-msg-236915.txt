In most cases religion is about the deity, not about the worshiper.
The deity does not have a "need" to respond, you are suppose to work
on Faith, which is the basic foundation of religion.

Not to mention an issue with the bastid poking you in the eye with a
stick.

I think the logic he was going on was... If you have made up your mind
(i.e. choose to NOT belive in a deity), there really is nothing anyone
else can do to convince you otherwise.   But you give allowance to
belive in a god that poked you in an eye rather than belive you are
losing your mind or that somone slipped you a mikkie (i.e. date rape
drug).


Organized religion has one purpose, To gather more money to gather
more people to gather more money...   sorta like a mobius strip..
where time becomes a loop.
