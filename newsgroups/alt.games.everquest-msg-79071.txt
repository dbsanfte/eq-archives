I'm hijacking this thread, and following up my own post.  Just wanted to 
say that I also am now epic equipped!  Woot, nifty little blue notes 
following me around, and 16/26 is a damn nice ratio for an off-hand 
weapon.
On Saturday I needed guts from Nez, Eldrig, and Trak, plus a phinny spine 
MQ and the metal bits.  On my way to VP I saw Nez on tracking, told 
guildies he was up, and pulled him to Skyfire zone where we got him to 30% 
when he gated and brought me with him.  I had nothing to lose, so I just 
kept fearing him and meleeing all I could, while waiting for my group to 
track to me.  Bard fear being AE means that I had a bunch of adds running 
away and coming back every 30 seconds or so.  I killed him with less than 
30hp left.
Went to VP, killed some wurms, couldn't kill a dragon with 18, so decided 
to do a quick run to 3rd island in Sky for a necro epic turnin.  On the 
way back to Skyfire another guild bard told me he saw Eldrig die, and was 
camping his PH for me.  I found a port to Skyfire, relieved him, and 
Eldrig spawned immediately.  I couldn't solo him, but my guild quickly 
headed to OT zone, where I barely made it out, quick BP heal, and back in 
to kill him.
Went to Sky, did necro bits, then ran from Freeport to WK and SK to do 
turn-in bits.  Ported up to Nexes and down to GFay to do more turn-ins in 
Steamfont.  Did the MQ with a guildie on Monday (we both sneak on to do 
quest turn-ins at work, bad bad people).  Tuesday as soon as the patch was 
cancelled I got email telling me to be ready to do undead bard at 7:30.  
Got home, cooked, logged on at 7:15, hit Seb at 7:30, by 8:15 Trak was 
dead, and by 8:30 I had my epic.  Went out drinking with my guildleader, 
woot!

Arolpin
damn happy bard, investigating rogue epic now
