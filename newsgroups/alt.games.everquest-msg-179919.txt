I have a hot key for Sense Heading and any time that I'm walking or sitting
and medding, I'm constantly using my Sense Heading skill to get the points up.
If you're a Magician, you're probably spending time sitting around waiting for
your mana to regenerate.  Use that time to up your Sense Heading skill, and it
might help you out.
