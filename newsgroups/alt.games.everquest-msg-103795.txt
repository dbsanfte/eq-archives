Hmmm, after thinking about it like an enchanter, I was excited to see a
weapon obviously meant for my lowly pet.
EQ finally decided to put a weapon in game to balance the total lack of
worth of Goner. (long may he rest in peace)
But then I got to thinking again (I know, a dangerous trick not to be tried
alone or without a net) and decided that
with EQ logic NONE   NONE meant that my pet couldn't use it since officially
he is an NPC. But then logic kicked
in and told me that, if it were unusable by an NPC then the mob that dropped
it couldn't use it either. So why would
an NPC that couldn't use an item be carrying it around? Only one reason
comes to mind: VERANT IS TWINKING!!!
They are using mobs to hold items until their other newby mobs can spawn and
claim the items. Then they are using the
holder mobs to transfer uber gear to the newbie mob! It's brilliant! Think
of the possibilities!!! The next time you run by
on the way to FP and decide to whack that orc just to hear him die, you had
better hope you don't whiff the attack! If
it gets a shot at you, it MAY not be with a rusty sword!

Then again, I just MAY have had too long a night playing last night and am
getting delusional! Hmmmm!
