I'm sorry if it offends you that as a lvl 13 enchanter I still need guards
occasionally. My other characters do not. They're perfectly capable of
taking care of themselves. I NEED them when I'm killing (or trying to) one
kodiak and another 2 come along out of the blue, kill my pet and drain all
my health. Excuse me, but -- is that really a problem for you??

I apologized to him for the language. That make you feel any better?
