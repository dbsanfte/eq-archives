Which

A bard sucks for melee, so STR isn't needed.  DEX is for procs, and since
bards suck at melee I wouldn't bother.  AC is always nice, but not that
necessary at level 29.  Haste is, of course, kinda nice...but if it costs
too much mana, just tell him to sing his song. :)

At 29 you'll be doing yourself a lot better to let off on most buffs and
start DoTing instead in that duo.
