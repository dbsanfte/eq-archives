First, ask how loot is being done when you join the group.  If it's
"friendly" (which is what you're describing) then suggest alpha
looting (where people loot in alphabetical order) and say you'll
even keep track of it.   If they still want to "friendly" loot, you'll
either have to make sure you're right there when some mobs
die or leave the group.

Other than that, it's either solo or live with it.
