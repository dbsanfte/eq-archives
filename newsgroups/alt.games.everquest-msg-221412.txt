It's not quite as bad as that anymore.  The L44 LoY Druid spell is a
428hp heal.  I can tell you from personal experience that while it's
still kinda light it's a whole lot better than GHeal.  That doesn't
help much in the mid-50s of course, but it is quite handy before that.

I've run into a number of Rangers who were so sure that they couldn't
tank that they "didn't bother" to gear up for tanking, thus turning
"Rangers can't tank" into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
