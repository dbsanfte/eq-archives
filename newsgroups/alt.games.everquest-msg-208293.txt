If that were that true, then you would not want to use a geerlock, as 
that raises your effective skill level by 5%, yet, I can state with 
absolute certainty that you can skill up until your raw skill level is at 
the trivial level of an item, regardless of your effective skill level.  
And in fact, I highly recommend using a skill enahncer if it does not 
drop your controlling stat, as you will get more successes.  I have not 
ever tested this IA theory, but, it is definitely the first time I have 
heard it mentioned, both regarding skillups, and success rates on 
combines.  In fact, the effect of IA is to raise your effective level 
when casting spells by 3, which would have zero effect on tradeskills, as 
player level has nothing to do with success rate on tradeskills.
