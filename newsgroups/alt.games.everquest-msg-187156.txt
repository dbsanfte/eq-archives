Hello All;

I was grouping with a great bunch of people in PC last night. It was one of
those times when everything seemed to go right.  At the end of the evening,
I was invited to apply to join a guild.  This is the first time this has
happened and I was honored.

I'm new to EQ, playing for about 2 months now. In trying to find my niche in
EQ life, I've started 3 chars, a 15 shammy, a 9 neco and my current and
permanent one is a 24 cleric. I really enjoy playing the cleric and doing my
part in keeping a group alive and fighting. I average about 3 hours an
evening in playing and more on the weekends, work/family permitting.

I know very little about guilds. I understand the most basic of a guild; the
strong bonds made amongst members, loyalty, members helping members, giant
group fights (raids I believe) and I'm sure other positive benefits.

In playing EQ for only 2 months, one big thing I've learned is............
there is much to learn!!!   I've not been to very many places in EQ and
still trying to learn my way around.  I'm still awkward in handling my
character.  Last night during a fight in PC, I backed up and fell off a high
bridge (LOL). I had to gate myself out and run back. I sat under a mushroom
that was on the wall and couldn't stand up to cast (LOL-- fortunately no one
was killed till I figured that one out).

My questions or advice seeking, to the group is:

Why would a guild want such a newbie?  They would HAVE to teach me quite
abit about general EQ things.

Would it not be better for me to grow/learn more on my own before joining a
guild?

Isn't a guild a time demanding thing?  In a typical week, for a typical
guild, about what amount of time would be required to do guild things?  I
know this could vary, but, I'm just trying to get an idea of guild basics
101.

I work during the day (duhhh..) and can only play in the evenings. Wouldn't
this hamper my membership requirements since I couldn't participate in
daytime activities?

Joining a guild is not something I've thought much about. I figured I was
way to low in levels and certainly way to low in knowledge and experience in
playing EQ,  to even think about applying to join a guild.


General thoughts from you pro's would be most appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your time in answering.
