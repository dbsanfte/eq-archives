Good God but there are some stupid answers here.... Go to Fry's Electronics
or someplace similar and buy the Linksys 4 port Cable/DSL Router or similar
(Run from about $75 to $130 depending on brand - I have seen them at about 4
places in the Sunday paper) and plug it in.  You don't have to do anything
special or even pay for an additional IP Address.  It can have over 100 PC's
connected through the same IP address sharing bandwidth and acts as its own
firewall, home network (LAN), etc and the cable / DSL company cannot detect
it or say anything about it.  I currently am using 2 computers in this
config and have seen at least 3 other posts about others doing the same in
the last 2 days.
If you use a hub, you will need to pay for an additional IP address or for a
software package that does the same as the router but costs about the same
and has a lot more headaches.  Cable Routers are simple to use and handy as
hell.  Good luck.
