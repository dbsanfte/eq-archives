No because it wasnt a case of people being handed a major design flaw
where you have a central gaming system yet the master data for an
individuals progress is not held by the central verifier but at the
player level. Thats a mistake that was an obvious one, wouldnt have
required specialist compuyer game design knowledge and that wrecked the
multiplayer setup.....
