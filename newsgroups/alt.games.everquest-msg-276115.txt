In general, yep.

At what level?  That's true pretty much into the 20's AFAIK.

> It's kinda disapointing that there isnt more equipment in the game.

It's still new, for one thing.  There are also other design
factors taking effect:

1) You get good-to-great XP/equipment doing quests.
It's not like EQ where you mostly killed for XP and
camped/raided for equipment.

Even if you don't want the AQ (level 20 type armor)
equipment, you're still better off doing the quests.  So
(almost) everyone has them.   By design, that armor
will be better than most of what's available.

2) You can't use discarded upper-level equipment.  It's
like EQ with the only reasonably available equipment
being the newbie armor.

That's true for a couple of reasons, primarily the level
requirements on gear.   Now that everything worn
can't be traded, it's even more true.

As time goes on -- and people level -- I expect that
will change.  But there's little reason to have every
level 25 look differently.   I hope that's not true by
the time people are 35+ and definitely not by level
45+.
