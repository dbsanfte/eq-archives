It's also a tad more challenging with a shaman, as you don't get snare.  If
I could snare the mobs, I doubt I'd ever get hit, well, unless they resisted
snare.  If you want to avoid adds on the Revenants, there is a single spawn
one on top of the plataeu.  He is rather popular however, as that is where
one of the spawns for an awesome shield quest spawns.
