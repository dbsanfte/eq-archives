  Problem is, I can't find any spot in HoH where single pulling is
easy to do. I doubt I've explored all the exp spots in the zone but
I've surely seen most of them and I can't think of one where I'd be
able to pull singles withouth Harmony/pacify or FD. 

Generally though, I never solo for exp any more, if there's nobody
around that I know I'll play an alt or hit a money camp. All 3 decent
money camps in PoP that I know are soloable, as are a lot of old world
spots with nice items.
