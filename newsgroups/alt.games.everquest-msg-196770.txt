5 hour running battle last night without crashing or disconnecting.  Low 
server loads though I'd imagine at that time of night.  Oh and I'm a 
roleplayer at heart but that doesn't keep me from appreciating the 
combat, its a good team tactics game if you find the right folks to play 
with.

going to be difficult in the long run as I'd imagine each server will 
have a dominant team due to having a dominant clan.  Team tactics and 
organization play such a heavy role that once someone got their clan in 
place challenging them might become very difficult.
