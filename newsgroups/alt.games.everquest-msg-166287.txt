Humans create shorthand (jargon) for most every common endeavor.  It
typically serves to increase the effectiveness of communication (denser
information content because of the greater implied context), and also
to set the "in" group apart (be they doctors, preteens, or wiccans,
etc.).  So you are denigrating these folks for ordinary human behavior
that I am quite certain you engage in as well.
