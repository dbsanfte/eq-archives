Sounds like my CC, going through a painful divorce, and took it out on the 
boots.  Nothing like hearing your CC start screaming at the phone and 
KNOWING that a good 3 hours of pain were coming.  Didn't do a single 
workout session, though with our daily punishments we did more actual 
exercises than any other company.  Still came out in worse shape than I 
went in, since 5 minute pushups don't do shit for your cardiovascular 
system.
Of course he did show us lots of naked pictures of his wife, along with 
half the whores in Subic Bay, so you know he was an honorable man.  
(That's sarcasm for the uninformed.)

Fuck is a great all purpose word, and there's nothing like that first meal 
with your folks after a 6-month cruise when you say, "Mom, please pass the 
fucking salt."  It's rather limiting though, a true sailer uses fuck 
often, but not at the expense of other words, especially, cock-sucker, 
cunt, sand-crab, and whore, and any and all variations and combinations.  
Of course for the truly foul, there's my favorite.....
