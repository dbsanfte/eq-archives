Put 100% into AA until you get Run3. Then put 100% into regular XP until you hit
53 and get your Rogue pet. At that point you'll be a very effective aggrokiter,
so you can afford to split exp if you wish to pursue AAs. 

If you do decide to split, I'd recommend that you get Regen3 and then go back to
100% regular XP until you hit 65. You'll accumulate AAs much more quickly at 65
due to the higher "value" mobs you'll be killing.
