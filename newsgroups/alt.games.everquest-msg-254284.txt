Oh, ok, I thought all of them were spawned by killing the advisor.  At 
any rate I didn't see any wolves yesterday, in part because that 
huntress was always in the way... the one time we killed her, by the 
time I ran back in to look she was already respawned.

The advisor is correct as I recall, but that mob isn't just "inside the 
building" its pretty deep in, thru a zone that can wipe whole raids in 
the 30s pretty easily and chew up a solo character in his 50s if he 
isn't careful.

This is the best step of the entire shaman epic (well, except perhaps 
the final step where you actually get the epic, not that I ever took it 
that far), as your reward are insta click SOW boots, for a solo shaman 
safely freeing up a spell slot, and for any shaman allowing at least 
-him- to never worry about his SOW running out or getting dispelled, at 
least not outdoors.
