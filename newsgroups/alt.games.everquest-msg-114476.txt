I know what you mean, dude. I have been in customer service for a cell
phone company and most of the people don't even bother to read their
manuels on how to program their phone. 90% of the calls I recieve are
"my phone is broken. I cannot program it" and most of the time, it's
because they don't bother to read their owner manuel and when they
cannot program it, they automatically assume that we were trying to
sell a broken/defective product. I have been doing this for 6 yrs now
and every year as technology gets better, people seem to be getting
stupider.
