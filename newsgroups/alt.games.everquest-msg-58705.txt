Actually the type of PVP they have in DAoC is not anything like PVP in
UO---in DAoC, you fight against other realms...and only if you venture into
the frontier areas.  If you are not into PVP (like myself), you don't go
into the frontier.

As for which is better?  That I cannot say, you would have to find out on
your own.  I still play Realm, Ultima Online, Everquest, and Asherons
Call----although I play more of EQ, DAoC, and AC than the other two.  I find
there are things I like in all the games....as well as things I do not like.
I also still play Diablo2 but usually in private games as again, I do not
like pvp.  No, I am not a power leveler.  Although I have played most of
these games a long time, I do not have really high chars in any of them:
lvl 523 in Realm, lvl 45 and 50 in EQ, several lvl 30+ in Diablo2, lvl 35
sin AC, a admirable master swordswoman in UO, and a lowly almost lvl 10 in
DAoC.  But I have fun, and many friends in all these games.
Luckily, I don't have to decide on playing only one.

Most games you have a free month before your subscription payment
starts.....take advantage of it to try it and see if it is something you are
interested in.
