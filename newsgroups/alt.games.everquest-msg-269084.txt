No right now, you can't, unless they've fixed it but didn't mention it
in update note.  The reason is it was too easy to grief by rezzing
since there's no confirmation dialog - find someone who died in the
middle of a group of dangerous mobs, and keep rezzing them until you
get bored, thus making them accrue a lot of XP debt and possibly
keeping them from playing if they can't click the revive button fast
enough.  They're adding a confirmation dialog, but until that's in
you're not supposed to be able to rez people outside your group.
