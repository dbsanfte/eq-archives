Druids don't think the buff is a big deal. Like you say, it's a small
amount of mana. 

What makes it a big deal is how often people seem to think it's a
druids *duty* to cast SoW on any and every person who asks it.

And if you reach that conclusion, you'll still be wrong. It's not the
mana. It's not the time. It's not the money. It's the *presumption*.

SoW is not a right. It is not a necessity. It is a convenience.
