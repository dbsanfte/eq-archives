lol... he only recommended LOOKING, he never said BUY any! :o)

No joke... BPS Tunic is 7k on AntBayle, last I looked... Reinfirced Acrylia
Tunic is 5-900pp

Acrylia = AC 14, STR 10, STA 10, WIS 6, wt 0.7
Tannin is shop-bought
Acrylia boning uses water
Trivial at 242

BPS = AC 11, STR 10, DEX 10, STA 10, wt 0.5
Tannin is foraged (Yew Leaves from Wakening Lands... THIS is the killer
part)
Velium boning uses Coldain Temper
Trivial >250

BPS has Dex instead of Wis, looks cool... and is still pretty rare.

Haste... any is good, more is better... but then you already know that :o)

1 handed...
Knuckle Dusters are a nice twink item... same dam/delay as lvl 58 fists,
uses HTH skill... you could keep these until/if you go Epic without too much
shame.
Polished Steel Ulaks are good too... better than fists until about lvl 35,
and AC in the Primary and Secondary slots is always welcome
Fighting Batons are dirt cheap

2 handed...
No real advice, other than avoid Adamantite Bo Stick... procs a 3 x 75pt
rain, which isn't going to make you many friends :o)
