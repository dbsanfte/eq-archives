well thank you but i allready know eqtraders, i was just curious about the
fact these books were despairately empty so i was wondering if it's because
the game designers/GM's were too lazy to take the time to fill them up or
maybe because the players have to fill them by themselves with recipes.
It's not really a vital question for playing and having fun in EQ but it
sounded strange to me.
