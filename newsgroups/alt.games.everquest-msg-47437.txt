Not to bust on you by far.. but if jewelcraft is the way you want to go..
you may find yourself wishing one or more things:

1.  You have a higher level main for all the plat it takes to increase your
skill
2.  You have a high level Cleric to give your Enchanter those expensive gems
used to increase your skill.

All in all, do whatever you like.  That is after all how you are going to
have fun.  However, just be forewarned that jewelcraft is -very- expensive.
It took my Enchanter twink (currently level 30) around 4-5k to get to a
skill of 190.. from there it only went up since plat bars are 102pp each
(going by memory since I alot so much depending on how my main does after a
weeks end, and then I just buy however many I can afford with the aloted
funds).

Also, you should know that in Feburary (I believe it was) there was a patch
which had the vendors paying MORE for the successful jewelry that you
make -IF- you first enchanted the metals.  Of course if you make something
that will sell easily enough to PC's, GO FOR IT (its your best bet in that
case) but if you are working your skill up and selling rarely -requested-
jewelry like the ones with SV Poison, etc, etc.. just sell it back to the
vendor.
