In the case of my gnome wizard on test, no amount of planning would have 
helped, barring simply not levelling somehow while killing xp giving mobs 
at under level 11.  The required drop for all the armor quests, gnoll

to them going green on you.

Only quest item I am still wearing at the moment is my 8th shawl.  Well, 
OK, technically ornate armor is a quest too, and I have four pieces of 
that.

If only they would make alchemy work that way too.
