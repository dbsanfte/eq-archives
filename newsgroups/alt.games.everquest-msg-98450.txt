She needs to calm down.

Being a Christian myself, having read the Bible, and having spent quite a
bit of time studying sections of it, I've read nothing that indicates that
God is overly concerned about gaming.  You're not worshipping Tunare (for
example) ... you're gaming.  Big difference.

I've had the same argument with conservatives in my own church regarding
D&D.  That argument is a little bit tougher, as there is visible rolling of
dice (drawing of lots, if you will), as well as characters worshipping RL
mythological gods (Loki, etc.).

But ultimately, it again boils down to being able to draw the line between
reality and non-reality (I hesitate to use the word 'fantasy').  An argument
I've used successfully to get some conservatives in my own church off my
back is this:  Have you ever seen a movie that had you so enthralled that
you forgot you were at a theater and felt like you were with the characters?
If so, what's the difference between that and suspending disbelief playing a
game?  When they start in with the different gods aspect, my retort is, "How
do you know that <movie character from movie mentioned in first question>
was a Christian?  At no point in that movie does it discuss him/her being
saved.".  They typically have no answer for that, or else fall back on the
old "worshipping other gods" angle.

On the other side of the coin, though, I have to admit that another thing
I've realized over the years is that if someone is truly convicted of a
belief they will rarely (if ever) change that conviction.  I've known people
in my church who wouldn't go see something like "Titanic" because there was
nudity in it.  I can respect that sort of conviction, and will continue to
respect it so long as it doesn't try to impose itself upon the way I choose
to live my life or raise my kids.

I wonder if your wife is relatively newly born-again?  They typically are
the most convicted (and by my estimation, the most obnoxious and
hard-headed).  If so, she may not be as truly convicted of her belief as she
is of her newfound (and to a certain extent misunderstood) religious
experience.  Lot of folks who are newly born-again act in a certain way
because they think that now that they're a Christian they're "supposed to
believe/do <insert stereotypical Christian belief or activity here>".  Take
heart that it will probably plane out over time.

The only thing, and I mean ~only~ thing, that I can see as a possible issue
is coveting ... wanting some uber piece of equipment someone else has.  But
boy-oh-boy is that a stretch.

Well, that started out as a few lines and ended up as a rant.  Sorry about
that.
