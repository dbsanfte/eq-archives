Out of how many total AAs?  CA by itself doesn't make that much difference
(though it does some).  LR5 is very noticeable, especially on mobs without
insane attack numbers.

Nope, that's the dodge skill.  You probably see that without any CA.  All CA
and LR do is to increase the number of misses.  You can't tell without a lot
of logging, or just noticing that you live longer.

It saves more than that, but even if it were only that, if it turned one of
the rounds from a death into a survival, it seems worth it.

That said, CA/LR should probably be second-tier AAs, which you get after
80-120 AAs of other stuff.
