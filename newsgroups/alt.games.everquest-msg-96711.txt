Actually, the Venril Sathir that spawns for the ranger/druid quest as a result
of the VSR sequence is not that bad. He has about the same points of the
Venril Sathir (hard) would have but does not lifetap as the does. The Venril
Sathir (light) has a small dd that is about 500 points and any 2 clerics in a
CH rotation with 1 warrior of approximately level 55 can sustain Venril Sathir
(lights) attention long enough for others to kill him. The key is for the
clerics to get into a CH rotation and all others players allow the Main Tank
to solo Venril Sathir (light) for approximately 15 seconds so as to build
sufficient agro. Venril Sathir (light) is level 55 so he will responde to
normal Taunt and Agro factors, unlike some high level (63+) mobs do.

I have personally ran approximately 15 raids on Venril Sathir (light) with all
members of the raid being level 50-55. None being higher then level 55. And
with only 2 groups, mostly melee, and only 2 clerics. We did not even have any
enchanters.

PS> BTW, I am not suggesting this is the same for the week spawn of Venril
Sathir (hard). The one that drops the legs. He is more difficult due to the
1000+ lifetap he has.
