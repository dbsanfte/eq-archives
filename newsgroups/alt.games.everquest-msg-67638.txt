A ranger complaing of corps run, muhahaha !

Would you trade your sow for a bind ?

Actually, with a sow, you shouldnt die when soloing. Sow saves you ass so
many times, you are not entitled to ask a bind. A caster oom is a weak (near
dead) player, moreover in pvp. A ranger oom is still a nasty fighter. With
which player do you prefer to do a CR, a ranger sowed or a mage invis w/o
pet (malachite is on your corpse, u remember?) with only his invis to
protect himself, an invis which can fade at any moment. You complain you
need bind, but you and bards can cross zones quicker than any other melee
class. Paladin, SK can't bind, and also cant sow themselves. You are really
lucky (Thanks Aradune imo, he helps on ranger improvement -unbalance?-)

If melee can bind, imagine on pvp server. A wizard start fighting a monk.
Monk, as being attacked bind himself ... What the wizy do ? He bust all his
mana to maybe kill the monk, and the monk respawn and then gonna kill the
wizard oom ?  A big unbalance, this is why bind points for melee are located
in towns where guards are !

But these are not the true reasons.

You need a bind at gate, you need a tp, a tl, a heal, a rez, a sow, a cure,
sumoned stuff, buff, endure breath, imbued stuff ? VI makes us in need to
ask something everytime. This is why everybody communicate. By this, you
need to speack others, to group, to meet people. This create the social part
of this game. The lack of abilities of a class is the advantage of another.
A little 8 caster will be proud to bind the great 50+ ranger, and even more
if he receive a sow in reward or few plats.

Dont be selfish, share the power and communicate. EQ is not Diablo.
