Just hit 55 myself and it's exactly as you describe!!
In fact I thought the dungeon was bugged cause my XP bar didn't move in over
15 kills - not even a 1% increase.  I put 'em all into AA's and the bar
started moving no probs.
It's a bit annoying though.  XP is faster in a PoN group than in LDON
whereas before I hit 55, LDON was much better XP than PoN.  I swear I almost
sacrificed myself to a necro to delevel and test it some more, but then
thought better of it :P
