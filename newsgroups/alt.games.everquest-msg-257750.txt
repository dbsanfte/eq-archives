Hey Fox! I noticed in the EQ2 forums your sticky post on the topic of the
equal healing power of all three healing classes (yay, Shamans and Druids no
longer second-class citizens wrt healing). This is great news and clinches
my desire to bring Winterfury out of retirement. Nice job assembling the
information clarifying this, and I look forward to seeing you in the game.
Just got my pre-orders today and have been playing around with the character
creation system. Not nearly as nice as CoH's, but miles above anything else
out of SOE ...

Look for my posts as Winterfury.     /wave
