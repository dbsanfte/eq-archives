I think there are many other factors which could adequately explain the
slowing of growth in recent years for EQ compared to the kunark/velious
era. One is competition, EQ literally had none in those days. As well,
the barrier to entry is much higher now. Witness the number of people
who've complained about the lack of people to group with at lower
levels. I'd venture the opinion that more people have left recently
because of the massive increase in travel difficulty introduced by GoD
than left previously because of the dumbing down of PoK books. As others
have noted, I find that a few trips to far places are interesting,
however the 100th time you run from the dreadlands ring to karnors to
port to emerald jungle, to cite an old kunark design "feature", or the
500th time you run across west karana to be a huge bore.
