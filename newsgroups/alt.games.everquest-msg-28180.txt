It's too easy to find a non-group rez in too many zones.
Don't got a cleric in Velketor, no worries, ask nicely if someone with
a rez stick could right click on your corpse (and there are a lot of
them).  Boom, back up and running.

Yeah, but the problem isn't the end game for clerics.  It's the times
before they get to get bitchslapped by a big ugly dragon that's the
problem.

Nahh, not anymore.
Used to be especially in zones like SG prior to the recent set of
"enhancements".  Now, most of the dungeons are doable without a
cleric.  About the only zone that still requires a cleric for
non-named stuff is ToV.

Months?!?
One unrezzed death at post-50 is about 12 hours /played.  Painful yes,
but hardly months.

Actually, for Velious until they hit level 60 *AND* get Dragon's Bane
and/or Giant's Bane (although the latter is largely meaningless since
those "giant" mobs you need bane for isn't vulnerable to bane and
those which are vulnerable don't really need them...oh well).
