I made my sixth shawl last night, woohoo.  This was the second attempt.

I found an easy strategy for getting the sirens.  All it requires is one
other person to help.

I memmed 3 of my AE stun spells.  Mez the siren, run up next to it, and
start chain stunning.  Then your friend starts nuking/meleeing/beating on
the siren.  They die fast that way, and because of the stuns, they just sit
there.

The best place is over the cliff and in the water, just south of the
Skyshrine zone in Cobalt Scar.  There's a single siren spawn on a little
rock shelf at the water's edge, and two more in the water a little ways off.

I was already master level in most of the tradeskills before the quest even
came out.  The only one I had to work on was tailoring.  And I second the
recommendation to raise tailoring before you start.  You can farm the
tailoring stuff at little risk, or you can farm the shawl components at high
risk.

Already made the blank rune for the 7th.  The two holdup items for me are
the swordfish tooth and the royal blood.
