I ported a 52 Mag the other day.  He said he was strapped for cash so can
only give me 20pp (which I said was perfectly fine) but he said if I port
him near a bank, he can offer more.  He inspected my character and I ended
up with 5 INT items to boost my INT.  WOW.  A very nice guy.  I guess us
casters have to stick together :).
