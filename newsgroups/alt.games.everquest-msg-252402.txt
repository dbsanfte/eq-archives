True. 55% HP is about my minimum for pulling with the warrior.

With the way regen works now where the longer you sit, the more you
heal, you're actually better off just sitting until you get to full
then killing a couple of mobs and repeating the process. That's why
Temp/Virtue is such a huge booster for soloing. ... also, don't forget
that regen discipline you get at around 20th lvl, it ain't much
(especially at my lvl) but every little bit helps. 

Even at 51, it isn't that unusual to only loose about 10% of my
hitpoints against a blue. Not something you can count on though, those
are the ones that are just barely dark blue, probably within one or
two lvls of going light blue on me.

I used to hunt otters there occasionally with my shaman. Given some of
the shouting matches I overheard and what I saw people doing, I swore
that I'd never hunt those lizards. Kinda like the Ice Giant spawns in
Everfrost, some spots just seem to bring out the worst in people (or
the worst people, not really sure which). <g> 

I'm thinking maybe BW or Seafuries in OOT for 52-54. I prefer to stay
with the old world or Kunark if I can, mobs there on average, are
easier than in the newer expansions.

That would explain it, I tend to be pretty conservative in that regard
and bug out at about 15% if I know I have a bit of a run to the zone.
But even though I usually hunt w/o buffs (unless a friend stopped by
to buff me), I find it's rarely a problem. Warriors seem to have the
hitpoints and mitigation where you aren't at the mercy of the random
number generator nearly as much as say my monk back when I used to
solo him occasionally. With my monk at 20% hitpoints, I could count on
getting hit for max pretty consistently, with the warrior berzerking
that doesn't seem to be the case. 

Rgds, Frank
