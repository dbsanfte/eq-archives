   The TADL could not have been  monitoring my sig that closely for too long,
since I did play a troll beastlord up to, oh, 6 or 7.  She was called Teaclaw,
and had the face of the troll female that has a few parallel  scars across it. 
The story, had anyone asked for it, was that she had an "incident" in the very
early days of her beastlord training.  Teaclaw, unfortunately, committed suicide
when I realized that she would soon be getting a pet, and I already had two pet
classes.  Playing a third just seemed so redundant.  I'd been wanting to play a
monk for a while, so Teafist sprung forth upon Teaclaw's grave.  
   But I do hear what you are saying.  I would love to play one of the big girls
on a permanent basis.  The problem is that there are so few classes available. 
I don't really like playing melee that much, and when I do play one, I'd prefer
one that can feign death (playing a necro has taught me the benefits of that
ability.  One of the best in the game, IMHO.)  Shadowknight doesn't really do it
for me, since they seem like a water downed necro (remember, I'm coming from the
view of someone who prefers to play a caster).  Shaman I like, but I already
have Tealeef.  She was my first serious character, and I am attached to her. 
But, I do sort of wish that I had made her as a troll instead.  And I have given
thoughts to having her suicide.  But I sort of doubt that I will do so.
   What I _really_ want to play, of course, is a monk troll.  That would be
awesome.

  Not claustrophobic, but I do have a problem with dungeons.  Mainly, I tend to
die alot in them.  I'm just not very good in them.  Outdoors have always been
much better for me.  One can play this whole game outside with good effects,
no?  Or will I eventually have to give in and start to do the dungeon delving
thing?

   I'll run this suggestion past Lenny.  Sounds damned good to me.  "I can't
keep my full time job, honey.  It's seriously cutting into my EQ careers!"

Annie <--- Doubts she'll be able to pull it off, however.
