well, this isnt related, but I got reminded of this story when I read
yours...
A guildmate is doing the ac camp in sro, and i figure id port over and do a
quick track. well (big surprise) its right up on track straight away. I get
to it about the same time as som warior, but im level 54 and my dots do more
damage. he wanders off, i havnt looted yet. I know that jbnoots were
multiquestable, but i heard that changed, at least I wasnt sure, so I sat
over this corpse waiting for the guildmate to arrive.

Ack, up comes this wizard after a while (still waiting on my guildmate) and
starts looting the corpse... ack. But after a while he stops... corpse is
still there, and my guildmate loots the ring of ancients. I couldnt believe
it. The guy just said... "well it wasnt my kill". He was just looking at the
loot! Can you believe that coming from a wiz?

Id like to think im as honest and fair as that but sheesh, given the
opportunity I dont know. If it wasnt my druid who obviously has no need of
jboots, I dont know if my guildmate would have got it either!
