I did...news account is more portable than EQ account (I'd like to see a
company that uses Windows and needs their browsing ability remove Miï¿½ro$oft
Internet Explorer (and still get Windows to function).

I worked for a company last year who allowed us to brows and e-mail, never
mentioned newsgroup postings, but assumed they wouldn't mind seeing how they
allowed browsing & e-mail, and until some started to be bandwidth hogs
(streaming 56Kbps real player video...hogging the bandwidth from our at
least one 650MBps line) they even allowed downloads (then they just blocked
streaming video & MP3 types).  It was good while it lasted (until the
company holding our contract gave it to some cheap Canadians...but I'll let
the Better Business Burro and the stock market tell how that one turned
out...they deserved every bit of it too).
