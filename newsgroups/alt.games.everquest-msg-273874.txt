On a related note, I remember reading years back about a group of
school girls who got so fed up with seeing all the boys wearing
"Hooters" TShirts in school that they went out and had TShirts with
roosters on them and "Cocks" written across the front made up. They
got suspended, and turned around and attempted to sue the school over
it. Don't know how it came out. ( I'm on the girls' side on the
matter, by the way. If they got suspended, the guys should have too )
