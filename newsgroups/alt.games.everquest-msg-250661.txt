Even in the rain, I recognised him against the skyline. It wasn't the first
time I'd seen him there - he often used to gaze out over the hills, just
watching, he would say.

    "Hail, Kuloth", I called cheerily as I approached.

    "Hail, old friend", he called back, but I could hear no cheer at all.
This was the cold, hollow voice I had long feared. I became quiet and
watchful, realising for the first time that everything about him seemed
pained - as though he remembered old wounds.

He continued to stare out over the hills, and I knew he wasn't seeing the
rainy day at all. Finally he spoke.

    "I will never forget the day I sold my first bow. The wonderful feeling
of accomplishment, of producing something that someone would use - perhaps
for a long time, perhaps then to sell on to another, and so on. That
something I had made might attain a long history of owners and adventures of
its own. That it might aid many. That I had not merely done evil, but
wrought a tool others wiser than I might use."

    "I can never forget how we came together - how we had to guide our young
hobbit friend across Kith - do you remember? The undead! The fear and
confusion! The ultimate reward - companionship! And our dear dark elf from
across the shadowed wood yonder!"

    "And I will never forget, my friend, the day we and our beloved
companions fell upon Befallen with cries of delight and war! Our caution,
our exploration - our failures, the powerful ones that rescued us - haha! I
have never felt so alive as then."

    "Could I ever forget our fun and laughter running hither and thither
making my Darkforge armour? My hours upon hours alone spent hunting
lizardmen in the vile swamps of feerott?"

    "Could I forget, years later, our discovery that just two of us could
achieve what a whole group might, with the right tactics? A duo! A shaman
and a shadowknight! Our victories! Our glories!"

    "Yet there are some things I would rather forget."

    "I would forget the day I realised that beyond a certain point and until
I became an ultimate master in the craft, nobody would want to buy my bows.
Or the day I realised I could no longer really make use of them myself - the
day I turned my back on my chosen craft and began to forget my skills. These
hands, turned that day to murder and foul magics alone."

    "I would forget the day I threw my few pieces of Darkforge away - the
day I looked upon the Bazaar and saw my works made worthless. All those
hours... and a few plat buys better armour."

    "I would forget that the heroes who rescued us from the pit of Befallen
are now sleeping in the earth in forgetfulness of their own pain."

    "I would forget the day this great game of life - became a game in
truth, a tunnel with a faint light at its end."

    "I would forget the day that feeble light failed and died"

    Kuloth turned to me, and I was thankful for the freezing rain that
disguised his tears.

    "I am going to sleep in the earth, old friend. I must lie and rest...
dream... forget. We have reached The End."

    "and no, you cannot have my fucking stuff"
