But this is what creative people do all the time out of habit, isn't it?
Take writing, for example. I'll often scan a paragraph I've written and
remove one word to substitute it for another, just "for the sake of change"
because my aesthetic sensibilities tell me that the results are more
interesting. The art of song-writing is another example. The best songs
really are those that find a new way to tell an old story. Instead of "boy
meets girl", how about "I feel the Earth move"? Instead of "Dear John" how
about "there must be 50 ways to leave your lover". Change is more
interesting and more interesting means more effective communication. I think
the reason I sometimes say "toon", but don't always, is the same reason that
I'll sometimes use "regardless" and sometimes "irrespective" (but never
irregardless)!

I suppose if I had the same negative reaction to the word "toon" that you
guys do I might feel differently, kind of how I always find it a bit
offputting to hear someone use an awkward word like "whilst" just to be
different. So maybe I understand what you're saying here, but for whatever
reason, I don't get that reaction from "toon".
