Yes, I could see pulling while LOM if the pull was going to be easy enough that
there's going to be a net gain in mana; its slower but more productive and fun
than just waiting for FM.  Likewise, if the main healer is LOM but the backup
has plenty, so he can take over for a pull or two while the MH recovers.

This is what I keep coming back to.  20M as a temporary situation, maybe
(pushing it, but if its sooo safe here, fine).  20M for an hour straight as
policy?  Its not as though there's more killing happening at 20M than at 80M;
the limiting factor is still the same, how long does it take to get back to 20M
( or 80M) between each kill... or more sensibly, whats the pull rate that keeps
mana hovering at around 20M (or 80M) for the entire hour.

I've yet to see any response to this question.  Lots of wriggling.  Lots of
bluff talk about how the dungeons are so easy that caution is unnecessary.  Lots
of evasions about how being prepared for the MT to go LD is silly because the
cleric might go LD instead.  But nothing about what the advantage is of staying
at 20M constantly is, compared with staying at 80M constantly.
