Granted that when the Hell levels were removed I had just barely raised my
highest level character to 32, so I can't tell you about
pre-hell-level-nerfage, but when I hit 51 I went 50/50 with AA and exp.  AA
climbs way faster for me as a Bard.  I shut it off recently as I was 3/4 to
an AA point, yet not even 1/2 way to level 52.
