/shrug It makes perfect sense. Unless your hell bent on misquoting it so

I'm not really. And I never said 'Tough Shit'. Quite the opposite.

The object is not to penalize people with stuff they earned. So exactly. 
For you it probably won't change anything. Even this 'cash drain' your 
ranting against would probably amount to a few hundred pp year year.

However, it will change things considerably for people playing with gear 
far beyond there level. For them the items would need maintenance every 
other fight... costing them several k, and several trips to town for 
repair per play session. Which simply wouldn't be worth it.

Even if you could afford 1k per hour, the trips to get stuff fixed alone 
would be a real show stopper.
