One week off line as I recall until the corpse vanishes.  One day online I 
think.  For Rez, 3 hours online, not sure if there still is an offline 
timer on the rez.

As for cheap equipment, the bazaar is usually a great source for 
inexpensive equipment, particularly stuff that would do you well at your 
level.  You will have to make some money, I'd recommend farming some 
tradeskill supplies and selling them in the bazaar.  Spider silks, 
spiderling silks, bear/cat/wolf/rockhopper pelts of various qualities, just 
not ruined.
