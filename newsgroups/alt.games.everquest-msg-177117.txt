One thing to keep in mind when a group is almost completely silent is 
that they may have some other form of communication that you don't 
share, such as a guild or raid channel or IP voice communication, or 
they may be all playing in the same room so they can talk to each other. 
  When my friends and I play from the same room, most of them ignore the 
chat section of the screen completely, which makes life very difficult 
for anyone in the group that's not in the room.
