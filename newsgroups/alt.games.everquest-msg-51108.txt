As an addendum to my own questions, I found that just killing minotaurs was
enough to do it.  Did the scrap metal quest once, and the rusty black box
quest twice, but killing minos was quicker.

Also, Indifferent is sufficient faction to get the Regurgitonic.

Now, after I figure out what to do with the Shiny Card and the Iron Pellet I
picked up while in Steamfont, I'll be off to Surefall to camp Mammoth.  Just
hope he doesn't resist my Calm spell so I can feed him his up-chuck juice in
peace..... :-)
