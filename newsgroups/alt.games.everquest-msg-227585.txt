If the befallen banker wasn't a smoke-screen as someone else suggested,
then it is still "different" from the runneye banker.  THe banker in
runneye is in a bank. A goblin bank, but a bank nonetheless, with bars and
tapestries and some treasure chests behind the bars. And he's connected to
the "main system". The one in befallen was not connected to the main bank
network, and was not in a bank.

Except, as someone said, maybe there wasn't really a befallen
banker.  :)  I can see someone making that up to get folks to jump down a
well...oh yes, I can see that for sure. :)
