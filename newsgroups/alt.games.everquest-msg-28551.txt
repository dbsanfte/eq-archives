The other night some player in Field of Bone starts yelling "Help at
newbie ramp" several times; turns out he had pulled a bonecrawler and
also managed to pull a furbie (burynai burrower).  A level 30
enchanter just happened to be there also; she mezzes the furbie, me
and another guy kill the furbie after mezz breaks, everything turns
out fine in the end.  

A minute later, this same player starts yelling again, "Help at newbie
ramp again, I went linkdead and now I have two skellies on me!"  This
time enchanter says, "Sorry, can't help you this time"; he repeats
again about he went linkdead and now has two skellies on him;
enchanter again refuses to help him.  

It's too bad there are some players who think just because a couple
players helped them out once,, then they can just go ahead and keep
overpulling or pulling stuff that's too high level for them and expect
the other players to keep bailing them out.
