      I agree that items in separate banks would be great.  For any
server especially a role-play one, I think it rather strange that I
have access to coin at any bank.  Just how can the Runnyeye banker do
business?  How does coin deposited in Cabilis get to Qeynos?  Adding
banks might be good but make not only items separate, but the coin
too.  

     This could lead to a whole set of quests, much like mail delivery
quests.  Players who have worked faction high for 2 different bankers
could even get quests to transfer "purchase orders" between bankers,
much like delivering mail quests for the bard guild.  Doing the quest
would allow you to draw coin from the other account since you're
trusted at both sites.  It might alter faction higher between those
bankers & lower it with other races.  (Dark elves might not like
Kelethin bankers placing purchase orders with Crystal Cavern Coldain
bankers; Coldain bankers won't like Felwithe bankers pllacing orders
in Kael).
