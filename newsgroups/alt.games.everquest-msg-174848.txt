It seems to me that Old World caster mobs have hitpoints more in
line with their class, but caster mobs in Kunark and beyond have
hitpoints rivalling their melee counterparts. Maybe not across
the board, but generally.

But, yeah, when they tweaked their spellcasting AI to be more
sensible, they did seem to reduce the melee effectiveness of
those caster mobs somewhat. They still have the same max damage
numbers but hit for max less frequently than before.
