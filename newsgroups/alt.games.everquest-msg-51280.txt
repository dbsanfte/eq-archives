 I'd hardly say EQ was dead.  Finally they have some real competition, but
hardly dead.  Although, I do agree that DAoC is, at this point, the much
better game, I'm of the belief that only good things will come out of this
newfound competition.  I still have my EQ account and probably will at least
until luclin comes out, because I have a feeling that VI will really buckle
down on improving the game now.  Also, they can use DAoC as a testing ground
for ideas that players want but they were afraid to implement before.  The
real advantage, I think, that EQ has in the conflict between these two
MMORPG giants is that it was first and with a tremendous lead.  Many of it's
players, like the ones flaming you, will never give DAoC a try.  Many of
them are somehow offended by the notion of a superior game and hold
animosity toward anyone who has that opinion.  You must know this, and this,
plus the fact that you didn't state any reasons why you think DAoC is
superior, leads me to believe you are likely to be trolling.

Best Regards
