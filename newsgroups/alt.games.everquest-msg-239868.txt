I found FFXI enjoyable for a while.  I cancelled my account, though,
because I couldn't juggle it with EQ and my time was all screwed over
so I didn't have much time to play it.  I also found that if I spent
any amount of time off of FFXI and they had some sort of patch that it
would take an additional hour just to fix it up.  Reason being that the
patcher would disconnect or crash or something every quarter of the way
through, so I'd have to restart everything from where I left off and
already downloaded.
