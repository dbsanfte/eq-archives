Stay in the newb zone in WFP until you are atleast 5th level and can kill
all of the mobs there (con green)... Then head into East Commonlands and
stay until you can kill all of the mobs there (con green again) except for
things like the griffs etc. Then on the West Commonlands and Befallen... etc
etc

If you move over to Kaladim, there are a few easy quests that can gain you
quick armor to sell and some gold and some experience...   The Bone Chip
quest from the paladins guild is a good one for low lvls. Also, the skunk
gland quest from the Clerics guild....

Just a few ideas. This is your character so whatever you think you would
like doing then do it... start a trade if you want  smithing or tailoring
are good ones. Just have fun with it and it will be rewarding whether you
level fast or not.
