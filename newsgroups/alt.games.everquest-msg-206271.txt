Single druids are somewhat restricted in what they can camp for good cash.
Quadding giants is not a bad idea . Quadding seafuries would not be bad
either and they are very rarely camped. Camping sebilis dar knights or kor
shamans could be a quick 10k.

If you dont care about faction quadding otters would be an excellant
moneymaker. Any of the above will be boring as all hell. If you are 62 or
higher the humans deep in hoh can drop spectrals and are easy to solo. Would
be boring as all hell but both profitable and experience (they frequently
also drop 100pp merchant sell items as well as the occasional spectral)
