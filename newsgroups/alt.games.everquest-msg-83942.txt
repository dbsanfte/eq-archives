hehe nothing todo with what gear or not I have. Never worried me on 
that. I think it is the actual message. You are being inspected. Almost 
makes you feel like someone is getting too close. Much nicer if the 
person sayes do you mind if I check what you have on. I then have no 
problem.

As I say no message no problem, then people can inspect away and I won't 
want to be on a PVP server ;)
