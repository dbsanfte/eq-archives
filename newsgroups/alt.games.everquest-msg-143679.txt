Just curious, but what are the odds that the new phat lewts in the POP are
going to be far superior to any of the epic gear out there?  Already in
Luclin there is some stuff dropped which (imho) is better then epic (i.e
WindSpeeder)

If there are tons of goodies dropped from the fat cat mobs in pop, who will
want to waste time camping for hours on end for epic puny crap?

Figure new and improved Epic quests will be added?

I heard a rumour that there are supposedly some revamps in the pipeline

Take the Paladin epic for example. Total shite compared to the drops you can
get in NToV and Luclin. Admittedly you gotta be in good guild to be getting
the gear.

All I can say is wait and see, looking forward to PoP, can't wait )
