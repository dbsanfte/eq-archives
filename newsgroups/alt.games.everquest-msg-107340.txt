I normally turn up in Paludal at around 17/18 and start on the mushies till
I hit 20 where I move up the single pulls from the bandits. The double pulls
I don't start till 23. I wouldn't try using a caster for a double pull
either, but have used this method successfully on Ranger, Bard, Shadowknight
and Beastlord which are all pretty good melee wise. At 25 on the above
classes (last level in Paludal), 3 mobs aren't even a disaster. I think mid
teens is a little early for trying to solo Paludal, 17 is a close call for
good soloing classes even.

Equipment was similar on most - used the same set of Blackened Alloy for all
but the Beastlord. That along with Jagged bands, Orc Fang earings,  BALS,
BABS and a Blackened Iron Medallion is what makes up my standard mellee
twinking kit.
