STOP TOP POSTING.

Now, as to that possibility, easy enough to check. I believe that both
the necros' and the wizards' DD spells (been a while since I played my
wiz. Not positive, but I think so) do a certain max damage fairly
reliably, and that damage is based on level. Max goes up based on level
increase. Have one cast a bunch of DD's, then cast IS on them, cast
again and see if you can ring the damage bell for a higher number. 

However, if that is the case, it's a pretty crappy waste of mana in many
cases, as you don't get *that* much more out of casting the same spell
at higher levels compared to casting higher level spells.
