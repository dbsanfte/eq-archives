Ah! Thanks, didn't know about /dismount. Will have to set up a hotkey
myself. :-)

With me, it's one of two things:
(1) interrupting a slow heal for a fast one
(2) overly enthusiastic patch healer, who throws a patch heal pushing the
    tank's HP from 40 to 60 just as I'm casting a CH timed to hit at 30.

Special case of (2): shaman/druid casting their incomplete-heal spells
at the *same time* as I do, when I'm designated healer. As soon as they
hit level 58 some of these people assume they know my job better than
I do...
