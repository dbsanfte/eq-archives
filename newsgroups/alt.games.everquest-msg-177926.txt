I may try with a blowdryer set on cold air... It will take certain 
trickery, because I'm running two computers, three monitors and a brace 
of peripherals off only two wall sockets. No way I'm plugging a 1500W 
blowdryer there. :)

Did that. I positively *drowned* the CPU in it. It did help somewhat, 
but not a lot.

for a better one. Any ideas for cleaning goop off a CPU?

Thanks!
