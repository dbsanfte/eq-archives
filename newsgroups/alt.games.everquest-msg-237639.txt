Lords of Everquest is a full game, basically a poor clone of Warcraft 3
that attempts to trade on the brand name of Everquest. If you like LoE
there's so little connection between it and the "real" Everquest there's
no guarantee you would like the real thing in the slightest. You might
like Warcraft 3 though.
