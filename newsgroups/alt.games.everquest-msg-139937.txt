Well for what it is worth, I have a Sony GDM-FW900 24" CRT monitor, I run it
1920X1200X32@85Hz and am on the computer all day withouth a problem, have
yet to see an LCD match it's image quality, color fidelity and ANY other
aspect of that monitor except the footprint on my desk!! It is not a cheap
monitor but it smashes any LCD in it's way lol
