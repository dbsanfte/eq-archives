Friends,

I have run into a technical issue and need your help.

Since the Sep 11 patch, whenever I get to the Character Selection
screen, a lot of communication takes place between my machine and the
server (I have a 33.6 connection shared over ethernet, so I can
observe network communication). I have learned from experience that I
cannot get into the game until this communication completes. The
communication lasts for about 2 - 2.5 minutes. This in itself would
not be a big issue, however, when I zone, I am usually returned to the
Server Selection screen (I know that this is a seperate, unsolvable
issue). This means that just about every time I zone, it takes me a
grand total of about 2.5 - 3 minutes, extremely anoying. One real
anoying part about this is that I cannot visit Erudin. I'm bumped out
when I zone from Erud's Crossing to Erudin and by the time I get back
into the game, the boat has already left the Erudin dock. The problem
went away after a patch on Sep 25 or 26, and came back on the 28th.

If anyone knows of a solution that I can implement on my end, it would
be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Brian
