Semantics.

The people in it are very demanding, because EQ requires them to be 
demanding if they want to achieve their goals.

The structure of groups, missions, raids, etc which *is* motivated by 
the design of EQ is the major reason those people are so demanding.

If people could come and go at will, without fucking over their groups, 
ldon adventures, and raids then the pressure from those people to log in 
and stay logged in wouldn't be nearly so heavy.
