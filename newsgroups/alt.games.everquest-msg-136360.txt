If you take something that does not belong to you, that is theft. Therefore,
I think my analogy is valid.

Back in my newbie days, I found Crafted Gauntlets on the ground in EC. My
character is a Shadow Knight, so they weren't much use to me, but I could
have sold them or traded them for something I could use.

What did I do? I shouted that I found an item on the ground, and if they
wanted it back, they would have to be able to recall what item it was.

Naturally, I got several tells where people were lying, however one guy knew
exactly what I found. So I returned the gloves and made his day a bit
better.

Am I a saint for it? Hardly... I'm not even a terribly good person. I just
don't see the point of making people I don't know suffer for my own selfish
gain. It seems like a wasted oppurtunity, to me.

No. But you should try to find the rightful owner. Even if you fail, "It's
the thought that counts."

If you took $20 that was hidden in a library book, I would call that
serendipity. If you took $20 that was on a table that was obviously not
intended for you, I would call that theft.
