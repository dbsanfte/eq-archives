Oh, trust me.  I know where you're coming from.  Bogart is a half elf.
There are NO hat graphics that look good on half elves.  At least it's
not plate though.  The half elf plate helm graphic looks like ass,
with the new models anyway.  The old plate helm look was pretty cool.

Still, with the AC, Wis, and resist stats, it's worth the ass looking
skull cap graphic.  If I had the old models it would be different
though.  Doughnut Hat chain graphic was retarded.
