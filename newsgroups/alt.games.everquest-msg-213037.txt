Folks,

Aoebe last night scored a deal with an Ogre Shaman to imbue
2 stacks of Jade for the cost of the Mass Imbue Jade spell
(85-105 pp depending on charisma in EC tunnel).

She sang out her tail of woe to those visiting PoK, and found
someone willing to do the eight batches of enchantments in
exchange for the spell.

She's sending the jade to her warrior friend, so he can get some
Barbarian, Rallos Zek, Warrior Gear.  Incidentally, she noted that
the bazaar had someone selling Imbued Jade, but at five or six
times the cost.  The cost for Aoebe, due to the helpful shaman was
about 2.1pp per stone, outside the cost of the stone.

Regards,

Aoebe's Chronicler
