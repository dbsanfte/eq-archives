I don't suppose you could all server-transfer to Xev just long enough to
free the rest of our slaves?  Everyone is lazy there! (yeah, including me)

In any case, server-down and normal patches will *not* reset the slaves,
you are golden there.  They will be reset, however, if the server code is
rewritten, as it was at one point to take care of folks PLing off of the
unfreed slaves (they respawned instantly).

I also don't suppose you know if there is a level-limit on the turn-ins? I
have all the parts for my 26 cleric to get the shoulder piece, but no
freed slave yet of course to see if he'll respond to her hails.
