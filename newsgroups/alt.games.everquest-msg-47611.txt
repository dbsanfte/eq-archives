Sorry for highjacking the thread to a new topic, but oddly I was just
about to ask about this. I created a level one halfling rogue,
worshipping Brell, and travelled to The Hole. I got bound by the pool
outside and snuck in.
  Much to my alarm, the first elemental warrior I conned was scowling,
ready to attack. Even MORE wierd, when I successfuly sneak/hide, he
STILL cons Scowling! I thought nothing could see through a rogue's
sneak/hide!!?? What's up with this? Do I have to start this process over
with a dwarven rogue and get him to level three to get sneak? Has
anybody here ever actually done this themselves with a halfling rogue?
I'm wondering if it's just Norrathian urban legend all of a sudden.
  On the other hand, I got pretty darn close to one of those elemental
warriors, and though he conned scowling, he didn't attack me. It's all
very odd, and it's a naked lvl one character, so I'm really not out
anything but some time, but if it's possible, I would like to have a
corpse puller there before our party goes in.
Any help appreciated.
