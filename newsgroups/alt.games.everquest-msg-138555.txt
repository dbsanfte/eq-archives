The easiest item to aquire with that group is a "Glowing Stone Band"
(Ring--AC2 or 3 if memory serves Effect:Serpent Site (worn))

Drops off of the Goblin High Shaman in SolA (18min respawn with
place-holders). It is a pretty common drop, but not many people hunt
there, so it is rare to see it on the market. Gernerally sells for
between 200-400pp.

You can find an EXCELLENT SolA hunting guide at (maps spawn locations
etc): www.monkly-business.com

I hunted SolA solo from level 32-40 with my retired monk main many
moons ago. The only problem you may run into will be the changes to
caster AI making the Shaman, Wizard, and Mage Gobbies much tougher.
Greenie agro (not a problem for a monk with a decent FD skill) can be
a problem, so move slowly through the zone.

As an added bonus, Drake-Hide Sleeves and Legs drop off of the Goblin
Bartender, and are nice mid-level monk equipment. There is a Goblin
Merchant in the zone as well as Gnome merchants. This makes it easy to
unload the FS weapons and ore that will start to weigh you down as you
hunt.
