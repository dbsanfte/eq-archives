You don't seem to know what you believe.

Wouldn't you rather be working to make your peace with your God, so that He
will know you are one of the faithful when He returns?  I don't seem to
recall any of His commandments, or the teachings of Jesus, mentioning mai
tais.

How painful would it be for you to admit that, like the rest of us, you just
don't know one blind thing about what's going to happen?

(By the way, it's 'British' troops, not 'English'.  Please try to learn the
difference, they're not synonymous.)

Incidentally, why do you cross-post this rubbish to such a range of
newsgroups? There's only one in this list that looks as though it'd be
remotely interested in your 'end times prophecy'.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
