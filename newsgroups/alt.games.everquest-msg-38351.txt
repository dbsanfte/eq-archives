Did your mouse cursor freeze in one position on screen?

Also, when you /camped out, did you camp to desktop or just character
select?

If you camped to desktop, were any other programs open?

This sounds a lot like a bug I have to endure, I just /camp desk and log
back in and everythings fine, but when I /camp desk, I usually have another
program open, that wasn't open when I started EQ ( usually Internet
Explorer, but about 1 out of 4 times it's Half-Life or one of the 3 HL mods
that have links on my desktop.
