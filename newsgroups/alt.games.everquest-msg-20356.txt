I just bought a sohoware NBG800 and am getting the same problem....I
was using ICS but the ole computer i was using for a router was on its
last legs...never had a problem with ICS except that once in a blue

reboot....concerning the problem with the sohoware router...I restart
the router and the timeouts magically disappear for a while then start
up again...
