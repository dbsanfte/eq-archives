Every druid I've known uses anon or roleplay after 14th.
That way people can only shout or /ooc for a SoW and it's your prerogative
whether you offer you services.
I never give tells to people asking for a port or SoW. I will, if I am
standing by a Druid and I'm in need of a SoW, ask in Say. If I'm ignored I
leave.
I know how you must feel, or at least can guess. The amount of tells I have
gotten (in error) asking for SoWs, buffs or heals...I like to answer with an
abrupt  "No" and then let them give me a huge amount of verbal before
telling them I'm a Shadow Knight or Warrior :ï¿½)

CF
Actually now days I always have potions for when I really need SoW, so
rarely ask anymore.
