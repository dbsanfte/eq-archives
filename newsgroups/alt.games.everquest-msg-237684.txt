Hmmm Well I have a sound blaster audigy Platinum in another machine that I
can steal it out of.  But it doesn't look like it will do me any good.  I
contacted Eq support and got NO intelligent help there.  Things I have
already tried here is a copy of the conversation:

You have been connected to CSR Aaron M..
CSR Aaron M.: Hello Chris, Thank you for contacting Sony Online
Entertainment. One moment please, while I read your question. Thank You!
CSR Aaron M.: You would need to install a supported sound card to resolve
that issue.
Chris: so my Asus On board sound card isn't compatible?
CSR Aaron M. sent
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/ts_audio.jsp
CSR Aaron M.: These all will work.
Chris: well I have a system with a creative labs awe 64 that does the same
thing
CSR Aaron M.: You may want to delete the eqclient.ini, eqgfx_dx8.dll,
eqmain.dll, and eqgame.exe from your EverQuest directory.  One or more of
those files maybe corrupt, causing these issues.
Chris: I have already tried that and it didn't work.
CSR Aaron M.: Do you have the latest drivers installed for your system as
well as the latest version of DirectX?
Chris: Yes I have the latest everything, drivers, BIOS DirectX, etc... Ran
tests on DirectX and everything turned up fine.
CSR Aaron M.: Well, I'm not sure what it could be then.
Chris: So your saying you have no idea what to try to fix it?
CSR Aaron M.: Thats correct, I don't have any other possible info on this
problem.
Chris: Well then I will see what I can figure out.
CSR Aaron M.: Thank you for visiting our SOE Chat line, Chris.  Take care
and have a Good Day!


Well as you can see... little to no help.

-Chris
