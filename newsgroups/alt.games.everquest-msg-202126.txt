A fellow player mentioned to me yesterday that with the June 11 patch some
second tier Planes will be opened to players of a certain level.  He also
mentioned that Kodiacs Endless Intellect will be changed so that it can only
be cast on players 45+.

I went to EQLive
(http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp) to validate
this and saw that he was right about the second tier planes but I don't see
any mention of changes to KEI.  Do you suppose they will change KEI?

Part of me applauds the change.  An effective caster will choose a spell
that is appropriate for the situation.  Part of the process of picking the
right spell is knowing the amount of mana required.  A new caster will not
know how much mana is required or how long it takes them to regenerate mana
due to the ready availability of KEI.

Another part of me says "Oh Darn."  My new wizard has flourished and
attained a level of 16 in an astonishingly short time due to KEI.
