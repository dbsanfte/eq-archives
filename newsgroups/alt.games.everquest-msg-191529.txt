Hi, just thought I could help out on this. I'm in the navy and just came
back from sea and while we where out all low priority comms (includes email)
has been restricted. This is because all bandwidth needs to be avail to
ships conducting evolutions for the war that might need that bandwidth. Now
ships involved in the war might get small windows to actually transmit and
receive low priority comms, but due to security requirements outgoing and
incoming email is slowed. Another reason is that due to the backlog it may
have reached a point that just starts bouncing all email. Ships not involved
in war efforts have even been told not to use certain satellite comms due to
bandwidth. As far as this person being dead, I wouldn't worry about that.
Like it was said earlier, the navy is not very efficient in this area (don't
get me started on any other areas ).
