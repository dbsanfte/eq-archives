I've had this problem, too.  I couldn't figure out what was up at first, 
I'd suddenly stop hitting mobs.  I kept panicking, figuring I was going 
linkdead, but no, I'd stand there, getting hit, and hit, and hit, and 
not hitting back - then I'd realize something else had wandered by and 
'stolen' my selection of the mob I was currently trying to kill.  The 
*up* side of this is, all you have to do to target a player now is move 
close to them.

Ryou
(but with all the pita things that can happen, that's not much of an up-
side)
