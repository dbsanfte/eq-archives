Ok I will give you an bit out of a players guide I bought 2 years and a half
ago when I first started playing. Requires a level 40-45 Tank and a 40-45
Cleric, go to Rathe Mts via Feerott take the second left. This pass takes
you to a valley with Hill Giants they average dropping 30-50 plat each, with
fine steel weapons and mid range gems. With this combo you can bring in 1000
plat an hour each.

Bet you didn't know about that tip right
ROFL

Save your money
