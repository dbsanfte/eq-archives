That's funny. You seem to be the only one that responded like a moron,
fuckwit. And I asked a valid question, so who asked for the fucking
'get a life' editorial? I have a life. Probably more than you, since I
haven't played EQ since March. Didn't anyone teach you not to jump to
conclusions? You don't know squat about my situation other than what I
just told you, so rub your two brain cells together and show some
restraint next time before you post your dribbling opinions that no
one asked for.
