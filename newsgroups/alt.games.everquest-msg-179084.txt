Be aware that, at least in my opinion, the low to mid 20's are the hardest
times in a bard's life. It's a time where who you are is less clear. You've
lost a lot of ground in terms of your melee prowess, but you haven't really
picked up any of your several other major strengths (charms, chants, etc.,
etc., etc.). Most groups are going to think of you purely as a mana battery
for the casters ("Just sit down and play mana song"). It's also a great time
to learn some great aggro management skills (you can melee, but you don't
want to be a punching bag either if you can avoid it). You do have SEVERAL
good songs that come along in your 20's, so don't underestimate them. The
chain song (24 I believe) is HUGE, as is screech and charm. Psalm of Warmth
is nice for the damage shield in some circumtances. Casters will love you
for mini-mana (the 20 song).

As for zones: Definitely to HHP and HHK until in your early 30's (the other
poster's 34 is probably not bad). You should be able to find groups there
(indeed, HHK is overcamped on many servers). In the high 20's, you can
probably also find something right outsite Splitpaw in South Karana, and you
can do Aviak's even sooner. Mid 30's is OK for doing the inside of Paw or
for beginning to do LGuk. Both of these are tough, but not at all impossible
places to find groups on my server - your milage may vary. Around 40 or just
before, you're pretty much in LGuk or SolB territory for groups (Rathe would
also work), but you also will be at chant/swarm kite levels. You can look to
swarming Specs in the Oasis or chant kiting Griff's or HG's in the Karanas
or HG's in Rathe (major overcamp there, but excellent loot). By the mid
40's, Jagged Pine is great chant/swarm kiting and can carry you into the
early 50's. From there, you're in PoP.

Basically, I would recommend getting at least Luclin, and much better still
the gold pack (with everything except Ykesha), but barring that, you can see
that you still have options.
