Very few people spend any time past the first few levels imagining
themselves to be some kind of fantasy character.  There's not much
roleplaying in EQ, or most (any?) other MMORPGs.

I don't know *why* this is...although I think part of it is because
the game developers keep too much secret.  There is not enough info
in the game to play effectively, so people have to use things like web sites
and discussion boards in order to figure out how to play their characters.
That tends to reinforce the view that you are an EQ player, making moves in
the game, much like a chess player moving chess pieces around, rather than
you are pretending to be the character (what chess player pretends that they
*are* the King?).  This is not just an EQ problem...all MMORPGs I've seen
present the player with in-game decisions to make that will have major
affects on the future of the character, while not providing anywhere near
enough information to make an intelligent choice.

Note that the games that do attract the hard code roleplayers--the table top
RPGs--do give the players full information.  D&D players have access to all
the material concerning the game system itself that the DM has.

$9.9x, soon to be $12.9x, per month, not $19.95.

Hell, a warning label would probably help sales. :-)

This whole subject is complex.  On the one hand, Verant can't be expected to
require, say, a statement from a pschologist that you don't have an
addicitve personality before allowing you to open an EQ account.  On the
other hand, they *have* designed certain aspects of the game in such a way
that they will be way more harmful to susceptible people than they needed to
be (No, I don't think they designed them purposefully to be harmful, but
they have turned out that way), and so that raises the question of whether
or not they should bear some responsibility for the harm due to those
elements of the game, or should at least be under an obligation to change
those elements to be less harmful, now that they are known to be aware of
them.

Or maybe it should be like alcohol?  Bars are generally not responsible for
health problems caused by drinking, but if a bar serves someone who is
obviously drunk, and they go out and have an accident, the bar will be help
partly responsible.  Perhaps MMORPGs should send warnings to the people who
play more than 40 hours/week?  Maybe 60 hours/week should trigger a note to
the player's local social services agency?  (This so that they can at least
check up to make sure the player is only hurting him/herself...I'm thinking
of that guy a year or two ago whose baby *died* because he neglected the
baby while playing EQ).
