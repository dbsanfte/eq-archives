Yeah, my 40 gno wizard has 185 now and he has very very little gear.  I'm
not even trying...he's working on becoming the guild Hate/Sky porter (46),
and then TL to Bind (50) and then he'll be about done.  He doesn't need the
INT, the bastard.

I've found Wiz to be kinda fun though...after playing druid then enchanter.
Kinda fun having a mindless class like wizard or warrior. :)  "Buffs?  Don't
look at me, buster, I ain't got nothin' for ya unless you want me to push ya
somewhere. :p"
