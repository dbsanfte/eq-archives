    No aggro on the pet, especially when moving from place to place. In The
Warrens, for example, my level 20 necro can walk down to the Prince's room
without a thing attacking, but if she brought her pet (which is lower than
level 20) she'd have a bunch of angry kobolds to deal with. The mage can
summon the air pet, wait for the invis, then walk down with the pet and not
attract any attention. Not as important now that pet casters can summon pets
to them, but it has its uses.
