I hate wolf form, Ultravision on the 44 wolf form makes things hideous and
bleached out (sorry to the dark elves that have to live with it), the ATK
bonus is, um, pointless as hell, and the speed difference is negligible.
Also, I HATE the sit/stand situation in wolf form, I always get confused and
end up sitting down to recast root after being standing to med for 45
seconds while something is dotted.

That said, I probably will use the 54 wolf form when possible for the mana
regen, I also do use wolf form for 'infiltration' work in Oggok and Unrest,
or when I'm camping an Ice Giant.

I do keep SoW memmed when travelling, or in situations when I don't need the
slot for something else (in dungeons when I'm soloing that gem changes to
either egress as soon as I zone in)

My solo spell loadout at 52 looks something like:
1) swap spot, thorncoat, SLN, regen, Ro's sundering, port/gate when needed,
Imp Sup Camo otherwise
2) Superior Heal. Always.
3) Starfire/Ice/Lightning Blast depending on situation, Starfire is default
though
4) Drifting Death (although with BoR I end up using drones off my bracer
more often)
5) Breath of Ro
6) Ensnare. Always.
7) either the 39 or 49 root depending on situation (use level 5 root off
necklace normally)
8) SoW or Egress depending on situations.

My group loadout looks like:
1) swap spot, thorncoat, pack chloro, pack SoW, STR
2) Superior Heal. Always.
3) Starfire/Ice
4) another buff swap spot, usually keep pack chloro up here though
5) Shield of thorns/legacy of spike depending on situation (if we're keeping
one agro on one person, shield; if we've got ping-pong add or multi-tanking,
legacy)
6) Ensnare. Always.
7) 39 root usually (ghetto CC)
8) evac of some sort, usually Lesser Succor

My raid loadout is similar to the group setup, only instead of my buffs,
I've got debuffs up (Ro's Fiery Sundering and Fixation of Ro in particular)
