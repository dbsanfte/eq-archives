the feeling i get hes having all these problems only works as a pizza delivery
person .I really do believe the mother is paying for eq and his internet
access.Also i think if the mother wants access to info about what he was doing
on everquest,then Sony should have the right to check out what the guy was
doing elsewhere on the internet.10-1 hes been doing nothing but downloading
porn on the computer.I would love to know what he was doing on the sites.Also i
am prone to seizures and there is nothing on everquest like some games that
should cause him to have a seizure if that was the case he would have a seizure
every time he looked at a tv.People who have seizures from videogames and tv
are a result of rapid images and also can be a result of rapid lights,none of
which i have ever encountered in everquest.
