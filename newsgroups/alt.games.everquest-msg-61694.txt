> Its a known bug with Win98 - see microsoft knowledge base article Q253912

Yes, this is the other issue I mentioned, in this post, maybe another
post..Anyway...it's listed(not saying it's the rule) as these problems...

You may be unable to open an MS-DOS session (or command prompt) while
Windows is running. Attempts to do so may generate the following error
message:


There is not enough memory available to run this program.
Quit one or more programs, and then try again.
The computer may stop responding (hang) while Windows is starting, or halt
and display the following error message:


Insufficient memory to initialize windows. Quit one or more memory-resident
programs or remove unnecessary utilities from your Config.sys and
Autoexec.bat files, and restart your computer.


And I haven't had these problems...
