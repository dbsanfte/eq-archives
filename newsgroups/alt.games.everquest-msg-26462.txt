Only faction in Oasis is Orc - and who cares about that? (Nasty
surprise: A orcs are now named An orcs)
Orcs in Crushbone are the ones that will hose your dark elf faction.

Don't know how you'd fare in Overthere as a human, but I've known
human monks who weren't kos. You'll have lower faction than a dark elf
but should be able to do war braid quest to raise it, I guess.
