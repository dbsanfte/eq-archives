Just got home on the 15th and loaded up EQ.  Patch from the 14th came on and
dled.  Started loggon to server. It gets to the loading equipment screen
stays on it for maybe 30 seconds loading up . Then crashes to desktop with
no warning...Is this happening to alot of people since the 14ths patch? And
if so...is there a fix out there..appreciate the answer ahead of time.
