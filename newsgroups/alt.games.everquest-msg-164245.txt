Considering this is a newsgroup designed to discuss and ask/answer questions
regarding the game, the natural run of events is to have....OH
MY....discussions regarding the game.  This includes talking about the
positives of the game (hence the What a great night! posts that come along)
and the negatives of the game.  Are people not allowed to express opinions
here according to you?

Yes some people have expressed those opinions in a less than
mature/intelligent fashion, but that's just because there are so many types
of people on here.  But some people have come up with some good points about
the various changes.  When Verant makes a change it is difficult for them to
see into the future how it will effect things.  It's called Synergy, various
things working together to cause either greater benefit, or worse detriment.
Feedback loops, if you're into systems theory and cybernetics.  So people
come on here to discuss their experiences of the various changes.  We all
hope that Sony watches the newsgroup and learns from the feedback.

Same idea would be people that say that those that complain about certain
aspects of whatever country they live in (America in my case) should either
shut up or move to another country.  There are things I adore about America
(and likewise things I love about EQ) but there are things I do not like
about both, and I am going to raise my voice about those things.  Imagine if
the people who opposed slavery or denying women the right to vote, etc had
just shut up and dealt with it, because they had to either shut up or move
out.
