I don't think there will be one on any US server anytime soon, there
were merges last spring and the population seems excellent overall.
Before the merge I often have LFG up for a few hours or so.  After
merge I rarely have to wait more than 15 min before someone needs me.

If there would be merges, it will be mentioned under Town Crier
section of EQ forum.  Until then it's just a baseless rumor.
