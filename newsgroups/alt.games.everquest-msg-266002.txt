Argh, tell me about it... I have my PC basically side-on to me, so I 
have easy access to all the ports at the back, and also to the drive 
trays. Unfortunately, the door in my new case opens *the wrong way*, so 
I have to manoeuver around it to insert CDs. Bah.

This is the sucker... That fancy HDD muffler was the first thing to go. 
If I put a HD there, it was too far away from the other HD bays to put 
them on the same IDE channel. Trying to remove it, I broke off all the 
fiddly little plastic bits that hold the rubber bands, so it's not going 
back in. At least it makes a very nice holder for naked hard drives, 
which I use for external storage with a IDE to Firewire adaptor.

I'm beige-conscious. I'll buy any old case, as long as it isn't beige.

One more reason to get WoW instead of EQ2. Or alternatively, I could get 
neither and spend the money upgrading my ADSL to 2MB. I'll think about 
it after I finish Half-Life 2, I guess. :)
