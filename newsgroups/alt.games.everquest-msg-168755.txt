Ummm.....or.....NOT.  Looks like even with sound off and no sound coming
through my sound card I still have the same issue.  Three items share the
same IRQ (16), my GeForce Video Card, my SoundBlaster Audigy Soundcard and a
PCI to USB Open Host Controller.  When I go into Resources for any of these
items, the box that says to deal with these settings automatically (which I
would unclick to be able to change this IRQ) is greyed out and I can't
change the IRQ for anything on my computer.  I'm logged in as administrator,
since this is my own computer and all.  I'm running Windows XP, anyone ever
run into this problem before?

Also noticed that the Programmable Interrupt Controller and the VIA Tech
Power Management Controller do not have drivers, though I have no idea if
this is normal or not and I can't find drivers for either item anywhere.
