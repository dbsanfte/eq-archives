I had only one aggro on me as I was traveling across GD last night.
It was green and I figured I'd just outrun it, since I had sow.
Seconds later I was almost instantly dead, as you can
see from the attacks, it happened fast.

Near as I can figure 1 of two things happened, I lagged and
somehow the kodiaks attack got duplicated somehow, OR
there were several kodiaks caught under the world and the
original one aggroed them and all attacked me at once.

You know I never mind dying in the game when its my own fault,
believe me I have died A LOT,its part of the game no big deal.
But dying to unavoidable bullshit like this is just damn frustrating
at times.
