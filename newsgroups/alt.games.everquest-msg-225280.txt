Hmmmm - I suppose this makes the berserker a forgone conclusion -
just how are they going to differentiate him from monks and the like
I wonder?

> Quick Mass Group Buff

As much as we use MGB'd group HoT's now, this is going to be
a must have for clerics, druids and BL's

> Elemental Dire Charm

Well - the poll on the Tower shows mages opposed to this
by a 2:1 margin.

Here's why:

In a group in BoT (a place you could EDC) I have 2 options
currently to get max DPS - both requiring constant attention.

1.  CoTAM an elemental (not a lesser).  Dangerous but huge
DPS.

2.  Use a regular pet, but suspend/pet-canni between pulls to
up my nukes.  The other day I was dishing 4-5 black steels per
fight doing this.  I couldn't charm because we were doing wind
and pets don't follow you through those portals.

Now comes DC.  If I DC I give up the greater DPS of a non-lesser
elemental, and I give up the ability to suspend and canni.

Of course, it probably does greater DPS than a standard pet and
would make a nice way to be lazy and do more damage.

<sigh> So, are they going to make it so you can take
air form (and get it's resists) in zones where lev isn't
allowed?  Just have the lev component fail (or get rid
of it entirely)

I still don't see people using earth/fire much.

Heh - rogue loving - hope they're fun

> Hastened Strong Root

Wizards get the strong root AA?  This must be like all
the other "Hastened xxx" AA's from pop

> Exalted Companion

Hmmmmm - pet class aa?  Perhaps what Frenzied Burnout
should have been.

> Suspend Minion

Oh please let this be a 3rd level of suspended minion
that allows us to take pets across zones.
