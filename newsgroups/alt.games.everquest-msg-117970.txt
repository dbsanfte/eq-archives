I think FoB and Qeynos are both great starting points.  My ranger always
loves returning to Qeynos.  FoB is great though cause if you work it right
you can have a Iksar from 1 - 20 in no time.
I will include to good areas though EC, (I know I'm gonna hear it on this),
but when my rouge started there it was great plenty of upper levels running
through the zone every now and then one would stop to drop give a buff or a
bronze weapon.  Which wasn't bad.
