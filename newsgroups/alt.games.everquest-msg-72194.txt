I'm gonna call bullshit here.  At what level are you killing 4 mobs
every 4 minutes (giving time for mana regen and ignoring your confused
math)?  Which zone is this, and how many mobs can you really kill in
an hour?  If you're not sure, start logging, play for a couple hours
and let me know.  
As a point of reference, a well played bard can easily kite 20 blue
mobs an hour, which works out to about 2.5 blue an hour in your low
50s.  If you're saying that a wizard can take down 60 blue in an hour,
you're really saying that you can solo through 51-53 in about 3 hours
each.  Even swarm-kiting (a bard trick that make quad-kiting look
pedestrian), isn't that fast.

some wizards seem to have really really low INT
