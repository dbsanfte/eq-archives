    Once a camp is broken, or in standard no-adds environments like
Dreadlands, there isn't much crowd control for an enchanter to do. So to
keep them busy while you kill stuff, they go pull. You'll meet plenty of
enchanters like that as you level up - they're usually the ones that are
really on-the-ball.
