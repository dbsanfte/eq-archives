Really?  Interesting.  I'll have to ask people who have visited Mexico
recently, I'm curious to see how many saw that (of course this is a
biased poll as many would only have gone to "touristy" places).   I
can tell you that one of the biggest pet peeves of Canadians
travelling in other countries is being called "American".   The USA
may be our biggest trading partner and "good friend", but there are
several areas of disagreement, and the media/entertainment industries
often enough make us feel like our own identity is being smothered.
In fact I just got an e-mail from a friend touring Europe in which he
bitched at length about being called "American" and how few people
seemed to realise that Canada is a very different country from the US!
