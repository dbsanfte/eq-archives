I know someone will correct me if I'm wrong but i think there is a cap 
on damage until you hit 20. You'll have to level up some to get more 
damage out of it.

The message you are seeing is the 'proc' of that weapon.  You aren't 
high enough for the effect yet, not sure on what level you have to be.

Just did a quick search. That weapon's proc is an Area Effect spell. 
Generally AE spells aren't all that popular because they have a tendency 
of breaking mezzes and bringing in adds.  Keep that in mind if you are 
going to keep it.

Good luck.
