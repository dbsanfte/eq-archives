I was talking about tanking as in absorbing damage.
Warriors are usually considered the best tank even though most other class
can get more aggro than them, rangers/druids with snare,
shadowknights/necros with snare/dot, paladins/clerics with stunn,
magicians/wizards with nukes, shamans with dots, rogues/monks by damage
output etc
When a mob goes after a caster there is usually more than the main tank that
can prevent it - I have had monks pull and be main tank many times when no
warrior/knight was present.
