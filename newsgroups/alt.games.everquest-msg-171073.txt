Yes, but we're talking about *Christian* underrepresentation here.
Sanjian's point was that Christians suffer unreasonably from the
disestablishmentarian laws.  I would be highly surprised if he would admit
that David Koresh was Christian (not that I think he was, mind you).
Besides, we're talking about the 1st Amendment, not the 2nd.  The original
argument Sanjian made was that when it came to the application of the law,
the 1st amendment works in favor of everyone except Christians.  I want him
to give me an example of that, because as far as I've ever seen or heard,
Christianity is very much favored in the US as far as the 1st Amendment
goes.
