Yes, all of those things will pretty much happen. Evidently you also
will possibly:

1) ignore your spouse or SO to the point where they will divorce/leave
you. But the important thing is you made some new online relationships
in a video game.

2) ignore your job to the point where you will get fired. But hey,
10,000 plat sells on auction sites for about 90 bucks!

3) ignore high school/college to the point where you will fail. But
hey, in 20 years when you are a janitor you will still look back
fondly upon when you had all cobalt plate and were in the first guild
to awake the sleeper!

4) worst case scenario seems to be locking some small child in your
care in a closet while playing after you pummel them, whereupon they
die. This has evidently only happened once though so I'd not get too
worried. If you never have any children in your care its very unlikely
to happen.

Of course your mileage may vary ;) I think the "having less of a
life.. and NEVER get laid" is a bit dependant upon how much of  a life
you actually have and if you get laid now. This product is definately
not going to increase your amount of life or getting laid, thats for
sure.
