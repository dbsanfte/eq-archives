 I dont see this as an issue. How many people have actually "solved"
Luclin? That's the problem. Verant listening to the vocal super-uber 1%
of the playerbase and making assumptions and changes that apply to the
other 99% of the playerbase.

 As far as selling more copies? Hell, I don't think I even want to buy
PoP now. Seems like they'll be selling less copies.

 This change is more of a PoP prenerf. There are 7500HP tanks around
these days, but not a whole lot. And those that are over 7500 aren't
over by a whole heck of a lot. However, come PoP, where players can get
25% more HP just by making it to level 65, as well as the STA cap
increases and more +HP items in game. 7500HP will be trivial for
high-end warriors 6 months after PoP is released.
