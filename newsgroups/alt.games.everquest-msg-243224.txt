If you want to read the review, it is here at

I had some stupid ad for "Splinter Cell" pop up before I could get to the
actual review.  Very annoying.  Anyways, they have a couple of picture of
new models for old mobs, namely rats and bats.  They do look pretty good,
IMO.  
 
   But some of the statements SOE told IGN are dubious.  Particularly where
they say "-- Numerous bugs in old system eliminated". Funny they don't
mention the plethora of new bugs they introduced, eh?  Anyways, on the
whole it looks pretty cool.
