Not really comments on what you asked, but here is my spin.

First off you will be missed here (and in game by your friends no doubt)
It has been nice having someone here who is intelligent, gives good
advice and is willing to ask for help when they don't know something. A
bit of a change from some of the regular fair.

Second I'm not surprised that you are burning out a bit. To be honest I
always thought that you were on long term sick leave or something. I
can't really believe that you have had time to have a job, a life and
level as fast as you have.  From what you have said now it becomes clear
that it was the life that was missing, not the job :-(

Since you mention your wife, I hope that this is a joint decision.
Otherwise one or both of you will end up pissed off either from them
playing or not playing <G>

If I were you I would set-up a definite target of how long not to play
for, say just a week or two, and then think again about what you want to
do. If you leave it too open in your own mind you will either find your
self sneaking back, or never pick it up again, both equally bad IMO. 

Catch up with RL friends. Read that book that you always meant to, or a
brand new one (I can suggest a few if you like). Take the wife away for
a w/e, visit the relatives, visit *her* relatives. That should help you
put things back into perspective.

When you are ready to come back set yourself play nights and RL nights.
Just like setting aside Thursday for bowling set aside Friday for
"Getting drunk with cow-orkers" or Tuesday for "Film and meal with the
wife" or whatever. You should be able to balance RL with EQ, you are a
grown troll, err man, after all.

Of course having said all this my problem is quite the reverse, RL keeps
impinging on my EQ time. So far this year no movies a cinema, probably
40 on TV, at least 40 books probably nearer 60, dozens long nights out,
several stretching a couple of days, 2 skiing holidays, etc. etc.
However number of nights that I could play EQ in the last month = 3. Yep
3 nights for $9.98. 
Mind you I did do 3 levels (26,27 and 28)

And I get to play for the fourth time tonight <G>

Ho humm we all have crosses to bear :-P

Jim
