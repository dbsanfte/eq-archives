Hi Georg,

Thanks for the advice.

I actually managed to trobuleshoot this one myself in the end:

If I use my room-mates 128 k wireless connection via NAT from my PC it all
works fine, just not through my ISP with my modem. I'm satisfied that either
my ISP or my dialup modem is the source of the problems :)

However it gives me a workaround as I can play fine with my modem.

Thanks again
