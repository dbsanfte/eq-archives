	I'm really responding to the subject rather than the post here
because it has to do w/ naming filters but in a different manner.

	When my bf started playing, he created a character w/ the word
"guardian" in the name.  He played for a couple of weeks (roughly) and
joined a guild and he noticed his name was changed.  He figured it was
just something that happened when you joined a guild.  A few days
later, he created a new character (which he plays regularly now) and
again used that name, and that too was changed.  A GM told him that it
was the 2nd time she (I assume a she because of the GM's name, tho I
suppose it could've been a he)  changed his name and if he ever used
it again, his account would be suspended.  He asked why and she
responded that he knew why.  When he said he didn't know, she told him
that she had told him the first time  that "guardian" was a title and
not allowed to be used by players.  He had not seen her say that
however (when you're busy fighting, there are a lot of times that you
miss what's happening on the chat screen, especially if it's scrolling
by fast).  He then told her that instead of banning people for having
a non-allowed name that why don't they should create a filter to block
names like that.  She never answered.

	Doesn't seem right that he nearly got his account suspended
because of the name he used.  And I think he's right in that if
something like that isn't allowed, then the naming filters should
catch it and say "This name is unacceptable, please try again" (or a
message to that effect).

	I think I was more ticked off about it than he was, and I
didn't even like Everquest at the time.  :/
