Are you insane? Twink rogues-on-a-budget are born
with Slime Coated Harpoons...3 more delay but a whopping
3 more damage, too.

I remember how upset I was when I saw them when
Kunark opened up, not to mention the pre-nerf  Jade
Chodaki Prod.  I mean, my first rogue didn't get a
10 damage piercer until level 47 on a Fear  raid,
and it had no proc/stats (which my second rogue
character still uses off-hand...that Bone Razor has
been around since December of '99 and only used
by my main and my secondary...I'll never sell it!).
