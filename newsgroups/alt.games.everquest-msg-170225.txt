The way they portrayed Faramir was terrible.  It took away a lot from his
character.  I think Jackson is trying to show how weak humans are when
coming in contact with the ring.  The problem with this is it destroys what
Faramir was in the books - basically very opposite from his brother.  He was
much more capable of resisting the ring than his brother Borimir.  I didn't
like that, but I also don't think it diverged enough to truly make me hate
the movie.

I kind of agree that it doesn't show the ents being quite knowledgeable
whereas in the books they knew that Saruman was killling trees.  It also
seemed a bit abrupt that Pippin tricks him into going that way, sees the
dead trees, and BAM there's an army of Ents ready to destroy.  I have a
really strong feeling that a lot of  Pippin/Merry/Ent scenes were cut and we
will get to see them in the 'extended' DVD version.  I gotta say, the Ents
attacking Isengard scene was extremely cool.

I think the audience would have been intelligent enough for him to talk
about the 'choice' that she has since she is his daughter.  I'm with you, I
really disliked the scene of him trying to convince her to go to Valinor.
Again, it didn't ruin the movie for me, but I didn't like that piece.

Personally I find the woman playing Eowyn to be hot.  Not as hot as I would
picture, but still fairly hot.  I think Cate Blanchett was perfect for
Galadriel, and Liv Tyler even though I don't like her a whole lot, I think
she is doing a good job as Arwen (even though Arwen wasn't really in the
books).

The possession thing was the directors way of explaining how the King was
subverted.  Probably the easiest way for the audience to understand.

I also think it was an incredible movie.  Little pieces bothered me (Aragorn
falling off the cliff), but it's probably the best I could have imagined a
fantasy book to movie turning out.   Viggo Mortensen (sp?) is still my
favorite actor in it.  Runner ups include Sean Astin as Samwise.  The guy
who played Grima did an incredible job.  And I've gotta say, I liked Elijah
Wood as Frodo in this, much more than I did in the first.
