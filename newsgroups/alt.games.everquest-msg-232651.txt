Tholuxe Paells has 2 High end Euro guilds

Crystal Dawn who is in Time, at like phase 3 i think..(2nd highest guild on
server)
and
Tod Und Teuful, (5th or 6th guild) who is in the Elemental planes

The first is more hardcore of course, you dont raid 5-6 days a week 6-8
hours a day your out.
The second expects you to raid if your online but if your has the motto Real
Life > Everquest

Crystal Dawn, has a must be 65 with alot off class specific aaxp (Druids
would have to have spirit of wood level 3, mgb, and others for example)
TuT you just have be 65 and not a moron.
Both Raid CET time.

my soon to be cousin-in-law is in TuT,
lesia_kaboom@(removethis)hotmail.com
theres an _ between lesia and kaboom
email her if you need further info on TuT or CD
(both guilds are pretty good friends of each other)
or ;tell tholuxe.lesia
between 6pm CET and 1am cet most weekdays

a Magelo link and flag list would come in handy too, dont think either guild
is doing a reflag week right now, but guilds on tholuxe always cross flag
each other.
Tholuxe is one of the lowest non special rule population servers so theres
almost always something up to kill.
ill tell her to expect and email and/or tell soon :)
