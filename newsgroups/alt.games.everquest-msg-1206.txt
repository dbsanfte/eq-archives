I have heard that in AC there's some kind of formula for creating an
effective character.  That's not the case in EQ.  The different classes
are built to encourage people to work together in groups to cover each
other's weaknesses.  

There are still some classes that are considered easier to play or more
effective for some kinds of things, and you can pick a race that helps a
bit with the stats you want to maximize.  For example a halfling druid
with bonus points spent in wisdom or an erudite necromancer with bonus
points spent in intelligence would likely be effective.
