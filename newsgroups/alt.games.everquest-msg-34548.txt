Dru/Necro  =)  When I'm sitting there as a tree regaining HP or
contemplating life, my young druid's mind doth wonder about the path of
destruction a Necro and Druid could cause together.

The other guy that plays a druid, when we team up - I really think if he'd
LISTEN to what I'm suggesting rather than just running up to every mob we
engage and melee/DD'n it to death, we might not have to med every kill and
might stretch it out a bit.  Alone I can almost solo non-stop using
root/snare/DoT.

Anything you want, but bear in mind, if you go with an evil race, that may
hamper our hooking up initially until we can get you out of your newbie
zone - although I have had fun visiting my one buddy who has a dark elf
necro around level 5 in Nektulos. The guards I pass are just pushovers now
for the most part (except those dragoons RUN wolfboy run!!!) and cough up
bronze weapons!  =P
