Most melees seem to automatically want VOG, but with only 58% haste instead
of 70 for WR, maybe WR is better when you only have to buff a small group.
VOG gets stat and attack buffs too, so maybe it is still the beter one to
use. Id be interested to hear what others use and when.

Also, on a side note, Ive developed some respect for pallies and SK since
hunting in the planes. The mobs just stick to them like glue, way more agro
that warriors seem to generate. Makes doing my job (enchanter) so much
easier.

Last thing, does anyone have a URL to a map of PON and POD?
