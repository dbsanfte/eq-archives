Baloney.  A 35 Paladin couldn't oudamage a <poorly> equipped 49 Monk
unless the Paladin had his Str and Dex buffed over 200, was wielding
the droppable 37/36 2hb, had a high level haste the Monk did not,
and you were fighting very green (to the Paladin) Undead (so he got
buff proc damage too, thus the Dex buff above) and your monk waited
until the Paladin swung a few times before the Monk started attacking.

Tell us another one.
