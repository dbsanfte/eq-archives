This is of course true, but it's nice to have some kind of yard-stick.

Indeed. I haven't got around to joining a Kael raid yet, but I have killed
over 500 frost giant scouts, plus done all the quests in SS you can do when
you are dubious several times, and I'm still dubious. If I recall, it took
about 400 scouts to get to dubious. I intend to go Kael hunting real soon
