It's a two-edged sword.  By NOT providing a feature to "show me all
the alts on that guy's account", EQ provides a layer of privacy.
Privacy can be used by griefers to hide their identities, but privacy
also has positive benefits.

I'm actually quite happy that EQ does not offer this feature.  I like
being able to log onto an alt to play with my wife and not have to
worry about whether my guild is up to something.  And over in CoH, my
wife ran into the reverse problem.  CoH lets your friends see all of
your alts, even across other servers.  She had some friends who were
occasionally rather, um, coarse, which was okay with her, but she had
to tell them all not to talk to the alt that our daughter played.

That said, I would very much like to be able to add annotations to my
friends and ignore lists.
