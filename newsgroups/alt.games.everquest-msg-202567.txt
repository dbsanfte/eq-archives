<<And the thing that you need to realise (that at least 5 people have told 
you *other* than me) is that WHAT YOU DO EFFECTS ME. (well not you 
personally, but the xthousad like you)>>

Sorry friend, but I've yet to see anyone describe how me and the other
thousands getting a KEI adversely affects your game.  One guy whined about how
he might have people five levels too low fighting in the same zone he is and
then bitching at him about it.  I told him to move and or ignore those people. 
Other than that I haven't seen one decent description of how me and my buddies
having a KEI on affects you in the least bit.  Last night we were in TOFS
fighting with a bunch of KEI and were having an absolute blast.  Wasn't anyone
else in the entire zone.  World is huge now so overcrowding not nearly the
problem it once was.  So please go into detail and tell me how I'm adversely
affecting your game.
