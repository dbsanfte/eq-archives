If you dont mind to travel a bit - you have SoW now :o) - then goto
south karana and auction for splitpaw gloves, wis2 dex3 ac4. Youï¿½ll
get them for 5 to 10pp. 3wis earrings are 50pp a pair.

I have once gotten the Foremans tunic for 100pp,
but dont count on that hehe...try to auction for it in Lavastorm.

Goto Highkeep and camp Dylin - you need some lvl 18 friends
to help you here, but the testament is +10wis. Some highlvls
might kill him for you for free :o)

Black iron medaillon drops in Runnyeye, 3wis 3int...again
cheapest if you go there and auction it. Try to get it below 50pp.

BTW at lvl 14 you can solo the bandits that spawn along the ramp
to highkeep from east karana...three single spawns there, bronze weapons
and sashes should give you 50pp if you stay one lvl.

Good hunting

Aleoso 35th druid of Drinal
