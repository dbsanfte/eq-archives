No, I think you misunderstood me.  You can find examples of misplaced trust
everywhere you look.  Sharing an Everquest account with a "buddy" only to
have them steal it later is certainly one example of this.  And, as all the
threads centering on this topic have shown, most rational people understand
that it's been a factor in the majority of account thefts.  My point is that
there are other ways to have your account comprimised than to share it, as
in this case.

And that was it.  Nothing really to get all up-in-arms about.

My sense of humor can be extremely dry.  I amuse myself, my friends, and my
family from time to time.  Beyond that, life is just too short to dwell on
how I said this.  As for the intended meaning, my one-liner wouldn't
completely cover it.  So here goes:

Brad had his account comprimised through no fault of his own, and I'm sure
the account was banned.

But besides his "public char," he plays a private account where his real
life identity is unknown to the other players he meets, or so I've read.  It
seems safe to assume that he is very much into the role-playing aspect of
the game, as opposed to being obsessed with experience and loot.
Nevertheless, if he's played a single char or group of chars incognito on
one private account, he has probably gotten attached to them.

So here's the deal -- if Brad sent those chars to their final death with the
account they are on, that is in line with standing policy at Verant and I
respect it, however regrettable the event itself may be.  If, on the other
hand, he transferred those chars to another, new account before the old one
was banned, a person might hope he would then say to himself, "If I don't
want to live within these rules, why should Verant ask others to?"

It's unlikely we'll ever know which scenario took place.  So these last few
paragraphs are only worthwhile to the degree that they dispel (or possibly
confirm) your notion that I don't have things "in perspective."

And here we do agree.  I like Verant and I think they do try to do the right
thing most of the time, although they occasionally miss the mark.  Not to
change the subject, but I think Stonebrunt is a beautiful piece of work, and
is one example of Verant doing something very right.
