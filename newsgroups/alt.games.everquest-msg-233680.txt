Speaking as mage from the class with the lowest starting int (110 for
humans) - that extra 25 int makes no difference at all.  I have 2 
slots with no int in them at all, a +6int augment in the bank and my
unbuffed int is over 280.  I would need IE3 and PP2 before I was
able to completely use all my int when I'm raid buffed, or even with
a purchased KEI.
