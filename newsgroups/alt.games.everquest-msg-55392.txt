The druid making plat will be no problem when you hit 19. Get your port
spells and make the rounds at the druid rings and few hot zones and players
will pay for ports like nobodies business. Bard is a different story. I
would suggest different groups or explaining that loot should be rotated. I
hate auto split because all you get from others looting is the silver and
copper. Which I usually toss on the ground for weight ballast. =)
