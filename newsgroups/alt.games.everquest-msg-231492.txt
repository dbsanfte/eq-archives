For me, it's always been just the opposite. Even as a barb who maxed
out wisdom on creation, I had about 170 Wis when I hit 60th lvl and
around 210 when I first hit 65. I didn't pass 250 wis (or 4k mana)
till I got 2 +6 wisdom augs this weekend. Stamina, otoh, has been as
the effective  cap (200 unbuffed) for months now. 

I'm sure it's easier for raiders but for a grouping shaman, getting a
decent wisdom without sacrificing important stats (HP/Sta/AC) wasn't
easy.
