You have to activate your torch (place it in one of the acitivation slots on 
your characters inventory), but also as important you must make sure your 
graphics options are set correctly or you wont see them.

Max player torches - must equal above 0
Max torch intensity - must equal above 0
Max lights - must equal above 0

An easy way to test is to simply stand in a dark area, and make sure that 
max lights/torches is above 0 and set intensity to the highest value you 
should see the light start to form around you immediately.
