I play late at night and sometimes find it difficult to find groups so
my solution was a second account on my second computer. I have set up
several duo's that work very well and have been able to take them into
the high 30's low 40's with very little grouping.

I would like to do the same with some other classes but I'm not sure
if it's possible to play the second character with only hotkeys.

My current duo's are

Shammy/Monk
Druid/Warrior
Cleric/SK

Any other combo's that work with my setup?
