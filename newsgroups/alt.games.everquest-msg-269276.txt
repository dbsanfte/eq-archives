FWIW, one of many reasons I left EQ1 is because the game didn't
support older hardware very well (I'm very sensitive/annoyed by low
FPS, and playing at 640x480 is just plain ugly).  It sounds like EQ2
is trotting down the same path: Hardware requirements that'll keep you
opening your wallet if you want good performance and a decent picture.

WoW seems more flexible in this regard; that is, it looks fantastic on
a wider range of hardware.  I'm wondering if SOE made a conscious
decision to alienate people with older hardware, or if their graphics
engine just isn't very efficient.
