Since the other answers have all been confusing in one way or
another, allow me...

The rules are:

   1.  If you kill a mob that is green to you (or more accurately,
       green enough that you don't get exp from the mob), then
       when it dies, you get the message, "<mobname> was a
       trivial challenge for your party!".

   2.  This is a signal that any loot marked "No Drop", "Magic",
       or "Lore" which was on the corpse has just been vaporized
       by the game, so that you won't be able to get it because
       you're "too high" to be hunting that mob for exp.

   3.  All coins and all other loot (not tagged "No Drop/Magic/
       Lore") are unaffected.

The idea is to prevent high-level players from monopolizing
the zone, farming items for auction.

Personally, I haven't seen it to be that much of a positive
change, and it certainly cuts down on the availability of
certain items, which is a bad thing for players but a good
thing in Verant's view.
