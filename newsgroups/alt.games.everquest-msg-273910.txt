Yes, calling someone a coward is an insult, it's meant to be.

The most reasonable explanation is that the word is on the banned list
because it can be used in a sexist way, and even though he was not using it
in such a way, he deliberately went around the list to use it.

Then again, the GM might have the same narrow minded view on things as you.

Maybe for the likes of you we should ban all use of words such as beaver,
snatch, muffins - yes we all know when muffins are asked for at the shop
what men are really thinking.  While we're about it there's a lot of
biblical phrases we better get rid of too.

Go cry me a bucket full. The fact that you argue this way, yet at the same
time put a reference to a part of the anatomy which is generally regarded as
private, as well as obviously taking a swipe at a lot of people's religion,
clearly demonstrates you're simply out to be seen as being set upon by men
and the world at large but at the same time couldn't give a toss about
anyone else.
