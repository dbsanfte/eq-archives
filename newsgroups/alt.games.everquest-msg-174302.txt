I don't know very many of my shipmates who voted Gore.  And, given the
margin between the two, I'd say that the overwhelmingly republican military
vote is very significant in this election, certainly more than enough to
bring into question exactly who _did_ win the popular vote.

Because the "official" numbers are anything but complete.  I've just shown
how a large portion of the military vote wasn't counted.  In this case,
however, there was no nation-wide complete recount.  Hell, there wasn't even
a complete count in the first place, since it's not required.  It's odd that
you would demand that we accept an invalid number because we insist on
official numbers being used instead of smoke and mirrors, as if the fact
that the number is invalid has no meaning at all.
