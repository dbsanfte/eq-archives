	From where I sat, the people who created the name "Verant Ass
Kissers" were the morons.  They were unable to fathom the concept that
not everyone was outraged by the things which outraged them, and they
were unable to fathom the concept that intelligent, reasonable people
could play the exact same game they were playing *and still disagree
with them*.

	I read the official EQ boards.  I saw a lot of immature,
hebephrenic buffoons on both sides of any argument.  But the majority
of them were lodged firmly in the "bash Verant" side of things.
