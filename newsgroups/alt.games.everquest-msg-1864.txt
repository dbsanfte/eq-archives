I like the Scars of Velious.  Could they have done quite a bit more?
Possibly.  Instead of Gems possibly they could have added the ability to
minimize the game, but no big deal.  Everyone has different ideas on what
they would like added to the game.  I say Kudos to Verant for making a game
that has kept me entertained for 2+ years.  That is simply amazing if you
ask me.

Bottem line is that Verant is out to make money and it appears that they are
doing a damm fine job of it.  Sooner or later, they will have to create
another dynamite game like EQ was 2 years ago because the flames will
eventually die down.
