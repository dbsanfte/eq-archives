No, because I like neither.  However, I would prefer to play FF 6 or 7
rather than 10, even though 10 is shiney and new.

And when EQ2 and EQOA fail, they will move back to EQ.  They won't abandon
the player base until they have something to go to.  That would be poor
business sense.

SWG is the only one I think will matter.  Even then, it's almost a different
market.  Verant isn't going to pull the plug on anything that still has a
significant player base unless they're sure they can convince the customers
to move.  It's not a matter of more money from SWG.  If there's enough EQ
players to make a profit, even with full support staff, Verant will keep it
going.  The only time you cut a line is if it's costing you money.

Who said anything about oweing me anything?  Keep with the topic at hand,
please.

You're right, money talks.  Let's do a little excersise.  SWG brings Verant
2mil a year (arbitrary number).  EQ1 brings them 1 million a year.  What
does Verant do?  Keep them both.  3 mil/year > 2 mil/year.
