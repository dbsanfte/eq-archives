Hmm, youve got me curious now.. lets read on.  First learn how to quad kite
without the use of Camo, if it comes after you.. guess you just add that to
your quad. :)  As for the levitate.. well, maybe the answer to that one lies
in the rest of your message. <grin>

First.  Swim to the unexpected mobs, cast ensnare on them, then allow them
to follow you without losing them.  Casting Flame Lick is, well, different.

Thats why you do it first. ;)  Wait until you get the AoE ensnare then you
could probably get away with doing it something like you do now.

Not sure about that.  Not to bust down on you, but, this is a fairly
untraditional way of "quadding" else I've been doing it wrong for a VERY
long time. :)  How the damage shield is going to keep you from dying is
beyond me.  Explain please, cause I will admit I'm far from perfect and do
not know everything, despite how much I would like to, sometimes. ;)

Using my technique, I'm full health when I'm done. :(

Oh, well, this -never- helps. <grin>

Painell newbie area's used to be his regular hang out spot.

You stop pulling with Flame Lick. ;p  Seriously, dunno.  I killed him once,
has about 20-22k of hp's, got experience at the time with a level 55 Druid.

BTW, this creep showed up as a blank line on my tracking, yep it highlighted
I tracked him.. but, hadn't a clue what I had in store.  Didn't resist the
root the first time around, let alone many of them at all.

What god do you follow?  (diety) and where you already unconscious when he
hit you?
