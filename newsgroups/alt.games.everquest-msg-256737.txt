Persistant casting.

Which has a majorly big annoyance... when you duck to cancel a spell, theres
a good chance you will still channel through the duck and cast the spell.
Really dumb.. channeling through stun as the message is 1 thing, but its
pretty obvious if you are ducking, you WANT to cancel the spell right now.
Think ducking a cheal, to divine arb / cast a faster heal.
