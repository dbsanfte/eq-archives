Well sure, or find someone with their key on them.  But the point is
that it is so much more convenient to be able to do it yourself with
no worry that you have the key, but don't *have* the key.  The guard
is 50 feet away from the city entrance and he hands them out for free.
 It just makes sense to me to always destroy the paineel key.
