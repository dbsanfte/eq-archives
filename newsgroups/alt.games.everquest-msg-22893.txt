I think that's the point behind not allowing EQ to be minimized.  Right
now, you can't create a macro that could camp a spawn unsupervised for
hours on end.  But if you allow other programs to interfere, I bet someone
would figure out a way to automate the whole process.

Assuming the macro-user was high enough level to kill the spawn in one nuke
(to prevent runners), you can already do most of the steps now internal to
EQ:

/target Rare_spawn_01  (need to know the name ahead of time)
/cast 1  (biggest nuke)
/pause 100  (or however the syntax is supposed to work)
/target Rare_spawn's_corpse00
/loot

All you need to add from an external macro is a mouse movement and a right
click - I'm not a programmer, nor do I play one on TV - but that doesn't
sound too difficult.
