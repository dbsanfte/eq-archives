Really not too much to say. Hotkeys are critical, make them for follow, 
assist, attack, casting, etc.

The only real issue with two boxing in my experience is managing 
movement/postitioning; its virtually impossible to effectively move both 
characters at the same time in situations where /follow isn't 
appropriate. This has a few ramifications:

Have an appropriate exit strategy figured out in advance, its not the 
same as playing with someone else, you can't reliably run both to zone 
in tight zones, or with inc stuns... If you've got an fd class or evac 
class its much simpler.

Some tactics like kiting/fear kiting don't work as well. You generally 
want to be able to stand in one place, otherwise chars will be getting 
out of range etc... it can be done, but its usually not the best use of 
your time...

Other than that it can make eq a lot more fun to "solo"; though its 
pretty sad that the game requires little enough of your attention that 
you can actually play multiple instances at once effectively. :)
