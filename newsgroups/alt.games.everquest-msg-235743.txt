There's one caveat to the 50% rule. If you do the killshot on a mob,
any extra damage over what's required to kill it is also counted. IE:
a mob has 600 hitpoints and a tank does 599 pts of damage to get it
down to 1. A wizard nukes it for 600 and gets the killshot, wizard
gets the exp.

Unless they changed it recently, the trick to PLing with FD is to make
sure the mob isn't in running away when you FD. Mob starts to run,
person being PL'd roots the mob, SK/Monk feigns, other character kills
it. If the FD is successful, the other character will always get the
exp.
