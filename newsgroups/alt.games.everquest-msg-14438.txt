Also

HH Gnoll groups are good, and you can change up to HH orc groups at 16 or
17.  That can get you to 20 or 21.  And if you don't want to go far from
there, around 20 is a good time to move to SK.  Get in bird groups, or work
on soloing them.  There is a nice wide area at the bottom of SK if you want
to try and develop your multi-kiting skills, and it is next to the aviaks
(birds) which are good XP.

LOIO is nice, and you can stay there till 27 and get a lot of xp.  Slows
down after that.  The down side of LOIO is geting to it.  It is Kunark, and
there is a nasty run by some enchanter spiders that will stomp you if you
are not careful.  About one in 10 has see invis, so don't rely on camo, and
they all have Root.  Just take the time to con them ass you cross and you
are OK.

Steamfont can also be good up to L20.  Around the Minotaur caves can carry
you that far.  The problem is that the big minotaurs are more like L30 to
L40.  I don't remember the minotaur's exact levels, but I do rmember there
were 40s hunting them.  That large gap means be ready to run.

Once you get your first set of teleport spells, L19, you will be avle to hit
several places that are OK XP for you, and LFG.  If you get no answer, you
move to the next area.  SoW and teleport are great for getting you to where
the groups are.

The only "good money" thing I know of in the game is soloing giants.
Everything else seems too variable, or not enough cash.  The giant groups in
Kunark get good drops, but not every time and you are rolling against
others.  I was lucky one day and made 100pp.  But if you can solo hill
giants in Rathe mountains you can get that in an hour.  Needless to say you
can solo giants at 15.  It will be somewhere in your mid to late 30s before
you can do that.

Every other place I have heard about for making money is either a little
cash, but steadily that little cash, or somewhere that you MAY get a lot of
money if you win the rolls on the drops.
