Yep, basically one mob = 5 in total.

When you kill the first, they split, I believe aggro is based on who is
closest, mezz one, kill the other and its spawn, then kill the mezzed one,
and its spawn.

Did this recentley, have single grouped up to the 7th isle so far (the death
touch boss on pegasus isle was a bit of a pain).
