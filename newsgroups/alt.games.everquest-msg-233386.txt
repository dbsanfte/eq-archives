Of course.  It was the same with Illusion: Spirit Wolf, Illusion: Imp, 
Illusion: Werewolf, Illusion: * Elemental, Illusion: Skeleton, etc.  But 
finding the one or two places where they were actually useful was a large 
fraction of the fun in the spell for me.  So I'm -still- bitter it was 
nerfed, and even more bitter that they only apparently nerfed faction 
effects on enchanter spells, and let druids still play around with them.  
Pbbbbt.

You just wait, someday they'll take your favorite spell line and turn it 
into a junk buff.  Then you'll understand.

/em bitter bitter bitter.
