Aye, just checked pricewatch.com, needless to say, I'm going to really have
to do some research to see which one of those great prices gives more bang
for the buck, or atleast to the many "experts" and experts available via
websites. <grin>

Though, the GeForce2 is currently loaded and awaiting server upage.  I will
dilly daddle with this card first and give it a fair try.  Then I will
switch to the Rage Fury Pro to see how that works out.  I'll be sure to
share the results, though may wait to post them incase I don't care for the
results of either, in which case I'll probably purchase an entirely new
card.  Then if/after that happens, I will post results.

Pricewatch.com has a Radeon VE for $44.00, although Circuit City (something
I DONT case for moving from an area that had both that and a Best Buy) was
attempting to pawn one off at $80, this was after the $20 mail-in rebate of
course which usually takes three months to get to you. <grin> All-in-all, a
very informative site, thank you once again.
