Wizards cannot slow.  They can snare, which is indeed handy, but not in 
the same class with slow at all.

You can also succor to the zone line, which is great in LDoN, and you 
can TL, which is great when you are somewhere deep in a pre LDoN dungeon 
and one melee has to leave.

See there you said slow again, and slow wouldn't have helped you, but 
snare might have.  Since Snare and Root are both tools that wizards 
bring to the table, keeping them memmed at all times is probably a good 
idea. I've never played a wizard, though, so I can't be certain that you 
don't have a "running out of spell slots" thing going on that makes 
keeping those up when you aren't using them a problem.
