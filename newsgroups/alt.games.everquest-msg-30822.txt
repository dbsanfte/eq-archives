Heh, I had to force myself to stop buying stuff for my alts... low
level gear was just so much easier to afford than upgrades for my main
character :) I'm getting better, I've managed to ignore MoSS's being
sold for 1.5k no matter how much I want one for my SK :) 
And I am getting ready to shop for GE boots now - I doubt me trying to
camp them is a good idea...

I saw a picture of the new coloring of the skyshrine druid armor
yesterday. It's an even nicer shade of green than the kael armor now.
It seems I am going to have to try to get my druid uber one day in the
remote future, just to get some of that stuff *drools* :)
