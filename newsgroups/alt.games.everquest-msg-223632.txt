I believe thats all for the elementals, minus Fire.   For Fire you also need
Sol Ro minibosses and Sol Ro, in addition to the rest.

Before I retired him, my warrior was about halfway there, with Hedge, TT,
MB, Saryn, PoJ Trials, BoT key, Aren'dar,  Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek, Rydda Dar
(HoH C)

My rogue has nothing yet, except the only flag you don't need, PoI junk
dragon. ; )

I'm both lucky and unlucky at the moment.  The good side is that E'ci has a
very advanced public raiding system, which became Elemental Planes capable
around the end of June.  So the upside is that there are public raids which
can take down all of these targets.

The bad side is that they've been elemental for a while now, and I didn't
start playing my rogue until pretty late.   For the most part the main
raiding force is done with huge backflag pushes (end of September they made
a real effort and flagged a lot of people.)...  I have yet to meet the level
requirement to join them with my Rogue, and the Tier 1 raids she needs will
be infrequent.

There are other public raids on them which are not led by the good public
raiding group, so thats what I've been falling back on,... but those are not
the same thing.  Not by a long shot.  The regular public can run the Rallos
Zek encounter to the end without a single death.   The "backflag" public
wipes on Aren'dar at 50 percent, Rydda Dar at 75 percent, and loses to
Manaetic Behemoth with a 90 person raid.

Major differences in player level, player equipment level, player skills and
raiding experience, and in raid leadership experience.
