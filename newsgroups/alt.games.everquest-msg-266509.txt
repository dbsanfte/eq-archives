Are you sure?  While the druid pet is admittedly mostly useless, the 
shaman pet in EQ1 doesn't come along till level 34, and yet is on a 
power level with a mage pet; they get a new one frequently enough to 
keep up, and its not till the higher end of the game that I've heard 
anyone say the pet isn't pulling its weight  (my shaman only leveled to 
52, so I can't speak to the high end, but shaman friends as high as 65 
still seemed to be getting better value from their pets than SK were, at 
least until pet pulling took over from FD pulling and lull pulling.)

The cleric pet was also much more powerful than the druid pet, very 
useful from around 54 to 60, only the fact that there was no upgrade 
made it fade back down into the "useless" plane.  The wizard pet was 
essentially the same as the cleric pet, but not available till 58, so 
its usefulness was in the 58-60 range, and wizards generally have better 
uses for the mana, so it wasn't as interesting.

Thats not to say that the equivalents, if any, in EQ2 aren't going to 
all be on the Druid line of useless, but if the only thing you are going 
by is EQ1 equivalencies and guesswork, I think you're off track.
