I recently took down a HG totally unbuffed and solo with my monk. Took me
until level 47 to be able to do it and he was green to me. But man did it
feel good. I have done it several times since then but it's still a chancy
thing, the blues still kick my butt.


On a side note, I had thought that a shaman / monk was the best duo possible
and it may still be for most things, at least from a monk point of view, but
I recently began teaming with bard named Abner , in Rathe to hunt hill
giants. We are both lv 48 , and it's a non stop killing machine. The bard
snares then fears the giant and we both run behind it whacking it in the
ass. Not sure what level bards get duel wield but he has it at 48 , so he
does very good damage for a caster type and I've got a 21 percent haste item
on, so I'm putting out some serious damage also. We never take any damage
and only stop when we run out of giants to kill or to let me drop small
change. He pulled the tainted hill giant last night and I was surprised
cause I normally avoid him, but we dropped him like all the others, and the
corrupted spawned, same tactics, and he went down like no big deal. It has
to be the fastest I've ever killed any mobs. I'm seriously thinking about
starting a bard now, I'm so impressed with this guy.
