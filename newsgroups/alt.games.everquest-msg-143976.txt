I deliberately gathered fire resist gear because my higher level epic mobs
were fire breathers.  After doing cold mobs and fire mobs (with radically
different "maxed out" resists, cause I have little by way of cold resist gear)
I concluded that the resists were doing very little to prevent or ameliorate
damage, but that as I leveled up, I took less and less in a significant
and visible way.  At 54 I'd take full damage every time from ToV mobs,
at 60 I resist more often than not and almost never take full damage
(well, from the normal HOT mobs that is)

I still own all that Fire resist gear, but I don't put it on often, and I
haven't
put any effort into getting resist gear for the other resists, since it really
doesn't seem to matter much at all.
