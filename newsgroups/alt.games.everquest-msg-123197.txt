I am not saying you should feel you're doing something wrong for
using the words. I am saying you should feel you're doing something
wrong for using the words, knowing they offend/make uncomfortable/
insert negative reaction  here someone else when you could just
as viably make your point without inducing that reaction.

I call that self centered; your discomfort is less relevant than
the *astonishingly* minor effort it would require me to account
for it. I could care less if you swear like a bluejay in a bar,
on your own, with friends, whatever, where nobody else cares.
