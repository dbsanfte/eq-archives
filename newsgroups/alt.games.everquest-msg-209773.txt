Going by our server, the only people I could see willing to do this
would be a couple of groups of the local uber guild on an off day. Even
then, they might not feel it worth their while as even if it only took
10 of them, that'd be a mere 10k each. Remember the staff doesn't drop
every time so it might take a couple of trys to get it. Even elemental
guilds are liable to have a few members for which this might be an
upgrade. Any guild who still does BoT bosses as raid targets would
likely be needing most of the drops as well.

Again, depending on your server's culture, most people capable of taking
down a BoT tower boss with a small force might care more for their
reputation than the chance for a share of 100k. Not that they wouldn't
kill steal for a shot at 100k but an outright rip off the newbie scam
might not be all that acceptable on most servers, though on some it
might not matter in the slightest.

I know from your postings here you duo most of the time, but really the
only way you're going to find a guild you fit into is if you start
grouping in your play period window and run across people from guilds
you might be interested in or qualified to join. If you're north
american based, joining a Euro guild isn't going to help much unless you
work night shift and play during Euro prime time. It gets even harder to
find a good guild you like the higher you level as a lot of guilds tend
to group only in guild groups after a while, or with people from other
guilds raiding at the same tier as them, as these are people they know
won't be a headache to group with generally, something that's always a
risk doing regular pickup groups.

One suggestion might be to find your server's general discussion board
(most servers have one somewhere, either the vault, or a privately run
ezboard, and ask there for suggestions for guilds that suit your play
style and maturity level.

You could also try to find people through the server board to take you
up on the BoT trip option but it seems a real long shot to me.
