STOP! Before you do anything make sure that you con at least
'amiable' to the cleric Hrendi Mrubble before you give her the ring.

If you are at 'indifferent' con/faction she will take your ring and
tell you to get lost! If you are a halfling you should be at amiable
so you can get the ring charged no problem. However, if you are
not a halfling or an Enchanter(spells to raise faction) then you
are screwed.

If you want to raise your faction with the Priests of Mischief
the clerics in rivervale, there is one and only one quest to do it
and it is a pain in the ass.
