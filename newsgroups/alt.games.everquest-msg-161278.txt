Yeah is it just me or was the original promo "planes raids for all levels"?

Which would have been damn nice.

Then they go add 5 new levels..  I got 60 with my warrior then 1 month later
out comes Luclin with AA points and I can't enjoy 60 (used to be being 60
meant you could do more exploring, trades, quests and raids) but then again
I don't "have" to get AA points and they are quick so all is cool.

NOW I gotta level 5 more damn levels because I like being in a raiding
guild... grrr.

Please they could have fixed bugs, improved content in the existing zones.
But we all know what was really going on here. They wanted money.
Improvements to existing zones might add marginal cash and keep us players
happy but lets face it 30 bucks a pop times all the players willing to buy
the expansion. That's some serious year end cash.

And now there is EQim... ROFL

Just my view and its not likely correct but it is how I see it.
