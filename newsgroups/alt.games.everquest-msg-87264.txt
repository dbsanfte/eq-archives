Not to pick on you, jaZZ, but I've got to reply somewhere :-)

I remember reading in some [supposedly] authoritative source(s) long ago
that charisma had an effect, though quite minor, on faction
increases/decreases.

I was under the impression that this was common lore in the game.  Now I'm
hearing a chorus of folk saying simply,
No
False
NO
no
nO...

But I'm not seeing anyone say, "It's a myth that has been disproven by
'X.'".... Whether 'X' being Absor making a comment on it, or by folk who've
used ShowEQ, or a party of adventurers with varying charisma who have
disproven it by each counting the number of bone chips they've turned in to
gain access to Cabilis, et al.....

I am looking for the source (from long ago) that I got my info on that said
charisma makes a light difference.  It'd be nice if someone offered the
counter evidence in addition to the simple contradictions.  Not that I'm not
willing to admit it if I'm wrong (It Wouldn't Be The First Time I've Been
Wrong--TM)... just some evidence, even mere hearsay, would be nice....
