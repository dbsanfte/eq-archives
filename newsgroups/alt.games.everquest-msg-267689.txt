Hello everyone. I just recieved my Everquest 2 US DVD box and the first DVD 
is totally scratched!
I have a valid key to register and all but can't install the game.
Is there an online downloader that gets the needed files from SOE server?
If yes give me the link please.
I will have to get this DVD replaced but it's Friday and this means i wont 
be able to play over the weekend. :-(

Thanks for any help in advance.

(An FTP server with the cab files of DVD 1 would help as well)
