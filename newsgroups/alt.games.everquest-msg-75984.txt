You have to join a player made guild in order to get the <tag> above your
head. Your Newbie guild won't show up there. (Also make sure you're not in
/anon stauts, as this will hide this status)

The purple name is when someone is in Roleplay. Just type /roleplay. This
way your guild tag should still show up, but your race, class and level
won't.

Hope it helps.
