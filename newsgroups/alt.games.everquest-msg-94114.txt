I switched over to Legends mainly so that I could get a character switched
from a PvP server to a non-Legends blue server, which has still not yet
happened because they haven't put Stormhammer on the character transfer
page, and so far my impression has been just what I expected: cool, but not
worth an extra $30 per month.  So far I've only been to one event, and that
was the war in Ak'Anon between the gnomes and the minotaurs.  Although I
technically participated in it, I barely did anything because there were a
good 160-200 people in the zone at all times making it virtually impossible
to play.  Not counting the all people in Steamfont which is probably on the
same zone server.  I think they would be better off not announcing some of
these events serverwide so that every druid, wizard, their group, and their
mothers don't start teleporting over to the event area before the thing even
starts.

As for the Legends website, without a guild, at least, it's not very useful,
and I imagine it wouldn't be much more so with one.  I mean, I don't need a
website to tell me where my character is and what equipment and spells he
has.  The customer service is decent, better than on normal servers, but
it's not like you petition and two seconds later you get a response at peak
time.

So, in conclusion, I would maybe pay $20 a month, maybe even $25, but I
think $40 is pushing it too far.  I imagine Verant may indeed lower the
price since I doubt everyone who's on the server now is going to stay and
they need to maintain the population somehow.  But I should have a great
deal more playing time in the next week or so, and after attending a few
more events I may change my mind, however, thinking of what 12x40 is may
again change my mind in a hurry.
