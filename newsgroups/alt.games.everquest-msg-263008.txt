Having played warrior all my time in EQ(i stopped again just before
OoW hit), its primarily been my experience for any group to ask HP/AC
out of the blue, even if to just guery if you need a new guild. It
just comes with the job.. we are a gear-driven class and can make or
break a group. It also kind of depends a lot on your weapons. If you
go walking around with a CHoS/SoTB.. yer gonna get asked i don't care
who you are... but if you have a BoC.. and preferably a BF.. most
don't care.. they know you got gear.

Seriously.. don't take it so personally.. I would think after 70
levels... you would have gotten used to the question.
