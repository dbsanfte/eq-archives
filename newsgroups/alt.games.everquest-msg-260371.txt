I purposefully stayed away from Star Wars Galaxies and Call of Heroes.
I will be sticking with EQ and the only other MMORPG I will consider
playing is EQ2 because the designers have proven themselves and they
have the financial backing.  While Warcraft is a popular Strategy
gameworld, I do not feel it will ever be as successful as EQ2.  Shop
smart, play smart.  Everyone comes back to EQ.
