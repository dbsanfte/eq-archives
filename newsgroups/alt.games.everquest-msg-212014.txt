Id like to say it seems absurd that you would make the implication that he
shouldn't try to instruct those better than him, without also showing why
his instruction is mistaken.  If the only reason you have for the statement
is that James must know better because he is in an elemental guild then that
doesnt cut it as a logical argument, and is in fact mildly insulting to
thinking people.  Your faction with the logical just got worse.
