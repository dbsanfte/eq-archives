I play a 57 Warrior. I think I might be able to help a little.

First up check out the warr FAQ HERE. Check out the forums, its from
experienced highend warriors as a rule.
http://boards.stratics.com/php-bin/eq/postlist.php?Cat=&Board=eqwarriors

Second, check here.
http://steelwarrior.org/
The forums are pretty much trash talk but some decent stuff pops up
from time to time.

Anyway. Create that Ogre warrior. It is a true powergamers choice. The
most difficult stat to Max (255) for all classes is Stamina, and Ogres
Warriors have the most of any class/race. Stamina represents the base
hitpoints for your character. As a tank your gods are Levels, Armor
Class, And Hitpoints. Levels are easy, Armor is more tricky but
doable, and hitpoints are governed by stamina. So put as many points
into STA as you can up front. Then focus on getting your other stats
over 75 as previosly stated. Ignore Charisma, Intelligence and Wisdom.

STR gear will come over time, and DEX and AGI effect few REALLY useful
facets of the game.

The only true challenge that is unique to an Ogre is size. Make
friends witha  shaman, and stick by his side. Shaman's can shrink you
which makes tight confines more manageable.

Aim for a full set of Bronze and an Axe of the Ironback as soon as
possible (this may not be easy), and you are well on your way. IMHO
ignore trade skills until later, when you have the cash to splurge on
them.
