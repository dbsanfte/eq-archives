In addition to the many other strategies suggested in this thread, another use
is as a "poor man's mez"

Root a mob, then use your Lull line of spells to reduce its aggro range, then
atone to clear aggro, and as long as you stay out of its new reduced aggro
range, it won't re-acquire you as a target.

This doesn't really rate more than a footnote for normal use, but there are some
mobs which are immune to mez but not to this strategy, and I have made use of it
from time to time in places like Kael Drakkar, where the fights are long enough
that mere root parking had some trouble working (those giants have very long
arms, too)
