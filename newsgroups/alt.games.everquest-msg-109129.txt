Yeah, that'd be much closer to 'true' evil than mere selfishness. But then 
you gotta look at why the 'evil' person experiences that joy.  Consider 
the 'joy' or 'relief' the family of a murder victim might experience as 
they watch the murderer put to death by state-sanctioned supposedly not 
cruel an unusual methods.  Is that evil?  For them to 'enjoy' this 
revenge? 

Does it magically become evil if later evidence is found to show that the 
accused did not actually commit the murder in question?

Is it evil if the reason for enjoyment of another's suffering is not 
understood by the majority, is imaginary, or cultural?  A Dark Elf may 
enjoy a Halfling's suffering.  Dark Elves are 'evil', so no suprise there 
:).  But Dark Elves may also have a legitimate gripe with a race that is 
invading their territory and even their home city, and how many young, 
innocent Dark Elves have been slain by the EEEvil Deputy Leatherfoot?
