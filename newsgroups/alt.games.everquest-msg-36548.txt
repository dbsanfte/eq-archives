As I understand it, the only thing that affects your success rate is
your current skill level. The higher of INT or WIS affects your chance
to get a skillup on that attempt (failed or not). Some skills have other
stats that can work like INT/WIS, such as STR for smithing, so as not to
give Warriors the shaft on a traditional warrior-type craft. So a
warrior smithing should concentrate on getting his strength up for
smithing, whereas a druid should get his WIS up for the same effect.

The trade cookbook is an old wives tale. INT does indeed affect
skillups, but given your high WIS I would ignore INT in favour of
getting your WIS higher. CHA is useful only for buying materials and
selling the results to merchants for better rates.
