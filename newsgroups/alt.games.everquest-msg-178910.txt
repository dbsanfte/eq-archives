Normally what they mean by a safe spot is where you go when you enter a
zone and the zone doesn't know what to do with you, so it puts you in a
safe spot.  In Lavastorm the safe spot used to be under the world in the
lava.  There's also a spell a couple classes have spells that will
transport them to the safe spot, I think wizard's one is Abscond, but
I'm not sure.

Of course they could mean spots that monsters won't follow to attack to
that are exploits, I know of at least two in Paludal...
