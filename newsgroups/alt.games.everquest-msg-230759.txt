Did run 3 / regen 3 before level 55.  Then leveled to 62 before starting
real AA'ing, for the mere fact that at 62 you can fight in tier 3 planes
(Halls of Honor, Toriden etc), where the exp is much faster than anywhere
else (which is what rangers need, am3/eq is kind of overrated but it is so
much easier to get groups if you have it).
