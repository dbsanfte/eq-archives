"Easiest" and "cheapest" don't go hand in hand, unfortunately.
Picking "easiest" because you can't put a price on sanity. :)

All:  GoD freebie to 55. Mildly annoying, but cheap way to
start all your tradeskills if you own GoD.

Faydwer Shakers to ~180
Minotaur Hero Brew onwards

Both use store-bought ingredients, and compared to other
tradeskills, it works out cheap.

> Tailoring 20

Ooh boy.
Woven mandrake to 66
Cured silk till trivial
Now it gets expensive
LoY ribbons to 187

Leave it there unless you need it higher.

Buy/make a fisherman's companion, summon a rod, and put one of
those drinking bird things on your "fish" key. ;)
