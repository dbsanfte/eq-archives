The 760 Plate Chest from Mir ain't exactly awful:
Malevolent Breastplate of Suffering
AC:63, Str:10, Dex:9, Wis:8, Int:8, HP:75, Mana:75, FR:9, DR:9, PR:9,
type1,type2,type3
and it's a much cheaper way to get that FT2 aug into your kit.

Also, there's a cheap (340ap) FT1 aug (type 3) in Tak that fits
in _any_ piece of gear with a type 3 slot (i.e. could be another
piece of the 760ap Malevolent from MC, for instance).
