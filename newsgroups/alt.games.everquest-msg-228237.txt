Any word on when they're going to fix the graphic crash issues?  I had just
gotten an invite to a group when I crashed today.  I'd already crashed
twice, the second time to the BSOD, and let the system do its thing and
check the disk/fix things, all that.  I'm usually fine then, but
noooooooooooooooo.  It happened again.

Several times.

I gave up.  Maybe I'll try later, but my poor computer is giving me doe eyes
and asking why I keep hurting it.  This happens ONLY in EverQuest.  NO other
program will initiate it.  (I will occasionally crash on a corrupt save file
in SMAC, but never to the BSOD, and I can always play around it.)

Grar!!  I feel bad for the guys I left Enchanterless--I couldn't even stay
in enough to tell 'em.  (I've since rebooted again, another scandisk.  Doing
one more clean reboot before I try to play again.)

At least it happened before we'd gotten an adventure. ;/
