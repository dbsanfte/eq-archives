Legit, new player way to make fast cash.

Save all the Bone Chips from decayed skels and sell
At level 5, start hunting Bears.  Save all the High Quality Bear Pelts and
sell them to the high level tailors.  Some have offered up to 25pp for these
on my server.
Save all the Spiderling, Spider silks and sell when you see an auction.
Save all the High Quality Cat Pelts..Sell to customer in auction when you
see one looking for them


First items to buy with this new found cash is a tailoring kit, or Magic
weapon that your class can use.

Tailoring kit will enable you to make patchwork armor.  Dramatic difference
in the damage you take with some of this low level armor on, compared to
being butt naked.

Once you obtain a Magic Weapon, start hunting wisps.  Save all the
Lightstones and Greater Lightstones.  Sell them to players for 9pp each, or
if you can make the journey being a good race, take a run to North Karana
and do the Greater Lightstone quest for nice experience and nice money in
return if you sell back the item she gives you for each Greater lightstone.

Get in an Orc group at East commons and save all the Deathfist belts.  high
level players who want to level their alts fast will pay up to 3pp each for
these belts on my server.
