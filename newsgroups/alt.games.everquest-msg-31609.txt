You got damned lucky.  I had Invis to Undead cast on me by a friendly high
level SK (I think).  I was going from WC to HP, it dropped about halfway
between Rivervale and HP.  Next thing I saw was Undead something(Lieutenant?
maybe) is casting.  I was beating feet with sow up as fast as I could for
HP.  LOADING...PLEASE WAIT.  Might have taken two spells, but I don't think
so.  I don't remember for sure what level I was at the time, it was my
shaman, high teens, low 20s.
