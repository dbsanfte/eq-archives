People who missed the previous post should read the thread and then they 
won't have that problem. A lot of times I might not be bothered and pick 
up the conversation where it is or somewhere near the end if it's a long 
thread.

People on usenet are very particular about such things as top posting, 
bottom posting, crossposting and I forget what else although I am 
comforted by the knowledge that if I offend them, they will let me know 
right away, sometimes in the harshest of terms so as to get my full 
attention!

Don't let the posting this way or that way lectures get you down. 
Telling people how to post is a favorite pastime of some on Usenet. I do 
agree very much with posting at the bottom and quoting above only the 
relevant text, if that text is lengthy. Even then, if the text isn't 
lengthy I don't waste my time snipping. But I have never instructed 
someone who is posting on the bottom to do it "my way" or "the accepted 
standard way" or whatever. Life is too short to be hassling people over 
trivia. Live and let live as they say.

If this is your first experience in being lectured about "the rules" 
then you must be even newer than I am. Welcome to the fray my friend. 
Don't worry, amidst the briars you find some real roses here. There are 
a lot of very nice people to discuss things with.

It is true that everyone posting in the same fashion does make for 
easier reading though and having said that, I think you may find you 
like quoting relevant text above and replying below after you have tried 
it for a while if you choose to do so.

As kind people have said to me ingame, Welcome friend. :-)
