That is a problem. It is balanced by the safety of the fight and the
fact that the pets need little supervision once they engage the
target.

For the most part you are correct. That assembly will be able to do
more damage than 5 Necro pets. The thing is, that assembly would also
*take* more damage than the 5 Necros would. Assuming the Necros are
competent the only damage they will ever take from the mob is from
range attacks or spells. Pets are expendable, PCs are not.

Depending on the levels of the Necros involved you can get (I think)
up to eight DoTs in a full stack. Only things I ever regularly used
more than three on at level 52 were the lesser dragonkin. Nothing else
had enough hit points to make it worthwhile.

Not the pack spells. The normal spells last longer and usually have a
greater effect. Tis true that the Druid has to stop every so often and
renew two buffs on all party members, but the Necros can easily feed
them enough mana to make this negligible for downtime.

At level 8 I believe the Necros can still get yellow pets. Unless the
bards and rogues are twinked, the pets should still do comparable
damage.
