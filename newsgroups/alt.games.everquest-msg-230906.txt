If I thought 59 was "blink and you'll miss it" what can I call 60?

Anyway, 61 looks to be much slower, got 1% per two or 3 kills of level 
60-61 mobs where at level 60 I was getting 2-3% per kill of the same 
mobs in the same zone (CODecay)

Spell list is -looong- and I'm woefully short of getting them all so 
far.  I bought a few off bazaar folks, then bought a stack of ethereal 
parchments and ended up getting mostly spells I'd already purchased.

Spells I have:
Ward of Xenogy
Initially when I memmed this I was concerned that it wasn't a pet after 
all; its icon isn't the normal pet icon.  Turns out it mems as an air 
pet, and looks like an air pet when summoned, so this is the vaunted "61 
air pet".

I summoned this mob in COM and cleared all the way to the reavers 
without having to heal it once, to the annoyance of the raid I was with 
(they were taking their own sweet time forming up, and I figured why not 
go ahead and clear).

Then I got killed and tried to do the same thing with my 57 air pet, 
buffed to the gills by a 56 druid... and couldn't kill more than a 
couple mobs in a row, took enough healing or nuking from me that I'd 
have to come back and med up.  The difference was astonishing.

Of course the summons below might have had something to do with it too.

Belt of Magi'Kot
HP and AC belt for pets.  Handy, although I'm not sure how much 250 hp 
really matters on a pet thats got what, 4K hp?  More?  And since I don't 
have a CHeal, really its not a heal multiplier, just a buffer.

Summon: Blade of Wrulan
This is the big boy toy; 3 damage bonus (this adds to pet damage output, 
unlike normal damage which only applies if its actually higher than 
pets' damage output), plus a proc that affects all mobs instead of just 
summoned ones.  There are a couple higher level versions of this; fist 
of ixiblat and blade of the kedge, they look to me about the same 
though, other than situationally based on resists (and appearance of course)



Summon: Runed Mantle
Upgrade of the mantle series, good till level 65.  Great item, amazing 
how many KEI casting chanters don't have something as good as the silk 
mantle... but dissapointing here, the thing has AC 9 HP 20 and Mana 20; 
the other spells in the line upgraded all three of those stats each 
time, why didn't this one?  At any rate, Silken Mantle was the item I 
force on the most party members over my time 50-60

Summon: Sapphire Bracelet
Upgrade to DD bracelet line.  Sadly, line doesn't seem to be as good as 
Improved Damage, but its a boost, and having this means I can use 61+ 
spells without having to think about the fact that they aren't boosted 
but the 60- ones are.  This is the most requested item line from 30-60, 
I bet it sees plenty of use from less well geared low 60s too.

Sheild of the Aracane
Upgrade to the self HP and MR buff line, which conflicts with Focus (but 
not IOS or stamina)  30MR, 298 hp, not too bad.

Elemental Barrier
Upgrade to Fire and Cold self only resist line, seems to stack with all 
other resist buffs.  High resists really start to matter as you get up 
in levels and end up doing more raid type targets, so this is a nice 
step up.

Firebolt of Tallon
This is the storebought spell, it lists as a 1580-2000 damage spell, and 
is clearly a fire based bolt.  At 500 mana, its big and clunky, and the 
range of effect is annoying although its not really all that wide. 
Average damage should be 1790, with average effect from bracelet 1969, 
specialized to 50 (its evoc, I'm a conjure mage) is 487.5, so thats a 
4.03 average damage per mana, with no special flame based bonus, not bad 
at all except for the annoying bolt thing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SPELLS I DON'T HAVE YET
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Flameshield of Ro.  Group DS and FR, 45 points.  So Aegis of Ro was only 
good for ONE level.  And further, Aegis of Ro cost 450 mana, while this 
one costs 190 mana.  Thats cheaper than single target casting Cadeau of 
Flame on MT plus my pet.  Whats to complain?  Its a group spell, which 
means I can't cast it on my pet at all, so its no good for soloing and 
its not helpful when pet is off tanking.  I'm going to have to set up a 
swap spell list with Cadeau in it if there's a lot of off tanking going on.

Summon Glowing Bauble.  This is the Mana Preservation line.  I need this 
one, clearly, as there are so many useful 61+ spells.

Summon Platinum Choker.  This is the reagent saving line.  I wouldn't 
pay 20pp for this spell.  10% chance of a savings?   No cleric has ever 
asked me for one, and I'm not going to bother with it for the chance of 
saving a malachite or a pearl.

Summon Spiked Ring.  Spell Haste upgrade.  Need this one too, faster is 
better, and the lower items in this line were often requested.

Summon Steel Bracelet.  Burning Affliction upgrade.  Not too exciting. 
I flirted with my DOTs a while and decided I was better off focussing on 
something else.  Other people rarely ask for this; in groups you don't 
see DOTs used very often anyway, due to short mob lifespans or worries 
about unmezable adds requiring a switch in targets which DOTs will prevent.

So there we go, pretty nice level.  Hope so because it looks like I'll 
be here a while!

Splendid One, 61 Arch Gnomage, Firiona Vie

ps out of 8 parchment hand ins I got ONE level 62 spell, Burnout V.  Bad 
luck, or am I literally going to end up going thru hundreds of 
parchments to get the full set next level?
