I can tell pet classes and casters are going to have lots of fun meleeing 
in the arena there. :)

I suspect that either (a), the population in the bazaar will decrease 
somewhat, as people finally sell off the built up junk in their bank and 
the novelty wears off, or (b) Verant will take steps to deal with uberlag 
there, like dividing the arena off into a separate zone. Or both.
