Checked out the quest details at www.eqtraders.com/quests  Seems you did 
the right thing.  You may have to get a GM to get your stuff back.  Are 
you absolutely sure you gave it to Fehril?  If you are then he is bugged 
and you will be given your stuff back.  Petition this right away, and 
don't do anything until you get an answer from a GM about it.
