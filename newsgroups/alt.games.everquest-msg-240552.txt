That's a tough question. It is a RP server, so the players are right
to defend their town. However it is also a Blue server, so there isn't
any way that they can actually do that without calling in the guards.

Honestly I don't know if I'd do the same thing if I found some Dark
Elves camping in the entry to Halas, on the other side of the water
from the guards. I think if they were a comparable level, I'd duel
them (with the full support of whatever northmen were around to aid
me), but otherwise I think I can agree with some newbies trying to
train guards on them.

However, Halas has to be one of the safest places to do a mini raid.
The guards all spawn on the other side of the water. So if your puller
has Lev, you can pull the guards without the newbies being able to
train guards on you. (They'd be killed in the water before they ever
got in range of you.) A 14th level shaman with Lev and SoW, would be
able to though. I think the best way to do it, in any town is find
some inaccessible spot you can only get to with Lev, such as the top
of a large building or top of a cliff wall, and pull from there with
ranged weapons and/or spells. The newbs with Lev can still try to
train you, but would likely be killed trying to get to your location.

But then, what do I know? I'm currently playing my highest level
character ever. I finally got a character higher than 25th level
before becoming fed up with the game.
