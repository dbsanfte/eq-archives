One word...Ungratefulness. 

One thing is showing support by flag waving and sending "we're sorry
for your loss" to the President after 9-11. But it's another thing to
step up to the plate and prove your support when said President calls
you out on your word.
And whats this shit I hear on the news that France wants to be part of
the rebuilding of Iraq??
What fucken nerve...You tell the US to fuck off and we won't support
you , then you demand to get a piece of the pie after the fighting
that you didn't even have the balls to help out in.

And you have to ask " Why the hatred?". 

And it took a two Americans by the name of  Dick and Mac Mcdonald to
get the french fry right.
