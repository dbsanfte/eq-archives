I have always wanted to do that, but have never had a port capable
character and so refrained.  If I stick with my Druid on FV long
enough I will take great pleasure in /shouting:
"wtf does paying well mean?  name an amount, then we can talk"
or:
"i'm not a charity, i don't accept donations, but if you want to pay
for a port say how much"

I always figured the reason that "paying well" and "will donate" so
often keep spamming the zone for long periods of time is that any
porter who bothers to check how much they're really offering blows
them off when they find out how little it is.  Those who actually are
paying well and mention the amount rarely seem to have to shout/ooc/auc
more than once to get their ride.
