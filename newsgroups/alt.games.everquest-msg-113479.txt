I'm not happy with the idea of killing Wyverns while at the same time 
trying to ingratiate msyelf to their elders. 51 will go fast enough 
(meaning, a week or two more >:( ) in Eastern Wastes. After that, yeah, 
I'll probaby give Dreadlands a try, although after spending 20-35 in 
LOIO, my reserves of patience for idiots have run low. I think I will 
still be able to find scattered blues at 52, easily enough. 53, though, 
that kind of scares me. Sperm in Skyfire, perhaps?
