A little birdie told me VI and Telewest were in discussions about the
possibility of hosting a Europe-based server. Take that with a pinch of
salt, mind - I don't know the guy from Adam, just someone in chat who
claimed to be a beta tester for Blueyonder's online gaming servers.

I'm not sure that Telewest hosting anything would be any less laggy than
going the extra 20 hops to the US, but still.

Maybe if we all fill in a /feedback...
