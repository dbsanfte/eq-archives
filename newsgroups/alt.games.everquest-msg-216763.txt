From the shadows, the mysterious Lokari <lokari@_nospam_lokari.net>

If I saw this post in a vacuum without knowing who the poster is, I
would have said that the people invited smelled a problem *after* they
joined, which would have nothing to do with you being a druid
(presumably they would have figured that part out before joining) but
rather something in the pre-dungeon chatter.

If I'm getting bad vibes from a group, I don't have a problem cutting
things off early (in ldon groups, before going into the dungeon at
least, I wouldn't bail on a group already inside one unless things
were way out of hand).

Its quite possible it had nothing to do with you of course.
