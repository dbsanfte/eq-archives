Hear hear!  You'll note that I play a ranger James, so I know of what
I speak..but I also understand class balancing...SKs are arguably the
second best tank class in the game (see the current thread on that
very subject), so therefore, giving SKs more powerful pets and dots
runs the risk of making Necros redundant.  Think of your pet and your
dot spells as just one more tool with which to punish your enemy..in
your case, your melee abilities are your forte, but you can also
unleash a baby pet on them and dump a few dots on them.  I'm happy
with the current line up of ranger spell abilities, and SKs don't
strike me as being any worse off.
