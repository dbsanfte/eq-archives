No, I don't think that you can.   The second you add an augment to an item,
the item becomes no-drop.    (At least that is the way it works on the main
servers, and I dont' see why FV would be different, since augments are still
no-drop there.)

You must remove the augment from the item before the item becomes droppable
again.

As a side note, has anyone removed an augment yet?    Does it destroy the
augment, or do you get the gem back?
