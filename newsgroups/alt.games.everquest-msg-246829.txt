EQ is like watching a movie on an old projector. The projectionist has 
run out of reels and is now franticly making shadow puppets on the 
screen to keep the audience in their seats.

It used to be worth the effort for the glory of taking down the first 
dragons or gods or standing around a newbie zone with your epic 
equipped, but does anyone care what the high end guilds do in the latest 
two or three expansions? Being the first in WoW certainly sounds more 
appealing than taking down the latest tacked on raid encounter in EQ.
