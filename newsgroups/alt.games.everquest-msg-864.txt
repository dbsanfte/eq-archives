hehe the fact that you can only give the account to you child if they are
under 13 or somesuch . .and your multiple children can't share, have to buy
them each one. Maybe not overly strict, they have "reasons"  but I find it
funny

"You may not transfer or share your Account with anyone, except that if you
are a parent or guardian, you may permit one child to use the Account
instead of you (in which case you may not use that Account)."
