I would like to see a reality server created.
Characters could sign up to be moved there after lvl 20 for it would be a very
difficult enviroment. A few of the things I would include are:

Total PVP! You can loot everything at any time.

Cursed Options! To account for full looting, give players the option of cursing
the items in their inventory for a price (10 percent of the item's value). If a
cursed item is looted, it hurts the thief. (XP lost, Poison, Death, Corrosive
Rust eats all their euipement etc) This will make one really think about what
they loot.

Limit what one can carry at one time! I think containers should be downgraded,
and can one really carry six large items in his hands?

Get rid of tell/shout and replace them with a skill called telepathy, and allow
yell to send sentences.

60+ Options: Once you reach lvl 60, you can complete a quest to become a zone
(area) God where you are able to control the enviroment & npc in a zone. (In
exchange for given up your character)

I think this would make a challenging enviroment for experienced players. PC
would have to develop a code of justice and work to enforce it. 

I understand why things are the way they are now, I still enjoy it (lvl 22),
but I think I may grow tired of fighting AI or the wimpy pvp rules
