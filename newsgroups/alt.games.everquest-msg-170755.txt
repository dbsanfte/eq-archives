I would like to be slowed as little as possible but lately I have taken to
hunting in an area teeming with shamans. I am under the impression that
slows are disease based. So is there a theoretical "never get slowed" amount
of disease resist I should go for? Would I need disease and magic resist? I
heard a rumor once that if I got my disease resist to 140 I wouldn't be
slowed and although I am close I still get slowed. If I reach this mythical
140 disease resist will I be unslowable? Currently I'm dual boxing a cleric
and a ranger so I can just case cure/counteract disease a few times to get
rid of it but many times the shamans just refresh the slow only moments
after I cured it. I am thinking about getting the "clean disease right click
earring" just to save a spell slot but I'd still have to cast it a few times
and then the shammies could just cast it again on me. =(
Any advice or results from anyone that's had this problem or been through
this before?
