How many starting cities? 15?  That's 15 x Y quests where Y is the 
number they feel worthwhile getting you from level 1 to level 20 say.

As opposed to 1 x Y for one new starting location.

Economics, resourcing, etc.

Plus, if you have 100 new players and they all start in the same place, 
you increase the chances of keeping those players in the game, vs. 
starting them all in different places.  When you had 10000 new players 
you *needed* to keep them apart, now you *need* to keep them together.
