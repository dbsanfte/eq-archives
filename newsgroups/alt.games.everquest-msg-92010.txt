Acrylia armor is player made.  It requires some smithing skill to make the
boning from Acrylia ore, and tailoring skill to then make the reinforced
armor from some Flawless Rockhopper Hides and the Acrylia boning, and some
purchased ingredients.  The Acrylia ore drops in Tenebrous Mountains off of
Grimlings and Aliens that I know of, probably drops elsewhere as well.

Visit www.lokari.net for all sorts of information on tailoring.
