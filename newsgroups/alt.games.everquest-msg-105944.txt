Well i can see that this might make the game better but let's be reasonable
also.  Just because you have a fungi (which I don't) tunic, doesn't mean you
are a "experience whore", "selfish", "inconsiderate" person.  In fact from a
personal example, there was a rogue that was solo'ing in the sarnak fort
that asked if another person would like to group with him while he killed
things that were red to him.  Just because he knew that the armor he had
made him more powerful and he wanted to share the experience with someone
else.  I thought it was nice and I don't think he was being selfish or had
some twisted plot when doing this.  However, I think level restrictions are
a good thing and I think it will change the game a bit but not kill the
game.
