I suppose i should take your method, but I am tired of being
expected to read their mind.  I had some guy i timed the
other day, two minutes before he finally asked me for sow. 
Personally just walking up and standing there to me is ruder
than Sow me plz.  These idiots that expect you to be their
personal buff service, as they feel it is their right, have
gotten so lazy they can even bother with d00d sow now plz!
(And yes I have actually gotten that as a reqest for sow, I
happened to be fighting and told him just a sec to his first
question of I need a sow)

I do drive by SoW all the time. If i am in freeport or
something and see someone naked, especially a race non
native to the area, like barbarians, dwarves, erudites, they
get a sow before they can even ask.  CR sucks, and i am glad
to help anyone I can with them.  But when i am in a group or
out solo fighting somewhere, a little common courtesy of
asking is nice to hear.
