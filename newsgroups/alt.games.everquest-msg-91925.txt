Nah - biggest overcon is Lino Jinglebelly in Befallen - has like 1 hitpoint,
even if he was level 1 that was an overcon...

The Herald Telcha in Chardok comes to mind....
I have no idea what level he cons, as he is green
to me at 51, but he is permarooted, has about 800hp,
a crappy regen and does not fight back.
Anyone know wether you can actually get xp/loot off him?
Would be an option to level a lowbie char on - stand a melee
class in front of him, attack on and go afk til dead,
rinse and repeat. Just hope you don't get trained.
