Aye, I do that too.  As I say, its not unworkable by any means.

However, last night I went in and clicked Find Trader, got a barely 
visible trail of yellowish dots on the floor which lead me right to my 
target.

Then I tried it again and got a message telling me that for some reason 
it couldn't show me the way!

Too tired to really play with it any more, I set up trader mode and 
logged out, but if it works only 50% of the time I'm not going to bother.
