Yes sadly its that time again ... Nurga just isnt cutting it anymore so its
time for me to ask the group where can I hunt next ?

I'm playing a 44 Troll Beastlord, I've been in the mines of Nurga for the
last few levels and am planning to stay there until 45 ( the exps slowing
down, but the loots still worth it).

But where can I go next ?, everyone keeps suggesting DL, so I popped along
and gave it a try with a good group, even with chain pulling 1 - 2 mobs a
time its was sloooooow, and so boring, why do people hunt here ? the loots
very poor and the exps not much better =(

Solo'ing in the DL is very do-able but its just not a zone I enjoy, reminds
me too much of OT (another place I just cant understand the appeal of).

But anyway Like I said I'm going to be 45, with low to average gear
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=481920 and totally stumped, I
do prefer to solo in fact other than guild events, joining that group in the
DL was the first time I have grouped since about 24 or so =) and would
really love to get to 49 to get my groovy new pet.

Thankyou in advance for any help you can offer.
