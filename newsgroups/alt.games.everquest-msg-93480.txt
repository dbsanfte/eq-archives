No one ever said that or even implied it. You're being rather
ridiculous with this statement. I only made mention of my being a RPer
as a frame of referrence.

Not in the slightest. I know plenty of 40+ year olds who act
pre-pubescent, and d00d speak knows no age barriers.

A cartoon character is a figure in several hand drawn images displayed
in rapid procession to grant the illusion of movement. EQ characters
don't fit this description. "Toon" generally refers to chartoon
characters that are of a comic nature.

While I myself have only been playing 2 years, several of my guildies
have been playing since beta. All of those guildies have the same
distaste for the term, and all of them only hear it from a small
percentage of people, usually accompanied by liberal use of things
like "u" and "ne 1" and "plz".

I have to wonder where you got the version of EQ where the characters
were NOT computer-generated images...
