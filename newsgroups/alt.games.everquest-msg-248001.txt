It really shouldn't have made a damn bit of difference what client the
server was talking to. The servers in both cases are talking to the
client mostly with IP, internet protocol, a standard communication
protocol, using UDP, a layer on top of IP. It was a really dumb choice
on SOE's part to ghetto mac users on their own servers and it looks like
it bit them in the ass. Maybe they thought more Mac users would sign up
if there was a fresh start for them, but I'm betting they lost a ton of
people who didn't have a PC too when they found out they couldn't play
with their PC using friends.

The treatment the Mac users are getting isn't really too surprising,
considering the way SOE has been running lately either.
