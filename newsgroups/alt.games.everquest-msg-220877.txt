Well after some time off and playing swg I am about to reactivate my
account.  I quit right after I bought LoY, so never got to visit any of
those zones.  I will probably buy LDoN too.  Some questions though:

1.  How do I get to the new LoY zones?

2.  What are some good places for my 55 Monk, 54 Cleric, 51 Druid to get a
decent group/solo?

3.  Any more info on the LDoN "missions" I've been hearing about?

Thanks!
