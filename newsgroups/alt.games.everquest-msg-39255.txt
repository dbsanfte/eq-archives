You ought to be worried. Three months ago, PC Gamer magazine listed
this problem as a factor that would ruin the larger game, the fact
they didn't respond to you tells me nothing has been done to rectify
that problem. One more reason to avoid this game, not to mention the
effect cheating, macros, third party software has on any PvP game be
it quake or one of these massive multi-player role playing games.
