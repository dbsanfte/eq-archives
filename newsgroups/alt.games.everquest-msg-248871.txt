Are you trying to say that Daddys boy Bush is intelligent and well educated?
Lol.
Does the largest deficit in your countries history bother you in the
slightest? Your country is hocked. Now that is not funny. In fact the two
largest deficits were done by Bush Snr and Bush Jnr.

So why does it not apparently bother you that America's shit list has
nothing to do with human dignity. The shit list has everything to do with
money and power. Nothing to do with people. Just look at who they installed
in Afganistan. Or for that matter in Chile when they killed the elected
president. Surley you cant be so miopic as to not care what the shit list is
for.

Oh, why do you say that America's military is good at "minimum collateral
dammage? Man you must really shut your eyes, close your mouth and cover your
ears. Does the word "cluster bomb" have any meaning to you. Face it. This is
not the "good guys" versus the "bad guys". This is the bad guys versus the
bad guys.

I really destest the treatment untried prisoners recieve at the hands of
sick fuckups.

No, actually they are not guarding terrorists in the main, they are guarding
ex service men.

Actually that was also the Australian, British SAS and American special

Now remind me. Which country kills most of its citizens each year per
capita? Is that America? oops.

Most of the world does not kill its own people for crimes, or other people,
or torture them, so your "restraint" is quite underwhelming. In any event,
it is quite wrong to suggest that they "were not tortured" That is a matter
of uncontroversial public record in the US.
