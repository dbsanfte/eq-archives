Yeah, two more slots so they never have to wait for me to re-mem AQ again so
I can haste their butts on the fly. ;)  And hey, I see just as many 18+
whiners as <18 whiners.

10 spell slots would be awesome.  I'd actually love more, but even this
would be an improvement.  And maybe while they're at it, they'll make it so
we can TURN OFF TREE TEXTURES, DAGNABBIT!!  Give me big opaque, non-moving,
solid-textured blotches, that's fine, but the movement KILLS my framerate
(and I can't afford to upgrade right now).    Grarr!
