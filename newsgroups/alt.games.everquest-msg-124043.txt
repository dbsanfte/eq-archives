I value being able to channel things like snares more quickly - the
haste on affliction specific stuff is significant. GSD isnt appalling,
its not *good* statswise, but the focus is, and frankly at this level
when you're talking about FBR's, etc, *none* of the robes stats are
going to make a significant difference. 6INT vs 5INT 20 mana and an
extra 4ac? Whoop.

Faster casting DOTS (including the snare lines)? WHOOP.

Just my opinion of course.

If you look at the magelo profile I referenced you'll see some of the
robes my necro has (I like to dress up ;) ) ... I pretty much exclusively
use the green silken drape when in combat and the rest are for "looking
pretty".
