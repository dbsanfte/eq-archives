Well, for my best ever xp group, there is no way in hell I would trade a 
warrior in for a Paladin.  Courtyard in BoT, all level 65, shaman (me), 
Paladin, Ranger (bard for a while too), Monk, Monk, Monk.  Without the 
paladin tossing in his heals as well, we would not have been able to go 
nonstop, with it, I was able to slow the mobs, keep the paladin healed, 
with his help, and keep my mana at a reasonable level.

Yep, and I would have substituted a ranger or rogue in for any of the 
monks in the above group too.

If they made a warrior hold aggro equally as well as a knight class, and 
had the warrior have a small advantage in damage taking ability, I would 
think that any of the 3 classes would then be equally desirable.  A 
paladin may take a bit more damage, but, he can heal himself and the 
group to counterbalance that, as well as rez (I take 90% happilly if that 
is what is available), and stun.  The SK can heal himself some, as well 
as bring snare, corpse summoning, nice attack debuff/buff to the table.
