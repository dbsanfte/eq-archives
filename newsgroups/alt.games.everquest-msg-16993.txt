Hi, Chris.
  I'm sure I'll be corrected if I'm wrong, but I believe that the
various words, runes, tokens, and other research items drop randomly off
a wide variety of mobs that are appropriate to the level of the spell
being researched. I've gotten words and runes of wildly varying types
from different mobs all over Norrath. The higher level I get, the more I
see the less common research components off of the bigger mobs.
  That being said, I *seem* to recall getting a lot of them to drop off
of gargoyles and pickclaw goblins. But that may just be because I ganked
so many of them. As to specific "this mob drops this component", no. I
don't think there is such a list or correlation.
