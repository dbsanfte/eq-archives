I'd be very careful about mentioning "Flowers Of Happiness" and "PvP
Roleplay" in the same sentence, paragraph, or post..


They make it sound really cute and funny on their website. They're a motley
crew of hardy morons with a decent collective sense of humor. But trust
me....there was absolutely no roleplaying during the whole "Swamp Defense"
episode on Rallos, and far, far less by Mr. Fansy The Famous Bard(who,
incidentally, was played by everyone's favorite MYTHIC EMPLOYEE, "Lum The
Mad").

FOH is out only to kill, loot, and generally cause trouble. Not that that's
a big problem, but let's call them what they are.
