From yesturday's patch:

"...You should also look for changes in that evolving zone of Nedaria's
Landing.  I wonder what is going on there?
- An update to the zone, Nedaria's Landing.  Make sure you check it out..."

Don't bother going to look.
The only thing changed is that the Boat and some NPCs are gone.
Ooooooooo Whoopty-de-fucking-do!
