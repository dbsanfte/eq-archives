30,35,40, and 45 did *nothing* to slow down people from getting 60.
The levels that did that are 51+, and especially 54 and 59 which are
so painful they can cause people to quit forever. Or were last time I
went through them both, which was before velks was changed.

Those levels aren't going to be changed.
