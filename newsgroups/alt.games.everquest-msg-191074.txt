Was watching CNN today and they showed how fu**en stupid some people
can be.
It seems a couple of french protesters went up to the Normandy
Memorial  during the night and wrote "Roastbeef go home" on it ,
Roastbeef is what they calll the Brits. As well as writing other" Fu**
the US" comments but I love they way the put a Swastia up there too.

Just fu**en ignorant, but the thing is the local news didn't mention a
thing about. I guess they don't want all those WW2 vets beating the
shit out of french punks.
