Yeah - take a month or two off from EQ. Don't play it at all. Then,
come back and try it again, and see if you find it fun again or not.

If you're still bored with it, close your account and find something
else to play or do.

The point of EQ is to have a good time, and it's no surprise that
after two years you'd be getting bored. Nothing wrong with that - it
might simply be time to move on.
