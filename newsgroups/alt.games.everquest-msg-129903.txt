Indeed they were, just as the people kidnapped by the British
from American ships in the early 1800s were American.  Just
as the civilians murdered by the British during their invasion
in the War of 1812 were American.  Just as the inhabitants
of Washington, DC were American -- murdered and rendered
homeless by the British.

But, it seems, time passes, and relationships change. 

The destruction of the Liberty and the murder of its crew
were horrible things.  The tactical reasons for doing it
were comprehensible.  Whether or not the US, UK, USSR, Egypt,
Syria, or anybody else would do the same thing under the same
circumstances is a fun question to debate.  Every country
that has been in a war has done something along this line.


Whether or not a single event like that should dictate all
further interactions with another country in perpetuity
is a different question.  Frankly, there comes a time when
one can realize that current relationships need not be
dictated by past ones.  That's why it was possible for
the US to have a Southern President -- the War Between
the States is over.

Should the past be considered?  Certainly.  Should the past
have influence?  Certainly.  Should the past dictate?  No.
