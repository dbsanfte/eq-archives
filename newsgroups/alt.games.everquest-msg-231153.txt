Had the same thing happen in Karana.  Had a HG rooted and DOT'd standing in
the middle of the road with my character seated medding in front of it.
Another high level comes up and starts smacking it so I go into the "HEY!
Knock it off mode!" He still killed it but must of finally looked at his
journal and said he was sorry. I let it go since it was an honest mistake.

In almost 4 years of play I have never been ks by a druid. I have been ks by
just about every other character in the game including bards, rogues,
magicians, you name it.

My take on the situation is lots of people wanted to be an asshole right
from the start but druids what with SoW, DOTs, fast leveling,and DD were
just the most capable. Now that everyone has a level 63 sumtin, they can let
their true nature out.
