Yeah - we can dish out a reasonable amount of damage when we get to around
level 20, what with kick, dual wield and double attack, but we die quite
quickly if we get forced to act as main tank. The ability for criticals with
ranged weapons might be handy in certain circumstances, but a decent bow and
arrows can be expensive.
We get some handy spells, like healing - nowhere near as good as druids or
pallies though (don't even have to mention clerics). Can do a bit of crowd
control with snare, root and harmony, but not as effective as druids or
chanters.

A question for other people - how good are necros at that? I know they can
cast fear and darkness, but can they do anything about aggro ranges of a
group of mobs?
