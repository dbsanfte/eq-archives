> your thoughts please ;-)

If there's no one around, loot it.

Otherwise, ask if they're going to loot it, and if they wouldn't mind you
doing it.  Lots of times people are just trying to get their latest alt up
in levels and don't care about looting that moss snake because they know
it's worth maybe a silver (or gold, or plat, depending on level), so they
leave the corpses to rot.

But you should never ASSUME that's what they're doing.
