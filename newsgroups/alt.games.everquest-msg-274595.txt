The town was named apparently back in the early 1800s.  As I recall, they
had a referendum on it a few years back.  The decision was to keep the name.

Some sites:

http://www.staynewfoundland.ca/dildo_27417.php
http://collections.ic.gc.ca/baccalieutrail/archdildoisland.htm

The second one, if you follow the "communities" link, will give you a list.
Follow "Dildo" from there and you can see some heritage buildings and a
timeline of the town.
