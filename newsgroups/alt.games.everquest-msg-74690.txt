you can get EQ in various forms, I'd say get the new trilogy (EQ and the 3
expansions: Kunark, Velious and Luclin). I bought it from www.gameplay.com
(that's UK despite being .com). You could try www.amazon.co.uk and
www.softwarefirst.co.uk (last one might be .com) To compare prices I swear
by www.shopsmart.com (again is for UK but has a .com). Its a very useful
site in my experience
