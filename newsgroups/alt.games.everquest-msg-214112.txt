On a side note:

Did you say 20k splat?

Hrmph! Hadn't thought much about it, but it makes sense. Some people
(warriors only?) have been able to surpass 10k HP with combos of high-end
gear and abilities. To reward the effort of using what the developers put
into the game, Complete Healing was reduced from 10k HP heal max (unheard of
when the spell was introduced) to 7500 IIRC?  It would only make sense that
they would up the damage for large falls as well. I'd always ever heard them
referred to as "10k Splats". WE can't have anyone ( albiet a very small
population of people) surviving certain death now can we? ;-)

Somehow "20k Splat" doesn't roll off the tongue as easy.
