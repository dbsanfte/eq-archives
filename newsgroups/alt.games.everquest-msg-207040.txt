No, no. I use standard English grammar rules. The cases where
apostrophes are used for plurals aren't by far the majority. In fact,
in comparison to the cases that don't use them, they are a very small
percentage and, thus, "rather uncommon".

So I left out a word. "Why do people think apostrophes are used for
*ALL* plurals?". Better? *eyeroll*
