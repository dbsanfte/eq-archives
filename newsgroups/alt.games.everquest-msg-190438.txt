Going to piggyback a little bit, so responding to two sometimes.

More importantly, if you're doing all raids and no experience, for most
people, the game will get real old, real fast.   Or at least it did for me.

This is pure bullshit.  Warrior DPS is not big, with only the two knight
classes being lower, and not in all situations.  Proc'ing weapons are *the*
way to gain and hold aggro.   I had a second set of weapons aside from my
normal one.  (Actually I had a few different sets)  Quicker, faster and more
dps than my main weapons.   I used them anytime I wanted to be sure I did
not grab aggro.

Pre-50, you might be closer to correct, but post 50, it's all about the
proc.

Aside from that, /disc defensive cuts the warriors DPS by about 60%....

You seem to be extremely stuck on this.   Understand, other than PoP, there
is no experience game past 60.  If you're not in a Planar group, you might
as well not be playing.

For a while we were taking our exp group to Cazic Thule (one of the best
non-PoP experience zones, if not the best), for a bit of a break, to farm
some nice toys, and to "powerlevel" 58'ish warrior and rogue friends.  We
would tear throught he place like you would not believe.   It was pretty
fun, but at the end of the night when you counted up how much exp had been
gained...  Well, the warrior and rogue gained 3 "regular exp" yellows, the
same as they would gain in a PoP group.  Maybe one yellow less.    For those
past 60...  I would come away having gained one AA orange for the entire
night.     If that group was in the planes, the same amount of time would
have gained one AA level, at minimum.  7 AA oranges more likely.


Snip the rest of this.
