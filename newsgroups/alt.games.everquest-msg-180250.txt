Cost does not normally directly affect price except in very low
margin businesses.  What it does is to determine the minimum price
at which the product/service makes business sense (this can be
affected by other factors as well).

But again, price setting is determined by the market (or, to be more
accurate, by the business's perception of the market), not by cost.
Cost vs. price determines whether it's a worthwhile business to be
in.
