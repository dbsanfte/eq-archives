First of all, if you end up running trains to zone a lot, or if you've never
hunted in Dawnshroud Peaks but may someday, this info could save you some
serious grief and aggravation. So read closely....

I've been hunting in Dawnshroud since lvl 34 or so. I first started out
soloing the mushrooms over near the entrance to Sanctus Seru for a couple of
spawns then LFG afterwards, until some of the shrooms turned light blue
occasionally when they popped.

I don't solo in Dawnshroud anymore, for two reasons: Wolves and
Lightcrawlers. I get jumped by those way too often, even when I'm in a
group, so soloing would be suicide.

But ever since I started grouping mostly at ME, I've been forced to zone
because of trains a lot. It seems like some people run their trains to the
ME zone if its closer than NL, but they don't have the common curtosey
(spelled wrong, I know) to announce that they're hauling a train to zone.

Someone kept running mushrooms and wolves (at the same time) to ME one day
last week, without any notice. I don't know if someone reported them or if
they just left the zone, because it stopped after about five trains.
Fortunately, we were more than able to deal with the shrooms and wolves, and
started preparing for it after the second train.

A few days ago, I was standing just inside the entranceway leading to ME,
buffing a pet I had just summoned and was forced to zone because some idiot
trained a Rockhopper there. Fortunately, I hadn't wasted mana on buffs (the
first one I was casting was interrupted when the hopper, which I wasn't
expecting, hit me). All I know is the offender was an Iksar. I didn't see
their name, and they must have either been using a racial illusion and
dropped it or camped before I zoned into ME, or would have chewed them a new
one if I had.

And on top of that, I came VERY close to dying (and a Monk in my group who
was at half hit points before zoning DID die) once night after zoning to
escape a train when someone in wolf form ran a train of Gorangas to the zone
line inside ME without warning. (I have about 613 hit points with all my
gear on and all my buffs up, but I made it out with about 10 hit points
left!). As a result, I now cast Invisibility as soon as I zone into ME (or
before I zone if I have the spell memorized and I actually have fair
warning) and keep facing inward, backing out when I return to Dawnshroud.
From what I hear, this is a good idea for zoning into GE, as well.

I wonder if SoE could make a Train!!! button that automatically adds the
name of whatever zone you're running to to the message....

Nah. Doesn't matter. Too many lazy and just plain inconsiderate morons out
there who wouldn't use it.
