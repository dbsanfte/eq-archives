Seems rather presumptuous.

Don't have a good explanation though.  I assume you did fiddle with 
height filter and zooming in and out?

It does sound like you don't have the map, as that is what Veksar looks 
like on mine, as I have not gotten around to downloading a map.  So, it 
could be the file name.  Try creating your own map with a few lines, and 
see what name it appears under.
