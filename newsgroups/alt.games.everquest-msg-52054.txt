Hell levels are specific levels, namely 30,35,40,45,and 50 - 59.
In these levels the amount of xp required is about twice as much the
previous level. Thus they take much longer. Many say that 30, 35, and 40
are non issues. Some say that 59 is the only hell level.

The levels after hell levels (31,36,41,46) are often called penalty
levels. This is due to the fact that the xp loss from dieing is based on
the amount of xp required for the *previous* level. Thus if you die in
31 you loos more xp (relitivly) than you would should you die during 32.

From my own clculations for example level 29 requires 7% more kills than
28 while 30 requires 117% more than 29. Thus if level 28 took 100 blue
kills 29 would take 107 and 30 would take about 225 kills.

HTH,

Jim

PS Is this in the FAQ ?
