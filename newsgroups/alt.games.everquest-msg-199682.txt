I am playing an Erudite shadowknight on the Firona Vie server and wanted 
to raise him up on Odus.  Then I realized that the vendors in Paineel 
were just not selling the things that I needed:  small boxes and large 
bags, spits to cook up edible goo (made from rat ears and fire beetle 
eye), sewing patterns, etc.  I had to hussle down to Neriak in no time; 
the quality difference between Neriak and Paineel is vast.  This is sad, 
because the architecture of Paineel is very very nice and that city 
could be kick-ass if that little vendor thing were taken care of.

Where do I post this at the EQLive site for the developers to read?  The 
forums seem to of changed from what I remember of them.  Not sure where 
to click on.
