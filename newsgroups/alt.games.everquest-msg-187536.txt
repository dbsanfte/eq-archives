But that's not alt-tab. That's shift-alt-r.... Alt-tab is...alt-tab.

The problem is that WinXP has coded in a list of programs that don't
react well to alt-tab. At the time the list was made, EQ was still one
of those. There's an admin tool from Microsoft you can download to
edit that list, which is what solved the problem for me. The link to
it and instructions are in the news archives at eq.castersrealm.com.
Don't recall the date, sometime in January. I think it was the day
after SOE finally added in alt-tab support for EQ.
