Visually hiding it.  Not the same thing really.  And fewer and fewer druids
seem to bother with wolf form anymore anyway.

I'm working on a set of Blazing armor... and I even wear it whenever
confronting a cleric epic mob.  Fire resist on it is great, but other than
that the stuff is unwearable except for its look.

On the other hand, my "real" gear includes things like a Donals BP, Donals
Boots, Thurg legs... things few 61 clerics would be caught dead in, that I
wear because they let me use strategies that people with better stats on
their gear can't hope to; they are tools that allow different approaches to a
problem.

19 I suppose.  Lets say Cookie Cutter Battlecleric, then.  Every battlecleric
I've seen is using a summoned hammer.  There are rumors that something called
Black Star might be useful... but I haven't seen anyone with one.  There are
no strategic considerations, no tactical considerations, no variation in what
the melee cleric has managed to procure (except the subtle one of proc rate)
no diety based or race based differences... the hammer is so much better than
anything else that its the only possible plan.

Yes, the performance increase specifically of the proc.  This was put in
directly as a balancing issue for clerics; a high proc rate irrisistable
damage proc that doesn't generate much aggro; this is the rough equivalent of
double attack, just with a different look to it.  Tying the proc to a
specific weapon, as opposed to making it a self only "call of" or "sword
dancing" style buff, means that this upgrade is inherantly limiting clerics
to using that one weapon, or trudging along in the same wimpy combat state
that we were in before the upgrade.

Weilding weapon X when the fight is over is a cosmetic solution, similar to
putting on my Blazing for parties, or your worrying about wolf form covering
your neato gear while you fight.  Where once someone may have looked at my
Righteousness and said "hey, whats that, wow look at the little cleric GO"
they now would look at the same weapon  and say "Geeze, what are you doing
with that piece of gimp?  Forget to summon the hammer?"... except that they
wouldn't even do that, as it happens to look the same as the Hammer of
series.

I'd replace it occaisionally for a more mana weapon... in fact I do, when I'm
in a "melee isn't going to be a factor" situation, I carry my epic.  Making
me the same as pretty much every other cleric; we all have our epics, and we
all use the hammer to hit things with.  I'd replace it much more often for a
FT weapon.. but you'd have to work hard to convince me to actually fight
anything with a weapon that doesn't proc Hand of God with the current high
proc rates of the hammer series.  The hammer itself is nothing special,
decent, yes, but frankly I have several better weapons to use unless facing
undead.  Its the proc, and the proc alone, that "fixed" cleric melee.  Tying
the proc to the weapon means that using the weapon is the only option.

At least now you've put substance behind your comment, this was an
'Either/Or' choice, and you've gone with the explanation instead of the "just
bitchin" pick.
