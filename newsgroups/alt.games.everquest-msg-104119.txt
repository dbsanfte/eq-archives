Happens a lot but I just assumed that I hadn't hit enter or "r".

Incidentally, on FV where I usually have to repeat everything because no-one
else understands my halfling or pidgin-human, if I do a fast repetitive
shift-uparrow-enter to repeat the previous message, in the usually forlorn
hope that the recipient will understand what I am babbling about, it only
works two out of three times, probably because of some buffering technique I
guess.
