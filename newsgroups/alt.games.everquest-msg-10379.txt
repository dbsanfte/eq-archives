In above post I made metion of a War, I've been told *have yet to confirm*
that some of the main NPC are using illusion spells to mask there ture
"colors" any dark race NPC using an illusion of a light race should be
killed, looted and documented on the spot.... the war is at hand, let the
light perice the darkness... Bertoxxulous will not take our land with out
first the blood of his follows running like the water in our fair rivers and
steams!

Supplier's Head & Sealed Note - dropped by a dark elf that spawns in a tower
near Permafrost in Everfrost.
.........
No idea. I got the same items off a dark elf enchanter that was using the
Erudite illusion in Qeynos Hills hear the lake where Hadden spawns.
