What precisely would you like to know?

GMs can perform the ceremony if you petition a week in advance (or more)
and again an hour before the ceremony. They will need to know your name,
deity and class, and that of your fiance, if they need to provide vows
or if you will provide, how religious you want the ceremony, if a
surname change needs to occur (and to what for whom), if they should
provide refreshments, and when & where the ceremony takes place. The
religiousness of the ceremony is needed so that a high elf Tunare cleric
doesn't show up to perform the ceremony between a dark elf and a troll.
Or, you can provide all of that, and just request your surname change to
happen at the ceremony.

hope this helps
