My, what an odd position to take....

If you're trying to go for "SoW is a spell you get a level 14, therefore
nobody below 14 should need it", I'd point out that Shaman get it at 9, and
someone as low as level 6 can group with a level 9 quite easily...

If you're saying it's not helpful at that level...  well, I died more than
once between level 6 and 14, hunting in West and then North Karana, where I
would have survived if I could have run from whatever was killing me.


If you're going to classify it as begging, at least be consistant and classify
it as begging for all.   ;)
