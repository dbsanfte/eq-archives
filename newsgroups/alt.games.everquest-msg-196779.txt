For the most part twinked better than my main, a shaman.  But I expected
that from your description.  I'm pretty broke.  I have higher WIS gear, but
that's what I concentrated on, where as you concentrated on HP.  Where you
really have me beat is the Iksar BP and the Chitin handwraps.

From my perspective pretty well twinked, but probably medium compared to
some.

Get a JBB and you will be a soloing GOD and probably hit 56 before I do. :)
