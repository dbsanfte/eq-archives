are you sure?, 
 I could of sworn that while soloing with my beastlord and I use my
big pet heal (something like 1600 HP) I have gained aggro from the pet
when mob was not next to me.... mob left pet and came right for me
when heal landed... 
 Id say it doesnt happen alot, but it has happened to me on several
occasions.    There is always the chance that the DoT that I had on
the mob, out aggroed the pet at the same time I cast... but again this
would have to occure on several different occasions.
