I decided to go out and look on the net, to see what strategies others feel 
are important for necros. On one site, a high lvl necro posted this:

"Covetous Subversion: You have mana--fill up the others who don't. Most 
critical is your Cleric, then your other casters. You can get your Cleric 
out of a mana-low and give your other casters a needed boost when everyone 
else is full or just alot higher. Always let people know when you are 
approaching FM so they know you have mana to give. I usually swap out 
Augment Death with Covetous Subversion as needed."

IMO, Necros who are free with their mana are a cleric's best friend. I don't 
care how you "manage your mana" you will get low from time to time. If you 
say you don't, you lie. I am a lvl 59 cleric and without a necro I do pretty 
darn good with a few meds... but why waste time on meds when you have a 
necro that can cure that? I just don't get it. Why act like you are imposing 
on the poor necro... when all the cleric DOES is save others. We are a very 
"giving" class. Yet necros don't feel they deserve anything in return for 
keeping their hineys alive?? I just don't get it...
