Sorry if this is the wrong group for this question, but I really need help.        
I can't open my map in some zones.  I thought it was because my sense 
heading was too low, but my buddy can open his maps everywhere and I'm 
higher.  Is there a setting I can check or change?  Is it character 
sensitive?  TIA..
