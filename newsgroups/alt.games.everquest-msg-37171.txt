Actually, guides aren't invulnerable. They are non-aggro to
everything, though. And have insta-ports, so there's no real reason
for them to die. They aren't allowed to engage in combat with mobs
except under specific conditions, usually using an insta-kill command
instead when needed, which leaves no corpse behind.

Apprentice guides really have it rough. No free account, no nifty
gear, just a clickstick that insta-gates them to their bind point.
They don't even have all the commands that full guides have. Gotta
earn all that. Guides also aren't allowed to loot or buy/sell gear
except when specificly investigating a problem. The only gear a guide
may have onhand are the tools given to them for their job. So, the
naked guys with a staff and a green name are always apprentices. ;-)
