I think so.  I had noticed that the vendors seemed to be empty after
I'd buy out  a vendor's stock of a particular item, but I chalked that
up to the server not being up for very long.  But come to think of it,
I was seeing that on every NPC trader that had all 80 slots filled,
which is way too much of a coincidence.

I'm not sure if the nerf was intentional.

I've also noticed a bug recently when buying something off both a PC
and NPC trader where I get the item I bought, but it still shows up in
the trader's slots, but the names are mixed up on the items.  Getting
out and back into the trader dialog with that trader clears it up, but
it's a bug nonetheless.

And there was another bug that would cause me to crash to the desktop
after completing a transaction with an NPC or PC trader... once in a
while.  Fortunately, I never lost anything, but crashing out is not
fun.  Error 1018.. grr.
