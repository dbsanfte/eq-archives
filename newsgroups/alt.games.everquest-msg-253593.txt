OMG in GMT (where I am) that's from 12pm-8pm, then we add another 3hours for
computer work time and I can't even start playing until 11pm. I have guild
things though so it just so happens I will be staying up really late.
I just think that an 8hour patch is a little excesive, not complainin or
anything just saying that that wipes out a whole day for some peeps.
