Doesn't seem to match what I've seen, which is far more SK than 
warriors, although admittedly the Paladin thing does fall in line as 
less popular than either..

I've also seen far fewer druids than shaman, but it could simply be thta 
the druids are all off soloing somewhere.

Other than this, the numbers are more or less in line with my observations.
