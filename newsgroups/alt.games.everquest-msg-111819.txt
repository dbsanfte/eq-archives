1) We are talking about an old engine. Maybe now they could create the
ability to do this if starting from the ground up. We'll see what they do
with EQ2.

2) Just because the game doesn't support dynamic objects doesn't mean that
VI isn't making full ue of inheritance. It's possible that the class for the
fine steel dyed plate is inherited from the fine steel plate class and each
color plate is inherited from the dyed plate class. Of course, it's also
possible that VI didn't even use an object oriented design model, which
would explain a lot of the problems they have with emergency patches after
every big patch. Just because you use an OOP language (we don't even know if
Verant used OO programming) doesn't necessarily mean that your program is
going to be easier to write and have less bugs, you need to begin the design
process using object oriented techniques.
