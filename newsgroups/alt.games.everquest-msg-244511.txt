You cannot know how bad an idea this is. Most the bugs that are found
are found when testing is not being officially done. Like 99% of them.
None of which would be caught in your scenario.

What test needs is enough people dedicated to playing on it regularly
to catch as much as they can. Which is how it has worked for quite a
while, but the population is geetting shaky.
