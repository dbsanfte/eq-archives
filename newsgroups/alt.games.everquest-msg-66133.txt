I don't know if they had much of a choice when it came to picking the API.
I guess they could have gone with OpenGL, although I don't know how common
that one is these days.  The point is, they chose to use DirectX.  Not
entirely a bad choice, except that the company that publishes and maintains
the API makes it nearly impossible to get older versions once they've
published a new release.  So if someone wants to get DirectX from
Microsoft's site, they pretty much have to get the most recent release
available.  It the situation was such that MS kept the newest one, along
with a release or two back (8.1, 7.1 and 6, for example) in public
circulation, I would imagine companies using that particular API would have
a much easier time maintaining backward compatibility, instead of having to
stringently stick with the latest release.
