You are right there is no way that that helm is worth 2k. The SSB is far superior
simply due to the magic resistance. Strength is nice but it only effects max
damage, it only has a small effect on your average damage. Plus, you
reach diminishing returns the higher your strength gets. You already have 150
and that's plenty. Strength items are easy to come by, magic resistance items
are not.
