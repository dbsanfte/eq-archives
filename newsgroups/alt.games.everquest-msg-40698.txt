True. I was in gfay, and listening to the beggars battle chants ring
out while doing some cultural smith work. (ick, Forage is the WORST
way to get needed materials)

While doing this, I watched a young gnome warrior battle wasps and
bats ferociously. I offered a heal and some buffs, as I like to reward
people who really try. He thanked me politely, and commented on how
much fun he was having. 

 I gave him a quest. I told him I needed bat wings, and would reward
him well for 2 stacks of them. Then I had to explain what a stack was.
He was thrilled, he had been manually looting bat wings and bones, and
setting them in separate slots ;) .

He came back a bit later with 2 stacks. I gave him a backpack a piece
for them.
Each pack was a tailored one.
Both packs contained (in total) a full set of banded (small) a Shiny
brass shield, and a Coldain vellium scimitar. 

I then told him that this was a bit of a generous offer for bat wings,
and that 3 to 5pp a stack was more like it. I told him I liked that he
worked for his levels, and was polite. That's why I chose to reward
him.

It was great watching Velium shards proc on Orc pawns... Many people
asked where the hell he got a sword that proc'd at such a low level. I
know this because they immediately sent me tells begging for one....
Grr....
