I'll also add to this my wife's character (almost said "toon" lol):

(The Ultimate) Breath of Life
18th Level Defender (Empathy/Radiation)
Citizen of the Protector Server, Paragon City

Also, Danny has a full stable of characters on Protector and I sidekicked
him last night while I was dinging 18. He was playing a level 8 Blaster
named Solar - Flare.

Also, note that my Doc Justice character is not on Protector, so if this is
a list of just Protector server players he should be removed.

Thanks for putting this together!
