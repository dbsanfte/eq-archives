In order for a level 21 to hit for 80 damage, he'd have to be wielding
weapons with a damage of at least 35, depending on strength.  I'm not sure
how many one handed weapons exist with a damage rating that high, much less
one a level 21 could actually use.

And whoever claimed to be grouping with a level 20ish warrior with 30,000
hit points, please.

You guys lose whatever point you're trying to make about twinking when you
rely on such exaggerations.  You really can make the argument without them.
