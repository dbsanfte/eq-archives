I am going to go out on a limb here, and assume that Martin is having a
problem with someone, quite possibly from this newsgroup, either following
him around in other newsgroups, or sending him email, or perhaps having gone
even farther.  The person doing so is not identifying themselves in the same
manner, if at all, as they do in this newsgroup.

I don't expect that his rant will yield any results for him in so far as
stopping whatever is happening, or learning the identity of the person doing
so, but that is a different issue.  I suspect, he also needed to vent
somewhere, and did so here.
