I do and anyone else thats into 'Classic Car' why even a beat up old
65 vette can go for a few thousand. Its called 'RESALE VALUE' which is
still important when you buy a car today.


I just have two questions.  What time

I've been hear for a while bro, and I don't have all the anwers to EQ,
so don't even ask me whats the spawn rate on ragefire, I don't know.
But I do know economics and number crunching and thats all I'm trying
to say here is that EQ can't last to long after the release of so many
online games at the same time. SWG and EQ2 are coming out within
months of each other, then followed by plantfall and soveriegn. Now if
they spaced them out  you could in fact keep new people coming to EQ
but as soon as EQ2 hits the shelves people tend to gravitate to newer
products. If you have a new computer and have never played EQ
why whould I buy old EQ if I can get New EQ2. ( remember consumer has
"Never" played EQ so has no bias to go on)more than likely comsumer
will buy New.
