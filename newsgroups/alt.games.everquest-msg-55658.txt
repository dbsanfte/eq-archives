My computer started to truly flake out on me a few days ago, prompting
a two long days of aggravation and repair attempts.

Along the way I did a lot of research into various possible causes of
all the bizarre stop errors I was seeing on bootup. It was rather a
surprise that the SBLive showed up in conjunction with some of them
rather frequently.

I pulled the SBLive card, and uninstalled the software. Then I went on
a long hunt for the drivers that SBLive installs but *doesn't* remove
when it's supposed to. The last of these, PFModNT, was a considerable
PITA. Even after the file itself was long gone, the system kept trying
to load it as a driver. I hate ripping things out via RegEdit, but
desperate times lead to desperate measures.

I'm not sure what I did that really finally fixed the problem.
Frankly, I'm not convinced that the problem *is* fixed. Along the way
it felt a lot like the HDD controller on the motherboard was failing.

Anyhow, one of the steps was to replace the SBLive with a cheapo ($40)
Philips Seismic Edge. And whaddyaknow, the sounds in EQ are right for
the first time since I upgraded to Win2k ages ago.

The music isn't great - the SBLive has a wonderful instrument set that
the PSE doesn't come close to matching. But the environmental and
effect sounds (combat, spells, buttons, etc) are all there, and all
the appropriate volume level.

It was strange seeing how the opinion of the SBLive changed over time.
When I researched it before buying it, it was the darling of the
industry, with everyone clamoring about how great it was. Now, though,
it's a pariah, and Creative gets a lot of (well deserved) flak for
having not updated the drivers for a very long time.

If I ever get back into music production, I may well have to go back
to the SBLive, just for the excellent instruments and sound fonts, but
meanwhile, EQ sounds work right again.
