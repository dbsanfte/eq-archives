Necros are great until high lvls then they just become mana batteries. Its
really terrible and Verant needs to fix it. Before people start saying this
isn't so, think about the high end game, every spell is resisted, your pet
is not welcome due to pathing faults within the game, that leaves dumping
mana to the clerics and summoning corpses. Not very much compared to the
gods that they are around lvl 40.
