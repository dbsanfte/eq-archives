Shaman can solo fine.  I was soloing reds with my barb shaman up to lv
34, and I've seen shaman solo their entire carrer.  It'll be much easier
if you are a troll though and can get ahold of thier snare item. 
Admittedly they can't solo anywhere near a mage/necro/druid, but are
otherwize fine, and more valuable in a group. 

I would not suggest PLing at least up to the point you leave Paludal
around 25-27, as it's hardly worth the effort, you'll level maybe at
1&1/2 to 2x faster, and frankly can get almost the same effect by paying
for a kei (50pp usually).  Get a kei and you will be able to solo really
well up through 15 in a hurry, go to paludal till 25-27, you'll slow way
down after that, but can still solo up through 35 in various areas with
kei really well (this is the only time I would consider PLing from
25-35) then can do trepp quest to 39 at least (net you about 1.5k as
well), gaining a level about every 3-4 hours. and from there you should
be able to figure it out.
