Because none of it really is much of a spoiler. All the info
is plastered all over web sites and freely known in game.
The quests in EQ are mostly not of the variety you can figure
out yourself like the "spoilers" in single player RPGs which is
exactly why it is more encouraged. Quests in EQ generally 
require lots of other info like factions, how long the quest will
take, how long you will have to camp which often have no 
real "spoiling" aspect. 

Let me give you an example, the one very very extremely obscure way of
reliably and easily raising erudin merchants
faction is to give some guy in freeport lanterns for a stackable wood
chip you then give to an erud merchant. The guy in freeport is in a
room near the dwarf you give muffins to in the hogcaller in. The guy
never asks for lanterns, nor offers to give you wood chips which will
raise erudin merchants. No one in erudin mentions this guy or raising
erudin merchants via him. So telling someone this quest is not so much
of a "spoiler" as telling them something they'd NEVER KNOW otherwise.
I think actually giving the lanterns to the guy is some totally
disconnected bow quest or something in Gfaydark. So, what are the odds
that the person wanting a better way to raise erudin merchants and
scrouring a newsgroup is NOT wanting a spoiler and in fact would be
trying to do that bow or whatever quest in Gfaydark, while also trying
to do the wood chip Pearls of Odus quest with Emil Parsini and SOMEHOW
get the connection that it was the same wood chips? The odds are
pretty dang astronomical that such would occur, welcome to the world
of questing in Everquest.

Spaces demonstrating spoiler space cut.

Because it is the point of such games to find the quests in them
and you can find them through normal play. Apart from the various
obvious quests that some npc offers you when you first talk to them,
most of the Everquest quests you see on sites like Allakhazam's would
be unknown except for many different people finding out parts and
comparing notes.
