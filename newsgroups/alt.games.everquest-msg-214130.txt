I'm fairly new to Everquest, having been introduced to it by a friend 2
months ago, and was having a lot of problems with it until I found this
newsgroup. I would just like to say thank you to all of you who take the
time to answer posts, it is of great help to us newbies struggling to
succeed in the game.
