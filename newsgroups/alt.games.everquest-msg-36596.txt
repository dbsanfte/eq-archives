I'm not sure that's a good assumption based on the way that Kunark
was implemented.   Non-Iksar low-levels have to face some higher-level
zones to get to anyplace they can hunt safely, unless they're going to
the mudhole area in OT.

If it does involve a simple triggered port (like access to CC, for instance)
I imagine the travel to that portal will be a bit lengthy and dangerous,
and Great Divide would be the perfect spot:   no direct port (unless
you've been there before) and the travel is dangerous, but not to the
point where it's impossible.
