And, even though I've been charmed once myself (Ezmirella
in NK), I gotta ask this because maybe it just blew
right over my head. When you're charmed, you aren't
able to 'see' what you're doing, right? From my POV,
Ezzy charmed me, I started running and nothing I did
made any difference in the running. But, after I got
control of myself again, I was told I had obliterated
an innocent lower-level player. Did I?
