Right. Like it wasn't obvious to anyone. Big changes result in
multiple patches. Not exactly rocket science, especially when we've
got over three years of experience to draw on.

They will keep EQ on as long as it's profitable overall. That's how
business works.

Right. So, by your claim there were 400k subscribers in the *first*
year, but now there are only 200k subscribers left. Fully *half* of
those 200k were on at one time in the past few days. That's *after*
the rough patches, as well, when "quite a few have [...] stopped
play".

And you wonder that people think you're full of shit?
