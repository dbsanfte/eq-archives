You probably wouldn't have liked me as a GM :)

If a particular character was stuck in a Silence spell, I wouldn't let the 
player talk.

If a character with a very low intelligence came up with a really good 
idea; sorry, they couldn't use it.

Sorry, I really don't see it as anything other then the price I pay for 
playing a casting class. And once I reach 35th level (someday), I won't 
have to worry about it anymore.
