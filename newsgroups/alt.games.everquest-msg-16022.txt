Certainly MANY people started playing EQ because it was "pretty."  Others
because they were tired of being ganked.  Of course, others because their
friends or relatives got them hooked.

>>not to mention the graphics [of AC] pale in comparison so EQ
continued to attract more of the "kewl dewd" type<<

LOL, graphics catch a hell of a lot more people than the kewl dewd types.
The average player age in EQ is - I think I heard somewhere - around 22 (my
guild of 80 averages at about 32).  When someone says "kewl dewd" I tend to
think the average is about 6 years younger.

>>I seriously do not believe that the ability to hide from pvp is a major
draw
for EQ and something that will keep most players.  <<

Who's talking about "hiding" from PvP?  You say that as if every normal
human would want to gank people in MMOGs, and that PvE players are subhuman
or cowards.  I don't want to play a "role-playing" type game and gank
people.  Why should I?  Why should I be REQUIRED to be ganked?  I don't need
some masturbating teen exploding in ecstasy after killing me, nor do I get a
cheap thrill killing others in a PvE environment.  If I want to kill people
I'll PLAY an honest-to-god PvP game (I have before, I will again).  It comes
down to this.  It's a game.  You're supposed to have fun in a game.  For
those who have never been ganked in UO or RZ who decide that these PvP
FORCED MMOGs sound pretty cool, I don't doubt at all that after being ganked
10 times by some little asshole they might just decide to come back to
civilization.

It would be stupid of me to suggest that NONE of those same people will
decide they LIKE to be ganked.  To them...they're welcome to the new game.
I much prefer to play with civilized people.

EQ is a game for those who are more mature...those who have lived through
Q2, Q3, Tribes, Unreal, and hell, Battletech and are just damned tired of
PvP all the time, and damned tired of the cheaters and the hackers and the
little boys (of any age).

I hope you're going to suggest that there's even one single PvP MMOG that
won't have their fair share of little asshole PKers who will make it hell
for any of the serious gamers.  So far (as far as I know) every MMOG or
pre-MMOG game claimed that THEY would be different...and so far, none have
succeeded.
