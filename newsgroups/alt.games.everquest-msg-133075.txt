Well, by sticking to the outdated characters, you are making sure that 
more and more people see you the way you don't want to be seen, as they 
upgrade their hardware. I had some misgivings about the Luclin models

them off once for a Fear raid, and I nearly puked... "Argh, that origami 
horror is not me, is it? Argh!".
