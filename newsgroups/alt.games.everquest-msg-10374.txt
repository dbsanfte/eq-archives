I think killing the gnolls messes up your faction with the dwarfs, and may
affect your ability to bank, shop, etc. in Thurgadin. I'm getting ready to
move my monk to Velious, and my one high level friend did tell me not to
kill the gnolls. I'm going to do some more research on what affects what
faction, and be careful not to kill anything until I'm sure it's okay. I
plan on getting a bind in Thurgadin and hanging out there for the at least
the next few levels (currently 33, one death out of 34).
