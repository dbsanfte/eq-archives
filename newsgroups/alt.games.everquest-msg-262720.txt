Don't know about that one.  There's no doubt it's dangerous, but the
fact that it's allowed by Christian views is the point.  Pro-life and
pro-Capital punishment are not at odds by the Christian view.  Whether
or not we exercise that punishment as a society is a different
argument.  It's strictly the inconsistency you mentioned that I was
refuting.
