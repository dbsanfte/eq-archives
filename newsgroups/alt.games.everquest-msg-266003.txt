I just want a simple text-based thing.  Say I'm in the Commonlands.  I want
to press a button, or hit a checkbox labeled "show only quests for this
zone" or something like that, and have it show the entries in my journal
that have the word "commonlands" in them.

Note that gives no information that is not already in the quest journal.  It
just makes it easier to find.  Without that, what I would do when going to
the Commonlands for a quest is click the "expand all" thingy, and then
scroll through looking for the word "Commonlands".

I'm not asking for something that goes beyond the text.  E.g., if the text
said to find Soandso and did NOT tell me what zone they are in, I don't want
something to tell me when I get to the correct zone (I'm presuming the quest
author left the zone out for a reason).

I was seeing it last weekend.

Yeah, I saw that one, too.  I think I also got skill up updates minutes
after I should have sometimes.

No, I only managed to get time to play 5 or 6 times, and only made it to
level 10 (has about 12 hours /played).  And one of those sessions was a
money grind session to pay my rent so I could talk to the slumlord to
advance the citizenship quest (I sent feedback on that, suggesting that
perhaps the first rent should be delayed until after citizenship).  So, all
my time was either in Freeport and its districts, the Ruins, and the
Commonlands.
