If you are in the full-screen mode, do Alt-M to bring up that little box
and click on the "Abilities" button. You have six buttons there to
choose from, each one corresponds to a /doability command. The layout is
as follows:

1 2
3 4
5 6

So, if the top-left button is set to forage, you can put /doability 1 in
a social key and it will forage. 

The other doability keys are on your "Combat" menu. They are as follows:

Melee Attack    Range Attack
    7                 8
    9                 10

So, if you have something in the bottom-right slot on your combat menu,
you would use /doability 10. 

Hope this helps!

Brent
