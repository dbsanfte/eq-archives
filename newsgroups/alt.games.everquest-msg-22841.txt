This is one of those dummy questions that it's just easier to ask then wade
through articles. I have a friend who wants to have an EQ party at his place
so that several of us can bring our pc's over and play in the same room. He
has a cable connection and windows 98 (so no ics, but I can upgrade him to
me or 2k no worries). Anyway, here's the question he doesn't know a pc from
a toaster so I know he can't set it up, and I've never played with anything
but existing networks and my dial up, so I hate to brake his connection.
What I understand is that his cable provider assigns him an IP address, what
I'm afraid of is that if I setup up ics on his machine it will change his IP
address to something universal and that will prevent him from getting on. I
have about a dozen extra network cards and a 5 port repeater and plenty of
cabling, he could buy additional IP address but that would sort of defeat
the purpose. Any suggestions?
