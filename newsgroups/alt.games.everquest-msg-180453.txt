For most mobs near that area they wont be KOS to you unless you are
fighting something. Kind of strange that the prisoners will leap into
the fray helping out sentries. I havent noticed any change in behavior
based on level (up to 55 that is).

You could try one of the halls that leads to the zone out. Ive hunted
there quite a bit and nothing naturally wanders through these halls
unless aggrod. A few tips: always pull the iksar prisoner first, or he
will aggro along with any pull nearby. Pulling the sentries is tricky
because of wacky pathing there. Sometimes, if you pull him in the hall
near the ZO halls, he'll run off but when he hits a corner, he'll turn
back and pathing will be ok from that point. But its dicey. Sometimes
it works and sometimes it doesnt. Everything else seems to path "ok"
in the area tho.

But being near the zone out is like playing on the train tracks. If
its real busy there - that could be a problem - especially when a high
guardian is trained to there.
