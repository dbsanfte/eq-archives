It's in the dreadlands, only go there if you are high enough to get thru
there alive.  My guildie got me killed once taking me thru there when I was
too low to survive a few hits by the spiders near the FV zone.  Never have
taken that port again.  You can also get to kunark by taking the Gfay spire
down from Luclin, hoofing it to Butcherblock and taking the boat.  Long trip
that way but you won't die.
