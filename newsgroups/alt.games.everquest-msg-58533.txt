Neriak or Felwithe.  I haven't checked in Felwithe to see who sells them.

To practice, start with the least expensive non-trivial gem.  Assuming that
you've put in 20 points at the trainer, that'd be Silver Cat's Eye Agate.

When it trivials (skill 22), move to the next gem.  When you've reached the
point where gem+silver is more than the cost of electrum+malachite, switch
to electrum+malachite.  Some people postpone that switchover for a few more
gems to minimize the failure rate.  I wouldn't go farther than silver+topaz
before switching.

You do not need to enchant the metal to practice.  This can save you a great
deal of time, but the resulting jewelry will sell back to the merchant for
slightly less than it would if you had enchanted it.  Enchanted stuff sells
back for slightly more than cost of materials.  With silver and electrum,
you fail often enough that it's not really worth it to enchant (IMHO), but
once you start doing gold, enchant every bar.  When you get to higher skill
levels, your failure rate drops enough that you will be able to cover the
cost of failures by selling back the stuff you succeed on.

Just buy from the merchant.  People usually sell any gems they get back to
merchants because there isn't a lot of player demand for them.

Qeynos has a complete jewelry selection in one shop, and is one of the
better places to practice jewelry.  At any given time, there's usually an
enchanter or two practicing.

Maximize your INT.  INT governs skill increases.  The higher your INT, the
faster you'll advance.  Some people will recommend DEX as well, but DEX has
no known effect on jewelry.  And contrary to what you may hear, there is
NOTHING that will affect success rate.  Just go for the highest INT you can. 
If you see a high-level enchanter there, politely ask them for INT and CHA
buffs (and clarity/breeze if you're enchanting the bars). They'll help a
lot.

At level 6, you probably won't be able to afford to advance the skill much. 
I started at level 8, but I had another character to fund my advances. 
Around level 10 or 15, you should be able to start camping the bandit farms
in West Karana.  I remember the bronze weapons there selling for a few plat
each.

www.eqtraders.com is an excellent resource for looking up vendors, and
there's a jewelcraft forum chock-full of useful stuff.

Another good place to look is Gumkak's site:
