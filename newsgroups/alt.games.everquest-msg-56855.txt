  I'd been making a habit recently of camping out near Dyllin Starshine's 
spot in hopes of getting the last piece of my Testament of Vanear. 
Unfortunately, I never really had the kind of time to devote to the camp 
that a lot of other players do, so whenever I'd log in, either someone 
else would be camping him or he'd be nowhere to be seen.
   Last night, though, I logged in and Dyllin popped up right in front of 
me about three seconds later. After taking a careful look around to make 
sure no one else had dibs, I waited for his smuggler buddies to clear the 
area and then proceeded to snare and nuke the holy living hell out of 
him. 
   I got the page off his smoldering corpse, pulled the rest out of the 
bank...and as of about 2 AM MST today, I'm the proud owner of a brand-new 
shiny Testament of Vanear. Yay, me.
