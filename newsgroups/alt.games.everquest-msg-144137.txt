Yes. It is too much to ask. The whine "we're just dealing with your
buggy content" is a favorite of exploiters and it has never held
water. Exploits are *defined* by taking advantage of bugs in the game
to avoid or trivialize encounters. You agree not to exploit when you
click "I Accept." If you don't agree to those terms, don't play the
game. Maybe EverQuest would be the poorer for the lack of these
particular uberguilds, but the assumption that this gives you the
right to play the game by different rules than the rest of us is
flat-out wrong.

Uberguilds need to get over the idea that they are beta testers.
People on TEST are beta testers. If an uberguild wants to move en
masse to TEST and then bitch if they get banned for testing possible
exploits, more power to em, but as long as they're on production
servers, they need to get over the idea that their shit don't stink.
