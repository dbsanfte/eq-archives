That wouldn't explain 4 melee all zoning out at once, though.  One, perhaps,
if he clicked to target and got the exit instead.  A second, perhaps,
violating the "use assist unless you are MT" rule and doing the same thing.
All three tanks making the same bonehead mistake (and using mouse pointer to
target instead of f8) at the same time?  Strains credulity.  Could it have
been a practical joke?  After all, mob was mezed, wouldn't take long to zone
out and back in, and they could all have a hearty chuckle at OP's expense...
