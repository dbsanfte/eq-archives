    I take nerfed to mean "reduced in power from a previous state", not "is
a gimp class". And necromancers have been nerfed a LOT. Jakugg, you weren't
around pre-Kunark. A single necromancer could solo the Lord room in Lower
Guk. A necromancer could break a room, Feign, and come back next morning to
see what level he was. A group of six mid-teens Necromancers were the first
to kill a Sand Giant. And handing their pet a pair of Fine Steel Daggers
actually gave the pet the delay of the daggers, back when the 49 pet hit for
70's? and had what was it, 1K more HPs? Oh, and don't forget the moving
target DoT nerf.

    Go to a necromancer class board, and ask for a listing of all the nerfs
that have hit them. Or, if an obliging necromancer is out there, post them
all for us. Then realize that when Kunark came out, they went from insane
damage dealers to mana batteries at the "endgame". Trust me - they have been
nerfed more than any other class. Whether they deserved it is another story.

    People complain for different reasons. Pure support classes complain
that they hate being pure support classes, or that they changed from being
damage dealers and masters of mayhem to support classes in the endgame
(necro, mage). Solo classes complain they get the shaft in the endgame,
endgame classes complain they can't solo, and hybrids complain they can
neither solo nor contribute what to THEM is meaningfully in the endgame. And
a good half dozen classes all think they, and they alone, should be the top
class for damage output over time, or damn near close. The classes you
listed - what complaints do they have? Well....

Necro - too little space to list here, almost all complaints to do with
their endgame roles.
Druid - again, mostly endgame whining. They like to use the phrase "port
bitch" a lot.
Warriors - too equipment dependent, if something goes wrong they have no way
to avoid death like almost every other class, monotonous to play (few
decisions to make with a warrior).
Cleric - no utility spells at all (and all the gripes that go with it), no
real ability to do anything to a mob without being cussed at by the party.
Boredom.
Enchanters - endgame role (buff, then either camp or suicide tash) is MUCH
reduced.
