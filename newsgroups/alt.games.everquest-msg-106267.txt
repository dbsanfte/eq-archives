rofl... dumbass... you never heard of the xp bonus for a full group?
And aren't you sick of medding for 5 minutes and only being able to fight
for 2? 4 If you're root/dotting? Try grouping... hell, start a newbie warr
or cleric and just TRY grouping, even if it's only for a day.

Solo downtime is the biggest reason Warriors don't solo... it's not that
they can't fight and beat experience giving Mobs, it's the 30 minutes
between fights while they sit healing the last 50% after spending 5 plats
worth of Bandages! :o)

>You keep all the loot too.

Big whoop... I just LOVE lugging all that FS to Freeport and getting a
suckky 4-6pp a pop :o) And I love spending 10 minutes looking for a 'doable'
blue on track, chasing it across the zone, only to find a group already
kicking it's ass!

Ever played in the KEEP (not out in the Pass with the Orcs... INDOORS!). The
loot is good, you can bank IN THE SAME ZONE, the pulling is as fast as you
want it to be (or faster... TRAIN!) :o)
