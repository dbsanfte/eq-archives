One possibility is a bad memory chip.  I had similar problems
on one computer until I tracked it down to bad memory, high up.
Only EQ sucked up enough memory to reliably hit the bad spot.

I found a lot of useless "memory test" utilities until I ran
across this one, it worked when the others didn't.  (I know
this is not a binary newsgroup, but it's a small file and I lost
track of where it came from originally, so sue me.)
