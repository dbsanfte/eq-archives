Most of the time it boils down to snipping skills. While it is
annoying to page down forever to read the new text, it bugs me even
more if I read a top posted reply and then have to page down a zillion
times to find the tail end of the previous post in order to see what
the top poster was replying to.

And personally, I prefer interlaced posting :)
