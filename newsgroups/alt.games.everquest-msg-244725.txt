All this proves is that the server side plays a role in interpreting
the data. It doesn't prove that the item doesn't exist client-side...
Graphics, stats, and so forth are all part of the item. So is "access"
to the item.

Nevermind that Lucy's item database comes from digging through the
CLIENT SOFTWARE...
