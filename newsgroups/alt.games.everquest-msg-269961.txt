Starting over is painful.  Ask any EQ1 player that prefers the Firiona
Vie server, which only has one character slot per account.  I've often
regretted (months later, of course) deleting a particular race/class
combo and starting a new one.

I eventually gave up on the FV server because the one character limit
was too onerous for me.  I tried other servers...but none of them felt
right.  FV felt like home, the rest felt...not like home.  The other
servers did let me explore lots of alternative race/class combos,
which was nice, but...  It just wasn't the same.

There is no doubt I would have stuck with EQ1 for *much* longer had
the FV server allowed more characters.  (And, no, I didn't want them
for twinking purposes - I never twinked.)

The four character limit is downright terrible.  I won't touch EQ2
because of it.  Even if SOE boosts the limit, I'll probably never
touch EQ2, because it just shows what cheap, greedy, money-grubbing
fuckers SOE really are...
