This was posted on the Erollisi Marr Board. I haven't been able to find it
at any official location yet.

"Ubi Soft Entertainment, a global leader in the field of interactive
entertainment announced today the confirmed release dates for the third
EverQuest expansion - EverQuest: The Shadows of LuclinT. For Germany and
Japan release will be from 6th December 2001. The United Kingdom and
Scandinavia will follow on the 7th of December. France, Italy, Spain,
Netherlands and Australia will release no later than the 13th December.
Release in the USA remains set at 4th December 2001.

Ubi Soft understands the global nature of playing a massively multiplayer
game such as EverQuest, and how different release dates may well be the
source of upset for players of the game. It is for this reason that Ubi Soft
whole-heartedly apologies to the many fans of the game, both that the
release date will not be simultaneous with the USA and for the incorrect
European and World-wide release dates previously communicated.

The actual reason for the delay following the USA release, is due primarily
to the different weekday release of new titles, but also in part to the
longer manufacturing and distribution processes that generally exist for
Europe and the rest of the world. Overall, it is of key importance that Ubi
Soft can guarantee that the game's distribution is as uniform and smooth
across all territories as is possible.


EverQuest is the singular most popular and successful massively multiplayer
RPG in the world. In excess of 400,000 subscribers and dedicated fans have
helped establish the critically acclaimed EverQuest as 'the' defining online
game in its genre. This dedication has not gone unheeded, with the
developers constantly fine-tuning the game, round-the-clock customer support
and the playing world itself being extended with expansion packs The Ruins
of Kunark� and The Scars of Velious� already available.
EverQuest continues to evolve, and as it does it is moving from strength to
strength in providing a unique online gaming experience. With the
introduction earlier this month of the first dedicated European Server in
London, UK and the implementation of an automated translation system later
this year, commitment to the global enjoyment of EverQuest fans worldwide is
absolute.

The Shadows of Luclin will see a further evolution in the EverQuest
experience. Not only will a whole new area be introduced for exploration and
adventure, but the expansion will also add major graphical improvements to
the entire series reaffirming it as a visual online gaming gem.

Fans in Europe and across the world - we ask you.please be patient"
