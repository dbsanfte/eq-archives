Yeah, that was always my position in the past regarding NBG in a
pickup group.  And were I to dust Kaev off and resume playing him
that would likely continue to be his worldview.  But, as I pointed
out, that view relies on the unspoken assumption that the main
reason for being in a pickup group is to better your character,
from which follows the obvious implication that you'd better look
out for number one because that's what everybody else is doing
(assumption #2:  everybody else is here for the same reason I am).
OTOH, if your purpose is to "win friends and influence people",
NBG can be the guild-building equivalent of the puller choosing
to "take one for the team".
