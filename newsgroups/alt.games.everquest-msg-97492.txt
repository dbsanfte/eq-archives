A minor bug not many know about - the items gm gives are often
invisible in the trade window. I have no idea why its like that.

Have a bit of pity for a GM in a situation like that, though. They
have to deal with 130 people talking to them at once. It can get
pretty hard to follow what's going on and who's doing what sometimes
(or so I've heard *cough*).

There are a lot of events that have gms dealing with small amounts of
people (more than is generally known, on some servers at least). But
ones with Cazic in Ill Omen are not likely to be in this category. :-)
