First of all, 50% fail rate on something that's trivialed is a SERIOUS
run of bad luck. 25% has been the absolute worst for me...

Also, being good enough that you've learned all you can from making
something, even IRL, doesn't mean that you're so adept that you'll
almost never screw it up. Sometimes it takes a more complex
application of a skill in a trade to reveal better ways of doing the
basics.

When the item trivials, it simply means you can't learn any new tricks
from the method you're using to make it at that skill level. It
doesn't mean that you've discovered the *best* way to make it... Thus,
you'll run a bigger chance of producing a product that is flawed.

Wow. Someone dodging the point. You go, Teckla!

For the record, I am not now, never have, and likely never will say
the tradeskill system is perfect. It is, however, adequate.
