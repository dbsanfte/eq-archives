    Unless the factions in question cannot be raised in game. A druid's
faction with certain animals, a dwarf's faction with desert madman-type
mobs, Orc, and Kaladim Citizens - these are examples of factions that cannot
be raised, which are either non-alterable or which can only be reduced.
Maybe not much of a disadvantage, but these are disadvantages that stay with
a character forever.
