East freeport sewer merchants will with no work.

Druid ring merchants will with no work, since beta neutral.

The erudite lady in the last middle inn in east commons, before the WC
zone, will sell to you with no work. She is beta neutral.

Murrissa sanwicher will sell to you with no work, she is just out of
east freeport in the North ro zone (on the sand of the newb area)
She is on Dervish faction, so if you've killed dervishes she will no
longer like you.

The three guys in the East Commons tunnel who are vendors sell to
anyone.

That should be good to get you started, if in the freeport area.
