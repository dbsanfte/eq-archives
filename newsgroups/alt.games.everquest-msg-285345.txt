When the "Group" button got added to the in-game maps a little
while back, the X's marking other group members were in blue.
More recently, they got changed to be dark grey.  (They turn
full black when you mouse over them to see the person's name.)
I was annoyed by the change since I thought the blue worked
better, but it wasn't that big a deal, so /shrug.

Well, last night I happened to look over my wife's shoulder and
saw that on HER map the X's are GREEN.  I know she hasn't
installed any UI mods (except for a few I've given her) or done
anything deliberate with her settings to change this.  Has anyone
else seen non-gray X's recently, or know how to change the color?
