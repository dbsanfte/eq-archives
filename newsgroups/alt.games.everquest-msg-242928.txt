38 getting experience with a 58? Something is amiss here, I just logged in
my bro's 58bst, and grouped up with my 38 druid .. no experience.

Grouped My 58 beast with his 39th druid, and presto experience.

General equation for this:
    Character Level(if EVEN number) + (character level div 2)
    Character level (if ODD) + ((character level - 1) div 2)

38th level + ( 38 / 2) = 57
39th level + ( (39 - 1) / 2) = 58

I am going to retry the above combo 58/38 and see what happens with
green(to 58th) mobs ...

Anyone post a link *from* soe/verant that actually dictates the equation?
