I decided to start my first ever melee character, and it happened to be a
Wood Elf Rogue, worshipping Bristlebane (I don't do agnostic characters
since it makes the game too easy). He is currently poking orcs in Crushbone,
and just got his Backstab. I do have an option of powerleveling by my guild,
but I'd rather avoid it if possible.
I must admit I am absolutely clueless on how to play melee (even pertaining
choices of weapons and armour), so I would really appreciate any advice,
strategies, explanations and any links. I can afford twinkage, but not sure
how necessary it is at present.

Thank you in advance.
Feel free to fame me for Race/Deity choice as well, if it was a major
mistake.

Venome, wanna-be-assassin of Lanys
