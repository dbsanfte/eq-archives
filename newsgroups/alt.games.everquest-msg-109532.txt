If they do anything, they should maybe just add maybe a bit more in the way
of alternative transportation to make them completely useless (arguably,
they already are useless)...then perhaps add some content to the boat ride
itself just to make it fun...or perhaps create some semi-useful quests that
require stuff you can only forage on the boat.  You know...to keep them from
being UTTERLY useless.

I would hate to see them go.

But on the up-side...we did get horses, so if they want to ease their woes
by getting rid of them, I guess I can't fault them for it.
