No, I don't think it does.  You get the icon for both, they don't 
conflict, but this is true of some other hastes, in particular normal 
bard haste.  What happens with normal bard haste is that you get 
whichever haste is higher, but both buffs stick, because bard haste has 
other buffs which do benefit you.

I believe this is also the case with Burnout, which boosts Strength

I'm frequently in groups where a shaman or enchanter with too much mana 
or too little sense hastes my pet.  Often the haste is lower than 
burnout's which means it has little effect.  Sometimes, however, its 
actually larger than burnout's... which doesn't stop me from keeping 
burnout on my pet.  Burnout costs little, has a long duration 
(especially because of course I'm wearing my summoned extended 
enhancement focus item when I cast it), and its up whenever the mildly 
better chanter haste wears off.

The shaman in question is lower level than I am and does not have a 
better haste than the burnout I'm using, she never even bothers casting 
her haste on my pet... I suppose it would come in handy when burnout 
fades and I'm halfway accross the zone looking for the next pull.... but 
thats infrequent and seems like a waste of mana, her haste wears off 
more frequently than mine.

What would probably be interesting is to look into the other benefits of 
hastes like Augment, which like burnout offer more than just attack 
speed adjustment.  Augment also has a longer duration, making it less of 
a pain.

But the buffs I'm talking about are Strength (has been parsed at around 
10% more damage at the 50ish level, I've read), AC (pet AC is in the 
range where every bit of AC helps; this means giving him summoned plate 
and having AC buffs cast on him work wonders)  HP in the form of the 
shaman HP buff plus Stamina, SOW which is faster than Expedience meaning 
pet engages sooner, backs off more reliably, does better at the "get it 
off me" job (for this it helps that I'm also SOWed instead of just at 
Run 3 speed) and gets more hit opportunities while finishing off runners 
and most importantly, Chloroplast; a long duration regen buff that 
coupled with the AC boost make a marked difference in HP loss.

For real fun, give pet proccing weapons and have the shaman also boost 
his Dex up.

For tough targets (not the HG) shaman offers a powerful and effective 
slow line, which allows the mage's pet more opportunity to do damage, as 
effective in its way as haste would be.  For easy targets I rely more on 
AC to lessen the impact of incoming blows and regen to keep HP up, since 
this means the mob is killing itself on the powerful pet DS.
