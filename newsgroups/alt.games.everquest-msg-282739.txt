There are a few other factors, but the two weapons are pretty similar.
A main-hand weapon proc will fire about once a minute, if you have
average Dex (I think it goes up to twice a minute, for 255 Dex, without
AA's).  The damage bonus of two-handed weapons also varies, based on
the weapon's delay (and your level).  You can check Lucy for the
details, but the difference will be small, since the weapons have
similar delays.

The formula typically used is:
DPS = ( 2*damage + bonus ) / delay
The bonus only exists for melee classes above level 28 or so.
Otherwise, it is proportional to damage/delay.  Damage from the proc
would be added to this (e.g. 20pt proc, once per minute, for 20/60 =
0.333 added DPS).

If it were my choice, I would go with the 32/36+proc.  On the other
hand, it isn't enough of an upgrade to go crazy over.  Since you
mention it would be a huge cost to you, I would pass on buying it in
the bazaar.
