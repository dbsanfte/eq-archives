A tank who can't hold agro just isn't a tank, and is taking up a space 
in the group that could be used to fill a needed role.  "Group looking 
for snare caster!"

Two friends of mine started warriors, and we've been grouping for 3 
years now.  But one quit playing his warrior and the other hardly plays, 
because we have a pally.  He's much better at pulling, just as good at 
tanking until high levels, better at getting agro, and he can heal and 
root.  Sure, his DPS is laughable, but we'd get a necro or ranger for 
DPS over a warrior I think.
