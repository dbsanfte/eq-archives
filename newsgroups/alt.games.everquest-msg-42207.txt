An upgrade in armour will probably do wonders. Raw silk is a good change from
cloth, cured silk is better. Not only does it weigh .1 and give better AC but it
also looks damn sexy! ;) Remember your weight restriction. If you're carrying
over 15 in weight you'll suffer a major AC penalty.

You never said what race you were. I can't vouch for the human monk but my Iksar
has no problems soloing. Field of Bones (mainly) got me to lvl 20, the northern
end of the Overthere is where I'm soloing now and getting good experience from
succulents and rhinos. I also went from lvl 22 (lvl 21 actually as I died almost
immediately on arrival) to lvl 23 in EK whilst hunting for silks.

IMHO you should make a point of only attacking high blues, 'looks kind of
dangerous' and 'looks quite risky', that run away from you when their HP get low
enough. Otherwise attack only the lower blues, 'looks quite risky, but you might
win' and 'you would probably win this fight .. it's not certain though'. HTH. :)
