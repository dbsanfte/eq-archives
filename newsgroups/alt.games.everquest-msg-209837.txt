Neither a warrior or a knight class, no.  However, I have grouped with 
warriors and with paladins and SKs.  And I stand by my statement.  In a 
raid where we want defensive discipline, sure, a warrior is needed.  In 
an XP group, the cleric blows more mana healing either me for slowing too 
early, or the warrior for fighting a not yet slowed mob, than he uses to 
heal a knight class fighting an already slowed mob.

Don't get me wrong, I am not so anal about getting perfect groups that I 
will search high and low for a knight class rather than take a warrior.  
I play in many sub optimal groups, and I have lots of fun doing so.
