Wait until you clear the entire zone and Tunare poofs on you, twice.. then
you will really understand what PITA truly means!

Well sure you may think shes "easy" now, did you kill her pre or post-PoP
though?  PoP trivialised every single encounter more than ANY item or
expansion in the game, ever.

If you killed her 6 months ago, or even 1 year ago, easy isn't a word that
would be used (I dunno if you did?  kudos if so, cuz it was a pretty badass
kill back then)

As new features come out the older stuff doesn't seem to matter to VI.  In
the same way that Luclin totally trivialised old-world/kunark mobs and VI
said.. well thats old stuff!  PoP came and did the same to every other
expansion in the game.

AoW was the one fight I used to love more than anything, there was real
excitement, because whether your 1st or 100th kill, a 1 second slip of
concentration and 50% of your raid would be dead in seconds..  since PoP tho
hes become trivial too(well, as trivial as a flurrying 1k hitting mob can
be), the fight just lacks the element of danger and tension now.

Theres a lot I like about PoP.. but ruining all other encounters sure isn't
1 of them.
