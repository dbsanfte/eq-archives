I was going to go to Orlando but then found out that they were charging $80
for less than 12 hours of convention (I believe the actual "meat" was about
4 hours).  Though you DO get a t-shirt. :p  I don't live near Texas so I
won't be going, so I don't know if the Dallas itinerary is anywhere near as
pathetic as Orlando's.
