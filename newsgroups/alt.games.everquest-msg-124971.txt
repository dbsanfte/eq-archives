The way I read it, the original post by Roger Ebert (of the Sun Times?) went
to...
alt.magic,alt.music.mp3.napster,alt.music.mp3,alt.music.korn,alt.guitar from
the same server as our friend, Hymie.  He was not replying (re:), he was
forwarding (FW:).  IMO he probably wrote it originally.  On top of that, he
kept the original title, which is blatantly racist, while forwarding, rather
than changing it.  The only reason to keep the title would be as a reply.  I
am still guessing here, but the name Hymie is usually used by the racist
bastards (one-word to me) to describe a person of Jewish descent.  It is
considered derogatory.
