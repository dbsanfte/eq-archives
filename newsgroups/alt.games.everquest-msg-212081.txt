Yes.  I can accept the fact that people want to call me a nutcase and
I realize that I probably need some professional help with the loss of
this friendship.  Everything that everyone has said here, I have
deserved.  

I lost a close older friend who was like a second father to me in the
summer of 1998.  That loss was very painful for me.  When I met
Anomsuth in 2002 and subsequently became friends both inside and
outside EQ, I felt a similar type friendship was forming.  What I
ended up doing was trying to rush things and ended up saying things
out of frustration that I later regretted...including what I
originally posted here.  There is a lot to this story but basically I
pushed this person away 3 months ago to the point he didn't want
anything more to do with me.  I have tried to understand all the
things I did wrong in this friendship and even asked to which I would
get the response "I don't need a reason."  We were great friends and
had a lot of fun times over the period of a year.  It was the
following 4 months where everything went downhill beyond repair.  

I don't expect anyone in this newsgroup to care enough about this
issure and I am not playing any kind of victim.  I accept the
responsibility for ruining this friendship and hope I never cause
anything like this again.  As for needing therapy, I admit to probably
needing that as well to get over this and move on.  It's just sad
losing a good friend permanently.  This has never happened to me
before.

What I did here was of poor character and irrational judgment out of
anger and frustration.
