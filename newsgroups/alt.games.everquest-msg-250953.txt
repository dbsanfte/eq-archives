- Improved the Eagle Eye series of spells.

I wonder how much this will improve DPS.  Or maybe they are just
making it last longer...

- Increased the drop rate for epic quest items in the Plane of Hate.

-The Shattered Emerald of Corruption. 
-Decrepit Hide 
-Staff of Elemental Mastery 
-Essence of Vampire 
-Eye of Innoruuk

Currently the named will pop 1 in 3 times, I think it is, and they
will drop the SEOC something like 3% of the time.  I have no idea
where the numbers come from, but everyone says the same thing.  In any
case, it is currently incredibly hard to get a SEOC.  I have been to
Hate 20 or 30 times, seen several Chanters get their essences, and
never once seen any Ranger get a SEOC.

My prediction is that the drop rates will increase by quite a bit. 
Sony is doing this because they want people to start working on their
epic upgrades.  A Ranger could spend months in Hate and not even
complete the original epic, let alone start on the upgrade.

- Necromancer pets will no longer despawn after 2 minutes when their
master is feigned.

Yes!

- A portal stone has been added to the Plane of Knowledge to take
adventurers to Gunthak.

All-in-all that is good I guess.  However, I will miss making fun of
people who complain about having to run to Gunthak.  Holy crap what a
bunch of whiners.  How about when there was one way to get to an
entire continent, called a boat, and if you died in Velious or Kunark
before you could get bound in a city there, you could enjoy making the
trip again from Freeport.  Even with Luclin, you had to wait up to 15
minutes before you ported and there was only one spot to port to per
continent.  Now I see lazy people buying ports to Stonebrunt because
that 5 minute run is too long.
