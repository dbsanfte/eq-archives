My point about /shout is that I would like to still use it in the more
realistic
range. I don't want to shut it off. If the main concern is being able to
group,
then:
roleplaying off + LFG on = zone wide advert to group

No disagreement here for a middle ground.

Hopefully not many will make stupid alts. Not all alts are stupid are they?
Hmm, a new command
/altlist <char-name>
to show you the names (class?,level?) of the related characters.

The reason I don't mind a couple more characters is that friends are going
to join me in EQ. I would like to group with them on FV without throwing
away my 29th level.

<sigh> Now that I think about it, restoring /shout, /auction and the ability
to ignore your alignment, what the heck is the difference in the FV server?
