What's your point here? You simply try over and over to make light of the
situation. I have never even seen you post before. Why from the beginning
must you try and convince others there is no concern? THERE IS MAJOR
CONCERN! And we are all targets, many of us will DIE. Many of us will have
family members who will DIE. Many of us will have friends who will DIE. Many
of us will know friends of a friend who will DIE. Many of us will see on the
news our fine soldiers DYING on the battlefiled and those people at home
DYING from terrorism. This is FACT.

We should be prepared for it instead of living in a fantasy world. This is a
war that will tax us all in determination, and population. We have to find
the resolve to meet that cost. I am behind it, and always will be. There are
NEEDS to give the population fair and substantial methods of defense, to
give hope, and real measures to improve survival rate. To protect their
children. To simply call me an idiot or crazy is simply underestimating the
cost of the war ahead. Prevention and preparation do more for others than
calling me foolish.
