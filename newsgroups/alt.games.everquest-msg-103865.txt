If a newbie is begging and being particularly annoying, I will tell them
I've turned on my auto /donate so if they want to make a small amount of
cash, all they have to do is target me and type /d to receive my donation.
Past that point, I am usually in pure evil mode and will root them, give
them a quick rundown about collecting stacks of bone chips and bat wings and
selling them for start-up cash, then I blow them up.
