It all depends on the role you are assuming.  There will be times when you
are not the one who should be soaking up the damage, and taunting the mob,
another melee may be in that role.  At that time, you want to maximize
damage, and minimize taunt, so a slow high damage weapon is a good choice,
and that generally means a 2 hander.
