Does anyone know one way or another? I was told they did early on, but I
can't find anything via google as it's so flooded with spammers trying to
sell eq2 stuff who have flooded google's engine with their rubbish. There's
nothing i can find in the online help, which doesn't really surprise me as
it is rather useless generally.
