Reserving judgement as to whether or not it'll be enough of a boost to
pacify the warriors. However, I can see that a LOT of time went into
the planning on this, and even more is going into the actual
implementing. Kinda answers the "What's taking them so long? They're
just ignoring us!" rants, though. IMO, at least.

Seriously, this is NOT something that they could effectively just slap
together, and it's probably going to take a lot of tweaking to get it
down after it goes live. This isn't a minor change...
