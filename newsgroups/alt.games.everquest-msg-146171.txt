I think you will find as you progress in levels that your meleeing skills
are not necessary at all. My 1hblunt is 64 or so at lvl 52 simply because at
higher levels you don't even want to be close to the mobs you're hunting.
They hit hard and you are going to focus more on getting your WIS high than
your ac as you rise.

As druid you play healer/buffer or nuker/dotter in groups at higher levels,
and when you don't do that you med. Quickest thing to get you thrown out of
groups is if you can't do your job because you spent time whacking at a mob
doing 20 points of damage a round to the tanks' 100-200 points. And when you
solo, you kite and will never be close to the mob unless you want to die.
Kiting starts at 14 when you get sow and snare so by that time you will be
most interested in finding a club with nice stats to fill your primary slot.
A Dark Ember is a nice item, no idea where it drops, but can be found at the
bazaar from 600 to 1k when the time comes.

I know you asked about good melee weapons, but I think you'll find most of
the above points to be true for druids. We can melee, but then again so can
a mage. Doesn't mean we do it good.
