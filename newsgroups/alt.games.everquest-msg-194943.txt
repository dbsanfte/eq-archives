I'm currently unable to get in either.  It was strange, because we
had a power hit here which lasted about 20 seconds, then after that
I was unable to get in, and 90 minutes later am still unable to connect.

I'm in the PDT time zone, the same as where many of the servers are,
so maybe there was some network glitch that occurred with the power
outage.  I don't know how widespread the outage was.  I'm here in
Oregon, and I think most of the servers are in California.

Or it could be that you will stay connected as long as you don't need to
reconnect.  If you go LD, game over for the night.
