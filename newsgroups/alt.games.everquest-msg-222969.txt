Was thinking... I belive if you have your trader window open you may
get this error.. sorta like when its open you cant interact with the
bank, vendors, or traders....

When it gives you such an error, the find trader button does not
become inactive...
and the trader button will become active again when you locate the
first trader you located....
Suposedly there is a new function to cancel a find trader.... but I
did not see any new buttons or an exact refrence on how to do it in
the patch message...
