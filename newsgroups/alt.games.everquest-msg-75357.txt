Got a legchopper off of a Greenwood tonight.  Sold it to a vendor
(indifferent faction, CHA=58) for 35pp, 8gp, and change.

Almost have a groove worked out for the perimeter patrols.  Having a bit of
a time getting root to stick on these guys ... I end up kiting them around
the fort's perimeter.  Took an Evergreen tombstone by accident ... I was
scouting and he jumped me.  Didn't get a chance to con him until he turned.
Made one foray into the fort itself ... harmonied the three hut spot, pulled
an even, and got squashed.

It's pretty funny to whack on these guys as a halfling once they turn.  I'm
popping 'em right where the achilles tendon joins the heel. :-)

And I'm increasing a skill that'll never show up in a log ... handling adds.
