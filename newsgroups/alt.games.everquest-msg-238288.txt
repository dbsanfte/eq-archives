For the most part the new DX9 engine is a good improvement.

I'm just going to put a few observations of mine up for all to see. 
Some of the negative effects may or may not be the direct result of my 
hardware.

They already have a planned patch scheduled for sometime this morning.

First: System specs: Windows 2000 Pro w/SP4 running on a P3-800, Intel 
D815EEA motherboard, 512 PC133 RAM, Geforce2 GTS 32mb vram, Sound 
Blaster Live! audio, over a 44kps (average) dialup connection.


The Observations.

Graphic details are significantly better.

Better colors and color gradients.

Significantly better 3D visual environment.

Ground spawns are easier to spot.

The moon's exterior zones are significantly darker at the same gamma 
setting.  They all look like the Shar Vahl city zone - No sky effects.

But Paludal Caverns details are not as dark and the 3D effect is much 
more visible.

Very serious loss of environment textures in the Hollowshade Moor zone 
anywhere near areas with water. Invisible water.  The actual water 
graphic is located serveral yards under the ground. Other areas were 
also reported with significant missing ground textures.

In Hollowshade Moor, I got stuck between the ground and the, now exposed 
bottom of one of those fat trees.  I had to /exit out and come back in 
to get unstuck.

Willowisps are invisible... for the most part.  They can only be seen 
nearby, and that isn't 100%.  They can not be targeted when they are not 
visible.  After being attacked and they start to run their location is 
displayed only about once every two - three seconds.  And that is with 
the targeting indicator on.  They are now harder to kill because you 
just don't know where they are and have to guess.  The only way you know 
one is near is because you can still hear them.  Even the light they 
emit is gone.

The Bazaar, while graphically better looking also takes a (another) 
significant hit in the frames-per-second displayed and thus your 
movement in it.

Avatars were getting stuck in/on walls in the Plane of Knowledge.

Door knobs are now 'physical'.  You can get hung up on them when passing 
them.  You will also get hung up, not stuck, on other items you hadn't 
before, like some trees.

Doors and other objects can now be, intentionally or unintentionally, 
climbed by player character avatars just like the mobs do.  I ended up 
on the bank's roof in the Bazaar as I walked, very closely, by one of 
the windows.


There were also supposed to be some corrected tradeskill bugs.
