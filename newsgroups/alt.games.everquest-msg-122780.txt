"original Bond" feel?? I thought it was totally different to the 
original Bond feel! It was all special effects action and no plot, like 
most big budget Hollywood blockbusters these days. Unfortunately, but 
not surprisingly, it was the highest grossing Bond film of all time 
(when movies like Independence Day and Godzilla make so much money this 
way I don't suppose we can blame them for cashing in on James Bond in 
the same manner). James Bond movies lost substance from then on IMHO.
