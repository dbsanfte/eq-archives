OK then, there are several level 13 vs ~20 mobs that will attack you and
follow you while beating on you from behind for *sure* in addition to ones
left by people pulling them to that zone line. To a level 8 ranger, getting
beat by level 13s and below is functionally equivalent to getting beat by
~20. Almost everything there will go aggresso on him because of his low
level.

BTW: I use ~ to signify approximately.
