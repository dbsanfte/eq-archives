Thanks!  It just looked odd when I re-read it.  Still does ... maybe it's
just me.

I've taken some time away from the game.  It was really starting to become
stale.  My guild had gone raid-bonkers, and too much raiding drives me
crazy.  I'm glad some folks love it ... we need all kinds in this ol' world.
But it's just not my cup of tea. :-)

So, I stepped back and loaded an oldie-but-goodie (Age of Empires) for a few
weeks.  It's amazing how much I enjoy the game when it goes back to being a
casual passtime, and how much I don't when it becomes an exercise in goal
achievement.

I guess I never was meant for glitter rock-and-roll .... I'm just a
Margaritaville kind of guy. ;-)
