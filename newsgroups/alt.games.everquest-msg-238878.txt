   Talking about non-standard LDoNs, I just finished a BB one with my
Beastlord.  Group was 2 pallies, 1 wiz, and me.  And we tore through it.  The
wiz had a botted cleric that temped us, and one of the pallys was an insane, and
very good, gnome puller.  We just kept pulling and pulling, I looted when I
could, healed while he was running over, and took the occasional heal break
where the other pally would heal also.  All of our puller's mana went to
Pacify.  The wiz never got agro, and often got the kill shot.  Mobs rarely
lasted more than 20 seconds.

   It was a blast.  I like LDoN's again.
