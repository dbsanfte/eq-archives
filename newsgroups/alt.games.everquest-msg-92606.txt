I just purchased the $10 original EQ game and starting out for the first 
time.  I was wondering if the Shadows of Luclin add-on (or any of the 
others) enhances the game in any way other than just adding zones and quests 
and models.  Are they able to improve the overall graphics for all the 
zones?  Would it be worth getting SoL now to improve the quality of my 
neophyte explorations?

Thanks,
