Nah... I never saw CowLevelRun432

(Actually, I liked the cow level... in fact. I enjoyed most of diablo2, 
except hardcore up around level 80+ could get frustrating... lost a 
couple characters (sorcerous) who could clear most areas areas in just a 
few seconds (thuderstorm, frozen orb, chainlightning all in their 30s to 
40s)... but if a mini-boss happened to be there that you didn't see... 
and it happened to have the right combo of abilties "poof" your 
instadead. Tough break for a game with perma death.)

That's part of why the hillrunz were so popular with the HC crowd... not 
just good xp, but they were safe. No randomized minibosses, just 2 in 
static spots.

LDoN could use some D2 style randomized minibosses :)
