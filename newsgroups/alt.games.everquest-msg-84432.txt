My warrior char has one hero bracer, that was purchased prior to the
time it reached a level for the quest. The char is now in the low
50's.

Question: Can the quest Hero Bracer be completed successfully if the
char is already in the possession of a Hero? I know it can't wear two,
but can it possess two?

Comments?
