    BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

    Yeah, people on points never get hosed. There's never tiny adding
"errors", or points awarded for spontaneous "events" that the people in
charge of points seem to always be at. That wouldn't be fair, and points is
ALWAYS fair!

    One of our competitors is on points. A warrior joined their guild that,
because of his play time and RL friendship with some officers, they wanted
to become a MT. The number of points he got awarded in bogus "events" was
sick. He passed every other warrior in that guild except for one officer MT,
both in quality of gear and in banked points. Wouldn't you wonder if an
elemental planes-flagged guild still gave out points for "Exploring Ssra
Temple", but only did so when certain people were online and part of the
raid?

    Repeat after me: no loot system can both be totally fair to all
involved, accurately recognize the contributions of every member, and
maximally increase guild power. All loot systems are compromises between
these three goals. Officer award can be manipulated the easiest, can better
recognize individual effort but usually misses on recognizing attendance,
and is better at minimizing "weak links" and pairing items with the classes
that can best use them. Points can be manipulated but it's harder,
recognizes attendance but doesn't account for individual effort (guild
tradesperson, strategist, etc.) well, and makes sure loot is used by people
who actually attend raids most often. Any attempt to create a hybrid system
will invariably impact one of the strengths of a system in order to shore up
a weakness. You can't win. ;-)
