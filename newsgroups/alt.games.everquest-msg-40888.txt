Hi,

I am using a Linux iptables firewall but this should make no difference.
Just be sure to allow UDP traffic on port range 1024:65535 on the following
aggregate nets: 64.37.148.0/22 and 63.241.40.0/22. This did it for me.

It's kinda weird you have to open such holes but this is the way EQ works.
And, of course, open TCP port 7000 for patch.
