OMG! You just described *exactly* the scenario of our first attempt on
him in my old mid-range guild! We had rustled up four clerics to make
our very first CHeal chain. They stood there hammering their CHeal keys
in frustration without realizing that the MA was out of range until it
was too late and he was down. Unlike you, I went down pretty fast as I
was playing my tank (SA at the time, though roughly level 52/53) and I
was toasted before anyone could shift heals over to me.
