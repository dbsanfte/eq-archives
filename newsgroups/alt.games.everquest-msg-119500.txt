I has been given multiple veleous zones to look for it, but @ the time the
tanks didnt care to join up and the monkies in WL spanked me, (one drop area
is their caves, but its taken a day or 2 ivebeen told)
 i got mine in /join auction -after trying for 2 weeks, in the middle of
that i had a seller and as he was on his way to me, my isp went down state
wide, and 2 hours later when i got back on, the spell was long sold.... it
cost me 700pp which was alot for me cause for somereason my income is
horrible :) but nice when you hit tofs, or i await to try it in lguk~
Keep auctioning in the auction channel eventually im sure some tank out
there will have looted it, just easier there then the tunnel (which is the
main place of sales on my server anyway - not sure about others-
