I find that at times, I get interrupted regardless of how long I have been
standing still.  Recently in SolB, I was acting as main healer, just stand
heal, sit, stand heal, sit.  I found that in certain places in the room, I
was always interrupted, while not getting hit, and certainly not moving.  If
I moved to a different spot in the room, the problem went away.
