Most of my lowbie twinks still wear these.  They're just plain good. :)

My warrior has one.  Looovely item.  I was able to kill Fellspine for it 
while 3boxing with a 65 enc, 64 dru, 63 Rog.  The Rogue tanked.  Badly, 
but slow stuck.  Perhaps you can get some higher level friends to help you 
out with it?  I found Fellspine after the revamps in SG in the cave 
directly beneath the zonein from CS.  So if you happen to spot him up 
(easily tracked if you have a tracking buddy, should be checkable with Eye 
of Zomm (think Stalking Probes, eh?  Made by that handy tinker friend 
you were looking for a while back. :) )) it might not be terribly out of 
the way if you can call in some friends.  Seems to pop a lot after server 
resets, that's when I found him.

[Warning! The next two long-ass paragraphs may well be irrelevant if you 
generally don't have a haster of any kind in your group, which I suspect 
may be the case! :) ]

What level is Lenny now?  If you have a relatively high level enc friend, 
it may be worth measuring what the haste cap is for your level.  I've done 
some playing around with that and found the results suprising, and usually 
inconsistent with any published tables of haste caps I've managed to find.  
Most of my measurements were at very low levels though. :)  It's possible, 
if you've managed to locate an enchanter friend, that with your usual 
haste and FBSS you'd be capped anyway.  The simplest test would be to 
calculate your actual hastedness with FBSS and your usual enc/shammy 
friend's haste, and compare it with your actual hastedness when a 58+ enc 
you've managed to bribe casts Wonderous Rapidity on you.  If you can't 
measure a significant difference between the two rates of swings, I 
wouldn't bother with a faster haste item until some levelling has 
occurred. :)  A couple notes on measuring 'actual hastedness':  turn 
'your misses' and 'your hits' on.  A lot of people log hits but not misses 
and get very confusing results. (read: I screwed up that way once. :) ) 
Turn logging on (again, duh.)  Use a weapon with a delay over 20. (This 
avoids the problem of having more than one swing in one second, resulting 
in delay-separated swings with identical timestamps). Similarly, put away 
your offhand weapon, or make sure if your main hand is slashing, your 
offhand is bashing or piercing, making it easy to sort out the swings from 
when dual weild actually worked.  Preferably, although this may be 
difficult, use a low-damage weapon on an NPC that can't hurt you much, but 
has a lot of hitpoints (or fast regen), and don't move around and get lots 
of 'you can't hit that from here' messages.  My general plan was to charm 
a level 2-3 mob, drop Pot9 on it with my druid, then break charm and tank 
with the enchanter while my lowbie haste testing beastie whacks on the 
mob's back.  That way I could beat on the NPC for 15-20 minutes without 
interruption and get very accurate results.  You probably won't need that 
much accuracy, though.  Just a minute or two should be good.

Then, edit the logfile, taking out all off-hand swings and double attack 
swings (the ones with identical timestamps!) And other miscellaneous junk 
like procs.  Then, count the number of swings in the file (either by hand, 
with a parser, or a word processor with a feature that will count 
occurrences of the word 'slash').  Divide this number minus one by the 
time difference between the first and last timestamps.  This isn't your 
actual hastedness, but it's your actual modified delay.  Provided you use 
the same weapons in the two cases, you can compare that number to tell if 
there's a significant difference between the normal-haste case and the 
uber-enc haste case.

In general, I think spending 40K+ on any one item is really really really 
extreme.  You might look also at some lesser known items that might be 
significantly cheaper and droppable on FV.  These lists are a bit out of 
date, but ya might spot something. :)

The Shadowy Assassin Sash might be a middle ground.  I think, when it 
shows up, it goes for 6-8Kish on normal servers.

Hmmm there's a thought...  How much does Eyepatch of Plunder go for on FV?  
The clicky effect from that would stack with your FBSS, giving you 42% 
haste in the event there's no haster in your group...  Similarly, Belt of 
Marvelous Visions would get you to 52%.
