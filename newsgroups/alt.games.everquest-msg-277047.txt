Ah, but the problem disappears if everyone's harvesting like mad, as the
nodes will just respawn and everyone will, in exchange for the effort of
locating the node, harvesting, and deleting excess resources, have an equal
chance of getting a reward. As things stand, the reward appears at a
different place to the site where the labour takes place; thus the poacher
has a competitive advantage over the harvester... they can simply run around
and around until they see the "?", without worrying about the time
harvesting takes, the inventory management problems it causes, etc.

I can't see any problems i everyone harvested and if everyone's hunting
moths and going through the nodes to get them, then there's more moths for
everyone; it's win-win, except for the people selling them for absurd
amounts. It's a level 10 quest after all.
