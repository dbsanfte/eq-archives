Remember back 10-15 years ago when these things that looked like little 
LP's came out, only with music on them and you stuck them in a different 
player.  Software came on these small plastic discs.

Now, we've got these things that look like CD's, you only see movies on 
them and stick them in a different drive.

See any parallels?
