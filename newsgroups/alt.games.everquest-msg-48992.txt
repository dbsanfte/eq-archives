Here's the non-armor quests that appear to be working that
www.allakhazam.com knows about...these are faction-types...there are other
non-armor quests but you'll have to look them up for yourself. :P
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1203 - easy but apparently the
quest person despawns
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=982 - the helm quest
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1072 - another that appears easy
but takes a long time
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=969 - for a weapon but appears
to be pretty easy, though probably not something you'd do over & over
