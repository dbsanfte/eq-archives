Unless you feel like putting it in your mainhand slot (and you really
shouldn't, as there's a lot better stuff statwise to put in there..)
you'll need to give up an inventory slot to put your SoTF into.  From
there you can hotkey it, and right click the staff.

It's a great tool tho', makes judging kiting distance a breeze.
