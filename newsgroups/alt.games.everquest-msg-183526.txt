In the early days of EQ some cards had gamma supported and others 
didn't, so the problem is certainly familiar.  It still happens to me on 
one machine that is running a 32MB ATI Rage 128 Ultra (Chip type: 
RAGE128 PRO II, (AGP 4X/PCI)).  WinXP refuses to let me update the video 
driver, so I haven't been able to try that.

I have never seen this happen with a machine running a GeForce card, so 
if updating drivers doesn't fix it, you might want to change cards.
