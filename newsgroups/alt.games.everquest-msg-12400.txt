I recently bought the EverQuest de luxe edition (with Ruins of Kunark
and The Scars of Velious ) from Amazon and was very pleased that it 
had the tutorial after comments I had read in this newsgroup about 
some people finding that it was`nt included when they bought the
programme.  

However I did think it was a little short and left quite a few things 
uncovered. I am definitely not looking forward to grouping as a druid
as I have no idea how I can keep check on other character`s HP or
whatever to know when to heal them, or would I have to wait until they
ask?.

I think most of us have been watching enough American western films over
the years to know about critters :-)))
