Well, in a word, you are screwed.  You needed to do this a few months ago
before they nerfed smithing trivials.  You could have hit 175 with banded
armor.  Now, your option for vendor bought smithing materials is Ornate
Chain.  You can hit 162 with Platinum Ornate Chain.  After that, Fine Steel
is probably the easiest.  Both involve making intermediate items.  Fine
Steel also involved farming for pelts and spiderling silks.
