Did anyone else have trouble tring trying to log onto the main server
Thursday Morning?I went Sony's EQ homepage and there way an average of 600
people online in each server,as far as status goes.I couldn't log on at
all.We had a group going and we lost a member to the great LD.She couldn't
get logged back on and her and a friend where on a network,So we knew she
was having trouble. The group camped,thinking we may have a bug and now none
of us can log on at all. Just curious to see,If anyone else had trouble?
