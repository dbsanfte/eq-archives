As I recall, the figures were:-
1hs ordinary bonus : (Level-25)/3 - (Rounding down any fractions)
So at 28 you'd get +1, 31 +2 etc.

2hs ordinary bonus : (Level-25)/2 - (Rounding down and fractions)
So at 27 you'd get +1, 29 +2 etc

Copeland (does a lot of collating war info <g>) has more info than I can
ever give on this subject =)

A
