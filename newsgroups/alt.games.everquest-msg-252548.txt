Well, it's a proven model because it's well known that there are plenty of
players out there who are willing to pay for this type of game. The
interesting and unanswered questions are how many other players out there
would pay for something different and how many of these have been lost
because of this model, and how does the size and economic power of that
group compare to the one above?

Yep, I remember when Insurance was broken and the amnesty was in effect, and
then when it was turned back on. It makes a difference. SWG epitomizes to me
the game that tries to be all things to all people. Infinite character
mutability (hell, you can even change your starting attributes),
simultaneous mixed consensual PvP and PvE environment, mission-based
instanced adventure intermixed with dynamic and static spawns, schizophrenic
policy making on the topic of where the best loot comes from: players or
mobs; and a bizarre combination of instantaneous intergalactic travel with
some ridiculously hard to get to spots. Some of these options are nice to
have, but the game loses a lot of its personality because of it,
particularly on the character issues.

Yeah, I think so. I haven't really check out "There", I got the feeling from
discussions with players that it's the AOL of MMOGs and after playing The
Sims Online, I'd had enough of that. ;-) City of Heroes is on the
serious-MMOG side of the scale, but closer on the cusp than any of the other
big MMOGs.

The thing that the Sims Online did *right* was that it went beyond letting
you customize your home. SWG gives you great customizability in your home.
Hell, I paid an interior desiger a million credits to design the Ultimate
Home for my Master Weaponsmith (who was filthy rich). She spent weeks and
hundreds of thousands of credits making the most gorgeous furnishing and the
most elaborate design and in the end, I had an incredible palace, a showcase
of the game's ability to create a beautiful home. But who ever saw it? LOL,
why would anyone want to come over and look at your house? They did it as a
courtesy, and occasionally you'd have some meetings there and it might
provide a social environment while everyone was waiting to go hunt, but
mostly there was no reason to visit anyone's house and so these elaborate
constructions wound up all dressed up with nowhere to go.

What TSO did -- in addtion to giving you oustanding tools a la Sims for
creating your house -- was give you a great system for bringing people TO
your house. All that work paid off with a ladder system that actually rated
popular homes on the basis of how many daily visitors they had, and the game
offered tons of ways to attract people TO your house, and you got paid
credits for the number of visitors to your house. I had the most popular
Cooking Academy on the server because my place was well-designed, beautiful
to look at, highly functional, lots of fun and as a result turned into a
social gathering point where people could level and meet others of their own
kind in a fun, good looking place. THAT is a good use of personal real
estate.

Now, TSO sucked as a game, but man, they sure got that element right. No
other MMOG that I know of has ever approached that level of value with
personal real estate.

> I'm still not completely sold on instanced zones being the only way to go.

I like the idea the first time I saw it in Anarchy Online, but opinions are
pretty divided on it. This is one case where I think SWG made the right
choice being schizophrenic, offering a combination of both instanced and
static combat arenas. Both have their benefits and if you can design a game
world where it makes sense to have both, that's fine.

> Thing I hate the most about Final Fantasy. Everyone looks the same.

Have you taken a look at City of Heroes? Love it or hate it, this is a game
that takes character customizability to new highs and in the 2 months that
I've been playing, I've yet to see two players who look alike (unless
designed to, like the characters my wife and I play).

> The biggest problem, imho, with the SWG system was not the flexibilty, but
> the ease of swapping around.

Well yeah, you can regard "flexibility" as a compliment or as a sin, and in
the case of SWG it's precisely that ease of swapping that gives it both the
"flexibility" and simultaneously robs characters of any enduring identity.
