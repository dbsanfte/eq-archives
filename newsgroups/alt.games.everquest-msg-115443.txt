...and started crying, or at least seriously depressed, no doubt.  Man, what
a sucky situation to be in to have no freaking clue how the hell she was
going to even recover her corpses, let alone all that xp!

Unless you have a core group of 59+ (including at least 1 cleric, with
extragroup healing help) you're going to need a hell of a lot more healing
than what they had.  Faydedar isn't that tough, but he is when you're
talking about Faydedar newbies!

Yeah, Fay's aggro range is rather wide.  Binding by firepot room or
chessboard would be a hell of a lot smarter (is there a batwing dealer
anywhere in TD? If so, that'd be even better).

At least your wife is a lot smarter now...to know when to run like hell away
from a doomed fight before it starts. :p
