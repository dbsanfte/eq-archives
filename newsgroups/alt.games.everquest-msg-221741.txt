    You mean other classes can heal? Wow!

    Seriously though, anything a full group with a cleric can do, sooner or
later some psychotic shaman and SK team will do, with ever decreasing
numbers of support crew. And until shamans get nerfed it isn't going to
stop - although people seem to be talking more about nerfing SK's.

    Always makes me wonder what the hell is going on when one class has an
FT30 AA and people are screaming to nerf the guys who only just barely made
it to comparable viability as a class, and can only with 100k minimum worth
of gear and 20 AA's. Oh wait, shammies don't threaten warriors.
