Yup. The people you hear claiming they're no good for gaming either haven't 
used one in that capacity for years, played on a really cheap model or are 
just repeating what someone else has said. 

It used to be true that the ghosting and such was prevalent, but I've 
played EQ on my laptop for a couple of years now with no performance issues 
at all. I would expect even better performance from a desktop LCD.

Not only is the performance acceptible, the image can quite likely be 
better.
