It occurs to me with the advent of PoP that I can start an Ogre Warrior and
NOT have to level him in the Feerott.  This makes me very happy since that
zones absolutely bites.  Anyway, wondering where I should take him.  Since
he's gonna be dealing with Faction for the rest of his life I plan on taking
him to High Hold Pass from 13/14-17 or higher until I'm at least Dubious to
the guards in the keep so I can hunt with him there later.  But I'm
wondering if there is another good spot I should take him to from 2-13/14 or
so where I could begin work on faction.

My journeys in the game seldom take me near Faydwer, so not planning on
going there.  Anything I could hunt that would make my travels through NK
later on a little safer?  Don't really care about loot (slightly twinked
warrior) or even experience, since the first 10 levels go by so fast anyway.
Just looking for any suggestions of what will make my life easier in the
long run at the beginning.  Thanks.
