Perusing through Lucys spell lists, I saw a level 19 druid spell called 
"Lightning Call". I have never heard of this spell, nor seen it for sale on 
any vendors. I checked Allakhazam, and it was listed there as well. A 
google search shows it to be an EQOA level 14 spell. Is it possible that 
this was a test server only spell, and never made it live?
