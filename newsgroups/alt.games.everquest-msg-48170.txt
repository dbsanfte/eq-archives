I kinda like the new server , playing there as a high elf enchanter being
lvl 5 now , server is way to crowded at the moment but that will be back to
normal soon , 1 thing i realy hate is that there is no /ooc chat channel at
all , now people use the /auction one kinda annoying
Look me up sometime my name is Elander
