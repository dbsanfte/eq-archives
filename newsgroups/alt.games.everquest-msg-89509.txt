Look for Janam and Rebby quests- starting in East Freeport. They will
help you be able to shop throughout Freeport.

Kill orcs. This will help you bank in North Freeport.

Then when you get bigger, you can trash the E/W Freeport faction by
hunting guards.

You are Evil. Enjoy it.

Think of where you can not go as a lighty. You can probably go there
now. Think of where you can go as a lighty. You're probably KOS there
now. Con everything.

Consider which factions you chose to ruin- I know one necro who
deliberately trashed all factions. Can you say never able to bank? Silly
necro. There's nothing wrong with strategically getting someone to like
you. Jakugg a troll and Tiru a dwarf hunt together a lot- there are
actually three banks in the old world that we both can use- High Pass,
Paineel, and NFP. I'm still debating with myself if I want my necro to
bother with High Pass. Probably not.
