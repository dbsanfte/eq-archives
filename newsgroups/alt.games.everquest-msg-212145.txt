Well, my suspicion about how things were working would be way off if
you were _not_ working position properly, so I asked just to be sure.

No luck required, can't speak to the size of the sample, procs
could do it easy. You did say you were fighting undead and Paladin
gets a proc'ing buff that does a 273dd vs. undead, so it would be
easy for a Paladin to get ahead of you in total hate from time to
time.  But if you were both positioning yourselves to try to keep
agro on you he could get somewhat ahead without the mob turning on
him due to the big proximity modifier most undead have, and that
would give some hate for you to overcome with a successful Taunt.
I have always used Taunt (when tanking) if I see a slow/snare/dot
from a caster or Ranger, just in case (especially resisted Shaman
slow, that has got to be the biggest hate hit I've ever seen).

A good high-end Warrior is a more complex beast than the 40ish guy
you were grouped with, he'll likely have hate-boosting gear and
certainly have some sort of high hate weapon.  It's probably easier
to test hate/agro/taunt around L40 (of course, then you'd wonder if
there are any hidden rules changes at high level, can't win for
losing I guess).
