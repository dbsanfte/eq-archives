There it is in a nutshell.  The overwhelming majority of the players
take the path they believe is easiest.  Since most people seem inclined
to take hearsay as truth it doesn't take long for the rumor mill to
convince nearly the entire population that X is the "best" place to
be at Y level range so that X is shortly overflowing with characters
in Y level range along with all those desparate Y-5 twinks trying to
get in on the "good" thing.  Since VI seems committed to limiting the
game to a very small number of "X-type" locations that can support more
than a couple groups there is nothing out there reducing the crowding
of the "X zones".  So, with the "X zones" overcrowded, and most anybody
in an alternative zone either a committed soloer or part of a close-knit
and clannish "regular group", unless you're a member of the desireable
class du jour the whole damned game is solo or byog.  So much for
"encouraging grouping".
