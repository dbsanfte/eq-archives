Check out the gazebos (by the locked doors) in CoM. All the mobs
should be dark blue till at least 53, almost all undead, and nothing
runs. 

Veksar might also be a nice solo option if you can do the first few
undead. I think all those are single pullable and should be blue to
you.

Would it be easier to break in from the bottom? IE: starting at the
chardokB zone line. Not sure how doable it is at 51 but I've done the
run down nekkid on a CR at 65 and don't have LoH. 

BTW, always enjoyed your stories. Not only are they a good read, but
they always remind me why I don't want to join a raid guild <g>. 

Rgds, Frank
Run into the fort and jump off the first bridge, you'll loose whatever
train you picked up at that point (at least for a while :p) and the
slaves at the bottom won't agro. Take the short route to the
Bridgekeeper, jump off there. Look for the waterfall, run through and
zone into CharB.
