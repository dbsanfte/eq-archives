Very very few people ever "fell for" it. A great many more people were of
the untutored opinion that someone -would- "fall for" it, and thus _posted_
it trying to catch them; the latter type of person is still present in
great quantities, alas. Dave Rhodes hasn't been a feature of the
Make.Money.Fast posts/emails for some time now, but they're still the same
old scam. (The same sort of people who mail/post these are the types who email/
post to everyone they can reach about their amazing product that they're sure
you want to hear about, if that helps you categorize them mentally any...)
