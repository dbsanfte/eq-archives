}In the face of that, a 30-meter telescope sounds quite achievable... 

Oh, in fact, it must be the CELT, linked from the same page there. :)  
First off, the webpage is hosted at the same domain as my dad's email 
address, and second, when I click on working groups, I see about 5 names 
I've heard my dad mention in passing, and my dad's old boss's name, and 
the name of a guy I used to work for in Berkeley this one summer.  Didn't 
realize the mirror was gonna be quite -that- segmented.  But that should 
make the adaptive optics thingy work better.
