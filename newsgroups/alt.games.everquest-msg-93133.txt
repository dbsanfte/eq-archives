    Our (cleric) Offense skill cap is 200 - it's our weapon-specific skill
caps that are 175, like 1HB. We can't hit the broad side of a barn, which is
why the Luclin trend of giving casters weapons is so amusing. Our wizards
flail away with their proc staves in XP groups just to fool around (and so
they can crit with the proc and wow the crowd).
