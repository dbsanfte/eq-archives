<<<<<<<<<What're you still doing here?

You said you were leaving .. so leave.

Crash>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I'm still here because I'm eagerly awaiting your answer to my question and if
you can answer it adequately I'll be happy to leave.  How does me and my
friends getting a KEI adversely affect your gaming experience???  You do
everything but answer the question because you can't.  Me and my group have no
affect on your game.  You just don't want anyone to have more fun than you did
or for it to be what you consider to easy to level.
