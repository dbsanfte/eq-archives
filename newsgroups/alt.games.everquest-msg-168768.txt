Some FV MOBs see invis, or so I was informed before my first terror-stricken
run through the zone.

But "Hug the wall and run like hell" is good advice. I escorted a level 2
gnome through FV (for a wedding, allegedly) and they arrived safely.
(They did die in LOIO when, not knowing the zone well, they strolled
casually through the goblin ruins.)

Now that I think about it, it's remotely possible that was a GM event. It
seems unlikely that a level 2 gnome would be attending a wedding, and LOIO
would be a *really* strange place for it.
