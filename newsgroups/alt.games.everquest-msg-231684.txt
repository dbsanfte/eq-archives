Actually it does. Its called "The Labor Theory of Value"

The value of any commodity is determined by the socially necessary
labour time that goes into its production. The term �socially
necessary labour time� is used because the labour time required to
create a commodity depends on the society's levels of technology and
craft. In this theory, commodities should in principle be exchanged in
the market place for prices that exactly correspond to the necessary
labour time embodied in them. When a commodity is exchanged- or sold -
for more than its labour value, a surplus value is realized. This
theory of value provides the foundation of the claim that labour is
exploited in a capitalist society: the capitalist, through the power
of capital ownership, is able to pay the worker less than the market
value of the commodities produced and the surplus value is captured by
capital and largely re-invested to augment the means of production.

Translation: 

The only factor that should go into the given price for a commodity is
fair compensation for time invested. I.e. selling a LQ pelt for 500pp
just because someone is willing to pay for it, rather than expecting
fair compensation for the 15 seconds it takes to hunt, kill and loot
that pelt. 

Price gouging has never been an acceptable form of business practice.
