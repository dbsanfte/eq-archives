If you group does more damage to the creature than any other
group (and I'm using "group" generically here, think of a solo
fighter as a "group of one"), then ANYONE in your group can
instantly loot the mob, no matter who in the group did what
amount of damage (or even none at all).

If you ever get the "you cannot loot that corpse now" message,
it means some OTHER group did more damage to the mob than your
group did.  In that case, the other group has exclusive looting
rights to the corpse for two minutes.  After that, anyone can loot,
even people who just wandered by after the fact and had nothing
at all to do with the kill.

Also, corpses with anything on them (cash or items) vanish
after eight minutes from the moment they were killed (unless
someone loots them empty before that, of course).  Very
high-level corpses last longer, but that's another story.
Corpses with nothing on them vanish within about 20 seconds or
so.
