Beware,didnt find much love for a similar statement here some weeks
ago,some people here seem to think its reasonable to throw out 1000
Euros for a new computer for just one game.They argued  I can play
Half life 2 ,Far Cry and such crap with a new pc too,lol.
For me it was the reason number one *not* to play EQ2,while there is
at the same time a competitor which makes much better use of  "old"
hardware.
