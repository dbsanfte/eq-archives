I  have never had a resist to Pacify. I've heard it may have to do with a
high CHA and  mine's relatively high.

I have pulled before -- usually when I can't trust the rest of my group to
do it. I usually pull them back and root them.

As you said it is a bit of a problem since you do have that initial aggro.
