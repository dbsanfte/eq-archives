The gear for pet canni is cheap, and for anyone without
Suspend minion used only occasionally, so it can be carried
around in a pack.  

I usually use it after the first round of summoning during
the day to go FM, and after a rez or after a near group wipe
(which implies I'm oom and have a nearly dead or dead pet).

However, this is *MARTIN* we're talking about.  I expect
this mage to level very fast compared to, say, me.  Once
you're 64 the first 8aa go to suspend minion and then you
can put a fully buffed/equipped pet away (about 3 secs) 
pet canni to full and unsuspend pet.

Burnt Wood Staff - R-click cinderbolt, cast time 13.5
seconds.  Advantages, cheap (got mine for a trade worth
6k) and the damage bracer affects it.  Disadvantages -
LINE OF SIGHT (BLEAH), NO STAT 2HB (DOUBLE BLEAH).

BoBC off Velk - R-Click Shock (magic based) 18sec
cast, 600+ dd.  No LOS needed but a very long cast.

There's a sceptre - let me see if I can find it on
Allakhazam ......

Better than BoBC (except on fire resistant 
mobs) because the faster cast time allows for
choices in mixing regular nukes with staff
nukes.  Better than BWS because - no LOS,
faster cast, higher sustained DPS VASTLY
better stats.

Thing is, I'm not sure someone who levels as
fast as you will see the best return from these
items.  Once you can suspend and pet-canni, there
is no reason to mix r-clicks with regular nukes,
you just nuke as much as aggro allows and suspend/
pet canni to full during the pulls.

Heh, can't believe I might actually have something
useful to contribute to you two (allow me my 
illusions PLEASE  :)


Oh, and I drool at the thought of the Scepter :)

Currently I mix a steady stream of Staff bolts
and SoFB while sitting on a horse - manage about
70+ DPS on Crystalline golems from nukes, plus
my pet (60+ DPS), not bad for a 61 mage with 2aa
and gimp gear :-P
