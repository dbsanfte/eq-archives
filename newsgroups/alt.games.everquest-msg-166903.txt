You can still sort by population at the server select screen.

Morel Thule travels between 1/3rd and 2/3rd way down the list depending on time
of day and week and other factors I can't begin to guess at.  If you wanted to
select a low population server to move to or start an alt on, the trick would be
to look at the population sort a few times during your normal play hours, and
pick one thats consistently near the low end of the list (right next to the PvP
servers, the least popular in the game almost without fail, any hour of the day)
