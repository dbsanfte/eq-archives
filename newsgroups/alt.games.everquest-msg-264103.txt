Yes, they changed that rule right about the same time the first of the Jedi 
was ready to hit the permadeath wall.  They eventually implemented a system 
where death counts were on a timer.  X many deaths in Y amount of time would 
result in loss of a skill box, or some such.

I never did unlock a Jedi after mastering about half the professions, so I 
never got to personally see how it worked (though two of my guild mates were 
Jedi by the time I left the game).
