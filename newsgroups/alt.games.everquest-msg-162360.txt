Let me put that another way, I don't think much of that method of making
cash and therefore don't agree that it's a class nerf. The money can still
be made from desperate people not wanting to wait for Spires or needing to
get somewhere fast.

Windblade is limited to level 56+ and even with the weapon I doubt a Warrior
matches a 56 monk.
Hmmm Iksar Warriors have Foraging skill, too, are they meant to solo?
I agree there is now no reason for the weight penalty on Monks, it was there
as a balancer but turned out not really to be much of one, it may as well be
dropped, in light of the current change.

That warrior had to be twinked beyond recognition or a player that has been
real fortunate in gaining some excellent equipent. There is no way my 52
Warrior could solo Blues, sure, with all the buffs from my Enchanter and
Druid he could but on his own steam, not a chance...As for your Griffon
situation, unless it was half dead I would be either running for zone or
running to a safe spot to die, you get to FD...damn that sucks, you didn't
get the fun of ending up at your bind point, naked.

I doubt any class was designed to solo, players just found effective ways to
use their spells or abilities. Verant have always maintained that the game
was specifically designed to promote grouping the fact that this actually
makes life hard for the casual player has come to Verants attention, which
is why they have made travel so much easier, getting around Norrath was one
of the greatest time sinks there was, funny that with all the easy travel
now, Norrath and it's moon seem a much smaller and less impressive place.
