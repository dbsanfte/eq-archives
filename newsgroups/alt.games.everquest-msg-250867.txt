Amiga.  C64 was 6510-based (think 6502 with some extras) and Amiga was
68000-based.  Very different machines.

There was, in fact, a 16-bit version of the 6502 (for lack of a better
way to describe it), which Apple used in their Apple //gs.  I forgot
the part number though, sorry.

The theory does not necessarily match the reality.  Some old software just
won't work.  An obvious example would be TSR's (Terminate and Stay Resident
programs).  Yes, okay, I picked the easy example, but there is more main-
stream software from the old DOS days that won't work on Windows XP too.

That being said, XP is *remarkably* backwards compatible.  I can play most
of my old DOS games on XP without a hitch.  But XP is not 100% backwards
compatible with DOS.
