Will donate means "your time and energy are worth something, and I
respect that"

Please means "I am a begger... but a polite one"

Plz means "I know I'm supposed to be polite but the extra three letters would
be too much energy to expend on you"

SOW me means "I am the center of the world, do as I command"

Hail (name) means "I am not only the center of the world, but need to
expend the least possible effort, and H is a single keypress. I'm sure
you know what I want and are eager to provide it"

List in decending order of respect, in case you hadn't figured that out.
