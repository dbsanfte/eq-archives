Abandoned Orc Shovel, its a two handed blunt thats 4/28 or so.  Which is 
of course pretty lame damage output, but actually on a par with the 
stuff I'm using in this "lets see what I'll be able to do on a 
progression server", but the real point is that its pretty fast for a 
2hb, so you can use it to train the skill up faster in anticipation of 
using something 20/40 or so on, later.   Anyway, its free, a ground 
spawn item, and of course it has the shovel graphic, which always makes 
an interesting picture.

To get yours, go to Lake Rathe, the orc camp is the second one 
counterclockwise from RM, or the second one clockwise from SK.  Two 
orcs, both dark blue to my level 15 and easily slain, or you can sneak 
or invis past them, pick up the shovel and then die, if you're under 
level 6 you'll just get transported back to bind with all your gear intact.

It does sound like heaven for a soloer, which just about everyone is at 
low levels in this day and age.  But useless for the purposes of my 
current experiments, which are about getting ready for the Progression 
servers to open; these zones shouldn't be in the game until what, OOW? 
Figuring 3 months minimum per expansion, thats... two years away?
