That remains probably the most irksome design flaw of the game as it
is today.  It's just stupid of them to have built things so that having
a half-competent knight with half-adequate gear as MA gives 100% agro
control, while a top-of-the-line Warrior with excellent gear simply
can't come close to reliably shielding you in that situation.  It's not
that it is inherently wrong for the knights to be 100%, or for the
Warriors to have to struggle to gain agro, but it is very wrong to have
both be true.  It used to be very difficult for knights to compete with
Warriors as tanks, they couldn't take as much punishment and did less
than half as much damage.  With the way agro management games out in
PoP they've managed to turn that on its head.
