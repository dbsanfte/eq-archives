A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the
name jennaii@aol.comnojunk (Jennaii):

Jennaii this is twice in two posts you didn't read the context of what
you were replying to. There were no PoK books when it was put in.

Do you even know what you're arguing? You're supporting what I said.
Though I don't think Velious was a particularly good example of the
casuals being catered to (and so I didn't focus on it like the later
expansions), it did have its points that helped them out, and you and
the bozo I replied to are unwittingly providing us with them. Kunark
had one or two casual bones too; the outdoor easy cycle was
implemented because a certain subset of people wanted more higher
level outdoor zones with large wandering populations - sounds perfect
for the soloing casual who can't find time to group, doesn't it?

Look, I'm sorry if a thread over a hundred replies long confuses you
to the point you no longer even try to keep track of what's being
said, but that's not my problem, okay? Start keeping up.

There is no point going to Shadowhaven after PoK was put in.


>>>But don't let facts get in the way of your religious convictions.

Piss on that. Those things were great things for casuals whether you
want to admit it or not. But if seeing the truth in how much EQ has
changed for the better for the casuals gets in the way of your
whining, feel free to continue to complain.

Of course, now that it's gone on so long and you whiners have
complained so much without acknowledging what was given even the devs
are turning a deaf ear to you.....
