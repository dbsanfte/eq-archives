I was clever enough to know the player makes the character not the
gear back then. I didn't camp shit like that, no need.

I upgraded from two combine scimitars to two brazen brass kilijs while
in my 30s in prekunark. And damn straight it was fun. Even earlier, I
had a druid who never bothered to upgrade equipment at all. That was
fun too.

Of course everyone else had sucky equipment too. Was more social and
everyone depended on each other more, and you could really distinguish
yourself with good play, something much harder today.
