The rotation system on EMarr is not that bad.  It is one that was agreed on
by a number of guilds, not imposed by one.  The guilds have 24 hours to take
down "their" mob, at which point it defaults to the next guild on the
rotation.  The guilds must kill the mob on their own, no outside help
allowed at all, and if the consistantly fail to take it down, they are
dropped from the rotation.  The rules for getting into the rotation are
spelled out, and are not unreasonable.  The only issue I have with it is
that it does not allow for an alliance of guilds to be in the rotation.
