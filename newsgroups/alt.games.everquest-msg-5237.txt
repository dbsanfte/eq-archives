I am so happy that you managed to enter CC and have a result, I and a friend
of the same level have been gaining excellent exp there on and off for the
past few weeks and a lot of good lot for our lvl 30 (Now 35). Unfortunately
this dungeon has now been taken over by a constant army of farmers and is no
longer a place I can fight. So I have high tailed it back to the steady exp
of the Kunark hunting grounds.

Good luck for the future there on your server, Xegony is now impossible.
