I spent a few levels there hunting snow cougars. The gnomes are
definitely indifferent to cougars, because you can drag the cougars
right back in the middle of the igloos and they wont' react. However,
when not many people are hunting there, I have seen a pirate fighting a
cougar. (One of the outside perimiter gnomes.) I think the cougars are
just KOS to everyone and will attack the gnomes if they come within
aggro range. Once attacked, of course, the pirates fight back.  I
suppose a monk could have a field day pulling cougars into the middle of
the camp and FD'ing.  (Not that it would gain him anything but amusement
value, of course.)
