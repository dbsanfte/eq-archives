Been a while, Biz, but I seem to recall that you were playing either a 
druid or a necro up in those levels, yes? Either way, it should be prime 
territory for you if you are upper fifties to lower sixties. Check out 
the map at eqmaps.com. It's not very good, but gives you a feel for the 
zone layout. The hallways are very wide, and the mobs are pretty slow 
unsnared, and just stupidly slow snared. That means you can either root 
rot or kite back and forth in the short cross hall by the exit as you 
choose, and when root breaks during rotting, you've got room to maneuver.

You can pull to the crossways hall right by the entry and be within a 
few feet of the two zoneouts. Just check in advance to see if anybody 
has trained a bunch of mobs from Maiden's up to the zone line. Some of 
the see invis robes out there sometimes seem to get stuck at the zone 
line on either side and stay for hours. That can be an unpleasant 
surprise if you are zoning for your life and low on HP.

There are lots of static Centi Dators, non casters who don't move, 
positioned at the end of the first big hall and in the "Fallen Pillar" 
room at the end of it. They are great for either kiting or root rotting. 
Unfortunately, there are three or four Centi Patrollers who roam up and 
down that first big hall, the pillar room, and the two other halls off 
of that room. They are necros, and will often stand and chain cast necro 
dots, nukes, and snares/roots at you. I pull them anyway, but it usually 
just turns into a shootout. Either of your characters can heal 
themselves far better than my wizard, though, so it shouldn't be a 
problem. Every once and a while you'll see "The Protector" (guy in a 
robe, higher level, looks just like the shadow guardians) come on his 
rounds from way back deep in the dungeon up to near the entry. Oddly, 
the Centi's don't assist him, which is cool. He's a bit higher level, 
but also a necro NPC. Tougher fight, but has a couple of better drops, 
including the no rent gems for the cloak of truth quest.

If you have spotters checking for boss mobs and training to zone, watch 
your ass and stay off to one side. Usually the mobs are so slow chasing 
that they won't reach the entry by the time the checker zones, but a few 
of them from in deep will often stand around in the first hall 
annoyingly for a long time before they wander back.  These can include 
the Rubble Rouser, who is a boss guard. Don't pull him. We did it once, 
and he literally had more than 100K HP, quadded for over 200, is immune 
to stun, and rampages. Took nearly twenty minutes for us to root rot and 
nuke him down to death. (at which point he dropped *nothing*. Thanks, 
Rubble Rouser). He ate the necro pet like candy. So he's just not worth 
the time for the little bit more xp you'd get. Med up and give him a 
while and he'll eventually wander back to the Pit area.
