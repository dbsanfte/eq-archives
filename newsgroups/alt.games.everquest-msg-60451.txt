Didn't that ability rely on some relatively high level gear? It's also
shared with clerics to a certain extent? But yes, a well played paladin
is a huge asset to a grooup. I've enjoyed grouping with them much more
than I enjoyed playing my own.

But i'm a rogue now. I'm not worried if a paladin (or SK) does a bit
less damage than a warrior since I can make up some of the difference.

At least they're fixing LoH to actually scale. Though I would have
seriously though that it would be the cleric who's more likely to
survive (gate/camp/run) than the paladin. Certainly that's a more
desirable outcome :)
