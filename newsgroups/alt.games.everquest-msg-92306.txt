Greed? Hell if they thought they could get it, means that there is a number
of people who are paying it.

It is a business and to overlook an additional revenue source on a game that
is now three years old would be foolish.

WE, ie sane people, don't have to pay. Others want to, let them! it supports
our game while having no effect on us.

And the login server screwup on Monday shows that someone is paying, so more
power to them.
