Rarely compared to groups, yes.  But my feeling is that it is about 1/5
to 1/6 as rare, which is about the same for one person to score
something from a group dropped chest.  I worked on my disarm by soloing
green and blue orcs because the chests dropped often enough that I
wouldn't have to risk killing any groups trying to work on that skill.
