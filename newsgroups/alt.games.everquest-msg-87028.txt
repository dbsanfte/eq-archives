Yes, but at the level a lot of folks start exploring that tower (we were
doing it mid thirties to forty) lot's of guilds don't have a coffin
bitch yet. :-(

But yeah, you will have to call in the troops to get your ass back to
your corpses. We were just real chickens and tended to fight right next
to the exit mirror on each floor where possible. At the least we would
make sure the cleric was the keyholder and could gate out and sneak back
up using IVU which will at least get you to the third floor safely.
