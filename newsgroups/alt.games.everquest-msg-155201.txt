"Rod of Mystical Transvergence change update
The original plan we outlined for the Mod Rod change didn't have the
intended effect (you can see the original plans in the Development Update).
We've changed the plan a bit. The new changes (listed below) will be Live
tomorrow. Obviously we want to address the issues mentioned in the Update
("...perhaps single-handedly altered the balance of the end-game
encounter..."), and this change still does that. But at the same time we
wanted to allow mages to contribute using Mod Rods without reducing their
ability to contribute damage.

So, without further rambling from me, here are the changes that will be
going in tomorrow:

The Rod of Mystical Transvergence spell will be renamed "Mass Mystical
Transvergence". When cast, this spell summons a Rod of Mystical
Transvergence for everyone within 300 feet. This rod is no drop and contains
3 charges of Mystical Transvergence. Each charge restores 360 mana at the
cost of 450 health. A player may only use a charge from the rod once every 5
minutes.

Additionally, there will be a new "Rod of Mystical Transvergence" spell for
sale in the Bazaar. This is a single target spell that summons a rod with 3
charges of Mystical Transvergance. This rod has the same abilities and
restrictions listed above. This spell is a targeted summon that costs 400
points of mana to cast.

Thanks to all the mages that have sent in or posted suggestions on this
matter.

Alan "
