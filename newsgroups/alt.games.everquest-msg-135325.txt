I have spent less than 5 minutes all up downloading patches over the last
few days. Cable and a odd timezone rocks. As a Necro (pet class) I find the
new interface completely and utterly awesome. My only intitial reservation
was fixed by discovering my display options had defaulted back to 16bit
colour and hence everything looked like bleached out 2 week old dog shit.
Once I was back in the land of  32bit colour all was  rosey.

Patch trouble fellas? Set your alarm clock for 3am, start the patching and
by the time you wake up in the morning everything is peachy again. If you
sit down for a session of gaming and then find you are staring down the
barrel of a long patch you have no-one to blame but your own poor
organisation.
