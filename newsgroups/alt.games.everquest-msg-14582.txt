I read the accounts carefully and i inferred the following about each side.

1) several members of conquest knowingly used the res effect debuff to
prevent the uber mob debuff effect .
2) that they used coh to keep aggro on the clerics low , this clearly shows
that they did NOT intend for clerics to keep aggro high and sacrifice a
cleric every 10 seconds .
3) A uber mob got stuck in a pathing bug . This had no real effect .

The only one which can even vaguely be classified as a bug is the res effect
. Since they have never said its a bug its not one untill they do .

on the other hand.
1) Verant dissolved a whole guild , suspended and warned many people without
due process .
2) Most of those so effected where COMPLETELY innocent of any wrongdoing.
3) The penalty assesed on those guilty of using the undocumented feature of
the res effect blocking the slow effect was WAY out of proportion to the
crime if it was a crime at all.
4) They did not investigate untill they noticed that the appeal court of
public opinion was trying them again .
5) When they found out that they where in the majority wrong they did not
act to fix the situation but rather acted to try and minimize the dammage .

Verant once again turns out to have acted in a completely irresponsible,
highhanded and wrong manner . I wish I could believe that this was an
isolated or rare occurence but the track record indicates it is systematic ,
long term , and not improving.
