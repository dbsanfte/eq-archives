I consider that semi-valid.  It's not *easy* to get equipped for, and even
get to, some one-group content.  But it is possible.  I consider that
acceptable.

In the early game, the players were split into the Qeynos crowd and the
Faydark crowd.  There are many "old school" players that I never saw much
until Kunark because I did the Guk thing and they did the Sol B thing.  In
Kunark, everybody grouped together in Karnors/Sebilis, with a few doing
alternatives, but generally not without spending some time in
Karnors/Sebilis.  Velious spread people out the most I think, with
everybody's adopted hometown being different, though a lot did stay friendly
to the dwarves.  Luclin funneled the raiders into Ssra, but at the same time
spread them out to damn near all the zones (hate the shards, and I had it
easier than most).

PoP again separated people quite a lot, though also created the biggest
meeting ground ever.  LDoN threw together a lot of people.  GoD funneled the
raiders, everybody else stayed in PoP and LDoN, the raiders still came back
to PoP and LDoNs for most grinding though, PoK was still a meeting ground. 
OoW sent raiders all over the place like shard camps, but mostly into
instances which may or may not have been a mistake.  The grinding itself
took a pretty limited path.

DoN definitely made a new grouping place, but not where you would have liked
it.  The guildhall has created the new great divide, Velious style, but more
targeted.  It's no surprise that all raiders have DoN.  The group and raid
difficulty and rewards of DoN don't displace GoD or OoW ontent, so the
raiders hit it in bursts, usually when everyone is free at once or when
everyone is coordinated for the raid content.

Exactly, to start.  People will gravitate toward what they feel most
comfortable, or most enjoyable, to grind on though.  I find that most groups
of non-raiders doing PG named camps and RS are the type that, as mentioned
below, have bad schedules or whatnot but would make perfectly find raiders. 
There are some that land in WoS, because they feel safer, that qualify as
well, but there are a whole lot that don't.  The average quality of player
drops off dramatically, and I'm *not* referring to equipment level.  I've
had poorly equipped but skilled players in hard places, I can tell the
difference.  I'm sure you can too.

No shortage...  subjective term, so I'm not sure whether I disagree with
you.

And there's never been any doubt, among those who know such things, that all
raiding guilds have a "core" and "filler".  That's why I think only those
who are truly timezone challenged can really claim to not be able to raid
and have a valid complaint about their capabilities not matching their
aspirations.  Much like people say "it's a grouping game" when use that same
argument about wanting to solo better (fun to read monk boards sometimes), I
will now say "it's a raiding game".  Sorry.   =)

Sorry, you're playing the wrong game.  See above paragraph of mine for the
reason.  Not that you can't enjoy what you can access, because I believe
you can still get to it all eventually.  You just have to accept your
limitations and realize that instead of 3 or 4 expansions back you have to
settle for 3 to 6 expansions back.

I won't argue the reward part.  For me, it is minor.  Reference me passing
on a necklace thrice better than mine earlier in this discussion.  I
*really* like to raid.  Reference as well the "loot whores" statement even
earlier.  I also am aware that it plays a large part for some.  =)

It has nothing to do with being elitist.   Are you blind?  This is called
survival. Raiders need a critical mass of like-minded and like-scheduled
people to be able to progress.  The better the collection of skills and/or
gear, the farther you progress.  I believe the balance is tilted toward
skills as long as the gear is moderate, though I will freely admit that
there are minimum requirements to do certain content and not be frustrated
at your poor performance and possibly even a hindrance to the rest of the
raid.  That's no surprise.  It is achievable by a determined single-grouper
who wants to make the leap when he finds his situation more accomodating. 

For those that raid for the fun of raiding, your opinion of their percentage
of the population being unlikely to be influenced by mine notwithstanding,
the progress itself is the greatest quest.  You are aware of why the other
type do it.  =)
