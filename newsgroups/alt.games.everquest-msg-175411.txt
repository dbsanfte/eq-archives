Nope, that irritation is still there.  I find that a few targetted
"Hail"s clears it up immediately (target myself if nothing currently
targetted).  I, like you, see this most frequently when I start moving.

I can confirm that it doesn't appear to be an ISP/router problem,
2-boxing on one machine I will see it in one instance but not the
other.  The key word there is "appear" tho, I don't know what EQ's
datastream looks like, I can imagine an ISP/Router doing something
stupid with a series of identical packets at a constant time interval
(which is presumably what your machine is sending when you stand/sit
still for a while), and this then leading in some fashion to the
subsequent mini-LD effect.  I've certainly debugged software systems
with behavior far odder than that.
