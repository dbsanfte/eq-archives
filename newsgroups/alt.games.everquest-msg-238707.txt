Hmm.  I always rated Tak and MMC at about the same.  Guk and Mir  and
defintely the hardest.   Rujark is hit and miss.  Get a lot of the
casting goblins and it's gonna suck.

Another thing I noticed.  Finally got a couple MK's this weekend after
what seems like a month of nothing but Collects,  and we had a lot
more difficulty getting through them. Barely making the time limit,
even with massive dps.  (had a partial victory with 2 rngs, rogue,
monk as damage)  Course, we were missing a haster.  I think that may
have made the difference.

But don't be so hard on yourself as a puller.  I was pacify pulling as
a cleric in both dungeons, and we were keeping up fine.  I offered to
do it over a paladin in one, as he was getting a lot of resists and
consequent adds.  It can work well, but you have to be *vocal*. ( and
I usually skip pac on the one I intend to pull, just pacifying his
neignbors.)   And once the mob is in the 30% range or so, do a HoT to
the MT and then get the next set pac'd and ready to drop. You can keep
the kill rate pretty high by chain pulling.

That I have no advice on.  I'll usually stick to the bitter end, or
til its just not doable anymore.  Depends on how far the target is out
of reach.  I've pulled out some that looked like failures, and got
partials on others.  

But then agains, my friends think I'm a madman.  (I got a whole lot of
"stupid death" stories lined up.  Any favorites?)
