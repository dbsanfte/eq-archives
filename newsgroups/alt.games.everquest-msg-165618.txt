So far, I think my point has been clear to everyone, except
you.  They may not agree, but at least they understood the
point I was trying to make.

You seem to be the only exception.

I'll state it again, for the record: I don't think obtaining
rare items should involve unusually long camping sessions.  I
think they should involve multiple shorter duration camps
instead.  I think this would be more interesting to most players
and give more casual gamers a chance at the same kind of items.
