Well, I started playing on a Free trial CD from a PC magazine and
nothing else. which gave me a free month, which I've extended by three
months.

I would seriously recommend something similar, i.e. buy basic disc and
play classic everquest for a while. If you like it, then buy the
expansion packs.

Do a bit of internet searching on the different classes and races. the
more popular will have piles of web pages on them which contain guides
and tactic, how-to's, etc.

A dwarf warrior with all your extra points in strength might be an easy
one. 

You can have eight characters on each server, and there are 99 (?)
combinations of race and class (if you have all expansion packs)
possible. Try different ones.

Learn to use the internet. This was how I made sense of Everquest.
I use google for searching on everything http://www.google.com
Enter "item-of-interest everquest" (without the quotes)

I usually choose Allakhazm (sp?)
Also http://www.eqatlas.com  for maps and 
http://www.eqtraders.com for tradeskills.
