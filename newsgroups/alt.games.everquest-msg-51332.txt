I finished the BR quest. Yes, the weapon itself is not good as the weapon
been found in the expansion. Please be reminded that this quest is the very
first quest being launch out with the original EQ set.

It is a long and trouble quest, I totally agree, but it worth you take the
time and money (yes, it is costly) for the experience. Both experience point
you gain in game and the place, people you talk to for the quest (it is a
RPG). If you only look into powerful weapon, powerful armour, then you are
more or less develop your character as a twink. My rogue was redempted by
this quest.

Walter, you can start the quest at around level 25, but too bad you will not
finish that till you are high. And by that time, you should get better
weapon then the BR (I use BR as secondary weapon).
