Well, let's put it this way...  I have a level two Warrior
permanently stationed at the pool under the Flying Saucer in
North Qeynos.  Her name is "Fishpoacher".

And you're right about killing the fish giving HUGE faction
hits, Fishpoacher's probably killed no more than 40 fish
in her career, and she's already not only KoS, but to the
point where the faction messages now say "Your faction
standing with XXX could not possibly get any worse", with
TWO different faction groups.
