i tested that using a baby cleric (10) and minor healing.
a friend damaged himself and i casted minor healing:
he was healed for 30
i equipped on zaharns coronet and casted again for 33 HP
i added medicine totem and he was healed for 36 (maybe 35 i dont
remember exactly) notice here that i got message only about zaharn's 
in both last cases ! 
with only totem he was healed for 33 again.
my druid used them both for long with a medall alloy medallion and a
same type (mana preservation 2) ring and healed verry effective till
lvl 20 when he got book of obulus and removed coronet and totem
i have done no tests to be sure if mana preserv stacked too.
i remember i was very manna efficient and i was getting the usual
message only for the meddalion not the ring (it was the pok quested
fine antique ring i think) but i believe they stacked too.
i know that if you have 2 same type focus effect items - lets say mana
pres 1 and mana pres 2   the higher level item takes over ..
now at lvl 55 i use an obulus death shroud (mana pres 3) and i look
forward to an upgrade for my serpentine bracer (burning affl. 2)
The question is : if i have 2 mana peserv 3 items will they work
together as well?
and if i equip 2 burning affliction 3 items will they do more damage?
any help welcome :)

anyone has tested mage summoned focus items together with same style
:) focus items?
