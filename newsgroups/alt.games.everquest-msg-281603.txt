Every once in a while I skim the subjects in my spam folder to
see if my spam filter has put anything there that isn't really
spam.  The folder is divided based on what address the mail was
sent to; e.g., for mail sent to the AGE-FAQ mailing address I
tend to be watching for different sorts of subjects.  Sometimes
I'm amused by subjects that are clearly spam but that sound like
they could in fact be relevant to EverQuest, such as:

	Guaranteed Platinum! 
	
	greatly improve your stamina
	
	wanna play tonight?
	
	Don't forget your pet... 

But today I saw one that was so "on-topic" that it bowled me over:

	Finally a Patch that works!
