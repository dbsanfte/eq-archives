Except that royalty deals are *always* disfavored and frankly I remain 
surprised whenever I hear of anyone cutting such a deal. But you're right, I 
shouldn't have been surprised at this one. Not only because SOE isn't the 
brightest bulb in the box, but also because even Gates would cut a royalty 
based deal (and he has) when it opens the keys to the kingdom as this one 
threatened to do with TWO kingdoms.

<snip interesting analysis>

Yeah, once people start smelling the money and the compelling appeal of the 
recurring revenue model, the big players all move in and bring with them 
their more sophisticated and establised rules of engagement. Verant brought 
SOE, brought LucasArts, and now EA and Microsoft, after stumbling a little, 
are both in the game. Won't be long before all of the major entertainment 
properties in the world are playing this game. We're really just at the 
beginning of this cycle.
