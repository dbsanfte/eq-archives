	The idea of PvP should turn you off.

	It doesn't work in these kinds of open formats because the players don't
want it to work.  The majority of players aren't interested in giving their
opponents a fair game.  They just want to win.  That means attacking from
ambush, using overwhelming force, and cheating if possible.
