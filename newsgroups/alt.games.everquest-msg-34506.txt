  Explain to me exactly how he was "taken."  He was going to give the
items away anyway, it's not as if HE lost anything.  Any anger he has is
rooted in having been deceived angry because the person lied.

  I may not be a saint, but I don't lie to a person so I can take
advantage of their charity.  If you do, or ever have, I certainly
wouldn't want you in my guild.  Further, if the only solid first
impression I have of a person is negative, unless somebody I know is
willing to "vouch" for that character, I see no reason to give them a
second chance.  There are plenty of other guilds out there who can take
their chances with her.

  If that "one rotten thing" is the only testament I have to their
character, there's nothing else about them to "ignore."  As for "keeping
an extra close eye on them"... I'm not their parents, and I personally
am not going to expend the effort necessary in keeping an eye on them,
knowing that I can't possibly monitor their activity 24/7, knowing that
they may very well be continuing their poor behavior when I'm not
looking.

  Why take that chance?  I think it's a fair assumption that if the only
sample you have of a person's character indicates they are deceitful and
greedy.  Why let them in the guild, giving them the chance to put up a
facade of decency until their place in the guild is secure?  Give them a
chance to associate with the guild, make a few friends, only to create
discord when she does something else that is questionable or outright
wrong?

  But, hey, if you think it's best to open your guild to people who make
very poor first impressions, whose presence in the guild will surely
create friction with at least one member, so you can give them a "second
chance" to prove themselves--that's fine for you.  It just doesn't
happen to be the way I'd run my guild.
