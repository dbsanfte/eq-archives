Rosewhite talked with Velarte Selire, a very
recent addition to the courtyard of the Temple of
Life in Qeynos. He mentions that the plague in the
Karanas is destroying the crops. "Not only are the
farmer's livelyhood at risk but we who depend upon
their crops are as well. The city of Qeynos keeps
a rather enormous supply of basic rations on hand
in case of siege or war. However, we may soon be
faced with a shortage of other foods. This has
many merchants worried. Troubling indeed." A
similar concern is expressed in "The Antonican
Times", the newspaper sold by the new merchant
ouside the bank.

What is worse, newspapers in Rivervale, Freeport
and even Ak'Anon are predicting a vast food
shortage as the breadbasket of Norrath continues
to mildew. I've not heard from other cities, but I
would not be at all surprised if in the near
future, we are forced to either develop our baking
skills and hunt for our supper or turn to the
blackmarket for something other than rations.
