The answer.. should be obvious. He buys them from players in game,
sells them on playerauctions for cash, and then transfers the item in
game to the new buyer. As long as the money he spent to get the item
is less than the money he received for the item... he makes profit.
I'm also sure he has software programs like Access and Quickbooks and
what not to track transfers.. and if sophisticated enough has had
programs written to automate some of the out-of-game overhead. I.e.
inventory tracking programs.. which character has what, etc.

Oh please... if Sony employed a team of people to do this the word
would get out. If they get in the business they'll say so.. like in
the LA Times article. The main virtual traders in EQ are Jonathan
Yantis and IGE(a Hong Kong based outfit with a 100 person staff
dedicated to buying and selling virtual items in any mmorpg that you'd
like... check them out at www.ige.com.. you can even find out their
buy and sell rate for platinum on your server).
