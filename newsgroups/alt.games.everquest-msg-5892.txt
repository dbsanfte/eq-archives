It is a strict division, yes.

The guards in WC, EC, West Freeport, East Freeport and North Ro are all 
the same faction. If you are not kos to them, you can travel in these 
zones safely (however, there may still be other Knights of Truth NPC 
around in efp and wfp, but not guards).

North Freeport hasn't got any Freeport Militia, only the Knights of 
Truth. Being KOS myself with the Freeport Militia, as a result of 
killing too many guards, the Knights of Truth in North Freeport are 
amiably to me :-) But I cannot travel in the rest of Freeport without 
the guards trying to give me that LOADING PLEASE WAIT text.

If your general Freeport (east and west) is at least dubious, you should 
be fairly safe.
