The guild I am in is starting to look seriously at doing Grummus and Terris 
Thule.  I am interested in any information that those of you who have done 
them can provide.  In particular, numbers required, assuming mostly level 
65 people.  Most of the guild is equipped with a hodgepodge of Velious 
quest armor (thurgadin and SS), IV, a bit of NToV, Velks, BoT drops and 
other equivalent drops.

A number of us have participated in pickup raids on both of these mobs, but 
we are trying to get a good feel for how many folks we should be thinking 
about having on hand for the raids.
