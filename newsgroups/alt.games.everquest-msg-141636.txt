Most, if not all of the bank area mobs are blue at 60.   All of them can
drop armor.   (the drop rate is truly horrid though, even for Kael.)

None of the level 30 - 40 giants on the way to the bank area (from either
side) will drop armor though.

I've had the lesser see invis guards drop armor.  Only a few times though...
as I said, they seem to have the least chance... and even in the arena
fighting the Veterans, drop rates are pretty poor.

Vindi is a good source for armor. ; )   As long as all you need is a BP or
boots. ; )
