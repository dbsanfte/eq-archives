There are plenty of other zones that could be used for pick up groups if
there were enough people wanting to do pick up groups. There aren't, so
those zones (Howling Stones, Chardok, Sirens Grotto, Dragon Necropolis)
remain raid only. 

Ever since Velkators was upgraded to be better than Sebilis for exp and
drops, while remaining safer and in a more convenient location, then
Sebilis has been empty, at least on my server (prime time last saturday,
there was one guild group doing money bugs, and noone else). 

The extra people in Velk's weren't created out of thin air, they moved
from Seb. Add another zone that is easier and better loot than Velk's
(hard to imagine, I guess, but theoretically possible) and Velk's would
in turn empty out.
