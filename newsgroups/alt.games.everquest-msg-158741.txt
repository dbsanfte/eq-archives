Q: How do you make a small fortune from tradeskills?
A: Start with a large fortune.


OK, once you've acheived grandmastering in a useful skill you might be able
to start recouping the expenses, but it takes either a fair old time or the
aforesaid large fortune and then a whole lot of mouse clicks to get there.
