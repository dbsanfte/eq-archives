Which leads me to pose a question. Why do Norrathian spell vendors run
such poor shops? If I were in charge of a specialty shop, I'd make it a
point to carry every item my clients might be interested in. My poor
Barbarian had to brave the wilds of Everfrost Peaks and the heat of
Oasis to get spells. Do PoK vendors in the library carry all spells? If
they do, then I might brave the maze!
