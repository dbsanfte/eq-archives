Greetings,

I am Game Master Admin Jannaka. I am afraid that too much time has 
passed between the time you deleted the characters and now.  I will
not 
be able to return them to your account.  I wish you the best of luck
in 
your adventures.

Sincerely,
Amy McCrary
Game Master Admin Jannaka
Sony Online Entertainment

I stopped playing everquest in feb of 2002
at which time I was not intending on coming back<family reasons>
theyve 
been resolved and
A few weeks ago I decided to play again<upon reregistering I found the
one char i did not delete still on the server<the other 2 I had
deleted
characternames and levels were

Traecii Forrestwind  57 druid

tarkuss urukhai       46 warrior

Is there anyway to restore one or both?
even the naked chars would be ok
i spent about 130 days playing time building the druid and much less
on 
the warrior but all in all a HUGE investment in time
thanks
