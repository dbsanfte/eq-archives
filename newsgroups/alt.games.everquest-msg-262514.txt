All depends on your definition of "is".  =)

Iraq had and used "WMDs" (the chemical and biological kind) in the past. 
That's beyond dispute.  Honestly, considering what we learned in the first
gulf war (half of the Iraqi air force is in mothballs in Syria and Iran) I
wouldn't be shocked to find out that there were ongoing attempts to gain
"WMDs" (the nuclear kind, in addition to chemical and biological) that
haven't and may never be found out.

You should read what the middle eastern media publishes about the conflict
between Israel and the Palestinians as compared to what the english media
publishes.  Definitely make you a little less trusting of what the media
says (and I'm not talking about Al'jzzra, or however you spell that).

Iraq was a war we could win, with other reasons to invade.  Iran may be one
of those reasons.  Libya definitely was.  Nobody misses Sadaam.  Nobody. 
Not even the people most opposed to the war.  Iran would be a different
story, and we sure as hell don't want to invade North Korea until we see the
missiles in the air.

That's the result if we invaded Iran.  However, if we sit next door with
200k troops, Iran is a lot less likely to attempt anything (though granted,
we do need to get Iraq under control for that to carry maximum weight).

Clinton accomplished zero.  Zip.  Zilch.  Nada.  Add to that, he "defiled"
the presidency and his page in the history books will be the most amusing
and least informative of any president.

Reagan, agree with it or not, fought a war of words and economies, and won.

Bush isn't ranking real high right now, but he had a lot of things served to
him on a plate he didn't order.  Time will tell how the history books will
treat him.

Not that has any chance of becoming president, no.  I choose to not waste my
time on utter futility.

I don't, and haven't, agreed with any president on any issue.  Ever. 
There's always been a better (and seemingly obvious) means, and that's if I
even agreed with the ends.

As you've seen my opinion of Clinton, I can assure you that I think Dole
would have been a better president.  At the same time, I wonder why they
picked such a drab guy to try to run against the flashiest presidential
candidate ever.  It was doomed to fail.  America is a country "of the media,
by the media, for the masses", and pretty people sell.

Bush is going to get elected, because like what he's saying or not, he says
it and moves on it.  Decisiveness, even if you don't like the decisions, is
still an appealing quality for the Commander in Chief.

Now I know you're lying.  All women are certifiable...

That ought to be good for another 30 posts in this thread.   =)

Republicans have finally figured out that the media matters.  They already
knew they could buy anything.  2+2=4.  Now they have a news outlet of their
own.  I know you were talking about a more personal level, but that's where
the "claims to the contrary" stem from.

But I did get a tax cut.  Yeah, I got the $300 check, but I also got a
"raise" due to my withholdings being reduced.  Granted, not a large one, but
it was better than going the other direction.

Sure.  Your parents did it to you.  See Social Security and Medicare.  My
great grandmother never paid a penny to either, but received both for
decades.

Actually, this is one of those things that I don't agree with any politician
on.  Those programs, as they exist, should not exist.  Medicare by far being
the worse offender.

That's still a bit too socialist for my taste.  =)
