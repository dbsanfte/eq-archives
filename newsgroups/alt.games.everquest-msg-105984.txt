Sure it would, statisicly speaking.  Given a large enough sample, a 20% 
increase in attack speed WOULD reflect a 20% increase in damage.  Would it 
be EXACTLY 20%?  No, of course not.  But in a properly controlled test, 
the variation would be statisticly insignificant.

I don't know if he's *ever* wrong (I'm sure he is, we all are at some
