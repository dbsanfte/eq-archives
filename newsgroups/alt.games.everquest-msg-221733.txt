With 512MB there was a lot of cache draw, enough to cause significant lag in
high density areas and even some re-write lag in low populated areas. When
raiding on the Planes, this became a real hassle. Everything in the game had
to be turned down or off. Wife usually wound up looking at walls and floors
during raids. (BTW, she's the one playing the game, I'm the hardware guy
supporting her addiction.)

With the 1GB RAM in place, the game ran significantly smoother, even in the
Bazaar.

I's thinking about striping for performance. I've got a "server" box for
backing up stuff. This would be on an ASUS A7v266-E. With Athlon 2400+XP
CPU. Planned summer 2005 purchase will be an A7V600.

Hmmmm. was planning on a Seagate SATA 80G drive. It's 7200 but transfer rate
seems to be acceptable. It's also quiet (that's MY part of the equation).

Hmmmm. Texture caching is turned ON in game options. hmmmmmmmmm. lemme think
about this some more. Thanks for your comments.
