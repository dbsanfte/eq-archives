I expect that Muslims, who recognize Moses as a prophet, would have
no problem signing on with this one (or most/all of the others for that
matter).  I know this may sound sorta like a nitpick, but there are
an awful lot of millions of Muslims out there...

However, I am firm in my belief that religious symbols should have
no official place or sanction in a secular courtroom.
