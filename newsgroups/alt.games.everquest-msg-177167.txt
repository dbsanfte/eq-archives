Non existant. Best to try FV. Can be fun there. Role playing is not
everywhere but is respected.
On regular servers I always RP with the beggars and such. They are part of
the species so will always play games too

as above

hmm depends on your group/solo quest tradeskill playstyle

15 minutes. tradeskills some questing.
I wouldn't try fighting.

Again depends on playstyle.

Same as ever...But Guk Sola Mistmoore Befallan Najena are all empty now. And
no line ups for Jboots.

Most uber items then are vendor fodder now. Very easy to get get great gear
cheap.
As an experiment I started a warrior on Kane Bayle to see how much gear and
plat I could get fast.
In less than a week I had crafted and some items better than that like
Lozidal(sp) boots. All weapons with a proc and 5K in the bank. Only lvl 20
but focus was on plat.
I was amazed.

Customer service is slightly better. If you get in a jam it is possible to
get a restore but general rule of thumb.
It sucks when that happens and just get the levels back.

>

Yes and no. Penalty more leveled out and non existant under 10. But leveling
is way faster due to gear and great exp spots. The days of Lguk in banded
and bloodclaw are gone.

Fun is whereever you find it. It really depends on your playstyle and how
many friends you decide to make.
