I remember what a HUGE difference that made when I turned 35 with
my mage (and swore I'd never level another caster because I HATED
that book).  I was suddenly able to med while my pet tanked - and
my kill rate went way up.  I was safer and I killed more.

The other thing was, I finally found out why our druid healer was
OOM all the time (low 30's group).  I dinged 35 in that group, and
suddenly was able to see through the fights, and noticed the damn
druid up and running around through the entire fight.  He didn't
like not being able to see during the fight, so he didn't med.

It was altered game dynamics tremendously.
