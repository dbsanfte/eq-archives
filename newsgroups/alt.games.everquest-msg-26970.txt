That's what banks are for. If you want to change coin at a merchant you just
have to use your brain a little.
Buy a stack of something that comes to a little over a plat but that you can
also sell for a little over a plat back (rations for example)
buy stacks of 20 and you will use the lowest coin first so getting rid of
all your excess weight, then sell back in stacks, because a stack comes to
over a plat he will pay a 1plat back + change, keep doing this until all
your excess coin (or as much of it as possible) is platinum. Of course the
better your charisma the less you lose over the trades but the difference in
price is only really a matter of a couple of silver in most cases.
