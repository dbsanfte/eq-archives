I've seen allot of posts about the price increase to $3 more than the
current price.  Actually it's going up more than that.  The current cost is
$9.89 and it is going up to $12.95 total.

(Math lesson)

  $12.95  (Price as of April 25)
- $  9.89  (Price currently)
_______
  $  3.06  (Difference in price)


               0.309403437815975733063700707785642
           _________
$9.89 | $3.06

This is an increase of  30.9403437815975733063700707785642%

And we're not even considering other factors such as the difference in cost
of running the game back then vs. the cost of running the game now (a
difference and percentage increase/decrease comparison).
