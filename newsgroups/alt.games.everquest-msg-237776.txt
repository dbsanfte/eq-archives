Same bug.

Its happened to my bard so far in Oasis (on the ghoul of takish hiz
... took my like 40 minutes to chant it down to 5% (its got crazy
regen) and then it teleports... as a bard with accel and track it only
took me about 2  minutes to find it... and it was back at 100% health.
Did i mention its regen :p

And in stonebrunt, and in the OT, and in East K, and in OOT, and
shadweavers, and hollowshade...

If its zone specific its affecting a lot of zones.
