Personally, I *love* Agent. It's got a high learning curve; but it's
great once you get the hang of it.  Gravity is quite good too,
especially if you download graphics since it has a built in viewer.
Also, (and you'll probably think this is heresy since you're using
IE/OE /grin), the old netscape (4.xx series) had a pretty good
combined news/email feature, as long as you weren't trying to use it
to download multipart binaries. I used it for pure text groups until I
"upgraded" to the new Netscape and hated the changes they'd made to
mail and news.
