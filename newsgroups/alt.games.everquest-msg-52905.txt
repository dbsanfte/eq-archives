Ok, that should have been expanded on more. My bad, sorry. The point is,
the OP has already clarified that the mob was *not* at 25% health, but
rather was at 75% and that was just his funny way of talking about it.
As to your example, I've never tried nuking something that was more than
half dead with a huge nuke to see if I get xp, so I really couldn't
comment on it. Certainly sounds like fucked up coding if it's true, but
I wouldn't be shocked.
