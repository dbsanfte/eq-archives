I made my first 3kpp doing Crystal Caverns with my bard from 32-38. I'm
sure a 43 mage could do the same quite a bit faster.

I made my first 8kpp by foraging tradeskill stuff with my 24 iksar necro
in ldons: goblin bones, ice lichen, polished quartz, geodes, etc. I don't
recall if there are any foraging mages in the game tho.

My mage friends all swear by Twilight Sea. Farming the elementals for
essence of wind, lava rocks, and neat items off the named ones.
