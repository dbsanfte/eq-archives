As Bizbee already responded, it's most likely your ISP's news-server.  So
it's out of your hands.  The most you can do is report to your ISP about
your problem.  My ISP got sold a few months back and just recently (like 2-3
weeks ago) handed over the old domain name and added all subscribers to an
existing domain and since then the newsgroup service has more-or-less blown
goat.

If you make a post, check within a few minutes if it's there.  If it's not,
try pinging your news-server from a dos prompt.  Chances are the server
could be down occasionally (even though it shouldn't), and if this isn't the
problem email your ISP and tell them the chimps running their service can't
seem to get the news-server fleshed out properly.  You should at least
receive an obligatory response that may give you an idea of the scope of
their issues with said server.

Good luck,
SEAN...
