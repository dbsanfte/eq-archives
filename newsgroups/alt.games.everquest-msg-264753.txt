My spreadsheet's coming along nicely, for levels 1-9, anyway (focussed on
tailoring and chemistry).  Got a lot of material in, now able to figure
costs and grinding losses quickly.  For example, don't grind on Threadbare
Cuffs (I think it was) - you'll lose 12 pence per.  One of the others, I
forget which, loses you only 3 pence per sample made.
