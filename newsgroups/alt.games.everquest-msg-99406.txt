In addition to the petition automagically deleting that others have said, do
a / all GM and any guides or GMs ought to appear on the list (unless they've
gone /anon to investigate someone else's petition). If there's no one there
when you do a / all GM, odds are pretty good that you won't get an answer.

The perils of doing customer service with volunteers- they don't always show
up when they are scheduled to. Most GMs (the paid folks) work 3pm to 10pm
PST, 5 days a week. Whenever possible, petition then.
