Verant says EQ cannot be run in a window. I think their explanations
are sometimes almost plausible, but do not feel like running risk of
banning (my head is NOT as strong as that brick wall they have).

On the other hand, I am sure that there is a way to run two monitors
off one computer. I am also sure there is a way to have EQ run on one
monitor (full screen) and have your normal desktop on the other while
you toggle the keyboard and mouse between the two. Anyone know how
hard this would be to set up and/or if it would be a banning offense
if you got caught?
