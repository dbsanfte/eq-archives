No its RvR. You cannot attack a fellow realm mate. You always know who
the enemy is and you choose to engage the enemy when you want to by
going to the frontier.

Then your views represent the extreme and you know that. Stop passing
your views off as if they represent everyones. Many many people know
the difference between Pking and PvP. Pking involves Unwilling
victims, involves surprise attacks, involves using numerical
advantage, unequal loss on both sides and sometimes involves cheating.
PvP involves a knowledge of who the enemy is, the possibility of
surprise attacks (but In DAoC you have to go to a combat zone to
participate so really would you be surprised to be ambushed in a
combat zone?) and the possibility of equal loss on all sides.
