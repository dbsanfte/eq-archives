The Crown of Narandi from the 10th ring war is pal/sk/ranger only, with FT 2
Boots of Flowing slime from the new Cazic have FT 3
Both of these are droppable (boots are 75-100kpp on Tarew Marr, never seen
crown sold)

Also, you have a few no drop items
Brain of Cazic Thule (FT 1)
Eye of Cazic Thule (FT 1)
the aforementioned 7th coldain shawl (FT 1)
Crystal Enervated Armband (FT1) off Doomshade (crappy stats though)
Grodan's cape off Xi Thall in maidens eye (FT 2) (very nice, 35 AC cloak)
Wito Xi Tetoracu (FT 2) off Itraer Vius
Tome of Self Reflection (FT 2) off Zelnithak in Umbral plains (no other
stats at all though)

And a bunch of other stuff I can't list because my computer is being ghetto
today and dropping all its memory down a big freakin hole.
