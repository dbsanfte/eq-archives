This reminds me of the first time I went on a Naggy raid.  I was level 47
and it seemed at the time to be a huge deal to me to kill a dragon.  When my
group was called in, the first thing I did was hit my screen shot key.  This
locked my system up for about 15 seconds while it saved the SS.  When by th
etime I had regained control, I was on my way to my bind point.
