Who knows? Every class and race can't use an item just because another
class or race can, the game is like that. Shorties and biggies have
complained about the hero bracer but its not going to change
apparently, etc. There are a lot of similar examples in game.

My take on it is that they decided fungi tunic would be something
every vah shir  beastlord twinker would get so they could run around
healing HP faster than they lost them in the new vah shir zones and
this might be not the greatest thing with other people trying to play
there without that advantage. They figured, "hey, this is a new race
and class so is not really guarunteed to get a particular item so lets
make that not happen."  Really you can kind of see their point.

Or perhaps its just an oversight and they will change it, either way
they already know about the problem (from posters on their board
raving about it) so the ball is in their court.
