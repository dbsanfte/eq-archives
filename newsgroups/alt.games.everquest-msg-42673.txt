Actually, I've seen a number of credible claims that "Bin Laden,
the Soviet-fighting freedom fighter" is a myth, and that Bin Laden
was not part of the Afghani fighters at that time -- he has

I'm not in a position to settle it one way or the other, but
I just thought I'd mention that there is some dispute on
that point.
