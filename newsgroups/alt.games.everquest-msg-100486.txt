I agree.  I learned to quad with the cougars on the third island.
Ensnare four and herd them down to the rocks which are north and
around the corner from the dock.  You won't have adds there and they
are fairly flat which helps keep your pack together.

At 35 or so, graduate to the wolves on the first island.  Go directly
south of the druid ring to the shore and you'll find some completely
flat ice floes.  Go inland and gather four wolves and bring them down
to the ice.  It is safe to med up there too.  Wonderful spot.

The best XP I've seen here is to take a chanter with you.  Group and
have the chanter keep your clarity and wis buffs intact.  The chanter
must sit far enough away so the mobs don't aggro on them but close
enough so you share XP.  DON'T let the chanter attack while you have
your quad together; it will break the pack.  If you end up with one or
two alive at the end of the hunt, the chanter can use some DD on them
and help that way if they want.  This method more than doubles the
kill rate, so you end up with more XP than you would in a totally solo
operation.

Quadding is wonderful!
