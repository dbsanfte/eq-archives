Actually, I had a similar issue...  I have an HP Pavilian p500  (yeah, I
know, cheapie computer, but it was all I could afford).  I had the problem
with the cursor sticking in the center of the screen, the hyperactive
backgrounds, spontaneous reboots, etc...

I called EQ tech, and they <gasp> actually -solved- my problem!!!  =)
Basically, I have an Intel video chip (not a card, a bloody chip)...  One of
their patches updated the graphics engine (and that's when my problems
started)... I went to Intel.com, downloaded the latest drivers, installed
them, and haven't had a problem since... =)
