Well remember I am a bot shaman.   If im the only shaman, not only do I have
to focus and stamina EVERY group (I had to do that once without group focus,
yuk) I also have to pull the mob.   Unlike your guild perhaps, I can't go
pull the mob whilst the shaman is buffing/making mana.. i have to complete
1, before I finish the other.

Thats why if im modding/canni'ing and ask for a heal.. I get it.   Not only
do they all want the buff (well except clerics).. they also want the mob
pulled

Of course if our main shaman is there (MGB, canni 5) ae focus and getting fm
takes about 30 seconds
