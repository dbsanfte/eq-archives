I think much if it is Luclin.

First, Luclin has some good XP zones for lower levels, that are easier to
get to than the lower level Kunark XP zones (unless you are an Iksar,
perhaps).

Second, Luclin has the Bazaar and the Nexus.  These became the hub of EQ,
and the Luclin XP zones are closer to them.

PoP will probably increase OT population, because there is a PoK port to OT.
