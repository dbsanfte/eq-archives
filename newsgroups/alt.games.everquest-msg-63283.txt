After 2 years of trying to get in on a good GM Quest, I found myself
aiding Ognit return Al'Kabor from the Nexus yesterday, thanks to
brother wizard Othen, on my server Ayonae Ro.

I was selected to be one of four wizards, and later the center of
attention, and have now been granted the title 'Kadath of the Nexus'

Thanks to Othen for being such a GREAT sport!

Was tons of fun and I was honored to be selected.  Oh and the Artifact
I got was pretty cool too, Necklace with AC 15, 50 HP, 20 Magic
Resistance, with an effect to be revealed on tuesday, which is
speculated to be Group Portal: Nexus.
