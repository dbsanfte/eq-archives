That would seem to be the case. I've not heard of ONE name being that 
wasn't the result of a petition. I could be wrong of course, there are 
many players out there that don't whine when something as trivial as 
that happens. As a matter of fact I wanted my enchanter's (Fuurst) last 
name to be der'Finsternis (he's a dark elf and you Germans out there 
should figure it out ;p). I petitioned (why o why can't you use an 
apostrophe in /surname anyway) and was told by the GM that it was 
inappropriate. He/she was very courteous in the explanation so I didn't 
think anything about it. It was against the rules and pointed out as 
such. I accept that.
