Even if you found the right ogre, you probably still couldnt' complete
the quest. The ogre is getting stuck on the underwater ship and has to
be agroed and moved (then camp out to clear agro) to get him to walk
to the right place. If there isn't a faction hit involved, you might
be able to kill off the 4 ogres (or ask a friend or guide to do it),
trigger the correct one on respawn and pull him off the ship when he
gets stuck so he'll complete his path. According to the crucible,
people have completed the test of patience that way since it became
buggy. Probably easier just to file a bug report every day until it
gets fixed.
