Its important to know who your group mates are.  Don't assume they know what
they are doing.  Some don't know what they suppose to be doing even at high
lvl!  When I join a group I ask who is doing what and who buffs or heals and
root method.  If all member in a group is not up to speed with there task,
tell them.  And, watch if all of them are playing properly.  Caution them if
they are not good team player.  Good teamwork is your life insurance.  In
fact some of my best team play was done in total silence.  Everybody did
there work and there was no time for chatters.  My pally advanced full lvl
last night in High Keep Basement with full group.  When mobs are coming in
continuously, you can see that exp bar go up by the minutes!
