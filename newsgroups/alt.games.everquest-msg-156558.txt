I decided to start a Vah Shir Shaman (white Tiger), put 10 points into
Stamina and the rest into Wisdom, and got him ported to the Nexus. (He's
level 3 atm)

I've been trying to decide what kind of gear to buy for him, besides what I
already have equipped him with.

He currently has:

Ry`Gorr Chain Coif
Ry`Gorr Battle Mail
Totemic Vambraces
Serpentine Bracer (one only)
Leather Gloves
Soiled Breechclout
Greyhopper Hide Boots (they were one of my other alts' (Halfling Ranger) old
boots)
Velium Etched Stone Mace (bought it for the same other alt, but never used
it; he uses Piercing (Brightwood Spear) and 1HS (Coldain Velium Longsword))
Shiny Brass Shield (same other alt's old shield; has a Crested Mistmoore
Shield now, primarily for the resists)

Plus the Initiate Cloak he got after doing the registration quest.

I also know an Enchanter willing to make some +2 Wis rings for him for free
once I get the Shaman to Freeport (which I will do after getting the Shaman
to around lvl 9 or so; gonna use the boat from BB most likely)

My question is:

What would you recommend I replace the leather gloves with, and what would
be a good choice for a second wrist slot item and shoulder, neck and waist
items?

 I'm looking to spend no more than 300pp total, and would like at least one
of the items to have a Stamina bonus. (My main is hunting in DSP atm, so I'm
not getting any coin or items worth selling, just exp)

Thanks.
