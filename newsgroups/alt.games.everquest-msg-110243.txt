Luclin isn't a concern at the moment, but it definitely will be at
some point.

Wow!  That's heavy.  But why would anyone want more than 640KB?

It runs fine as it is, unless there are a lot of PCs around.  Some of
the mobs disappear and reappear when they're at long range, but that

and bandwidth issues.  Unfortunately I can't get broadband where I
live, so I have to make do with ISDN.
