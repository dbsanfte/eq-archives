You might consider *not* rezzing folks in ldons until afterwards for just
this reason. There's a good chance that if you just let them run back to
the dungeon from PoK or wayfarer camp soulbinder that they'd be much better
off, timewise. You might even skip most of the buffing, too. It's one thing
when you're in that 15-minute grace period before the adventure begins --
you can throw pretty much any buff you want to on folks and recover
afterwards. During the adventure (and especially after a wipe) you probably
only want the absolute essentials up, otherwise you're wasting too much
time medding back up. I'd probably consider Temp on the tank to be an
essential, but not for the wizard, necro, bard, etc.
