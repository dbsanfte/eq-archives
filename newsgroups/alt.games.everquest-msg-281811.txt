I have had no trouble getting the 2 newer expansions but I can't find
EQ:Platinum anywhere!  Not at EB, Gamestop, Walmart, Target, or any
other places that sell games locally.  I even tried online and everyone
has it on back-order...has it been discontinued or do they have a new
collector type set coming out?  I ordered it through EB online back on
the 15th of October and it is still on back order!  I have the two
newer expansions just sitting around and nothing else.  Am I missing
something like where I could d/l it online?  I have a 385k/3mb DSL so
wouldn't have a problem d/l it somewhere for a reasonable price.
Thanks in advance.
