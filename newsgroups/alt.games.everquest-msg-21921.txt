Aye, been playing in a group with people high level enough for CHeal
recently in Sirens' Grotto, and the D thing is fantastic.  See a tank get
even a little tickle and I start CHeal on him.  He loses aggro I D D
and patch him with celestial instead unless I have to switch to someone
else.  If damage is coming too slow I can DD and restart CHeal.  This
way the CHeal goes off when the target is at 30H or so, without me
having to be a genius at guessing when to actually start the cast.

Of course with a full group you need to kill 3 times as many mobs per hour
to break even as you would with a partner.  A -good- group can more
than accomplish this, but often I find I'd be better off with fewer members
in a group.  Course once hitting 49 I stopped my relentless push to
level, I'm just hanging out with buddies between res requests, so these
little details stopped mattering so much.

Yep, just what I was saying about D and CHeal.  The combination means
you never cast it on tanks who aren't all that injured, and yet -do- have it
already started when HP takes a nose dive.    C2 is nice but far from
crucial, most important factor of clarity is downtime, not during battle
mana.... same thing as with a bard, who should rarely sing manasong
during a fight.  Of course C2 is up during the fight, but my point is it
really doesn't make much difference whether it is or not.  ((hmm, I say
downtime, but I mean more like "easy time." Good group doesn't
have down time per se, after all.

Well, from a practical standpoint, the fact that sitting to camp out
politely means getting aggro, and any hit makes me stand up breaking
camp, means that /camp doesn't seem functional.  Quit, which
exposes me to the risk that I'll die without being able to respond
to whatever is killing me, seems like an alternative that has its
own balancing factors.  In a group, I've never done either, but
in a raid situation, where I'm being counted on to put the raid
back together in event of a wipe out, my understanding is that getting
logged out alive in place is actually my main job, with keeping tanks
alive when things are going well a distant secondary concern.  For
all that I think I've done it twice... but I only just hit 49, so until
now it hasn't been my job.

Thanks, wasn't paying attention, someone in my guild
gave me a grats mesage and I already had a blue in.  Its
so nice to have 49 at last, and not care!

By the way, where's that improved IVU drop?  A guildmate
recently needed several bodies CR'd in LGuk and I was
thinking how nice a actual reliable bulletproof invis would
be for that!
