No, you didn't. You said they should go to jail. Nice backpedalling,
but you're not fooling anyone. You obviously were suffering the
delusion that it's illegal for a business to kick someone off their
property for whatever reason they damn well feel like, and have since
realized you're wrong. But, rather than being mature enough to admit
it, you're backpedalling like the spineless little worm you are.
