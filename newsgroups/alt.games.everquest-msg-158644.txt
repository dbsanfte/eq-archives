 There is no botch. With the patch awhile ago, Verant made tougher
monsters award more XP. This is why people went to zones like Cazic
Thule to XP. High con mobs that gave good xp. The mobs in PoV that
people are XPing on are level 62. So it makes sense that if you can XP
all day on mobs that high, your XP is going to move faster than leveling
on low blues.
