Actually, I was going based on my own experiences with it (180+ in six
tradeskills) and those of my lover (200 in four tradeskills, 250 in
brewing), those of a good friend (Max Alchemy, 150+ in several tradeskills),
a husband/wife team of friends (chanter & shaman, multiple tradeskills
mastered, GM jewelcraft), all of whom report similar results.  I went to
EQTraders and just did a quick search to toss something out for you folks
who wanted to see something online.

Keep your bridge.
