"Nickle and diming" if you actually mean it that way is probably better
than a few major cash sinks, with all players subject to costs of living
rather than only those who pursue the goal of major sinks.  Tie
combating item deterioration into a skill system and it allows you to
foster trade skills as required in the world rather than just for fun
and enables those of that mindset a method of play other than kill/loot.

Perhaps a system where NPCs could perform maintenance with much higher
costs for the antisocial or trade skilled players perform the same
service at marketable rates, but they in turn require crafted or
purchased materials for the task.  In effect a warrior needing his
shield repaired then leads to an armsman needing to purchase metals
which leads to.... (smelters, miners, etc.)  Now you have not only a
cost in coin to the owner of the item, but a chain of folks required to
complete the task each needing to invest in materials and supplies to do
their part of it.

So in using this system you are of course also putting a hard cap on the
number of players in a given world?  Seems that with a finite resource
scheme you have control over the other parts of the equation, but with
the number of players infinite problems arise.  Are you running numeric
simulations to test your theories for the system you are building?  Even
with an upper limitation I would be curious to see what the effects of a
very small and very large population have on the systems balance.
