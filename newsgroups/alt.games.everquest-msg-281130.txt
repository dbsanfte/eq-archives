I didn't see it for any other classes.

5 minutes, not all that long.  A couple of fights later and it's up
again.

It didn't list duration:

Translocational Anchor

Type: Activated, Refresh Time: 0:5:00
You may train this ability at Level 70
Requirements: No previous ability requirements

While under the effect of this ability, an NPC will not be able to gate
away from you. Additional ranks increase the duration of the effect.

Oh I agree, not game breaking at all.  In fact it's refreshing to have
another class which can prevent the tragedy that is the gated mob
train.  Right now there are only a few classes which can reliably stop
a gate.  Bards aren't all that common and at least half of the time you
aren't going to have an enchanter in the group.  Stuns may or may not
work.  On top of that, I don't know how many times I have grouped with
a mezzer at high levels who *still* didn't know how to mez a gating or
C-healing mob.

"Oh I never thought of that!"
