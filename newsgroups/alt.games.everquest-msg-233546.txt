Inspired by Graeme's challenge to do LDoN without druid or cleric, I have
done the most thrilling adventure so far. I didn't know if anyone have
undertaken an AoE in LDoN nor have heard of any tactics for it. But after a
short persuasion of 3 wizard friends, one guildie enchanter in suicidal mood
and finding no less suicidal ranger, we set off. Place of choice was
Takish-Hiz, since we all happened to think it has the straightest maps with
usually one fork. Well, maybe two, we thought...
The group was following 56 enchanter, 56 enchanter, 55 wizard, 56 wizard, 56
wizard and  57 ranger.. So, yeah, we kind of had a whole 300 hp heal at
hand.
I must admit that we did it just for the thrill of it, to see if it can be
done and we weren't really worried about deaths or winning/losing it or even
getting our money worth spent on runes. And we cheated a bit, since we got
guildie cleric and older enchanter to buff us (HoV, VoQ since we weren't
planning it was going to take long, VQ and GoD, and all sorts of resist
buffs). Buffed up almost as we were going to try and slay Lady Vox in 6
people team, we are getting an adventure -- and.. We are getting a slaughter
59 (haha, couldn't be more convenient, eh?)
Well, we go in. First thing -- this bloody map has a very long corridor and
then 4(!) branch-offs! First sign it's going to take at least 5 runs.. We
make a formation in the very entrance hall, though doubtful we could ever
make it to the zone in if s..t hits the fan. Ranger sets off pack shrew and
Camo, runs away with the intent to get to the split point and bring as many
as he could. Haha! Camo apparently fell, and he goes down without even
making it to the point.. First "ranger down!" We are all laughing, he
respawns in Ro, gets buffed up again (it all went on so quickly that our
senior cleric/enchanter didn't even leave the WF camp)..
Second try went on more successful, he managed to get to the branch offs,
dropped invisibility and started running back.. Thanks god for resist buffs
and gear... Our brave ranger didn't get rooted or snared and made it to us..
With all the ugly and nasty sand elves flooding the room right after him.
The AoE slaughter begins..
Ok. Brief remark.. Very wrong choice of a dungeon.. Quite a few casters, and
they tend to resist on lowest stun.. So, taking 2 enchanters was a very good
guess, not an extra caution (I admit, I thought I could deal with it on my
own..) After AoE Tash things go smoother, ranger actually casts couple of
heals, quick reaction of AoE tash on the bunch of casters crowding the door
gets then very upset with my friend and they join the party inside the stun
zone.
We are all out of mana and we did it. 25 of 59. Not bad for totally suicidal
adventure. Med, rinse and repeat.. 3 runs down, 2 to go. Big deal is to get
casters within the AoE zone, and usage of AoE tash and Colour Slant is
imperative.. 2 Enchanters is an absolute necessity too. Good piece of advice
for the ranger is not to step out of  AoE zone. That kind of heroism is
totally uncalled for and is more suited for "Act of Valor" of paladins...
We wait for ranger, he comes back buffed again, runs away to get mobs.. We
only needed half a dozen slain, so we almost certain in the victory.. Well,
god gave rangers track for a reason, but none the less he brings the named.
Let me tell you... No taking named with AoE group. Not a good idea. Oh,
well, live and learn.. We get buffed all over again from dormant guildies in
PoK and make a run for it. We still have like 50 minutes left. Clearing the
last branch (not the one with the named) and here we are -- we won the
adventure.. We honestly decide to leave the named alone and happily gate out
for a split and rezzes...

Due to the fact that we got lucky with the task, but very unlucky with the
map it was a major over kill and wizards even had to stop nuking waiting for
casters to join in. Heals were not really needed, but HoV and runes came
handy... And loot actually more than paid off the expenses..

Well, sorry about the long post, just felt like sharing.. (and I am not even
thinking of trying to rival Monual, hehe, I enjoy his stories)
