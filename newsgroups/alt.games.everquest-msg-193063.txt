Actually, Rob quite clearly implied that it annoys him to accomplish
something in the game, and then have the secret given away and everyone else
gets to do it easy.  I suppose this comes from seeing the game as a
competitive environment. Once you achieve something the hard way, you might
feel justified in the having the attitude, "See what I did?  Now you try."
It's an understandable thing, but it does disregard the fact that different
people have different motivations for playing the game.  A person with this
attitude must understand that he/she should only guage the accomplishment
against those that have the same attitude toward the game.  Those that use
the work of their predecessors to easily accomplish the task are not to be
looked down upon.  Their motivation for playing is different.  OTOH, if I
used Rob's work to achieve what he did, I certainly would not gloat about
it, nor would I expect congratulations from Rob.  Now, if I too did it the
hard way, then I would feel I belonged to the "inner circle", so to speak.

Cheers,
Eric
