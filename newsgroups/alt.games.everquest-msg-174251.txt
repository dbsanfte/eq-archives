You have to pass one (any one) of the trials in Plane of Justice to get
flagged for Plane of Storms and Plane of Valor.

Most people go for the trial of execution, because that's the one that was
the first to have an optimal strategy figured out, but Verant says the other
trials are just as difficult.

In this trial, there is a platform at one end of the room.

A prisoner stands on the platform.

Four waves of four mobs each will spawn.  There are two types of mobs,
fungusbeasts and rockfiends.  The fungusbeasts are mezzable, the rockfiends
aren't.

A bit into each wave, an executioner will spawn.  Neither the prisoner nor
the executioner can be targeted.  The executioner will start walking up to
the platform.  When he gets there, there's a little dialog he does with the
prisoner, and then he kills him.  When the prisoner dies, the trial is over.

But when you kill one of the mobs, the executioner will reset back to his
starting point and start all over again.

So the trick is to focus on one mob and kill it as fast as you can.  When
the mob is ALMOST dead, the main tank picks a new target.  When the first
mob is dead, everyone /assists to acquire the new one.  When all four mobs
are dead, you have a minute or so to med up before the next wave.  Everyone
needs to stay all bunched up, so that if someone else gets aggro, the mob
won't run off.

If you make it through all 4 waves, the executioner attacks.  Kill him, and
you win.  You have to loot the mark from the dead executioner.

You have absolutely NO margin of error.  If anyone makes a single mistake,
you will not pass.  I've been in groups that have failed simply because the
mob ping-ponged.

Buff up beforehand.  Summon pets beforehand, and use summon companion to
pull them into the trial room.

The key is DPS - the more, the better.  Suggested group:
Tank with taunt.
Other melee.
Other melee.
Cleric.
Enchanter.
Anyone else.

I'd advise getting level 60 first.  It'll make it easier to get through the
trials.  Plus, you probably won't be able to find a group in PoS/PoV at 57,
so you might as well wait.
