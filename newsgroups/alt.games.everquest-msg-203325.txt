Not really.  Or at least not easy enough to make it worth trying to figure
out.  I'd suggest SLRN if you are using a shell.  It's very full featured
for being a text-mode application.

Oh, and change the options to set your editor to be pico (same interface as
Pine's editor) or you'll end up getting acquainted with vi.  I've been using
unix since before I had even heard of DOS or Windows and I never did like
vi.
