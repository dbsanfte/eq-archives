I'm looking for a good partner for a cleric and/or an enchanter, and I was
wondering which of these 2 would be better.  this will be a 2-box combo, and
I'm not really looking for a melee.  I like the feature sets of both
classes, and I'm leaning towards Magician as the better partner (pet,
ability to buff pet, etc)...but I like the wizard spell list and the raw
damage that can be done by a wiz, as well as the ability to snare and later
on quad.

Thanks for any input, thoughts, advice or information!
