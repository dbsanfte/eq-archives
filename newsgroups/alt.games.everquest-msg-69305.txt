	One day, back around June or July IIRC, I was passing through QH en route
to Qeynos.  I hit track as I exited WK, and Hadden was up.  I clicked on him
and said "that won't last"...but it did.

	Ran over, no one was there, whacked him...got the earring.

	Second luckiest find of my EQ career.  (The first being the Shattered
Emerald of Corruption, of course.)
