Yeah, I see that all the time:

Portee: "Can you port me to DL?"
Porter: "Sure, for donation."
Portee: [thinking] "Hmm...he didn't specify how much...better give him
50pp just to be sure."

That's never a problem, because it's pretty much common knowledge to
anyone who can afford it how much a port is worth within reason.

As I have said, offering 15pp when the porter was expecting 20 or 25pp
is a lot different than a high level character or low level uber twink
offering 35gp and a MQ wolf skin.
