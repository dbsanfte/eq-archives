The trial that i have is New Dawn (for the european servers) I take it that
the expansions will work with that?

I did buy a copy of EQ about 18 months ago (standard + The Ruins of Kunark &
The Scars of Velious), unfortunatly financial difficulties meant that I had
to stop playing for a while, would it be better to use that and get the
other expansions or buy the gold version?

You say that I should consider the gold version after the 30 day trial. I
hope that dosent mean that I cant continue with my character using my
current setup. I assumed that when I get to the end of the trial I would
have the opportunity to convert the trial into a paid for account.

Cheers

John
