If they ever combine swapping buttons to trick people into clicking, with
having the "buy" button charge without further confirmation, then the thing
to do is call your credit card company and say you didn't intend to order.

The credit card companies really don't like that, and they bitch mightily at
merchants that generate too many of these charge-backs.  It would only take
a fairly small percentage of EQ players doing that to get the credit card
companies to tell Sony to clean up its act or lose credit card processing.

That would get attention at a much higher level within Sony than whatever
level the idiot that approved the button-swap crap is at, and that higher
level will not be pleased.
