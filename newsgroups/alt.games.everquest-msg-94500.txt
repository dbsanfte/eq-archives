Well those are all nice to have, but you're missing the point I think. I 
imagine what Thomas is referring to is Harmony. You know all those lull 
spells that your exploration team enchanter has on page 50 of the spellbook 
ever since he found out whose wake was referred to by Wake of Tranquility? 
Maybe they might have a use if they were unresistable, eh?
