Lets see... Last night my wife and I duo'ed the entry to Crypt of Nadox,
killing the Elementals, and the occasional troll. In the course of the night
we got a Firestrike Earring ( 2 AC 7 Int 15 Mana, 30 hp, 4 svs MAgic and
Fire ), a Wis caster collar ( 6ac, 5 Wis, Some other stats, and 5 to a
couple of saves, dont remember exact stats ), a set of boots that are 16 ac,
3 wis, some other stats, mana and hp, and 9 sv Magic, again dont recall
exact stats.  Oh and we made approximately 340 plat in various vendor items,
and dropped coin. All this done my a 50 ( now 51 ) Warrior, and a 48 cleric.

Nah... Theres nothing worth hunting in LoY for a single group : P
