When SOE revamped the lull line of spells to make them actually work,
they specifically stated that charisma would affect the likelyhood of a
mob agroing or not on a resist. Believe it or don't, make's little
difference to me, but if the code works then there is a reason for a
lulling class to have high charisma. 

On the other hand, a very long time ago they said dex had no effect on
fizzles or missed notes.

However, I still wouldn't reroll. Losing a 4k earring isn't worth a
lousy 30 points in anything, assuming you're going to level the
character up past 50 or so, as it's not really hard to raise your stats
with items and high charisma items are probably the least wanted by most
classes other than enchanters or bards.
