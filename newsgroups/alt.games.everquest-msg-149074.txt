My baby got a tell from someone in WFree asking "are you a necro?" the 
other day.  I said yes and he said "I need help finding my corpse, can 
you help me?  I have a level (such and such) ranger."  I said sure 
(wondering why I was supposed to care about his main), loaded up my 
corpse locate spell, and asked where he'd died.  "Either North Ro or 
Oasis" he said.  Uh... okay.  I guess he coulda died while zoning and 
wasn't sure where he was.  We headed for North Ro, and I told him I'd 
meet him at the exit of the North Ro tunnel (I had sow, he didn't).  Got 
there, sat down and got some tailoring done while I was waiting.  Looked 
around, still no naked person.  Asked him where he was.  "Almost there" 
he said.  Did a /who.  He was in EC.  Waited some more.  Asked him where 
he was.  "Almost there" he said.  Did a /who.  He was in West Commons.  
And just then he says "Oops".  He must have been about halfway through 
WC because I did a couple more /whos on him before he was back in EC 
again.  Waited some more.  Buffed a couple kids hanging around the 
tunnel.  Waited some more.  He finally got there and I targeted him and 
... "you do not sense a corpse in this zone" or whatever.  I told him 
there were no corpses.  He told me he knew where one was in Oasis so 
he'd go loot that one first. Uh... 'one' corpse?  Oh yeah, he had two or 
three ... or maybe more ... lying around.  Uh.........

Ah screw it, was thinking of heading to Oasis anyway.  We get there, he 
loots his one corpse, I load it up.  No corpses in this zone.

I spend the next five minutes sitting on my butt while the guy says over 
and over "I dunno where they could be.  I wonder where they are?  Hm.  I 
wonder where they are?  Dunno where they could be."  Finally, when I 
realize that this VERY weird kid is never going to figure out where his 
corpses are, and wondering how the hell he got that many corpses that 
*need* to be looted, I give up, tell him good luck on finding his 
corpses, and I'm going to go hunt.

Another five minutes later I get a tell from a high level ranger saying 
"when did we speak last?"  The hell?  I decide to play dumb.  "Uh.. 
never, I don't think..." I answer, and he leaves off.  Get a mistell 
from him awhile later talking about finding his corpses.  And I have no 
idea how it ends, but that was one of the weirder people I've ever run 
across.
