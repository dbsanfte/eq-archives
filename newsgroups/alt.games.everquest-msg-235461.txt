That reminds me of a show called Family Guy, its a latenight cartoon.  These
four guys hung out at a bar alot and some british guy bought it and turned
it into a british pub.  They walked in and found out about it and tried to
talk to one of them, he used all these british idioms and slang, well, one
of the american guys said the only british idiom I know is that fag means
ciggarette.  Another american guy said, "Well, then somebody tell this
cigarette to shut up."  I thought it was hilarious.
