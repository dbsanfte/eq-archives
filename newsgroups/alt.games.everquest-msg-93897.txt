Well, that's true.  It's a great solo or duo zone though.  Easy, 
non-casting mobs.  Only a few of which run at SoW speed.

Kite along the south wall.  With my bard I would grab a mob at the TT 
zone, kite it along the south wall to the east wall, kill it a bit up the 
east wall, and grab another mob for the return run.  I almost never got 
adds, and if I did, it was easy to zone into CoM or TT to clear aggro.

Another reason to kite along the wall, less to display, less to lag you 
down.  It is a zone that really requires tracking for maximum efficiency, 
though at 42 almost everything will be blue to you.  Check out eqmaps, 
find the lowest level blue animals, and kill them.  Rinse and repeat until 
you hit 53 or get bored with the zone.
