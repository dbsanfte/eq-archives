While duoing with a necromancer in Stillmoon for quests, I noticed a
few weirdness with his Wake the Dead aa.  He was able to wake my own
corpse (while waiting on cleric for rez) and after the battle, my
corpse proceeded to haste and buff himself.  It was rather weird and
creepy and worse, he conned yellow to me. >_<  I never knew that aa
could wake toon's corpse.

Summoning a cleric type corpse also benefits as it healed our pets
while in the fight.  He never noticed that before and he's had that
necromancer for over a year.  So far none of his summoned corpse have
ever summoned its own pet so it's probably not possible or 3 pets
would make Necro the ultimate solo class. (summoned pet and summoned
corpse makes 2)

PS yes I got my level back after rez.
