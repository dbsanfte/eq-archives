That is a marvelous idea ! WE really are split 50/50 on big goverment cradle
to grave or the least amount of goverment possible. Of course history is
full of socialist goverments and they ALL produced crappy economies, death ,
torture and all of the related stuff.

The question is not which is better , that has been proven time and again ,
the question is why do so few people know it.
