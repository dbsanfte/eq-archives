Whatever. Rewrite history to your heart's desire. Leap on an insignificant
point with a flurry of pretentious outrage, then abandon that point in favor
of a totally unrelated one as soon as you loose ground on the first. Call
names until the cows come home, then claim you didn't. It really doesn't
matter because so few people bother to read your postings anymore.

That's really sad, too. I've read your writings for quite a while, and you
obviously know a lot about the game. It's just too bad that you insist on
going around trying to be Le Usenet Flamer Extraordinaire. So many people
killfile you after a post or two, they never get to realize the value you
*could* be adding to the group.
