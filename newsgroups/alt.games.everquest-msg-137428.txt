What is an acceptable amount to donate for a port and a bind?  I have a
couple of friends who are CONSTANTLY getting asked to port people and know
that on many occassions the person will just Run off without giving them
anything.  Last night I had to be ported twice once to a very hot zone for
which I supplied the invis and they supplied the port and then the bind I
gave 50pp which a guildie said was overly generous.  My port back from this
place I donated 20pp and the porter was ecstatic over the donation.....So
what is the proper amount to donate.
