Old Testament.  You are aware that Christianity is an offshoot of Judiasim,
right?  Still, that wasn't my point.  I was rejecting the idea that thinking
homosexuality to be wrong isn't in line with Christianity.

A far cry from it.  What you consider to be "semantics" is what allows me to
have gay friends, even though I think homosexuality is wrong.  It is what
allows me to have friends who "live in sin," even though I think it is
wrong.  It's what allows me to not walk around and be a judgmental SOB,
while I still carry a strong sense of what's right and wrong.  My attitude
is "I don't agree, but it's your life."  Why must I give up my own values so
as to not be "judgmental?"

Not so much letting go of agnosticism.  That was meant to be read as "(or do
I err, and you're agnostic)."  Not particularly well stated.  You can tell
that Percey Shelley's genes were lost on me.

How about the relevence of the Bible being that it is the word of God (if,
in fact it is).  The fact that it is a basis of religious belief for western
civilization should make it relevant, even if I'm wrong, and there is no
God.

Personally, I don't care.  I may think it's wrong... but at the same time, I
just don't care.

I doubt it was a mercy.
