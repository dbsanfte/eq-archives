No I do not condone behaving badly. If a soldier behaves badly it reflects
on it's CO. If a student behaves badly it reflects on it's teacher. If a
child behaves badly it reflects on it's parents. If a worker behaves badly
it reflects on it's boss.

Who is in charge of EQ?

"reflects on" and "soley responsible" are two different things.
