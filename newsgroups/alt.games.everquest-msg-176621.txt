Okay, I did already send this to the tech help people, but I thought I'd ask
ya'll here too, since you seem to be pretty quick to answer.  :)

I finally got my new computer all set up and online, and installed EQ gold.
I went through the patching process without a hitch.  However, when I went
to login, I could neither login with my old Station ID, or create a new one.
It says it can't connect to the login server, try again later.  Which I did,
but it still didn't work.  Maybe the server's just down and I'm being dumb,
but I just wasn't sure.

If it's not the server, any idea of problems I could check for while I wait
for the tech people to get back to me?  I'm connecting via broadband
satellite, and have no firewall.  It had no trouble connecting to the patch
server.

Thanks in advance!
