Hi All,

I justed wanted to let those who were interested know that I placed a new 
build of my character opt file editor on my website at 
"http://www.geocities.com/thorgrud/". This build has improved support for 
Importing/Exporting Macros and also has a couple of bug fixes. I've also 
begun implementing editing of the Abilities buttons. That doesn't work yet, 
but it does display the hex values. See the readme.txt file for more 
details.

come out?' I am not able to rightly apprehend the kind of confusion of 
ideas that could provoke such a question." - Charles Babbage
