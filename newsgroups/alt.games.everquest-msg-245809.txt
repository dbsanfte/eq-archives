No, you do not get transported. Your group must run to the dungeon
entrance. It's not a big deal though because they're close and once
you're in the zone the entrance is in, you get a nice blue line that
shows you which way to go to the dungeon entrance. You have 30
minutes from the time the adventure is accepted to enter the dungeon
so most people seem to run to the entrance, gather outside the
dungeon, buff up and med and then enter before the 30 mins is up.
(You don't want to buff up in the dungeon because the timer for
the adventure starts as soon as the first person enters.)

Since you don't get transported, you know the answer to this one. :)
