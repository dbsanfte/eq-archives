Over on Mage Tower some are perhaps comfirming that if you have IRE and cast
the pet wearing an Enshrouded Veil, then take the Enshrouded Veil off and
reclaim you will get back more mana than it cost to cast the pet, so perhaps
during the reclaim EQ is looking at what you are currently wearing to figure
the mana it cost you to cast the pet.  I tried this trick without IRE and it
doesn't work.  Oh well, I guess I don't have to worry about carrying
backpacks full of malachite anymore.
