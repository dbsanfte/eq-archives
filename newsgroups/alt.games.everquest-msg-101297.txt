Also, the old world dungeons are so train proned that is isn't even funny.
Though they have increased the exp AGAIN for under 30's going into a
dungeon. (So, in Najena you'd get the 10% bonus for being there, another %
for being under 30 and if you're lucky, some more for bringing a group of 6)
People, myself included, really should dungeon crawl more. it is the most
fun part of EQ, if you ask me anyway.

As for pick pocket, I have a level 34 rogue, with her burning rapier (you
need pickpocket for that item) and whenever she groups, I will ask first if
it is ok to pick pocket the mobs. If anyone has a problem, I refrain from
doing it. Most of the time, I only get something like one copper anyway...
