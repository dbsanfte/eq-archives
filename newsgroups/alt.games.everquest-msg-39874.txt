  Sir, I have not.  I, being the charming hostess as well as bride,
was handing out half stacks of Mead to all, asked for or not.  I
gave some to the groom.  He promptly drank THEM ALL.
 I am married to him in RL.  He currently lives in Washington 
state, I in San Diego. I called him the as soon as I saw the
chain "glug glug glug" messages.
Me: WTF?!?  We're getting married here!  You're going to be too
drunk to say your vows!
Him:  What?  I'm okay.
Me:  You're drunk, and staggering.
Him: (again, we are talking about a  RL conversation here)
     Lenny troll!
Even so, this wedding was vastly better than our RL one.

Annie  <--- Had a very crummy RL marriage, just so you all
            know why she wanted an EQ one.
