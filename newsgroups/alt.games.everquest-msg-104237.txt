Okay, best HQ bear drops are in everfrost newbie area.  Have most luck
between 6 and 9pm pacific(think it has to do with it being peek hours, more
people killing so more chance of the hq's droping). Also Backpacks trival at
88.  Best thing to do is save hq bears for when you are sure to succeed in
making the backpacks.  High failure rate even past trivial...Goto North,
South, or East Karana to kill cats, best ratio of hq cat drop.  Make
tailored quivors. Turn the mq into leather padding using skining knife to
downgrade to lq.  Can sell a stack of leather padding for 30-50p. You may
get alot of failures on quivors, but it is by far the least hassel item to
make until you get to 115.
