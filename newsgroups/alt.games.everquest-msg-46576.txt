Bin Laden has been involved in a series of attacks against America for
several years now.   He has made many public statements, including a "fatwa"
(an Islamic religious decree binding on all Muslims, kind of similar to the
Pope speaking ex cathedra) calling on all Muslims everywhere to kill all
Americans everywhere...military or civilian.  He has been linked to the
bombing of those U.S. Embassies in Africa, and the attack on the U.S.S.
Cole.  His actions against us are not something new and out of the blue.  If
it is not Bin Laden and his organization, then who?

Bin Laden's big beef is that U.S. military forces are in the Arabian
penninsula as a result of Desert Storm.  He sees our protecting Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia from Iraq as more of a bunch of filthy Crusaders occupying his
Holy Land and defiling it.  He believes that the presence of American forces
in Arabia is a hostile occupation, and just by being there, we have declared
war on Islam.

Should we get Bin Laden?  I think so.  He will plot to do more criminal acts
against America and Americans, even if he isn't guilty of this particular
attack against NYC and Wash. DC.  If we just leave him alone, it would be
like the police ignoring a serial killer.  Plus, he and his ilk are
terrorizing the common population of Islamic countries as much as he's
terrorizing the U.S.  The secret fear among many Muslim families is that
their sons will be conscripted or recruited by one of these fanatic
organizations.  We will be doing the Islamic world a favor if we liberate
them from these Islamic versions of the KKK/Neo Nazis.

But we may also be doing the world situation a whole lot of good by getting
our troops out of Saudi Arabia.  If that is a diplomatic sore spot, then why
irritate things further?
