You are full of it. If you tell your pet to sit down during combat he sits
long enough for you to get hit again then he re-enters combat. Unless this
just got changed as I was writting this cause I just tried it again. Last
time I tried to have pet sit down during combat was way back at lvl 29 and
it didn't work then either.

So my question to you is have you ever played a Necro or were you just
excited that you figured out how to post a message.
