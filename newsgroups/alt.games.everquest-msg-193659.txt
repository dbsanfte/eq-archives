Ok,
	Looking for something to goof with offline.  For those rare
moments I need a break from the PC / EQ.

	I have been looking at both consoles lately, and the PS2 is
grabbing my eye for two main reasons.  The fact that its a DVD player
without having to buy addons (I have a DVD player already, but respect
products that come functional without having to buy addons), and that
the PS line has a longer history.

	But, both appear to have awesome games and graphics, and many
games are on both consoles.   But both have the lame No game  and one
controller at initial purchase.

	So, what would your input be on which to buy, and the whys..

Oh and if you know of any great gaming bundles for either system.
please let me know (would rather get a bundle because they usually end
up cheaper as a starter kit)

Your time and input is much appreciated.
