(Chuckles) Well, I'm willing to give it a thumbs-up if I can get the damn
thing to auto stack, and Biz told me how to do that. So I guess you can keep
that wallet closed ;) Actually, that was the WORST part of the new screen
for me, that plus the writing (descriptions) of something overlaps
everything else and I have a hard time reading it (and my eyes aren't as
great as they once were, anyway), but I'll play with it and move it around
and see if that helps. I was too pissed and exasperated with it last night
to do more than snarl at it ;)


thanks,
Darklet
