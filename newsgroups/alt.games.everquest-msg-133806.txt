Dodge (and Riposte and Parry and the monk's Block) are completely
distinct from the benefits lumped together in your displayed AC.
Those skills give a (very small) chance that a given attack is
stopped completely regardless of your passive defensive abilities.

I haven't seen anybody demonstrate that level does or does not
directly affect the damage you take from melee (I never got around
to isolating level alone as a variable before I got bored running
my own tests, I was mostly interested in seeing if displayed AC
was actually useful, and the answer is:  not very).
