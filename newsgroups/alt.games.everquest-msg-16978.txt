He he ... I beg you to differ.

I roleplay a female Highe Elf Cleric, because I think healing and taking
care of others fits the female personality more than a male.
Besides it's a much bigger challenge to roleplay a female when you are a
man, than to roleplay a male.

As for the "get items for free" .. sure, I've tried it, but only very rarely
and most often it's from friends I know in the game doing it because I made
a "run trough 4 zones, get a teleport, then run trough 3 dangerous zones and
resurrect friend" for them.

Personally I don't think that level 30+ players looks much into the sex of
your character except for the roleplaying aspect, which suits me fine.

I prefer to be judged on my actions and reputation than on whatever my
character looks like.

Oh and a report was once made and it said that about 40% of the female
characters was real life femalse, while 5% of the male characters was played
by females. *g*
