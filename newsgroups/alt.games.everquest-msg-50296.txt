I have just reached level 30 and now must choose what my primary
specialty will be.  In looking at past newgroup posts, I see
conjuration is a good choice for the swarm DoT used while kiting.  I
have to say I don't understand what kiting is then.  I thought DoTs
don't cause damage while the mob is trying to catch up to you.  My
soloing method so far (mostly in LOIO and the hermit in South Karana)
has been to snare, root, Dot, nuke, root again as needed until the mob
is 20-25% health at which point I don't bother recasting root if it
wears off.  From what I've read about kiting, the druid snares, runs,
nukes, runs, nukes, etc until the mob is dead.  Then there's quad
kiting, but I think I'm too low to be doing that yet =)

Alteration is winning as my specialization so far, because I've been
grouping throughout this level and act as primary healer.
