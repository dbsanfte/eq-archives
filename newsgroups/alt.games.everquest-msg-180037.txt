Like Jennaii said, in high levels it does seem to ramp up.  About a week
after POP came out, I got into a pickup raid in POI.  There was a ranger
there, level 62 if I recall, who was getting crits fairly often and in the
600 point range each time.  Don't know what AAs and bow he had, but they
made for an impressive damage dealer.
