   I don't know how common this is on normal servers, but on FV the fact that
the hammer that ports one to the Overthere is droppable makes it very popular.

   Anyways, it now drops one off on top of the little boat instead of inside. 
If  you jump into the hole in the deck to get to the original spot, you now get
stuck in the hold.

   I just told Lenny this after he ported.  He promptly jumped in, and yes, got
stuck.  He had to agro a worker and just the hammer to port out, then feign
death.  Stupid ogre.
