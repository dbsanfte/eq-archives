Well for me the game has 2 options, exp and raids.

Raids are warr/cleric/DPS
Exp is DPS

SK's don't fit in either for me.. never group with 1... never wish I did

I have an SK (lvl 53 or so) I know how pittyful their DPS is

Do you're own research for SK DPS, I'll tell you though, as a monk (the
rogue isn't my main, if you didn't figure that out yet...) in tier 3 PoP, I
can get 220DPS.   A rogue would be even higher, find a comparable SK and ask
them to parse

Then every damage dealer you grouped with was pressing attack for maybe 5
seconds at a time.  Their DPS is significantly greater than yours, if you're
not using spells, you're not holding agro, simple as that.
