If your objective is to make money, you will be better off to abandon
smithing now, and go out and kill mobs.

If your objective is to raise your smithing, then trivial all banded pieces
before moving on to anything else.  After banded, you have the expensive,
store bought option of Ornate Chain, not sure how high it will take you, or
the mind numbing green farming FS up to 180ish.  There are likely other
options that involve farming something or other as well.

As someone else stated, go to www.eqtraders.com to answer most tradeskill
questions.
