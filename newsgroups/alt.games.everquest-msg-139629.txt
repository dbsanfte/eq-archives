 Well to be honest, Statue and Idol are two different things. Idol
doesn't drop loot. Idol spawns after you kill Statue, but not in the
same place.

 Knock yourself out, kill Statue. But if you want to try killing Idol to
get AoW, all I'm saying is don't slow him. Someone may be able to squeak
by a Idol kill if he's slowed but they wont have that luxury on AoW and
he'll just end up poofing an hour later and nobody gets him.
