   I haven't read from the Bible in years, if no longer.  But I did have fun with one
once when I was traveling, and stuck bored and drunk in a hotel room somewhere in
Arizona or New Mexico (I always get those two confused).  There was a little card
stuck in front that said words to the effect of "Placed by the local chapter of the
Giddeons, give us a call if you have questions".  It just so happened that the room
also came with phone and yellow/white pages, so I decided to do just that.  Even
though it was about 8pm, I did get ahold of someone who answered the phone by
identifying themselves as the local representative of Giddeon organization.

Me:    "Hello, my name's Annie, and I'm staying the night at the Days Inn in xxxx
town."
Them:  "Hello Annie, I'm glad you called me."
Me:    "That's nice of you to say.  Hey, I have a question about the Bible you guys
left in my room."
Them:  "Really?  I'd be happy to answer any question for you!" (she really did sound
happy at this point).
Me:    "Great!  May I take the Bible with me when I leave tomorrow?"
Them:  (take a deep breath, then a long pause) "I... what?"
Me:    "Well, I want it. I was reading it, and now I want to take it with me"
Them:  "Ummm..."
Me:    "See, I got to the "Thou shalt not Steal" part, so I won't. But it's not
stealing if you say I can have it."
Them:   "Ummm...true enough...."

The conversation carried on like this for a few minutes.  Seems the local Giddeons
were very used to people stealing their Bibles, but hadn't considered the event of
someone calling and _asking_ to take one.  Lenny was on the bed next to me, stifling
his laughter, but I managed to stay focused on the task at hand.  Eventually, I did
get permission to take the Bible.  

Annie <--- Lost that Bible years ago, and doesn't really miss it, either.
