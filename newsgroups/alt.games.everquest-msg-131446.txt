Actually used it last night to rescue a gnome who had fallen into the TP
pool in Shadowhaven. His bind point was somewhere dreadful, so he didn't
want to gate, and hadn't gotten a port yet. Might have been interesting
to see if Levitate would have helped him any.

Afterward I cast Shrink on myself several times to become a very tiny
barbarian. Made getting in and out of buildings much more pleasant. I
suspect it let me run higher up along the walls of Paludal, too.

It's also interesting that you don't get a buff icon for Grow or Shrink....
