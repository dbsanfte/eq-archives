Last Friday night, I started playing at about 7:30-8 PM.  My wife and kids went to bed and the house got dark.  At one point I
started feeling really tired.  I couldn't see the clock but there's a flashlight in my desk.  I shined the light at the clock and it
was 3 AM.  I was almost at the next level and I also had some armor to buy and other things to do before I felt I could log off.  I
went to bed at about 4:15.

The thing is, if not for feeling tired, it would have been daylight that gave me a clue that I had been sitting in front of EQ for
over 8 hours.

For the record, there's no way I can do that during the day.  I'd feel like a pretty crappy husband/dad if I blew my weekend on a
computer game.  However, when it gets late and the family is going to bed, I can choose sleep or Everquest.  Lately it's been about
an 70-30 split between the two.  Everquest getting the 70% of my night.

Do I feel addicted?  You bet, but it's great.  I haven't felt this way about "computer leisure" since I was in high school.
