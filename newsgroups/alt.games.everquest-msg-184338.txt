Yeah, fair point.  What I've been comparing myself to is other clerics who
play as often as I do.  In the time since I was last awarded something,
they've gotten at least one and more often two pieces of equipment.  And
nice stuff, too, like two Shawls of Awakening and the Judgement stuff from
AHR.

lol, point to you. =)

Well, in my defense... our officers recently conducted a poll of FT levels,
and I was grouped with a bunch of people near the top of the list.  I told
the officer that asked me that I was at FT 12, but that I was hoping to
replace my Boots of Flowing Slime, and that if I got a nice piece like the
FT 7 BP, I'd replace the Boots o' Slime with Heraldic and pass the boots on
to someone else in the guild.  I don't know if that went over well or not.

Doesn't detract from your point, that the officers will want to put the BP
where it will do the most good, no matter how long I've gone without loot.

I have to admit, I'd kill-steal for a nice UV item atm... ever since I
replaced my Aegis of Life, I have no items that give off any significant
light.  Running through Neth Lair has become very annoying, especially when
zoning in from the Nexus.

Well, Darkened Claw - WIS 20 HP zilch MANA 125 -  upgraded a Black Runed
Talisman - WIS 12 HP 65 MANA 65.  Eight more WIS, 60 more MANA, 65 fewer HP
is, in my mind, minor.  However, the mana preservation thing on buffs
perhaps pushes it into a major upgrade - it really does make a difference in
all the Virtues I cast.

We've had people quit over loot - in this guild and others.  It always
boggles my mind when people do that - do you expect to get *more* loot by
leaving the guild?  =)

I'm not about to go ranting and screaming - I've kept my mouth firmly shut
because I do realize there are other issues involved.  But internally I've
been ranting and screaming.  =)

No, but they were "don't count" items.  The Temariel Vex was rolled upon
during a Frames raid, and I had the highest roll.  The Shroud was an item
that I was practically forced to loot, since no one in the guild wanted it
and it was an upgrade for me - I didn't ask for it.  The Hammer was also
considered non-loot because it was awarded based on my tradeskilling,
nothing more.  And the Ring was a quested item, something the guild was
expecting all of its members to obtain, and not considered a reward in and
of itself.

However, your point is good - I'm under-representing the total loot I've
been awarded since joining the guild.  I also was awarded a Black Runed
Talisman while I was still a recruit - which is quite unusual.  So it's not
as if I haven't gotten lots of nice stuff since I joined, and I should
remember that.

> In any officer award system, awarding upgrades to items that

Our officers made a recent change about asking for loot - you now have to
link the item that's being upgraded.  I'm fairly certain that's in response
to the Eighth Shawl upgraded by Shawl of Awakenings incident.

Yeah.  Yeah, I think that, more than anything, was the source of my
frustration, although I couldn't define it much less articulate it.  But I
think I had this irrational fear that since I wasn't being awarded loot, no
one liked me.  And that was upsetting me.

Now that it's been articulated and I can see how silly it is, I can deal
with it much more effectively.  =)

Heh.  I've always felt the officer decisions in my guild have been fair and
reasonable.  It's the decisions in our allied guild that have sometimes left
me plain mystified.  Like the Shield of Ssra; that seems *so* much like a
cleric item that druids and shamen shouldn't even bother going in on it.
But every time the allied guild got it, they awarded it to a druid or a
shaman and never gave it to a cleric.  The clerics were a bit peeved about
that.  In contrast, my guild gave it to a cleric every time but one.

I guess that's a matter of opinion about who would get the most value from
it.  Still, for the most part my opinions have matched up pretty well with
the opinions of my guild's loot council.

Thanks for the input James; helps me to put matters into perspective.  =)
