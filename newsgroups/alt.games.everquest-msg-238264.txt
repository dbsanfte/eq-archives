I had the same problems then I updated the Bios on my motherboard and it
solved my problems.  Go to your motherboard manufacturers website and
download the correct bios for your board and the flashing software needed to
do a reflash.  One word of caution though, should you lose power to your
MoBo during the reflash the MoBo could be permanently destroyed (Don't
reflash during a lightning storm basically)  Other than that, check and see
if the Bios on your Vid Card can be reflashed as well.  Hope this was
helpful.
