Missing generally depends on your skill with the weapon (1HB, 1HS,
etc.) you are using, and the AC of the monster you are fighting. Your
strength will also affect your overall Attack Rating (as well as
certain buffs, for example Wold-Form). Then you have the randomness of
the "roll" when in combat.
