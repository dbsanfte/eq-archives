Another note on this, why am *I* being called down to "cite" when I
claim they didn't increase their profit margin by that much when the
rate increased when nobody says anything to the jackass who claims
they did. Isn't he just as guilty as I am of supposedly "claiming to
have knowledge of VI's operating costs"? Since he made the claim
first, it falls on HIM to cite...
