To clear things up, I think of Everquest as MSVC++ and a sword as a
program made using this tool. Well Microsoft can say if you dont have
that particular registered version, you can't sell the program. I
guess if Microsoft said you can't sell any program made using this
tool (period) we just couldn't. And Verant has said you can't sell
products made with his game (swords).

Besides that, paying money for an item in a game, for me it just ruins
the game and is not fair with other gamers. If someone has better
armour etc than me, at least I can think this guy has no life :)  and
not that he is rich.
