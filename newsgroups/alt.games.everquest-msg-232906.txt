While I love ragdoll physics (Max Payne 2 has forever spoiled me... I 
cannot play a game with conventional death animations anymore), they 
could be a right pain to get to work online. Imagine a mob corpse 
tumbling all the way downhill for one client, but because of positioning 
issues, getting stuck on a rock for a different client. Physics are a 
right can of worms to implement in a multiplayer game.

Okey, I'm excited already... Where did you get this info?
