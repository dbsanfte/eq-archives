They deliberately put the items in and are letting people run around 
with them for a while so they all get good and hooked on how great they 
are.  Then they will remove them from people, but hopefully by that 
point they will be hooked enough on them to want to invest time/money to 
get them "legitimately".

Its a bug, if you've played EQ for any length of time you've seen dozens 
of others.  Big deal, not like its a Conspiracy
