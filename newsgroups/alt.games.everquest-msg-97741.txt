I think the Jargon File definition, while in line with the first response, is
worded in such a way that it better fits the EQ definitions.

http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/twink.html

twink /twink/ n.

1. [Berkeley] A clue-repellant user; the next step beyond a clueless one.

2. [UCSC] A read-only user. Also reported on the Usenet group soc.motss; may
derive from gay slang for a cute young thing with nothing upstairs (compare
mainstream `chick'). 

3. On MU* systems that specialize in role-playing, refers to behavior of a
(usually inexperienced) player that either ignores rules or social convention,
or disrupts the natural flow of a scene to show of super powers.
