Also, even if one enchanter has enough mana and time to cast enough runes to
keep blows from lasting on the main tank, try to have at least 3 enchanters
taking turns runing him.  This would mean that individually each one is
drawing a third of the aggro they would get if they were casting the whole
thing.  The more enchanters you have there, the more chance of spreading it
out and not having one aggro it off the main tank.

And (depending on how good your guild is on aggro control) you really have to
drill it into every monk / ranger / paladin / shadowknight's heads that if
they pull aggro off the main tank, it *will* cause a wipeout.   The wrong
person will be getting runed and Nortlav will be proccing, which means he will
be gaining his life back faster than you can damage it.    No pets at all.
All they are is free heals for Nortlav.
