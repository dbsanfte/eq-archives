That's what I got out of that exchange too.

I didn't even bother with this part of this thread because I've locked
horns with DT on the copyright issue before and its a dead end. I
remain unconvinced by his position, and he evidently remains unmoved
by mine...

Until DT can demonstrate that exchanging plat for $$ is different from
exchanging plat for an FBSS (in game item), or a Corpse Recovery
(player time) ... from a *legal* point of view then its not worth
discussing. 

Both involve transferring plat ... or duplicating it as he's decided
to call it, though I'm unconvinced that duplication is an appropriate
term even if its is 'indistinguishable from other plat'. And both
involve a tangible benefit to me, at least as tangible as the plat
itself. 

So my argument is simply: if I'm violating copyright exchanging plat
to a stranger for money then I'm violating copyright exchanging plat
to a stranger for an FBSS or a Corpse Recovery... unless DT can
demonstrate a legal difference.

We agree they are different from the perspective of the Terms of Use
to play the game...in that trading for $$ is expressly forbidden,  but
we've all agreed all along on that score... the dispute lies on the
criminal copyright infringement he alleges takes place.
