To be honest, I'm not sure what exactly is on this box, newsreaderwise.  
First thing I do when I sit down at any computer is ssh to the SunOS 
machine my .newsrc is stored on. :)

Let's see... 
nn: Command not found. 
rn: Command not found. 
trn: Command not found. 
tin: Command not found. 
slrn: Command not found.

No manual entries seem appropriate for USENET.

No manual entries seem appropriate for NNTP. 

Guess the boss didn't pick that package. :)

Ah! we do have Netscape 4.79 and Mozilla 1.4.  I could probably 
theoretically suffer through with those.  Although they didn't come 
installed...

I'm fairly positive, however, that the OpenVMS VAX machine I use to read 
news in the other lab has no native newsreader whatsoever. :)
