One big thing is to have someone designated as MA ("main assist").
This is often the same person as the MT ("main tank"), but not always.
The MA is responsible for selecting targets.  Everyone else should be
getting their target by targeting that MA and using /assist.  It's a
good idea to have a SA ("secondary assist") for when the MA dies or
goes LD.

The reason this is important is that you need to keep everyone on the
right target.  People on the wrong targets end up doing things like
breaking mez and getting the enchanters killed.

The most important thing for a raid guild, though, is having people
who will pay attention and follow the instructions of the raid
leaders.
