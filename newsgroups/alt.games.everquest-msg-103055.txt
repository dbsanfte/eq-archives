And this has *what* exactly to do with the guild chat discussion again?
Oh, nothing. Never mind.

But to correct any gaps in your memory, I insist everyone have guild
chat on all the time to *know* about the raids and such. Not to "take
part" in them. To quote you, "Readers are leaders. Try it."  Because we
frequently have guests, our raids used to be done in /ooc for the most
part. Not spamming up the /gu channel with raid chatter. It was an ugly
solution that could bother other people in the zone unless they were
willing to /ignore the raid and group leaders. But now we use the new
raid channels. I announced the name of the channel in guild chat, and
guess what? Surprise, surprise. Every member of the guild online logged
in to "listen in" on the raid. Even the low level ones who couldn't go
on it. It's called "taking an interest in guild affairs."  Quite the
phenomenon.

Of course in this case, it was more like tuning in to a radio broadcast
of a horror show, but they were cheering us along anyway.
