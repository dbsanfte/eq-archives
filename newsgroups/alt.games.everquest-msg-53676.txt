The majority of the velious dragons are the inhabitants of the west wastes.
Lots and lots of them. ToV also has a fair number. The velious list was
more or less in order of the zones as you get to them wandering through
velious. Outside of those 2 zones, there are only like 10 or so on the
continent.

Hunt in mistmoore, get your ring of scale faction up, and go look for
gorenaire in the dreadlands, she's a bit bigger than vox, but otherwise
identical. Vox is, however, a bit more majestic in her ice cavern than gore
wandering around outdoors.

>Are Vox and Nagafen the easiest of all the dragons?

Well, naggy is WAAAAAAY easier than vox, for several reasons. Many of the
west wastes dragons are easier than both. You can take most of the coastal
dragons with a single group of decent low-mid 50s people. Vox/Naggy are
actually relatively difficult, because of the level limit.

>Great list, Matt.  If you didn't look any of those up, I'm impressed.

I did a portion from memory, but particularly for the ToV and West Wastes
spawns (as well as the exact names of the 4 ST warders), I looked it up.
