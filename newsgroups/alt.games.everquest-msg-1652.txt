Well, I told you about my experience there :)  Heh I've been hunting the
overthere lately and I've enjoyed it.  Not too hard, but great experience.
Loot isn't bad, up to 2.5 pp on some creatures plus teeth and beaks that see
for another PP.  I'm not getting rich but I hit 20 last night, had to go
back to the mainland becasue I had to get my level 20 pet in Grobb, cept I'm
kos there... so a guildmember went for me.  Anyway, I got back to the
overthere about ready to go to sleep but I wanted to try my pet out.  Soloed
for maybe 45 mins and got a bubble into 20.  I really like this area, think
I'll stick around till 24, then try the sarnak fort on LOIO.
