Like I said, I think your definition is too broad.

In many situations you *expect* to get a double every now and then. If 
you are playing in a zone that's near the edge of your groups ability 
then usually you can deal with it...and sometimes you can't. You could 
play it safe and hunt only in areas where you can always win, but I 
frequently choose not to.

Thats not a "mistake" by any reasonable definition; its a deliberate 
choice.

Similiarly if the mob runs and gets adds because the SK's chaincasting 
of clinging darkness got resisted 6 times in a row... that's not a 
mistake that's just life with EQ's RNG.

Of course the game is tuned to CH... its not broken FOR clerics. Its 
broken for every group or raid WITHOUT one. 

Its broken *because* encounters are tuned expecting it to be available. 
If it were always available then it would be ok, but what about what 
happens when its not? Hundreds, if not thousands of encounters are tuned 
around having CH. Groups without CH are at a significant disadvantage, 
and are effectively fighting encounters that are more difficult for them 
than they were "supposed to be".
