What I would like to see, in CoH and in other games where you have to make
choices about what powers and skills your character will acquire at a given
point (e.g., how to spend spec points in DAoC, what path to choose in
skill-tree based games (isn't EQ2 one of those?), etc.), is a way to
temporarily try a choice.

For example, in CoH, it would be neat if, when you level up, you could
select a "tryout mode".  In tryout mode, you could pick your new power, and
then go out and try it.  While in those mode, you couldn't earn XP or
complete any missions.  When you went back to the trainer, you could elect
to make the power permanent, or give it up and try a different one.
