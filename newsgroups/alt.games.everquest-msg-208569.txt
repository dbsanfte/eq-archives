King...) and
> rereading some real classics (Heinlein mostly)

That guys got some brilliant ideas... its too bad nearly every single thing
he wrote was loaded with the kookiest 60's sexual-liberation themes taken to
their unnatual conclusion, and pretty much every 'protagonist' character is
a cardboard cut-out from this "sophisticated sexually liberated [or perhaps
juvenile pubescent male fantasy of what sexual sophistication should be]"
template -- male or female... not that I'm offended per se... but it just
gets old that pretty much everybody does it with everybody else more or less
constantly...it actually detracts from the good stuff. Far too many words
wasted on bad erotica, and worse rationalizations of how being promiscuous
is somehow empowering and sophisticated. As a single isolated subtheme its
an interesting exploration of the social results of a 'what if?' and good
sf... but as a recurring theme in all his work, to the point that it
frequently leads to the neglect of much more important themes..

Consider "I Will Fear No Evil"... it starts off brilliantly... the impact of
mind transplant technolgy on society, the deceased's survivors, and the
transplanted surviving identity in a new body anufactures ample conflict for
a story, and leaves unbounded space to explore, prophesize, predict,
moralize and so on... but all this is subjagated to tier two, while the
protagonist seeks closure and acceptance by sleeping his way through
everyone either he or the deceased knew...

...and then we move on to other disparate titles like Friday or The Number
of the Beast, or even his bestsellers like Stranger in a Strange Land or
Puppet Masters and they all exhibit not only an obsession with sex, but the
*same* sort of obsession.

It feels like a walk through the mind of  a Freudian archetype.

Philip K. Dick or Asimov would be my first choices for SF. And Robert J.
Sawyer for new SF.

Don't get me wrong though, Heinlein is still one of the greats...
