>4. Charm it - probably not a good idea if you're a low CHA halfling, but if 
>your mob is an animal, charming it as a pet is an option.

At L33 cha is virtually irrelevant to charm effectiveness, especially
at the level of cha a druid is likely to have, halfling or not. The
mob's MR and the difference in level between you and it matter far far
more.

There are many enchanters who believe this holds true at all levels
now. Cha, like dex, has had a major decline in popularity over EQ's
existance.

Think I'm wrong? Strap on 200 cha worth of gear and try to charm a
haze panther in WL.
