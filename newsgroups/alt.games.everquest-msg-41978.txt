The media is getting very good at showing images designed to provoke a
reaction.

I love those scenes in 'Wag the Dog' where they set up great-looking
photo-ops. And I think it was 'Under Fire' or 'Salvador' where the reporter
would carry a scorched doll to strategically place in rubble to get that
'poignant' image.

I like to think I can seperate fact from fiction and not be influenced by
nationalistic propaganda/rhetoric, but when the facts are filtered by
ratings-hungry networks it gets pretty confusing.
