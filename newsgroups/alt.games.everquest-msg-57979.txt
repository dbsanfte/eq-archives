  Well put.  A GM can't spend all day answering an endless stream of
petitions from irate customers.  Sometimes everybody has to let loose a bit
and have some fun, and if they have fun in a way that may bring something
unique and novel to the game like unicorns prancing about a forest, all the
better.  Though it may not be an event that many people find very
interesting, compelling or purposeful... what does it hurt?
