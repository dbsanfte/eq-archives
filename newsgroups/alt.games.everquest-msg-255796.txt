I will do my best nib, I was not much of a crafter myself, but did depend on
friends who were.

By depend I mean that literally.  There where no, zero, zip, zilch, nada,
dropped weapons or armor.  EVERYTHING had to be made by a crafter, from your
basic bronze short sword (they gave you a starting weapon of course) on up
to your most advanced Great Sword.  Similar to the crafting in DAoC each
"level" of crafting entailed a new material, bronze, iron, steel, and so on.
I say "level" because you did level in crafting, but that does not
necessarily correspond directly to the "level" of material.

There is crafting for EVERYTHING, from spell, to houses to the armor on your
back.  Food was used to reduce the time death sickness lasted.  The things
that DO drop can all be used in crafting at some level.

The closest one might get to a "Drop" would be what are called "Techniques".
These, along with the proper components allowed, crafters to add stats or
effects to items.  Such as "Speed 1 Tech" would add +5 to run speed and
result in Bronze Boots of Speed.  And so on.  Each growth of material had
additional benefits, such as room to add a second tech to the recipe.
Recipes themselves where drops as well, though many could be found on
various vendors.

At upper levels the material that can be harvested, ores, woods, creature
essences, etc. are in difficult to reach places.  Thus expeditions need to
be mounted (not necessarily large numbers) to get the harvesters into the
locations where the materials can be found.

Thus the entire economy was player driven.  If I, as an adventurer, acquired
several special things, maybe the material component for "Speed IV Tech", I
could either support my buddy who needed them and expect a new set of boots
in return, or set up the items on a Consignment merchant who would take 10%
of my price for himself.  Players would then check the consignment merchants
for their supplies.  If my item was purchased, the coin was immediately put
into my inventory (Zero weight).  IF I was online at the time, I would
receive a message such as "Jim just bought your arachnid mandibles for 200
silver from Merchant Joe."  This would allow me to develop a list of
possible markets for my goods (the next time I have something I can check
directly with Jim and ask if he needs/wants it.

I have not been to Istaria in several months, so I cannot explain much
better or be certain that some has not changed.

I do hope that helps a bit.
