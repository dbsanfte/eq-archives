I'm not sure if this will reach you in time, but this zone
is quite dangerous for being an "old world" zone (for it's
level). It may not look far to the music room or ballroom or
whatever on your map, but you may find it tricky to reach
safely at your party level.

As to advice:
1. Mistmoore is considered an "outdoor" zone, so make sure
everyone has SoW on at all times. The Druid can use harmony
to single pull mobs outside the castle. (Distances are too
small most places inside to use harmony effectively.) With
SoW on, most PCs should be able to run from the castle all
the way back to zone even with 15-30 mobs chasing them.
(Make sure someone has a "/shout Train" key too. =p)

2. You can invis your way as far as you are willing to risk
having invis break on one of the party members. (I recommend
to just inside the castle, at the stairs where the gargoyles
sit.) Invis doesn't work on the undead (Will Pillagers, Will
Sappers, Thought Defilers) that spawn near the ballroom.
Most undead in the castle only spawn during the EQ night.

3. Have your Cleric and someone with invis bind outside the
zone before you go in, in case you need to do CR.

4. There is a low level guard (pledge or initiate familiar,
I think) that patrols between the castle and the graveyard.
If this DE is aggroed it won't fight you. Instead, it will
run up to the castle and pull a train down on you. If, as
you are fighting, you see any guards try to run off, do
*not* allow this to happen.

5. An Enchanter, if you can find one, would be help a lot as
MM mobs have large aggro and social radii, and once you
reach the castle you will find them very tightly packed.
Adds are frequent. Snare is imperative. Never use AE inside
the castle.

6. If you are leading the expedition, and you have the most
knowledge of the zone (from a map or whatever), I recommend
you pop up Bard invis and thoroughly scout the route from
the entrance to the castle foyer before your friends arrive.
Again don't go too deep in the castle (especially during EQ
night) or the undead will spot you.

7. Lots of the DEs are wizards (they usually wear robes),
but few are healers. The DE wizards deal quite a bit of
spell damage for their level, but have few HPs. Thus, they
make good first targets when dealing with multiple mobs.

8. Don't let your Mage friend (or Shaman friend) make a pet
before you break the Ballroom. Pathing is pretty goofy in
this zone, and pets will wander off following runners and
promptly get you all killed. You might let them make pets if
you plan on fighting your way back instead of invising, but
make sure they watch pathing and keep a *very* tight reign.
