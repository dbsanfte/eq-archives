OoW attuneable are not tributeable because there was no way to
separate attuned item from unattuned item and they chose ti make it
all non tributeable.  No drop items were NOT supposed to be
tributeable but something got overlooked and many no drop items were
tributed anyway, flame-licked claw being an example for 2000 points.
SOE wanted to fix this to make it non tributeable.

Many no drop items that dropped in MPG and RSS were tributeable.
