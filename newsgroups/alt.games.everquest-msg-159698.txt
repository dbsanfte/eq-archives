I have an enchanter, mage, a druid available to me... ench 51, mage 30... or
32 I forget, druid 36
The enchanter does all the tradeskilling. I make all my own vials, enchanted
metal, clay, etc... I can get amiable faction anywhere but Cabalis and Grobb
(too many dead trolls on my back), and my base int is 230 (which means if
someone Kei's me I'm at 255. About a third of the enchanters with kei will
kei other enchanters for free if you are polite and they are unbusy).
The mage farms static/common spawns. Elementals, spiders in guk, etc are all
green to him and he gets me the materials I need rather quickly. His fire or
earth pet is far superior to dealing with:root, wak in, walk out, wait for
dippy the enchanter swordboy to finish his work
The Druid is what I use for pelt hunting, and for more rare spawns. Also, he
of course can forage, which is sometimes important. Finally, he, being on a
second account I have access to, acts as NRT (Norrath Rapid Transit) for my
two int casters, and muleboy.
(Note that that is a minor concern for them, as all three are bound in
(well, above) the firepot room, and my main account, with the int casters,
has PoP)
From former experiences on test with my mid twenties monk (though this may
get better as they level) melee's don't farm well at all.
