700 mana is relevant to a kei'd chanter (or c5'd wotver), I dont think =
so.

You don't have to group

Damn that invite button click is worth...50pp for sure :P

My swords cost me money...my spells cost me money, my mana dont cost me =
nothing....so are you saying that the other players should have to pay =
for the enchanters spells? Damn, I spent all that play on my wizzies =
spells...why dont people give him money (I will port for free when I can =
port, I aint gonna sit around charging people for it).


SoW doesn't last a minimum of 2.5 hours...  SoW doesn't

Wow you sure know how to stretch a single sentance....you still didnt =
make a point though....

The other argument, it may cost you 100pp for kei but in 3 hours you can =
make 300pp, thats still not relevant that 700mana to a level 60 and =
worth 100pp, sure the spell costs alot, lots of classes spells do...

Bleh....cant be arsed with kei argument, just hope nerf stick hits it =
(im a newbie on a newish server and even I can see that kei is in no way =
good for the game, especially for lower levels)
