You're supposed to be safe on a boat, but occasional pathing bugs can cause  
a nasty monster to aggro people on the boat occasionally - this is a rare 
bug though, and you should petition if you die to this.

Lots - Kedge Keep is a zone which is completely underwater, there are 
several lakes with aqua-goblin temples, seas with underwater shipwrecks 
with zombie sailors etc. A favourite pastime for my druid is to cast 
enduring breath and get away from some huge, crowded zone to fight 
underwater in the lake there, where noone else bothers to go.

Not really. You have to zone in and out of oceans on the boats. Some have 
suggested that if you swim into the exact spot on the zone wall that the 
boat zones, you can zone, but I've never managed to do this and it's 
probably an old wive's tale.

Did you know your ranger can teleport? And I don't mean via the Nexus...
