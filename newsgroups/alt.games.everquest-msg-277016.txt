I just encountered something vaguely similar yesterday that made me
chuckle - I was levelling a bard up to 8 in Misty (Diseased/Thicket
Rats near the druid ring) and a druid in wolf form comes up to me.
"Which way is Rivervale?" I was asked...  "Follow this zone wall about
100 yards north, I tell them.

Hard to credit that a player with a Druid of sufficient level so as to
be able to use Wolf Form didn't know where Rivervale was...  or use
in-game maps, or just Track the guards. Hmmm

Oh, two days ago, I also had a lvl 1 mage, outside Freeport, ask if my
lvl 4 Bard could donate some plat for spells. Now, I *never* object to
this, as I remember what it was like as a lvl 1 caster, myself, so I
gave them the 40 to 50 plat I had on me.  The player thanked me,
saying that although he had a lvl 65 Cleric, he was absolutely flat
broke!  Now, I still don't mind donating some "lunch money" funds, but
find it very hard to believe that a 65 cleric is unable to raise a
measly 50 plat.
