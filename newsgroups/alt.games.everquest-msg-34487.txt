I'll judge this by the Regeant Symbol of Innoruuk, which I use, which has
infinite charges of Clinging Darkness (DoT Snare).  If the Tunare symbol is
at all similar, then it has a huge casting time, has a good share of
resists, and seems to last not as long as the actual spell.  Next to that,
add that while you're medding, the critter is regenning his hp as well,
helping negate the damage which you are doing.  This turns into horrible
inefficient killing.  It's mostly a novelty and stat item, with a little
utility.  For example, I was kiting in Ill Omen with my DE cleric, using the
Clingling Darkness as an opener, then running at JBoot's speed while nuking
all the while.  When I got low on mana, I'd root, and med, then blast again.
The item just adds a tiny bit of versatility.
