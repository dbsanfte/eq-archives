I too have noticed I get beat silly -far- more often on a resisted slow than on
a successful one.  I wish the reverse was true, frequently I want to slow till
it sticks, then tank after it does, but when I -do- land the slow, now I have
to work for aggro!   Fortunately the solution to both problems is the same;
root.  If I -don't- want to get beat on due to resisted slows, rooted mobs are
ideal since they will stay over there away from me.  If I -do- want the slowed
mob to beat on me, thats easy if its rooted, I just get right in its face and
have the others back up to max melee range, and boom, its me that gets the
lovin.
