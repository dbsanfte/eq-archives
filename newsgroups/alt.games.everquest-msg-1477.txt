I finally started smithing last night.  Apparently I had 15 practice points
put in.  I bought 65 flasks of water, and ended up buying 130 bricks of ore.
Combining 1 water and 2 ore I made a total of 47 (out of 65) metal bits.  I
then got my skill up to 21 and went and bought some scallar molds to make
scallars as I read on a smithing guide.  I then noticed the time and decided
that I'd better /camp for now.  I've got just over 5 platinum left and had
failed once because I forgot the water, but have 46 metal bits and the molds
cost me 6s 6c and water 1s 3c so thats 7s 9c per attempt times 46 attempts
(to raise skill 20 points) which will cost me 3p 6g 3s 4c.  I also plan to
make myself a skinning knife when my skill reaches 40 (don't want to fail
since it uses more parts).  I've already spent 130 times 6s 6c (8p 5g 8s)
and another 65 times 1s 3c (8g 4s 5c). The metal bits using 2 ore (1g 3s 2c)
and one water cost me a total of 1g 4s 5c per attempt and times 65 attempts
I spent 9p 4g 2s 5c.  So to get to 41 will have cost me at least 13p 1g 2s
5c (including that one mold I messed up on).  But I did make sure that I'm
going to have enough to buy my LV14 spells (just under 72 platinum pieces -
being a druid is EXPENSIVE - spent about 60 or more pp so far and now
another 72).
    So what else should I work on in smithing?  Which items would be
cheapest yet best to make.  Once I start making weapons couldn't I turn out
some profit there, or at least make alot of my money back (even selling to
vendors I'm amible to)?  I do plan on making my own sword though.
