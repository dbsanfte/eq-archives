i would say that richard is pretty much correct in his assumption, only i 
would raise that percentage a bit higher.  there are other classes other 
than druids that are quite capable at soloing at most levels;  such as 
bards, necros, monks, etc.  These are just people's main characters.  
Even those who usually group probably have alternate solo characters.  
Almost forgot those who, what's the term, multi-box?...might as well add 
those people since they're controlling two characters at once (much like 
controlling a pet).  If you add all those people who solo together, i'm 
sure you'd get, at least, "half of the players".

as for the nature of everquest...sure, it's social but, that doesn't mean 
it was designed for grouping.  if it were, i'm sure they would've made 
the game so that one could only fight if grouped with one or more people.  
Plus, if they did design it for just grouping, they did a horrible job.  
The groups are small, not much of an exp bonus when you are grouped 
(probably changed now, after how many years since eq went live), non-
tanks completely screw up their defense/offense when grouping regularly, 
groups in a raid may miss out on exp and loot, and so on.  so let's end 
this little fantasy about everquest being designed for grouping.  

everquest was first and foremost designed to make money.  To do that, 
they designed the game with versatility in order to make it a fun 
experience for ANYONE who plays.  Regardless of if they play solo or 
grouped, pk or non-pk, gnomes to ogres, whatever.  i'm almost happy that 
this incident occurred.  this little experiment should've proven to 
verant just how dangerous it was to alienate those who solo.  to nerf 
solo abilities would only drive people away from eq; possibly eq2 and 
star wars galaxies...and doing that would go against their one true 
vision of making money.
