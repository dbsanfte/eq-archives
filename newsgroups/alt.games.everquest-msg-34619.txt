I roleplay my Erudite Necro as an intelligent, cogent individual, just
one with a set of morals that would make other blanch. Lawful Evil I
guess. Think Hannibal Lector - an educated, intelligent man who doesn't
at first glance appear to be a serial killer, you have to dig deeper.

Rather than running around being an asshole, he is simply a great
believer in the end justifying the means. He doesn't necessarily
consider himself to be evil, just enlightened - privy to the dark truths
that the other sheep in society are too ignorant or afraid to embrace.
Necromancy is simply a school of magic that his colleagues in the arcane
arts are too small-minded to comprehend, a bit like how a geneticist
into cloning human beings might be frustrated by lefty, moral scientists
into ecology or the like.

He will perform 'good' actions, but more out of self-interest than a
desire to help people (I'm not a goody-goody healer, but if I don't use
the black arts to manipulate the fate of this individual so he doesn't
die on me with dark empathy etc, he won't be able to help me further my
own goals, by helping to keep me alive in this dungeon etc).
