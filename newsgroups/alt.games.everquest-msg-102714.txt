You are making one faital assumation here that we are unable to prove. That
assumation being that the price of $9.98 per month is the price sufficent to
compensate the cost for the infra-structure needed to service 400,000 user base
and not something less. It is often the case that many companies set a price
based on the theories of Supply and Demand rather then Cost and Profit. They
make a study and determine the price that a market place is willing to pay (the
measurement of the demand for the product/service) and then make another study
to determine the "average" and "peak" loads of the service. They supply what
they can for the average and peak loads and hoping that the price will stay
withing the Supply-Demand curve. If it does not, they do not supply the service
since they will be unable to "provide the service at a reasonable price".

To make it more simple, we do not know if the $9.98 (or in the new case, $12.98)
per month is the price to provide the service to 400,000 subscribers or
something much much less then that. It is most likely that the price is
sufficient to provide the service for something much much less then 400,000
subscribers. 400,000 active on-line subscribers would be very difficult to
provide service for with only 15 machines per server world, especially if the
ALL the 400,000 subscribers have to come through the same log-in server.
