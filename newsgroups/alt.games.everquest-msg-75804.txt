The biggest reason to re-format and install clean is just that - it
cleans up the most important, and most neglected, and most
ill-tempered part of Windows - your registry.

After a while, with the install and uninstall of programs, your
registry becomes this huge all consuming monster that everything
relies on for information, and, if the registry is wrong, you are in
some serious trouble.

It also removes a lot of crap off of your hard drive that you probably
haven't used in months.  And, lastly, it puts a clean image of
everything back on again.... drivers, windows, programs, etc.  One
that you shouldn't need to de-frag for any length of time.
