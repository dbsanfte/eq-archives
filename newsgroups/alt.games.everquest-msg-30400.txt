I was trying to estimate how much better the name Aerdna Winddancer was,
then say that gnome wizard I ran into named "Seymore Bootie". I started off
thinking, "Winddancer is about 1,000 times better" then started thinking,
"No, maybe 10,000 times better" then my brain locked up with a general
protection fault error message. Fine name on its own and stellar compared to
the competition. Asset to the game kind of thing; makes my playing
experience much more enjoyable.
