  That was a well written and enjoyable review, thanks
for sharing.

  I was jazzed when SWG was first announced... then
started to lose major interest after reading a few Raph
Koster interviews and hearing some of the stuff that was
leaking out during beta.... but your review has got me
seriously rethinking giving it a try.  The PvP you described
actually sounds like it *might* be interesting (depending on
how much power the griefers will wield) and the tradeskill
stuff sounds neat.  The Raph Koster interviews still have me
a little scared that we're looking at Ultima Online 2.0 though...
