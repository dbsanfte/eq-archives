I have heard, but have not tested, that since you're officially
an NPC while LD, you also have the NPC invulnerability to drowning.

In any case, if you're talking about plain-vanilla crash-while-zoning,
then don't worry, because your character doesn't "emerge
on the other side" of the zone at all and then hang around LD,
it simply fails to arrive in the new zone at all until you reconnect,
so there's no risk of drowning or being attacked by mobs.
