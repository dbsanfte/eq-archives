  Well, if their purpose is to get the guilds equipt with as much primal
velium weapons as possible, the longer these agreements go on, the more
primal velium people get, and presumably the more happy people are.  Yeah,
as time goes on, the better the chance that someone will say "screw it" and
"screw you" to everyone else and break the agreement, but they do so at some
cost to their reputation on the server.  Better that the agreement goes on
for several months than that no agreement gets struck, fewer people get
those weapons.
