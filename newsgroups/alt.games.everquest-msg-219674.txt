Looks like on test, Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity has been changed, it is 
now a 3 tick duration instead of instant, and regens on each tick.  I am 
hoping that Lucy is wrong, but, according to Lucy, stacking with the 
clarity line will be an issue now.  Of course, song and spell stacking has 
always been a bit weird, so, would not surprise me if it stacks despite the 
fact that both put the same effect type in the same slot.
