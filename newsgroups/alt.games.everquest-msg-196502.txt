I wish SONY would bring legitimate Casinos into the game.  That would be way
cool!!!  Put it in the desert outside of Freeport.  It would be like
Everquest's version of Vegas.  Screw the politically correct response of "We
cannot have gambling in the game because it sets a bad example."  Excuse me
but if that is the argument then do away with all fo the KILLING that is in
the game and Sony's "tongue and cheek" approach to things of the occult.
Frankly, going into a zone where you could play card games for PP or
roulette would be killer.  Even have slot machines that the Gnomes built.

Have a daily lottery or monthly Power Ball lottery.  Cost 100 pp per ticket
for a chance to win 100K pp.  Or do a lottery for some Uber Weapon every two
weeks or so.  Ok.  Maybe the Lottery is taking awy from the Fantasy aspect
of the game.  Still, I like the idea of a Zone devoted to Casinos.
