HuH bad, a "me too post",bear with me.  :)

I started my MMORPG career with UO,but EQ gave me
the "wow effect" too,seeing the bridge between NK/EK
or the unbeleivable huge West Karanas for the first time
was exciting. 
I still enjoy zones like Sanctu Seru for their great
architecture,too bad the zone is a wasteland with no
real use.
