I don't know your tastes, so I'll shoot pretty wide. :)

-Neverwinter Nights. If you aren't sick to your stomach of RPGs, of 
course. Download also a bunch of player-made scenarios, as the main 
campaign won't last you three months.

-Grand Theft Auto III. *much* better than the PS2 version. You'll keep 
playing it long after you finish all the missions. Just driving around 
and getting into trouble is more fun than most games ever released.

-Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. Actually, THPS 2 is better, but I don't know 
if it's available for the PC. Any game that takes your brain to a place 
where five seconds is an eternity can't be all bad. You'll need a 
digital (not analog) joypad, though. Or mad keyboard skillz. :)

-If you like shooting games, I'd recommend Soldier of Fortune (the 
original, the sequel sucks choda), No One Lives Forever (the original, I 
haven't played the sequel at all) and Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast.

-And of course, you can always buy Battlefield 1942 and spend those 
three months practicing offline (in single-player mode) in order to kick 
much butt online when you come back. :)

As far as shareware and freeware goes, give this one a try:

I'm sure I'll think of a few others, but these should give you a few 
ideas.
