the gold does not have everything, gold consists of:
everquest- the elgends of Kunark
velious expansionpack
luclin expansion pack.

still missing pop.

gold edition comes with niceseperate maps and a mousemat to thin to use but
it looks nice.

Where it conecerns the original poster, everquest luclin expansionpack
consists of 3 cdroms alone so it's doubtfull you got that one. Most likely
is as some other poster said, the old world of norrath (antonica odus
faydwer and kunark). If you really like the game order gold, if you think
you are getting addicted order pop staightaway as well. Pop is for lvl46+
but has one zone wich avoids waiting for portals to get to luclin and boats
to get from one continent to another. (It really is a big timesaver) plus
most spells are available in the planes of knowledge. (the only plane that
does not have a 46+ restriction).
It would make sense that they just gave the old edition away, as they did so
on various other situations by allowing ppl to make copies for friends and
giving out free regnumbers.

There is a way to figure it out though. Ask a frindly druid to port to
nexus. If you are left behind, you don't have it.
