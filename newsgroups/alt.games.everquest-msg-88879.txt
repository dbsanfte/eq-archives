    If it's a Mithril Quill (4/19 HP 20), it comes from Sol A. And yes, it's
a nice weapon at those levels.

    Some others have been saying to go with a holdable item, like a Stein.
The Stein is a very nice item, and I can't recommend it enough. IF you don't
yet want to go with no weapon, though, a fair weapon is a Rukgus Sticker.
6/25 STR 3 WIS/INT 2 piercer. If you're in the Freeport area, then shoot a
tell to Stumppuller the paladin. I know for a fact that he has one on one of
his "stuff I picked up" mules, and I'm sure he can sell it to you cheap.
