>
> 1.2    Q:What is the newsgroup for?
>
> A: For the discussion of all things related the game of Everquest.
>
>
>
> 2.    Questions about Everquest
>
> 2.1    Q: What is Everquest?
>
> A: EverQuest is a real 3D massively multiplayer online RPG. Another
equally
> accurate way of describing EverQuest is to call it a graphical MUD.
>
>
>
> 2.2    Q: What do I need to play Everquest?
>
> A: These are the minimum system requirements needed to run Velious, which
is
> the latest expansion for Everquest; ie, if you meet these requirements,
you
>
> will be able to play Everquest and any of the expansions.
>
> The minimum requirements are: Windows� 95/98/00, a Pentium� 200 processor,
> 64 MB of RAM, Direct 3D or Glide compliant graphics accelerator card with
8
> MB of video RAM, a DirectX 7.0a compatible sound card, 28.8k bps internet
> connection, 2X speed CD-ROM, and 600MB+ of hard drive space. Naturally,
the
> recommended specs are a bit higher, including a Pentium� 350 or greater
> processor, 128 MB or RAM, 16 MB of video RAM, and a 4X speed CD-ROM.
>
> You will also need a valid credit card.
>
>
> 2.3    Q: What are these expansions I keep hearing about?
>
> A: There have been two expansion packs to EverQuest so far, the Ruins of
> Kunark, and the Scars of Velious.
>
>
> 2.4    Q: What is the Ruins of Kunark?
>
> A: The Ruins of Kunark was the first EverQuest expansion to be
> released.  This expansion included a new continent with many new zones
> to adventure in, lots of new dungeons, items, mobs, quests and spells,
> and also included a new playable race of characters, the Iksar
> lizardmen.  People with this expansion also were allowed to advance
> beyond level 50 (up to level 60,) which was previously impossible.
> People without Kunark could buy an expansion pack only for about $20,
> but it also along with the original EverQuest game for around $40 (US).
This
> way, new EverQuest players could buy both the "base" EverQuest game, and
> the expansion at once.
>
>
>
> 2.5    Q: What is the Scars of Velious?
>
> A: The Scars of Velious is an expansion similar to the Ruins of Kunark,
> including another new continent with new zones, dungeons, items, mobs,
> quests, spells, level 60 cap, ect. but it is geared towards higher level
> players (level 30+) and does not include a new playable race, and is not
> available with the "base" EverQuest game.  You must own EverQuest before
> you can play Scars of Velious, but you do not need the Ruins of Kunark.
> The Scars of Velious does not include the Ruins of Kunark.  This
> expansion also includes some upgrades to the user interface.  It retails
> for about $20 (US)
>
>
> 2.6    What is EQ Macros and where can I get it?
>
> EQMacros is a program which is no longer available. The purpose of
> this program was to provide a means whereby users could circumvent
> some of the more tedious aspects of the game. It also dispensed with
> some of the disadvantages certain characters had, such as night
> blindness.
>
> Verant has required that the author of EQMacros cease distribution,
> and has stated that anyone caught using it will have their account
> banned.
>
> This is a controversial subject in this newsgroup, and has been argued to
> death. Posting questions on this subject is generally frowned upon.

> 3.    Questions about gameplay
>
>
> 3.1    Q: What is the best race/class combo to play
>
> A: To answer this question you have to ask yourself what is important to
> you. If you're familiar with other RPGs and games of this nature, you
> probably know that each character will have his or her strengths and
> weaknesses, and that no single class/race combo will give you all the good
> with none of the bad.  The question to ask is not what is the best
> race/class combo is the best, but to ask which is best for YOU.  The best
> way to answer this question is to learn about all of the classes and
races,
> and make your decision based on that knowledge.
>
>
> 3.2     Q: Is there any way for me to change the deity I worship, or to
> become
> Agnostic?
>
> A: No, sorry.  The only way you can "change" your deity is to delete
> your character and start over.
>
>
> 3.3    Q: What is this "Tome of Order and Discord" book I have in my
> inventory?  What should I do with it?
>
> A: Destroy it immediately.  If you give this book to the Priest of
> Discord (there is a Priest of Discord in or nearby any city that you can
> start off in) then you will join the ranks of "Discord"... you become a
> "player killer."
>
>
> 3.4    Q: Well, what if I want to be a player killer?
>
> A: Becoming a player killer has great consequences that you may not be
> completely understanding of by reading the tome.  A player killer can
> kill other player killers, but cannot kill or be killed by non-player
> killers (with the exception of in a duel.)  Also, and more importantly,
> if you are a player killer, you will NOT be able to receive most forms
> of aid from other players, nor will you be able to aid them.  This means
> that you cannot be healed or "buffed" by anybody who is not a player
> killer.  Since more than 99% of the players on normal servers are not
> player killers this totally ruins your ability to get in a group beyond
> level 15 or so.  If you want to be a player killer, play on a PvP
> server.
>
>
> 3.5    Q: Oops!  I gave the priest of discord the book, without fully
> understanding the consequences.  Is there any way I can undo my
> decision.
>
> A: Yes, but honestly you may be better of just starting over.  Use the
> /petition command and explain that you do not want to be a playerkiller
> any longer.  After a wait (probably a very long wait) a GM will come to
> you, probably in the form of the "Priest of Order" and assign you a
> quest that is "appropriate for your level" to undo your player killer
> status.  By most accounts, the quests that are assigned by the Priest of
> Order are obscenely difficult and will take quite a bit of time and
> effort to complete.  It's better than nothing, however, and you may luck
> out and get a relatively easy quest.  I wouldn't bet on it though.
>
>
> 3.6    Q: I want to transfer one character from one EverQuest account I
have
> to another.  Can I do this, and if so, how?
>
> A: No, sorry.  Verant does not allow this, partially to discourage from
> selling their characters using services such as eBay.
>
>
> 3.7    Q: How do I alt+tab out of EverQuest and return to the game?  It
> would
> really be helpful if I could use Notepad or the web while I'm playing.
>
> A: Unfortunately, in an effort to make it more difficult for somebody to

> discover if you accidentally do so), but it is impossible to get back
> into the game.

>
> 3.8    Q: What is a hotkey?

> A: A key that is customised to perform an in-game function
>
>
> 3.9    Q: How do I make a hotkey?

> 3.11    Q: What is a social?

> A: Making a social allows you to execute line commands and say

>
>
> 3.12    Q: How do I make a social?
> A: On the main screen, press the Socials button.  Several buttons will
> appear with pre-made social key commands.  You can edit a hotkey by
> right-clicking it.  To edit a line of a social, just click it and start
> typing.  You can edit the name of the social in the same manner.  When
> you finish, you can make your social into a hotkey.  When you activate
> the social, it will execute whatever you typed in on the lines of the
> social key.  For example, you can make a social that looks like this:
>
> /afk
> /groupsay I'm going away from keyboard for a sec, guys.
>
>   And if you activated this social key, it would flag you AFK, and you'd

>
> 3.13    Q: How do I change the colors of the text?
>
> A: See the eqmanual_supplement.doc file in your EverQuest directory.

> http://www.cws.org/~pasketti/eqini.html
>
>
> 3.14    Q: Where can I get an up-to-date list of commands and/or emotes?
>
> A: Try the eqmanual_supplement.doc file in your EverQuest directory.
> Also, if you visit http://everquest.allakhazam.com/
> and scroll down for the links to "Commands..." you will find 3
> selections, "Emotes...", "Game Commands...", and "Chat Terms...".
>
>
> 3.15    Q: What are all these abbreviations and acronyms?  What does it
all
> mean?
>
> A: This site has an excellent glossary
> http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm
>
>
> 3.16    Q:Where should I hunt at my particular leve/class/race?
>
> A:The following sites have good charts on this.
>  www.eqatlas.com/huntguidelevel.html
> http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Level_Chart.html
>
>
> 3.17    Q:Why can mobs hit through walls?

> WTF?......
>
> Mobs and other NPCs in EQ are controlled by computer AI, which is
> no substitute for a <supposedly> intelligent human being controlling

> aggro-range etc, and don't really employ sophisticated tactics and
