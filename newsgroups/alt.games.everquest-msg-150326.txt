Many people left EQ for DAoC. Some stayed, but many came back. Most of
those that came back felt that there was not enough content in DAoC,
and that once you hit the higher levels the only thing to do was PvP
between realms. Here is a quick list as to the pros and cons expressed
by players of both games...

DAoC = Better graphics and animations
DAoC = Faster player advancement (You level quicker with less
"downtime")
DAoC = Easier tradeskill advancement
DAoC = lower system requirements

EQ = TONS more content (Zones, items, quests, tradeskills)
EQ = More to do in the high-end game and PvP is not required to enjoy
the high-end content.

I would be willing to bet that if you liked DAoC you will like (if not
love) EQ.

You system is a little light on memory. I would advise you to pick up
another 256mb of RAM (for a total of 512), and you should be good to
go. You shouldn't have to spend more than $25-45.00US for a 256mb
stick.
