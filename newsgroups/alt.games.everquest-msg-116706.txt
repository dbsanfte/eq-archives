What often happens is that the GMs show up as NPCs and try
to run some kind of roleplaying event or quest.  Many players
try to talk to the NPC so they can figure out or play along
with the event.

Then, a few dozen d3wd players, who have never figured out
that there can be more to the game then "kill mob, loot mob",
screw up the proceedings by attacking the NPC, shouting
stupid things, and generally reducing the event to a
free for all.

The GMs will try to continue the roleplay event for a while
longer, then finally realize it's futile, and go on a rampage
against the attackers -- and anyone else who happens to
still be around.

Another GM event down the tubes...
