    The rare drop, the Platinum Dragon Totem, also isn't all that well-known
or valuable, and the room is pretty far off the beaten track as far as doing
the other rares. There ARE good drops in the room of quest components for
Temple of Sol Ro quests, though. The Sparkle Purse also drops in the
shaman's room, and turning that in after you leave nets a LARGE chunk of XP.
