Except that you do eventually take damage from those damn spiders,
especially on the pull, so some ability to heal is nice.  I guess bind
wounds works, but it's not exactly fast.  Then again neither is bard
regen, but we've certainly been able to keep on top of it with Catata
and Nivs.  (Gives about 50hp/tick regen)
And I wouldn't call my example wild, I've done it several times and
most of the decent bards I know who frequent Velks have done it.
Velks has sort of turned into *the* place for bards recently, saw 6 of
us there yesterday.  I guess it's because spider groups don't have a
problem with bards doing CC, and kobald groups don't have a problem
with known bards.  Seb is still an issue for some camps, though I
can't figure out why, other than Juggs.  (OK, it's possible to have
two 56 reavers spawn at King at the same time, but only seen that
once, and the enchanter couldn't get dictate to stick until after
first was almost dead anyway.)
