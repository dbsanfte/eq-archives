for what its worth, and you probably know this, but unless you are
behind a firewall the viruses can get in. Microsoft has written a good
enough OS that no user interaction beyond plugging it in and turning
it on is enough to get it infected.

for myself, I hate AV software... bloated, slow, and regularly
ineffective. I prefer firewalls, periodic full virus scans, and good
backups, sensible avoidance of MS email clients and zero tolerance for
unrequested attachments. Overall its served me well... I have never
been infected beyond picking up the odd  infected file via Kazaa which
I run in a virtual pc with an A/V package... :) and I don't have to
put up with the system drag AV incurrs on your system.
