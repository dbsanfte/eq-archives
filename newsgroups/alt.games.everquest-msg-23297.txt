Packets from your computer have to know how to get to
THAT server, not one right beside it.   The fact that you
can get to one beside it is meaningless, other than to
say that their (and your) general connection, etc. is
working properly.

That one server, for example, could have a bad entry in a
router halfway between your computer and theirs.   Or a
corrupt DNS entry in your ISP's DNS server.  Or any other
of a multitude of causes.

Simplest answer:   there's 617 people on Prexus, but YOU
can't get in.   Assume the GM knows that.   What's he going
to tell you?   Easy -- it's your ISP.   And he's probably right.

Just as a guess, there'd be plenty of people complaining (or
just asking about it, if you will) in chat if the server was down.
If you didn't see other people doing that during a reasonable
stay in chat, the server is probably okay.

(Note:  "Your ISP" refers to any and all providers of connectivity
between you and them.   Of course, your ISP doesn't provide
all that connectivity.   But they're the ones who are supposed
to fix your connectivity problem.)
