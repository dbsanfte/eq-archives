Yes, they can tell, or at least get a good idea.  That popup stopper
works, from what I've seen watching it (it's the one I use when I get
tired of popups), by closing the popup window as soon as the browser
opens it (usually this is before it is even drawn on the screen, which
is why you usually don't see it, although sometimes you see it briefly
flash into existence).  Since that happens way faster than the browser
can fetch the contents of the popup, even over a very fast connection,
the contents of the popup is not downloaded.  The server logs will
show your IP address downloading the main page, and then *won't* show
your IP address downloading the popup contents, so they'll know you
either used something to block the popup, or you left the page before
it had a chance to show up.

Besides, no one pays anymore for just showing an ad.  Even if you used
a popup stopper that fetched the ad in the background and discarded
it, the advertiser would know that you didn't click on it.

With television, the ads are not shown at the same time as the
program.  If you don't leave the room during the ad to go to the
bathroom, or get a snack, you are probably at least somewhat paying
attention.  With a banner ad on a web page, the banner ad is competing
with the content of the web page.  It is much more likely, it seems
for me, for the banner ad to be completely ineffective.

Also, ads on the web generally have a different aim than ads on TV.
When you are watching TV, you are generally in no position to go out
and buy the product.  TV ads are trying to get the product or brand
name into your mind so that later, when you are out shopping and see
the product, you'll buy it.  Web ads, on the other hand, are trying to
get you to go shop *now*.

For example, I just went to www.yahoo.com, and noted the banner ad
that was shown.  It was for an online casino.  I'm not interested in
online casinos now, so did not click on it.  Suppose a week from now,
I become interested in using the services of an online casino, and
even remember that I saw a banner for one at yahoo.  Am I going to go
to their site?  Nope...I don't know the URL.  I didn't memorize it
from the banner.  Compare to, say, seeing a TV ad for a new flavor of
potato chip.  A week from now, when I'm shopping at the store, if I
say to myself "I'm getting tired of the same old snacks...I want
something new!", and then remember that potato chip ad, the ad did its
job.  With the web ad for the casino, getting the impression did
nothing for them...the ad only works if I click it.  With the TV ad
for potato chips, the impression does work.
