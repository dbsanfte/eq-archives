Well, IMO, it's a bad idea to ask for every drop that might be an upgrade to
you, on several levels.

First it's a bad idea on an emotional level.  I understand where you're
coming from, that you're just saying it's an upgrade... not that you expect
to get every upgrade that drops.    I don't think it makes you a loot whore.
You're just giving them what you think is 'the information they need to know
to make an informed decision'.  But emotionally, I don't think they're going
to see it that way.  Even if rationally they know what you're doing, it
almost -has- to be somewhere in the back of thier mind "What the fuck?  This
guy asks for loot off every single fucking kill.  I guess thats all he
really cares about."

On a functional level, it's a very bad idea.   I've never been on a loot
council, and I wouldn't really want to be.   It has to be an _incredibly_
stressful job, trying to balance out everyones contributions with the
rewards that they're given, and factoring in where the item would best help
the guild.   And taking shit from one side or another no matter what you
decide.

What you're doing by announcing every minor upgrade, whether its a dream
item or an "eh" item,  is essentially making thier job harder.   It's got to
be already very hard to determine which of the five people who really want
that item should end up walking away with it, without having to factor in 10
or 15 other people also saying "well, it would be a minor upgrade, sure I'll
take it." .... or even worse, all 20 just saying "It's an upgrade" without
differentiating how much or anything else.  And repeating the same scene
after each mob dies.

Actually there are three different approaches.  Although I think only the
two you mentioned are really workable.

/random is the third one, and IMO "/random is the debil".    It encourages
and rewards the worst kind of sunshine player(2), and absolutely guarentees
a complete screw to every single person who is there just to be nice or help
out.    And it seems that the gods of /random take a very perverse delight
in ensuring that rewards tend to go to the least deserving, least
contributing, most assinine, least needy person present at the raid.

/award (loot council) is my middle solution.  /award is workable, but in the
long run it has a *lot* of baggage attached to it.  /award is inherently
prone to extreme bouts of drama.   As impossible as it is to find a loot
council that is 1000% impartial and fair, it's even more impossible to
convince others of that.   Someone will *always* walk away from a raid
thinking that somehow they're getting screwed.  Whether they are or not.
People will whine because their contribution isn't getting noticed, and
whether it was being noticed or not, every time after that that they receive
loot, it appears that whining *worked*, which encourages others to piss and
moan about how they haven't been recognized. Fights and bad feelings
generally ensue.

DKP is mostly my favorite.  It rewards those that are contributing, and is
much less prone to drama, although there always is some.   Abuse can be a
problem, but careful creation of the rules (and adherence to them) can
eliminate abuse or at least keep it to a minimum, whereas in a /award
system, the abuse is almost hardcoded in.  I also prefer it if someone does
retain a bit of control, in the ability to step in manually when the system
does go haywire.   A check to keep the 500 DKP warrior from taking
Uber_Bow_01 as a 10 hp upgrade over the 300 DKP ranger who needs it as a DPS
increaser, or to keep the mage from taking a 30 damage +30% backstab dagger
away from a rogue to use as a 10 int boost (when he's already at the int
cap).   (1)







(1) One of the compormises the E'ci public DKP system worked out was the
idea that certain drops were partially class restricted.  For instance if a
haste item dropped, anyone could bid on it up to 100 points maximum.   Once
it was over that level, only melees could continue to bid due to the special
effectivness it has for them.  The theory being that if the melee wasn't
willing to spend 100 points on the drop, they either didn't want it enough
or hadn't earned it enough to get special priority.  (100 points was a
decent amount, but not excessive.   Most kills were 1-3 points per boss,
with the occasional 5 pointer for major raids.   Most raiders had 100 - 150
points available at any time, with the extreme hardcore hovering in the
300's.)

(2) Sunshine player - Think "Fair weather friend".  Only raids when the kill
has something in it for them personally or thier very close friend(s), and
doesn't give two shits about anyone else in the guild.   (I actually
nicknamed one of the clerics in an old guild as Sunshine.  I don't think she
ever figured it out.)
