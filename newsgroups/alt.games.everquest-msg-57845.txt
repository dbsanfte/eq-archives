And Ariel Sharon tells you to put your "demands" where the sun don't shine.
How do you like them apples, Booby?

Get it straight, you twit-haired schmuck: Israel has every right to claim
and keep every grain of sand and clump of grass that soaked up Israeli blood
in wars of defense against Arab aggression on her UN partitioned borders.
When those Arab nations and the Palestinians decided that those borders
didn't exist, and tresspassed over them, then you're damned right they no
longer existed and it was up to Israel to redraw them according to an
Israeli requirement of defense against further invasion and *most of all* in
recompense for the cost of Israeli blood and life.

Land for Life.  Land for Blood. She will hold to those lands, you can bet
your life, God damn your sissy eyes, in payment for every Israeli man, woman
and child who suffered death of a slit throat all those years from even
before 1947 as the dagger bearing hands of the fedayeen came creeping and
crawling like the Manson Family, like sand-rats to deny Jews our rightful
claim to the ancient homeland of our people!  Piss in your eyes. MY people.
My blood.  My life. That land is mine and I will beat any man or woman down
to the ground with my bare fists who says it isn't, even if it is true that
it is my father alone who is Jewish; I'll still smack the face of any Goy or
Jew with the nuts to stand in front of me and deny that I am not my father's
son. Ya sonsofbitches.  Just try it to my face.  I'll show you what a real
Jew can do.

Take your "demands" and stick 'em, Putz. Stick a little Auschwitz ash up
your nose and get a big buzz on this:  Show your face in Israel with your
"demands" and see where they get you, ya whining, cowardly, back-stabbing
schlemiel.  They'd get you a well-deserved end of existence on this earth
should you speak your sniveling "demands" in the wrong face, chump.

You and your worthless "demands"?  As Benjamin Netanyahu has said, all you
are doing is Osama bin Laden's work, as you give him exactly what he wanted
from the WTC, you traitor, you yellow-bellied pack of cowards, you God damn
Benedict Arnolds, you Quisling, Judas sonsofbitches with your yellow-striped
"Peace in our Time" Lord Chamberlain snot.

Get the news:  Israel's claims to all that land she now holds, in the Golan
and the West Bank is relative to her history the same as the US claim on
Texas and the Alamo.  And baby, this IS Israel's Last Stand at the Alamo,
and all Santa Ana's armies and all of his men, will not prevail in the end,
not so long as Ben "Sam Houston" Netanyahu is standing by.

The so-called "Palestinians" have no right to any "homeland"--they gave that
up when they were not satisfied with the UN partition and started murdering
Israelis in their beds.  That's all over.  Now they have one choice, to
become good law-abiding citizens of Israel or get their filthy
rock-throwing, murdering asses out.  If you think two nations can exist
within the bounds of one country, then one might suppose that you are the
sort who invites the man next door in to share your marriage bed. Eh? That's
the kind of perversion your thought amounts to.  No two nations can share a
claim to one land, no two husbands the comfort and pleasures of one marriage
bed.  Are you nuts?

Yes.  Yes you are.  We didn't put up with it here in the Civil War or in the
Indian Wars and Israel won't put up with it there. This is the Cowboys and
Indians in Israel, this is that part of her history, and it's none of your
damned business.  Keep your stinking aid money and right along with, your
nose out of things that are none of your concern. This is nation-building,
it is Manifest Destiny, it is the Spanish American War and the annexation of
Puerto Rico, you lying hypocrites:  it is the same bloody awful business and
it will be fought to it's conclusion, with your support or without it.

Get your nose out of Israel's business, take your US aid money and shove it
where the sun don't shine. Israel will get by.  Israel will survive.  Israel
can drop a nuke on your head in case you want to keep on wondering why we
just keep on saying:   Never Again.

<Boom!  Poof!>

Have a little toot of Auschwitz Ash.

Ha-haaaaaaaaaaaaa!
