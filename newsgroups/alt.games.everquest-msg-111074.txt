	I don't really like the druid epic. Mind you, I'm years away from
it, but the direction that Verant took the druid class bothered me,
because I always saw druids as being concerned with the "big
picture".  Lone wolves, perhaps, but them being the ultimate solo class
(or near to it), has nothing to do with the roleplaying aspects of what
druids could/should be. In my little world this is.  *cough*

	So!  I had a lovely idea of what I'd like the epic to be (and I'm
going to bore you with my idea, whee!).  Not some arbitrary curved sword
that can make people writhe in torment at a whim (where _did_ the scimitar
come from anyway??).  But rather, a staff.  Two handed or one handed, I
don't really care.  I suppose I'd prefer two handed for roleplaying
reasons, but I think I'd _really_ get hit about the shoulders for taking
away druids' secondary slot.

	Anyhow...the effect:  turns the druid into a massive tree (or
shrub, or root system if you are underground...anything big and planty
works for me).   Any group members within a certain radius of the tree get
a wallop of druid-type buffs (hp regen comes to mind, strength, increased
resistences...they get mana regen at high levels, no?), and any aggressive
mobs get a wallop of debuffs.

	The up-sides...well, your group is real darn happy.  I'd be in
favor of having the said druid being completely rooted and unable to cast
more spells while it is in effect, in return for the buffs being VERY
GOOD.   Their role on a raid would be "stand here and be leafy"...not very
thrilling, but they'd be valuable, and from what I hear, raids aren't
about personal glory anyhow.

	Yes yes yes, this is probably unrealistic.  What druid would want
to have an epic effect that was completely useless while soloing, stuck
them in one place, and didn't do anything but help others?
