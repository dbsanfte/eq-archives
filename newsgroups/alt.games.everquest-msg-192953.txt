You assume wrong.

You are also wrong about the usefulness of the CDs, they can be used by 
anyone with an EQ account to install a copy of EQ on their system.  The 
software on your PC and your account are completely independant.  You can 
go over to a friends house, and play EQ on your account using their install 
of EQ from their CDs.  It's a good idea to hang onto the CDs in case you 
ever need to do a complete reinstall.
