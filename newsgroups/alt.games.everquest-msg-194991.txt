POK doesn't have these spells, nor do the regular vendors in shadowhaven.  The
interesting thing about them has always been that they aren't on regular shaman
vendors anywhere; barbarians have to venture out into Everfrost, Trolls and
Ogres had a vendor in the middle of Innothule, apparantly Iksar have one way
down in the depths of the tunnels under their shaman guild, I have no idea where
the Vah Shir or Frogloks get theirs   (sounds like same spot as the trolls used
to use for the latter?)  The first two vendors used to be a bit scary to get to
for level 5 shaman, there were actual mobs out there you'd have to move thru to
get to your vendor.  Sounds like the Iksar one is safe to get to, which seems
odd to me, but then again it didn't take much more than some "stay high on the
walls" sensibility for my level one barbarian mule to get to the Everfrost one
for me.
