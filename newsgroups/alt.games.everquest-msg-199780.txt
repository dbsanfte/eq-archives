    In my Bazaar, Sinew Tied is in the 2 K range and a steal for the price.

    Pet Canni is important. Heck, just saving mana on that first summons of
the day is important!

    Why? He has Mana Preservation III on his shoulders. And I only suggested
it if you were willing to farm the components, which given what a POS PoNB
is wasn't certain.

    Shhhhh, I sell them! And 4 K for a droppable hat with that much INT, a
good amount of CHA for the enchanter crowd, and even some HPs/MANA/saves
isn't so bad. It only takes two silks, so if you wanted I'm sure Team Bot
could go farm them and find a guild tradeskiller to do the final combine.

    Ring of Lightning > all. After that Signet, RoWinter, DWB. Signet would
be a bit pricey, but might be farmable.

    And it's WIZ-only. ;-)

    That seems a bit stiff, but remember that this is one of the few
droppable INT-caster ranged slot items with reasonable HP/MANA. That it has
stats and some resists is a big plus.

    You could always see if you can pick one up killing stuff, too. Just
need a PoS flag.

    Right click DD? The boots off Velk, and scant else.
