Something else that seems to happen in DAoC along those same lines, though I
haven't nailed down exactly how it works, is it seems that if you are solo
and attack a mob that a group is fighting, when the mob dies you get a share
of the experience in proportion to the amount of damage you've done.  It
*seems* that way, anyway.  I'm really not sure how exp and looting rights
are determined yet.  However, this is one thing that EQ seems to have gotten
right, so if DAoC is trying to improve on it they may be making the classic
mistake of trying to fix something that isn't broken.

Best Regards
