If you want to sell your account it is probably as good a way as any.
If you are selling it you don't care what SOE thinks anyway. There is
nothing illegal about selling it.

If you want to buy one, you have the same risks no matter how you do
it. Even if it works out, the seller can later use original account
info, like their CD reg key, to get it back. A buyer never really owns
that sellers account.
