They should make it so that if a group kills the same mobs repeatedly, that
group becomes PvP-enabled, with no level restriction.  Then, you'd have
griefers camping the campers. :-)

More seriously, they should consider a bonus system like DAoC uses.  When
you come to a fresh camp in DAoC and kill all the mobs, you get a big XP
bonus.  You'll also get a bonus on the respawn.  (And maybe the
re-respawn...I think they can adjust how long the bonus lasts).  Then the
bonus goes away.

The bonus is big enough that moving makes a big difference.  I played a
Necro solo to 50 (Necros are the fastest-leveling solo class in the game),
and the entire point was to reach 50 (accounts that reach 50 are allowed to
start new characters at 20, which is great for people like me that want to
try a lot of classes, and don't want to keep doing the newbie levels over
and over and over), so maximizing XP rate was very important.  Going on big
circuits around a whole region gave a lot more XP than sticking to one camp
or trying to bounce between two or three camps.
