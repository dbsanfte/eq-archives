I can't answer your question, in fact I'd like to know as well.  I can say
though that 4 (actually took me 2 hours to get pottery to 125) hours is 110%
worth it to make those thurg potions.  Get your skill up and keep a ton of
the materials in the bank to make more.  One thing I have learned it that
they are addicting, and its a pain to have to stock up all the time.  Even
if you get shaman made ones, I would advise making Thurg ones.. it's like
having 2 bind points.
