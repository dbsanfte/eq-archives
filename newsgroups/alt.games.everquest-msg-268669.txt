When a failure pops up in the crafting window, clicking the skill with
the same icon will "counter" it. You'll still suffer quality loss, but
not as much and (I think) you won't suffer the progress loss that
usually results from certain failures. The big thing is that this will
also counter the failures that tend to damage you and can lead to
crafting occasionally being lethal to the unobservant crafter.

Clicking them without a failure showing in the crafting window, as I
understand it, gives you a progress boost at the cost of quality.
