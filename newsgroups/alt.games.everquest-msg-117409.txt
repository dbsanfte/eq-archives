    She doesn't "morph" - she respawns. The reason you can't see what
weapons she has (you used to) is because a guild would aggro her, she what
she was holding, and if she was/wasn't holding what they wanted they'd let
her de-aggro, pop back into the tree, and try again until she had at least
some of the loot they wanted. I wish the damned Itraer Vius had this
"feature" - we want anything but the weapons he has.
