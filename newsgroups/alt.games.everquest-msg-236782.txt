It has been known to happen from time to time. I think its a
mathematical artifact. Where function that rounds what mobs are light
blue (and experience giving) is rounding up, and the function that
determines the odds of getting a skill up is rounding down... and so
at some levels with some greens there is a minute chance of getting a
skillup.

That's my theory anyways. :)
