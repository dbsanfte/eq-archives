Someone else: come and join our group.
Me: sure, where are you?
<long pause>
SE: 1014.58, 572.40, 27.13
Me: Could you repeat the decimals on the z-axis please? I didn't really get
them.
SE: what?
Me: nm, sorry I have to go help a guildmate, I can't join you.


This "Someone else" is, btw, probably the same person who leads a five
person group hunting low blue cons at full spawn rate speed, but wants a
sixth member for the "group bonus" exp.

And the good side is, that it becomes more and more rare with really
clueless people as your levels improve... at least a little...


Excuse my english,
