Thanks for the reply Richard,

But as I've stated before I've played EQ for almost a year, and consider 
that year "lost" since all I did for 8 hours a day, next to working, 
sleeping, and living with my gf, and am not looking forward to doing that 
again ;-).

I've been playing UO for a short while, and even hosted a server at home, 
and a pretty large public server in the USA which I GM'ed at as well, and 
despite the nice things to do and meet people I still find EQ more 
"attractive" which might have to do with Morrowind which I love to death.

What I'm secretly looking for is something like Morrowind but then On-
Line, and from my experience EQ might have grown into that everchanging 
world. But as I stated before I WILL play sometimes for only 15 minutes 
or something, other times I'll play for 1 to two hours. I only think I'l 
be able to go for the full run (which used to last 4-9! hours in my time) 
on a few rainy weekend days.....

So just to rephrase my sentence about time management..... How much time 
in one go would I need to get the mos out of my gaming time with EQ ?? an 
hour, two hours ??

For Morrowind I know I can make a quick trip from one end to another in 
15 minutes, and I might do something similar with EQ (Is zoning still as 
bad ??) but I;d like to know if its still possible....

I got a free weekend (two days) coming up on 8/9 February and am toying 
with the idea of coming online again (sigh) (still not knowing if this 
will kill my real life again, or if its such a good idea... :-P )

Sorry if I sound like an ex junk or ex drug addict, but this game really 
haunts me :-(

Thanks ;),

Khalistro
