i took my 55th wiz on 5 ldon adventures this weekend (won all
5...woot!) and i usually just use tears of solusek or an occasional
ice comet. i never saw the need to use any pbaoe so i wondered if
anyone has tried aoe groups there. what would the optimal group be? if
a wiz has epic i would say 3 wizards, 2 chanters and a cleric. without
epic i would add the biggest tank you can get. ive done aoe groups
both with my chanter and wizard and they are a lot of fun. We usually
either did sebilis or CoM. I got a tell asking to join an aoe group in
velks and i wondered how well that would work with all the ice and
stuff.....seems like pulling that many mobs would be impossible in
velks. any other good locations for AoE groups if ldon doesnt work for
some reason?
