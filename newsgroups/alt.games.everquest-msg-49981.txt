Flash of Light is one of those "newbie" spells that never loses its
effectiveness.

Like "root" for a Wizard (level  4) or "snare" for a druid (level 5).
A paly/sk/ranger can always taunt to an exceptional degree, since
some of their spells _really_ increase aggro in addition to their
Taunt skill AND consistant melee damage.

Keep FoL, Stun, and Root memmed...good advice for all
levels of paladins after you get the spells.

PS: Wonder how Beastmasters will hold aggro? Imagine
a high-level beastmaster doing damage a bit less than
a monk and ALSO casting a slow or a debuff on the mob
beforehand...
