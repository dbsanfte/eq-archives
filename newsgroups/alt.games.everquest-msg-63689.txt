Players, obviously. Almost nothing sells to vendors for that kind of price.

There aren't that many +10 INT hand-held items, especially not at the level
you can get your hands on a stein. I see quite a few high-level players
walking around holding Steins (I have one myself). And 250-400pp is not a
lot of money, with careful money management you could afford that in your
30s easily, probably earlier. They also make good twink gear :).

However, they are pretty commonly available (any L12+ enchanter can do they
quest if they can be bothered), so don't expect to make masses of money
selling them.
