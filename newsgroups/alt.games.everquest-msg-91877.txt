Nope, monk/shaman is much better I think. In the absence of
crowd control or numbers a bad pull is a really bad thing. So
a monks ability to FD is almost mandatory. Also since a shaman
never gets CH a warriors hit points don't provide the same
efficiency.

Then again, we're playing the combination for dungeon delving.
If you're just grinding then it doesn't matter :)
