I would check again for Adware/Spyware on your system - it is definitely not
a "feature" of Windows or of MSN Messenger - the only thing Messenger pops
up is new IMs and any Hotmail messages you receive.  But if you are sure
that Messenger isn't running then it's not Messenger.

These things are sneaky - I had one spyware app pass through all of my
detectors and only found it because it was monitoring my IM conversations
looking for keywords like 'job' and 'love' and would then pop-up ads for
job-hunting and dating sites.

Good luck,
Rob
