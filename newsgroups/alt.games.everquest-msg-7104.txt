Just for the record, while I'm sure that James is correct about tons of stuff
being in patches that don't get listed in the patch message, as of last night
they had not removed the shark meat from the vendor in Vellious.
   That got me to wondering if they were really going to remove the meat, and if
so, why?  Is that considered an abuse of some sort?  For those who haven't
researched it, apparently this guy asks you for four shark meats, which you have
to combine in a container he gives you, and then return to him. The payoff seems
to be some small coin, a weapon that could be anything from rusty to bronze, and
some xp points. But what's the difference if you got the shark meat from a
vendor or from killing sharks? People buy things from vendors to complete quests
all the time. Guess I don't understand why this would be seen as some sort of
violation.
