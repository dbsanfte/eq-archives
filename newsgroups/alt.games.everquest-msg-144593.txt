We never do the sw-corner thing anymore.  I don't think we've done it since
that long-ago zone revamp.

We break at zone.  Seems to work a lot better than I remember the sw-corner
breaks going, too.  No more invising everyone for the run, no more invis
dropping, no more trains to the corner.  You don't even have to invis for
the port up, but it's recommended.
