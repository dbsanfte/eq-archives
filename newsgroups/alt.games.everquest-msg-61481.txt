should have gotten an AMD, but thats my opinion =P
That system should keep you up to date for a few months... this is starting
to suck, theyre going too fast with all the new CPU's, but AMD does seem to
be doing a better job than Intel...
oh, what OS are you gonna use?

My specs are...
Gigabyte 72x-h mobo (blech!)
AMD 1.4Ghz CPU, 266fsb (running at around 1.2Ghz, I dont need the extra
speed)
ATI Radeon VE (32 Mb DDR, dual display, I got it cause that comes in handy
when I work on gfx and html)
384Mb DIMM 133hz

I run EQ fine, full clip plane in Kunark gets choppy sometimes, but I barely
notice it... I just bumped it from 1134Mhz to around 1176ish just in case,
about an hour ago, I'm getting ready for SoL

BTW - what type of RAM are you getting?
With a P4 1.7Ghz, I would get fast ram, maybe Rambus... ill dig up a link on
it
http://computers.cnet.com/hardware/0-1103-8-6220389-5.html?tag=st.co.1103-8-
6220389-4.nav.1103-8-6220389-5
for rambus,
http://computers.cnet.com/hardware/0-1103-8-6220389-1.html?tag=prmo
for all types of RAM in general

if you do stick with the rambus though, not sure if it says it there on the
site or not, but make sure it wont get overheated, I remember reading
somewhere that they have a heat sink, but theyre close together. Good luck
on your system
