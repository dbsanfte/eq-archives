  Yeah, ok, you are.  But everyone else is saying that the word "pussy"
as "coward" is connected the to the word "pussy" as "Vagina or Vulva". 
Just because you keep saying, over and over and over again that it isn't
so, doesn't mean that it isn't so.

  I find it amusing that you think that you have any authority to
dictate to me what I should be reading.

  In your mind, yes.   And I have no doubt that your mind is quite
sealed in this matter.  But again, repeatedly saying something that
isn't true doesn't magically make it true.

   I have five cats.  I know they're freaking cowards.   I think they
are born knowing that they are a convenient meal sized package.  It's
really quite sensible for them to be very wary.  But what does that have
to do with anything?  To the majority of English speaking people,
"pussy" as "coward" is derived from "pussy" as "woman parts".   Again,
just because you keep repeating yourself doesn't mean that your opinion 
suddenly has more weight.

    Yes.  You are at least consistent in saying that.  Wrong, but
consistent.

  To what end?   You ignore cites.  You seem to think that repetition is
a valid logical argument.  You seem to have plenty of ROM memory, but no
RAM.

  Nope.  And I am not doing this to you, either.  You say that "pussy"
means "coward" (at least in the context that it was used).  Everyone
else says that that meaning is derived from the meaning of a woman's
genitals.  The connection between the 2 meaning is the heart of the
argument here.  And you keep trying to say that since you don't agree
with this view of the definitions, the connection between the three is
completely irrelevant.   So stick your fingers in you ears and sing "La
la la la la", all you want.  The context of the quote I and others have
posted is the very argument you are dogmatic on.

   If I say something you don't agree with, it doesn't mean I am a
liar.  It could simply mean that you are wrong.

  In your opinion, sure.  But since it seems to be your opinion that
everyone who thinks you are wrong is a liar, I don't give that much
weight.

  Sure, if you say so.

   Slipped up, you say?  Interesting.  I've seen postings from Lokari
for over 4 years, but I never cued into her man hating ways.  Of course,
I might have simply missed the signs.  Please quote her slip up that
revealed her true feeling on this matter.

   Are you under the impression that the Usenet is a Blizzard device? 
If so I don't see the connection.

  Let me give a little example.  I think that everyone in this thread,
yourself included from what you have said, agrees that "cunt" is an
offensive word to say to a person.  Let us also say that you and I play
WoW, and we meet in the game world.  We have a disagreement, it doesn't
matter over what.  I get mad at you, and say in a public channel, using
whatever leet speak I need to get past the filter, "Tcells, you're such
a stupid cunt".  

  Ok... now this is a different situation, and we are accepting that the
first situation never happened.  I take it upon myself to put in my sig,
right above the links for the AGE FAQ, the phrase "Tcells is a stupid
cunt".

   Three questions.  Can we agree that in both situations, I am being
deliberately offensive?

If so, can we agree that in the first situation, I am breaking the EULA
and deserve a ban if I get caught?

And if that is so, can we agree that in the second situation, though I
am still being crude and offensive, I am not breaking any rules at all?

Just curious.  From the way you post, I think I can guess how you will
answer the first two questions, but I have no idea about the third.
