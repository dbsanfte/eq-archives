No, that's hindering one RP action to encourage another.

Two, maybe. Ten, perhaps. 100+? No fucking way. Also note that the
characters are mostly seasoned adventurers with a trained eye. Yeah,
lots of items will look similar, but not EXACTLY the same.

True, but it's also roleplaying to stop and look someone over without
ever saying a word. Again, you're trying to hinder one RP action to
encourage another.

And this is utter bullshit.

You still haven't provided any strong argument of WHY it's not apt.
You've provided rather weak ones, yes, but nothing anywhere near
convincing.

Again, you're assuming that all the items don't have distinctive
appearances that simply cannot be represented by graphics limitations.
It doesn't take a close inspection to tell the difference between a
pair of Nikes and a pair of Reebox, does it?

If the items had distinctive "icons", sure.
