One thing to be aware of though is that it doesn't progress at the same 
rate as normal trade skills.

It has a formula, from memory, of (Your Level - 15) x 5 = Maximum Skill 
For Level

As you get 16 points when you first learn it. It means you cannot 
improve it .

It will progress as follows

Level 16 = (16) Max. Skill
Level 17 = (16) Max. Skill
Level 18 = (16) Max. Skill
Level 19 = 20
Level 20 = 25
Level 21 = 30
Level 22 = 35

And so on.

As you can see you cannot improve your skill level until you are 19 at 
least!

As for gear  you need the "Concordance of Research"

The Combine book for practice it is available by handing Greater 
Lightstones to either

Good Characters = Mrysila in North Karana.

Evil Characters= Smith T'sey (Spelt from memory) in South Ro.

Then make practice runes in it. Then combine them in your main spell 
book.

As a Necromancer you will need the Book of Dark Bindings to actually 
make real spells and combine the practice runes in. But I don't know 
where you get that sorry.

Anyway good luck
