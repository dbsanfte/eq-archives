Some software stores (particularly major chains) require payment upfront
before they will even carry a title. I can't remember the exact numbers but
for a $30 title something like $3-5 is to cover development costs and
$2-3 for materials; the rest is marketing, administration and sales
overhead. Plus a bit for profit. Sony aren't in this business for our
sake, after all.

You're right about the costs of the physical materials, but the physical
materials are not a large cost consideration, relatively speaking.
