   Yes, if you cannot tell the difference between a personal attack and a
disagreement with your ideas that probably is for the best.  Because I can
promise you that your "Here's an interesting idea, now don't you dare disagree
with it in anyway or I'll complain that you hate me and are being negative"
approach simply won't work.  This is not a big "Let's all agree with everything
Teckla says" party.  All the regulars here have had disagreements with others,
and usually without resorting to flaming or "stop or I'll hold my breath till I
turn blue!" tactics.

   I find it ironic that in other threads you have shown no hesitation to be
rude and combative with other people (maybe deservedly, I admit that I didn't
pay that much attention to flow of events), but the second anyone responses to
anything you say with anything other the warmest praise, you act as if that
person went into deep unflattering details about the sexual perversions of your
ancestors.

   Too bad, because as I have said, I think that some of your posts have shown a
you have a good potential to add favorably to the noise/info ratio around here.
