You will not evade me, jennaii@aol.comnojunk (Jennaii):

Pet peeve: rangers, who upon being asked multiple times if they'll do
snare duty while I'm actually doing something useful (like, primary or
secondary healer), either forget after two pulls, or never see they're
being asked. I've grouped with rangers who have snared the first
couple mobs and then gotten lazy, and then have asked me if I want
them to snare after I've had to snare 3 runners and asked them to do
it half a dozen times.
