No traffic? No.

Enough traffic to make it that big a deal? Maybe not. The Palm version 
of EQ didn't need its own group. Lords of Everquest didn't need its own 
group... maybe EQ1 doesn't need its own group *any more*. Or perhaps EQ2 
doesn't.

For all everyone's ranting and raving, there hasn't been much EQ1 
discussion here lately. We could probably move EQ1 traffic to .rpg and 
not create that much of a stink. (Although they'd probably suggest we 
come back here... everquest being more appropriate than rpg for posts 
about a game called everquest.)

"In the past."

Count the EQ1 specific threads in the last couple weeks. (And don't 
count the EQ1-EQ2 crossover threads like... hey is anyone coming back to 
eq1 from eq2 or can i take my items from eq1 to eq2) or non-game 
specific threads... "what is farming", "is IGE legal"

There's not much left, a bit on Rathe Giants, a bit of the M.Behemoth, a 
problem with a video card, server transfers suggestion, a survey on the 
worst class of mobs to fight 

You really mean to tell me you honestly think it needs a group to itself 
to cope with -that-?

Exact subject, yes. But I can see a considerable relevant differences in 
several details.

Why don't we take EQ1 traffic there?  or to .rpg for that matter?

My news carrier doesn't carry that one.

Because the existence of alt.fan.d-r.a.v.f.f.f.f doesn't justify making 
another one. An 'idiotic idea' and a 'kneejerk idea' don't add up to a 
'good idea'.
