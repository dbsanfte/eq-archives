My GHeal is in the 8th gem slot.   My heal macro is:

/sit off
/gsay Casting GHeal on %t
/cast 8

You can change that to pause for the cast and then sit if
you want.   I don't because I don't want to be locked into
a macro in case of a fizzle, the target being out of range,
or any other number of reasons why I'd want to change my
actions at that time.   (Like having an unannounced add
also pounding on the character where I'd want to hold a
little longer on the GHeal before casting it, for example.)
Something like that would be:

/sit off
/gsay Casting GHeal on %t
/pause 40, cast 8
/book

That stands the character, announces the heal cast, casts
the GHeal, pauses for it to finish, and then sits back down
with the spellbook open.   (Change the last line to "/sit on"
if you're level 35 or above, unless you like the spellbook.)
