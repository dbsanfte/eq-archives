Hail fellow adventurers,

Thank you for the kind words and advice. (Except for the response from
the ogre of course, but then it is an ogre and to be expected I
suppose. They do come in handy now and then when a bit of protection
is required and therefore need to be tolerated. I go so far as to even
let them think they are in control, keeps them happy. I am also very
good friends with Klurg and all of Oggok regards me fondly. So easy to
manipulate.)

Based on your advice I have formulated the strategies below to deal
with the situations I described.

> Q: When my reserves are waning, do I turn to a lesser haste and keep
> the slow or do I keep up the haste and skip a slow now and then?

For one or two fighters I will keep the haste spell known as Celerity
upon them at all times. I will only bother to slow enemies that
provide a challenge to the group or if our healer seems to be
struggling. If we have offensive casters among us I will reduce the
magic resistance of all enemies we encounter.

For more than two fighters I will keep the haste effect known as
Alacrity upon them at all times and follow the same strategy as above.

> Q: Is there a preferred communication strategy when I mesmerize a foe?

I have decided to indeed inform beforehand when I am about to
mesmerize a specific foe. I would keep encouraging the fighters to
assist our nominated main fighter.


I returned to the giant hunting grounds recently with the intention of
joining up with my newest friends and continuing the destruction of
the giants. I waited for a while but they did not appear. Giants were
closing on my position and I had to decide on a course of action. I
started to focus on my home, on the beautiful lake and surrounding
buildings. Strands of power floated around me, I could feel my
surroundings growing fainter.

With a sudden twist of my will I broke the spell I was weaving. I
firmly strode onto a small hill directly in the path of an approaching
giant. I took a jasper from my pocket and held it aloft while
chanting. The jasper dissolved and glimmering runes covered my entire
body. Before the runes had faded I was already focusing my will on the
giant in front of me. It noticed me and charged with an earsplitting
roar. It swung an enormous fist at me. I was only vaguely aware of the
attack, most of my concentration focused on dominating the giant's
mind. Before the blow landed it's mind was enveloped and it meekly
stood looking down at me.

I sent it at another giant and had them battle it out. I helped my
newest pet in destroying the other. It was badly wounded so I dropped
the enchantment on it and destroyed it as well. I was giddy with
power. I could feel my power growing battle after battle until I felt
a dramatic shift in my abilities. It was clear to me, I had reached
the 40th rank.

Perhaps the time has come to seek a new challenge.
