Again it depends.  For some reason people tend to forget things like
damage shields when making this kind of thread, of course damage
shields do not "count" as damage for the purposes of who gets the kill
but it sure makes the mob's health drop rather efficiently
nevertheless.  Call of Sky, Fire etc also add a few more DPS.

So, yes, if a Ranger and a Monk of the same level are standing
toe-to-toe completely unbuffed using melee only with the same ratio
weapons then the Monk would win due to various damage table factors,
Monk special attacks and the rest but pure melee isn't the entire
picture.

Purely *anecdotal* example: 60 large guild Monk and I are pulling
stuff in Velks, we both pull a Blizzard Spider at exactly the same
time and drag it nearer to zone to kill.  I get lucky with my pull
shot and crit for (330) or so but the distance the Bow gives allows me
to get a Calefaction in while the spider arrives (450), turn around,
run up a ramp and get another arrow in (75).  Spider arrives and I
start whacking at it with my personal damage shields up (29 per hit),
once Calefaction refreshes (about halfway through the fight) I toss
another one in for (450) and melee it to death.  I sit down and
realise the  Monk is still working on his.  Only takes him around 7 or
8 more seconds to kill it but I'm sure he has better gear, definitely
has more AA points (due to his title) and better haste (I only have
Epic haste) but for THAT fight I did more damage.  Doesn't prove
anything but to say that Monks > Rangers well...
