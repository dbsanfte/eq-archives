    Even in a CH chain, it's more than just button pushing. If someone lags
and heals late, you need smart healers to cover with fast heals if able and
to, more importantly, re-count the delay from the lagged person to the next
person. Otherwise you get CH's bunched up, and the resulting gaps kill the
MT.

    Get a cleric that isn't bound in the hinterlands to res you to the body.
And change that bind point. ;-)

    Tell the BST to get off his butt and go get Mass Group Buff. They can
MGB Paragon, which means they don't have to be in group to give you that
extra boost of mana. (They don't need to be in group anyways, because you
can /tgb Paragon, but that's for another day.)

    We killed Avatar of Earth yesterday (one more god for Time, wheeee!) I
was an offtank cleric. I hate horses, but honestly without one I would have
been screwed. And using good ol' Mr. Glue on a recent Xegony kill made mana
management trivial. I wouldn't use it for other, more mundane outdoor mobs,
but for the stuff where mana is an issue it's great.

> Xegony gets pulled the right way

    Our pullers always manage to pull Xegony on top of the clerics and get
us all AoE'd. The last kill we had on her I actually started dictating to
the push crew exactly when and how to push her ("clockwise",
"counter-clockwise"). Otherwise she'd slowly rotate around the MT until she
was nailing us with the AoE again.

    I've made that joke in raid chat before. "Main Tanks on Xegony the Scary
Faerie: JimBigTank, JoeBigTank, Delores, Monual, CH_cleric03,
CH_cleric04...."

    They've made a change in the pathing behaviour up there, too. If you
don't catch the adds fast, they path straight to Xegony and the heal team.
Our last kill we had two elementals mezzed right underneath Xegony, where
they'd been heading for the main tank.

    Whoops.

    I'm surprised at that. Those guards are mean enough that usually people
begin dying in bunches.

    I predict within two days of trying, given good turnout, you'll get her.
Just get people to show up, maybe get that BST out killing stuff instead of
babysitting clerics, and you'll be fine. What is the range on Zevfeer's Bite
(the SK mana spell)? Can he be somewhere else adding DPS and still
mini-twitching you?

    Ruh-roh! At least you'll get to visit PoM a lot during the clearing. =/

    Call it. You now no longer have the clerics to even make a chain for
Fennin. Clear the rest of the counsellors, in case they have drops, then
x-loc out rather than waste everyone's time.

> but we end up wiping with Fennin Ro at 9%.

    Ouch. Still, a very valiant attempt.
