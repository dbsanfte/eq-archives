On a PvP server, one of the first things you'll learn is that you need
pretty high MR to survive, especially if you are a melee type.  If blindness
doesn't get ya, snare and/or root will.  You should also carry with you
pumice to remove debuffs and effects they do manage to land.  Additionally,
it's a good idea to carry something that'll let you snare your oppenent so
they can't just run off and nuke.  Crystal webs from CC are a 2-shot snare
and work well for this.

If you had had decent MR, a melee type would have resisted that blindness
spell and you would have kicked the cleric's butt.  Their best nukes are 
against undead, not PCs.

Shoot for at least 100 MR if you can afford it.
