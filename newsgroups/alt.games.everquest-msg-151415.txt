I get the same thing sometimes under Win 2K.  I checked my page file (I had
to boot to win98 to see it properly), ran Norton Speed Disk and found that
it was *very* badly fragmented.  I defragged it under win 98 and EQ seems to
be better behaved back in Win2K.  If you are running Win 2K and don't have
access to Norton utils, then delete your page file (well set it to the
minimum 2 megs), reboot, defrag your machine with the standard defragger,
set your page file back to normal, reboot again and hopefully your system
should be more performant.

If you are running Win 98 then set your swap file to zero, reboot, defrag,
set it back and reboot again.
I don't have any experience (no pun intended!) with XP.

This is a good link to swap file tweaking...(will wrap):
