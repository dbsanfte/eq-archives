That soda can over there? The chair just sitting there!? The water? The dirt
i'm stepping on? What are you talking about!? Of course it created me, and
now we are creating ourselves and it. Or... it is creating us (as in, we are
dwelling within its time and space) as it is creating itself, ourselves?
Itself?

Ahh! So what "makes god" and what "doesn't make god" is the same thing?
Gotcha

Hmm.. I always wondered if God were beyond dimensional (multidimasionally
dimensional) beings creating a story for us.
As in.. our dense reality is dependant on their etheric, highly evolved way
of being. Which... is the same as our dense reality.. but in their
viewpoint.. that (our) dense reality is one whole being evolving and
creating itself with its help.

Hmm... is Everquest real? Hold your horses! Of course its a character here
and there... money being traded for a uber sword... but is the mind behind
every character... every transaction... does it qualify as a world in its
own? Is Everquest live in the sense that our minds actually live in it and
make it real!?Hard to imagine the kiddo that plays everquest, and in his
mind doesn't take notice of the monitor or mouse... but the interactions his
character goes through and the things he learns by interacting with those
other funny characters with a mind of their own behind them.

Hmm.. hope you guys understood me.. I know most of you did.
