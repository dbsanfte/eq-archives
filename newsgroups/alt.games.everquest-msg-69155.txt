Keep in mind that there's got to be a calculus behind this. People are
joining and leaving EverQuest every day. People leave for UO, AC, AO,
DAoC. People leave because they burn out or because there's nothing
new to do. And, yes, people leave because updates make the game
unplayable for them.

The question that has to be asked is, "Over time, will more people
leave because of problems with the update or because of a lack of
updates?" None of us here know the answer for sure, but I suspect that
stagnation would be a much worse enemy of EverQuest than what we're
seeing now.
