I don't remember the name of the bow, just that the first thought I had was
"I gotta get my ranger out here" when I saw the range and that it was
no-drop.

Arrow was simply "a flight arrow" I believe (perhaps without the "a").

What gets me is that you contest what I say by using *dropped* items that
are matched by *crafted* items (200 range bows are beyond common these days,
watch the auction channel a bit).  And when was the last time you knew
of a crafted item being the *best*?
