I far prefer shopping by looking for the one item per line. I find it way
easier to scroll up and read one liners. The paragraphs of 8 items listed I
don't even read, just scan for abbreviation of items.

Generally the item most important stats and price can fit in one line.
I do it all the time.

Usually to stop the tells. If you wanted to unload gear fast. IE: WTS FBSS
1K. It would sell fast and tells would be coming in for hours..


The spamming problem isn't the method the auctions are listed. One line per
item or one huge paragraph listing a bazillion items doesn't matter.

The problem is how often the items are repeated.
Generally for selling. I find auctioning wait 30 seconds repeat auction then
wait 15minutes to do it again works well. More often its spam and you get
ignored. If you don't repeat the items in quick succession they may get
missed. YMMV.
