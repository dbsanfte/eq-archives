You failed logic and analytical thinking I guess.  His post was obviously
not to be taken literally, and should not have been answered with an attack.
The attack itself is even a bit lacking.  Verant does not have a flat server
charge, then distribute costs in a direct ratio to the consumer.  If it did,
your monthly fee would fluctuate every month with the number of subscribers.
The fee was set at approximately $10.00 per month, as that allowed a certain
margin of profit.

By your thinking, if the subscriber base were to increase from 400,000 to
500,000, then we would see a 25% decline in the cost of the service, from
$10.00 to $7.50.  Or from $13.00 to about $9.75, depending on which rate you
want to calculate from.  This has not happened and will not happen.  It's
not economics and it's not even math.  People like to have a stable price on
the things they buy from one month to the next, when possible.

Before anyone misinterprets what I have written here, I have no complaints
about the small rate hike for EQ.  This is merely an answer to Dstep's ill
humored response to the OP's statements.
