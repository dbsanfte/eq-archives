I have been in the same situation. I have a life and want to stay in my 
small friendly guild. Most peeps are in this situation. Many have found 
raiding channels can give more game options to people like us. Find a 
decent raid channel on your server and join it.

I am not that keen on raiding myself and I have been on some very well 
organised and succesfull ones. Nontheless it seems like less fun and 
more grind to eventually get some more stats. That all seems to miss the 
point of playing a game.
