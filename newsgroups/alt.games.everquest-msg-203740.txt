Several things to keep in mind.  Be polite about it, there will usually 
be someone who is willing to help.  Shadowknights also can locate 
corpses.  In addition, in various places throughout Norrath and beyond, 
you can purchase a bone chipped rod, it has 3 charges of locate corpse.  
Target yourself, right click on the rod, and you will be facing your 
corpse, all you have to do then is run that direction until you find it.  
They are not expensive to purchase, and I highly recommend keeping one in 
your bank for just such occasions.  Try to get semi close to where you 
think your corpse is first.
