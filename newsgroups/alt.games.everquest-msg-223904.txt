I've never had a problem with that with my BL - I just go find a group
pulling blue or yellow-to-me mobs and ask if they mind if I work my skills.

Only once did I not get a positive response (they simply said nothing)

It might help that I lead off with a Spiritual Radiance before I ask :)

Unfortunately this still leaves my defense skill which is about 7 levels
behind now.  When I get to 60 I'm going to take my buddy's cleric with
my BL to the Gray - shissar hit fast - to fix that.
