Oh of course but he discussed no pros and cons, he compared EQ to games that
have yet to be released and we saw the same crap with the upcoming release
of DAoC and, as good a game as it was, it hardly killed off EQ.
Personally I hope EQ2 is something special because I find EQ long in tooth
now.

He posted to get an inflamed reaction...sorry I didn't actually provide him
with one, other than suggesting he shut up and may be brain dead, if that's
his idea of a flame he has not been in this group as long as he makes out.
He offered no arguement to explain why, this group is for discussion,
whether that is about game play, mechanics or failures in coding or Verant's
staff and help with the same, he has provided none, he has asked no
questions just offered a poorly thought out opinion that something he has
likely only seen screen shots of is going to be great.
Should all the people that play Q3 and RTCW now quit because Doom 3 is due
for release?

Troll is not l33t or d00d speak, it never has been, it's a usenet term for
someone who has come in to stir up a reaction.

So...I ask of you, where were his stated pros and cons? Please point them
out because I missed them in reading his drivel.
