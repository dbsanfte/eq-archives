What?  Rangers can tank pre-PoP exp grind mobs OK, not great mind you
but well enough.  At PoP level they can't tank but are doing sick
amounts of damage with Archery.  

They solo as well as a Shadowknight and better than a Paladin.  They
can heal well enough.  They have some sweet ATK buffs.  They got the
most diverse spell line up of any hybrid class, with the exception of
maybe Beastlords.  Hell, the fact that they have harmony and SoW makes
them, probably, better pullers outdoors than monks.

Yeah.  I can see why you think rangers are gimps.

Yeah.  Right.  Whatever.  I'll remember that next time my level 60
druid is getting outdamaged by a level 55 guildie wizard by a fair
margin.

Do you actually *PLAY* EQ?
