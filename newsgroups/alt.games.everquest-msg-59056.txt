He didn't start the comparison, just carried it to its logically absurd
conclusion.

When I am in a street fight I bite, kick in the balls, eye gouge, spit,
throw dirt in the eyes, anything to win. When I am having fun and playing
a game or sparring with someone I play by the rules and so do they.

The point is there are some people who not only don't play by the rules
but actively try to get around any rules that are there. Its one thing to have
a face to face battle or confrontation but another to get ganked by cheap
tactics simply because your opponent 'can' get away with it.
