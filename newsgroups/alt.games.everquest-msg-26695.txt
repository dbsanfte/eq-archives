> -The Skorpiki Gorge in OT,

Ahh, was wondering when someone would mention that one. First time i heard
of it was while pulling in OT, was out pulling when it started raining, so
my troll could not see anything. Ran what i thought was the right way, got
around 2000 loc in the wrong way. Then got the loc to pull to, started
running there, and suddently the world fell up.
