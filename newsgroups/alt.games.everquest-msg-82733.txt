Not in my book. But the new head GM we got is a complete (censored). He made
people with total fantasy names out of no book change their name (I even
wonder about the checks of names at character generation as well...
Aptocetapotl was rejected, however Hectlithlalec was all ok .. goddarn
random BS). We also had a guy wit a name, that he created WAY before luclin
was here. Now he is a Master through AA and his name produces something
you can read as masturbate. It wasn't HIS idea and with a title after master
it will not matter anymore, yet he had to change it. I recently found out one
of the new soulbinders has my name. I was there first, but I'm only waiting
for that fuckup to show up and tell me *I* have to change my name.

Meanwhile, a whole horde of 'Ifuckya Badass' and 'Usucks Alotz' runs around
freely in their idiot rampage. God, I hate those GM's....

(Yes yes, some ARE helpful, I know)
