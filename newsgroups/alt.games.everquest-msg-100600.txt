Hmmn - I did not think the name of the class would matter one iota. Let's
face it, they could rename the Necromancer class name to "Sisters of Mercy"
but that would not change a single tactic used by necro's if the abilities
weren't altered as well.

Magicians are masters of summoning things - whether that be a sword, a
bandage or an elemental. My mind isn't fusing out over the concept ~ are you
sure your taking all your medications?

Let's face it - if it makes sense to my meagre intellect we are not talking
rocket science.....
