I don't say NBG is selfish, I say it Benefits the selfish.

"Which may be none" you say.  Fair enough, but if you never go anywhere 
where nothing drops you can use, this won't happen as much to you.  If 
you were selfish, you'd benefit from NBG here.

And if the people you are with won't roll on items that aren't an 
upgrade to them, then your odds go up of winnning.  Benefit to the 
selfish again.

People who dislike NBG aren't the selfish ones, as GBN means you only 
have a one in 6 chance on each drop; if you want better odds you go NBG 
where you will probably only be rolling against one person, if at all

Plenty of people who -aren't- selfish also espouse NBG, after all, it 
seems like the least selfish plan in the game... and it is, for those 
who aren't manipulating it, conciously or subconciously.

Splendid
