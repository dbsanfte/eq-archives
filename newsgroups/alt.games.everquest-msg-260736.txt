From what I've read, there is no LDoN style loot with the task system.  The
quests I've read about are "go to X location" (locations are somewhat
cryptic, so this is a bit more difficult than it sounds until people post
spoilers) or "kill X mobs".  The rewards for the medium tasks in the 60's
are in the neighborhood of 100pp and a bit of xp (nothing huge) and, of
course, any loot or xp you get while doing the task.

The caveat is this is just what I've read from a handful of posts by those
in beta.  It isn't a comprehensive review by any means.
