It's simple. they will combine the two. Say you are fighting a duel. A guide
pops up and says to you "I'll give you a +1 sword for $10 ...i mean, you ARE
losing this, you know", and desperate to avoid humiliation, you pay, and
start to win. Then he turns to your opponent and says "I'll give you a +2
sword for $20 ..."

Hehehe!
