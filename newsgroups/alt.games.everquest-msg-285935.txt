Well, it's hard to parse patrick's diatribe, but I think he's full
of it?  I just went to check my subscription page.  I went to the
"change subscription" page, and was shown:

EverQuest Subscription
[various prices starting at $14.99 per month, $41.97 for 3 months, etc.]

Station Access Subscription
Effective April 2, 2007, the monthly subscription rate will be $29.99 USD
(plus tax and value-added taxes, as applicable.)
[checkbox to subscribe at current price of $24.99]

So, in short, the current subscription page on Sony's site shows
$24.99 for Station Access, clearly marked as rising to $29.99 in
April, and the prices for just EQ are still $14.99/mo (or less if
you buy a longer block), with no mention of a price increase to
$21.99 or anything else.
