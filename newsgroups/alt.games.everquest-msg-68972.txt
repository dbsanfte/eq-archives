Consider the implications of that.  Two possibilities:

1. EQ does not really *need* any of the DX 8.1 features.  In this
case, they've screwed their Win95 customers for no good reason.

2. EQ *does* need DX 8.1 features.  This means that the changes they
did to the EQ client between the CD going gold and release included
significant changes to the client, rather than just bug fixes, which
means that what we have in our hands now did not go through an
adequate in-house and/or beta test.  That could explain all the bugs.
