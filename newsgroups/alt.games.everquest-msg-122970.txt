These con blue to my Iksar Warrior at 51, but are major undercons. I
went with a group of guildies, puller was a level 60 Ranger, healer
was 58 Cleric, and another Warrior at 54. Ranger used some kind of
harmony pull, but even with that we still had to evac twice because
those "XI" (spelling) things joined in. They drop the Centi Meat and
also Centi items like Centi Short Sword, War Hammer, War Spear, etc.
If you go I would suggest a very high level group, and definately have
an evacer with you.
