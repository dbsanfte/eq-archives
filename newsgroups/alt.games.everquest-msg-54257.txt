No, your complaint is you're a fucking neurotic asshole that thinks no
one deserves to know anything about them and likes to get in people's
faces whenever they look at you because you get a thrill out of having
something to bitch about. You keeping everything you possibly can a
secret gives you some kind of power. Get over it. Having your
equipment inspected does NOTHING to harm you. It doesn't slow you
down. It doesn't have any effect on your gameplay.

Why do I need a good reason to glance at the name brand on the watch
you're wearing as you pass by? No, I don't NEED to know it...but you
have no rational, sane reason to keep it a secret.

Why ISN'T it my business?

It's a game. Someone takes an extra second to glance at what you're
wearing. Why is THAT any of your business?
