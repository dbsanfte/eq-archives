Well, to many of us, that is, in and as of itself, worthwhile.  I did a 
lot of things in EQ for no other reason than personal satisfaction of 
having done it.  I went out to Western Wastes and soloed Yeldema just to 
see if I could, I soloed General V'Deer(sp?) in OT just to see if I 
could.The xp and loot rewards for those enounters was worthless compared 
to what I could have gotten spending that same time xping in a group 
somewhere.  I have gone exploring various zones just to see what is out 
there.  Sure, I also spent time grinding to get levels and AAs, but, I 
would have been bored to tears if that was all I did.
