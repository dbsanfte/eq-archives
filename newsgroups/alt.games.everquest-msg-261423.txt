I think in this case they're just using the restrictions of the NDA to 
enforce something that will help them better manage their community. When 
people start posting on the public EQ2 forums "OMFG I GOT 
IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", this starts an inevitable chain reaction of posts 
from the envious who did not get in, and a predictable batch of PMs and 
posts to the forum moderators asking why THEY didn't get in since they've 
been supporting the community since before Jesus lived, and so on.
