That is part of the complaint about the nerf.  They didn't fix the
fact that we can get stupidly overpowered pets.  We can still get the
same pets that we always could.

I don't think that anyone (even enchanters) disputes that some sort of
fix was required in this area - the risk was too low when compared to
the reward.  The risk was still high but the reward in some zones was
well worth the risk.  The problem is that they reduced the reward by
too much and have actually increased the risk.

The reward was reduced by reducing the DPS of the charmed pet.  The
new pet does about half (or so Brenlo says - I think that the feeling
is that it has been reduced by more than that).

The risk was increased by not giving us an upgraded PBAE mez.  Our
current spell, Word of Morell, can only mez mobs up to level 64 so it
cannot be used to save us on charm breaks for mobs that we charm in
OoW with the new charm spell.  The risk has not been reduced by the
lower DPS cap because it goes right up to full DPS on the break.

Another problem is that the new charm spell cannot be used outside of
OoW zones.  Rather than going back to mobs in other zones and deciding
which should be immune to charm (or even having the forsight to do it
when the zones were designed instead of being lazy and letting the
level cap do the work) they have disabled the charm in all zones. 
This is probably to prevent someone going mad and charming a named and
wiping whole zones out.  This is a necessary aim but poorly
implemented.

In summary:
- the new charm is useless outside of OoW
- any charm is now too little reward for too much risk in OoW
