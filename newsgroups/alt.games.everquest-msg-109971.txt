Save up your pp and invest in a Centi Warhammer and Centi Long Sword.  The
taunt issue is due to your weapons being too slow.  Need faster weapons so
you hit more often.  I have read where some say damage output is more
important for taunting than number of hits.  I disagree.  From my own
personal experience I have found that using two fast weapons is better at
getting taunts on monsters than a slower yet more damage dealing weapon.
Also using faster weapons have proven to increase the number of times I
parry and riposte.  I simply get hit less often when using faster 1hs/1hb
weapons.
