Sure, those are real puller classes, I let a warrior pull, what makes 
you think I'd flinch at someone with the vastly superior tools these two 
have?

But it wasn't an issue of "letting" them pull, they had no interest in 
the practice.  And its my contention that someone who wants to pull, who 
has fun pulling, who's pulled a lot in their carreer, is usually a 
better puller in practice than someone reluctantly forced into something 
they've never done, even if their class is much better suited for it.

As it should be, in my opinion, he's wearing plate and should be a 
better sponge than someone wearing chain.

This wasn't my experience, though, I found that despite plate armor, 
with comperable HP and AC numbers my cleric always took more of a 
beating from a given mob than a ranger.  Perhaps they changed things, 
but bards and clerics never seemed to be on the same table as warriors, 
SK, and Paladins.
