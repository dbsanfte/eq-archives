Last night, I had my first run in with the reason inspections are
considered impolite/the worst druid twink *I* ever saw:

Someone inspected me and asked if he could buy my runed mithril
bracer. This someone is a level 4 druid, wearing chitin BP and legs
(inept twinkers seem to love that stuff.. BCP might almost be
comparable to my foreman's, but the leggings are nothing compared to
gatorscale. I guess the twinkers think it makes them look uber) and GE
boots. I ask him why he thinks I am wearing the bracer, something
which confuses him. I explain that I am obviously using it myself, and
yes that means I don't want to trade it. So, he laughs at me and calls
me a dumbass, claiming he'd have an awesome offer for my bracer. 100
pp and a rusty weapon? I ask. No, he has *much better gear than me*
and asks me to inspect.

This level 4 in chitin armor is wearing jasper rings rather than jade,
runed circlet with less wis than my crown of leaves, and has a *stein
of Moggok* in his off hand. When I saw the stein, I laughed too hard
to even check what uberweapon he had :) I proceeded to lecture him on
the shortcomings of jasper at low levels, how chitin sucked etc. The
killer was when he asked me if I was a cleric (huh?) after calling me
a bitch and then tried asking for my bracer *again*. I logged in my
lightly twinked alt and had a nice discussion with some guildies and
another twink sitting there about how to twink properly, still poking
fun at the twerp looking for a spirit tome (for his *off hand*, mind
you) and RMB.

I don't know, maybe the twit thought my charisma gear was my only
set... but he probably wouldn't have had the brains to whine for my
CGS even if he *had* seen it.

Come to think of it... I should have offered to give him my bracer for
his boots :)
