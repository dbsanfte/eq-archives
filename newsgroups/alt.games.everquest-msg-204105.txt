    Of course. The epics themselves are no longer epic, with a few
exceptions. These quests deserve to be called the "Kunark Class Weapon
Quests", and not "Epic Quests".

    I did it two years ago or so. We had 24 people. The mob managed to CH
itself once, and ran almost halfway down that side passage before we finally
dropped it. Times sure change.

    Way back when, I soloed the Lake Rathe one at 55 and took one person
with me to kill the Sol A one. Today, with the new-style cleric hammers, a
cleric  of epic level should be able to clear to and solo both without
issues. They were never meant to be tough. Ibiblat was a tough fight, the
King was a tough raid, and Ragefire was the serious timesink.
