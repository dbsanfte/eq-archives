> darkness...send pet...fear...dot

I see this alot.  Why don't you

darkness... send pet...DoT.. fear...DoT :)

The only reason not to DoT before fear is if it causes the MoB to aggro you
such that you cannot get the fear off.  At L23, my heat blood cast is not
enough to get the mob to aggro me (though they are aggro after the fear and
2nd DoT).  If the 1st DoT (not counting darkness) DOES consistently cause
aggro, then just run backwards as soon as it lands until you're ready for
fear.   They won't catch you with darkness on 'em....
