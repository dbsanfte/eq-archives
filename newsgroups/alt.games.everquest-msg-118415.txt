I played RTCW before I started playing EQ. I am of the opinion that the 
new EQ character models look much better than the RTCW models. This 
means if the EQ2 models looked merely *as good* as RTCW, Verant would in 
fact be going backwards, since that would mean they look *worse* than 
the current EQ models.
