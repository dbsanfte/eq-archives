Hmm, havent checked out any of the new quests there yet.  Have you looked on
eqtraders.com yet?  They are trying to get some of the new quests together
now.  Seems like Allakhazam is always a little bit behind Eqtraders when it
comes to quests involving tradeskills.  You can also try Lokari's site too.
He runs a tailoring site.
Have you tried making silk strings from spiderling silks first and turning
them in? They might be what they consider woven spider silks.  If that
doesn't work,  2 strings combined make a silk bandage, try that next.  After
that, 3 strings combined make a cord.  If cord don't work, I'm out of ideas.

Good luck
