 From an AI standpoint: Hmmm he just sat down.. means if I hit him he 
won't be able to dodge, or effectively roll with it. Also, it means he 
is likely a spellcaster, since he's not in here swinging. Booyah!

 From a player standpoint: Some of my most exciting moments have been at 
the ragged edge of no mana. How long can I med-mez to get the cleric 
enough to kill this thing.

I'm very sorry. This sucks ass imo. True it's just my opinion, but every 
time I've seen this I thought it sucked ass.

Final Fantasy, my current addiction, has this. While it has its good 
points, it also has its 'this sucks' moments. Especially when our group 
gets leapfrogged on our way to some boss mob that's not a instanced 
encounter. (Most are, however).
