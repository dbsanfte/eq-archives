I have done the leggings and wristband so far.  Definitely worth it, my
druid is certainly using these two items for now.  The wristband is ac3,
dex2, wis2, and weighs 2.0.  The leggings are ac5, wis2, agi3, and weigh
3.5.  Both are magic and no drop, human and half elf druid only.  I am
working on the tunic and boots now.
