There was GM run dungeon crawl on The Nameless sunday evening which 
involved helping one Sir FyreHeart rescue his lady love from an evil 
gnome in the depths (and I do mean the depths!) of The Hole. It started 
out as the typical GM event clusterf#$#k, everybody and his brother in 
zone, lots of deaths, lag you could cut with a knife (on my system 
anyway, hubby's is much better and he was fine); but as they got deeper 
the mob greatly decreased in size. /grin Of course, being held in a high 
level dungeon kept anyone much under 50 away, which probably helped cut 
down on the sheer cluelessness factor quite a bit as well. The GM 
playing Sir Fyreheart rezzed many of his followers as they went, so it 
was fairly painless for the participants, once the initial horde had 
been thinned down. I ended up having to gate past a locked door whilst 
dragging a corpse up for rez and couldn't get back down; but my husband 
made it to the end with his ranger and a couple of people got GM goodies 
for assisting in the rescue.
