I once heard an angry Necro say that quadding was an exploit in Cobalt
Scar... and he most likely had his own interests in mind. Since then, I've
heard a couple of other people bring up quadding as an 'exploit' so I
figured I would only offer my understanding of their gripe - just to be
fair.

Heh, once again, I'm distancing myself from that opinion.
