Thanks for all the helpful advise. I really don't travel that much (yet) and
didn't want to offend anyone when I advertised that I would be willing to
donate for port or SOW. I try to help people when I can (which at lvl 11 is
not as much as I would like), but I see people constantly walking up to
druids and the like and just saying "can I have a SOW" no please or thank
you. It seems rude sometimes, and I don't like to be rude (in game or out).
I also forgot to ask how much is considered a good donation for a bind?
Thanks again.
