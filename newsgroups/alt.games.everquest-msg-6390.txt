It is fun. They signed up for it so they have to take it. Its not like
Rallos was some safety-net carebear server and they changed it to full
pvp +item loot.

If people dont like it, they will have figured that out in the first 58

threaten my life because I pk'd them. Can you say "wrong server
selection"?
