I think I had problems pulling singles there at 65 when I went to help
a friend get her temperance spell, not positive though since it's been
a while. As you pointed out it's not a big deal if you get an add,
it's different for a mage though since their crowd control is
nonexistant. 

On the subject of crowd control, dunno if you have VP3 yet but I
highly recommend that one. Dunno how I lived without it for that long!
