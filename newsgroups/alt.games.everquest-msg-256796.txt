This is one of the reasons I have given up EQ. They had a dozen or so
zones from the beginning of the game that were over 75% unused. (can
you say the chasm between HHK and E Karana?) Instead of adding
more content to the zones that needed them, they added new zones
that required more money in expansions... Here are a few ideas I had
come up with to make EQ more fun WITHOUT expansions.

Chasm from HHK to E Karana - Giant ants - 2 factions (red & black)
    that are in a war. Fight one and you gain faction with the other. This
    gives possible quests for the queen ants.

Lesser Faydark - Loved the Halloween zone they did the first or second
    year! Bring back the undead to Lesser Faydark. Bring back the
    corrupted unicorn! Undead pixies rocked!

Clan Crushbone - that castle just BEGS for a basement zone! Make it a
    mid-level zone (20 - 30)  Use it to tie in the dark elves as the castle
    suggests.

Steamfont - can you say balloon to (well, the most likely place now is
    Stonebrunt) or to Qeynos to allow travel "around the world"

West Commons needed to have a zone at least to the north to fill in the
    origional map. Maybe a zone that is half Lavastorm and half HHK.

The Karana's - boy, where do I begin? These have to be the most spread
    out, boring zones in the game. The run from Qeynos to HHK is one long,
    sleep-inducing, autorunning stretch I remember.... I remember setting my
    invisible enchanter on autorun straight across West Karana and falling
    asleep in my chair to wake up and find him drowning at the river just
south
    of the North Karana Bridge!  Some of the DM events (undead again) at
    least made life interesting for a while.

This is just a small sample of how they could have fixed the game without
adding any expansions..... Instead they spent their time growing their world
so we would spend more money. Some of the origional quests STILL aren't
fixed after almost 6 years!
