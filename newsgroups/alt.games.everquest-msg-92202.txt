If you're in FM, you just need to hop one zone over to The Overthere.
Just head in, turn right once you get to the end of the hallway, and
set up by the edge of the zone.  Snarks, sabertooths, and cacti are
just tripping over themselves to get smacked down there.

Another option, if you have Velious, it to head over to Iceclad and
start on cougars, snow dervishes, and even giants if you want.  Good
hunting there, and it can be a little less crowded that OT.  Another
plus is that you can even try quad kiting the cougars.
