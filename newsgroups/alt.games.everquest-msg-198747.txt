If you get into a good group, which isn't easy admittedly, there is NO
downtime...  no matter what class you are playing.   You'll be either
sitting on your butt watching the fight, occassionally standing to do
something important, or actually in the midst of it.  If it's not
managed well, there will be down time due to deaths from overpulls, or
downtime to med/heal from overpulling, but it won't seem so bad,
because you'll have company...  people to joke with, discuss the game,
life, the meaning of donuts, etc.

Downtime while you're by yourself does blow, unless you have a good
book to read.
