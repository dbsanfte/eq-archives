My Iksar monk shares the same problem. As you face the ogre village you'll see
rocks to your right, keeping them on your left, run around the rock until you
can see the ogre port and wait for the boat to arrive. When the "Bloated Belly"
leaves the dock it passes close to where you are. You can get on it by either
swimming or levitating. 

There's a map of Timorous Deep at http://eqatlas.com/atlas.html
