Thanks for your suggestion from a few days ago as to what to hunt in
PoD.  You are right, the flies are easy and the xp rate is so much
better.  I'm now seeing the rate that you were reporting...about a
yellow an hour at 52.

Speaking of PoD, I was grouped with a 55 Shaman and a 54 Beastlord. 
We decided to try and take Grimor Plaguebringer who apparently is a
Level 60 quest mob.  That was the first time I've been a part of
taking a level 60 mob.  I know he is a Warrior class but he was very
easy.  Granted, he punched me for 432 but the Shaman malaised him and
all my DoT's were landing.  I was surprised because I thought that
there are level limits to what spells/songs could land on a mob.  What
I mean is, I didn't think any of my songs would land because he was so
much higher level than my character.  He didn't drop anything, which
didn't surprise me.
