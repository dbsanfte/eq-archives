When I ran my Iksar monk through there, the necro I grouped with (same
race and religion) did the intial turnins in skelly form, he wasn't
KOS then. I'd assume the same thing can be done now with a Dark Elf
potion. If not, your best bet is probably to pull the captain outside,
and have a friend that isn't KOS hail him while you do a sneak
turn-in.
