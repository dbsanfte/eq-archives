It's been over two years since EQ was released.  The base
configuration hasn't changed much in that time.

Given the shelf-life of computers these days, expecting 256MB of RAM
for decent performance in a game that's going to have as much polygon
count as the SoL screenshots indicate, is completely reasonable.

RAM prices are stupidly cheap.  It's the single easiest and cheapest
improvement you can do for your machine.  256MB of PC133 RAM costs a
whopping $20 (pricewatch says $18).  Most people spend that much on
coffee in a single week!

The place where people are going to see the major hit on the
pocketbook isn't the RAM requirement, nor the CPU (since AMD is making
CPUs priced to be damn near disposable).  It's the video card.

I suspect while SoL will work "well" with a GeForce2 series, it won't
be something most folks are going to "upgrade to".  Most will no doubt
take the big plunge and go straight to GeForce3 or better.  And the
cheapest GeForce3 card available is the Ti200 which retails for about
$180 to $200.

And 400,000 EQ players?  Not a chance.

Ok, see yas.

In case you've missed it, the single biggest factor to drive most
consumer hardware sales is because people wanted to "play a game".

CPU, Video, sound, memory, even to some degree harddrives have been
driven by games.
