Problem with most escrow services is that they give the customer a grace
period to try out the product. Great idea for a tangible item. Not so
great for digital media which can be easily copied.  Sorta defeats the
purpose of providing protection for the artist as well....might as well
just say "pay when you get it", y'know?

Wouldn't it just be nice if everyone were honest?  Yes it would.
