This is most definately NOT a flame or "are you an idiot?"
answer, just a question.

Your are aware that you CAN turn off the inspection
message, right?  That's the only game-play effect somebody
inspecting you has, that annoying "soandso is checking
out your gear" message.

Now after an inspection, when the dude(tte) starts
spamming you to sell something you're wearing to them,
that's just rudeness.  No way to program out boorish
behavior.

Just turn off the inspection message.
