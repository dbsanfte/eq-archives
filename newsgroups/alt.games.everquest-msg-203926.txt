a group? ok its possible in a highish end guild., but then that wouln't be
the majority, more like the minority.

Most enchanters that sell KEI are ones that are in guilds where getting the
spell to drop regulary is low, if at all .(atleast on my server). The ones
generally in the higher guilds dont need this source of income.

Anyone that spends <real> money to sit on their arse doin tradeskills, need
a serious reality check.
