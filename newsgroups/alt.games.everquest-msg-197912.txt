The far right number refers to the amount of data being received.  You 
don't need to worry about what measurement is used, just knowing what it 
normally looks like  allows you to tell when you are receiving much more 
than usual.  For older, slower PCs/video cards extra data to be 
processed and drawn will often result in frame rate loss or other 
symptoms.  If my screen starts stuttering my first move is to check that 
and if the number reads 2000 when it normally reads 200 I know that is 
the reason as opposed to memory leak or other issue which may be a sign 
of eminent crashing/time to log out fast.
