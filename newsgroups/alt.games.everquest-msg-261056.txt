Hmm... I checked Lucy, and I was pretty sure I saw a targeted AE in the
wizard 66 - 70 spells.    Mabye it didn't go live or something?

Seems to me that they don't really need to "kill" quad kiting this way, as
the Kod Taz solution worked just fine.  Making 10 - 20% of the mobs randomly
able to summon, with no way to distinguish before engaging if they would or
not.  (As you could before, since summoning was by mob type).

A death or instant evac use once every 5 - 10 kills seemed to take the wind
out of most kiters. (1)

(1)  I'll note for accuracy sake that I'm not KT flagged yet... just going
by what I've heard coming out of there, and what I've seen from formerly
solo classes / players suddenly looking for KT groups.
