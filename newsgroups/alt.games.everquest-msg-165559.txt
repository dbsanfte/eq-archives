While these suggestions have some merit... having an online journal would
often be nice. Notes get lost, or "cleaned up". Quest journals are a UI
issue. Improvements to the UI are a uniformly good thing.

I for one have reams of hand-written notes from various RPGs I've played.
But quest journals are *so* much nicer.

... I do wonder if you've been playing the same game as the rest of
us when you suggest this.

You *do* realise how often the bracketed phrases have nothing to do with
what you actually have to say, don't you?

eg. NPC says "I need you to [get my boots]"
you reply "I will get your boots"... nothing.
"I will get my boots" ... nothing.
"I will get yor boots" ... success!

The phrase list in the game is broken in lots of places. Typos by the
designers sometimes, or just sheer bloody-minded variations. I don't
mind typing these short phrases, but guessing games are not good
role-playing, not good video-gaming, not good gaming period. If they
can't get the parser right, they need to offer a way around it.

Fixing the parser and/or phrase lists would be almost as good as
clickable text. However, neither is likely - too much work for
the programmers & designers.

While it's often tempting, you'll frequently find it worthwhile to
assume that those you are conversing with online are *not* congenital
idiots. Please at least consider *why* somebody might have made a
suggestion before stomping on them. There are lots of people in
this group more than willing to stomp back, and the last thing we
need is another name-calling thread.
