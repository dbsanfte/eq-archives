}This thread has been interesting to me (and prompts me to play a female char
}for kicks...) but I think it is interesting that all the talk has been about
}the Male players treating female toons in a stereotypical way.
}When I started my main in Halas, I interacted with male and female toons and
}didnt' notice any overt difference in the interactions with myself and them
}or betwixt each other...
}however... after a friend ported me to FP and I visited the EC tunnel
}(pre-bazaar) I was taken aback at the number of female toons who would
}constantly reference me as 'Hun'...  "Sure, Hun",  "Thanks, Hun"... etc...
}now, if I was a hormone-charged, straight, 16/17 year old kid, I'd be
}flippin' in my blue-jeans and reading all sorts of implications into the
}fact that she was calling me 'Hun'.
}Further, as I played in the zones between EC and Oasis, I was constantly
}'/giggle' -d at, '/hug' -ged, '/kiss' -ed by female toons.  (I'm thinkin -
}"geez!  These 'chicks' must not be used to seeing a manly-man barbarian...")
}OTH, the guy-toons aren't so freely affectionate with one another on The
}Rathe server...  (imagine the slash-fiction ;~)  Dorn and the Orc-Raider...
}The three barbarian fishers...  heh heh)
}I suggest that some of the gender-roles that exist on EQ are not exclusively
}a case of the male gendered players exerting social stereotypes...

Heheh... I have no hard data, but it's been my impression that the female 
toons who are flirty right off the bat like that are in the majority 
played by men.  The female toons played by women seem frequently but not 
always to be much shyer.
