Do they run faster than JBoots?  Do they snare or root?  I wouldn't expect they'd summon.
Don't you have to do like 5% damage to a mob before it will summon?

The Undead Captains, and those evil floating beasties (whatever they're called) con red to
me.  Once I trained them to Al'Kabor, I'd have to use stuns and nukes to damage them.
Things could get hairy if I somehow pulled aggro while getting in close to generate melee
damage.

Will Lanys or Al'Kabor leave their posts?  The Gate Keeper and the Key Master - we've GOT
to get these two together :->

Best regards,
