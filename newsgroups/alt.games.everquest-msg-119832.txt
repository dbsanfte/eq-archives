I used to be in the Army once upon a time.  One thing it taught me was to
abhor group punishment.  That is, to say, "Members of your group said or did
suchandsuch.  You will ALL therefore be punished."  That shit teaches the
innocent nothing, and the guilty tend to be punished less than they
otherwise might be.  There are some damning quotes from that raid, to be
sure, but not everybody on the raid was part of those conversations.

Any of them who had missed the 'sploit chatter, but who were summoned to
Arena, must have been pretty surprised.  Especially, as I mentioned before,
because a GM sat there saying nothing until it became apparent they would
win.  If he had done his fucking job and warned them the moment he noticed
what they were doing, and they persisted, then I'd have no sympathy for them
at all.  Unfortunately, he did not warn them, and they were made to pay a
heavier toll for it.

Anyway, what's done is done.  Many arguments were made for and against at
the time.  You apparently agreed with the decision; I did not.  It seems
clear neither of us is on course to change his opinion.
