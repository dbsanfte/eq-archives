Hah, I need to turn on names.  The writing style (and opinion) were the
same.  =)

Strangely enough, I don't generally use abbreviations for a lot of stuff
that the majority of people do.  I have no problems with them, but I type
fast enough that there is little benefit to using them and a without using
them they don't come naturally to me.  I do abbreviate zone names like PoK,
and some buffs like KEI.  I've even been asked why I type out peoples' full
names in chatting.
