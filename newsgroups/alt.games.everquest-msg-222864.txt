This one I don't really have that much of a problem with.   Yours if of
course the better solution, but between Naggy, Talendor, Ragefire and
Nortlav, red scales are common as dirt compared to green scales.    When we
were doing epics, we had every bard and warrior needing a red scale
completely done, about 5 in the bank, and were giving still more to other
guilds that needed it.   Green scales?  Well, I think we got a grand total
of three.

Too bad it's two years too late though.  They finally fixed the bottleneck
after demand had slowed down to the point where it was not really a problem
for most people.  At this point, I'm not sure it's worth suffering the Sky
raid to get the warrior epic.    The red blade is a great weapon, but...
well, mudflation.

Adding pickpocketing in its current form is the worst thing Sony ever did to
the Rogue class.
