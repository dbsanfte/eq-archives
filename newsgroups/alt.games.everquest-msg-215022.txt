Let's see - first group 5x65, 1x58, avg = 64 - mobs hit for 360, 15khp, 1/2
were 58+.  All the 65's got 51pts (max pts for a normal adventure).  We
got to the boss and killed him in about 60 minutes in each case
(3 in 4 hours including returning to the camp, sell and split etc)


second group 4x65, 2x58, avg = 63 - mobs hit for 270, 10khp, all were less
than 58.  All the 65's got 34 points.  It was a hostage rescue, we avoided
half the mobs.

The difference in reward matched the difference in difficulty - this is 
exactly as it should be.  BUT - the difference in difficulty did not match
the difference in average levels.  It becomes apparent that it is NOT 
average level that determines difficulty.  Since one low level "ringer"
does not change difficulty from a full group of 65's, but 2 does, it is
also not simply based on lowest or highest member.  Since I requested all
the adventures, it is not the level of the group-leader that determines
difficulty.

Excuse me? 2x +6 int augments?  Look at my magelo and tell me how I can
boost my int by 12 with the cash earned in about 10 hours in Seb.  I put
those augments on my Ring of the Hateseeker, and my Solstice earring -
2 items I likely won't upgrade anytime soon.  Remember of course that in
those same adventures we've seen many items drop - some got greed rolled
and sell for great cash, some got NBG'd.  Droppable loot included a
14/21 axe with Veangence 2 on it, Nice Druid pants and a couple of others
that I'm not remembering because they weren't int caster stuffs and I
excused myself from the rolls.  We picked up several +int, +wis, +sta,
+resist and +mana augments in these trips.  Also, when you make
a recommendation remember that I can't put anything in my ring/bracer/ear
slots that have summoned focus in them until I get those focus in other
areas.  Ornate boots are on my list (replace ring) and I'm saving my
Mistmoore points for a primary IDIV item that is 1460 points (replace
wrist).

So, I get points toward something that is equivalent to an incense burner
of ro (150k on my server when it drops), +int, +xp, +pp and a totally 
different experience to camping in the same old dungeon that I've camped
a million times before.
