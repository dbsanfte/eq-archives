Wood Elf Druid.  Guessing here on Wisdom but probably somewhere around 175 -
185, as Ive easily put on 60pts of widsom in Gear upgrades since then, and
wisdom is now 244. Didnt use KEI or any other "Crack",  because frankly I
didnt even know it exsisted at that level. Only buffs I ever had were self
cast.  Method for killing usually consisted of snaring, dotting, then kitng
them around hitting them with my most efficient nuke. Once the did the whole
"Death march" thing, Id finish them off with close combat, or at least try
to. When I grouped with another Druid friend we would ping-pong mobs via
aggro kiting.
