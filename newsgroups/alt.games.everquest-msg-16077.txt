Of the two original brothers in that stable, Shakrn and Ulan, one of them is a
merchant while the other is simply a quest NPC. I've never yet killed a
merchant in EQ, but I'm told that if you do you get no xp, no loot, and the
merchant just poofs. This is possibly what happened here, depending which
centaur you ganked.

I have no experience with this creature, so I can't help you there, sorry.
