  Fair enough.  Pardon, if you can, that I am probably going a bit
overboard with the redundant attributions.

End quote.   

   Note: I do not claim to have written that many posts.  This count would
also reflect any posts that just happen to mention/reference/quote me as
well, I believe.

Sorting by date, the earliest post that references me that I could find was 

http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=90r776%24c31%241%40slb6.atl.mindspring.net

Dated Dec/12/00.  To be honest, I'm not sure why that one comes up as the
first, either.  I started playing a shaman as my first serious character,
and this post is where I'm asking about a monk alt I had started.  I don't
remember the topic of my very fist post to this newsgroup, but I do
remember that Bizbee bitched at me for my pompous tone (a flaw in my
writing style that I admit I have and try to tone down).  

   Of course, a.g.e was not the first newsgroup I ever visited.  But it
would be harder for you to find my posts in some of the other newsgroups I
used to frequent, and I think it would unreasonable to expect you take them
into consideration when you labeled me a usenet noob.

   So, either you falsely called me a noob, or you feel that 5+ years is
not enough time for usenet noobishness to wear off.  I suppose you might
make the argument that the fact that I disagree with you on this relatively
minor matter is what makes me a noob.  You might very well believe that
unless everyone who is on the usenet agrees with you on every point then
they are "noobs" regardless of how much time they've actually spent on
usenet, I suppose.  However, I think that most people would agree that the
term "Noob" might more reasonably be interpreted to mean "a newcomer".

   Oh, I would do that.  But I refuse to crawl in sty and start flinging
shit.  I know, heck, I bet we both know, that I am nowhere near as good at
flaming as you are.  You flame, I walk away from the original point.  You
might not like it, but that's how I play it.
