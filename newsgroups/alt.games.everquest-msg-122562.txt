Well... yeah?

Nothing quite as embarassing as being forced to say "Hey, can we hold up the
raid for 20 minutes now that we're finally here?  I forgot my fire resist gear
in the bank, only have poison resist on me.  Come on, I'm sure you all can
find something to keep yourselves amused while you duel me, rez me back and
then completely rebuff me...   and there's not *that much* of a chance that
Uberguild_01 will show up to kill the mob while we're fucking around with all
that."

Actually I personally get off somewhat light, since I'm usually either Main or
Secondary tank.  I wear HP / AC gear almost exclusively, and carry one minimal
set of general purpose resist gear.   I do however carry about 5 different
weapons, depending on how much aggro and damage I wish to put out.  One handed
proc weapons, one handed non-proc weapons, two handed proc, two handed
non-proc...

Where this scam was generally effective was back when Wurmslayer was a popular
weapon.   Since it won't fit into a bag, and needs an open main level
inventory slot.
