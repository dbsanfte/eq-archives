What Brad doesn't comment on and what is the real gist of the issue is
this, a TACTIC that has been used on Vox and Nag raids since the
beginning is now being called an exploit.

I&#8217;ve been there I&#8217;ve seen it, I&#8217;ve seen GM and
guides bless the safe area tactic on these raids.

While others not have a problem differentiating the two events, some
of us do.
I&#8217;m not a mind reader, how am I or anyone else supposed to know
in one encounter it&#8217;s okay

but in another it&#8217;s not?

Spell stacking?  Please, if a spell stacks with another spell people
will use it.  How is the effect any different?  X spell cancels Y
spell or prevents Y spell from working.  What is a tactical player to
do? Ask the GM first? Why? How am I supposed to *know* to ask?

As far as the snare issue is concerned, yes, warn or ban but this is
another situation where other guilds doing the exact same thing were
not warned or banned.

Consistency is all a player asks from a GM.  When will Verant do that?
 When will Verant stop banning and disbanding and suspending accounts
based on ASSUMPTIONS?
