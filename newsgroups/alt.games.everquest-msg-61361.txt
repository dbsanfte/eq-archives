I think the first step is to call your congressman and your lawyer. The
evil bastards at SONY have obviously stepped all over your
constitutional right to ignore the rules they set up for the terms of
use you agreed to before you signed on to their contract and sold their
property. SUE THE BASTARDS! You must know HUNDREDS of lawyers personally
who always beat fuckheads like these corporate whoremongers! Go get'em,
bubba!
