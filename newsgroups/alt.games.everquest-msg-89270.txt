Because people are goddamned lazy.  My ranger is currently in Iceclad
fear kiting cougars to get his 1HB up (Another digression, how do
people manage to keep ALL they're melee skills up every level?  I can
just get both my slashing skills up before I ding?  Or couldn't, just
got a Silver Swiftblade.  A 16/24 2HS seems to get the skill up pretty
quick.) and there was a guy there asking for a TP to Faymart.  Nobody
was on that was either in the mood, or capable of doing it though.
This didn't keep him from asking, in an increasingly bitchy manner,
for BETTER THAN AN HOUR!

My ranger got 35 and running from IC to GD, getting zapped up to the
Nexus and then back down to WK and running to Surfall Glade took LESS
than 45 minutes.

Feh.

>Especially High Pass, which was always a zoo to begin with.

High Pass is, or was back when my druid spent time there, a zoo.  But
I still always had a great time there.  This was back when even the
GM's considered the orc's a FFA area.  And for the most part,
everybody seemed to understand this and have a good time with it.

Granted, this was LONG before Kunark came out.  It's probably
different now.
