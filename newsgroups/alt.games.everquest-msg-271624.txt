I disagree.   Whatever AMD lacks in throughput, it makes up for with lower
latencies.

People don't buy the highest end processors.  The underdog will ALWAYS be
able to compete by lowering their prices.

Intel has had to give up - cancelling the 4 Ghz Prescott because it could
heat a house, and reverting to dual core design.  They did not want to do
this.  Now they are talking about using SOI, an AMD technology, to continue
making their chips.   If they do have something up their sleeve it must be
damn well hidden.

The Israeli team keeps making great Pentium M lines (Banias/Dothan . .
.what's the next one called?)  But Prescott is broken.   Motherboard
manufacturers are complaining that heat dissipation is causing increased
warrenty work, and more expensive motherboards using special heat resistant
parts don't bade well with the big OEMs.  Dell got a new CEO and almost
overnight Dell is talking about including Opteron chips in their server
lines.

AMD outsells intel in the US and some places in South America, and the trend
is spreading.

AMD will conquor all.   MUHAHAHAHAHAHA
