Before the infamous Monk nerf, a Lizard Shaman / Lizard Monk was the best
duo in the game.  Now I would say a Shaman / Warrior duo.  Preferably the
same race.  As a retired Bar Warrior I had the best of times when a friend
of mine who played a Bar Shaman and I grouped.  Shamans complement a Warrior
better than a Druid or Cleric in all situations except when a Rez is needed.

Since POP came out I think they need to make sure every Druid guild has a
decent supply of "Will Port For Food" signs.
