good advice but the lavasoft link don't work.......

try www.majorgeeks.com  that's where I stumbled on ad-aware.  Highly 
recommend everyone get ad-aware and run just once.  If you don't get at 
least 20 hits from that program, even if you have the best antivirus in 
the world, I'll be very surprised.  I had 73! advertising type files on 
my computer the first time I ran it and some of those were running 
processes of some kind.  God only knows what kind of personal 
information was being sent out on me before I found ad-aware.
