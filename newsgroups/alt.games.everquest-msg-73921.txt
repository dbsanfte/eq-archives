As a frequent user and sometime contributor to the EQ Traders site and
its message boards, my experience has led me to believe that it is a
labor of love through and through.  The web hosting was donated by the
provider, as has been noted.  Until three weeks ago when the Paypal
button was added, the only link for donations was on the message
boards and went entirely to EZ Boards to keep the boards ad-free. 
I've been using the site for well over a year and it was thriving when
I arrived.  So, Niami (the webmistress) and her husband/assistant
Ngreth created and maintained it for at least a year and a half,
possibly much longer, completely out of pocket.  She does not do this
for a living like most of the other quality EQ sites do.  The Paypal
option was only added after frequent requests were made by users on
the message boards, and was greeted with much rejoicing that we could
now give back to the webmistress who has provided such a marvelous
resource.

To me that suggests that she needed an upgrade to run Luclin
effectively, same as the rest of us.

Because she took a portion of the Paypal donations for her own
personal use and wanted to let us know what she did with it.  She is
holding herself accountable to those who gave her the money, just as
you are saying she should.  We keep telling her to go get a massage
and a pedicure to help with the site-induced stress, but she hasn't
yet been willing to use it for anything not in some way related to the
site.

If you've only ever used the site for the tradeskill info and haven't
followed the site news or read much of the message boards I can see
how it would make you a little wary.  But I assure you that after
watching the way Niami quickly updates the site and responds to user
concerns and questions on the message boards, she is putting a lot of
herself into it.  Not only the time but the effort of updating the
site and moderating the boards to keep them family-friendly and free
of flames.  It is one thing to sit down and rap out some html, but
quite another to consistantly pay attention and respond to the
concerns and requests of the community, particularly a community as
demanding and diverse as EQ players.  For a while she took a long and
frustrated hiatus from the game altogether, but the site updates
faithfully continued.

No, I am absolutely certain that the donation button appeared
primarily because the hosting provider indicated that the free service
may not be able to continue, and that money would not have been taken
out for personal use if it were not for the insistance of the
community that she be willing to do so.
