I just got my wristguard tonight.  For those that don't know about this item,
it can be obtained from a fairly simple quest in Velious.  
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  

AC: +10 Str: +5 Wis: +6 Magic Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +5  
Weight: 5.0 
Classes: All Classes  
Races: All Races  
Inventory Slot: Wrist
Effect: Extended Affliction III

Does anyone have any info on the effect?  Does it extend a fixed amount on all
dots or does it depend on the dot?  How many clicks or what percentage does it
extend dots.  Also, if I equip the bracer, cast the dot, then switch back to my
normal bracer while the dot is in effect, will I still gain the effect of
extended affliction III?
