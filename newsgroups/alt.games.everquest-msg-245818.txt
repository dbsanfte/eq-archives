THe group leader gets an LDON adventure from an NPC in the camp. Each camp
has entrances somewhere nearby (the butcherblock ones are in Lfay for
instance), THe everfrost ones are in the same zone as the camp.

You go to the zone where the adventure entrance is - a blue line appears
on your compass to indicate where the entrance is (lfay has more than one
entry point possibility). Everyone runs to the entrance, you buff to the
nines, then you enter the dungeon and you cross a zone line to do so and
you are in a specific instanced zone for the party only.

Its a zone in so you lose wolfform, also you probably lose it before then
as you get to the dungeon entrance as not all entrances are in their
camp's zone. Use SoW or SoE.
