This would work just as well, as long as its consistently
followed and occaisionally mentioned so that those
not familiar with the concept get with the program.

On Morel Thule, its "train whichever way you like,
and get a res when you zone -in- without many hp
to hit headon the train from the -other- guy who
was headed out.  Oh, and by the way if you manage
to survive that headon, you can always leap back
out of the frying pan into the fire you pulled to
your last zone!"

I'm curious as to why left, since most of the driving
population of the world appears to stick to the
right hand side of the road, do you have an unusually
high brit/aussie population?  Pardon my ignorance
but are there any other countries in the world which
follow the "wheel on the right, drive on the left" model?
