It still does do what CHeal used to do. 7500hp is more than enough to
completely heal even the most uber of tanks currently.

Actually, they are making improvements based on what's already there.
CHeal, even after the change, won't be falling short of its original
functionality. Now, when PoP comes along and ups the level cap, then
there may be tanks going over 7500hp. But, considering CHeal has never
healed that much in the past, it's effectiveness towards that is
unchanged.

Really, don't you have better things to do than find excuses to piss
and moan about the "evil corperate thieves"?
