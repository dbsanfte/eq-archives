I have a mania for names that involve two words starting with the same
sound.  My troll warrior has the surname Knucklegnarl and my dwarven cleric
is named Hammerhead Knocknoggin (neither of them has reached 20th yet, but
my characters have full names from the moment they're born).

Names like Bristlebeard, Stonestance, Grizzlegrin, Granitegrip, Cragcrusher,
etc would work..
