This is the key to our discussion, Sang keeps saying "this is the way it is"
and I keep saying "not at low levels, I bet it improves later though"

Since it takes longer to get from 50 to 60 than it does to get from 1 to 50,
its understandable that people at high levels get to thinking that the things
they have discovered at high levels must have been true at low levels too,
and when they used other approaches they were simply uneducated.

I propose, though, that which tactics are most effective -actually- change
as you level up.

Grasping roots, as you see from my report, gets resisted a lot and sticks
for scant seconds most of the time when it sticks at all.  Course it doesn't
help either than I'm working on red to me mobs... but thats my most
effective exp per hour target at the moment.

Yep, I'm not doing it much any more either, even on my report you
can see I had to soften up the target with some DD first.  It does mean
that I can always finish off a red mob, even if partial damage on the
DDs means so many more nukes that I start to go OOM.  I just slap
on DS and suck up some damage till the target finally runs.

If you are soloing, like I am, downtime may be part of the point.  Part
of the reason I'm playing a druid is so I can do some AFK stuff between
kills; I tried a necro, but by level 20 I realized that there is no downtime
to playing a necro well!  Druid can make about the same exp per hour,
and do so spending literally half that time on his butt, hidden, so I can
happily do chores and so forth.

I sincerely wish I had the roots my cleric has.  No damage component.
Less resist, seem to last longer, in groups don't interfere with mez, don't
put me up high on the hate list... the damage component of druid roots is
so low that it strikes me as nothing but a drawback.  90DD nuke?  That
would barely kill one of my running "red to me" harriers at 21!  Of course
the one I have is a 10DD nuke, so its not even in the running, that root
test run I did I think I put in 60 or 90 damage total off roots.

I really look forward to quad kiting, as sick as it will make my friends;
again, I'm looking for high efficiency in terms of kills per hour, coupled
with large chunks of down time.  Quad kiting seems tailor made for me!

My experience with other classes is that the best exp is generally a well
functioning duo or threesome... not a full group.  The "group bonus" doesn't
ramp up fast enough to compensate for the lack of efficiency that gets
introduced in larger groups.

Pulling is an art... and not every player who's character gets assigned
to the pulling slot is an artist.
