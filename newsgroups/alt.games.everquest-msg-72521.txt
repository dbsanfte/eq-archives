i too am pretty cluless , so i went to http://www.crucial.com/ and let them
specify what i needed,  they delivered within a couple of days, i banged the
stuff in and "hey presto" no problems. if a hapless goon like me can do it -
anyone can.

And you dont have to buy from them i guess, but they will specify what can
put in your board and tell you what the speed of the chips will be.

I will leave it to someone more techy than me to tell you about the
motherboard speeds and simm's. dimms etc.

Good luck

Nee
