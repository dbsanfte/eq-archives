Nope, no enchanter.  Not on boss critters.  There's very little for
enchanters to do after they give the clerics clarity and the warriors speed.

Not much reason for a shaman either unless, like he said, there's some
chance of slowing it down.  Otherwise the shaman is useless.

Rogue & monk?  Sure.  Wizard?  Probably a waste of a group spot.  Don't see
much point in an SK, but I don't know much about them.
