I bet you are crashing on zoning?
Is the picture the correct picture on zoning?

I was always seeing the East Freeport dock when I was having major
problems zoning from OoT to East Freeport, but the docks are not what
you see when you first zone[1].


Can you do any network logging. I find that when my EQ crashes on
zoning, that the program has jumped services port number and the
response from the server gets lost and the program squarks and crashes.

would fall out of the sky {:-).
