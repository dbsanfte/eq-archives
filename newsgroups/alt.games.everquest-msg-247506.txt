This is a logical and expected upgrade on SOE's part, they want the
game to look better and it does ~ almost all video cards except very
old ones are compatible with dx9. Of course there will be bugs with an
upgrade as large as that one was

Agree with you there ~ and SOE does too. They recently did a major
patch which tuned GoD encounters more reasonably ~ and made corpse
recoveries easier from the hell it was earlier

Yep, there are still bugs they are working on.

They should have lenthened the time between expansions, agreed. My
guess the reason they rushed this one through is because alot of the
high end time capable guilds are nearly finished with GoD and SOE
doesnt want to lose them because of lack of new content


I think there are probably more but those are the very bad business

No business is perfect, but they are trying
