Personally, I have a die hard fear of water in EQ. I know, I know, that's
just plain stupid, except I have a die hard fear of it in RL too. I forced
myself to learn how to swim when I was in my 20's, just out of sheer terror
that I might someday drown. Last night I watched a friend drown and I got to
thinking about it. It was horrible. My swimming if feeble now. I guess I'm
gonna have to force myself to swim ingame. My question is -- where can I do
it more or less safely? Darklet is 18, a druid, and scared to death of the
water. Any ideas? I'd really rather not have to contend with pirahnas!

TIA

Darklet

Thanks for playing.
