No that's not how they do it.

They moved onto the next step in obliterating the constitution very
quickly. Now they can declare anyone to be an "enemy combatant" and they
are disappeared as the "war on terror" will not end any sooner than the
thirty year old "war on drugs". Why a "democracy" and the "shining light
of freedom" should always be fighting "wars" within and without is never
discussed.

The same liars on TV who continue to claim that Oswald acted alone, and
for more than six years have insisted that John Doe II never existed, now
they tell us that Jose Padilla may have been the phantom himself, even
though those who know about Tim McVeigh know that he would never have
anything to do with a Jose Padilla. 

The real John Doe II was a German national, Andreas Strassmeir. Andreas is
the son of Gunther Strassmeir, former Secretary of State under Helmut
Kohl. Andreas was working for the FBI as their plant at Elohim City in
Oklahoma. 

The FBI had a plant among the first World Trade Center bombers in 1993.
That plant helped stir the explosive mixture. This was reported in the Los
Angeles Times, but like so many golden nuggets of information such as
this, it was never again mentioned. 

I have no doubt that a "dirty bomb" will be exploded in this country in
the near future. The U.S. government will see to that. I also believe that
this country will then be assaulted with a biological attack within a year
later. This will result in soldiers in the streets as we saw at the
airports following 9/11, and a total lockdown dictatorship. All of this
will likely happen within two years. 

There is no need to worry about how the vote count will go down in Florida
or anywhere else in the future.
