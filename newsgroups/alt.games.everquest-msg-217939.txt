i've had 2 myself finish in the last minute, usually following a wipe at 
some point in the last 10-15.  one was a "kill the boss" type, where our 
guys couldn't agree on what path to take, and we were just slow (our 
first mission in LDoN for all of us save one).  the other one, our 3 
tanks died in a nasty fight where i (the cleric) was summoned and 
stunned twice and couldn't get off the heals...by the time we killed the 
bastard, we had myself, a mage, and a druid left, with 6 to kill in 15 
minutes.  slow going at best, we finished that one just barely.

ahh, memories.
