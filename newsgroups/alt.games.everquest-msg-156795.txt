I feel like an ebayer every time I play my bard.  He's around 28 now but
born in 5/99 (maybe 4/99) and I keep having to relearn him.  And my
mage...well, I'm getting good with him again (44, mod rods, YAY) but when I
first started playing him again (level 30)...god, I sucked.  My enchanter's
so used to getting aggro that I kept forgetting the mage is NOT supposed to
get it. <g>
