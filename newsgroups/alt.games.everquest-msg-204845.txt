Actually, a single group can do the Hole part of the Shaman epic without
problems.  We did it this weekend with 7, but from what I could tell, it
would have worked just as well without me.  Here was the lineup:

    62 Warrior
    65 Ranger
    ?? Monk
    ?? Shaman
    62 Cleric
    55 Enchanter
    56 Wizard (me)

We are a casual guild...not even up to NTOV yet, and no one had any uber
equipment.

The Monk and Shaman were mid-to-high 50's.  On the way to Kirn, we had one
death, when we got 4 mobs at once while going through the city, and the
Enchanter went down before getting the first mez off.  We managed to kill
them all anyway.  After Kirn, we decided to go all the way to the bottom,
and had one more tough fight while leaving the undead tower.  We got a bunch
of adds, and had 8 mobs to fight, but no one died.

We then went to take a look at the Scalekeeper for the Warrior epic.  He was
up, and, without knowing *anything* about him (hell, the Warrior had to go
check the net to see if we were supposed to kill him or talk to him :-)), we
tried him.  Man, that was funny.  In about 5 seconds, everyone but me and
the Cleric was dead.  Since I hadn't attacked, and the Cleric had not gotten
a single heal off, we were stiff indifferent to the Scalekeeper, so were
fine.

Turns out the Scalekeeper has a 1500 point lifetap.  I don't know if it is
supposed to be a random proc, but if it is, we got very unlucky.  It went
off on every swing.

Anyway, give it a try with one group.  You can probably do it.
