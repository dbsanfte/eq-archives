Boats are not meant to be 2002-era travel.

They also add an element of realism to the game.

Maybe when you board a boat you should be given a choice of
destinations...then you would automatically be taken off the boat when you
reach it.

AO has various types of transport that you can purchase, and your ability to
use them is a skill, and can anyone see a starwars universe without
speeders, x-wings and Banthas? Sailing/Boatmaking that were already
mentioned in this thread seem a good idea to me

Downtime is where you can chat, specially if you play a bard and cant do
jack when you are fighting, or even sometimes in group downtime.

Anyone can say how shitty things are, making worthwhile suggestions take
more time and thought. Try to be constructive if ya have a comment.
