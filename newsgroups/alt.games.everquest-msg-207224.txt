Odd you say this as almost everyone I know would swap those opinions
over.  *grin*

I've always had pleasant dealings with VF but some friction to the
populous in general could perhaps be down to the fact that they are
now clearly a bona fide raid guild and with all that entails you can
get unfortunate things happening (eg: taking over Ssra farming
components, huge trains in ME on the way to VT, steamrollering of xp
mobs/groups rushing towards a named etc in quite a few zones etc
etc.)
