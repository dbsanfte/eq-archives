First, please try not to top post here. This issue has been beaten to
death, but please try to adhere to it, it makes reading your post 10
times easier.

Second, you make a good point about /auction. Stick with it. No matter
what zone you are in, always use /auction. That way no one can really
complain about your "spam". If they don't want to see zone wide
messages about sellers and buyers, filter it out. That is the most
reasonable compromise I think. Make a hot button for it and hit it
once in each zone you travel through.

There are some people that feel /shout-ing for anything like selling
or buying is down right rude, and I tend to agree with them. OOC is
not the right channel either, because it is really in character.
Auction is where it belongs.
