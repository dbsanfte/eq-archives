After months of talking about it...our groups finally got together and
created our own guild.  We got together last night, and had a GM officially
create the guild, and I did the /guildinvite for all the members...no
problems...

Question is...what is the command to appoint officers?  No one seemed to
know, the /help guild didn't have it, and the GM wasn't even sure how to do
it.  We were told to /guildinvite USERNAME O, but that didn't work.

Anyone know the commands?

Thank You,
