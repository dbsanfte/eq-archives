Interesting concept, however the theory that you cite is simply an opinion
and value judgment.  In my case, I find that Ayn Rand fits my values far
better than Karl Marx.

I will suggest to you that speaking of the "market" in general is useless in
this type of problem.  The only thing that truely matters is the particular
transaction in question (and the nebulous "market" is the compilation of all
these transactions).  For the fletcher who works a schedule that restricts
her playing time to the middle of the night, a few pieces of acrylia may be
worth more than double what other fletchers would pay for it, simply for the
fact that it's available when she needs it.  The value of the acrylia to
that particular player is rather high, and the "market price" for that
transaction is whatever she's willing to pay for it, assuming she can find
someone to sell at that price.

That does not set a new price for all other transactions, ie... the 'going
price.'  It just means that for that buyer and seller, the price was right.
Why should the seller take less than the momentary value of the acrylia,
just because it would normally fetch a lower price?

As long as the delivery of the acrylia isn't a "vital service," I don't see
what's wrong with asking what you think you can get for something.  If the
buyers don't think it's worth that price, then you won't sell very many.
