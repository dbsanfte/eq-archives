Hmm, I just read the post and it sure looked like you said very
few players of rogues would appreciate it if the game told other
players when their characters were picking pockets, and for how
much. This implies that the RL players want their characters to
be able to rip off their groups, even though (assuming you are
on a blue server) there is no risk involved, other than spoiling
their reputations.  RL Pricks would be another way of describing
those people.

I do have to agree you didn't say 90% of all players feel that
way, you only implied that 90% of players of Rogues did.
