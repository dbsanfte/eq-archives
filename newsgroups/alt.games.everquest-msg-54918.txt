    Does he need to worry about that, though? I can see Leach conflicts -
you'd have to work out some sort of "alternating leaches" arrangement there.
But he has what, five or six DoT lines to choose from? Even at level 12,
have one necro cast darkness and poison and the other do heat blood and
leach. Four DoTs (which is usually overkill), no overlap.

    I can see benefits to each arrangement. With a druid, you never have DoT
conflicts, snare is a lot better than darkness, you have heals, HP buffs,
regen, damage shields for the pet, and SoW available. With a second necro
you have redundancy in case of overaggro / adds, you regain mana at the same
rate, you have twice the available melee damage, and you can even fully
utilize the incredible breadth of the necromancer spellbook (all six DoT
lines, mez, heals, resist debuffs). It's a tradeoff either way.
