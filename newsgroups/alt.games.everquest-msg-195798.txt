Well, not exactly.  As with all Kunark armor, half of it drops in Karnor's
Castle, the other half drops in Old Sebilis.

The only two pieces with good stats are the Legs and Breastplate.    They
drop off of Venril Sathair (real one, not Remains) and Trakanon,
respectively.   Both Kunark "raid" level mobs, the bosses of Karnor's Castle
and Old Sebilis, respectively.    (and yes, VS can now be done with a single
group or less if you're uber, but for Kunark level they are both raid mobs.
(As in, I can remember 30 person raids wiping on both, back in the day))

Karnor's pieces

Gloves - Drolvarg Captain (Named)  (worthless strength buff)
Boots - Skeleton captain (Named)  (good strength buff)
Legs - Venril Sathair (Raid)  (excellent stats, right click invisiblity)

Old Sebilis pieces

Arms - Zol Knight (common mob, ultra rare drop) (Lesser Shielding)
Bracers - any type of Mycanoid (Common mobs, ultra ultra rare drop)
(Shrink! Yay! rare and useful enough to still be worth a fortune)
Helm - Reet Knights (common mob, very rare drop)  (Infravision - good for
night blind types)
Breastplate - Trakanon (Raid)  (Excellent stats, right click 100 point heal
spell (14 sec cast time))
