Some people just make the mind boggle... anyway...

Do my usual bard lfg in the OT (cant remember exatly what level i was
then... 32?), and I get this 43 barbarian warrior in full crafted who wants
to make a group of 2 and fear/snare kite the sabretooth tigers and high con
rhinos. Not really what I had in mind of playing mana song to a full party,
but I tell him that I dont think my fear or snare will be much use against
reds. He says that we will try anyway since he can solo them, so he proceds
to pull a sabretooth tiger and get pummeled to about 1 bulb of health while
i get resist after resist.

So I get out my trusty mandolin and play healing song to this guy for a
couple of minutes. I tell him how my fears not doing anything and snare is
gtting resisted, yet suddenly find that this guys gone of to pull another on
about 3 bulbs of health. What to do?

So after getting fear resisted some more, I change to my trusty yak and ebon
blade and proceed to inflict the odd nick and cut to this thing while
playing healing and the odd below. Eventually when this guy gets to about 1
bulb o health, he decides to run. The tiger is in about the same condition.
So hes running to fm, and the tiger is chasing him taking hunks out of his
back, even with selos, and woo hoo... I finally get a snare to stick. Send
this guy a message that its snared figuring Id get a thanks... but no... now
this guy decides he wants to tak this thing out. So he turns around, and
starts fighting it again, about 1/2 way down the gorge. I fight alongside,
but cant save his sorry ass, and end up having to zone.

Next thing our group is disbanded without a word.
I quikly add him to the ignore list so I remember not to group with idiot in
future.
