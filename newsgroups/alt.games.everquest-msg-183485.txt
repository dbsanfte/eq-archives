The SK has no chance in hell of outdamaging the monk.  It wouldn't even be
close.

As for the best partner: well if you're mindset has SK's ahead in HP and AC
(monks being ahead in avoidance and ATK), a shaman would be a much better
partner for the monk.  Slow + Avoidance = perfect for a shamans small
healing capabilities

So I'd say monk, as answer to both questions
