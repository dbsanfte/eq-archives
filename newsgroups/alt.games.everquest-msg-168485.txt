How would you rate the different classes given all you know of them at this
point.

Thinking generally, how important raids are, experience groups, soloing,
getting money etc etc

Here is my list, now start _flaming_ :o)

� Shaman
Overpowered

� Enchanter
Overpowered

� Monk
Slightly Overpowered

� Rogue
Slightly Overpowered

� Necromancer
Slightly Overpowered, mostly because soloing is so easy an idiot can do it
and they still bring a lot to an exp group, snare, mez

� Cleric
Balanced

� Warrior
Balanced

� Bard
Balanced

� Magician
Balanced

� Druid
Balanced

� Wizard
Underpowered at earlier levels, but overall balanced

� Ranger
Balanced

� Shadow Knight
Balanced, maybe not at raids

� Paladin
Underpowered, I put shadowknight higher because SKs have snare/fd which is
very useful in exp groups
