For one and two yes exactly. Use force if you want, use ambush if you
can, tactics are a great invention. There is no recall though so if
they are there in force then you know where they are, call on your
realm to fight back. Cheaters are banned outright, first time no
exceptions, and that includes some of Mythics CS staff who were fired
this week for apparently trying to twink their characters using inside
info.  Take their forts one by one, bottle the enemy up in their own
home (ie safe no pvp) realm. Capture their relics to earn points to be
used in all sorts of stuff like housing and horses.
