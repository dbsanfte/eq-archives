Chances are at least 80 percent he was pulling it from my experience. The
higher level the zone you hunt in, the more likely they are pulling. About
the only zones id assume people were fleeing, would be newbie zones like
butcher, qeynos hills etc. Ive yet to see a group with a puller in either of
these zones.
