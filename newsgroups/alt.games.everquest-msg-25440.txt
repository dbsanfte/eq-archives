I am wondering if the new Luclin graphics engine update
and new character models will include updated item graphics?

For instance will the Skull of Jhen'Tra actually look like a skull
instead of a purple voodoo doll? Or other skull held items for
that matter.

Or will the Paw of Opolla actually look like a paw
instead of a purple voodoo doll?

Will the Leatherfoot Raiders Cap actually look like the cap
that the Leatherfoot Deputies wear? =)

Will Black Iron weapons actually look black?

Will there be new item icons? Many items look identical.

Will there be new spell icons?

Will there be new spell effects?
