As posted in another thread, the 23.11 drivers will "work" with my
system, but the performance is unplayable crap. Same with the 22.80
drivers that VI is pushing. Oddly enough, when I downloaded and
installed the 22.83, I was back to working optimally. The folks I
corresponded with who had good results with the 23.11 seemed to be the
ones with Win 2K or ME. Maybe that's a factor? Anyway, I have 98 SE and
the 22.83 drivers are working great.
