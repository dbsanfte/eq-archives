Why is it someone elses fault that you are lagging, or you have a mob on
you? More to the point, why are you trying to exp in oasis in peak hour
(just as an example)?

If you are a melee with a mob on you, and you arent running, then I
would say you should be with a cleric. If you are a solo'er, I suggest
you find a quiet place to exp.

I'll help you out here, from the perspective of a pk. If I want to kill
just any person, I head to areas where people who are within range of me
(lvl50-58) are frequently known to go. I hit up Oasis, sro, KC, nek etc
etc, anywhere I know people who are in range will be (note: doesnt have
to be an exp zone...high levels often hang near bank/town/portal/zone
areas. However, I don't go wandering to zones like skyfire trying to
find people to kill...why? Because no one is there! Its a perfectly good
place to exp, is close to banking/vendors (next zone in OT)...but no one
uses it as it is a very boring zone. *I* exp there because I'm not
exactly welcome in your average seb group and no one hassles me at all
(maybe the occasional passer-through will run from OT to BW zone or the
somesuch). Even in the relative safety of my zone, I *still* don't let
security rest. I exp in quiet spots that aren't near or inbetween both
zone-ins and portals. Its second nature to have dot slots and defensive
pvp spells up ALL the time (shadowstep, gate, harmshield, deflux).

You see, its 99% YOUR OWN fault that you are attacked so much. Pk's
aren't stupid, if they want to find someone to kill they just go to the
obvious places and they'll find people like you, without resist gear,
dot slots, pvp spells memmed....sitting plain out in the open with 2
bubs hp. Perhaps you should think about learning even the most basic
defensive tactics before blaming others.

> I think most of the people that play PvP servers are confused. 

Heh most people resemble you on PvP servers, perhaps even a little
stupider...as they not only blame everyone else for their own
shortcomings in PvP (verant, pk's,sony, gm's, server rules...even all
the nerds in the world get a bad name because of these people), but they
actually keep PLAYING on a pvp server.

So why is it that YOU get attacked a lot and die, and I don't? I don't
put myself in that situation....I learnt the hard way that if you try to
solo outside paw at level 30 in US peak hour YOU WILL GET GANKED. Think
about it...

I thought it was "cheap shot"? Oh but now they are exploiters!

Please, just learn what the FUCK you are doing in PvP. And I am serious,
I am a known pk and even now that I'm not guilded in a pk guild I still
get frequently attacked when I do the necessities (by the majority of
people too...remember non-pk's outnumber pk's by an extraordinarily
large margin) of banking, buying spells/items/etc. I *do* have a
character on RZ who isn't a pk, and the only way I can see that you are
attacked that much is if you have NO knowledge about PvP in EQ.
