Really?  I lost my job and with it my bank account and debit card.
So, unless some retard lets me use their card info, my account goes
kaput next month (I know the world is full of idiots, but I'm too nice
to take advantage of it) Do the AMEX giftcards work, and do they sell
them at all 7-11's?  I get cash all the time from odd jobs I do, buy
Verant won't take cash.

Thanks

P.S. I am NOT asking anyone to give me credit card access or account
access or anything like that.  All I want is info on the giftcards you
can get at 7-11, so please don't flame me.  :)
