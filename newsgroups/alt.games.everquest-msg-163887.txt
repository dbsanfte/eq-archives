We aren't the police.  Sony has protected themselves against having to deal
with this sort of thing (in spite of what some would say, that is the *main*
reason for the language in the EULA).

There are options for you, and they have nothing to do with EQ.  What you
did in buying the account is, at most, a civil matter.  What he did by
taking it back is criminal.  FBI, state/county attorney generals, those are
the people you need to contact.  Mail and wire fraud across state lines is a
felony.

Yeah, it's work.  Whether it's worth it or not is up to you.
