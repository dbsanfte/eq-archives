Depends on people's interpretation on exploiting, but I recall a similar
thing I tried a few years ago. In FV you could pull drolvargs to some of the
wandering NPCs in the forest area, fair chance the NPC would die a horrible,
but funny death.. the mob would come after you next as you pulled them in
the first place.. almost dead, and you finish them off..
Downside to this is getting Drolvargs adding to the NPC mosh, meaning you
now have two doggies to run away from, or you get a wandering NPC joining
in, killing the drolvarg and leaving you with the odd feeling you have been
shafted.
