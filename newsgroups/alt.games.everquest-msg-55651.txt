Thanks for your comment Al, but alas it doesn't solve my problem, every time
I enter the new billing information (either with my new credit card or the
VISA card from my Dad) on the ingame subscription form and send it to the EQ
billing server I get the window with a "sending billing info... please
wait... this might take some time" massage followed after 2 minutes by the
1016 error message (you have been disconnected , try again)

I don't think the quality of my connection is the troublemaker as I can log
into other online games just fine (and I'm getting these 1016 errors for
over 48 hours now)

The info found on the EQ Knowledge base isn't very helpful either :

EverQuest: Error 1014 : You are not currently subscribed! Either you have
not chosen a subscription plan or we could not bill to the account
provided.Do you want to subscribe NOW or LATER
You will receive this error upon logging into EverQuest if:

1) You have cancelled your account and the subscription period has run out.
In this case you would want to resubscribe by clicking on the NOW button
when the error box pops up. Once you have resubscribed you will be able to
log into the game without receiving the same error message again.

2) Your subscription period has ended, and we were unable to bill your
credit card for the next subscription period due to some sort of decline of
your credit card. At this point you will want to resubscribe as stated. If
it will not allow you to resubscribe then you may want to contact your bank
or credit card company to ensure there is nothing wrong with the card. If
you continue to have difficulties after that point then you will want to
contact our Technical Support Department for further assistance. You can
reach one of our representatives by phone Monday through Friday from 8:30am
to 5:30pm PST at 1-858-537-0898.

Reason 1 doesn't apply to me and for Reason 2 I contacted my bank card
company and they said they hadn't received any billing request from The
Station for the November period, I guess I'll have to phone late Monday
night here to get someone on the phone on the other side of the World to
help me out (hopefully)

If anyone else has a suggestion, feel free to reply here, thanks.

Venomia.
