Yep items under 250 are showing same trivials.

My point was assuming items over 250 are the same. After all since alchemy
was never broken one may as well assume much about the game.

As far as success rates go. I have seen several items mainly with idols and
steins having the same triv levels but much different success rates.
Unfortunately I am not about to make 1000 of each to even get a glimpse of
probably success rates.

Which is the crux of the problem. No one has ever made literally thousands
of velium and platinum items per gem to give any statistically significant
info. The rng is too flaky giving rise to obvious spurts. Try 5 velium
pieces. Fail them all. Try 5 platinum pieces. Succeed on them. Means
nothing.
Except for when you are trying to make some money selling the goods (.
What this means is that items over 250 are not easily verified.

As far as making money with JC it is like any other tradeskill takes Lots of
plat to get skill up. Make trickles of plat selling items with no hope to
recover plat spent skilling up and then boom new recipe comes out and you
are rich.

One method of making plat is to have both the platinum and velium item for
sale and offer a guaranteed trade in price to folks buying the plat item (
or gold etc) then wanting to buy the velium item later. Keeps customers
looking for you and keeps the trickle going.
