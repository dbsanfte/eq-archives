You're kidding, right?    I never bought the warrior version of the same.
When are you actually going to use this?   If you have an enchanter doing
crowd control, you just broke every mez at once.   If you're having casters
root park, you aren't in range of the extra mobs anyways.


So you're only going to use it for soloing  with no crowd control, if you
pull two at once?   5 AA's for something I'll use once in a blue moon, that
only does 1 extra hit to each extra mob, on a 10 minute recharge, unless I
want to spend 15 - 20 more AA's to reduce the timer to 7 mins.
