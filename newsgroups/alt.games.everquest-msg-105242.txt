I have also suspected it was this way, though I've never empirically
tried it to test it deliberately.

Someone should try this - get a L60 warrior or rogue in top notch
gear, group em with a 41 or 42 or so. They can get exp together (kill
something blue to the 60 to test it if you need to). Then let the 60
go on a rampage somewhere full of L35 mobs, say deep Mistmoore or SolB
if its not crowded, or perhaps echo caverns which is NEVER crowded.

The L60 can tear those mobs up, going through several a minute
(hopefully their partner can snare :-p ). It might be a nice alternate
way of powerleveling someone.
