I had a look at the website last night and I'm thinking about trying it
out tonight.  A couple of questions spring to mind though:

1)  How do they get away with that?  Did they get permission or
assistance from Sony?  If not, surely Sony would have a strong case for
stopping them running.  (I'm not a lawyer so I don't know what they
would sue for but it just seems wrong that they can do this without
permission)

2)  If they didn't get permission from Sony, how did they do it?
Reverse engineer the EQLive client or perhaps examine all the data
transmitting between the client and the server.  (Again I don't know
anything about either method but both sound to be huge tasks to me)
