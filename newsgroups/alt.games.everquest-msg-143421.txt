You are looking at the wrong solutions to the question (even VI are getting
it wrong).
The problem isnt there in the low end of the game, but arises as you get
higher. We may be fooled to look elsewhere for an answer... but I will tell
you the only true answer:

MOB CONs are all underconned beginning somewhere at level 20-30. They all
hit like warriors (no matter class), and have superiour HP, MANA, cast times
(etc, insert uber stats here). At around level 25, MOBs are getting more
"overpowered" compared to PCs, this seriously hurts the clerics/hybrids
ability to tank them like they did previously to 20th level.

Example:
At level 1, you can solo tank white CONs with no armor.
At level 60 you can only dream about soloing white CONs.

Somewhere along this line, something goes way out of balance... and its not
the PCs.
