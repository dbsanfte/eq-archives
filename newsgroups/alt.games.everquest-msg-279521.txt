Depends what you mean by high end. Ancient Dominion is a pretty serious
raiding guild that does 3 days a week, but Tide and Darkwind are very
high end - as in they quickly beat the end encounter in the latest
expansion, rather than being 1 or 2 behind.

Eclectic. AB is a server merged from at least 4 seperate servers, 2
of which were non english speaking. Find the folk you like and stick
with them ;)

Yeah, well, clerics are always in demand ;) If you want a post Anguish
guild but dont want to raid much you may be out of luck ;)
