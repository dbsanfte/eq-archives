One to add, don't use outlook as it seems to be the main virus propagator.
I'm currently using outlook and getting tired of having to worry about it.
I used to use a great free mail program called pegasus. Is that still
around?  What other readers are out there?  Hell, is cnet still around?

Over the years of upgrading os's and buying new pc's it just got easier to
use what came with it so I quit following these things.  I used to swear by
pegasus and free agent.
