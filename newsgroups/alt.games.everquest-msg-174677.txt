    That's the model for a guild like ours. But not for someone that's
actually challenged by AL/XTC/HP etc.

    Slacker. Best CLR weapon in the game, off a zero-risk mob, and you
stopped checking? This from the same guild that has 60+ Dain belts? Even if
you don't actively clear the guy, at least check towards the end of the
raiding day!

> We too gave shamans/druids GRC first.. but clerics got copies too

    AND you killed AL-cycle enough times to equip all druids, shamans, and
paladins and some clerics? You may complain about the competition on Prexus,
but you sure seem to win a lot of races! ;-)

    No kidding. You know my guild's playerbase and model - we have about 130
members, and maybe 60 show up to the average raid. Well, as soon as a raid
on something that drops a 16 damage poker was announced, all these rogues
started logging on. And we cleaned all the twinks out of the guild roster
and moved them into our twink guild, Lotus Buds, so they couldn't have been
sitting on an alt and heard the raid call. It was eerie.

> But again - omg 12 rogues!  Avg for us was more like 2/raid!

    Yeah, we usually get 4 on a given night. Except last night. Last night
we were scheduled to do Agnarr for our first time, and he was the last mob a
lot of people needed to get elemental plane flagged.

    /who guild
    There are 101 players in Bastion of Thunder.

    It was just awful. The elevator in PoK killed more people after the raid
than all the fights up to Karana. Did you know that with over 100 people in
a room, your screen actually freezes with every pulse of AoE Manasong? I
wish /serverfilter was fixed. =(
