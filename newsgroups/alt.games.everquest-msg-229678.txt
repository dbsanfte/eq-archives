A) Please don't top post in the AGE newsgroup

B) Since people exist with maxed out skill in every trade skill, there 
will be people who get to see every recipie in the game, discovered or 
not.  Some of those people will post them to the net, so they will be 
available for everyone.

Do you -have- to look on the net?  No.

Personally, I don't mind this too much, since they've apparantly made 
many recipies far too hard to figure out; the designers have stated that 
half the recipies already in the game have yet to be discovered, despite 
some being there since launch.  This could double the number of things 
trade skills can do, and perhaps there are some nice little gems hidden 
away in there; trade skills are largely worthless, so any additional 
candy would be very welcome.

But I'm trying to demonstrate how your point about the "trivial or near 
trivial" shouldn't keep anyone from being able to find out any given 
formula, unless perhaps some of the top end stuff that doesn't ever 
become trivial is too high even for the "way out of your league" loophole.

Splendid
