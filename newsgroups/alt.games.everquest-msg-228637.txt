TPP clearly -does- have a AC component, you  even say so here.

However, it doesnt' have the AC in slot 4, its in slot 8.  This could 
allow it to stack with the temp line which has its AC in slot 4... but 
leaves me with the mystery of why ShoW seemed to overwrite TPP, when it 
too has its  AC in slot 4.

I'd also suggest to the game designers that the AC in the whole phantom 
armor line -all- be moved to slot 8, consistant with TPP and allowing 
mages the benefits of their self buffs without losing the Temperance + 
lines that other classes have access to.

But since thats low level class balancing, I dont expect anything to 
come of the idea.

I'm going to find a cleric and do some testing here later today, I'm 
very glad to hear that this seems to work, although frankly I'd still 
rather have POT9 than Virtue, there are tons of Virtue casters out there 
(more than KEI vendors sometimes it seems) and being able to have my HP 
regen while wearing Virtue HP will be a treat, with the mana regen on 
top of it as a bonus.
