The only time I found that spell to be of use was when working on the
Shaman epic quest. There is a part of the quest where you have to wait
in shark infested waters for various NPC's to spawn. If you have invis
to animals, you can stay invisible to the sharks while you talk to the
NPCs. In that one case, the spell was very useful.
