Not sure I know what you mean by cheapest site. You buy EQ , get one month
free time (excluding your phone call charges) then it costs you 9.99 US
dollars to play each month after that.
With regard to speed , when you play the game you connect to the EQ server ,
ALL of which are in the USA. If you want to play with people from your own
country then you need to find out which server to use for your time zone. I
<don't think> lag is a problem whatever part of the world you connect from.
Ask fellow Aussies through this newsgroup what servers they use before you
create your first character, you cannot move a created character to another
server, so if you have friends in <real life> that you want to play with,
find out what server they are on.

If you decide to buy and are an RPG fan, be prepared to loose a big chunk of
your real world life, like tens of thousands of others. This game should at
least carry a government health warning, its nickname to many is EverCrack
:)

I have been playing Comp games for 20 years and have NEVER been sucked in
like I have with EQ. Go to http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ and
http://eq.castersrealm.com/ to get a flavour of how big this game is, then
go out and buy it and join the countless tens of thousands of EQ addicts.
There are people who have been playing EQ for two and a half years and still
have not <finished> the game. The game is constantly updated and revised and
a full blown expansion pack comes out about every 12 months, next one coming
at Xmas.
