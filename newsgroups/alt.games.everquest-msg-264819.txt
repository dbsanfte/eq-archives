Yes, Priests get the first Minor Ward but after that all of the Ward 
upgrades are Shaman only.

Less than that. In a tough fight I am spamming Wards as fast as I can cast 
them. Because they have a recast timer (probably 30 seconds, don't recall 
offhand), it's not exactly spamming, more like synchronized execution with 
the other periodically cast spells like my DoT (high damage but short # of 
ticks) and of course my primary heals. My initial Slow lasts five minutes so 
that's a one-shot deal. But I'm definitely casting Ward more than anything 
else during the fight, and usually quite a few times.
