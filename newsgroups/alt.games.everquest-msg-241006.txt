That's odd.  As I've mentioned before, I have a crap system, but with
DirectX 9.0b installed, I was still able to log on and run around.

Here's the breakdown:

P2-Cel 330, 128MB PC100 SDram, 32mb Voodoo4 vid card.

Prior to the patch, the game was playable, especially in old world and
LDoN.  Zone times sucked, but with all models off it was accpetable.
Clip plane could be extended in old world at least.

With the new patch, I can still play the game.  (I was stunned.  I had
tried it on test several weeks back and all i got was npc names
floating in a grey fog.)  However, the lag and chop were unbearable.
I used fraps and was peaking at 5 fps, if I was staring at a wall or
running around with the overhead view.  Had to drop clip plane to 5%
in old world even, and even then I could not move through the zone.

So what appears to be happening is that any DX9 stuff the video card
can't handle is getting transferred back to the CPU to be rendered in
software.  ( I suppose.  What I don't know about 3d graphics could
fill a book on 3d graphics).  So on my crap system, that software
rendering makes a barely acceptable machine a pathetic baby tortoise
struggling to find the ocean.

Anyhoo, said some goodbyes in game and cancelled the account.  If I
manage to get a decent rig prior to WoW / EQ2 / Doom3 / HL2, I might
even come back, but that remains to be seen.
