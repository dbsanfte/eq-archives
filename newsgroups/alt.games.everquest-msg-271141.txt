This is silly. You really think temp in his 20's is going to prevent a 
warrior from learning aggro management by his 60's? If it does there was 
never any hope to begin with! LOL!

A warrior who contributes to his own healing at 60? As a cleric I've 
never met one but then even if he did, do you think I care about him 
being able to bandage? With me around he's never going to need to. 
Bandaging is so slow that with FT15 in gear, a horse, KEI, etc. and a BP 
that CHs with no mana I ain't waiting for him to bandage up.

Again, by the time you are grouping with this guy, I'm sure he'll be 
fine. And what's to know about coping with dispelled Virtue other than 
you just lost a lot of hitpoints.

Paying for temps did absolutely nothing to prevent me from advancing in 
the game and aquiring nice gear over time. I doubt it will have much 
effect on him either. You have to remember that the higher he gets the 
more likely that decent buffs are going to be free in his groups 
anyways. How often is he going to be grouped without a cleric?

Would you suggest that any warrior could ever solo for gear worth having 
at higher levels? I know you wouldn't. He won't be soloing by the time 
he can play with you. I'd say, don't worry about it.
