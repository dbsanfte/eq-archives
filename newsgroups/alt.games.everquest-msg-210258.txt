: For Spell Haste 2 you're probably looking at a Fine Antique Corset,
: which is quested out of Plane of Knowledge.  It basically requires
: running around to all the expansions and foraging an item (some of them
: can take a while to forage and are only found in high-level zones, but
: you can stick to the zone walls and be pretty safe).  The good news is
: that all the items are droppable, so it's possible to just buy 'em up or
: find a friend to forage 'em for you.  Another option to look at might be
: a Mithril Runed Tunic, though I have no idea what they sell for.
: Unfortunately with the Droga/Nurga revamp the Fine Cut, Diamond Inlaid
: Mask isn't much of an option any more.  Though you may be able to find a
: nice bard or enchanter willing to escort you into the hand-in guy.
: Djarn's Amethyst Ring is also very nice for this one, but somewhat
: pricey.


I actualy just did the Fine Cut, Diamond Inlaid mask Quest with my level 1
necro.  Total cost to do the quest is one Sarnak Blood and 2 Swirling Smokes
( cost about 11p each, but you should have 2 -3 at all times any way since
you never get an invis spell) Get the map from EQmaps .com and turn on you r
LoY map. use one of your Swirling smokes just before you get to the first
set of goblins.  There is a hidden drop(cost me  18 HP at 12 stones) I would
sugest finding someone that ha done the quest before to guide you through
there it is a little confusing, but verry doable and probably the cheapest
Spell Haste II item you can get.

Here is the item:
Fine Cut, Diamond Inlaid Mask : LORE ITEM,  MAGIC ITEM,  NO DROP
AC: +3,  Sta: +3,  Wis: +3,  Int: +3,  Magic Resist: +3,  HP: +10,  Mana:
+10
Weight: 0.6,  Classes: All Classes,  Races: All Races,  Inventory Slot: Face
Focus Effect: Spell Haste II

There are quite a few easy quests for Fine Antique items out of PoK they all
originate in the same building. THey normaly require you to colect 4 items
but in the box hit combine and return.  I think only one of them require a
no drop item, so you may be able to buy the items that you need to compleat
the quest.
