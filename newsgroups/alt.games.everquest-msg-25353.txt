Ding! His complaints are just like a roleplayer saying that the system
announcements "ruin the roleplay experience". If someone can't keep
the IC and OOC elements seperate, it doesn't mean it's a bad RP
environment, it means they are a bad roleplayer...

Do LARPers decide that they can't roleplay because some nitwit who's
not in the game doesn't play along? Not the good ones. Do tabletop
gamers feel their AD&D game is ruined because someone turns on the
stereo? Nope.
