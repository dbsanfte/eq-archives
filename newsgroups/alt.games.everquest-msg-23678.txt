Sigh.

Actually, that opinion, while true for the higher levels is
almost totally inaccurate sub 50.

Rogues will pretty much always outdamage folks if they can get
nicely stuck in behind the critter and have a decent pokey stick,
its true.

Up to about level 40-45 rangers have much the same defensive and
offensive skills as a warrior, can cast, and have armour only
a few AC lower - not enough to make a noticable difference log
parsing (Ivy chain is high AC). The HP difference tends to be
small enough that CH isnt a huge amount less efficient on a ranger
at these levels as well.

Once you get to your mid forties, lower 50's rangers stop being
able to tank well at all and rely on aggromanagement tools, and
their HP is low enough that it becomes significantly more mana
efficient for a cleric to CH a warrior than chain GH a ranger.

On the other hand their spells get significant bumps and the
oppurtunity for some mean ranger only weapons comes up and there
are some exclusive ranger only buffs around.

As to the original question, Monks and Rogues remain pretty
nasty damage dealers throughout their lives... Rangers do nice
damage and provide a lot of utility and in the end game warriors
become the ultimate, and in some cases *only*, viable tanks.
