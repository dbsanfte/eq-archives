I run all models, 1280x1024, spell effects on, textures high. (spell 
effects don't matter because nobody is casting during the experiment).

At any rate, I'm not disputing you; I just haven't run into a need to 
tweak my clipping plane to lev somewhere myself. I'm sure that now we're 
trying we can find something that I couldn't lev to now, but could with 
no clipping plane...

That said, one of my solutions to increase lev distance is to look up, 
which I'd thought simply counteracted some of the downward motion?? but 
maybe looking at the empty sky also improves fps??

That's two tables. I've seen several faction tables that all vary a bit 
on the exact numbers; but they're all in the same general area. 
Personally I tend to prefer the second table, because it fits my 
greenmist experience and the 2000 hits rule, whereas the first doesn't. 
 
Specficically; if I start out an eru sk at -1000 (scowls, and a nice 
round number too), and max my faction with +2000 hits I will reach +1000 
warmly. Which is exactly what happened. 

On the first table, there is no way to go from scowls to warmly in 2000 
hits.

Its possible the 2000 hits rule is wrong, but its the *one* point that 
everyone seems to agree on. And it fits my experiences too.

My understanding of faction is that it maxes after 2000 hits assuming 
you haven't done any negative hits against it (that's what i was 
referring to with the +/-2000. So you'll get the message you can not 
improve your faction more after only 2000 hits from your starting point. 
Everyone appears to agree on the 2000 number and its in line with my own 
experiences.

The point is: if you started at minimum faction of -2500 then the most 
you'd ever be able to get is 2000 hits to -500 which is dubious.

There is a fair bit of controversy over where the actual top and bottom 
are (+/- 2500, +/- 3500, +/- 4000...) but it doesn't really matter most 
of the time because if you start at indifferent/threatening/kindly you 
cant get to +/- 4000 anyway.

The only time it matters is in fringe cases where you start at a 
hypothetical -2000 and then ruin it to the minimum... -2500, -3500, -
4000... as it would be a lot more work get it from -4000 back to your 
max of 0, than it would from -2500.

Its also relevant in our case, as, if your assertion that FV starts at -
3500 is true then its impossible to get it above -1500... which is still 
'ready to attack' (on either table).

There is a messge on allas about an iksar sk who maxed fv faction and is 
still scowling... so that lends some credence to your -3500 number. 
(although maybe he'd inadvertantly lowered FV before checking...or 
conned the wrong mob, or is just an idiot... one post is never 
conclusive =) Plus there is some evidence that an iksar monk was able to 
get to dubious.

Given both are iksar, and both are cazicthule; it would seem unlikely 
that one would be able to get in and one couldn't. Unless there is a 
faction mod for class... which is a generally considered not to be the 
case... and I don't think I've seen conclusive evidence either way.

At any rate, all the faction knowledge I've got argues against needing 
7000 faction hits to max a faction. As I see it; either you can get to 
dubious in FV in 2000 hits from your starting point or you can't. If you 
can it will take 2000 goblins at most and then you'll be at max faction 
with FV. if you can't do it in 2,000 you can't do it at all (barring 
tools like sneak, invis, illusion, alliance songs, or faction 
equipment).

thoughts?
