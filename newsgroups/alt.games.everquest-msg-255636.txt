This is the point where the argument loses a little steam. There comes a 
point where it becomes a splitting of hairs. If the achievements of the 
"brains" happens to have the side effect of also benefitting the "brawn", 
is that such a bad thing? It's not like this "brawn" didn't contribute by 
playing their respective role, and those "brains" couldn't have succeeded 
without them. (Yeah, yeah, don't even mention the dead weight you might 
find in some raids. That shouldn't factor into the base logic.) I mean any 
sports coach will tell you that the bench is pretty darned important to the 
victory, too.
