You are correct, AFAIK, in cases where EQ uses the words "Damage
Bonus".  I believe, however, that what Erik called a damage bonus
above is actually Bane Damage vs. Undead, which is added to the
base damage of the weapon before STR/Offense/WeaponSkill/Level
modifiers are applied.  At least, judging by the hits I've seen
a Ranger lay on Gnolls with a Gnollslayer (10/40 with 15 Bane
vs. Gnolls, or something like that, ends up 25/40 like Wurm), I
am convinced that is the way Bane damage works, this guy's hits
would've been much smaller if Bane damage was like damage bonus.
