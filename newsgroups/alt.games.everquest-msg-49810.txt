Yep I do. I essentially have win98 for playing games, and win2000 for 
everything else. If you can wipe the machine clean, install win98 first
with a couple of gigs in a partition at the beginning of the drive. Then
install win2000 after that. Win2000 looks out for the win98 partition and
sets up the boot loader so you can easily load both. If your short on
space, you can get away with installing win98 with a little over a gig of 
space and still install EQ I think. 

Win2000 was ok for playing EQ. For me, it tended to have a few more problems
than win98. So at some point I just uninstalled it on the win2k side and
only play it in win98 now. A lot of times game companies make no guarantees
whether their games will run on win2000 or not...though they usually do
if you've got the right drivers, especially for video cards.
