Ah, but mana level isn't why he's not casting it:  it's the money
issue.   He says he'll cast if the tank gives it to him, so mana
level isn't an issue.   Any tank that dies at that point has a very
legitimate gripe;  300 HPs won't last long, but often long enough
when the tank only has 1200 or so to start.   Those extra ticks
when the tank is fighting may be enough to get off another heal,
or for the mob to turn and run.

My only point:  not carrying components strictly because of the
cost for a major line like Symbol is a bad decision.   It's much
better for the cleric to make sure he gets enough loot to make
up for it.   He expects tanks to understand why they're not being
Symbol'd, but would rather they accept not being Symbol'd instead
of having them make sure he gets to loot his fair share to make up
for the cost.

So, he's already explaining the problem.   Now he has to have the
tank make a decision.   He picks having the tank choose "Symbol,
or another group?"   Isn't it MUCH better to have the tank choose
"Fair loot, or find another group?"   And doesn't the latter choice
also benefit the other casters as well?

Certainly telling the tanks about the cost and telling them it's a
good idea to carry their own is a "good thing."   It's his choice
after doing that that will end up with him having a reputation as
a cleric to avoid.   And, as you point out, it's NOT going to get
better.  Naltron is a lot more expensive, and a lot more critical
to use.
