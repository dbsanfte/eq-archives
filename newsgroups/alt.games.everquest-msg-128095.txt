Hi all.
I feel really stupid asking this question...but has anyone ever got out of
the pool in Sanctus Seru?
I was hanging around Sanctus waiting for a friend to finish banking, I was
doing nothing, so I thought I would skill up my swimming and wind
instruments. So...I cranked up Aquatic Ayre and into the handily placed
swimming pool in the centre of Sanctus I jumped. Once my friend sent me a
tell that he was finished, I swam to the side and tried to get out.
Hmm....no joy there, maybe I should try jumping at an angle to the side to
get out....still no joy. I petitioned in the end, but of course, got no
reply and after 30 minutes of doing laps, I gave up and played my druid for
a bit.

Has anyone had the same experience? Did you find any way out?
