Bah, maybe bards now have fashion sense, but when I was coming up,
most of us looked like an explosion at a crayon factory.  I have
screenshots of me in red boots, dusky gold plate pants, shiny gold
chain bp, black arms, green wrists, and purple gloves.  I've always
figured we were part harlequin.

I wouldn't worry about restarting.  I have the bare minimum STA as a
wood-elf also, and I've never really worried about running out of
stamina during a battle.  You have STA regen songs so just twist them
in when you get worn out.  I *do* miss the HP that another 25 STA
would give, but I'm basically equivilant to a 58 monk now, so I'm not
sweating it.

Damn, this is better gear than I had at 50.  Here are a couple
upgrades you could consider:

Head-Skull Shaped Barbute AC13 +35HP +10MR--Ghoul Lord in Lower Guk,
25-50pp in EC
Waist--FBSS--Frenzied Ghoul in Lower Guk, couple kpp in EC or 20AC one
from Maiden's Eye.  No drop, but Chimp could most likely solo the
mobs, then log on the bard and loot.
Wrist--Maybe Hero Bracer, wore one of those until 59, quest or buy
500-1000pp
Hands--SS Gloves.  The EB effect works from level 1, and being able to
hunt underwater is always good.  500pp or so.
Get a better stringed instrument, even if it's just a combine lute,
faster regen alone makes it worth the effort.  I'm not sure if the FV
quest tambourine makes sense now that Walrus skin drum is so cheap,
and you really don't need percussion much until late 30s.
You don't have a back slot item listed, there are a number of good
AC/stat items available for 1-5kpp.
