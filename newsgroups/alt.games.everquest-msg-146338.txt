    Royal Guards and Shik'Nar Warriors in Fungus Grove. Level 60, very
chain-pullable. Done them before in guild groups with silly compositions (2
warriors, 2 clerics, druid, bard is not what you call "high DPS") and still
can grind through them fairly fast. The two Royal Guards ALWAYS drop either
a Chitinous Belt or Brown Chitin Leggings, and have like a 30 minute-range
respawn time. The only tough part is the initial break, when you likely have
to also kill Warlord A'Name'I'Cannot'Spell (drops Brown Chitin Arms and
something else, but has a long respawn).

    Is EQ really that dreary? Punch the clock, time to rack up the XP?
