Where in the article did it indicate the kid's ancestry, race
or ethnic background ? 

There was nothing in the article that stated that he
was Mexican of mixed race descent, which is suggested
by the term " La Raza " . Also it did not say that
a whole race or ethnicity tortured a dog, just that 
one person did. The whole concept of a group of
millions of human beings torturing one dog is 
blatantly absurd.  

The article did not state where his ancestors came
from or if he was a person of mixed white, Indian, and/or
black descent. In fact his race was not even stated
in the article.

" Youth tortures dog " is a more accurate header.
While I do not condone PC of any kind this is 
just plain stupidity which makes you, Larry Greenburg,
look bad too.

BTW, are you " Baja Rat " under a pseudonym trying
to hide your white supremacism under a Jewish cover ?

Perhaps a better header
