That error has absolutely *nothing* to do with your graphics card.  Did the
guy you talk to have a foreign accent and sound like he was reading a
script?  =P

More than likely you have a macro program locking the files that need
patched.  I have to disable my N50 everytime there's a patch for exactly
that reason.  Another possibility is that the files have been set to
read-only.
