No the book isn't up to date.  The only thing relative to the Prima
guides statement of Intimidation is the acquisition of "Panic Animal"
at level 22.. and no, it's not listed as a spell in the Prima listing.
If I'm thinking correctly you are referring to the EQ Ruins of Kunark
book... and much has changed apparently.  Individual patches and the
release of Scars of Velious changed things for Rangers.  I pretty much
rely on http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Ranger
in order to keep up to date with changes... along with reading the
patch messages.

The Prima Kunark guide indicates that you can get SoW at lvl 39, but
in it's actually available at lvl 30 for Rangers.  Call of Sky isn't
even listed as a spell at all in the book, but it's a Velious Ranger
spell at level 39... and so on and so forth.  

I'd love to have a Ranger Mentor, but much of what I find out I do on
my own by researching on the web and kindly asking higher level
Rangers if I they can spare a couple of minutes to offer advice.

I'm currently at level 39 myself and I'm learning more about how to
play this Ranger every single day.  I've got a little gnome enchanter
I started the other night... Airee is her name.  Looks like there will
be more research and woot!  just in time... the enchant ore spells are
available in non-hostile territory now!
