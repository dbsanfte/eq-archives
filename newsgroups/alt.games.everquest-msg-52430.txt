 I'm one of those Wizzies that could have KSed a melee camping Hadden.
I went through this same sort of thing (not the GM thing, I yielded to
the other guy although I knew he was a Farmer, he actually admitted it) and never got the
fishbone for several frustrating weeks.
 
 I finally went someplace else, got enough loot/plat and simply bought
one in Freeport. Lots easier.   8^/
