With the casting AI changes, she's a bit smarter as a caster now.

On Torv, she sat up without being killed for about five months while 2
or 3 open raids a week tried to take her down. Finally, three of the
"lower tier uber" guilds got enough of a team together to take her out
once a week or so until we cleared out our collective need for paladin
books and the like. Of course, once we did, everyone screamed about
how we were ignoring reservations and killstealing from the little guy
(who hadn't been able to kill her in five months.)

Incidentally, this was before the casting changes, so sometimes it has
nothing to do with the MOb getting tougher.

I just have you accidentally killfiled.
