Frankly, I don't see Jakugg and Tiru making a come back any time soon.

I think what is more likely to happen is we'll explore a lot of post-50 
zones in the quest for 60, and when 60 gets here, SW:G will be released. 
  Then Jakiss will go the way of Jakugg, and who knows what Jak 
incarnation will be blowing up the rebels. And I'll probably start 
playing my mage Tirea or something else solo, with occassionaly 
tradeskill boughts on SW:G.

EQ2 is not something we're keen on, but it's been nice to get this far.

I've been a wee burned out of late, but maybe I'll start playing again 
on Friday and recapture some enthusiasm. I just got a brand new pute; it 
sucks not to go someplace I couldn't before (luclin, POP). Look for us 
in Fungus Grove, killing guards in Katta or SSeru, or something along 
those lines.
