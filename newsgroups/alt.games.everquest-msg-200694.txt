Only one of the snares is being changed significantly, the level 63 spell 
is being dropped from a max of 75% to 61% snare, still, a very nice snare 
if you ask me, but, not significantly better in it's snare effect than one 
or two of the lower level necro snares now.  On a related note, looks like 
the low level Ranger snare is being increased in effectiveness.

Also saw that HoS is being made more uber, they are adding 1hp to it.  :b
