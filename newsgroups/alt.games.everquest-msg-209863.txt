"Lost Dungeons of Norrath - Raid Content
In designing Lost Dungeons of Norrath, we haven't forgotten about those who 
enjoy raiding.  In addition to the multitude of rewarding single-group 
adventures, LDoN also includes exciting and challenging events targeted at 
six groups or less.

For the first time, raids take place in truly private zones, where your 
groups can test their mettle and focus solely on the task at hand.  Instead 
of limiting the availability of content by who can get there first, this 
new system only limits participation based on whether or not you have 
recently succeeded or failed at each event within a given period.  This 
allows us to place a heavy emphasis on skill, while remaining in control of 
the influx of new items into the game.

While our primary focus for LDoN is the single group experience, we are 
working diligently to ensure that these new raids are centered around the 
principles of organizational tactics, individual skill, and most 
importantly - fun.  

We feel that the core content and rewards in the Lost Dungeons of Norrath 
expansion will entertain and benefit even the most experienced players.  We 
are aware of the desire for high-end raid content and will continue to 
address and meet those needs over time.

- The EverQuest Team"
