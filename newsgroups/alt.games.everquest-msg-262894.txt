I think the point is to return at least part of the game to the old
"feel"... The gear game, that is. I really do miss the days when
people actually used Bronze, banded, and fine plate rather than
considering it vendor trash or skillup fodder and nothing more. Would
the system Lance proposes work to recapture those days? I can't say.
Unfortunately, it's kinda too late, anyway. At least for me. I burned
out on EQ, and part of it was the feel of adventure and making your
way in the world was gone. The roleplay with my guild was all I had
left, and I've even let that go neglected long enough that I can't
really stay in it anymore.

EQ2, maye? It seems to be built around the casual player/roleplayer
style in a lot of ways. I played the WoW ST, and they seemed to handle
things well there. Right now, my main interest is CoH, and a big part
of that is because there's no need to play the gear game.
