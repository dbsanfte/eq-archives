My what limited imaginations you people have. You don't think its a
dungeon because it has three guards and is small?

Its a main tunnel from SH to DS, but its not kept in good repair, so
all the netherbian tunnels are starting to connect to it. God, its not
just an obvious dungeon, its almost a cliche dungeon.

Try going off the main path sometime and tell me its not a dungeon.
It's a classic dungeon, a design type so old it was around when
dungeons as part of a rpg were first conceived. "The mayor wants your
party to investigate the high road to Sanctus Seru. He hears that some
evil netherbians have tunnelled from their lair to the road and are
preying on passersby...."


>Btw.. The easy XP from killing the guards there are now broken.. there is a
>faction message now :((

There always should have been. What I would have done was put in a
hidden faction adjustment so all those lazy boogers find themselves
kos in SH.
