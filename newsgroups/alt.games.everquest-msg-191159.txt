 We're not. But I'm not going to stand around all day waiting for a heal
when I don't think I need one. This all depends on where I'm pulling
though. If outdoors someplace like PoV where I can get SoE, I wont
bother getting topped off. Switch to Tactics (Much hate for RZ event)
though and I wont run off at 75% or less. Those guys run just a little
too fast and hit a little too hard. I need all the hp I can get.
