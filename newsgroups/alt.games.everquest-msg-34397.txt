I strongly recommend that all newbie players take up the tailoring skill. Get
yourself a small sewing kit off of one of the merchants who have set up shop
outside; it will only cost you 2 or 3 gold. Buy some patterns from the guy
merchant or from the pattern merchant in Misty. Combine one pattern and one
ruined pelt to make a piece of patchwork armor. You can put some practice points
in to tailoring (up to 20), but even if you don't, patchwork should succeed more
often than not. For free practice, kill spiderlings and combine two silks to
make a silk thread; it will always succeed and you will raise your skill. There
you go... for a few silver (the cost of the pattern) you have some armor that is
good for another 5 or 6 levels.

As for armor, just stick with the rusty stuff that drops often enough from the
goblin warriors on the other side of the wall. That will do you also until 10th
or so.

> What lvl is 'semi-safe' in Kithicor Forest?

During the day, with some luck, a first level character can run from Rivervale
to West Commons with no problem. During the night, though (about 6pm to 8 or 9
am game time), Kithicor is VERY dangerous. We are talking level 55 mobs, here.
If it is already 4pm or latter, DO NOT EVEN TRY! Eventually, you as a rogue will
be able to make the journey safely, by combining hide and sneak, but not until
you are around level 40 or so, and even then there are dangers.

> Velium Short Sword for 20pp last night. Is this a good deal?

Velium weapons are a bit faster than fine steel; until you are around level 15,
though, the different is negligible. You can pick up a FS short sword (better
yet, a long sword) for about 10pp. Velium weapons do proc an effect of velium
shards (occasionally, more often with higher dexterity, the weapon will do
additional damage) but you have to be 25th or 30th level for that effect to
happen. Until then, you will see the occasional message of "Your will is not
sufficient to command this weapon." Unless you need a magic blade, don't bother
with velium weapons until then. Even if you need magic weapons (to hunt
willowisps, for example) there are other, cheaper weapons available.

> I am currently using a Rusty Battle Axe.

Again, rusty weapons will be fine for now, but save your cash. You can get fine
steel weapons for as little as 5pp, and a gnoll hide lariat (a not bad magic
1HB) for 7pp to 10pp.

Collect misty acorns (rare groundspawn in the Thicket, look like bright green
rectangles.) Halfling tailors (like Rosewhite Blossom, my main character on Xev)
will pay a plat *each*; some desperate tailors will pay as much as 3 or 5 plat
each. (They are used to make halfling cultural armor.) They stack, so don't
worry about bank space. Save quality wolf and bear skins (ie not ruined.) When
your tailoring gets better, you can use the LQ skins with silk thread to make
leather padding, which can be sold to upper skill smiths for 1pp or more each.
MQ bear can be downgraded to LQ for padding, HQ bear can be sold for 15pp to
20pp each (they are used to make tailored backpacks, a 10 slot large capacity
bag with 10% weight reduction) and MQ and HQ wolf is used to make small leather
armor by tailors (quality wolf is much more difficult to get than quality cat.)
Rosewhite pays 1pp for each MQ wolf and 3pp for each HQ wolf skin, but I don't
know many tailors who make small leather (which is silly, given how many
halfling druids there are.) They stack, so they won't take up a lot of bank
space, either. Don't bother saving the black wolf or other wolf skins.

It is a specific ruby that can only be gotten from Chomper.
