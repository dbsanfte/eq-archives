You will.  :)

And there will come a day when you decide that your pet just despises the
enchanter in the group and wants to see him die over and over and over
again...

I remember fighting in CT the day after the patch that said "Pets will no
longer break mez" and my pet was determined to prove that patch message
wrong.  As far as I can tell they never did manage to fix that issue, or if
they did it's broken again, as my pet was breaking mezzes in Chardok the
other day (have to take magician, as I keep my monk's faction maxed for a
now useless reason  :).

F8 is no biggie.  I'm a very active character, always moving, so positioning
and F8 are usually just as fast and safe as assisting.  With the new
targeting ring the chance of error is even less.  But you better be pretty
confident of your target selection if you make that standard practice.
