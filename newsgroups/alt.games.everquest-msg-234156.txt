My favorite is 4, because it works only to a point...

Equipping a level 11 toon with droppable gear from a 65 LDON will allow that
11 to play just about any way they want without regard for their actual
class abilities.  Re-equipping with elemental gear at 45 will again allow
this person to continue advancing without bothering with little things like
actually buying their spells.  I kid you not, I know a level 62 cleric who
never GOT AROUND to putting a point into specialization back at 30 and
thinks spell casting mastery is broken.  (I died twice because she insisted
that CH is the only heal spell a cleric needs.  You know what you get when
you cast CH on an enchanter?  A fully-healed corpse.)

But godly equipment on a low-level toon just means that person never learns
to play properly in many cases.  By the time the equipment is what they
SHOULD have equipped, they're so used to being relatively invulnerable that
now mobs can hurt them, they have no idea what to do.  Face it, a level 20
with 2k hitpoints is a god, a level 60 with 2k hp is an easy target.  Yet
they never learn; they expect other players to pick up the slack.

Being in a group with five of these types is... interesting.  But keep Gate
loaded.
