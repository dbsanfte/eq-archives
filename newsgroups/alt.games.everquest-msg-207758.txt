For most classes, Faction isn't easy to increase, its much simpler to 
get your charisma up instead.  There is a minimum price that any given 
NPC will let you buy something off him for, and since the drums for the 
drogmor don't come on multiple vendors, there's no shopping around 
involved. 

Assuming you are at indifferent faction or better, you will get the 
lowest possible price at a charisma of 106.  If your faction is worse 
than that for some reason (I can't think of one but I suppose there is 
some mob you could kill to hose faction with them) then you might have 
to go higher in charisma.  I've heard that with the worst faction where 
a vendor will still deal with you, you may have to go as high as 130 
charisma to get the best price.

So, -if- you don't have gear to get your charisma up to 130 (are you 
sure you are an enchanter?) then try casting your best faction increase 
spell.  I've only extremely rarely seen faction increase aggro a mob (my 
bard saw a few dark elves aggro on his faction song) and its highly 
unlikely that these vendors are flagged that way.

Also try various race illusions (PC races only, the non PC illusions use 
your real race)and see if they help.

But really, I seriously doubt you need more than 106 charisma, and 
considering enchanters get a charisma increasing spell line and the 
cheap availability of 50 charisma worth of gear in the form of a pair of 
opal encrusted steins...

The charisma pursuit is worth it though, my shaman cast his cha buff 
plus loaned his steins to someone who was buying a mount, and the guy 
split the savings with me... over 1000pp my share alone.
