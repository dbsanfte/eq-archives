Whilst I don't agree with a lot of what Hughes said...  what you just
suggested is so untrue its laughable.

Monks didn't tank better than warriors, period.   Low-end there was never a
problem.
High end?  Well for all Furors bitching and whining,  not once did he use
monks as MA's over his warriors...

If monks > warriors like he claimed, then why the fuck did warriors MA every
FoH kill?

Their discs go a long way in catching up with monks "advantages".  And you
forgot crippling blows, stunnable kicks at 55, bash...
