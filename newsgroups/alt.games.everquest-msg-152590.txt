I can imagine some people farming certain items in certain
zones and then crossing the world to sell them at a different
bazaar.  I think that would be cool, and have an interesting
effect on item prices.

Of course, I think part of the reason Verant implemented the
bazaar the way they did was to help sell the expansion.  In
fact, the only reason I bought Luclin was to have access to
the bazaar.

But doesn't the bazaar itself lead EQ in that direction you
don't like?  It's not like traders are at their keyboards.
They behave precisely like boring old NPC merchants.  So I
don't see the distinction: going to a trader that behaves
exactly like a merchant, or going to a merchant that behaves
exactly like a merchant.

The only thing that the consignment shop would do is allow
non-24/7 Internet access users to act like merchants too.
The potential downside I see is having a LOT more items for
sale at any given point in time, driving prices down even
further.  (I think most people would agree the bazaar has
driven down prices considerably.)

And don't think I'm trying to make everyone equal in terms
of the game.  Druids are not necros are not mages are not
warriors.  Wood elves are not dark elves are not gnomes are
not barbarians.  But it doesn't seem bad to try to put people
on equal footing in terms of their Internet connectivity.

It's kind of like bards.  My understanding is you just
plain don't play a bard on an analog modem.  Why?  You
can't control the song twisting nearly as well.  You end
up singing only 1 song (or twisting 2) instead of the
twisting 3 that broadband users get.  So why doesn't
Verant make it so bards can auto-twist some songs?
Would it hurt the balance and the gameplay?  Or just
reduce a bunch of cases of carpal tunnel while allowing
analog modem users to also play bards effectively?

(I've never played a bard so I'm just guessing on this
one.)

: Kaev <--- trying to be serious and flame-free, this time

But we see an "out of game mechanic" (your Internet
connection -- 24/7 vs. non-24/7) affecting an "in game
mechanic" (whether or not you can effectively participate
in the bazaar).

I have no problem with the races and classes being different
in the game, and achieving similar results in different ways,
but to not be able to leverage something in game (the bazaar)
because you have dial-up instead of broadband?  Seems wrong.
