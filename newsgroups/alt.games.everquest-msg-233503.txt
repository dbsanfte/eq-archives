I've only played one class with any regularity - magician.  I'm probably not
really qualified to speak about other classes, but here are probably the
races I would choose:

Magician, wizard, enchanter - Erudite, but Gnomes are fun.
Necro - Erudite or Iksar (for enhanced regen).  I'd probably go with Erudite
because at high level the lich forms take so many hp per tic the enhanced
regen from Iksar is not meaningful (just a guess).  Then again, it's always
fun to think about the evil thoughts running through a Gnome necro's mind.
Cleric, Paladin - I'd go Dwarf.  There's nothing that screams "Cleric" to me
like a nice stout Dwarf.
Warrior - Troll, or Dwarf if you want to have "good" faction or don't want
to deal with the Troll XP penalty.
Shaman - Barbarian.
Beastlord - Barbarian, but it's hard to pass on Vah Shir and the cool tiger
warder.
ShadowKnight - Troll.  Maybe Iksar if they can be SK's.
Druid - I do Wood Elf, but Halflings get an xp bonus.
Ranger - Wood Elf??
Upcoming Beserker - Dwarf all the way!

Regarding putting 25 points into cha/5 points into int on an enchanter, I
suspect that you'll find that it would been better to reverse those
allocations.  Mana is still the lifeblood of any pure caster class, even one
that charms and pacifies.  Give it a go as is and see what your results are.
