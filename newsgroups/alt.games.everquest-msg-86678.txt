One thing to keep in mind is as you level, the ammount of xp to go up
increases, but the amount for AA is constant.  At higher levels you are
fighting higher level mobs, or fighting the same and killing them faster, so
you are gathering at a higher rate.  My guild reccomends that you go 100% xp
until 56, then up to 10% AA until 60.  I'm currently 57, with 1 yellow
towards 58 and about 1 yellow of AAxp.  I'll keep it at 10% AA until I'm 60,
then up it to 50% until I'm halfway through 60, then put it at 90%.  If I
ever hit 4 yellow into 60, I'll put it all at AA.  That way if I die (even
multiple times) I'll keep my lvl.
