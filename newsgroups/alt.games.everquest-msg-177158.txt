No I can see why he'd be upset.  After all, why should he be Happy about the
situation?  But - Trust betrayed, items missing, and the largest chunk of
blame landing squarely on his own shoulders for giving out the info in the
first place - all that makes for a pretty upsetting situation. He gave the
information not for personal gain (NODROP looting, PL'ing, etc. ) but to
help out his in-game friends. And the results of his actions show betrayal
from at least one of those in-game friends.

To the OP, I would think that if the GMs know you willingly gave out your
information (regardless of circumstances) and your account was plundered,
that they would not return your stuff, though they might punish the account
abuser for violating their own rules. But still, I hope you get what you
want out of the situation, and come out wiser for it.
