That is not twinkage really but possibly knowing that plus 2 wis per
ring is not a big deal and you may as well skip to higher ones when
you can afford to do so. For example my shaman level 14 on the Firiona
vie server is not going to buy any jewelry at all until someone is
selling 4 ac 45 hp rings or above and the 3 ac 3 dis res or something
earrings. She'll probably buy those and the 4 wis 4 str veil. Tiny
bits of wis here and there just don't do much but the stuff i
mentioned right there would ad to her ac and 90 points to her hp which
would do something.
