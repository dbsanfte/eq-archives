    Nope, although AC has a fairly large, persistent set of players. Nothing
like EQ, but they're there. Interesting how a lot of the complaints about
AC - boring, bland gameplay - are also levelled at DAoC.

    One of my best buddies from EQ is sold on DAoC, though, and has to be
dragged back to EQ. He sees the slow regain rate of the mana bar and starts
bitching immediately. His big point seems to be that EQ demands a fairly
high investment of time, and he feels DAoC does not. *shrug* Not like I'm
doing anything else when the Canucks aren't playing. 8)
