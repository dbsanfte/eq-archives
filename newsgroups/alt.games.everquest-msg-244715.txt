Only way I can think of offhand is maybe MacroQuest.  Most applicable 
solutions I've seen (an autofire program or a gamepad) just emulate 
keyboard input, which requires that you keep the program you want to 
receive the input in the foreground.  MacroQuest may be able to deliver the 
commands to a backgrounded window (I really don't know, never used it, and 
only suggest it here because it's the only solution I can think of).

I do know it's a trivial task to set it up if you have a second computer to 
run the bot on, but that doesn't sound like the case here.

Another solution to consider might be making a hotkey like:
/pause timer, /doability 3
/pause timer, /doability 3
/pause timer, /doability 3
/pause timer, /doability 3
/t monual i need my hotkey refreshed!

and another hotkey with just /autoinventory a bunch of times to save 
yourself some clicking.  Would mean you'd have to switch back to that 
window every 10 minutes or so (anybody know what the actual refresh timer 
is on forage?  Never bothered timing it), but would probably be within the 
confines of the EULA.
