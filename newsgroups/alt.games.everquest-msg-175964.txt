Any specific reason to solo only? If you ever want to get past ..
say... 55, youll be forced to group at some point. (ive never solod an
SK - not sure how high you can get with one solo). If you dont want to
get frustrated and feel stuck, you are going to have to group
eventually. As we all know, grouping and soloing are 2 different
worlds. You might consider starting to group soon to sharpen up your
grouping skills. Mobs post 50 are a different matter entirely, even
moreso after 60. Pickup groups are very dicey. Developing a rappor
(sp?) with a consistant group of people - say guildies - is essential
and far more rewarding.
