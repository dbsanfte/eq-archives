The spawn of Faelin Bloodbriar, at +1500 +500 in GFay.  Anyone have any =
idea what the time frame would be for her to spawn? The sites are saying =
rare spawn.  I spent over 4 hours killing her placeholder that spawns in =
the same spot as her and was just curious if anyone has any idea of her =
showing up.  Thanks in advance
