Hey guys I just now started playing EQ again after a six month hiatus. My
enchanter is level 38 and I'm kinda at a loss as to where to go and what to
do. Anyone know any cool places to hunt monsters? I prefer to work in groups
but if someone has a good solo strategy, I'd be willing to give it a try.

Thanks
