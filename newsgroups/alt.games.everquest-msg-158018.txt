Yeah, this is cool. Six of my eight toons on Povar are non-porting
classes. The toon that was affected the worse by being a non-porter is
my kitty shammie. He left his home a while ago, been adventuring on
Antonica for a while. Spell runs to Halas from NK, when no druid port
available to SFG, were a MAJOR pain! Now, I can get to Nexus, hop to
PoK, take touch the Halas portal stone, and I am there!

PoK will has help make "impossible" CR's less impossible for melees.

I like the PoK portals very much. And, I would have purchased PoK just
for this, in fact, I did, considering I have no toons over 41st level
(yet).

I do have a porting Wizard now, just personal ports, so the addition of
these ports has had no effect on his "business" of porting.
