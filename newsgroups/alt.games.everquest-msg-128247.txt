Oh, I should mention that I don't have the keyboard utilities thing.  The
only extra keys I use are the volume and mute, which XP supports w/o goofy
programs.

I did have to load the mouse software for the mouse to track properly (it
was really jumpy, esp in eq without it).

Rule of thumb for me is to install as little of the included software as
possible.
