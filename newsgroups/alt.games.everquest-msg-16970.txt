Well at 29 you could hunt the fairies in lesser faydark. I bet you wont have
to share the spawn (or probably the entire zone) with anyone. Of course,
without wolfform, youll probably find out fairly fast, why this zone is
unpopular hehe.

Another possibility, but much more mundane, is hunting the giant skellies in
rathe mountains. I never found this to be very good xp, since after hunting
them for a while they tend to despawn to placeholders (just as the basilisks
in this zone too)

Love it or hate it... loio or overthere is the ticket.
