That's right.  The reward is NO DROP so the person who wants
it has to do the final combine.

No, the final combine is tradeskill dependent, ie a person
will use the artisan's seal and another item or items in
the tradeskill's container (a grandmaster fletcher in a
fletching kit, for instance) to make the trophy.  The mounted
gems required jewelcraft (under 176) and the artisan's seal
requires pottery (under 136.)  If you haven't mastered
jewelcraft but are a grandmaster fletcher it makes FAR more
sense to have a jeweler/potter who can make the seal do so
for you and then just do the final combine.

Geerlok devices are tinkered and give 5% to the relevant
tradeskill.  He (essentially) did his final combine at
258 skill in jewelcraft.
