Yes - you'll notice all your skills are marked "Apprentice I" - App 2
can be bought from trainers, App III must be made by artisans.  You
can buy them from tradeskillers, if you don't want to make them
yourself.

Yep.        :)

I'm 12/11 and don't intend to leave Qeynos for another 2-4 levels
(alone, at least).

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
