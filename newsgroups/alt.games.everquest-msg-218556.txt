Ah, no, an argument being fallacious does not make it a straw
man.  It makes it wrong, or at least makes it improperly
constructed... but heck, if I can prove your arguement is
fallacious then I win.

What you want to claim (and hopefully prove) is that the
arguement I'm attacking is NOT your arguement.  Then my arguement
(my attack on what I claim is your position) would be fallacious;
the "straw man fallacy" again.

Just saying so doesn't make it so, however.

You have two basic approaches if you want to discuss the issue.

1) Demonstrate that the argument being discussed is not your
arguement
or
2) Demonstrate that the conclusion I reach does not follow from
my attack on your arguement.

If you want to attack prong 1) then feel free; you've already
done so successfully on one occaision, so I changed prong 1) to
better fit what you seem to be saying.  

Are you saying that you don't pull consistantly when the healer
has announced various mana levels under 50%?  Cause I'm pretty
sure you -have- said that you do, but a retraction would indeed
destroy my position.

Are you saying that there is some source of mana that only
activates when people are LOM?  Cause that too would destroy my
position.

Are you denying saying that you would zone in with your cleric at
30% mana?

It seems to me that no, you normally are quite happy to maintain
mana running well down under 50% for long periods of time, and it
-also- seems to me that that point is all I need to address (ie
there are no secret bonus sources of mana that would have to be
included for fairness).

The argument YOU are using is a great example of a straw man.

You claim I am saying "I play like you" when I'm saying "I play
like you EXCEPT".  Then you attack me for a distorted version of
my argument (your version doesn't include the crucial EXCEPT)

Thats the straw man fallacy.

I, on the other hand, am attempting to take one facet of the many
differences between our play style to examine; the reason I'm
using a hypothetical group that mimics you in every regard except
one is that I don't want the arguement to bog down into those
other differences.

Why is this different from what you are doing?  After all, I'm
trying to cut out a lot of what you are talking about, too.  Ah,
but here's the difference, I agree that if group B were to mimic
you in every single way including starting mana, then it wouldn't
be any different from yours.  So we can dispose of that.  Do you
agree that if group B has the same plan as you in every regard
same starting mana that its better off than yours?  If so, ok,
end of arguement.  Otherwise, we've found a topic worth debating.

Are you attempting to claim that if my "group B" plays like you
in all ways except starting mana, then it plays like you in all
ways?

I thought of a fabulous example of what I'm talking about today. 
I was driving along and reached a section of the road thats under
construction; all traffic going my direction was pressed into a
single lane bounded by large concrete barriers; there would be no
chance of passing each other.  I was following someone at a good
three second follow distance (he passes something, I can count
one.... two.... three before passing it myself).  Behind me, some
idiot was following so close I couldn't see his tail lights;
perhaps half a second behind me.

Now pay attention, this is the analogy part:  The guy ahead of me
was driving at 40 miles per hour, I was driving at 40 miles per
hour, the guy behind me was driving at 40 miles per hour.  For 45
minutes, we maintained roughly this setup; if the guy ahead
managed to speed up (he was following people too, and had no more
real choice in his velocity than we did behind him) I'd speed up,
if he had to slow down, I'd slow down too.  The guy behind me did
the same thing... giving me the willies whenever I did have to
slow down and his hood would also vanish from view in the lag of
his reaction time.  

At the end of the construction area, I'd gone about 30 miles in
45 minutes, the guy ahead of me had gone 30 miles in 45 minutes,
the guy behind me had gone 30 miles in 45 minutes. 

The guy behind me wasn't able to drive any faster over the long
run.

But he -was- running a much higher risk of collision.

If you run a consistantly low mana group, you are essentially
tailgating, for the same reward; none at all.  Because over the
long run there's only so much mana available, and running at 30%
mana or 20% or 10% won't give you mana back any faster than
running at 80% or 70% or 60%; just as getting your Honda a car
length behind my truck won't get you thru the construction zone
any faster than driving at the same speed ten car lengths back.

Oh, and if the guy ahead of ME hits his breaks hard, or runs into
a ditch or something else unexpected and catastrophic happens, I
have a lot more reaction time available to do something about it
than that guy behind me would have; he's far more likely to crash
(sadly, he'll probably do so by hitting me, but that part isn't
really analogous to our mana discussion)

------------end analogy----------------

Now, lets examine your position again.  Apparantly you don't like
the idea that group B has 50% mana than your group at all times. 
And you don't want to keep coming back, more or less, to 30% mana
or any other rough target.

It seems to ME that what you really want to claim is that your
group somehow has more mana to spend than group B.  I keep trying
to state your position in some way that doesn't require this
obvious impossibility, but all I get is evasion.  If its your
position that your group actually has more mana available, please
say so, and I'll stop trying logic.

One tactic you've repeatedly used to try to evade the issue is
saying that people behave differently at different levels of mana
pool. If they do, then it would be possible that your perpetually
LOM group actually wastes less mana than a group that keeps a
more comfortable buffer. But in this case, I've circumvented that
by stating explicitly that group B (which isn't composed of real
people at all) behaves exactly like your group; this means that
no, they DON'T nuke or stun or root or recast Virtue an hour
before it runs out or stand around instead of sitting because
they are bored with having mana; perhaps a real group with that
much mana would do those things and use mana up till it got
lower, but group B isn't that creative, they do exactly and only
what you do, which is theoretically the best possible mana usage.

If you'd like to discuss some of the other issues I have with
your play style as I understand it, we can do that, but I'd like
to actually get somewhere on this single issue first.  Frankly,
you've drawn it out far past where I should have shrugged and
given up on you as a lost cause, but you -seem- coherant, and I'd
like to have people who can argue well and don't agree with
everything I say around; I enjoy debate and often find it
informative (note, this last means that sometimes I'm wrong).  If
you can't allow yourself to get pinned down to this single issue
and actually try and hash it out, then there's no use starting
discussions on any other topics with you, they'll just bog down
into endless rehashes where you'll continue to refuse to actually
address anything at all.
