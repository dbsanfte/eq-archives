you must hail the little dwarf and say "the dain must be slain for the peace
we shall obtain" just like that

he will depop and giants will spawn, in pairs, and come at you

the giants do get harder, and the final one should be 60

the best thing about this is that it can be repeated (provided you don't let
the dwarf escape)

the mobs in the plate cycle are notoriuos for dropping loot (heh, plate most
often)...and the final boss is almost a guarantee for some loot (it can be
something garbage like hands, but usually that's where to get bp's/legs . .
and only twice did i find him with nothing)

most times the other mobs in the cycle will drop loot (bracers, shoes . .
.helms are rare [dont ask me why] )

the biggest trick is to time the cycle against the static, boring spawns . .
and to have the dps to win, of course

and it is a TON of fun! good luck!
