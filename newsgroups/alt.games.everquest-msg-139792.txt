If you can afford the big bucks for a high-end LCD, go for it... they're
easier on the eye, and the technology has come on in leaps and bounds in the
last 2 years or so, 'ghosting', 'blurring' and poor refresh rates have been
cured on most of the better models... but avoid the cheap stuff, or you'll
end up disappointed.

I personally have a pair of 19" monitors in my home-office... they're big,
heavy, and they pump out a lot of heat between them... but their size means
I can sit a little further away, so eye strain isn't such a problem. Another
trick is having them at different distances, so even when I'm playing on
both at the same time, my eyes are focusing at 2 different depths, avoiding
a lot of eyestrain.

Budget as much as you can... and if it won't stretch to a *quality* LCD, go
for a big-ass CRT. If you haven't the space for 19"+ CRT or the money for a
good LCD... stick to a regular 17" CRT for now.

For eyestrain...
Look away from the screen every few minutes (touch typists suffer more than
us 'pic'n'peck' typists)
Take a break from the screen altogether every hour or so (get up, walk
around, grab a coffee/soda/whatever)
Don't sit too close to the screen
Work/play in a well lit room (avoid Flourescent light if you can)
Get your eyes tested every 2 years, and tell your optician you spend a lot
of time in front of a screen
