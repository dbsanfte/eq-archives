Can anyone tell me what "camping" actually means these days?  Here is
the scenario I've encountered, but first let me preface this with what
I think camping is.  From my understanding, camping is to stay at one
place camping either a specific mob or a group of mobs (for example,
the derv camp).  If I am wrong about this can someone please inform
me?

Now for the scenario.  Do any of you consider the hallway in Crystal
Caverns where the Geonid's spawn a camp?  For those that don't know,
the hallway where the genoid's spawn is pretty long where there are
about 10 genoid's between the entrance and exit of the hall.  For me,
I think it's a little extreme to consider the entire hallway a camp. 
It's like considering all the snow cougars on one of the islands in
Iceclad Ocean a camp.
Or the entire first level of befallen a camp.

Anyway, that's my question.  It's really not a big deal to me because
Crystal Caverns is such a great zone...err....I mean...Crystal Caverns
really sucks.  Don't waste your time going there.  There is no plat or
decent xp to be made.  Not only that, but even the low level mobs
double attack for 90.  Regardless of all that, I can understand why
someone would feel they have a need to camp every genoid spawn spot in
that hallway. But then again, it's like camping every snow cougar just
to get Midnight to spawn.  I don't think there's much of a difference
other than one zone is outdoor and one is a dungeon.  I can understand
it, but I still don't think it's a valid reason to camp an entire
hallway.
