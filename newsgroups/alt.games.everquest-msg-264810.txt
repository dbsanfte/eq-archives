Ah. I see. You appear to be very naive. 

1) A business that sends off its parting customer with a final insult 
only further increases the unliklihood that the customer will ever 
return, to any of its products. 

2) Plus further insulting ex-customers also incites them to make 
negative posts about your product and company, affecting the buying 
decisions of their friends, families, and the people at large.

Sure there will always be a couple kooks who you can't please and who 
want the moon. But most customers (even the ones who aren't your 
customer any longer) are generally satisfied with a little sincerity and 
respect.

I'm sure I've got little sympathy for the fine folks at anything.com 
who've registered all these domains for the sole purpose of setting up 
'search pages' whenever anyone mispells an URL. I quite expect they are 
rejecting incoming emails with a mailbox does not exist error, which 
hopefully is caught by the spammers and allows the address to be deleted 
from their mailing lists automatically with a minimum of fuss and 
bandwidth.

You, on the other hand, what do you have against kingston.net? (Seeing 
as you've seen fit to burden them with all your own spam.) I suppose if 
you've got a legitimate grudge I could have my spam forwarded there 
too...
