"Evade" is the name given by the developers to the practice
of turning off attack and pressing the "Hide" hotkey during combat.
If successful, it lowers you instantly on the Hate list.  If not successful,
well, it doesn't.

You do receive a success/fail message.

Also, it will NOT wipe the hate list completely, so if you're the only
on it (soloing) or jus waaaaaay too high to matter (soloing and
a passing druid tosses a DS on you), you'll still be fighting it.

It's not a get-out-of-death free card until level 59 with some
serious AA time put into play.
