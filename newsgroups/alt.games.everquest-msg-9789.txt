well it is rather a dumb weapon at least that is what my pally thinks.  A
paladin with a piercing weapon?  oh come on.

It's not like i spent my first levels with a knife killing stuff.  My guild
handed mine to me and said "here, nobody else wants this"  I said thanks and
now can't unload it on anyone.

I know putting points into all weapons is a good idea and practicing with
them.  But even where my skill sits with piercing now  I miss a lot.  hit
for 1 or 2 pts and occassionally get a 20 in there.  I have reverted back to
my whip or velium sword.
