You can.  You just get less XP.

Interacting socially is sometimes hard work, organising groups is hard 
work, making sure they work together can be hard work - the rewards is a 
faster kill rate and more XP.

Soloing = no external pressure = relaxed = lower reward
Grouping = external pressures = less relaxed = higher reward

Seems obvious to me.

Solo as much as you want, it is the easiest option, but don't expect to 
get as much XP as those of us who put in the effort to work with a group 
to achieve greater goals.
