AND, you likely won't. Decompiling is a lot of work for a simple parsing
program like this. Check the code and recompile if paranoia is your
middle name, otherwise run it through a Virus checker (with up to date
definitions) and that should be enough. Like I said, I have personally
used his software for many years, trust his work, but as Dark Tyger
mentioned, who knows me......... Take my recommendation for what little
it is worth.
