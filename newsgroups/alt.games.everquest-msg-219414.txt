I'm very disappointed that nobody suggested 'loadingpleasewait'. :p

I wouldn't read too much into it. Unlike druid bashing (which often
gets serious), ranger jokes are usually just that, jokes. ... some of
us have been picking on rangers since Kunark, why stop now? <g> 

Otoh, the fact that rangers seem to be the new "twink-of-the-month"
doesn't help matters. Those won't make it to 65 but it does raise the
idiot quotient for lower level rangers.  Even at the high end, there's
still some noobs out there, we actually had a lvl 65 Ranger in a LDoN
group a few weeks ago that seemed incapable of getting behind a mob or
turning off autoattack on enrage. 

Rgds, Frank
