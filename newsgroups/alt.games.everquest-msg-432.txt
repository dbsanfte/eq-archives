 I'm guessing it's to encourage grouping hence the poll they took at log in
a few days ago.  I said I solo all the time.   Which is a lie but I know I
could if I wanted to.  What are they doing by making the game harder?
Possibly forcing people to group so all the people that are leaving - for
reasons of hitting brick walls - will start getting groups.  These people
that don't get grouping are maybe not out going enough or don't understand
the mechanics of the game.

 Is it unreal to force people to group?  Most defiantly it is.  People are
not complete social people as it is.  For instance, when was the last time
you walked down the street and a perfect stranger came up to you and
said,"Hey: lets go to the gas station together and pump our gas."   "Would
you join me in going to the restaurant because that menu is rely tough for
me?"   lets face it, people just aren't social to that point in real life.

  It should be our choice to group.  So many groups have I been in where two
or three of the people in the group have their own personal agenda -
probably to sell on Ebay - and don't give a damn about the other players in
the group.  I purposely tend to solo a lot unless I have a trusted guild
mate with me.  Is this common place? Very much so. Especially in Uber
guilds, it's never trust them unless somebody knows them.

  Verant will be cutting back people if they increase the blue line.  The
blue line of cons is when you see blue - default color for cons minimal to
give you exp - in the how this creature feels about you/how this creature
will/won't kick your ass and the likely hood of it.  High school all over
again? You either get a clique going where people know and trust you or you
work your way in to a bigger one.  I have been on the servers since day one
and from reading web sites and trying to get in hunts I know it's next to
impossible some times to join the crowd.  Can't solo; can't get in the
crowd, what's the point of playing if you can't do anything?  All trades
take money and money is from killing things.  Platinum drops normally drop
around lvl 20.  Some classes can solo to 20 as the game stands now but will
they be able to after Verant pumps up the quota?

   Soloing special mobs for "QUICK" experience.  There are a few mobs with
in norrath and abound that you can solo and get unheard of experience.
People jump four maybe five levels in a day - latest lvl 45 I head was 3
days played - soloing these certain mobs.  They lack melee combat for it
most often but they are higher level for it.  I think it is these people
Verant is setting the standards by and they are not picking up on the fact
that these people will continue to level faster no matter how hard they make
it for the normal mobs.  I have seen Verant raise the bar on solo artist
three or four times and all it seems to do is make people leave the game
while older players continue to advance regardless because they have been
past that stage when it was easy and are now fully twinked.  Should they
start a new character, it's fully twinked and normally has a baby sitter
when ever it hunts.  Verant is putting up a brick wall of MOBS in front of
new players they can't beat down till they are high enough level to be of
use to main stream guilds and they can't beat it down with out higher level
help.  This is not to say nobody can but the common house wife, pen jockey,
working stiff slave will have a very hard time because they are not so
familiar with computer games.

blaa blaa blaa.  Verant and Mother knows best.
