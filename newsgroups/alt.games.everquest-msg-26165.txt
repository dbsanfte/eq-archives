Naw.  Actually one of our most frequent partners for hunting alternates back
and forth between his warrior and his druid (who's just my level, so that
works.) But he's also been not only guilded, but grouping, for his entire
druidic career. He freely admits that he wouldn't know how to quad kite
something to save his life.  That long running experience with him is, I
think, what makes such a stark contrast to my occasional run-ins with the
soloist druids.  Ok, generalizations generally suck <g>, but they tend to be
a very different breed.

If that were the case, then you would, IMO, most likely be in the wrong
guild.  I know that druids and wizzies in our guild certainly give more then
their fair share of free ports to guildmates, but it's never "expected". If
the porter is busy in a good group, then you find another port or you walk.
Simple as that. And as to bestowing outside the guild? If your guild starts
telling you that you can't give free sow's and ports to non-members, run...
don't walk .... out of there screaming.

As with all else, it's a game.  And if those things are of no interest to you
and you're still enjoying playing it, then nobody can criticize you.  I
apologize for assuming that you wanted to get your epic or visit the planes,
ToV, etc. simply because it seems the "majority" of players want to.  Doens't
make it wrong if you don't want to. My bad.

It was a good one, and definitely better phrased than mine.
