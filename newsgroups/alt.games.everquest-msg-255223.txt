What are all the ways to make spells cast faster?  My brother has a 65 
beastlord and his spells cast in half the time they should.  His slow and nuke 
are supposed to be 6 second casts but they only take 3.  I asked him what he 
had on him that made his spells cast faster and he didn't know.  I looked at 
his equipment and he doesn't have any spell haste gear.  Only item with an 
effect is an Obulous Death Shroud which has Mana Preservation on it.  That 
would make the mana used less not the cast time less.  So then I looked at AAs 
and he has about 36 spent points.  None that I could tell where spent on spell 
casting haste.  In fact I didn't see any AAs for a beastlord that would make 
spells cast faster.  Reason I'm asking is because I'd like to get my enchanter 
to cast faster as she approaches lvl 60.  The enchanter slow takes 6 seconds 
to cast and speeding that up would help a lot.
