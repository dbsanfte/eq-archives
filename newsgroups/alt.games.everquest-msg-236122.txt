WHAT a mess.
I have no problem with people who want to powerlevel, uber-twink,
4-box, whatever trips your trigger. But don't be an idiot and a jerk.
Being PL'd or whatever just makes being a dumbass twit even more
annoying.
The other day I was workin up my shammy in Kurn's when this lvl 8
warrior zones in, assures me that his gear is so ultra-uber that he
will be okay, proceeds to run around and aggro three or four skellies
while shouting, "heal me! heal me!" and guess what- he dies. After
zoning he never sends me a word- no tell no gsay, nothin. Umm, bye.
We prolly all have horror stories like that. New thread!
