Well, the reason EQ sucks so much CPU is that it's
constantly doing video frame recalculations and refreshes
as fast as possible to give you smooth-looking video.
Even if you're just sitting and nothing's moving in sight
(like roaming monsters, etc.), there are still *some
changes between frames, like the clouds moving, trees
swaying, etc.

So while you might be able to get away with having
some other process take up to about 20% of the CPU,
you'd never be able to free up a large portion of it,
because EQ is crunching bits *all* the time.
