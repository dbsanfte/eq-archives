    Well, let's look at the mobs I listed in Ssra. Cursed - AoE Charm. No
pets, duh. Creator - you fight him with adds right beside the area of the
fight. The aggro radius of a pet is sufficient to bring them all into the
fight. High Priest - again, nearby adds. Arch Lich WOULD be a no pets area
due to his relatively high damage AoE, but if the mage summons the pet
behind the altar at the back of the room it can melee from there and is
shielded from the AoE by the altar. Wouldn't be surprised if that was an
exploit of world geometry, but since the pet does low damage anyways it
doesn't seem terribly important.

    Each one of these mobs has a very good reason for being a "no pet" mob.
Either the pet is inefficient because it gets taken out by an AoE, or the
pet will bring adds. You see the same thing in another Luclin raid zone,
Akheva - using a pet on Itraer Vius will likely bring lots of adds to munch
on healers, if the pet dies against Shei then an add spawns, and the same is
true against the Insanity Crawler. So why use one?

    I notice it on Sprickett, my 34 mage. Her new Blaze spell has great
resists, but her old level 24 "Shock of" spell has mediocre resists and has
been resisted outright more than a few times. I've never seen the fire
spells resisted outright yet.

    Understand our typical raid layout. Everyone is shrunk to minimum size
except the pull team. Any mobs are, in essence, surrounded with the "melee
rainbow" formation. There is never enough room to back up a fair ways to get
a shot off, and many mobs are pinned against or in a single wall (not
cornered). These factors make bolts tough to use. There are some mobs where
there's enough room to back off and let fly, like Emperor in Ssra or Aten Ha
Ra, but it's not consistent.
