*sigh* I hate hearing stories like this.

For every idiot dr00d out there like the one(s) you are describing there are
10 druids who hate them even more than you do.

Sure, my druid kites...of course (though he prefers root/snare/dot/med now,
but even that takes running space).  But I can't think of even one DRUID in
the last 2 years (as opposed to dr00d) who would be so inconsiderate as the
one you're describing.  For that matter, I can't think of but one or two
dr00ds who are that blatantly inconsiderate...I think it's the same few that
just do it so constantly that everyone else starts really disliking a class
that has a hell of a lot of good things going for it.
