First off, there is no "amount of money you should have at level x". With my
first druid, I was happy that every time I reached a point where I would get
new spells, they were sitting in the bank ready for me. As long as I had
enough money for that, items were secondary. I'm not sure what kind of items
are available for necros questwise, but there is a feeling of satisfaction
you get from an item you earned or made yourself over stuff bought in the
bazaar, e.g. by the time he was 24, my druid had his warden of tunare neck
piece which was a very handy clicky root, and a testament of vanear, 10 wis
item. Nowhere near uber by todays standard's, but they felt good owning
them. My monk recently completed the eyepatch of plunder quest (20% clicky
haste) and the amulet of the grey (enduring breath).

Money breeds money. Look in the bazaar for items that sell regularly, for
example silver chitin handwraps or flowing black silk sash. Depending on
your server, the average price for an FBSS may be (say) 1800-2200pp. Spend
enough time in the bazaar, and you'll find someone wanting to shift one
quick, for say 1200-1500. So many people say it's obvious, but "buy low,
sell high" does work, you just need patience. In the FBSS example, you could
potentially make 1kpp just by turning around one item.

So how do you make the initial 1.2k to start the ball rolling? Personally, I
create a dark elf enchanter, get it to level 8, and run the stein of moggok
quest. I see these on Innoruuk selling for 500-750pp. Sorry, make that I see
people TRYING to sell them for 500-750pp. I sell mine for 250pp, and it's
almost guaranteed that if I leave one on my trader overnight, it sells.
Maybe to someone who buys it and puts it up for sale for 500, but good luck
to them. The quest only takes about an hour, especially now there's a boat
gnome in freeport for the OOT. In a week, you'll have 1k. You'll also have a
stein of moggok, which is a nice item anyway for a necro :-)

You can also hunt willowisps, and save the greater lightstones. Hand these
in to a gypsy in north karana, and she hands you a "concordance of
research", which you can sell to her neighbour for 9.5pp. The island in
Erud's crossing is usually empty, and has a reasonable spawn rate, although
at 18, you'll be keeping the island clear and waiting.

At your level, you should be able to handle the 3 spawn derv camp in north
ro, especially if you get yourself a temperance and some mage pet weapons.
These drop bronze items, which sell for 3-4pp.

At around 24, you can go to the ocean of tears, and visit the island with
gargoyles. Their eyes sell for 10pp, and stack. My monk made about 500pp
just doing 24-25 there.

Wooly mammoth tusks in everfrost sell for around 10pp also.

In your mid 30's, you can start hunting the guards in misty thicket. They
drop a spear every time that sells for 10pp

When you gain levels, mobs drop more plat and items that sell. Frontier
mountain giant fort is well known, my 30 beastlord solos there quite happily
(could have gone there earlier, I guess). Not much cash drops, but the items
sell to merchants for 12pp-40pp, and if you are lucky and get a forest loop,
285pp to a merchant or more in the bazaar.

The big money maker nowadays is farming silk from spiders & spiderlings. Get
a couple of stacks, sell them in the bazaar. These go for insane prices, so
price yours lower, and someone will snatch them up.

These are just a few areas where you can make money. I've personally found
that it's best to hunt them when you are getting XP from them - it makes the
kill much more satisfying :-) Bottom line is don't get fixated on how much
other people have. If you get your spells and equipment to a level where you
are comfortable killing mobs with little downtime, then your equipment is
fine. Put the money in the bank, and save for that one big item that will
really make your life easier - a horse, maybe or zlandicars heart.

The most I had on my druid, before he retired at 34, was 1.5kpp, and I spent
that on a springwood club. They now sell for around 200pp :-)

Since I restarted though, I've spent far too much time in the bazaar, buying
low, selling high. My monk is 54 and has 3.5k in the bank. He also has a
fungi, travellers boots and 3 leatherfoot haversacks - value around 100kpp.
The rest of his equipment is fairly cheap, maybe 15kpp.

I know, cheap is relative :-)

Bottom line is don't worry about what others have. If you are having fun
playing EQ, then you've won.
