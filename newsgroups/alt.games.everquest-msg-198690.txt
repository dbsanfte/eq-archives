Being from Vallon Zek rather than Tallon Zek server specific information in
this reply may be a bit skewed.

1. Frogloks ended up on the, get this, HUMAN, team : P

2. Thats the way that it started out on both Tallon and Vallon. Now it seems
to have almost degraded to a Guild vs Guild servers, as cross teaming is
rampant. One could argue that the total dominance of the Darkies ( dark team
that is )  in the beginning led to the formation of the 3 team guilds as
competition. Once THAT happened 4 team guilds were just a stones throw away.

3. Techinically you cant PvP until level 6. My personal experiences were
getting my little wood elve arse kicked ALL the time between level 6 and 14
by the shorties in G-Fay/Crushbone. Once I Get to 14 and started to widen my
areas of hunting random PvP became less frequent. Now at 55 PvP is usually
for xone control, although the random PvP'ing still happens.  Im not sure if
this really answers your question or not, and situations could be totally
different on Tallon.

4. *shrug* Shorty team is fine. I personally would never be on that team,
but thats just because I would feel DIRTY playing a peck ;)

5. Hmmm 3 Person PvP team. Beastlords are fearsome PvP'ers. All the best
tools for PvP, and on top of that they are amazing PvE characters. Shaman
are also excellent PvP'ers, as are Shadow Knights. My personal "best 3"
would be a Shaman, Beastlord, Shadow Knight team.  Of course those classes
arent all available to the short team. For a 3 Person short team Id probaly
go Shadow Knight, Druid, and maybe Ranger.

Hope this helps out some.
