Nope, just a cable modem with a crappy connection.  Still, even at max range
for Ward Undead (my preferred pulling spell for this event), I could still
see the ghouls clawing furriously at the air, our Graveyard Knights hacking
with their scythes.

Most, but I did have a few "yeah, what you gonna do about it" people.
