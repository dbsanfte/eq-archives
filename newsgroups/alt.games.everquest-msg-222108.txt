Yeah, I wan't thinking well when I made that assumption.

That formula (at least as far as Monks are concerned, and I think globally) 
is incorrect for 2 handers. 2 handed weapons get a sliding scale for damage 
bonus, with higher-delay weapons getting a better bonus.

Well, +atk has an effect, but I am not sure what, and I don't think anyone 
has exact formulae on that.

Haste will have the same effect on both weapons, being multiplicative in 
any DPS equation, and can safely be ignored(except of course with stuff 
like the Velium Swiftblade, in which case it obviously can only be in 
effect for one of the weapons)

Interesting... What are the stats on those two weapons?
