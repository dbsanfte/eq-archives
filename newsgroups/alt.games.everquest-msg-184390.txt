Maybe it's more like someone happening to be in the right place at the
right time? (like maybe if you had logged in an hour earlier when that
high level character happened to be in the zone handing out nice
stuff).  Plus, maybe that high-level player is "paying it forward" and
giving nice gear to another newbie that they once got themselves from
another high-level player when they were a newbie.  

Of course, if one really wants to be a "purist" and insist on not
using gear not appropriate for their level, they could always refuse
it.
