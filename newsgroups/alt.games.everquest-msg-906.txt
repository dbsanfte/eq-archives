You know, if I didn't read your ebay post first this might actually hold
some water with me...but it doesn't.

You powergamed.  You soloed the shit out of EQ and you have the ph4t l3wt to
prove it.

Quit EQ and quit your fucking lame-assed attempt to make it sound like you
can't solo if you're a necro.  That's not only a stupid thing to say, it's
an obvious lie.
