It would have helped if Vivendi hadn't been run by criminals.  See
http://www.cnn.com/2004/BUSINESS/06/22/vivendi.messier.ap/

The problem is large corporations gobbling up smaller companies and then
running them into the ground.  It happens over and over again.  Too bad for
the consumer and too bad for the computer game business.
