The EQ2 crew is largely EQ circa Luclin/PoP folks.  There are some of the 
older ones still around, but many of them did indeed move on to Sigil, 
which makes me curious about their game certainly.  At least, that is my 
understanding.

As far as SoE, no question, they just plain suck.

Whoever has been making the decisions on content for EQ is the person who 
has done the most to destroy the game however.  Mind you, I still play, 
but, as I said, it's due to friends made in game that still play as well, 
not due to the stellar content.  Also probably has a lot to do with still 
being at the level of going through PoP content for the most part as a 
guild right now.
