I've worked on systems that had multiple code updates each week that never
had downtime.  Never.  All it takes is testing, planning and hardware.

It happens all the time in transaction processing.  Software is rolled out
to one set of servers.  If bugs are detected routing is disabled and
redundant hardware running the previous version takes the volume.

No, but I have no idea what they spend on systems and testing.  The
frustrating thing about dealing with EQ and having worked in the credit card
world is I know what they're doing isn't that hard.  It shouldn't go down
this often unless they're cheaping out on hardware and testing or just
ignorant about how to administer a live system.

Customer satsifaction.  Competitive advantage.  It's hard for most customers
to commit to more than one MMORPG.

I quit playing before that happened.  They are better than they used to be.
I still remember the first week they went live and crashed their ISP.
