my shit stinks something fierce.  I just can't see how you can level to 52
and NOT know something about the other classes like only wis casters can
heal themselves.  Meaning Druids, Clerics, Shaman and to a lesser extent
RAngers, Paladins and Beastlords.  please don't tell me that you don't know
about casters realm.  where did you get your spell lists?  This isn't Ultima
Online where every caster can cast every spell and wear plate armor, or
Asheron's call where you pick a spell.  this is 3D Dungeons and Dragons.
classes are defined.

For the record, I do think it's great that you want to learn something about
your new class, I just find it difficult to believe that after the time
you've invested you don't know some of the basics.
