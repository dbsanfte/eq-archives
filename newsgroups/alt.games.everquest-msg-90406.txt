Found some stuff in Dawnshroud yesterday--cloud jewel of a large zelniak,
ancient fossil of an ancient zelniak, and mark of regeneration off of a
mighty zelniak.  Anyone know what these are for?  Also saw a "fiery" zelniak
killed by someone else and they said it had a mark of something or other.

Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.
