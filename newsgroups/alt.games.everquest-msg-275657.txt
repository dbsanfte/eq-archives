I don't pull wireless out of the air, but rather have a WAP in my
house connected to my cable modem.

I've used linksys hardware (initially "b" 4 years ago, upgraded to "g"
last year).

As a whole, it's fine.

Rarely I'll have problems with the card losing connection with the
WAP.

I have my mule box running 2 sessions while I'm not playing (one in
trader, one in buyer).  It's a wireless connection.
