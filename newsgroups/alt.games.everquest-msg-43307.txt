LOL reminds me of when I would return from a long night play session
of some RPG like Gamma World, Boot Hill, or D&D and my parents
would ask me "Did you win?" I'd just kind of look at them the same way
they looked at me when I asked if Santa Claus was real when I was a kid,
and smile and say "of course I always win." =)

Technically you never really 'win' any game. When one game is over
you just play a new one. The concept of RPGs are lost on many people
"Why do you play that game all the time if you can never win?"
"Gee, I don't know why do you go to the titty bar if you never get laid?"
