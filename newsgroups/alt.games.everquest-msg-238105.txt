A low ping is good, but not critical. really, a round trip difference
of 1/10 second is not that big of a deal in eq.

If you were using a software firewall, get a hardware one. dlink and
smc are both good. linksys is a little more hit and miss... there are
some firmware versions that are known to be problematic, but its
always been resolvable in my experience. (If you were using a hardware
firewall and that is what caused the problem, try a firmware update)

As to the virus...you'll probably want that on mostly, but with a
hardware firewall, it should be safe enough to turn it off while you
play eq.

Glad I could help.
