It has everything to do with KEI. 

KEI has so changed the game for casters that even equipment purchased
is changing. Before it was manna gear that a caster wanted, now its
Hitpoint and AC gear since Manna is no longer an issue till the 50s
and then a only a small one. Before the KEI explosion soloing casters
looked forward to long periods of downtime while regening manna.
Boring to solo so grouping was a nice break and indeed some would
never solo. Now of course downtimes are reduced so greatly that
grouping is COUNTER productive. 

His complaint was people not grouping, the issue of warrior soloing is
moot. I say give melee what casters have at least to the extent of
what I mentioned, downtime reduction. That or make KEI an hour long
buff to stop the KEI cancer. One has to wonder why this is allowed to
continue.
