when I was working on raw silk, I went here...and the silk that dropped was
amazing! anywhere from 4-8 silks per spider.

worked on studded leather armor to max it out, and then when it was time to
do cured silk, I went back to EK.
I was lucky if they dropped 2 silks at that point. I think someone at verant
caught onto this and changed it =(

or maybe I was just having a really unlucky night.
