I dunno about 3. I like top down guild leadership, not bottom up.
Dictatorships seem to be the way to go (assuming of course the
dictator is benevolent, thats why you pick a good guild). When the
guild gets to choose their leader, there seems to be a subconscious
(or maybe even conscious in some cases) feeling that the leader owes
his spot to the rabble... and that makes individual members of the
rabble more likely to dissent when things don't go their way - after
all, they PUT the leader on the throne!

With a leader who is not chosen, but simply forms the guild and then
invites who he or his officers believe are a good fit, the rabble
feels grateful to the leader, instead of thinking the leader should be
grateful to them.

Guilds are fascinating in a sociological way. If there's anything I'll
miss about EQ more than anything else, it will be guilds, their
politics, and their interactions with each other.
