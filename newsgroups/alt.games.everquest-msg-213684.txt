I was recent scribing my level 44 spells and readjusting my casting
lineup, when the thought occurred to me:  What would be the ultimate
spell lineup?  If one could pick any 8 spells out of the game to scribe,
and could never get any other spells ever again, which would be the best
eight to pick?

  I know there is no practical reason to it, but it was a fun mental
exercise.  I came up with this list.  I also made the assumption that
one would be able to cast any spell on oneself, regardless of level. 
Also assumed that I would have the needed casting skills to not fizzle
these all the time.  I know that I don't know that much about higher
level spells, or that are cast by most classes.  I know others might
come up with vastly different lineups.  I'm used to playing a support
character, and almost always duo or two box.  

1) Kei
A money maker, if nothing else, and very useful to give out to group
members.  And nice to have on yourself, as well.

2) Aegoism
Another useful one to give out, and cast on yourself. 

3) Reviviscence
96% Rez spell.  It's good never having to look for a rez.

4) Complete Heal
I had a hard time picking a heal.  CH is over healing in alot of cases,
and it is slow.  I cast celestial alot more than this one.  But.... 
when you need a big bad heal, this is very nice to have.  And with
always having KEI, the mana cast shouldn't be that big of an issue.

5) Snare
I thought of the darkness line, but this last a good long while, and
doesn't have a dot attached so it doesn't break Mez.

6) Mesmerization
Area effect mez spell.  This is a fairly low level spell, but I couldn't
find an upgrade for it.  But then, enchanters get about forty million
spells, so I might have missed it.  

7) Emissary of Thule
Necro Specter pet.  I've never seen on in action, but I _have_ seen
one,  and boy don't they look cool!  I would have to guess that this is
a pretty powerful pet too.

8) Feign Death
For when all else fails.

     I had to drop some spells that I assumed I would choose.  Most
noticeably, SoW.  But SoW potions are easy to get, as are mounts and
either J or T boots.  I also had to drop Port to PoK, which would be
really handy... but not as handy I feel as the spells I listed.  I also
regretted not having room for Invis, Endure Breath, haste, slow and
Lev.  But if I had just more spell gem, I would probably pick a powerful
nuke.  Ice comet?  I dunno, dunno much about higher level intel
casters.  I should imagine that since my  main is cleric, my list is a
bit skewed towards these spells (I listed 3 from that class).
 
So... what would your fantasy spell line up look like?
