Well, it *is* an amusing source of advice sometimes.  My Kunark book 
claims you can let people loot your corpse suggests standing at the gate 
of a city and offering to cast spells if you want "quick cash".

"For instance," it says, "Lay Hands for Paladins."

"Hi, this poison is killing me - can you heal me?" 
"Yup! Come back in one game day."

And, to be fair, it does tell you how to change your screen resolutions 
and several other preferences, near the back.
