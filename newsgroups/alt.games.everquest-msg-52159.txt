Most of the poisons out there are pretty wimpy at low levels, the
exception being Darkweed snakes.... which are great hunting as
a lowbie mage.  Water pet, rusty halberd, exp train par excellance,
and no competition for the spawns!

As a necro, you can also hunt them, if you are careful to keep em
feared and keep cure poison memmed... but its more likely to cost
you a pet.
