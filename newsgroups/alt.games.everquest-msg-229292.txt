With their slows and incredible pet heals, a BL can easily slow and pet-
tank tier 3 XP mobs, and gear/aa that helps them do that are high on my

HA3, AHA3 and IHIV very high, HG3 and AHG3 a lot lower because
letting a 5k (self buffed) pet get low enough for a crit on
Healing of Sorsha to not be wasted is a bad idea.
