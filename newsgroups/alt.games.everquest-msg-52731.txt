By comparing DAoC to EQ I made a comparison the most succesful game of this
particular subgenre' to date, excluding Lineage.  This game set a precident.
By citing that precident, you see, I can use subjective words like "better"
"worse" and most importantly "best".  DAoC has had the "best" release thus
far which far excedes the industry standard, young though it may be.

Your standard, obviously is substantially higher, and that's fine.  To each
his own.  Though I imagine that you'll be sorely disappointed when you
realize that there probably will never be such a thing as a completely bug
free release of a MMORPG.  Well, not on the PC platform anyway.  There may
be such a release on a console platform where hardware and software
configurations are standardized.  It's ironic though that you'd rather pay
to beta test DAoC and bitch about it than to play EQ which you state is "out
of beta".  Maybe you should wait until you feel the DAoC beta is over?

Anyway, good luck with your beta test.  Keep reporting those bugs and I hope
your perfect MMORPG launch happens soon.
