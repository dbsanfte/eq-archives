Actually I find the help in Photoshop to be pretty dismal... great for 
reference once you know the software usage basics (layers, selection, 
etc) and more importantly the lingo... but utterly dismal if your trying 
to figure something out from scratch.

Even the cut and paste example is non-trivial. There are many issues 
depending on the format of the picture, the selection mode, etc... does 
he want to crop the current image, or create a new image with the 
selected portion... etc etc.

My advice is to just open up the image in Paint and use that. Its been 
bundled with every copy of windows since version 3.0 and its more than 
up to the task... and hey its legal too (since I'm guessing your copy of 
photoshop isn't ;)
