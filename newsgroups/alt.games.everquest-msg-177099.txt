Kunark - catch the boat in Oasis or the shuttle boats at Butcherblock
docks

Vellious - catch boat in North Ro

Luclin - "port" up from any of the large wizard spires in Greater
Feydark, Toxxulia Forest, North Karana, Dreadlands on Kunark or
another in Vellious

Planes of Power - Use the book portals near every major starting city
and also at the nexus on Luclin

The luclin nexus spires and the Plane of Knowledge book teleports can
also be used to easily get around pretty much everywhere else.
