    Check his non-Heraldic slots to make sure Heraldic isn't better for him.
That would be relatively cheap to upgrade. Everything else he has is pretty
standard.

    Kill lots and lots and lots of XP mobs. Really. CA 3, CS 3, ND 3, AoE
Taunt, PE, and some of the PoP stuff will do more for his tanking than any
gear you could throw on him for 100 K.
