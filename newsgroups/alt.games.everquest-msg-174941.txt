Not quite...  You didn't get any xp for killing a pc mob.  You also
had NO control over what mob you were or where you would spawn, so it
was uselebss for powerlevelling.

They took it out because it was totally abused.   At the time, they
were trying to attract new players by making it EASIER to be a newbie,
and the "M Project" made it all but impossible at times with all the
griefers.
