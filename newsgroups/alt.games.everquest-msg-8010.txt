Hi All,

Does anyone else still get the 5 second freeze when your character 'saves'?

I have a Compaq Presario 600mz, 380MB RAM, Win2K Pro, Voodoo 5 ATG. No sound
card (just whatever's on the MB)

It's not critical enough to seriously affect gameplay (you generally don't
'save' during a battle). It's just annoying.

In any event, take care and have a great weekend! If you're on Erollisi Marr
my friends and I will be trying to wrest the fangs from Xalgoz (we tried
Wednesday - there were only 4 of us and we got spanked).
