As silly as this sounds - I've never seen a charm.  I've been playing EQ
well before Charms came out.  My main is a 51 warrior (okay, I'm a more
casual player who doesn't believe in PL'ing) and I routinely check in the
bazaar for charms whenever I'm there.

Am I too low to be seeing them as drops?  Have I just been very unlucky?
Are charms always NoDrop?

If not, where should I send my Warrior to find a charm that he can augment?
