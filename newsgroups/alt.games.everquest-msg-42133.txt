     I had a lot of this problem when I first started playing,
though only when zoning/gating and entering the game for the
first time.  There are two things to try:

1.  If your connection or computer are rather slow, you can
slow down the rate at which EQ tries to keep your client and
the server synched up.  There's a plain text file in your
top-level Everquest directory called "Datarate.txt" that holds
a single number in the range of 1.0 to 9.0.  If you're on a
56k modem or anything faster, edit this file and tweak that
number down to around 4.0 and see if anything improves.  If
you're on a 28k modem you'll need to set it even lower...I'd
suggest 2.0 at first.


2.  Adjust your virtual memory size.  This is a rather
advanced system-tweaking thing, but I needed to do it to
solve my problem.  Instead of letting Windows determine
your virtual memory size automatically, you may need to
manually set both the minimum and maximum size to the
same number.  A good guideline for this number is two
or three times the actual amount of RAM your computer has.
I initially had my machine set to give me a variable
amount, as needed, from 0 to 384 Megs of virtual memory
(I have 128M RAM).  I now have it set to exactly 256 Megs,
minimum and maximum...even though I have less total space,
the fact that the space is always there stops EQ from
disconnecting while it waits for my computer to enlarge
the virtual memory area up from 0 each time it runs.

     You get to the virtual memory controls through
the Control Panel->System (or is it System Profile?
One of those.) Start Menu item.
