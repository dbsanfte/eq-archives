 I was sitting in Befallen camping for the first key
waiting........waiting......and waiting.

 After waiting about a real 12 minutes or so I went to the fridge and got a
beer. I camp back and all of the sudden I get a tell.

"Kalessr tells you- You sorry &^%$#@ you just got my (*&$% friend killed
because of your stupid train moron"

 I replied , "Pardon me ?"

Kalessr says " Shut up stupid *&^%$ your getting reported cause that was a
loser thing to do"

I replied , "Hold on one second"
Then I got up, and re traced my path from the fridge, to my office. I didn't
see no ghouls, no skellies, no lurking SKs, and no dreadbones between my
fridge and my PC.

I politely sent a tell to Kalessr:
" Dude, you must have the wrong guy, I have been AFK for almost 10 minutes"

Kalessr replies, "It was you stupid, you just trained all those NPCs on me
and zoned"

I said " What color was my armor?"

Kalessr replies " Blue Fine plate, you don't even belong in befallen, you
tell my friend your sorry you piece of *&^%"

hmmmm
My armor is not blue, its Black and Crimson. This guy is on lvl 4, I am on
lvl 1. So I tell him;

"Look you sorry moth^%4 &^%$#$, you got the wrong guy dumb%$# get your facts
straight before you waste my time punk"

I never heard from him again.

Yea, I know  I should have just blocked the putz, but I tried real nice to
reason with him. What ever happened to a good ol' apology ?

Now, every time I sign on, I send him a tell that says:

" Hello Moron"

Will I eventually get in trouble for this ?
