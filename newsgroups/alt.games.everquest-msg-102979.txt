I never said the lawyers aren't to blame, if that's what you're
implying. People here are suggesting that she should be completely
forgiven for such damaging actions because of her grieving (better?).
That is, as someone else put it, horse#$%!. The implication is that
grief should forgive any irrational behavior... I guess that's why men
can get off scott free if they shoot their wife that they walked in on
with some other man. (Texas actually has, or once had, a "single
bullet" law. As long as only one shot was fired, it can be considered
a "crime of passion"...)
