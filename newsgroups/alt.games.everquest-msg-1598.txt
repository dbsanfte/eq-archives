Quick question with regard to buying spells. I couldn't find all my
level 1 and level 4 spells at the evil vendors in Freeport. For
example, they didn't have the level 1 pet spell. No biggie, just waited
for level 4. They don't have "Gate" either.. I'm assuming that this is
the same spell that other casting classes use - in other words, I don't
have to buy a Necro specific Gate spell, do I?  If the Gate spell is
sold only at the Cleric Guild in FP, I'll have to find someone to buy
it for me since I'm KOS there. No biggie. Will the same vendors always
have the same spells? Or does their selection change?  Travelling
around to get higher level spells shouldn't be a problem, but I'm leery
of going too far at such a tender age! :-)

Also, can I 'con' a guard to find out my status, without getting
killed?

BTW, there was a necro at the docks in Oasis with a spectre pet. Too
cool! 'Course scared the heck out of Jororie at first! :-)
