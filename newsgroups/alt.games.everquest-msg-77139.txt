Medicine Totem.

Fab spell, I love it.  It blinds the mob; gives you enough time to
fear them or ensnare them - whatever's your pleasure.  Doesn't work on
every mob, though.

I'm also a 24 dru and levelling pretty nicely in NK killing
griffennes.  I'm probably headed to EK shortly to fix my faction
problem with HPH guards.  

I understand South Karanas is pretty well regarded for our levels,
too.
