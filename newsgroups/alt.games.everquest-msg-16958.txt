What are you talking about? I dont think he ever said he logged? If you /q
while fighting a mob you will still die and loose exp if it kills you before
you are logged out.  He said pretty much his group was screwed and he gated
when he had a chance, so as to avoided the inevitable death that was going
to take out his group.
