Personally I think something is very amiss at the verant network end.
We know only what they tell us and have proven in the past their word
is worthless so makeup any explanation you wish. LD has been a problem
for broadband users for weeks now and Ive been able to trace the
problem, dropped packets, to what I think is verants network. Know for
a fact its not @home which they claim is the problem.
To be honest Ive about had enough. 2-3 LDs an hour is just not cutting
it.
