  Its all about what your wanting to spend IMHO. As far as speed, the
fastest AMD is on par with the fastest P4. More money obviously for
the P4 but my main concern is the Via chipset. I know some have stable
performance with Via but just from reading newsgroups like nvidia and
Asus shows a trend that Via may not be as stable as say a Intel 850
chipset. For me stability is first and speed second. The northwood
Intel P4 is coming soon and is suppose to be really fast.....will see.
