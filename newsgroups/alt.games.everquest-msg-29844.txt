How did you solo in FM? I tried engaging a giant at level 30, when he
was blue to me, and, well, I don't know how many hitpoints they have,
but it was more than my mana managed to make a significant dent on, and
the way Giants hit, it wasn't a question of porcupining him the rest of
the way.

OTOH, I've gone industrial on the Stein of Moggok quest, and managed to
make enough money to bring my WIS up to 170. I wonder if this would give
me enough mana to think of realistically engage blue-con giants.
