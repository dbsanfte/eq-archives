Hehe.  With a troll subject like that I'm surprised you even looked at
this.

OK, here's the deal:  I am a long time Asheron's Call player who has
quit AC and am thinking about EQ.  A few questions first.

What character should I play ?

In AC the warrior type player was severely limited unless he/she had
magic.  If I start EQ, I want a char that I can play solo with (and
level) but I don't want to screw myself when the char advances.  I
definitely don't want a char that ONLY does real well when in a group.
That's not to say I won't group, in fact I probably will a lot.

How important is character creation, and how should I handle that ?
(yes, i am a total newb)

In AC, the first few moments you spent on the char creation part would
make-or-break your charater.  Some times you could overcome those
choices later on in the game, but usually not.  I don't want to make
the same mistake if I take up EQ.  Help me out please.

Is there portal magic or do you have to run everywhere ?

Is the EQ community good and are there a lot of EQ web sites ?
Examples please.  A character creation web site would be nice.

How bad is leveling through the first ten or so levels ?  AC has some
really nice dungeons.  I hope EQ does too.  Are there maps, or at
least information, about the dungeons in EQ ?

That's about all for now.  Thanks in advance.
