MT has one of these and maybe that is where you got it who knows?  I
saw ilillil for the longest time in EC as I spend a LOT of time there
(122 days played on 32 Warrior=>) and it of course shows up as
Ilillil.  The auctions from her always said "Send tell to ILILLIL".
About a month ago I see the same person has one that is even longer,
same method.

And people give me crap about Kharlkuhlinayn=)
