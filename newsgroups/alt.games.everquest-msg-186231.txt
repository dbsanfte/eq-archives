There is only one wanderer, and if you time it right and have
reasonable damage output, you can take the bug near the end of its
path before he comes back, and then take the wanderer. No adds that
way. I spent three or four levels soloing there with my monk, so I
worked it all out nicely, except for when I got a glowing one.

However, if you have a group (of 3 or more, I'd guess) with a healer,
the fiends are a much better choice because you will quickly run out
of bugs. I could take most of the bugs solo with my monk at 14 or so,
and her twinkage was limited to Wu's and Polished Steel Ulaks.
