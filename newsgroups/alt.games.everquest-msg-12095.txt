If you are doing it for the tailoring don't destroy the higher quality
pelts, they drop much less often, so it will probably be quicker overall to
keep them until you reach a high enough level of skill to use them.
As for the studs it is probably easiest to make them yourself as the
blacksmith won't want to make them for anything near the price they cost to
make as they are so tedious.
Is it worth it, I don't know it will probably annoy the hell out of you at
times but you should be able to make a bit of money, and it gives you
something else to do every so often.
