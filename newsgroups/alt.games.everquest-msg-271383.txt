No. They could *NOT* have just gone with MP3. 

They were seeking to establish good relations and credibility with the 
recording industry as part of making iTunes succeed.

If they'd tried to build the iTunes store with mp3s. The recording 
industry would have never endorsed it, and without the backing of most 
of the major recording studios the iTunes store would have been doomed 
to fail.

capitalism as well.
