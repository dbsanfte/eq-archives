I was so bored with my Chars that I started a new one on the new 
european servers. I wanted to start without twinking and a new server 
seems to be the best for it, as there are not so many twinked chars 
around you.
With the "new" Newbie Armor Quests for nearly all race/class cobination 
you can have a lvl 10 Int caster with 160/170 Int without spending money 
into gear.
And hunting/Tradeskilling for money so you can get the next spells can 
be fun.

I must say, Nor Luclin/Velious Bosses or PoP zones are that fun, than 
starting all over with alot of knowledge about this game.

Trying to kill Emp Crush over and over until you are high enough to get 
him down is damn fun. =)

I would say, yes, start again, this game is still fun.
