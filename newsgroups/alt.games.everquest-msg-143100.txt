I recently returned to EQ after a long forced hiatus, and found that
the very small guild I had been in when I was forced off while in my
30s had progressed to one of the 'top' guilds on the server, a 55+
raiding guild with rather strict entry requirements that I don't even
come close to meeting. I know what you're thinking, and no, they
didn't kick me out. On the contrary, they have been giving me nice
hand me down gear in order to get caught up, and even some drop-only
spells that I won't grow into for another 20 levels, since I'm the
only one of my class in the guild. Everyone has been very nice to me,
both those that I knew from before, and faces I don't recognize. 

I was reading the server board, and I discovered in the rants section
that it seems that my guild has gotten a bit of a tarnished reputation
while I was gone, with several people saying they outright refused to
group with anyone in my guild. All the incidents seemed old, and while
insensative things that I wouldn't agree with were apparently said on
both sides, I know things can be twisted and blown out of proportion
in public forums. My dilemma is, should I go with my friends in the
guild, who have been very nice to me since I've gotten back, or leave
the guild due to how my guildtag might reflect on me? I would think
that I should go with my friends, who I have personal experience with,
over the words of some strangers on a server board, but I wanted to
ask some opinions, so I'd enjoy hearing everyone's thoughts.
