Looking at my song data from EQdiva, I see a grand total of three
charm songs.  The nice no mana cost one I got at 27 definately
has a hard cap as to target level (dunno what it is, but it was
very sad when I started hitting it)

In POD at around 50 I found mobs giving me the same message with
my 39 charm; there are mobs that are charmable there, but there
were at least a few which decidedly weren't at 50, I haven't
experimented enough to see which ones still are at 55; charming I
stick to the flies, even at 54 swamp rats were uncharmable still.

I don't see another charm till 64.  I'm shocked that A) pre POP
bards charm was limited to a 39 song, and B) even post POP this
key bard ability doesn't upgrade till nearly the top level, and
then only via the quite rare "get a spectral, then get lucky on
which song you get" method.

If there's a hard cap for the 39 charm, I'm in for a rocky road
to 64, with a substantial part of my functionality being stripped
away more and more as my target level climbs.

So in short, I'm wondering if anyone knows what the caps (or, I
hope, cap formulae) are for bard charm songs.
