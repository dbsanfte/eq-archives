I have the 56 spell Sedulous Subversion- 225 of my mana to give the
recipient 100 mana.

Or I can spend 325m and hit the mob for 320 (plus mage enhancers) and heal
myself, 310m and do a DOT that eventually does over 2k damage. I can spend
270 for a DD that does 520 points, but the mage bracer doesn't enhance, and
the mob turns into a skelly and everyone yells at me. I can't find the non-
skelly, more mana efficient versions of that.

I'll twitch when I'm full mana (rare, but happens during gaps), or during
the raid set up. But I'm not happy about sharing my mana any other time.
I'll help the mobs die faster by being myself, thank you. You can parse logs
to argue either role for necros... but I can tell you what makes ME feel
more useful and happy. Of course, one inevitably must take on whatever role
the raidleader declares or leave the raid, but if I ain't happy, I ain't
gonna want to keep playing with that raidleader. I finally found a role in
which I am comfy for raids, and enjoying them, and if forced into just
twitch-bitch, trust, me, everyone will hear me whine.
