My, what an intelligent and educated response.  Does your mommy know that
you're using her computer?  Sorry, I don't live in your hometown of
Iscrewmysis, Tenn...I spent the the majority of the 8 years of so called
peace (are you dillusional) under Clinton in the U.S. Army protecting the
right of inbred imbecils like you to close your eyes to the real world and
believe the nonsense that Clinton spoon fed you.  Peace under Clinton?  Give
me a break.  Ever heard of Bosnia, Serbia, Mogadishu, Somolia?  He had no
approvals to go in there, but he did, and it cost U.S. lives to protect his
ego.  I saw so many people leave the armed forces due to his blunders and
cutting of our funding.  Crawl back under your rock before your mommy comes
home from her pimp and catches you on her computer.
