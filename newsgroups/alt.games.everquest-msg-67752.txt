If you're getting a message about cannot find luclin files (like what started
happening to me last night), it tells you to go to the EQ website and go to the
luclin support area.

What I found is that if you move your Everquest directory from:

c:\program files\everquest

to:

c:\program files\SONY\everquest

It can correctly find the luclin files.

One of the files that patched Luclin apparently has a static directory path and
isn't smart enough to just use your existing directory.

You may also have more than one everquest directory, in which case you simply
move the luclin files into your existing everquest directory.
