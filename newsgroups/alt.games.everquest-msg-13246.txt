The quest will be useless for a soft skin, as will be the merchants.  I
agree though that the zone will still be better than FOB for him, and
generally find FOB irritating.

Hardest part will be finding groups, but second hardest part will
be running the FV gauntlet to get to the bank.

Running FOB to the bank will be even more annoying though!
