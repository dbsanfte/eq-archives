Where, exactly, have you taken sufficiently comprehensive
polls in order for you to speak of the "general opinion" on
this matter?

Suineko did a good job of figuring out what I was trying to
say, feel free to read his posts, it'll save me the trouble
of explaining it to you all over again.


>English not your first language, then?

Wow.  That's new and original, I'd never heard that one before.
My congratulations on your sparkling originality and creativity.

If you think that was a flame, you've led a very sheltered life.

It was simply my way of trying to rebut you.  The problem with
your speaking for the "general consensus" is that:

  1) it leaves the false impression that you actually know
     what it is, and

  2) it leaves anyone who wants to disagree in the awkward
     position of either trying to document a contrary "general
     consensus" to counter your assertion, and/or leaves them
     with looking like the lone voice of dissent against
     the hordes you assert agree with you on the matter.

My "don't presume to speak for others" wasn't a flame,
it was a pithy way of pointing out that despite a
rhetorical form which appears to be claiming that
"most" people consider the Armor of Ro quests to
be a waste of time, that's actually an overstatement
of the case and opinion is hardly so polarized as that.
You overgeneralized your position, and I was pointing that
out.

I have the same pet peeve with politicians who use the
phrase, "The American people want..."  when what they really
mean is "I want, and I'm going to try puff that up by
emptily claiming that most Americans are right behind me..."
