Except you should expect to pay a fee to a merchant for this service.  CF
offered a fairly good suggestion on how to do this with some loss (fee) at a
merchant.  Doesn't work well with all merchants.  BTW, as someone else
pointed out earlier in this thread, and I did in a different thread, same
person, same gripe, there is a merchant in LoIO so you can avoid FV
altogether.  There is also a merchant in OT that anyone can use.  The one in
OT sells food and water.
