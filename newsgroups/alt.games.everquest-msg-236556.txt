That's the single *stupidest* thing I've ever heard.  We had a raid
leader who arbitrarily banned pets once - once.  He just about lost
half of his regular raiding force that way.

We went on a pet strike and summoned no pets for 2 or 3 raids - the
results were interesting - Bosses still got walled and knocked off
platforms, and it was all pc controlled melee that did it.  And, 2nd,
we didn't have the DPS to finish mobs like the burrower parasite and
AL w/o the pets.

We did, however, have some specific rules.

1.  Against mobs with AE's, only casters with pet discipline were
allowed pets.

2.  Against mobs like Shei and Ocean Lord that spawn adds on a death,
no pets.

3.  You watch the push and reposition your pet to balance, just like
a melee would.

If you convince you RL to ban pets, expect your BL's, Mages and Necros
to take a hike sooner than later.
