VisionTek GeForce2 GTS 64MB at CDW for $190 isn't exactly what *I* would
call "a little more." ;p

CDW GeForce2MX 400 (64) about $85 at CDW...less than half the cost.   Though
I'm sure you can get a better deal on both cards elsewhere, I'm betting that
the percentage difference is going to be about the same.

CDW VisionTek Geforce3 XTasy 6564 64MB - $186.  Don't know if this is normal
but CDW doesn't have this in stock at the moment...shipping in 4-6 days.
The other two are Same Day.
