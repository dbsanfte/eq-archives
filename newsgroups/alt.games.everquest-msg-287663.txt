Funny, it actually made me start thinking about dps ratios and who
should get what.

I don't personally see a problem with having a dps class out-damage
another class by 50% or more, as long as there are some equal
drawbacks.

For instance, it's quite reasonable to assume a wizard, with one shot,
can nuke the ever-lovin bejeesus out of a mob while a monk could never
hope to match it in a single shot or even several.  *But* if that
wizard caught the attention of the mob, and he should, he gets the
skirt beaten right off him whereas the monk can take a few hits *and*
FD if needed.

I'd be cool with that....
