There certainly are roamers that can aggro the port-in room. If you are
unlucky and have sufficiently low level people on the raid they can also
aggro neighbouring houses which makes things lively.
I haven't been to Hate for a while but since the upper floor changes were
made a lot of see-invis roamers were added on the walls which made running
to camp spots a pain in the ass, as people would invariably die.
Fighting and clearing from the port-in house is the only way to do the lower
floor of Hate imho.
