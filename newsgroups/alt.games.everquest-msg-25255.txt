THis is the first of a long line of annoying waste of space spells:
a category known as PB AOE for "Point Blank Area Of Effect"

Basically it does damage to all mobs in close proximity to you.
This may sound like a great idea, but the line takes more mana
than your regular DD, and you need to hit more than two (more
more than three?) to do more damage per mana spent than
you would with your DD.  Further, all the mobs you hit are
now annoyed at you, and happen to be within striking distance
to show you their displeasure.

Normal strategy for dealing with mobs is to control things so that
your efforts are going into killing a single mob, who then stops
hitting anyone, rather than using sandpaper to gradually wear
down a whole group while they all work away at your party.
Therefore, you normally see mobs "parked" out of range with
Root, which would put them beyond the PB AOE range, or
Mezed by an enchanter so that they don't attack at all... tapping
them with your little AOE will wake them all up.

Much later you will get a couple useful spells in this line, the
Word of Health and Word of Healing, each of which are also
PB AOE... but heal party members in range.  Even these are
situational, since you need more than three injured parties
(more than four, perhaps?) sucking up the heal for it to be more
mana effecient than regular healing, and the relative amount of
heal on the first one isn't very impressive, won't save anyone's
bacon if there's trouble afoot.

I'm sure there is a way to use these spells effectively, actually,
but its not something I've ever worked out.  Damage production
is rarely the cleric's best use of mana anyway.
