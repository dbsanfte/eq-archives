Depends.
Against a dragon like Xygoz, all the mana in the world won't do you a
damn bit of good if you can't resist the silence.

Generally, as you get higher leveled, mana/hp/ac for casters mean less
and less.  AC is an absolute joke at higher levels since you won't be
tanking anything.  If you're a cleric and a dragon aggros you have
only three options:

1.  Pray your tank can taunt it off you (unlikely).
2.  Fire DA/DB and de-taunt it (possibly).
3.  Die (very likely).

At level 41, it's a good time to start the process of gathering resist
gears.  He's still at a level when a lot of the mobs that drop decent
resist gears are exp giving mobs.  Trust me, camping green shit for
resist gear is boring...REALLY boring.
