This was brought up before (couple of times) and someone, can't remember
who, Lance maybe, came up with a great theory.
Children. Everyone knows kids (I don't mean teenagers) play EQ too and if
you ever noticed (or even remember your own childhood) children will just
start playing with each other long before they actually start any sort of
conversation, so maybe they are just doing the same on EQ.
Of course they could also just be morons but I kinda liked the idea that
they were actually lacking in social graces because they were young rather
than ignorant.
