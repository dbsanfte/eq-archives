alt. groups *generally* do not have FAQs and are not required.

I understood FAQ stood for 'Frequently Asked Questions', inside the a.g.e
FAQ you'll find answers to some 'Frequently Asked Questions'. Seems pretty
straightforward to me.. obviously if you don't want to read it then you'll
killfile Taras' so you can't see it, which means it'll still help towards
some of the constant simple questions which get asked in this group.

Cheers,
