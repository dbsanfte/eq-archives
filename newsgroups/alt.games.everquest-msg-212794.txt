Umm, not really.  Yes its instant, but its also an Invis, which means that
attacking or casting spells breaks it.  The idea behind an insta click
isn't that the buff you are putting up overwrites something else, but
rather that you are putting up a buff that will be removed when you are
dispelled, thus saving the "good" buffs.  If you put up Invis to animals
and remove it immediately you don't have it up when the next dispell
lands.  Now if you aren't attacking and aren't casting any spells you can
make do with Invis... but why on earth are you there?

And I know, you are thinking "its insta cast, I'll put it back up when it
vanishes."  But you can't click it while casting another spell, so you are
going to be buffless during your full cast time at a minimum.  I don't know
about the melee angle, perhaps you can keep putting it back while meleeing
and maybe there's even some way not to screw it up while meleeing in the
first place... so if the OP is a warrior/rogue/monk maybe this is a useful
item.

A really cheap one that's commonly used until you can get something better
is the Spyglass, a gnome tinker that can usually be purchased for under
50pp, or most raiding guilds have an in house tinker who can provide them
at cost and tends to bring extras along on raids in case someone doesnt'
have something or forgot their clicky item.  The effect is annoying,
though, a zoom magnification that takes a little getting used to, and in a
heavy dispell environment popping from zoom to not and back constantly
during the fight will make you start saving for something better.

OP mentioned "especially indoors", but JBoots or (for shaman) Wolf Boots
are very nice insta click items to have, and the earlier dispelling fights
tend to be outdoor ones.
