I never heard of a minimum speed, except that the officer can use his
judgemement to say you were going at a speed that was too slow to be safe.
In California there is the "safe speed" rule that supersedes the posted
limits.  If the limit says 65 but it's foggy he can write you up going 50 if
he says it was unsafe.  He can also write you up going 30 in a 65 in good
weather if you are a danger.
