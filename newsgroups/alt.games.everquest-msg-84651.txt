Nowhere are they *required*, any more than a cleric is.  (Given enough 
druids and shaman, you can do a dragon raid without a cleric.)  I've 
never seen a Chardok Queen raid succeed without a Pally to pull though.  
Oh, and while not *required*, it's pretty much a given that they're needed 
anywhere someone needs to eat a DT.  :)
Actually, Paladins are pretty much required in any high-end raid against 
an AE caster, group them with the clerics, they use their group heals to 
keep clerics alive so clerics can be casting CH on the MA.  Plus Lay on 
Hands on the cleric 9 seconds into a CH has saved a raid more than once.
