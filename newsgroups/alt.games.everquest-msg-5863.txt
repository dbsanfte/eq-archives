Actually I partially did it :) If I had some better equipment, and, 
maybe another 9 levels, it could have gone better.
I have managed to clear every single militia guy in West Freeport, with 
exception of the two ube guards at the door, Lucan and his butt buddy
I have also managed to clear all the bouncers in Oggok, although I 
didn't go into any guilds. Was just waiting for a bind and bored :)
While waiting for a res in the same Oggok naked, I managed to still kill 
two bouncers :) Fun stuff, poppin back into Fear naked with a big mug in 
your hand
That was with a 51 monk and some bandaids
