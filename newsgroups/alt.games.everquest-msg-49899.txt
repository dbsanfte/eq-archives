Charisma makes no diff with fear either way. Verant stated what
charisma does, its for charming and npc prices. As you say its
basically like root, fear is based upon Magic res for the npc just as
it is for you (go and fight a known fearing mob with no Magic res,
then with very high magic res)

If charisma affected fear, my troll sk with 4 charisma from a set of
crustacean plate would fear one heck of a lot better at level 32 than
it does on blue cons  ;) I actually tested this and found no
difference in it fearing than my similar cleric of 37 with fear on
blue cons who has probably 70 charisma. 

As it is it fears no better or worse really  than my druid who can get
up to 121 charisma fears on animals blue to it at level 55 (except
druids good high level animal fear can last pretty long) Judging from
these 3 very different character types with different charismas, it it
totally based on MR and the MR of the mob (and level of mob vs level
of player)
