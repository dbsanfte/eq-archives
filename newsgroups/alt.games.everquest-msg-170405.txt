Having gotten my naked newbie little Ranjah past level five, to six
actually, I decided to stop by the trainers to get "Kick" trained up for
a point. I did so, and the trainer tells me I've learned the
fundamentals of kick. Ok, thanks a bunch. Back to the kobolds.

I get there and go to make a hotkey for it. It's not listed under my
choices of melee skills anywhere. WTF?

Ok, next time I'm full up on loot, I go back again and put a second
point into it. ("You've improved your skill in Kick. (2). Congrats.") Go
to make button. Not an option.

WTF? I've been making hot keys for a long time. Am I just missing
something obvious here?
