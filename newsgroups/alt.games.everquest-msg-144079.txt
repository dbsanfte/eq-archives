I'm sure several would dispute. (and I'm actually suprised that they haven't
done so already.)  but yes, I do believe so.

I'm level 60, and almost always main or secondary tank...  so while I have
some decent resist gear, I don't think I've ever actually worn it in battle.
HP and AC all the way.  My resists would almost be laughed at, somewhere
around 70 fire and cold unbuffed.  Yet I don't take any more AE damage than
anyone else on the raid.  I resist AE's as often as the next guy, and they
only rarely hit me for full.   The lower 50's people that try the same thing
get eaten alive.
