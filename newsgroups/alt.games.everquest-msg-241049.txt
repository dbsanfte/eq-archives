I am having the same problem.  I went and bought a new ATi graphics card,
installed the drivers on the disc and still get the same message: "no 3D
devices found"
I went to the EQ site, went to the download new drivers page, downloaded
them and still get the message.

Do you think I should un-install EQ and re-install it? (if I do, will I
loose my characters?)
This is pissing me off to no end.

Ben
P.S. on a side note in the thread about the Graveyard, I would need this if
I hadn't recovered my corpse Sunday, so in some cases it could be a good
thing to have.
