Yes, and most people will also know where to find the stuff they can't
"pick up"... To me, asking is something that should be done only after
you've failed to find the answer for yourself - putting in a
reasonable attempt. Kinda like the folks who'd walk up to me when I
worked grocery and ask where the bathrooms were....when I was standing
right under a sign over a door that says "restrooms"...
