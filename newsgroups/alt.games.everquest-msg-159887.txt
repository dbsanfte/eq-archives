According to Lucy it's always been outdoors.

History of changes for Fury of Air

Raw info for Fury of Air
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1439&source=Live

However, it's a Velious era spell, and we druids do get other stun/dd
spells, except for FoA (and it's new level 61 upgrade) all of the stun/dd
spells are outdoor only (Whirling Wind, Breath of Karana, etc)
