And thats where you are dead wrong, Boy Blunder...

No legal opinion has been rendered as to the time invested. And until
there is, the question remains open-ended...

WTF? I never said anyone supported Yantis' position ya schmuck...

I said that some of the finest legal minds were still debating whether
a tangible investment has been made in creating said character/plat. 
And the jury *is* still out on that...

Actually, it does....in many states you have certain guaranteed rights
that can not be taken away from you. Just because you click a EULA,
doesn't mean that Sony is guaranteed recourse in the event of a legal
dispute. But rights vary from state to state, so ya might wanna check
and see what implied rights you possess

Second, that particular section of the EULA isn't enforcible, if the
player/subscriber is found to have a vested material interest in the
time he has put in. 

EQ is still SoE's intellectual property but it loses a vast amount of
control it currently has, if indeed that were to happen.
