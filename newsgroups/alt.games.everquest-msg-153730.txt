Very very well said. I agree with everything you said.

Frankly for me the high level game as it stands now, sucks, and sucks badly.
For me this game is a joy to play up to about level 30 and then starts to
slowly bog down and start to not be fun, at 50+ it starts to become hellish.

Because of the design of the game and the difficulty of high level
encounters it becomes a chore. You 'must' have the required classes
and you 'must' use the correct technique i.e. MA tank and CH rotation.
No room for creativity, or spontaneity. It starts to become like accounting,
boring. Raids take upwards of 5+ HOURS to complete, and if you have
a wipe out even longer. I'm sorry but that is a ridiculous time commitment
for all at once. I play many hours at this game but the demands of real life
do not allow large blocks like that sorry.
