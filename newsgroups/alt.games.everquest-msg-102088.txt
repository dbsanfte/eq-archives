Well, ever since the last patch that broke the shuttles, stupid me decided
to take a trip to Erudin to hunt in the warrens.  I knew that the shuttles
from Butcherblock were broke, but didn't realize the one at Erudin was also,
until I tried to get back onto the boat a few levels later.

Normally, I would port out using the Nexus, but I did a format on my hard
drive, not thinking to install Luclin, and at the moment have no CD access
whatsoever, effectively leaving me stuck on this tiny continent.

Anyone have any ideas other than begging for a wizard or druid port?
