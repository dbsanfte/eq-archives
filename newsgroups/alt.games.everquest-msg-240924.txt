Meh, why have corpses to loot.

Go to GY zone, click on NPC, window opens with all your 'rotted' loot.  Its
not like you was gonna get a rez anyway.

Of course people could / would use this like extra bank space, but they can
do that anyway with multiple corpses, just a little less convienient.

Or even better and simpler, add a button to the normal bank 'rotted item's',
click and loot. Make sure you cannot access these items before the items on
the corpse have rotted.

Dumbing down? Not really, considering the one-way storage bank is already
possible.
