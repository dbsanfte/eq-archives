I have actually never encountered what you experienced.  It has always 
behaved in the way I described for me.  The only time I ever get summoned 
is if the mob is not rooted.  I know for a fact that I am at the top of 
the agro list, as the moment that root breaks, I am summoned, until root 
breaks, I am 100% safe, well, barring allowing my pet to die anyway.
