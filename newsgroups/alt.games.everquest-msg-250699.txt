But you're drifting off topic (which is fine: this is usenet :-).
The fact remains that having the wrong sky is NOT something to be
petitioned.  If it bothers you, use /bug to report it.

Closer to the original topic, I'll note that some zones are supposed
to be always dark or always light.  But those tend to be Luclin zones,
where you can't tell what time it is anyway.

For a while, after the DX9 fiascoXXXXXXupgrade, all of the zones had
the same sky.  It was pretty, but just plain wrong in many zones, as
zones that were supposed to have perpetual daylight sometimes had the
night sky, and dark zones sometimes saw sunlight.  I think they've
gradually been fixing those, but it still bothers me that the Luclin
nighttime zones show a moon in the sky, instead of showing Norrath
itself overhead.  I have screenshots of the old sky from Shadeweaver's,
and it looked a lot more impressive.  (And yes, I did /bug them about
it when it changed.  I should do it again, just to remind them.)
