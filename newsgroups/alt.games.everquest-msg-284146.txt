There's no reason not to be geared up for most any task you will
encounter.  That being said, spell gem count is a signifigant limfac.
OTOH, the only time I really feel spell gem limited is when
soloing(druid)  I can have a fairly substantial heal and dps load up
and feel comfortable switching roles should the cleric need an extended
afk or die or go LD.

If the content is consistently too hard for the group, then the group
is out of its depth, regardless.  Thats a hard fact for some people and
groups to swallow.  A really well geared tank, or a very intelligent
healer/cc team can make up for some of that, but some groups just
shouldn't be in RSS or MPG, or certain bad neighborhoods in DoN.

There are very few normal group situations that require a second full
healer that can't make do with a 3rd rate healer(ranger, bst, necro)
OTOH, a paladin in certain group situations will multiply group
effectiveness much more than other classes.  A group like Paladin,
necro, bst, mage, shaman, druid  will be able to handle a much wider
variety of content than war, cleric, enc, monk, rogue, ranger.  The
first group may have to work harder because every player has at least 2
roles, but they will have a much greater degree of flexibility in
tactics and target selection, they can also lose any one group member
and press on.  They may not be able to challenge tier 1 group content,
but they will do as well or even better on tier 2 group content.

 Clerics don't OT that much better than the other two priest classes,
yes, they have an easier time picking up raw AC, but they still have a
lower soft cap than "real tanks" which includes for this discussion
such things as rangers, monks and berserkers.  Its surprising how long
a druid can stand there and take the same kind of hits as a cleric.
