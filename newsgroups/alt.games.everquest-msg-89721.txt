What part of her rant was inaccurate?  If I were an EQ guide (I used to be
an AOL guide) I wouldn't quit over her rant...hell, she's telling the truth.
Why she was fired...who cares?  Is she a bad person?  Who cares?  Her rant
depicts valid points and feelings, and that's all that counts.

Feel free to attack the person if you want, though you gain no points.
Attack her opinions all you want...though you haven't yet.

I'm thinking that the ones who left didn't quite care about the players as
they cared about getting offended at bad language.
