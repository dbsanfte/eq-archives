Assuming there is a ROI (or is it an?), let's say 25 days to level to 50
(playing full time).  From what I've seen a 50 char will get about $300.00.
That works out to about $150 an hour.  Less than a waiter/waitress in a
diner and without the tips.  The ROI really sucks.  Even should you get to
60 in say 40 days and pull a cool $1000, it still sucks.  I'll keep my day
job.
