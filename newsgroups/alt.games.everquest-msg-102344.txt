Maybe the Morrison family should sue the manufacturer of the bathtub he was
in when he died to get a warning label put on it. Never mind the vices he
took with him into the bath tub (Figuratively, not literally.) It was all
the bathtubs fault.

Maybe anyone who has been hit by a car while crossing the street should sue
the DOT to get warning labels put on streets.

The possibilites are endless, really.

I wonder where she was as her son spiraled into addiction. Not because she
was his mother, not because it was her responsibility (He was an adult.),
but because she wants to blame someone/something else. If others who were
not _directly_ responsible for the addcition are fair game (IOW, anyone
other than him.) then she is too.

"Woolley knows her son had problems beyond EverQuest, and she tried to get
him help by contacting a mental health program and trying to get him to live
in a group home. A psychologist diagnosed him with depression and schizoid
personality disorder, symptoms of which include a lack of desire for social
relationships, little or no sex drive and a limited range of emotions in
social settings."

This is the most unbelievable part of it all. SHE SUMMARIZED THE REAL SOURCE
OF THE PROBLEM HERSELF.

Someone once in another thread said something similar to "You're the reason
peanuts have warning labels stating "May contain peanuts." on the
packaging." I have never seen an instance in which this humourous one liner
was more appropriate.
