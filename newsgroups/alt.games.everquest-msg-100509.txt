I hope and pray not, or at least if they do, they post a warning
first. My head still hurts from reading that...

If that was a joke post, my hat's off. If it's not a joke, I
don't know what to say... Although "good riddance" would be a
start.

It's funny, though, apparently the game became a pain in the ass
at the same time as the price increased. And I guess the programers
[sic] became money grubbing software writers wantabes[sic] the
instant the price incress[sic] was announced too.

Too bad he wrote 'sony' instead of 'verant'. I'd love to see how
he'd mangle *that*.
