I have been told that a Ancient Cyclops spawns in South Karana. I am
trying to do the J Boots quest and  I need ring from it. Does anyone
know where in SK and about what time it spawns. I know that it spawns
in Sourh Ro also, but if I can get it in SK that would be better,
since I gotta go to Rathe Mts. for part of the quest
