    I sense that all of the MMP games suffered from level inflation ---
where their senior customer base gets more and more powerful in-game, and
the company has to respond with high level stuff...

    In EQ, I started about when Velious was released. It was pretty obvious
that Kunark created a new continent for the Uppers. Even my pride and joy
Dwaven Warrior 30 has only been able to master the Sarnaks, but cannot
function in the Mountains or the Goblin mines ---

    Of course, Veliious is pure Upper class candy.

    Now, after a game driven 200 dollar hardware upgrade, I find that the
horses are going for 250,000 plats, and that besides running around in
shadow haven and the bazaar wondering if anyone is ever coming to sell, I
cannot get my new 16th level Ranger out of town because all the routes out
are, again Bright Red.....

    My small family of dwarfs on Tholuxe Paells, and my Ranger on FV, seem
to be doomed to languish behind some sort of demographic hump....My Warrior
30 swallowed his pride and honor and farmed the Warrens for weeks and added
up 500 plats, well short of the horse. Most of my other characters seem to
average about 3-4 plats per level in life savings......

    Either I am  part of a cohort of latecomers to a now over populated game
with limited opportunities for personal advancement. Or I am doing something
very wrong. Anyway, I can begin to image how I am going to live long enough
in RL to see my Ranger riding.....probably have to leave the account to my
grandchildren.

    Wadda ya all think?
