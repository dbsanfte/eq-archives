I put a "/pause 3" to help mitigate game lag (with bad lag, I may
increase the 3 to 5) as the "/loot" command may otherwise get executed
before the results of the "/tar a" command come back. Occasionally, I
still have to hit the hotkey again when target update comes back later
than the /loot.

Mostly the only time I click a target to loot it is if it is not "a
mob name".
