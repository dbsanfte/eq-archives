Looking at the first horse screenshot, I was like, "Damn that looks
good!" Then I saw the third (image 6) one, and the horses have some
serious proportion problems. Someone at Verant needs to go have a good
look at horse anatomy. Their heads are too small for their bodies, and
the front legs are just, well, wrong. The upper part of the leg is too
short in relationship to the lower part, and the legs look kind of
thick. You can see what I mean by comparing the SoL models to these
real model horses:
