Best reply ever :)

My answer is the same answer as anybody else has given - really, who
cares?  It's one silly sword, for one silly person, who won't be soloing
the elemental planes with or without it, so big deal.  And James, I need
to be attending the GM events you have - the ONLY rewards I've seen for
GM events have been complete and utter garbage - the cheapest of the
cheap jewelry that you can't even sell for 2 plat in the bazaar (and
this wasn't "way back when stuff was valuable" or anything, this was
recent), and - ooh, wait for it - sandwiches and fishing bait.  :p
