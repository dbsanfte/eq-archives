My cleric has all her fragments.

I'm going to do Ixiblat tomorrow evening. The raid force that's planing to
show up should be way, way more than enough. I don't have overking as yet
(next up on the list), but from the way I read the cleric epic, it seems to
me that I should be able to go ahead and do Rage while I have so many
already next to Skyfire. The main quesiton mark is whether the seal is no
rent or soemthing like that. The impure heart of Ragefire seems to befine -
it appears that I can just bank it.

My thought is to go ahead and down Rage while we're in the area, and then
only deal with the Overking in a week or two and the vendor Rage turnin to
be done. Comments? Concerns? Anyone know for sure whether it can or can not
be done this way?

Thanks!
