    Bard: none I know of. There are bard NPCs in game, but they get no songs
so they aren't really much like bards.
    Beastlord: none I know of.
    Ranger: the Berserkers in Swamp of No Hope.
    Paladin: froglok shin lord in Upper Guk.
    Shadow Knight: I know of no live frog shadow knights. There's many
undead ones, like the ones in Crypt in Sebilis.
    Cleric: froglok priest in Upper Guk is a cleric, isn't he?
    Druid: none I know of.
    Shaman: many, many frogs.
    Warrior: many, many frogs.
    Rogue: I know of no live frog rogues. What class is Slaythe in Misty
Thicket? The undead one is Assassin in Lower Guk.
    Monk: none I know of.
    Enchanter: Tolapumj in Sebilis, various Krups, the named in Upper Guk.
    Wizard: Gruplinort.
    Necromancer: froglok necromancer in Upper Guk.
    Magician: froglok summoner in Upper Guk.

    Yes, I had to list them out. ;-)
