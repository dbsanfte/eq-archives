Not all tanks... but if I have a rogue in group (which if not a tank,
is still one of the heaviest hitters in the group) then no question
that s/he is hasted.  I hit the proc'ers with dex, and the whole group
with group strength, and the heavy hitters with Furious Strength (no
mana - JBV) SoW is the same for me as you, with the group version.
Seldom have been asked for a STA buff, but will hit the main tank with
it for the extra hp's, as well as Tal of Altuna.  And I always end up
popping chloro from start to finish... keeps a cleric a little more
mana.

Not too much different.

Whatever works, works.  My style always evolves, and, hopefully gets
better.
