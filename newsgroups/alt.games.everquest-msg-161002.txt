Well you have the bard do slow/haste/crowd control, the warrior tank, the cleric
secondary tank and heals, and the druid DS and misc buffs (SOW!) plus more crowd
control (root) and... well the druid and bard frankly seem a bit reduntant, and
you are light on melee damage.

This looks like a really powerful quartet, with snare and slow and haste and two
and a half melee damage producers, and the pair of healers should offset the
lack of a cleric till your low 50s... at which point you'll have some trouble
till one of the healers gets Incomplete at 58.  If Incomplete was a level 50
spell you'd probably never miss the cleric

Neither paladin nor bard really make much of a backup healer, until high levels
where the paladin gets some serious group heals.  You still have
slow/haste/snare in your group, though, and decent burst damage from the
wizard.  Honestly, though, I think this is a weak combo you should only play if
you like a challenge.

Sadly, no, healing doesn't stack.  Mana songs stack, but none of the healing
ones do.

How about 4 druids?  Their DoT's stack now, and with mobs snared you don't
really have to worry about the lack of melee capability; just don't melee!
Where this grouping will break down is when you get to quad kiting; quadding
doesn't stack so well because mobs tend to break up and go after different
targets.  Once you level up some, though, for a change of pace you can each
charm a pet and buff them up (making sure they are snared) and play beastlord;
charmed mobs tend to make fantastic pets when they aren't breaking charm and
chewing you a new one.

How about 4 beastlords?  I did this some shortly after SoL release, and it was
great fun, (well, 6 man group really, but the theory is the same) you had 4
beastlords and 6 pets meleeing, one healing, one sitting and medding after his
turn at healer, and just rotated positions as needed.  Slow and haste and
stackable dots...

How about 3 beastlords and a druid?  Druid would be much better heals, a DS, and
snare, plus SOW much earlier in life, and the misc druid buffs stack well with
the various beastlord buffs (a shaman would largely annul the utility spells
from the beasty boys)

Necro, 3 rogues has alway struck me as a powerful combination, fear kite and the
best damage production in the game, necro over SK due to crowd control and light
healing to get past the results of fear breaks... but the trick would be for the
rogues to stand ready on Evade and dump aggro to the necro pet until fear is
re-established.  If you need to go toe to toe, sharing aggro between the rogues
and making sure the pet takes the brunt of the damage would be a plan, but
healing up the rogues afterwards might be a pain.

Classic teams would be warrior, cleric, enchanter, rogue; warrior, cleric,
enchanter, monk... don't overlook these, they really do work and are very
versatile.
