Speaking of the 50+ game, you know what REALLY bugs me?The fact that as PCs
we are all kind of born runts with our abilities capped so much lower than
most of the PCs.
One of the big appeals of a fantasy game for me is to gain sufficiently
through effort and patience a stage where you could challenge any similar
raced (at very least) and stand a chance of winning.
Point in fact -Ran Flamespinner from HH Keep.Ran is supposedly a Human
Wizard-thats what he teaches anyway. Ran fought a Lvl 60 Human Monk with
Celestial fists etc and a Lvl 59 Dwarven Cleric recently in my presence. He
tore them both apart (Monk then Cleric) without quite losing 20% of his
hps(He meleed them to death btw). It is disheartening to know that despite
being lvl 60 there will be NPCs around who make their living buying and
selling snake scales who would kill me as easily as I would kill a Sonic
Bat.
This is the big thing that sucks about the endgame IMHO. I liked the earlier
game because it felt more even.
