1 per tick up to 60.

At 65 the number most testers agree on is 3 per tick standing.

Meditation produces around 20 per tick for maxed skill

Remember, Magelo's formulas aren't perfect.  That's why they
have fudge numbers for AC and ATK, and why the number it reports
for my HP is 1 less than what I have in game.
