Nah, just equip the drum and play Selos.  If you're running twice as fast 
as the spiders, they can't do much to you.

Not really.  I've been running up the stream since Kunark was released.  I 
still haven't died there.

The problem is that the game has weird z-axis bugs, and most mobs can 
aggro you even if you're several hundred feet above them.  This is most 
noticable as a 51+ bard singing song of travel in DL, where the see-invis 
giants can whack you and have you fall to your death.  (Well, since bards 
have safe fall, we usually live, not so for the groupmates who get hit.)
