I think it shouldn't matter if they get you ahead in gear or
experience, and that doing something primarily to 'get ahead' makes
that thing less worthy of mention.

I'm not sure whether that's actual disagreement or just talking right
past you, so I'll leave it for you to decide.

Depends on how you define trivial.  I don't think doing things near
the edge of your abilities are either intrinsically worthy of mention
nor trivial;  those are the things that I believe should 'get you
ahead.'
