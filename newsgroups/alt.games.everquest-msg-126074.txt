/agree

And while we are on the subject of recommendations, the "His Dark 
Materials" trilogy by Phillip Pullman is simply wonderful. Anybody who was 
surprised after reading Harry Potter at how good "children's" books can be, 
will be absolutely floored by this. The books are "The Golden 
Compass"(Northern Lights in Europe), "The Subtle Knife" and "The Amber 
Spyglass".
