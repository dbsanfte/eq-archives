You can also lose quest items (or any other kind of item) by
handing an NPC a container which contains the item.  The NPC
will say, "I don't need this, you can have this back", and
give you the container back -- empty.

This is most likely to happen during quests where you get
a special container in which you are supposed to combine
certain ingredients in the container before you hand the
"packaged" container back to the NPC.  Forget to hit "Combine"
first, and... oopsie.
