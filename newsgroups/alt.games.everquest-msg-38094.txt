Is ISDN an option? I live well outside of the reach of ADSL and cable,
but was able to get ISDN service (after a 2 month install wait, anyway).

ISDN is pricy, but it's great for gaming. Latency between me and my
dialup server is about 40 ms. ISDN is symmetric unlike 56k modems.
EQ on two machines at once over it is no problem.

No way I'd go back to analog even considering the money it would save.
