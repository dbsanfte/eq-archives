So now instead of 1 person looting all the crap off a corpse (like the lame 
9gp-and-change items), everybody has to click on stuff to get it done?  
Sounds like a pain in the ass and a *huge* waste of time.

Furthermore, the server picking randomly who gets stuff is pretty much just 
like FFA looting.  Over time it's going to give a couple people an 
advantage.  The main advantage to having a main looter is that everything 
(except prized drops, which there may not be enough of to go around) is 
even over time, within a few of each type of coin.

So the existing loot whores always pick everything, and you're back to 
square one.

Personally, I like the flexibility that the existing system offers, as well 
as that it makes you actually put a certain amount of faith in your 
groupmates, and places at least some importance on a character's 
reputation.  Pretty much the only thing I'd ask for is the ability to limit 
the looters to 1 or 2 people (leader only or leader and leader-selected) to 
enforce a master looter setup.  And notification on successful pickpockets 
by the rogues, though I suppose that would remove some of the fun of it ;)
