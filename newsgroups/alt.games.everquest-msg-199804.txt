I realize I need a pile more flags, but is being keyed for PoTactics enough?
Do I need a flag instead to progress?  Reason I'm asking is somebody in
my guild was saying that if you are only keyed, you basically can't progress
any further.  It's not a big deal, I don't plan on ever being Elemental
flagged
in my lifetime, that's just out of my reach.  Just wondering, really.
