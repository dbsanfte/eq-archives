I appreciate the information if not the tone of delivery. This thread
was started, presumably, as humor. My posts were intended as humor as
well. Was I targeting Mages in my humor? Sure, why not? They're easy
targets. Mages are a poorly understood class by many � myself
included. If you took offense, I apologize.

I'm not going to pretend that I know all capabilities of every class -
my highest level character is, after all, only 36th level. I do know,
however, that any class, if played well, is a valuable asset to the
group. Mages included.

Could a Mages blow-up doll "happily kick the living shit" out of me?
Are we talking a 4th level Mage? I could take on an army of his pets.
A 60th level Mage? That pet could take on an army of me. Same level? I
could maybe win, but I'll put my money on the pet (I don't think he'd
do it happily, though. I'm pretty sure pets don't have emotions.) If
you add all the other crap a Mage could throw at me on top of that,
well, it's no contest. Warriors don't function well on their own. We
rely on the support of other classes as they, indeed, rely on us.

Could you have guessed my level? If I hadn't indicated in my post that
I was 36th, I find it unlikely that you would have picked that number.
You seem pretty knowledgeable, you probably could have narrowed it
down to a ten to fifteen level range or so. But an exact hit on your
first guess. Unlikely.

> When you leave the noob zones...

I can't wait to leave the "noob" zones. None of my friends play
Everquest (they're afraid to). I play at odd hours and there are
usually no members of my guild on when I'm on. So I'm stuck with the
pickup groups � the "noob" zones. I can't stand OT. God, what a grind.
I'm bringing up a Cleric (currently 23) and find myself drawn to the
same old zones for pickups. I can't stand it. If you can offer some
alternatives, for the love of God, please do.

I would like to make a distinction between "noob" zones and "noob"
players. Aleheart (the 36 Warrior) is my first, highest level, and
favorite character. I read no creation guides when I made him, so my
stats are all wrong. I spend most of my money on trade skills and have
no rich benefactor, so my equipment is mediocre at best � most of it
hand made or pried from the cold, dead fingers of mobs I've slain. I
often find myself in those "noob" zones (OT, for example) fighting
side by side with a fifth generation twink, geared to the gills with
Plate Mail of the Gods, dual wielding Insta-kill Longswords of Monster
Slaying (or whatever � double uber gear) who doesn't have the first
clue how to play his class. Melee's who break mezzes, casters who
constantly get aggro, healers who repeatedly nuke (not to say the
Clerics should never nuke � there's a time and place for everything).
Are they "noobs"? Or me. I play my class as well as or better than
others I've seen. I pull, I MA, I manage aggro for the group and
generally keep everyone alive � all at the same time. Give me a good
Cleric (or Shaman or Druid) and it doesn't matter how pathetically the
rest of the group plays their class. I'll make it work. Am I a "noob"?
Me, with the 36 Warrior and a head on my shoulders? Or the guy with a
server full of 50+ characters with his head up his ass? But I digress.
Sorry, I just get tired of being called a "noob". I'll be the first to
admit that I have plenty to learn, but learn I will.

This seems pretty likely. My respect for Shamen has really increased
over the last few levels. I don't know if it's because I never grouped
with good ones before or if they really start to shine in their 30s or
a combination. Maybe I just never took the time to appreciate them.
But I love having a Shaman in the group. They're everything you said.
Will I come to like them more than a Cleric? Only time and experience
will tell.

>
> There are a number of faults with the mage class... 

I'm sure the same can be said for all the classes. I think my Cleric
should be able to Bash. My Warrior should be able to bind wounds above
50% (I know I will eventually). I've got an Enchanter whose pet I
can't control.

It wasn't baseless babbling. It was humor. Or it was supposed to be.
Ordinarily, communication is comprised of many factors. Naturally the
words used, but in addition to that, there are tonal qualities, word
metering, hand gestures and facial expressions, posturing and other
forms of body language. Probably more. All but the words are lost when
text is the medium. Our brains are forced to fill in the rest. To
"make it up". There is a lot of opportunity for misinterpretation. I
think that's why there is so much "flaming" on usenet.

Anyways, I meant no offense to you or any other mage. Taking pot shots
at other classes in Everquest is quite common � and fun to boot. You
might even take it as a compliment. There is no reason to "roast" a
class that sucks. Druids for example. They've got a hard enough time
as it is and taking shots at them is just cruel. It's like making fun
of the crippled kid down the street.
