But it doesn't explain why it makes it so 54/55 Clerics can't get groups,
but leaves lower level Clerics able to get groups.  Your argument seems to
be assuming that the group needs to be all the same level.  If a 54 Druid or
Shaman is so much better than a 54 Cleric that 54 Clerics won't be able to
get groups, then neither will 48-53 Clerics (except in groups that are low
enough that a 54 Druid or Shaman would stop the group from getting XP).

That's what I don't understand your argument: the narrow level range you say
is affected.
