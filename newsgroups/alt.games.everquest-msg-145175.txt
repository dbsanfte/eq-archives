Talking about which, in the bazaar i was short of what i needed to buy an
item by a few hundred, and was running around trying to reply to requests
for ports fast enough to grab them (i assume others are faster typers or
know how to hotkey better than i do?), when request after request for kei
from various people was shooting past, with offers from 50-250 pp a shot ...
considering kei can enchance a group from what i can see, that means one
spell would have earned 600 pp.... and people say druids are money spinners!

Perhaps i am mistaken, but surely that's significant moolah, even for a lv
60?
