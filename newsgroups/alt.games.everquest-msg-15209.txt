NPC's of player races will "speak", and by that I mean, they'll react
verbally to Taunts and some pickpocket attempts.  Gnolls, orc, giants, etc,
usually only "speak" at the start and end of a fight, just as lots of
animal NPC's have some flavor text added to their initial attack.
Elementals for some reason seem to be in the "speaking" category just as
humans, elves, etc.  I don't know if anyone has bothered to make a list of
what creatures are in either category, but I can definitely say the only
time I see that exact phrase (I'll teach you to interfere with me, XXXXX)
is after I taunted them.
