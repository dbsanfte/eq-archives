You're thinking of bashing weapons.  Plate armour was worn only as
anti-missile protection, not anti-blade.  The helm was the thickest
metal, at a whopping 3mm (1/8 inch); chest, back, arms and legs were 2mm
thick; flexible parts, joints, boots and gauntlets were 1mm thick.  The
armour protected you from arrows by curves and angles (hopefully)
deflecting the arrows.  Any swordsman worth his training, with a
properly sharpened weapon, could easily slice through 1 or 2 mm of
metal.  The Battle of Rose field has seen knight corpses excavated which
were hewn through from shoulder to the bottom of the rib cage, plate
armour and all.
