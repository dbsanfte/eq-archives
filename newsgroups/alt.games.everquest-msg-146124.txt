	Yes, as a matter of fact I have:

	Summary: for a level 60 character, mobs below level FIFTY-SIX give less
experience than they used to.  'coz, anyone killing level 55 mobs at level 60
must be bottom-feeding scum and stuff, right? :-P

	The curve is going to look pretty much the same for everyone post-50.  The
mobs you will need to kill in order to get the experience you used to get will
be nearly raid-level for you.
