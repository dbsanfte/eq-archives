I stand corrected. A class that can always get into a good group will,
in my limited experience, still always level faster. I keep having
flashbacks to my pathetic wizard who could never get into a group and
managed to make lvl 24 after four months. Compared to my warrior, who
made 31 tonight with a liitle over 9 days played and a bit over a month
real time, that's peanuts.
  Of course, if you happen to be a class that will *most* of the time be
able to get into a group, but be perfectly able to solo on the occasions
that you can't, then it would seem the best of both worlds, no? Hence,
the druid becomes extremely "levelable" in that sense, to my way of
thinking. But you are correct. "Soloable" certainly does not equal
"levelable" in and of itself.
