Friend went to vexthal the other day, and he said it was the most
mind-numbing 2 days he'd ever encountered in EQ.  And he did PoF almost
every single day for 2.5 months one time to get his epic!!

We went for AoW this weekend with 40ish people (probably 10 of those were
bots, too - heck I had 3 chars there), like 2 warriors and 5 clerics, no
necros, not even sure if we had a bard there (pre-pop we'd have 5ish
warriors minimum, 10ish clerics, a mana factory for sure) I did honestly
thing we were gonna blow the trigger.

My wizzie never even went below 20m, couldn't sit the whole fight cuz aow
was trained on us behind w/funky agro resulting, virtually chain nuking,
tranq/epic for mana, and 2 shots on a mod rod

Im sure you were happy with the rewards!  But they sure did ruin the entire
kael encounter :(
I want my bestest fight in the whole game back, bastards!
