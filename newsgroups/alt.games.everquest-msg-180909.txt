I may have an answer for this... you say you back up to the wall....
well when my trader goes LD, I just log her back in, and click my
hotkey to turn trader on and click begin trading.  I dont look around
to see if someone has come up behind me etc... May be rude, but
Honestly I dont think about it... she is Always in the same spot,
unless when I log in somone is In front of me, and I move down a slot.
Soo, maybe they had all gone LD and the fact that your in the back by
the wall they never see you.

I have always wondered about the browsers.... never made sense to me.
Now I have on occasion been attempting to find a vendor and thought I
was clicking on them, but got somone inside/behind/next to them.

I dont think they can make you go LD by browsing you, but I may be
mistaken.  They may have  lag and their consol is not responding so
they keep clicking on you.

Only thing I can figure they have a Hotkey made, and I dont think its
possible to put a link in a hot key.

Never had this issue. Only issue I ever had was I was buying up
someones inventory because they were selling it Way under price... i.e
25 pp when it can be sold for 100 to 150 pp and they ended trader
after I bought about 4 of them.... and started to bitch me out for
raping the newbies...  then he said that does it YOU HAVE A PRICE WAR
ON YOUR HANDS.....  the wife and I still ROFL at this... our stuff
keeps selling just fine.
