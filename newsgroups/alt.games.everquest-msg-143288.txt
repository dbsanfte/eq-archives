IYHO what is the most profound change youve seen since starting EQ?
IMHO it has been soulbinders and the ability to loot the stuff off
your corpse quickly by right clicking on it. Ack! when dying in a bad
place it use to be so nervewracking to select each item and put it in
the bags. I was just certain some baddy was gonna come along while im
half nekked.
