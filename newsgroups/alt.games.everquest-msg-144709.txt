Netscrape 6 isn't too bad, once you fix it (this is similar to
getting your dog or cat "fixed").  The key is to succeed in
removing the "my sidebar" (or whatever they call it), which
involved several system lock-ups on each of the two machines
I've got it on (both Win2K) (I'm assuming that the developers
who did the work and their managers were all hired away from
Microsoft, no I'm not joking, there's some really shoddy and
untested crap in Netscrape 6).  Once you get it "fixed" it
runs well and is by nature immune to the mindless copycat
attacks on Exploder and Outhouse.

Sadly, many otherwise sane people due.  I blame the orbital
mind-control lasers.

Having sufferred thru getting Netscrape 6 to behave, I'll be
damned if I'll screw around with some other browser.  My
primary objective (avoid MS Internet Exploder) has already
been accomplished, motivation for further change is lacking.
