Chromodrac will dispell every single buff I have on, including any self cast
song buffs, and also including level 59 druid buff POTC (I did tell her not
to bother buffing me... druids just don't listen)

Why they wouldn't be able to remove a 39 song (charm) from my pet, if they
can remove other buffs so easily and frequently, is a mystery.
