Yep, the team from our server that went to ToT3 had 3 bards also.  They 
also had made it a point to kill the opposing bards first.  I got HT'd 2 
times in about 2 seconds, and was still able to last another 30 seconds.  
Had I been on a full team, rather than just the scrub squad.  (We were 
helping guild team practice and GM let us join since only 2 other guilds 
decided to field team.)
The thing is that a bard is almost impossible to kill in PvP, and not much 
easier in a duel, but they don't put out that much damage, really.  With 
the new long-lasting Selos a 50+ PvP bard should never die unless jumped 
deep in a dungeon.
I have found that I'm pretty much useless against someone with high 
resists though, I could barely outdo the fungi tunic regen while dueling a 
guild monk.  Of course he never laid a hand on me, which is sort of the 
point of being a bard.  (And the nice thing is that we CAN interrupt 
casters, if we can get their MR down, OOS and BBB are your dueling 
friends.)
