}Are there any good quests that a level 51 Ranger can do solo, with only 2-3

}or running around a zone waiting for a mob to appear on track. By good I

Basically, no.  Possibly the jboots quest or the Rallic Pack quest.  But 
mostly, if you're looking for profit, quests are not the way to do it.

}The only quest that interests me is the Ranger epic, but I need a guild for
}that, and the time to raid the specific mobs, so I have dicounted that for
}the time being.

Good quests at your level require help.  Dat's how it is.
