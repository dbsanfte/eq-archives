Ah, SACAIGAP, I see.   If you want to discuss it, then respond.  If you just
want to snip everything I say and repeat yourself, then we have little left
to discuss.

See Venture (DFH's) comments.   Here, I'll even paste them in.

"The ones who take the "easy path" (which still gets me killed every once in
a while, go figure) WON'T be able to continue to do so, and that means they
WILL bother him as they head into the previously-deserted areas he liked to
hunt in."

All of those people aren't going to suddenly decide to quit since they can't
monopolize D1 in Seb anymore.   They're going to be somewhere, which means
more competition in the places that I want to hunt (which give exp now, and
still will after the nerf.)  I've hunted in Seb with 20 in the zone, and
I've hunted in Seb with 66 in the zone.   Do I really need to tell you which
is a more enjoyable gaming experience?   (Hint, it's not the massivley
overcrowded one.)

How many hunting places can you name that have blue to 65 mobs, where the
new limit will top people out and they begin AAexping again?  (58 plus mobs)

All of the Deep (except the THO guards, who you do not exp off of) will be
green. Almost all of Akeva will be green, Umbral plains will be green, with
only the named being blue.  Everything on the first level of Ssra temple,
and everything except the 12? taskmasters on the basement floor will be
green. (possibly more, I haven't seen all of the zone) Chardok, with the
exception of the underboss camp will be green.   Sebilis will be completely
green, with only a few of the juggs blue.   Velks will be completely green.
Most of "New" Cazic Thule will be green.   Sirens Grotto will be completely
green.  Dragon Necropolis will be almost all green.  Hell, Plane of Hate
2'nd floor will be completely green.

Where exactly is everyone supposed to go to exp then?  Vex Thall?  Temple of
Veeshan?   The only feasible hunting will be in the few PoP areas designed
for 65 plus.   Do you really think theres going to be enough to hold all of
the over 60 players?   I don't.

Let me know when you've finished your Vex Thall key, Sleepers Tomb key, or
even your f'ing Veeshan's Peak key, and let me know if you still have the
same opinion on keyed zones.
