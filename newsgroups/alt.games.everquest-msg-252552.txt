The issue in this case is that the seller can't fulfill his part of
the bargain. As such, until they can give you a deed sanctioned by the
state of California you have no obligation to pay. But upon delivery
of a very valid deed, you are obligated to pay the funds in exchange
for it yes. The issue with the Gaming Open Market is that the seller
went through with the deal and turned over what was being sold, the
buyer received it and then pulled back the cash and refused to pay for
what they received.

Hence, fraud.
