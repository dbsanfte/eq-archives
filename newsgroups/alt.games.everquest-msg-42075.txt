It's in the high end game, post level 50 that necros aren't very popular.
The strengths of a necro is snare/fear and pet ! (plus damage dots etc)  In
outdoor fighting the fear kiting plus pet brings a lot to any group but they
do not need a group to use this so they mostly solo.

After level 50  you fight indoors 99% of the time and in dungeons you can't
fear kite efficiently because it would just pull other mobs so there is no
use for fear.  Pets are not very popular because when playing a long time
inside a dungeon the caster suddenly starts having less attention the pet
will break mezzes, cause trains etc.  Without a pet or fear a necromancer is
just a second rate wizard.

Most groups need a cleric to heal/rez, an enchanter to mez, when those two
spots are filled you want meleers/shamans/bards.  Because in the long run no
caster can keep up with melee damage _over_time_ since meleers dont have to
stop to med for mana.
