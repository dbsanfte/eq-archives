monk pulls mob, mob turns and kills monk.  second monk picks it up and runs
it down the hall.  second mob is stunned and killed.  third monk picks it
up, runs to the raid, just as the raid comes into focus he halts momentarily
due to video lag.. he dies.  monk 4 picks it up and gets it into the camp,
dies as the mob arrives

im not doing that, im not leading my monk team to do that bs.  pulling a mob
for a skilled player should NOT need an army of fucking monks to run it
every few inches (remember some of the mobs are faster than run3)
if i have the skill (or rather, know-how) to split tormy and all of his
guards alone, why the fuck should I need people along the way from his room
to the bank because I can't take a hit in my back.

currently if you get stunned on the pull you either need to abort it, get
healed and try again, otherwise your going to run out of HP before your at
camp.  this is monks with gear that far surpasses a guilds general gear
needed to tackle tormy
