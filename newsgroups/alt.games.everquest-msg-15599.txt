Pretty convenient, eh? They come up with this scheme to allow players
to move to another server for a price, and then they change the rules
in a way that will make a bunch of people want to move their
characters. And yes, I know it is tentative, and that we don't know
that they will charge or it, or that they won't allow a /movelog type
thing for players who want to leave the PvP because of the new rules.
But isn't it fun to suspect everyone of everything every once in a
while?
