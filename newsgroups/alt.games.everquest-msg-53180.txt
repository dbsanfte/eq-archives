There are several threads about this on www.eqtraders.com message boards.
Last time I checked the trivials for the 7th shawl were believed to be:

Pottery: 160-165
Fletching: 165-180
Brewing: 161-162
Jewelcraft: 170-180
Tailoring: 162-164

All the skills are fairly easy to get to this level except tailoring, which
is a complete pain in the neck. Note that there are conflicting reports of
Tailoring trivial levels for the 6th shawl, but the final combine is
believed to be trivial at some very high level (like 190). I did the combine
at 161 and got lucky. :)

Hopefully, the 8th and later shawls will not involve trade skills - the text
the NPCs give kind of implies this.
