I worry about this change.  The Bazaar will make the player market
more efficent.  This will drive prices down.  Imagine that you want to
sell a weapon.  You go to the Bazaar and discover that 3 other players
are offering the same weapon.  If you want to sell yours, you are
going to price it lower than any of the others.  Common tradeskill
produced items will soon sell for not much more than the cost of
production.  If every smith on the server sets up shop selling fine
plate and banded, they are going to have lots of competition.  Common
mob drops will sell for little more than what NPCs would offer because
there is no real cost to their "production".

Something needs to be done to fix the economic model in this game - it
really is doomed to implode.
