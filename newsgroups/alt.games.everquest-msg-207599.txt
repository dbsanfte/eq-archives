Lots of players run macros "attended". It is common among players with
disabilities, not to mention multi-boxers. Heck the built in UI allows
limited macro function. Unless you are doing something that is
blatanly an exploit, I don't see how you could be doing anything
wrongt. My understanding is that the spirit of the rule is to prevent
unattended macroing, which clearly is not your intent.
