And clerics, and paladins, both of whom now lull regularly.  I've been 
grouping regularly with a husband and wife warrior/cleric team in LDoN, 
with them using a spot and lull technique; first run we did we had two 
seperate "failed lull brings the room" incedents.  Afterwards while we 
were dissecting things (one reason I group with them a lot is that they 
do this "what can we do better" discussion)  I found that her charisma 
was only 95.  I suggested swapping in her shopping gear for lulling, 
even just carrying a opal stein (the ones you are talking about) to swap 
in for her shield should make a big difference... and it has.  I've only 
seen one more of those nasty lull messes... and she's rolling on the CHA 
augment drops now, plus keeping an eye on good cleric gear that has CHA.

I'm not sure she's not overdoing it, problem seems to be solved already, 
but at least this demonstrates a reason any luller would like some 
charisma... and the popular dwarf cleric or paladin starts with a really 
low one.  Lets see, then there's druids, who charm, mages, who charm, 
necromancers, who lull -and- charm (actually I rarely see them charm)

If it weren't for the fact that charisma is very easy to raise and seems 
to be relevant only up to around 120 or so I'd say you were in 
competition with half the players in the game!  As it stands, no, you'll 
probably only see bards and enchanters rolling for cha drops, just as 
Breathe says

I keep disagreeing with this even as I pursue it with most of my 
casters; the size of your pool doesn't really matter much for most 
purposes.  It matters when you go from FM to OOM in a single battle 
(could be multiple mobs, or just one, but whatever it was, you started 
full and ran all the way to empty).  If there was med time in between 
the battles, then you could have had enough to get back up to full, if 
you didn't then its as though you were running on a lower INT.  Pull at 
80%?  Then your vaunted 200 INT pool was only filled to the 160 INT 
level.  Pull at 50%?  Might as well only have 100 INT.

Since people will pull at partial fill, your actual int becomes 
irrelevant in determining how much mana is in your pool when each fight 
starts, its all a question of control, and of three things: mana regen, 
focus effects, and your own skill at selecting the most efficient spells 
to do the job with.

My shaman runs around with around 140 wisdom at level 52, and I don't 
think I've seen him in a situation where he wishes he had more wisdom 
more than three or four times.  Not to mention, with KEI this puts him 
at something close to 170 wisdom, and KEI is there about half the time 
once you get over level 45

Oddly I agree with you, except that I might put even more points into it 
at start.  INT isn't that hard to raise either, once you get it to 200 
the return on investment drops dramatically.  Most good caster gear has 
INT on it, but little has STR on it.  Very early in your carreer you'll 
be meleeing mobs, and STR will help there more than any other stat you 
can buy.  Later, you'll have lots of swap armor sets plus it would be 
nice to be able to loot some stuff without your butt dragging on the ground.

As a High Elf, I think you even have the potential to wear a full suit 
of cultural plate armor (perhaps its only chain).. WR bags aren't going 
to make anything you wear any lighter though.
