    Well, I think it is. Sorry but I do. Part of a cleric's job is buffing,
and part of buffing is casting symbols when needed, and not having the
components for your spells is a poor excuse for letting your group go
unbuffed. It would be nicer of a tank to provide the 'dots but I don't think
clerics have the right to expect it. Tanks have a lot of things they need to
spend money on too.
