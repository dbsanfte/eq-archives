No argument about the charm breaking, but the "too high to charm" doesn't
matter on PC level, Call of Karana (level 52 spell) caps at 53, only a 52
druid will have a lower charm cap, and I'll personally smack them for trying
to charm something yellow.

Cha has shown to be a mostly negligible tertiary stat as far as charming
goes, far more effect from MR debuff and relative levels.

Indeed, I get full 10 min duration charms on Mr. Snookums the Swamp Rat of
Pwn about 75-80% of the time at 60, whereas back at 57 when I started, I did
get gimp charms far more often.  (of course that 20-25% of gimp charm just
happens to include the 3 second charm while soloing a diseased malarian...)
