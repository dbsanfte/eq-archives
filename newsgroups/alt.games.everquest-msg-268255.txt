Nothing is terrific about it.  When 60 was the level cap and there was no xp
bonus for killing things within 5 levels of your character, it was insanely
overpowered.  When the cap went to 65 and you had to fight harder things to
get decent experience, it became a toy.  At least most PoP zones had specific
mobs for DC bait, that did about 2x the damage of a summoned pet.  With the
better pets post-65 and lack of DC bait in OoW, it is a near-useless
ability when facing modern content.

For an enchanter, it's still kinda handy in a few zones - charming a shaman
giant in Kael sometimes (rarely) lets you slow unslowable mobs, and there are
some zones with DC fodder better than a summoned pet.

For any other class, it's a complete waste.  It's not the only waste on the
list, though.  Once you have 500 points spent, you may run out of things
to buy, and get it for completeness.

Of course you knew it would be near-useless by asking other people, or
asking about it here, right?  

Fortunately, it's only 9AA, so no great harm.  At least you didn't spend 25AA
or more on some of the GoD abilities to find them useless.
