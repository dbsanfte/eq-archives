While I have no specific notes for these pieces, a good use for no rent 
armor and weaponry is to equip pets; pets can wear armor just like 
warriors, and benefit noticably from it in terms of reducing the damage 
they take from mobs.

Weapons are more questionable, the max damage done by your pet (and his 
average damage is based on this) is the higher of either his natural 
damage or twice the damage rating of the weapon he is weilding; usually 
this means his natural damage prevails.  However, for most classes, 
there is a range in which they will dual weild, getting more swings per 
minute, if and only if they have been given two weapons.  In this range, 
handing them two of any sort of weapon will up their DPS.

Hmm, looking at the list you give, it occurs to me that those items are 
magician summons, not the typical "no rent" gear that some mobs drop.

Further, few low level mobs drop a large number of items.

What has almost certainly happened is that someone has charmed the mob 
you killed, and given him a full set of summoned gear to improve his 
melee capability, either simply to grief the next person to find it, or 
more likely to use as an actual pet to kill other mobs with.  Buffed and 
geared, the typical mob is far more than a match for his comrades.

Normally a charmer will have the courtesy to kill his former pet rather 
than let it free back into the wild fully buffed and geared, but not 
always, some people are sloppy, and then there are people who've gone LD 
or died to consider.
