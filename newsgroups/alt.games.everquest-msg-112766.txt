NPCs that cast (or more often proc) a Lifetap spell now have the
'tapped HPs added to theirs whereas before it was just a DD, this was
a long standing bug affecting these NPCs and Necro pets which is now
fixed.

If the tank is Runed or is using certain discs (eg Weaponshield) then
VS doesn't get a chance to hit / proc his 'tap.
