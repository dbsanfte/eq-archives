Problem being, of course, that *getting* the right combination is damn
near impossible.  I'm okay with druids and shamans getting a better
heal if only because it means at higher levels, you no longer *need* a
cleric if you want to go get some exp.  Of course if all the druids
are going to sit around and cry about how PoP ruined them, I guess
we'll have to go ask the shamans for help.

So start a warrior, cleric, or enchanter.  Then you'll *always* get
invited places.  (Note: please refrain from laughing, warriors,
clerics, enchanters)
