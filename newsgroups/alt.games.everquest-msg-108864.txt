Anyone out there using EQ Legends?

I was checking out the website and it (EQ Legends) looks pretty nice, but a
bit expensive for me.  I wouldn't do it unless my wife (separate account)
did it too...  and my brother...  At $40.00 per upgrade to the "elite"
service is just too much.  My favorite would be a more dynamic world, but
the web integration is very nice also.  I'd like to hear from those who have
or at least tried the Legends service to see if it is as good as they
promote it to be.  Even so, I'm not likely to upgrade just because of the
price.
