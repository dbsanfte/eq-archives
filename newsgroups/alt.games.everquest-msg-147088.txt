Any time I used a particular one of my hotkeys I would drop to desktop.  It
happened every time.  Turns out my <character>.opt (or maybe .ini...I forget
now...but it's the hotkey file <g>) had a lot of garbage in it.  I removed
those lines and voila, problem solved.

The reason I brought this up at all is because MY hide & sneak buttons are
hotkeys...I tossed a Sense Heading (/doability 1) into both hotkeys to help
get that skill up.  If you've done something similar, it might be your
problem as well.

But first thing I'd do is change the name of all your <character>.opt and
.ini files and go into the game & let EQ rebuild the files for you.  Then
try sneak/hide.  If you have no problem, you've just narrowed down the
cause.
