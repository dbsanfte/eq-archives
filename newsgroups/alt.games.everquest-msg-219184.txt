I've only played a mage so I can only update that role. For the rest it
looks pretty ok though druids never really got behind all that much; they've
been adequate nukers from the start and with their evacs and sow they were
always welcome (try doing a dungeon crawl without evacs).

> Original EQ

Hot
Mages have always been damage dealers. In original EQ mages at level 49
became gods. Only necro pets came close to the shher tanking and damage
power of a lvl 49 fire pet. The sword of runes nerf and consequently the
pet-delay nerf hurt both necro's and mages but still no melee class was a
match for a pet.

> Kunark era

Not
Mages got hurt here. The 50+ pets scaled like crap and there was almost no
upgrade in nukepower (lvl 49 bolt did 800 dam, lvl 59 bolt did 1005, 25%
increase where other nukers got over 50%). The awesome firepets at level
1-49 became totally useless wastes of spellslots and solobility dropped
hard. Chian-pets as a solo tactic was developed in this era so mages still
could solo somewhat. Some turned to groups but the bad pathing in dungeons +
pet-aggro trains and the fact that almost no mages had grouping experience
up till then prevented much grouping.
Mage epic being by far the hardest epic of the lot didn't improve mage
morality either, though the pet once available was awesome and mages could
solo again as beasts like in the original EQ..

> Velious era

Not
The era that killed a lot of raiding mages. The AE's made pets useless on
raids and the high level mobs all had high resists so almost no nukes
landed. Mages became CoH bots, not being able to kill much because of
faction. Spell upgrades were non-existant. The new pet-buff was only an
upgrade in name, the effect was too small to notice. The 2 dots that were
given to mages had bad ratios at the levels they were given.

> Luclin era

Not
All-time low. Although the new AA pet hold gave raiding mages the ability to
use pets more effectively it's effect was dwarfed by the impact of the rods.
All raids were done with unlimited mana because of the rods, but every mage
hated his task. Many have left the class or even the game because of this.
No raid was complete without a couple of rod-mages but for the class itself
it was the worst period in it's existance. The rod-nerf made things a bit
better but the damage to the class was already done and for every 100
players there was only one mage left, at max.
After the rod-nerf things climbed back again, mostly because mages were the
2nd/3rd nukers in the game still and the luclin mobs had stupid high AC.
Extra nukage on meleebane-only mobs helped a lot too though the pets were
useless.
Small note here, luclin also finally gave mages a fixed-duration invis which
was cheered on by all.

> PoP era

Hot
The new pets were great. Although a lot of mages cried foul because the epic
was "made useless" the addition of new pets with high damage was a welcome
addition to the mage class. The enormous nukedamage upgrade was a surprise
but also very needed to give the class it's old spark back. Though the pets
became crap for tankage, mages became welcome groupmembers because of their
newfound dps.
The addition of a few AA's like Host of the Elements (minipets) and Pet
Suspend gave mages more versatility unheard of before.

> LDoN era?

Damn Hot
Mages rule the dungeons. In all dungeons the high sustained dps without much
loss because of no medding makes mages very well fitted for crawls. 1 of the
5 dungeons also consists mostly of summoned mobs and a mage can go all out
on CC, charmed pet and efficient nukes there. Pets have no problem sticking
to a mob like glue even when those are high up on a wall or surrounded by
barrels, which hurts PC-melee based dps a lot. Because the pet does half the
work and because of pet-canni mages don't have as much mana problems
compared to wizards or druids as nukerclass.

Necro's and Beastlords also are well fitted for dungeons, and their lack of
dps compared to a mage is often balanced by more utility.
