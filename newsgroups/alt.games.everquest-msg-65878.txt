I have faced mobs of that nature... I just think I've also faced mobs in
between that level and the string CHeal level.  What I'm suggesting
is that if the target is taking less than (# of clerics in chain)Khp every
10 seconds, chain casting DL might be a better way to go

Agreed, he's not... but if you had a 58 cleric as healer, then you
weren't getting chain CHealed, which supports my hypothesis.

As an aside, I ripped this out of a discussion in my high level but not
uber guild's discussion forum... so its aimed largely at people in
the 50s, but not top heavy 58+ only groupings.

One of the beauties of chain CHealing is that it can be accomplished
by clerics at 39+, although you won't often see that done...
