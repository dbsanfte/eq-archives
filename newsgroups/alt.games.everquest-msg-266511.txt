My information is a bit out of date, all of the friends I knew in our
local uber-guilds quit not long after GoD came out but on Bristlebane
there's one high end Guild that (at least until recently) would have
met your requirements. They don't (didn't) have any type weekly
attendence requirements, all they ask is that if you're online during
their raid times, you raid. ... which was enough of a restriction to
keep me from joining them but I'm not cut out to be a raider. 

'Club Fu' has been around forever and I saw them forming up in MPG
last night for a raid so they're still active in case you really do
want to consider a server switch. I don't think they're one of the top
two guilds on the server any more though. 

Personally, I think I'd just ride it out for the rest of the year and
see what develops. I don't think anyone knows at this point how WoW
and EQ2 will affect things so trying to make an informed decision at
this point is pretty much impossible. 

Rgds, Frank
