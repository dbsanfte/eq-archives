Hi All

You probably all know this, but the Treasure Hunt NPC's have some nice
festive items for sale if you right-click them.  There's a
Commemorative Coin with +50 Charisma (Lore, No-Drop, Range slot) and a
Festive Doll with +15 on all stats (Lore, Primary, Secondary and Range
slots) and they are totally free for the asking  :))
