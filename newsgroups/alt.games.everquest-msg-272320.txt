No one said they didn't exist.  I'm sure there are some
mobs which are trivial to a tank/healer/four DPS group
but tough for a tank/healer/four caster group -- and
vice versa.   I guess we'll have to disagree whether ANY
mob should REQUIRE a particular class -- unless that
mob is triggered by a quest for that class.

Well, it's a simplification.  Druids do NOT *heal* as
well as clerics, for instance.   But they also bring things
like damage shields to the group (for an increase in
DPS) clerics don't.   Shaman bring buffs and debuffs
with small heals and big wards.  And so on...

The point is a group depends on a *priest* -- and
changes their tactics based on which *type* of
priest they get.   A tank doesn't care he's not
getting damage, for instance, with a shaman as
priest or getting big heals from a cleric or getting
regen from a druid -- it's all good.

Rezzes were part of it.  The other was the overpowering
nature of CHeal.   There was simply no effective way for
other priests to compete with it.

I disagree they're generic -- there's a major difference in
getting regen vs a heal vs a ward.   That's even more true
when you bring in the "side" issues -- increased damage,
debuffs, HP/AC buffs, whatever -- each class brings to
a group.

Again, a lot depends on mobs your fighting.  A druid
might be *better* in some circumstances than other
priests (and the same is true of other classes.)  But
you don't REQUIRE the druid to succeed.

C'mon -- "tactical differences" are what make the game fun.
This isn't "hit attack and press the taunt button until the mob
is dead" warrior play....   Groups function differently based
on the member classes -- as it should be.  But they can also
all succeed -- again, as it should be.   I don't see the issue...
