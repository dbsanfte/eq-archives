I wouldnt mind it so much if it didnt involve rebooting and reconnecting
every time I hang zoning (GD?). If they are going to screw over my task
management, they could at least write robust software. Basically we all get
screwed because its an easy way for them to make hacking hard. Just like we
are screwed with netdeath over and over to stop cheating.

Unfortunately the alternatives arnt that great at the moment. Guess we all
just have to suck it up for now.
