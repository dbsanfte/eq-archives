Any 10 accounts.

Now, any chance I can talk you out of creating a guild?  I'm a guild
leader...it's a hell of a lot of work.

You have to be nice to everyone.
You have to be optimistic...you can never be publicly pessimistic
You have to be a diplomat to other guilds.  It's YOUR job to make friends
with other guilds.
You have to be there to either lead or assist on nearly every single raid or
hunt.
You have to set up a message board or email list.  You have to read these
multiple times EVERY DAY.
You often have to put aside your plans to help a guildy do something not
very important (in your opinion).
You have to set up a guild website.
You have to DESIGN the website (or talk someone else into doing it).
You have to maintain a guild list, including email address and class/level
info.

You can delegate some of this to others, but no matter what, YOU are
responsible for EVERY SINGLE THING that happens.  Every time a guildy is
rude to someone or violates TOS, that's a strike against YOU in people's
eyes.

Since I'm lucky and share GL duties with a couple people, and have a couple
great officers, I probably only spend 25% of my online time in my GL role.
It used to be 75% before we got into the swing of things.   OFFLINE I spend
about 2 hours a day on guild-related stuff (reading boards, reading friendly
guild boards, maintaining the roster), not including this newsgroup (which I
consider a requirement as well...YOU also have to pay attention to most of
every patch message so you can let your guildmates <none of whom ever read
the freakin' patch messages grrr> when some important change has occurred).
This newsgroup is about 30 minutes a day now, unless I write a book like I'm
doing now.

Don't expect gratitude.  Don't expect to feel appreciated.  DO expect to be
taken for granted sometimes.  If you really really want to be a guild
leader, one of the biggest things to remember is DON'T LET PEOPLE WALK ALL
OVER YOU.  Learn how to say "no."  If you play a druid, cleric, or enchanter
and like to go /anon, stop hiding...learn to say "no" to all those people
you're terrified will ask you for a buff, port, rez, or something.  Get
enough balls to do that and you should be well on your way to saying "no" to
your FRIENDS on occasion.

There's no way in hell I'd be a GL again.  My guild is running smoothly now,
and I'm in the swing of things, and I have great support, but that took over
6 months to happen (almost a year old now).
