This is a video game newsgroup.

It in no way is a reflection of the real world.  It is a make-believe place
where people from everywhere, but more notably, our United States of America
are able to exercise their right to free speech.  You also have the ability
to exercise your right to not read/reply to anyone for any reason.

My point is, there's no reason to take this all so seriously.  I'm sure that
if any of us were to actually meet, we'd laugh, talk, go out for a beer and
probably become decent friends.

I will concede that I have posted off-topic.  Is that <really> so bad?  I've
seen people here post off-topic on several occasions, but the fact that I
came to this forum, admittedly on an invitation from Avenger, but since,
have learned quite a bit about this community and the game, and have spent
my hard-earned money to purchase the software.  To the people who provided
that information, I thank you.

To make this long post short, take this forum for what it is.  If you
<really> get mad over what's written here, maybe you're not able to handle
this place.  I'd suggest something drab like alt.games.checkers or something
along those lines.

Have a great weekend.

Sword
