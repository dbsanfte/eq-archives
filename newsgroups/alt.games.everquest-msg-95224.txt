I find that the real newbies will not ask for charity. Either they don't think 
about it or they have better manners. Yesterday I logged on with the 4th level 
alt I created a couple weeks ago (a Ogre Shadow Knight) and there was a 1st 
level Ogre warrior there in Feerrott asking questions about how to setup his
skills and where the stuff he could kill were. So I grouped with him and bought
him a backpack because at the point that he really needed one he still couldn't
afford it. This guy was truly surprised that I was willing to spend my char's
money to buy him something.
