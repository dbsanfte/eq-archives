Not only is the movie an excellent little film, in my college "Good Books"
course, the novel was one of our assigned reading.  I'm what is considered
"Non Traditional" as far as students goes...  I was in my 30's when I
started college and was married with a child in grade school.  I was one of
the only people in the class that had seen the bloody film!  LOL!
