Wow, you got really lucky then, heh.   I can understand why the souffle made
you nervous though.

Now if only I could find even one egg...  so far 8 griffs dead no eggs, but
I can't get my tank ho back out to EW to beat on their tails for a while, he
got caught in the OT grind (all of 35 and up to 38 now in 3 days, yeesh) and
I haven't been on much. =/  (and its WAY easier with somebody to beat them
down while you just snare/fear, can do 4 or 5 on a bar of mana, as opposed
to 1/bar solo)

Then again I do have generally bad luck with the RNG... except when I just
type /random 100 out in the middle of no where and get a 97.
