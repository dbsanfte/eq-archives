Here's what he said: "Then there is the way grouped mobs work.  I've got a
quest to kill 40 gnolls.  If I go out and find a group of three gnolls,
engage them, kill two, and then decide that I am not going to be able to
beat the third, and run away--no XP and no quest credit for the two I've
killed."

But you said: "Killing a couple, looting their scalps, and running would
mean that the two scalps do count... I don't see how thats any different
than just killing them, running, and having them count would be.  Maybe I'm
missing what you are saying."

The problem is, and what Tim is saying, is that you *don't* get *any*
reward if you only kill 2 of the 3. And that's the problem. Whether they're
linked or not those 2 should count. They don't.

Scalps don't come into play (they're not even in the game - you get a
"token" when you've achieved a part of the quest) because there's nothing
to loot. At all. All you receive is a token. But in the above example you
would get absolutely *no* tokens for only killing 2 of the 3 gnolls.

It has nothing to do with groups except for the fact that if you engage a
group and not finish it *none* of that group counts. Sure the mobs might be
grouped but that doesn't make a difference to the quest. It's all about the
tokens.

That's what he (and I) would like to see done. If you kill 2 gnolls in a
group of 3 the two tokens should count toward your quest. As it stands now
unless you defeat the 3 gnolls you get *zero* tokens.

The text isn't the problem. It's a mechanics problem. See above.

You'd be surprised how little difference there is between spell and melee
"specials". And root and run won't work if you go far enough away you break
the encounter (granted it's a pretty far run but with a big group of mobs
it could happen). You can't use SOW to stay out of reach - there is *zero*
kiting. SOW goes off as soon as you enter combat (think Spirit of Cheetah).
I'll give you that there might be "tactics". But they really aren't worth
mentioning because of the "dumbing down" of the system.

Semantically speaking, yes HOs are tactics. You must pay attention. You
must break the chain if something area effect is up, you don't have a rogue
and you've got several mezzes. That about sums up the tactics of HOs.

It all depends on *how* you play it. Perceive it really.

You're right there. With some fun people in the group the chatting is

EQ2 is a bit different in this respect. From 1 to 10 there are four
classes. From 10 to 20 there are 12. After 20 there are 24. Look at it
closely and of those 24 classes you could knock it down to, say, 8 because
their abilities are so close. A crusader at 10 tanks just as guardian at
10. Or a crusader at 19 tanks as well as a guardian at 19. There (honestly
look at the skill sets) really isn't *that* much difference between the
beginning game set of 4 classes and the end set of 24 classes (within each
archetype). Sure the spells/specials might be different but they pretty
much do the same thing. It's not the same problems as EQ, but they're their
own problems right now.

I'll give you the LDoNs (forgot all about that one). The rest I still
maintain are for higher level raid-guild based content. I might be inclined
to grant a bit of LOY (I'm still leaning toward it targeted IMO to the
raiders).

Nope. And you won't. Some of those aren't what did it for me and some are.
The reason I left EQ2 were a bunch of little problems. I don't like some of
the things Tim mentioned and I do like some. There are some things he
didn't mention that I dislike (the complete loss of faction for example
(well not completely but do I really care if the gnolls dislike me and the
Far Seas Traders like me a bit more? From what I can see - no.)).

The biggest are the no buffing unless in your group. I think they could
have come up with a better level-based system. The other big one is the
instancing. I don't mind zoning. But the whole "Hey come to Ant2 and join"
is a problem for me. It really does break the immersion for me (I don't
know why). I don't like them telling me this is a "group" or "solo"
encounter. I'd like to find that out for myself thankyouverymuch. I don't
like the cookie cutter classes. A rogue is a rogue is a rogue (at least
until 20 but I'll never see it and frankly from looking at the
skills/spells there's not much difference to me). I don't like the "added
value" crap. Yeah I know I don't *need* to pay for it - but shouldn't Sony
try to please their customers and just give it to them? There's more but
you probably don't want to hear it <g>.
