This doesn't happen 100% of the time, but a vast majority of the time,
people show up without their armor on my screen (except for the dyed
slots), and what looks like a sword sticking through their heads (if
they're wearing a helmet). What's weird is that I have no problem
seeing Velious graphics on NPC models. When the PC re-equips his
armor, then I can see it fully. How do I fix this?

Thanks.
