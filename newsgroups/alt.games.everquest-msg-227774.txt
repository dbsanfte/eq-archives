Never having played a rogue, and just starting one, I am about to venture
into LDoN with him.  I have sense traps and disarm fairly high by tying them
to right and left arrow, but I am confused about what I need to do with the
chests.  I know that there are 3 basic types of traps: mechanical, magical
and cursed.  I assume I cannot even try a magical or cursed lock.  And, I
know that sense can sometimes set off a trap, which I found out when a rogue
in a group I was in sensed traps and set off the poison trap that wiped the
party (except me, I wasn't in the room).

I guess I just need a little more explanation about what I can/should
attempt.
