Which, of course, explains the wide-spread knowledge (and
use) of an exploit to avoid this trivial task, right?

Lots of people doing HoT or DN have problems getting
through there alone.  You don't need to be 60 to do either
of those areas and the seahorses are a bit of a pain even
then to casters who get hit and stunned, especially if it
happens in a bad spot.

But then again I was hunting/raiding in WW at 49 when SG
is anything but trivial.
