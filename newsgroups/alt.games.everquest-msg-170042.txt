I had this problem too. I disabled APM and changed my computer to 
Standard PC from ACPI in device manager. When my system came back up, it 
redetected all of my devices and assigned them their own IRQ rather than 
sharing them. It all cleared up after that.

I had a Matrox card in the past that would flake out when it had to 
share an IRQ. Seems that some Nvidia cards like to have their own IRQ too.
