   Well, looking at Google for this newsgroup using keywords "druid port
nerf" we can find some from about the time that PoP came out, for example
this
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&th=81e0e3f248366b78&rnum=22
thread and also
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&th=8c0b9f6d27296bcf&rnum=16
.  Not all of these threads are complaints about the "port nerf", some
people are arguing about the term, some druids say they enjoy not being
pestered for ports anymore, and there are other topics mixed in.  But sift,
and whining you can find.  I also seem to remember more of the same, and I
think to a greater degree, on some druid class boards.  Maybe someone who
read those forums more often than I did can confirm this.

    To my knowledge, the closest SoE has come to releasing this sort of
data would be "Fippy's Facts", the archives at which can be found at
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/fippy_facts_archive.jsp .  There
is some interesting stuff there, but they don't ever get into a percentage
by class breakdown.  Too bad, I agree with you, it would be pretty
interesting.  I seem to remember seeing some player generated breakdown
using /who all "criteria", but of course those were suspect since so many
druids and clerics, at the very least, go anon or role to avoid showing up
on those very lists.

    My personal gut feeling is that PoP decimated the druid population.  I
just remember seeing a heck of a lot more of them when I started playing
about 4 years ago.  And I remember there being a general feeling of dislike
for them.  Some of that might have been from simple class envy.  Having
ports, SoW, tracking, healing, nukes, buffs and DoTs in one package can be
incredibly useful.  But some of it was from the actions of the less noble
members of the druid community itself.  It was an easy class to play,
comparatively speaking, and one that was/is able to solo to a large degree
making the need for preserving a decent reputation in order to find groups
not as important as for some of the other classes.  Some members took this
as license to level up as quickly as possible, then give a big FU to other
players as they stomped through zones killstealing and whatnot.  Other
classes had their problem children as well, of course, but druids seemed to
have more, both in raw numbers and percentage wise.  Druids simply got a
bad reputation as a whole, though in reality most of them never did a thing
to deserve it.
