Eh, haste helps a bit, but for an enchanter I don't find that it makes 
-that- much difference.  Usually, the limiting factor is the recast times 
for our spells and how long it takes for the gem to refresh, and spell 
haste just doesn't help that. :)

It does help get the slow on sooner, though, and that's a good thing.  
On those rare occasions that I'm not accompanied by a shaman... :)
