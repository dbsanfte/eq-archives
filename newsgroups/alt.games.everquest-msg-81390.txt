Damn straight! And don't you puny walking smorgasbords forget it,
or we'll be forced to turn you into HEHE meat! OK, so that's an
ogre delicacy, but I've stolen the recipe for Carver Whatsit,
so you shouldn't feel safe...

Ain't no way I'd play an ogre, they are stupid, ugly beasts! Filthy,
too; check out the toes and ears on the next ogre you see, if you
really want to lose your lunch... But hey, if you don't give a damn
about race and just want the most efficient warrior possible number-
wise, yes, you should've started an ogre.

As for playing a gnoll warrior, yeah, you'd be different all right.
Don't see many of those around. Naw, I know you meant Gnome, but
you really don't see a lot of those either...

The regen gets useless pretty early, actually. Would you spend
6 minutes sitting on your ass regaining your health? Play another
race. 5 minutes? Play a troll. Not much saved...

Not right in front, gotta have that short run, shouting about your
mighty clan, come to take revenge on the vermin now infesting their
lands!

With that cool backflip! Yeah! Even better than the dwarven tuck-
and-roll! Of course, regular frogloks say Froooaaaak, but I can
see that the bards would, indeed, say croak much of the time
