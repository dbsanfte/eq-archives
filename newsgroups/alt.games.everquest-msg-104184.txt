Well you see Zeller it works like this...the extra $3 a month we're paying
goes to the GMs.  Periodically Verant is going to shut down all the servers,
like today, and pay the GMs to sit around and practice saying "I'd like to
help you, but I can't."  In Verant's view, this will greatly improve
gameplay mechanics.  :)
