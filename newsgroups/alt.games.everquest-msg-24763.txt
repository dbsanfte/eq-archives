You might as well go ahead and read them.  By the time it's over, you'll have
forgotten it all anyways, and you get to read it again.  Twice the
entertainment value for the same money. ; )

As for good books, at the moment my favorites are George R. R. Martin's _A
Song of Ice and Fire_ Series.  It's a six book series, of which the first
three have been released, so far.   Truly fascinating reading, with some of
the best characterizations I've seen.     I only have a few minor gripes with
the series, but compared to all the good things, they're pretty small.
Highly recommended.

A bit of warning though, it can get pretty grim in places.   If you're the
kind of person who likes the predictable clichï¿½d stories, where the heros and
all the main characters defeat insurmountable odds, while never giving the
reader cause to doubt thier success or survival, then this series is
definitely not for you.
