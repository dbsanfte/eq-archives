I'm talking about boss fights, and relatively difficult trash mob 
fights.  But I'm suggesting that given the current lack of discipline, 
that even on the lowliest level 1 trash, we should all follow procedure 
rather than making judgement calls as to what to wait for assist on and 
what not to bother with.

When I'm MT, with trash I call for assist very early on; I don't mind if 
my lock isn't all that tight, its probably not going to kill anyone if 
someone steals aggro from me.  If on the other hand I feel the mob 
-does- matter, I taunt, snare, taunt, DOT and I make sure (if I'm 
breaking a mez which is often the case) that at least one of those 
taunts was successful.  It doesn't take a genuine Boss to kill the CC if 
thats where the mob goes on mez break.
