Yup.  True newbies tend to find an area, and then stay there till things
green out, perhaps even staying while things are giving green XP.  Most of
us in this newsgroup, on the other hand, will be fighting the highest mobs
we can take without incuring too much downtime.  We'll leave an area that is
still blue, because we know another zone with higher blues, and the dangers
involved in the trip and how to avoid them.  We know what spells are the
important ones, so don't waste our money (assuming we haven't twinked with
enough money to buy all the spells) on things like "sense summoned" or "true
north".

Even with no in-game twinking at all, an experienced player will zoom up in
level compared to a true newbie.
