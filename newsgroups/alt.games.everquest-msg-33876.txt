I never have the patience to wait for day time to cross Kithicor, 
besides I usually have SOW on for the run and don't want to waste it 
sitting and waiting. I have run through Kithicor at night 3 or 4 times 
now, not once have I ever even been seen by a MOB, let alone get 
attacked.
The thing to do is to hug the side walls and the north wall. Go fairly 
high up on the wall once you zone in to Kith, then run north to the 
corner, east or west, then south to the zone corridor. You might fall a 
few times and drop a few hps, but that's it.
