Ok, this is not my idea, but once again, I can't remember who did suggest
it, but use Google for items like this instead of going directly to
Allakhazam to look them up.  If you want to narrow the search to ONLY items
found on Allakahazam type in "allakhazam" before the item you are searching
for.  This works much better than searching for an item from the lists on
the site and will give you info on things used in tradeskills too.

a google search of "allkhazam encryption key" gave me this result:
