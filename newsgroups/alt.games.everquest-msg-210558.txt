Hmm.  Ok, maybe someone's figured this out:  I've been spending mucho 
time in The Halls of Betrayal, since it may go away soon, and there's that 
lovely FT2 neck and the back piece of Improved Healing IV... There's a map 
available at maps.eq-toolbox.com, and I downloaded it and put it in the 
maps directory, but it doesn't show up in game.  I don't get the 'Mapping 
not available' message, just no map.  Or it's a blank map.  Or something.  
Anyone know why?  Is the downloaded file's filename wrong?  Did the map 
artist draw in lemon juice, and I need to hold it near a candle for the 
lines to show up?
