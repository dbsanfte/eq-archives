I think I agree.  The gear my 65 uber paladin friend gets off these really cool
raids has amazing stats.  He has 9000 plus hitpoints and says he has the *7th*
highest paladin HP / AC in his guild.
IIRC my ranger friend that regularly is MT said all his gear is Time Gear - or
something like that.
AND it makes me wonder if the *paper* tanks in our level 60+ groups are
*casual* players whose gear is *never* going to compare... there's seem to be
around 6k.  The average *casual* player is never going to be able to afford the
*great* armor that is sellable either.
There again, I'm never going to have the nerve to ask....
