Target your body.

Bring it so a safe spot near the cleric (doesn't have to be all
that near really, rez is a long range spell)

/tell cleric "I have my body targetted"

Now cleric can hit
/rt
/assist

and have your body targetted without having to search for it and
play click the pile trying to get it on target.

Many people target the cleric, so they can use /ttell on him, or
to /bow to him or something like that.

/ttell is convenient for you... but you just died and the cleric
is likely either busy (if you and a bunch of people died and he's
rezzing you as group or guild duty) or doing you a favor (if he's
not with your guild or group) and you need to make things easy
for him, not for you.

Bowing is cute and all, but finding your body easy is much cuter.
