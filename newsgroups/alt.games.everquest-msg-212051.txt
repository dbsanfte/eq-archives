Tell you a little trick when it comes to the taunt before waking move.
Turn off your auto attack on assist (don't remember the command right off
hand been a couple months since I last played and I'm a tad rusty) then
after you taunt /assist the mob. Repeat until the mob in question has you
targeted instead of the enchanter. You will not that at some point you wil
become their target. This reflects a successful taunt where you have moved
to the top of the hate list. You may notice that some times it only takes
once and others it takes multiple attempts. However it is still consistent
with what everyone here who have more experience playing the game than
yourself keep telling you.
When you pull the mob using taunt its because you get a successful taunt
that puts you at the top of the hate list (which was most likely empty in
the case your talking about pulling it through the wall)
Tell you what try your little trick on one of those mobs like so. Bag your
weapons and pull with taunt do not hit auto attack and just sit there
spamming your taunt key. Then let your cleric hit you with any spell and see
how fast the mob goes to beat him up til your taunt key refreshes.

Now I'm not trying to make you look stupid. The assumptions you're working
under aren't inconsistent with the evidence you see. However the alternative
that people are giving you is a better explanation that has been researched
and tested to death. People have been playing this game for 4-5 years now
and this stuff is well documented and tested. People have run the tests and
checked the data and the top plus one on a successful taunt has been shown
conclusively to be the most accurate answer to the phenomena.

Try this. repeat the experiment with the non attack hand fighting on some
trivial mob that can take a hit or two before dying. Do this partnered with
another taunt capable class. You taunt and keep taunting for several times
say 10 times for arguments sake. have the other guy stand there and do
nothing til you've complete the ten taunts. Then have your partner try to
pull agro off you with only taunt and see how many attempts it takes.

Now if you are right it should take at least 11 taunts to for him to
generate enough hate to get the mobs interest. If we're right you will find
that the mob shifts targets far faster more likely 1-3 taunts to pull agro.
