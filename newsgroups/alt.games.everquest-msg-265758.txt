Only if you accept the dungeon being occupied is a bad thing and the
party must leave to find an empty one. Instancing doesn't even give
the option.

This is quite possible without instancing. Your problem isn't that you
have to go there and kill, its that you want it NOW and EVERYONE
better get OUT of your WAY!

I'm sorry you can't get your beloved piece of loot the instant you
wanted it because another player got the named. As I said, moving
named spawns around so they can't be predicted solves this problem. In
that case, everyone has an equal chance of getting it first, within
reason.

And if you're talking about raid mobs, the influx is controlled to put
a clamp on mudflation, at least as best they can. Mudflation is much
worse for the game than any negative points from non-instancing. It's
okay to instance raids if its important to minimize outside impact for
reasons like lag or server stability. But not okay to do it just so
everyone can get their ubergear on the push of a button.

But if there were enough that there would be interactivity, not so
many that no one would ever see anyone else even if they wanted to....

Trying to force a mmorpg into a single group game without
interactivity is a fine goal except for the quaint fact that mmorpgs
SUCK as games. You could not pay me enough to play EQ without all the
other people in it, I'd be bored out of my fucking mind. Even if it
was a group or a guild together, without everyone else, it is both
boring and pointless.

You *have* to have the interactivity with these games. Diablo 2 is not
a mmorpg with a non-graphical version of Bazaar/PoK. It's the people
and interactivity that make it great.

It's a cesspool, but its an interactive cesspool. Cesspools have their
own charm and appeal.

Let us go back in time to original EQ's Unrest. That was a cesspool
and a half too. Every Faydwer resident and their dog went there.
Gnomes, dwarves, and all three kinds of elves. An occasional human or
brave dark elf. Groups had positions along the walls, or in the
courtyard. Sometimes one or two even braved sitting in an inside room.
Everyone pulled what they could from inside. I'm talking before the
time it became ultra crowded, of course - a problem with EQ's massive
lack of content in its original form, not with non-instancing. And
trains, trains, and more trains. Train busting. Groups training other
groups. Groups helping trained groups. People helping other people.
People talking, fighting, yelling, training, healing, *interacting*.
That was EQ at its *best*. Now if Unrest had been instanced? A single
group, doing its boring pulls with no threat of surprise or anything.
Don't tell me about crawling. Crawling is just moving your camp spot
every few minutes to allow the puller a shorter pull.

It was Unrest that addicted me so badly back in early spring 1999.
Would I have become addicted if Unrest had been instanced? No chance
in hell. Sitting in... probably BB, waiting for a group to form up and
run there? Nice and safe in my graphical chat lobby until I found
people to go to a pocket dimension with and do predictable things over
and over? Screw that. I'll take the chaos anyday.

I find it is the people variable that makes the game interesting.
Without the interactivity, the game will be as boring as LDoN.

Sounds like you want to force your vision on everyone else then, since
your vision is not compatible with how EQ or other non-instancing
games work. I hope a game comes out that caters to that style of
gameplay for you, I really do, because that would mean another game
could focus away from it, giving me a game *I'd* want to play.

That is your right. I do see it with worldy eyes, though, which means
I don't think mobs should be there just because someone wants to kill
them for their loot.
