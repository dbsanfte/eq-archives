You say that as if the two are mutually exclusive.  She's saying that the 
best developmental approach or young children is to let them feel valued, 
and the best educational approach is to encourage questions and give them 
answers to their questions.  Those answers will be tailored to be as much 
of an answer as the parent feels he or she can handle.

And no one is suggesting otherwise.  However, even a 2 yr old can 
comprehend the intricacies of AIDS and HIV wihout all its excess baggage.

No, you don't need a muppet to explain how to read and write, either.  But 
my experience suggests that muppets can be very helpful in this regard.

No, it stands for Everquest.  Sheesh.  Don't even know what your own 
moniker stands for.
