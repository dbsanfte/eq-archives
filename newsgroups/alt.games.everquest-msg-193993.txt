    Those are some nice changes. The food vendor in the newbie yard in
Butcherblock lost his food when the tradeskill supplies were expanded there,
so good to see it's back. Although the clever new player will notice that
you can eat Snake Eggs....

    Yay!

    I think it's too late. Players have moved beyond Acrylia, or there's
better RvR options for people who aren't at that stage yet. I hope it works
now - it supposedly was one of the neatest places in game. But I'm not going
to get my hopes up, especially considering....

    So they have no clue yet how to make this key useful, but made sure to
destroy the value it once had. That's really, really disappointing. I doubt
the one guild that really advanced far into the zone (Ring of Valor) will
ever be rewarded adequately for the time they poured into that hole of a
zone.

    Should be interesting to see if any of the old "safe spots" that still
existed are finally gone. I'm hopeful.

    Stuff like this always makes me wonder. Should I congratulate the other
guilds on our server trying Xegony now, as it's likely been gimped by
accident, or should I wait until they kill her?

> - Protectors of Growth now actually protect the Plane of Growth again.
Beware.

    Heh, that's too bad. With the PoGs disabled, the zone was actually
seeing some use. The gem drop rate is pretty nice, some still-saleable
spells drop along with a few nifty items, and you can always bring up a
non-KOS twink of the correct level to loot armour. Now, it'll go back to
being a wasteland. The RvR is better in Kael, the quest armour is the same
quality as PoG, and there's no longer any crowding in Kael, so why would
people raid PoG?

    Congrats me on one more bank space. And for the record, yes, I could
swing it and kill things with it when I equipped it.

> - Pets no longer attack Tylis Newleaf when he teleports your group.

    They actually changed a few teleports from Detrimental to Beneficial,
not just the Tylis one. Guess Monual's guild wasn't the only one hosed by
this!

> - Increased the drop rate on some quest items in Hate's Fury.

    So now the boss can actually be spawned more than once in a blue moon?
The zone might see more than sporadic use now!

    Hahaha! I guess the pointed comments by some message board regulars
about "padding the patch message with useless spelling and door fixes" made
an impression.
