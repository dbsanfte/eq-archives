Burrower (imo) is more like the Idol than the AoW (which isn't really a huge
difference i guess.. slowable, way more hp, similar hits, but no flurry
etc).. what wave did you guys get to on your first couple of burrower tries?

Sontalaks a waste of manaburn :(   A prime example of risk versus reward

I bet 8 people could prolly drop Innoruk (assuming he slows without a
problem).. Velk - hmm i dunno, its been soo long since we killed him.  We
didn't see much point anymore, when the encounter felt similar to a Tormax
guard fight..

I've tanked Rhag 1 for a lil while, he would probably be bottom of my list..
Inny is a gimp, but I've only fought him once

Anyway how do you truly rank a fight?  I mean.. Dain is probably a lot
"tougher" than Vindi, but I never see anybody wipe on Dain... i see guilds
wipe on Vindi if they don't have their shit about them on the pull.

We've flawless killed Tormax and Statue, and wiped on Vindi in the same
night before... last thursday, a guild who was "camping" Tormax, pulled
vindi and wiped 3 times.. then dropped him flawlessly heh.. go figure
