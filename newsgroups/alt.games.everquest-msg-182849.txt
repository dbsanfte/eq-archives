I've wondered about that myself. Of course it sounds horrific since we
"grew up" playing EQ, but if it was a totally different game and it was
what you were used to, I could envision it working.

One concept might be some sort of "experience credit" after you died.
Perhaps a situtation where your next character would be given "credit"
for levels, skills and experience already attained. Something like, if
you die at level forty, your next character can start at 30 if it's the
same class, 24 if it's a "similar" class (i.e. another melee if you were
a tank, let's say) and only level five if you wanted to switch from
Warrior to Enchanter or necro. 

Also, a starting kit of some "ok for your level" newbie gear could be
provided so you weren't fighting naked at level thirty. (Think in terms
of fine steel armor and a langesax type weapon for a warrior.) It would
just be gear that you could "reasonably be assumed" to have gotten by
that level.

I could see it working. In some ways it might even spice things up a bit
and people would be more inclined to wind up playing a lot more classes
than they currently do.

Of course, death would need to be far less likely, requiring some
*massive* stupidity to happen, as opposed to a flood of greens being
able to kill a post fifty character if a train comes by. Many other
examples come to mind. Slower progression, but less likelyhood of death
would be the order of the day.

And raids would wind up being totally different, since you really can't
have a raid without some folks biting the dust.

Interesting food for thought, though.
