Funny thing about all this is that most of this speed is almost entirely
unneccessary.

Mobs tend to run a bit faster than unencumbered PCs.  Say 5% faster as an
estimate.  Run 1 is faster than most mobs in the game.  Run 2 is even better.
Selos, drum or no drum, pretty much does it.  Sow, even the lowest form does it.

There -are- mobs that move faster than this.  Of these, the only one I actually
hunted more than once or twice was the Snow Griffins of Eastern Wastes.  Here,
bard speed was the difference between pulling and not, no ranger on SOW was able
to outrun one of these things across half the zone without sticking snare to
it.  Course plenty of other classes can manage to deal with the things in other
ways, but its the only example I can think of where bard speed compared to mob
speed was more than a stunt.

My bard just got run 2.  I've been saying I need run 3 so I can kite well
without having to click gear for speed...  but as a test I pulled three Tsetsian
flies and ran em to death with my Tboots off, none the worse for wear.  I still
want run 3 for charm/swarming, since its there that I tend to get hit spinning
around for target switching

Of course high speed has other uses.  For pulling in large outdoor areas, speed
means you can move -to- the targets quickly, or sweep the area quickly to find
them.  Might have to turn walk on in order to not lose them coming back... but
at least you cut the -finding- time well down.

Its also handy (but usually no more than that) for cutting down your time to
cross zones.  As a bard under 50, that means outdoor zones only, indoor zones
are almost always longer than 18 seconds across even at bard-with-a-good-drum
speeds.  At 50+, you get two minute selos, which means crossing Kael Drakkar (if
you don't stop to bank) and so forth is quite possible.

Selos, SOW, Boots, Horses... all of them pale, in my opinion, compared to Run.
Because Run never wears out, never gets dispelled, doesn't have any funky visual
or movement affects, doesn't take a song slot, and works indoors as well as
out.  Since rare indeed is the mob faster than Run 3, if speed is what you have
in mind you may just want to keep the cash and put it towards something more
useful than a pony, say a Solstice earring (cheaper than the cheapest horse) or
FT4 boots (cheaper than the most expensive boots)

What horses do for you that nothing else will is give you mana regen as if
sitting whenever you aren't moving or attacking... including while casting
spells or clicking effects on items, and without "sit aggro".  Only works
outdoors, and you have to suffer irritating graphics and movement effects, plus
worse you lose the ability to cancel spells mid cast by ducking.  I'm hardly
ever on my horse as a cleric anymore because of this last, I tend to lose more
mana by not being able to stop unnecessary heals than I regain via the constant
sit effect; I get on my horse during wipes or while buffing and in CHeal chains,
thats about it.
