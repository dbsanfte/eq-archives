DS damage comes from no source at all.  Thus, it is possible to DS a
newbie and have him "kill" mobs right and left, doing only a point or
two to them while your DS does a couple hundred per mob to kill them.
In order for him to get the exp, he must at least touch them... but need
not do more than a single point, as his one point of damage will be more
than the damage anyone else did, since noone did any damage at all!

Pets -are- expendable, bone chips are available in near unlimited quantities,
you can get a backpack of em in an hour or two of work or for a handful
of pp, malachites are even simpler and cheaper to acquire in quantity.
Originally, mage pets went up to Lapis and it seemed they would
continue upwards, requiring more and more expensive components... but
this idea was for some reason killed, and now anyone over level 12 who
doesn't have more malachites on him than he could use chain casting pets
for a solid hour is just an idiot...or used to having a porter at his beck and
call to get more at the drop of a hat.

Pets generally make poor tanks

I've never seen a mob resist DS damage, regardless of the type.  A level
50 mob will still take damage from a level 20 mage's DS placed on me.
When a mage is the low level member of a party, and facing red mobs,
his job comes down to "keep the pet attacking the right mob and keep
the main tank DS'd"
