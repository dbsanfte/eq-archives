OMG... this is *so* funny, and *so* apropos.  I went on a Naggy raid last
night just for fun.  This after having gone on many guild raids where
organization is tight and obeying the rules is key.  The pick-up Naggy raid
reminded me of how different it used to be.

These "rules" bore such a great resemblence to the Naggy raid I was on it
was scary.  =)

Thanks for sharing, Jazz.
