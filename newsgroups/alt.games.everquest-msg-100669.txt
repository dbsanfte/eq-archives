  Maybe because sometimes they DO want to inspect someone and don't want to
go through the hassle of navigating the primitive client to change the
setting whenever that fancy strikes them... and since people who are so
annoyed by being inspected can turn off the message notifying them of it,
they know that they shouldn't be annoying anybody by clicking them on
accident.

> I've had people inspecting me just to annoy me.

  Which IS rude, on the rare occassion that this happens.  In any event,
after having been given the option to turn off inspection, this "tactic" for
annoying someone is rendered much less effective, totally ineffective for
people like yourself who are so upset by the message.

  Which is pretty rude.  It's not the inspection itself that is rude,
however.  It's the difference between admiring someone's nice car, and
admiring someone's nice car and then making a persistent effort to buy it
from them.  One is flattering, the other is annoying.

  Uh, okay.  So now you have inspection notification turned ON, despite the
fact that you're bothered by it, just so you can know when somebody is being
"rude" so you can tell them to "bugger off"?  And anyway, why not ask
outright what class the person is, instead of beating around the bush with
asking permission to inspect and then trying to figure out what they are
from what they're using?  Especially since some people are so bothered by
being asked to cast spells they don't know.  Personally I'd rather somebody
just inspect me though and ask me for the buff, favor, or whatever,
especially if I'm busy.  It's easier to answer one question than two, and I
still fail to see any reason whatsoever to be offended by someone inspecting
my character.  I mean, it just doesn't make any kind of sense to think of
the action as rude.  What may or may not be rude is the action that FOLLOWS
the inspection.

  I don't see why you don't just save yourself and those around you some
grief and turn off the notification.  There are enough things that happen in
EQ that you'll have a genuine reason to get annoyed about without creating
more for oppurtunities to get annoyed and annoy others.
