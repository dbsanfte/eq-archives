If you have LoY... check your cartography map, which I believe shows
everything.

PoV, HoH: inside a cave near the PoJ scales.
PoTorment: cube thing nestled between the buildings where you zone in
CoD: inside a cave near the PoD portal
PoS: On an island at the back of the main island - you can get there via a
     tunnel that passes through the island, entrance near the PoI windmill.
BoT: On a second island behind the PoS island.

For PoV, PoS, PoTorment and I think CoD you need to be level 55 (but I
would suggest level 60). For BoT and HoH you need to be level 62.

The zoneins are fairly safe, generally speaking, though the BoT and PoV
zones are trained fairly often. The only ones I would regard as *reliably*
safe are PoS (because the zoneout is well away from the zonein) and
PoTorment (because nobody ever seems to go there. :-) )
