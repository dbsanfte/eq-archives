Yeah COH calls it exampling, where a high level char lowers his level
to play with other people or as often the case to quickly wipe out
debt, since all the exp you get goes towards that. Just wish they would
implement the run speed and jump height from COH too. After that EQ2 is
painful slow. Although being able to jump over buildings might be a tad
excessive! ^_^

Everything seems good to me in the patch. They needed to do something
about quest rewards. After all the other changes my Summoner can get
3-4% for a single green++ mob 3 levels below her. Much better then
running around trying to do various quests.

Less fishing nodes is good. Recognitions I suspect that hardly anyone
fishes, while harvesting is very popular.
