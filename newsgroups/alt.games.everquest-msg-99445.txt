Hmm, what server are you on again?  I know our most active Wizard just 
transferred to MT, because his RL friends were all there.  If you're on 
MT, give Vaeluudar a tell, and tell him I say he's a gimp. :)

I would love to help, but unfortunately, won't be on this weekend, so even 
if I could get the transfer, it wouldn't do much good.

This is the part that I'm still unsure about.  I thought you could still 
melee attack, but not cast spells.  If that is true, I would put the tanks 
with the bard, and have them get very, very close to VS, bard starts song, 
everyone else just UNLOADS on VS.  I wasn't very clear about this, but I 
was suggesting that the nukers be in another group.

Honestly, if you can't get enchanters to chain-rune, I'm not sure how you 
are going to kill this guy with a small force.  Maybe you could get 15-20 
nukers, a couple sacrificial debuffers, and just debuff, and all blast at 
once.  With enough nukers it could work, but I suspect that it would be 
easier to just get a couple enchanters who want to help.
