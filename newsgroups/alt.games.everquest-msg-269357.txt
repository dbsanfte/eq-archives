Unless they fixed it in the last few weeks, I couldn't figure out how to 
join and talk on another game's channel (EQ and EQ2) and I did what you 
mentioned here (except I put a space between "Join" and "EQ2" that I'm 
guessing you typoed and left out).

I'll try to remember to test it again tonight.
