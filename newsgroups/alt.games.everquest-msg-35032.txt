get in a group with people of different races. with your screen in
standard graphical mode (hit F10 to toggle modes from standard,
transparent and full screen) right click on the area where you see
text and it brings up the default text window. check the box that says
group so your default text action will be spoken to the group. (so you
dont have to type /g before everything you say.) then left click on
the word that says common tounge to cycle through the language choices
for your race. select a language the other people need to learn then
just type stuff and hit the up arrow to repeat it over and over. it
takes a while but after your sense heading is in the 200's its another
constructvie way to spend long medding of spawn times.
