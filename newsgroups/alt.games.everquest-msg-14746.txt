Qwinn, once spawned, should stay around. I'm not aware of any scheduled
despawn (but that's not proof, I just don't know one way or another), and
there's nothing in SL that can (or probably will) threaten him. However, I
do know that a lot of the more powerful "uber" guilds have taken to slaying
Qwinn and his brother in Rathe to get the Robe of the Lost Circle. That
*does* impact the rarety of those two monks, as they have a long respawn
time.
