When it comes to RP, some things are pretty common. It's kinda funny
when you think about it.....

Everyone wants to be the evil race/class that turns to good, or the
good race/class that turns to evil. It's pretty rare to find a
character, that is typical to the race, class with no drama in their
back story. 

With everyone trying to be unique and "special", most wind up cloning
each other. (Kinda like the "goth" crowd heheh) 

Not surprising that people clone famous fantasy characters, that were
created by people with better imaginations. :-)
