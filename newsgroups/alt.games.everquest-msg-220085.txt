	I've only been playing for a couple of months, but this change
sort of makes me feel like gee whiz after I wore out my left mouse button
getting it to 180... :-)  Why not start people at say 50?  Enough to make
it useful and reward people who do practice it...

	I think the best thing they could do to make the game more interesting
at level 1 is to make the starting weapons magic. That would make the game 
more rewarding by allowing a little more success at that level without 
unbalancing existing people's work...  Like rogue (the ascii dungeon game) 
you always started with a magic weapon nothing great but at least you 
could hit things...  Or maybe a weapon, a tunic, and some random magic item,
some people start with +2 wis armguards, others +2 str collar....
