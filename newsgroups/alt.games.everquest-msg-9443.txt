So, my son's character (Folco, the lvl 11 halfling druid) goes
and gets killed by a cyclops that jumps the ship to ButcherBlock.
Most people give him the advice of "Petition for help", which
he tries. Due to circumstance beyond his control, though, he
has to logout each time before getting an answer.

So, I took pity on him and my character (Slickriptide, lvl 9
half-elf bard) got online with him on Saturday night and
we spent a couple of hours corpse-hunting in the Ocean of
Tears. Among other things, I discovered that going linkdead
on Seafury island is a scary event, that Aviaks are not at
all like I pictured them, and that Lyssa's Locating Lyric
doesn't take height into account. *heh* Folco also learned
that Enduring Breath doesn't last forever and that it really
IS a good idea to buy a few extra fish scales when proceding
on an underwater adventure. Fortunately, we both had our
fishing poles and some bait with us. :-P

Long story short, we finally found his corpse floating
just under the waterline. He was below-decks when he was
killed and our conjecture is that his corpse was below the
waterline when the ship zoned so it stayed right at that
level when the ship disappeared. Made me wonder: if we
had stayed on the ship the whole time, would his corpse
have come majestically sailing through the walls as the
pathed over it?

Anyway, the point of this posting: While exploring under
the ocean, we came across a large bag. No, make that a HUGE
bag. Sitting there. Left-click it. Nothing. Right-click it.
Nothing. Hmmm... Try again. Nope, no joy. Neither of us
could find any way to interact with it. We finally gave it
up and continued the corpse hunt.

Anyone have any idea what it is and why it's there? Folco
figured it was just window dresssing, but it seems like a
pretty strange place to "dress up" the scenery. A sunken
ship or some coral or something would  make more sense than
a big bag.
