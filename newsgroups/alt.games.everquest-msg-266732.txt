First let me say that I haven't played EQ2, nor have I looked at someone 
else doing so.  This is entirely speculative.

In EQ1, however, you see this same phenomenum reported, and its pretty 
easy to observe for yourself.  Make a barbarian, run around a bit, make 
a halfling, do the same thing, and you'll notice the halfling is much 
faster.

Only thing is, if you actually test it out, take both characters to the 
same place and run the same distance and time it, you find they actually 
run the same speed.

What's happening is something called parallax; the closer you are to the 
ground, the faster you -seem- to be running.  Halflings are short, so 
close to the ground, so it feels like they are moving faster than 
barbarians, who are tall and thus far from the ground.

To observe something similar, as you drive along in your car, look out 
at the side of the road for a while, watch it whizzing by.  Then look 
out at the opposite side of the road, a couple car lengths further away; 
oddly, you seem to be travelling more slowly.  Look out at the horizon 
and you are scarcely moving at all.

Its possible that this isn't the case in EQ2, perhaps different races 
really do move at different speeds... test it out and see.
