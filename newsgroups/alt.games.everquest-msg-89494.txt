wow, I kill that guy so easy... I have a pet but he is known to suck. I cast
tash but I still dont have any trouble if I dont cast. To get past the
wandering sea furies, I just sit near the coast, on that little hill farhter
away from the pirate camp, looking down at Gornit. Only thing I have to
worry about then are buff beggars, but if they come to me its ok... that and
kiters
