Yes, sorry, got tangled up in the edits.

Really? And who determines these rights?

So you're going to weigh a "might" cure cancer against a certainty of
saving thousands from polio? Untold human suffering against a "maybe"?

So you meet a total stranger and you immediately subjugate your
importance, your value, to his?

Ah, communism!

The one entitled to comforts, power, and wealth is the one who takes
the steps to gain them. I'm more entitled to a nice house in the
suburbs than someone who squandered his time and money on drinking and
wenching. You're more entitled to your computer than someone who blows
his paycheck at the casino every week.

I'm not sure I see the link between entitlement and importance (or
perhaps we should change the term to 'value').

I'm sure he's duly chastised by your withholding forgiveness. Really.
Or he would be if he shared your opinion of his actions, anyway.
