Could be he had stopped to alert you of the train so you might want to
get out of the way and you either missed it, or he realized he didn't
have enough time to type out the message before you both got

Just an idea.  I'm not defending him.  I just so rarely see such
unprovoked malice, especially when the zone is right next to you. 
Malicious trains don't work too well if the person can easily evade
them.
