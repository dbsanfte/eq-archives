What points are invalid? Substitute "the author" anyplace I made a 
reference to Ben, and it all still applies completely.

Read it again. I said exactly why I thought you were being a dumb-ass.

Sure, you pointed out that you agree with them, but then go on to nit-
pick it to death, merely because you didn't like their attitude.

Again, I did. Don't fault me for your lacking in basic skills in reading 
comprehension.

You came off like the squirrelly little nerd in class that tries to 
correct every tiny insignificant bit of information the teacher might 
deliver because somehow someway there is a possible exception to it. The 
overall tone of your post was simply that you agreed with most of it but 
you were going to attack it because it offended you. Again I wonder why 
you were so offended. It was valuable and correct information conveyed in 
a clever and entertaining manner. What is your problem with it? It was 
good stuff.
