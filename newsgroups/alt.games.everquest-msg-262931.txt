Not a chance.

No drop stops only farming, and in all honesty, the FV solution seems
to stop farming quite effectively. It's not to say that people don't
farm on FV, because they do. It's just that they don't focus on just
the few mobs that drop the sellable stuff. Everything that drops on FV
can be sold. So any time something drops for a group that someone in
that group can not use, it's farming.

I may be wrong, I might just be oblivious, but I've never encountered
people camping something that I was interested in, that they were not
getting experience from. With the exception of quest and trade skill
items. (And those are either due to the massive quantities needed for
trade skilling or from the rarity of quest items.)

It's nice to be able to loot an item that is actually an upgrade (I've
done it like 6 times on one character, mostly because even though FV
has droppable Time loot, I don't spend huge amounts of time farming
PP, I just go out and do what gets me experience... If it gives me
lots of PP too, that's a nice addition. The only time I have gone to
farm greens is for trade skill stuff that I don't want to buy.) but
the better solution would be to make items decay through use. Say
every time you swing and hit with your sword it has a random chance to
lose some stats, or every time you are hit there is a random chance
that one of the armor pieces you wear get damaged. (easy enough to do,
they already have a similar mechanic with recommended levels)
Equipment drops from pristine down to junk level of quality. Might be
possible with trade skills to repair, but ultimately will wear out.
Weaker caster armor takes more damage per strike or is more likely to
be damaged than high AC tank items.

That I think would have a better effect on mudflation. More powerful
gear will still be out there, but to keep it in better shape than
stuff from the old expansions you have to put a lot of effort into it.

Of course this would never fly on an existing server, would have to be
in effect from the ground up. There will still be people who will
farm, but value of said items diminishes.
