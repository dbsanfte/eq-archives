Who gives a giant rats' whisker?  I'm 60 already, does it matter one bit
whether it takes twice as much exp to top out my bar?  No wait, in fact
the more xp it takes to do so the better, cause thats more xp I can
bank up in case I get in a situation where I have to eat a lot of deaths.

XP at 60 is all about how much AA xp I can get per hour, which should
be static across levels regardless of what they do to normal xp.
