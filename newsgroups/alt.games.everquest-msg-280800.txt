	6-8 hours of work is trivial?  Not to me.  That's about a week
of playtime for me, and it's nice to be able to actually get something
cool instead of losing 4 rolls for the stuff that did drop.

	Trivial FT is Earring of the Solstice, which every caster over
level 3 has...  And ya know what?  I like that too.  What exactly
is wrong with a few easy to get cool items? That FT3 aug or EoS isn't
going to make any character unbalancingly uber.  

	My cleric maxed FT by doing 10,000,000 LDON missions for 
those augs, and it WAS NOT fun.  Luckily I was between positions :-)
for a while back then and had time to pass.  Oh, and I added an ornate
bracer picked up for a good price in the bazaar, and was STILL only at FT11
when OOW came out and I was able to add some lucky drops.
