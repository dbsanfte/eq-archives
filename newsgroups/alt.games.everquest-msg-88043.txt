I'll double check after work today, but I'm almost positive I already
had the 23.11 drivers. I believe that's what I replaced with the 22.80
yesterday. Anyway, they were the latest drivers on the NVidia site at
the time I bought the new video cards, which was right after christmas
as I recall. But hell, I'll try anything at this point.
