Nothing sudden about it. Introducing real cash into the equation has
NEVER been allowed, and IS a violation of copyright and contract law.
I can't use copyright art on a website. I can't hand out burned CDs to
my friends. I can't sell either without the permission of the
copyright holders. The copyright holders have final say in how you can
distribute access to items within their material and still retain
possession of "your" copy of the material. Selling a CD is legal.
Selling a copy of a CD and keeping the original isn't.

Nope, but /ooc'ing that you're selling Amway and giving contact info
would be bannable as spamming....

At your home computer, yes. On Sony's servers, no. When you're logged
into their servers, anything you do on them is considered to be on
their property. They have every right to restrict access to and
activities allowed on their servers just as they would if you walked
in the front door of their office.

Fucking duh. Doesn't change the fact that the transaction is taking
place on their servers and is thus subject to SOE's rules.

Doesn't mean that it's okay to ignore the restrictions they've set on
the item transfers, specifically that they can't be bought or sold for
real world currency.

The transfer of the item and the transfer of real cash are both part
of the whole transaction. The fact that PART of the transaction takes
place on their property means the WHOLE transaction is subject to
their rules.

>>They have more right to tell you that than you have to even be

I didn't say it could, and that is totally irrelevant. Part of the
transaction takes place on their servers, so the whole transaction is
subject to their "law". Yet, you've been harping on that point for the
entire thread. You're obviously grasping at a desperate straw...
