I restarted in January and dinged 32 last night, playing roughly 3
hours a night. (Phone bill is the limit, not a real life... although
I'm trying really hard to get one of those again. They're nice)
I'm also currently a skill 49 tailor, 90 brewer, 31 smith and 33 baker
- all fun except smithing and the tediousness of getting raw materials
for tailoring. I tend to have binges where I run around Freeport for
an hour and work on my skills in between hunting :)
With the hours I had available to play my first time around, I could
ding consistently once a day except for hell levels, which took 2 or 3
days. I figured out pretty fast where I liked and didn't like to hunt
and took that information with me this time around, starting earlier
at some of my favorite places, avoiding places I had learned to
loathe, and avoiding death to a greater extent than before.
I also had my lvl 39 gear and some spare money, so I have never been
unable to afford spells and now have multiple sets of gear - I can
have 183 wis, I can have 106 cha, and I can dress up in all black.
(Resist gear is more of a problem and I am saving up for that)
I also do some light twinking on my alternate characters - they are
still very low and don't need too much gear, and I can't afford the
good stuff anyway so they get my spare pieces of armor, fine steel
weapons and a  few pp for food, bandages, spells and spell components.
I have never played an int caster, and I have never played a tank
beyond level 11, or an evil character, so I expect I'll have a lot to
learn with my gnome mage and my dark elf shadowknight.

For my druid, I've had time restraints, but I've had knowledge of the
class and of hunting grounds, I've had good gear (although that isn't
really too crucial at low levels), and I've also had my higher level
friends who have lent me a hand occasionally. However, I can catch up
with them in my own good time and they have powerleveled me less than
5 levels since I got back.

And for the record: two level 20 characters in three months is pretty
decent progress, especially when you've traveled as much as you have
with your characters :)
