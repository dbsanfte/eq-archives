3 to 5 seconds typical? Sounds way low to me, gut feeling says 8-10s 
typical with highs reaching up to 20 or so. Yaulp V is 18 sec duration 
and I'd say 1-2 procs per yaulp is rather common. Gonna go check my own 
logs when I get home tonight. I have plenty of fights that I've duo'd 
with a shammy so I've had 250ish dex, 20 something item haste (SCHW) and 
shammy haste (whatever that is at level 56).
