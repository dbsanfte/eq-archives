Im a 31 druid and I have been trying to camp the minotaur caves in
steamfont...wait for it...
The fist time there I was killed by,..as you guessed Meldrath.The next time
I was there I was prepared ...i.e. when Meldrath's pet slapped me I ran and
ran.I haddent made any copy of the cave through any EQrs best friend EQ
atlas so I just ran .
But as I left the entrance of the Mino cave with a bubble and a half of HP
left I chuckled to myself,the  thought of me racing out of the cave in the
classic "Benny Hill" fast motion with the accompanying diddy was a classic
"meat" situation.
