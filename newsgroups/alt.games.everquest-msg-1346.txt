Ok I finally got to level 7 with my Necro in this god forsaken forest.
Playing as much as I can so that I can stop having to see this place when I
boot up.  Anyway, I hit level 7 finally last night and thought, 'Hey, now I
can do the quest to kill the fisherman and turn in his pole'.  So I go over
there, and he cons yellow.  I cast darkness to pull him over to me and my
pet, and lo and behold, there are 2 of them!  Both with the same name and
both making me dead (and temporarilt back to level 6) really fast.  Whats
the deal with that?
