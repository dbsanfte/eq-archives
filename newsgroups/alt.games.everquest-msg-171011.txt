I have just started learning how a post-34 Wizard can finally realize
his potential...in groups and solo. I am interested in developing the
skill to "quad-kite". Where are the best places and the best mobs to
develop this skill and level from 36 to the low 40's quickly?

Also, I would like a description from any fellow wizards on how to
learn this technique. So far I have only used Bonds of Force to
successfully single kite. I have been soloing single Cave Bears in the
Great Divide lately.

Thank You all for any and all advice.
