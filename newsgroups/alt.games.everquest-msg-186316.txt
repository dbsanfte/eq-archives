I've hit the limit for how simple I can make something.  You offer an
alternative of roleplaying to "hack-n-slashing" as a lasting solution in the
game of Everquest.  I merely pointed out how much of an idiot that made you
appear to be and your inability to follow the context of a discussion and
instead hang your entire comment on a bad bit of semantics.

Then you proceeded to amaze and astound by not only not being able to follow
the context of a discussion, but apparently not even understanding what the
word "context" means.

And then you claim to understand all the words, but merely have a problem
comprehending sentences written in clear and unambiguous english.

You're so tied up in semantics that you don't argue side points, you can't
even *find* the point.
