Besides, wood elves DO have this innate foraging skill, and they're
the only race that should have it (growing up in treetops and in touch
with nature). Some have innate sneak ability, some have innate hide,
it's something you learn. However, as level 1's, we've been trained
inside the cities. How would we have learned how to tell which way
we're headed in unknown surroundings without the practical
application?

How's everyone's RL foraging and sense heading skills? I'd say mine
are around 10 or so. Learning how to live in the wild is not a
requirement in the world of EQ with paths and towns any more than it's
a requirement for us in RL.
