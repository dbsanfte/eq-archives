If you're going to go out adventuring, you should learn how to harvest
resources.  Your guild artisans will love you for it, and in return will
make you some pretty new toys.

All of the following material is based on my running around Qeynos; I don't
have any characters in Freeport.

There are currently 3 "tiers" of raw materials.  Tiers are determined by
where the material comes from, not it's rarity, and not it's type.  Tier 1
material comes from the newbie zones surrounding Qeynos (Oakmyst Forest,
Peat Bog, Forest Ruins, et cetera).  It also comes from the Isle of Refuge.
Tier 2 material comes from Antonica.  Tier 3 material (or so I am told)
comes from Thunder Steppes.

Material is found in several different types of nodes.  The names and
appearances of the nodes may differ between newbie zones, but the dropped
material remains the same.  For example, in Oakmyst Forest you will find
Compound Ore.  This drops tin clusters and has a rare chance of dropping
bronze.  In the Forest Ruins, the same materials are dropped by Unearthed
Stone.  (When I say rare, I mean that I've harvested over 200 tin clusters
and never found a bronze one.)

Using Oakmyst Forest as an example, there are 4 types of nodes:  Mining
nodes (Compound Ore, Moss Covered Rock), Foresting nodes (Grizzled Arbor),
Trapping node (Badger Den), and Gathering nodes (Natural Garden, Natural
Herb Garden, Muddy Roots, Question Marks).

Question Marks is really a node - it is a small question mark floating above
the ground with a sparkly thing below it.  When you harvest it, you get
random pieces for various quests - spotted blue butterflies, cracked iksar
bones, chipped alteration shards, and so on.

Now, the grouping above is important, because each one of the groups
requires a separate skill, Mining, Foresting, Trapping, or Gathering.  Each
time you harvest, you have a chance at improving the relevant skill.  In the
Tier 1 (newbie) zones, you have sufficient skill that you can harvest from
any of these nodes.  The same does not apply when you hit Tier 2 (Antonica).
In Antonica, you need a minimum skill of 40 to harvest with.  So, to harvest
Plains Fungi in Antonica, you need at least 40 Gathering.  To harvest
Windblown Wood (I think that's what it's called), you need at least 40
Foresting.  So on and so forth.

Now for the bad news.

By dint of a LOT of perseverance, I got some rough numbers for a particular
item in Oakmyst Forest.  I needed 8 points in Foresting, and in Oakmyst
Forest that means I needed Grizzled Arbor.  It turns out that if you're all
alone in Oakmyst Forest, running around, harvesting every node you come
across (so that they'll hopefully repop with what you need), you'll find
about one Grizzled Arbor every 5 minutes.  It takes on average about 4
Grizzled Arbor to get you one skill improvement.  So, you can expect a skill
improvement in Foresting about every 20 minutes.  Unfortunately, there's a
very large fly in your very small jar of ointment.  That fly is the other
players in the zone with you, all grubbing about, scrambling madly for those
very few Grizzled Arbor nodes.  With 30 people there, you can expect to grab
about 1/30 of the stuff you're after.  So, with lots of other people around,
your 20 minutes per point balloons to roughly 10 HOURS per point.  And
remember, these are AVERAGES.  I went better than 15 hours straight with no
points in Foresting at all.  On the other hand, I hit one node and got 2
points (each node except the Question Marks can be harvested 3 times before
it disappears).

In addition, there's 2 other jokers in the deck.  First, if you check the
list earlier, you'll find 4 nodes that use Gathering, 2 nodes that use
Mining, and only 1 node each for Foresting and Trapping.  So, if they're
equally possible repops, you can expect Gathering to increase twice as often
as Mining, which will in turn increase twice as often as Foresting and
Trapping.  Problem is (second joker), I don't think they are equally
possible.  I didn't keep accurate numbers (I know, I should have), but I'm
pretty sure I saw a lot more of each of the Gathering nodes than I did of
the Foresting or Trapping nodes.  And not in total; I mean I saw a lot more
Natural Gardens than Grizzled Arbor, and I saw a lot more Natural Herb
Gardens than Grizzled Arbor.

To finish off, if you're going to be going adventuring, spend all the time
you can on the Isle of Refuge maxxing your Foresting and Mining skills as
much as possible before you leave.  They are MUCH easier to improve there
than they are when you hit the mainland.
