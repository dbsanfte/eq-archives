Prefacing this with the fact that I was a GL in EQ for 3 years.  Not that it 
makes me any better than anyone (I prefer pity, actually :) ), just looking 
at it from my point of view.

My guild didn't allow "adult" language because adults don't use "adult" 
language where it's not appropriate, and I didn't feel it was appropriate in 
my guildsay and it was well known by everyone (there are a hell of a lot of 
adults in EQ who really enjoy the clean chat with nothing worse than "hell," 
"damn," or "bastard, btw).  My point, sorry.  If you said "fuck," "cunt," or 
something else bad in guildsay I would have asked you to watch your 
language.  If you started debating the issue, you would have been invited to 
leave my guild because it's obvious you wouldn't have been of the maturity 
level that we required.

That guild leader needs a LOT of seasoning.  For her guild's sake I hope she 
realizes that but I don't hold a lot of hope.  It's pretty obvious she's 
never even been in an officer position before.
