Gratz on making 30 (or will be soon). I've done the giants, and the exp is
good, cash ok, and the loot if you get some goodies to sell is worth the
stay.  Sol A is very interesting, and dangerous.  As a Troll I don't
recommend it.  The passages are very small and when the train comes (and it
will) your cheeks will hold up the running and kill your friends.  Shrink
potions are the only way to go there for you big guys.  Personally I
recommend the Overthere.  At 30 you should be able to start grouping with
the ledge people and that will give you insane experience especially if you
get into a "corner group".  You'll make tons of cash, your a evil race and
you can get bound at the dock, a short run away in the event of a death, and
there is a bank, and shopping right in the zone.
My other recommendation is Cazic Thule.  Good stuff to be had in there, the
FS sells to merchants for plat, and in a Throne room group you can maybe get
lucky on some Ravenscale or Lizard Scale to sell.
Good luck.
