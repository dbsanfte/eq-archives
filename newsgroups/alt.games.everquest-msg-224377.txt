These were perhaps the best players I have ever done a mission with.  The
necro, shaman and warrior are old friends so I knew exactly what to expect from
them.  The bard never overpulled - well, only the once.  He played mana song
every time we weren't in battle. It was an MM zone that we all knew well.  And
I think they were all pretty twinked :)
And maybe we just plain got lucky.
