A much better test would be to get a mage and a beastlord of the same level  
and a good tank 10 or so levels higher. The tank finds a mob thats blue to 
both characters, equips a pair of steins(so as not to riposte) and taunts 
the mob. Then, both pets get sent in and you see which character gets the 
exp.
