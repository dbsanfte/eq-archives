Depends on how you're collecting them... and what class you are.

Feerott is good for general melee hunting... lots of spiders and all of them
drop 'ling silk

Field of Bone tunnels is good if you have an AE nuke... one of the rooms has
quite a few spiderlings in it... one nuke can drop as many as 6-8 and they
re-pop quite quickly.

If you're a Necro or SK, then give North Ro newbie area a try... visibility
is good, so you can see them as soon as they drop and avoid the Guards if
you're KOS. I found it to be better than EC, and less people know about
it... til now, at least. As a bonus, you'll also collect more than a few
bonechips

If you can track or you have SoW or J/T boots, Everfrost newbie area is
good, if a little "spread out"...and you can collect Quality Bear pelts at
the same time... and make them up into padding as you go.
