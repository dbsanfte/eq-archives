Well, it beats Blob's obsession with raping children.

"see, the mean people know who they are. the problem is the stupid
people don't know who they are, so it's the job of the mean people
(who know who they are) to make sure the stupid people are aware that
they're stupid. see?"

=====================================================================
"What really needs to be done is to recognize that rape isn't a big
deal and stop kowtowing to every fucked in the head bitch who cries
"rape!"  Stop supporting the rape industry and send them to get
regular jobs.  Make the punishment a $20 fine like a parking ticket,
about what the "crime" deserves."
   - Bob (bobx23456) advocates rape in soc.men
=====================================================================
"While Bob's position sounds extreme, he does have a point that rape
is given far more importance than it deserves. How many men would
spend their lives crying if a woman forced them to have sex with
them? Or worry about prosecuting their wife if she forced him to have
sex with her?  The rape hysteria says more about women's frigidity
and lack of respect for men's sexuality than it does about the
severity of the crime.
