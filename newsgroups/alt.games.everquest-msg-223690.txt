For Bards, there's no item more powerful than JBoots (or TBoots are 99% 
as good).

You casters get focus items that make your spells 10% cheaper to cast, 
10% longer lasting.

But a bard doesn't benefit from any of those.

One thing will help him out... JBoots, saving 1 song out of his twist; 
an expert saves a mere 20% (one song in 5) but a good bard saves 25% 
(one song in four) and an average bard saves a full 33% (one song in three!)

OK well he may also benefit from a great drum for some songs, a great 
string instrument for others...  And a FT item is 10 times as effective 
on a bard as on a regular caster.

But still, under 2 minute selos level, I'd say JBoots is king of the hill

Llyric, 57 bard, only been off TBoots for one level, since finally 
getting Run 3
