I feel with you,retired my 54 Pally ,cause it was near impossible
to find a group,maybe it has something to do with that I am on a 
very old server,most players have 65 chars I think.

A better solution for the lfg problem would be if the difficulty
of the adventure would scale with the number of players in group.

I see no reason to play a MMORPG solo,I would prefere Morrowind
for example,a large world to explore,tons of quests,I can be the
hero who saves the world and cheat to my hearts content.  :)
