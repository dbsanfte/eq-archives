Sadly, someone in my own guild pulled this.  He was badmouthing another 
guild because he'd asked a few druids in it who were "obviously not busy 
or AFK" to port him from Steamfont to West Commons for a corpse run.  
Ummmm...?  I ask the obvious question.  "Then why not run?"  "I can't do 
that, I'm level 10 and naked."

...

I explain the concept of looking where you're running, and point out 
that Steamfont to West Commons is, actually, one of the easiest runs in 
the game.  After I'd mentioned a few times that a port wasn't even 
remotely necessary, he started getting absolutely frantic with anger, 
and told me he'd see me out of our guild, and he'd make sure I never got 
into another guild.  At this point, I couldn't help laughing, which was 
probably mean, but honestly, he'd told me he had two other chars in 
their 20s and 30s, and I had to ask him how he'd managed to bypass 
learning how to do a safe corpse run.  I finally gave up and logged on a 
level 3 mule with nothing but a guild tunic and dagger, and ran from 
West Freeport to Steamfont (reminding me how much I loathe boats in the 
process).  I think I saw maybe 3 whole mobs on the way.  Unfortunately, 
he logged off before I finished and I haven't seen him since.  A shame, 
really.  I was going to ask him what happened when he died somewhere 
that *wasn't* in the middle of civilization :p

Anyway, point being, when people pull that kind of stuff in our guild, I 
usually don't make any friends, because I challenge their assertion that 
they *need* a port, or they *need* an escort, or they *need* a rez.  
It's sad how many level 20s these days believe that nothing except a 90%
+ rez is going to do, AND expect to get it for free or near free.  Hell, 
I saw a druid begging a C3 in the bazaar the other day, because he 
needed it 'for a corpse run'.  Ooookay then.
