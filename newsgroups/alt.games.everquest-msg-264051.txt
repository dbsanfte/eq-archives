But money equals gear equals xp; thus losing the ability to sell your
services to other players has an impact. Also, since when is a taxi driver a
whore? Why is it degrading to trade time and mana for platinum? Some ports
are dangerous as well. Is a cleric rezzing for donations being a whore?
Perhaps all clerics should be required to rez anyone who asks for one. Suits
me!

Also, I haven't made any comment on the class being broken, I merely claim
it is not essential (same with monks), and should it be removed from the
game entirely, all encounters in the game, raid and others, would still be
quite doable.

On the other hand, if clerics disappeared, I imagine the effect would be
profound, and i imagine the outcry if enchanters were to vanish would be
outstanding. No Kei! No virtue! People stand about in Pok shouting for these
and whining if they can't get them. I've offerred to cast my POTC spell for
free and had no takers. I understand some zones require a wizard port to get
there (sky?). Paladins in lfay ldon's are incredibly useful. Rogues are
required if you want to open some doors eg the reavers for the original
druid epic.

I've played pet cleric for a 66 mage and i can't totally heal his pet. If I
group with a tank, my 'complete' heal is painfully inadequate. Sure you
might be able to get 2 druids to do the healing job of one cleric, assuming
the druid and cleric have earned equal xp/gear all up, but if sony wiped the
druid database, shamans would step in. I can think of a few situations where
certain quests might make a shaman's potions very useful eg fighting master
glox (sp?) as iksar monks are wont to do, a ds potion can be very handy.

There's a difference between something being needed and something being
useful as a backup, and druids are currently the backups of the EQ world,
along with monks. Nobody ever runs about shouting "druid required for
group", at best it's healer required, and if a cleric is available,
generally the druid gets to sit about lfg longer, or just goes back to
soloing.

I think this argument has clarified the whole stay or go situation. I'm
playing a pair of classes that really don't matter, that could vanish
without any impact. I'll wait until my system is eq2 ready and either move
to there or city of heroes.
