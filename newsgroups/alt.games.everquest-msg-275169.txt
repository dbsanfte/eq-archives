"The court found that "[t]he Fred Meyer store at which defendants were 
arrested is a modern replacement for the town square or park. It is open 
to the public, and citizens are invited to come and congregate on the 
premises." Id. at 212. Significantly, the court concluded that Fred Meyer 
itself had opened its property to the public: 


Fred Meyer's invitation to the public was broad and for more than just 
commercial activity. Its premises, by reason of the owner's invitation, 
became a 

forum for assembly by the community. Notwithstanding the company's 
apparent policy against allowing petitioners on its property, there is no 
evidence that defendants' activities substantially interfered with Fred 
Meyer's commercial activity, had a serious economic impact on the company 
or interfered with its "reasonable investment backed expectations." "

Hmmm - sounds to me like they're interpreting the law -- which is what
the courts are there for after all.
