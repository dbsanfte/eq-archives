This still happens in Crushbone . . . unless you are saying it was just
fixed within the last week.  Retlon still heals and protects the orcs and
still attacks with his pet.  The elven slave (only noticed one by the slaver
cave that does it) still heals the orcs.  Have never actually had a slave
attack me other than Retlon.
