I disagree with much of what you said. And vice versa obviously.

Not sure how having raiding compared to an olympic sport amounts to a 
smear, but ok. It was definately not intended as a smear.

The key similiarity:

The primary challenge is choreographing a complex plan, and then 
executing it in perfect time. The more people and the more complex the 
choreography the more challenging the execution.

It doesn't really matter about differing environments or what not. That 
ultimately only shapes the choreography, once the program has been 
devised its just a matter of running through it, whatever it may be, and 
doing it flawlessly (that being the real challenge, once the 
choreography is done.) The choreography itself is challenging, but only 
once, and only to the leaders.

Another *great* game where this was true was Rainbox 6 coop multiplayer 
on the hardest difficulty, where the opponents would instakill you (or 
the hostages) if your team made the slighest error. Its not a bad way 
for a game to be challenging... but its certainly not the only way a 
game can be challenging.

That was my point.
