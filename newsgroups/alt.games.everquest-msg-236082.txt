And between now and midnight we're going to roll back every single character
who uses the exploit .. even if they don't realize it's an exploit (who knew
that an acrylia studded mask wasn't ~supposed~ to yield 12 bazillion tribute
points?).  And oh, btw, annul any XP they may have received for a night's
gaming time ... any epics that may have been earned ... etc etc

Sometime something is discovered that's so bad that servers (not just game
servers ... RL servers in places like hospitals and banks) have to come down
right now this very instant before the error propogates itself.

Shit happens.
