Well, depending on what it is they are saying, they may very well be 
violating the TOS.  The language filter does not give people permission 
to speak in a profane manner in the game, that is still a violation of 
the TOS last I checked.  They are doing something wrong by the rules they 
agree to abide by every time they enter the game.
