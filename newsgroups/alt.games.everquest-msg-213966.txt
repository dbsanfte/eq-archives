Do you have any of your 63+ spells?  Are there AA's you 
desperately want that require a 63+ level?  Do you have
any difficulty getting groups at 62?

If the answer to any of these was yes, level.

For a given mob (say a golem in PoV) you will get a little
more xp per kill at 62 than at 65 (the high con level bonus
goes up as the level difference between you and the mob gos
down).

So, it is possible that you will get a little faster AA at
62.  Is it worth giving up the extra base mana regen you get
at 65?  The better resists?  You'll have to decide that one.
