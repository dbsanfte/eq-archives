when we kill rumbleroot (a big tree in PoG, in preparation for killing
Tunare) we always leave the first buff spot open.

What RR does is cast an ae dot, and because your first space is open, its
easy to dispell quickly after the fight, without zapping every buff.

Of course you always get a damn over zealous enchanter who uses "Strip
enchantments", and wipes 4 damn buffs guaranteed (usually group focus and
group aego too!)

I've seen and tested many many times though, and "almost always" this is how
dispell works (the exceptions that I say is buggy, has only ever been mob
dispell btw)
