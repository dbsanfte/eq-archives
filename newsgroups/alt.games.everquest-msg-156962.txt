Shadowed Men are irritating.  The encounters appear to have been
designed primarily to foil Harmony.  I've never seen them reliably
single-pulled except by a char high enough level that they were way
green (sort of a mild PLing approach).  If you've got a group that
can handle the unavoidable multi-pull you'll have their camp
cleared long before the first respawns, with little or nothing else
of suitable level to hunt likely to be available in the zone (SK
is overcamped still on blue servers, I've seen little else of
mid-/hi-twenties mobs in Lavastorm, LFay generally sucks, WC has
almost nothing else of interest at that level, ...).
