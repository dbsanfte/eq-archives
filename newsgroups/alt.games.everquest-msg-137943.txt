Practicing conjuration isn't the point here, its the fact that wizard
conjuration sucks and even at its best the familiar seems to be
annoyingly difficult to summon.

OK, you don't need the familiar while in trader mode.  But you do need
it when you leave to go do something else.

At that time, you start conjuring.  Fizzle, Fizzle, Fizzle, Fizzle, finally
got it.  Damn, OOM though.

If you leave it running, then whenever its time to go do something else,
you just port or run off and you are good to go instantly, instead
of a ten minute meditation break.  Oh, and if you -do- have that ten
minute break to wait thru, shouldn't you just as well put Trader
mode on?

In fact at higher levels, it might be worth while to bind at a stall,
kill till OOM, gate up and trader mode, then port back down
to fight again; if you are killing in a zone like CS or SF where
there's a port handy to the killing area.  Self ports and gates
aren't very expensive, and you'd get some use out of the down
time
