Smart enough.. you might have gotten more from a player, but they're lore.
And a fairly common drop. I think I get 30

Can't help you with the other 2 items. :-)

Speaking of loot.. I have THE worst luck with rolls. I lost the roll on 3
chipped velium amulets before I was able to just loot one by default. We had
a blackened crystalline robe drop, and it went to the enchanter "NBG." Wish
I had known that ahead of time.. but whatever!  A guildmate was grouped with
the same enchanter the next night, and another BCR drops.. and my guildmate
wins it. Tonight I lost the roll on a crystal grinder.

It's getting to be pretty humorous.. well, not all THAT funny. :-)
