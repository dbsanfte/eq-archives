I didn't say naked I said "one of the least equipment dependant."
Especially compared to the other hybrids and tanks classes. You can
outfit a BL with gear that will take them into their 40s for less than
1K.

I levelled a BL on the FV server solo (completely untwinked) to 44,
and my best peice of equipment was a pair of Azure Sleeves (AC12). The
rest was a mix of Ulhork (sp), and other odds and ends (5/55hp ring,
jagged band, orc fang earings). I never raised my Wis over 95, and had
no trouble soloing. I used a pair of Polished Steel Ulaks (purchased
for 25pp each) most of his career. I didn't get any thing better
(Fighting Baton) until I hit my mid 30s)

No, you just need a steady flow of dark blue cons that don't hit very
hard. The hunting section over at www.eqbeastlord.com is full of great
hunting spots that a gheto-equiped BL can solo just fine at.

True, but 1-27 requires decent equipment if soloing
