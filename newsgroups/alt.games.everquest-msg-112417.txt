Your problems were probably more to do with your system setup rather 
than purely the OS itself. Sure WinME is a more fragile OS, but its only 
  really noticible when using many programs at once or leaving it on for 
hours and hours (things start getting chuggy and a reboot is needed). 
For games I think its the best option. I say get the latest Win9x 
drivers for your hardware, backup your files, and have a go at 
reinstalling with WinME. Seriously, I think its worth it just for the 
sound alone! Apart from the music you're missing out on there are all 
the environmental effects which you don't hear under Win2k. It also 
boots a hell of a lot faster than Win2k and uses less memory.

Just IMHO :)
