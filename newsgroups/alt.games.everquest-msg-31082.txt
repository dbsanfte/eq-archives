Richard is correct, Paul.  You have to call Verant to sort it out.

CD Keys, once installed, are "soul-bound" to the particular login account
that you set up when you install the game.  --the actual name you use to log
in--.  You haven't been able to get through because they have deactivated
your account for not being paid.  Heh, also, the keys for each subsequent
expansion are forever linked to that account as well.

On the upswing, if Verant has not deleted your keys from their database,
they _m-a-y_ have your characters as well.  With them keeping your key
codes, they have prevented you from signing back on without intervention,
but they may also have your old characters/gear in the same place.

Good luck to you,

-Grim
