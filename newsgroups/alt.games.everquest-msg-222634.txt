hmmm... I am sure it still works (ive been wrong before), but not on
all effects... it drops the old effects, you still will need to go
into options to turn off the extra particle effects... but alas, im
not at home to verify this now...

Agreed, that is worded very badly (ill attempt to blame somone else at
this point).....

True, I have noticed when running on a slope (particularly in Luclin)
that when attempting to stop and turn, I am still moving in the
original direction... as if the slope has a frictionless surface..,
But generaly speaking, this is a great skill to use...  lol, in fact
Ive done it for so long, I even do the twist when I have just stood
from meding...

Quibbles and bits... quibbles and bits... no worries here....
