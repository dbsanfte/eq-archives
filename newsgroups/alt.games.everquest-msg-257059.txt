The 'Tainer of Souls' is the Ragebringer.  I linked my Ragebringer to a
necro friend of mine, he cast Identify, and it came up as Lore: Tainer of
Souls.  Though I still haven't found any confirmation of it, I'd presume
that it's refered to as this because part of the rogue epic involves going
to Plane of Hate and snagging an item called the Book of Souls, which is a
book that lists the lives that Innoruuk has tained over the years.
