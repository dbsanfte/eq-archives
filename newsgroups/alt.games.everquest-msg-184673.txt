Have you tried AEing? We can clear VT extremely fast that way, with
usally 45-55 people in the raid.

I know where you're coming from. I've had extensive experience with
the award system and I really dislike it. It can help the casual
players, but hardcore people can get very frustrated. The DKP system
has its own share of problems but at least you know you can get a
particular item if you save up your points.

For a hardcore player in a high-end guild that sounds low. In my
previous guild, using an award system, I got 2 upgrades in 5 months,
one of which (THO earring) I replaced a few weeks later when the PotC
earrings came out. In my new guild, I've been off probation for about
2 weeks and have gotten 1 item, the Leggings of Judgement from AHR.
{big grin} I could have gotten about 3 items but I was hoping for the
leggings or torch. In a given week we probably get 40 pieces of decent
loot with a roster of 70-80 active people.

I have that! I got it for 20 dkp as an applicant when no one else
wanted it. I absolutely hate the look, but it is slighly better than
my epic.

Doesn't sounds like you're a loot whore. A big chunk of the game is
watching your avatar grow in power, get better gear (& spells if
applicable) and take on greater challenges. You're not getting the
reward to make up for the time spent on the game. 

An award system usually ensures that everyone gets something at
roughly the same pace. If you have a lot of people in the guild and
not a lot of loot you're going to run into this problem. A DKP system
may be more to your liking because it rewards time spent. Even if you
get no drops from a particular raid, you still benefit.

I would encourage you to talk to your officers. Unhappy or frustrated
clerics are taken very, very seriously. Good luck.
