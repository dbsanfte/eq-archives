No real substance here, just relating what I saw last night while playing my
lvl 10/11 cleric in WC.

While the Paladin I was grouped with had to go AFK for a bit, I wandered
around attacking bears.  All of a sudden I saw a Griffin.  It was real cool.
I had heard of them from this board and different web sites, but I finally
got to see one.  Woo Hoo!  I hid under a tree and watched it go by.  When he
came back, we were off again attacking Orcs and Kodiaks.  A huge Hill giant
walked by.  Very Cool!  I hid near a tree and watched it go by too.  Later
on we were traveling on andhe asked me if I wanted to take on a Shadow Man.
I had never even heard of this guy, and almost walked right into it.
Someone else had battled this SM as he was near a tree, (see, MOBS hide near
trees too) and was at 30%.  We decided to wait till he reached 51% and see
if we could take him out.  We were both sitting and talking when at the same
time we both asked where it went.  Oh well, it got away and my new Pally
friend got to make fun of me when I said I had never seen a Shadow Man
before.  (who has?  they are invisible)

Over all, a fun and rewarding night in WC for a lvl 10 to 11 Cleric and lvl
14 to 15 Paladin.
