Tradeskill point purchasing is capped for those skills at 21.....I found
up to lvl 20 or so I was happily spending points on useful things and
improving handy skills. After that I tended to open languages - I dont
know why really from a machanistic point of view its nuts but I just felt
a wandering ranger should know a lot of languages...you noted 'soon to
play on FV' where thats not such a bad idea.

Now I have hit lvl 35 and beyond those points are not a great deal of use
to me I accumulated a few levels worth and it was handy when I started
shawling - to get pottery to 21 and baking as well.

What I do in the future I dont know...likely Ill put them into my
abadnoned weaponskills and languages.
