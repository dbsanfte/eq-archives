Nope. That used to work many moons ago but it got fixed. If JS tries to
close a window instance that wasn't opened by it, or if JS tries to close
the only instance of the browser, a pop-up jumps up asking you to confirm
it.

If the browser crashed, then the browser doesn't like something it found
on the site. I had no difficulty loading it up. (IE and NS both worked
just fine)
