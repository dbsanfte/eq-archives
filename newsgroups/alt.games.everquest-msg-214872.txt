Not at all. If breaking a legally binding contract wasn't illegal,
there would be no legal recourse. The fact that the other party can
sue means that the breach of contract violates contract law.

The lawsuit in the above example isn't for speeding, it was for
causing injuries. Yes, the fact the person was speeding is what made
them responsible for the cost of the injuries, but a private citizen
cannot sue anyone for speeding alone.
