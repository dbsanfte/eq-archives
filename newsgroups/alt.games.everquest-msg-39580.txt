Hi, Folks

I just started playing Everquest. It's great game.
Problem is I bought small box version that doesn't come
with full size manual.
Now what I'd like to know is how to make hot keys/buttons.
I want to make hotkeys such as ' /assist' and some other commands.

Another question is how do I change instruments fast?
How do I set up keys/buttons to change between weapons
and instruments? (Yes, I'm a Bard)

I'd appreciate any help.

Thanks in advance.

For commands such as assist, you firstly must set them up as a "social" on a
spare Macro button.
Macros, Spell gems, Melee slots & inventory slots can all be hot keyed by
hovering cursor over the appropriate Macro or Melee/inventory slot, press
and hold left mouse button until the Macro appears on your cursor, then drop
onto a hot key slot.
This is the key to weapon/instrument swapping.  Your main attack Hot key
bank will include the 3 or 4 songs you will be using, both Primary &
secondary Melee slots & (in my case) an inventory slot containing a bag. The
bag holds my instruments & any weapons I wish to use.
By right clicking on the bag hot key, the bag opens. Pick up the weapon you
are currently wielding from its hot key slot, drop it in the bag over the
instrument you want, drop the instrument in your secondary melee slot.
Use the same method to change instruments - except that you will be able to
pick up the new instrument first & drop it over the old instrument.

It all sounds a bit complicated but it is a lot easier in practice.
