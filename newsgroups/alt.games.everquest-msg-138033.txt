}Some things are pretty well established. Examples are that higher

}skill over 250, it acts like a *lower* skill level.

I've heard that too, but given a lot of experience skilling up skills with 
255 Int, I don't buy it.  It seems very close to the same as 250 int, 
which conforms nicely with that graph I saw that one time... hm.  Ah, here 
we go.

I don't know how much data these graphs are based on, but Laurefin has a 
good reputation in the EQTC forums for this sort of thing. :)

Oh, and here's a massive thread on the subject:

}The failure rates seem to be *fairly* well understood for basic cases.
}There's just some arcane random number generator in there that gives you
}a tiny chance of success on something way over your skill level, and
}apparently a 5% chance of failure on something completely trivial to
}you. Recently I converted two full stacks of wulf fish into high quality
}fish bones for Orlun. I had two failures out of forty tries, so that
}number seems fairly valid.

There is some data that suggests it may not be a constant 5%, as was 
previously thought.  Some very trivial recipes are coming out more like 4% 
failure for large data sets.

}The effect of skill bonus items is likewise muddled. Do they "stack" if
}you have more than one item?

No, apparenty not, even though Verant said they're supposed to.

http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1990.topic

}How/where do they have to be equipped to give the bonus?

Most of them only fit in one slot.  There is apparently a priority order 
to the slots, and it wil use the first relevant skill bonus it comes to in 
that order, rather than the highest.  So if you had two pri/sec bonus 
items with different +X%s, and swapped them, it would change your 
effective bonus.

}How can you confirm that the bonus is actually giving
}you a higher effective skill?

Yes.  Exchange between Solastar and Bruke in this thread:
http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=1242.topic&start=101&stop=120

}If you have a 200 skill at smithing and
}equip a 10% skill modifer item and a 5% modifier item, do you get an
}effective skill of 230? (which would just be 115% of 200) Or do you get
}an effective skill of 231? (Which would be 200 plus ten percent, then
}plus five percent of *that* result.) Or does it just take the higher of
}the two items and only give you that, resulting in an effective skill of
}220? Can these effects even *be* stacked?

No. See above. :)

}Of all the skills, foraging is probly the most obscure. It's not like
}you forage up some roots and get a message saying "You can no longer
}increase your skill by foraging this item."  And the rare things we are
}often looking for these days seem to remain just as rare. I asked
}previously if I could take a level one iksar with just native racial
}forage ability to WW and forage for dragon eggs successfully. Some said
}yes. Others said of course not.  So what effect your foraging skill
}level has on your chances of success is, to me, pretty obscure.  Tossing
}in an item with +10% to your foraging skill seems like it would be
}impossible to test out with hard figures.

I suspect you're right, there. :)  I have heard vague rumors that foraging 
skill does not change past Foraging(100) but I don't have a link for that.

Other bits to note:

a FAQ, but possibly slightly old (6/26/02):

http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm61.showMessage?topicID=16.topic

A good thread on foraging:

http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=1608.topic&start=1&stop=20

Evidence that you once needed high skill to forage rares, but may not 
anymore:
