Collapsed medicine bag and collapsed bearskin bag fit inside other bags.
But to use them for alchemy combines they must be "unfolded" wich is done by
placing them in a main inventory slot and right klicking them.This gives you
a collapsible medicine bag/bearskin bag that can be used for combines.
When you have the new bag on cursor switch it out for the collapsed one and
put that back in you backpack.
Now you can happliy make your combines in the newly summoned bags, and after
you're done you can simply destry the summoned bag(s). Jusy make sure you
double check so that you DO NOT destry the collapsed bag, ie. the one that
canï¿½t be opened like a bag, can be placed inside a container and that you
payed plenty PP for :)

There was until last patch a bug with the collapsible bags in that you could
only do NEW recipy combines in them but that hs been fixed now so they can
be used for any recipe.

They do not give any bonus to skills, only the added bonus of not taking up
main inventory slots when you are not using them, for bonus to skill you
should look for a "Alchemy Geerlok" wich is a thing you hold in main hand
while brewing potions for a 5% boost to skill.
