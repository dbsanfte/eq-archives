I got Morrowind yesterday, after you suggested it.  I am very pleased so
far.  I looked at a review of the game and was glad to hear this game is so
detailed.  I think I read where there is over 100 dungeons that can be
explored.  My Pentium 4 and Geforce4 are finally getting a workout with this
game.

Thanks again.
