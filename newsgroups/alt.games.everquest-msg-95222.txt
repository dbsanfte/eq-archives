There is a movie on this page about the "running of the trolls"

What they did was make a newbie troll, went pk (to prevent run by buffs),
and started at the Grobb entrance in Innothule.

First person to reach the Neriak entrance in Nektolus was the winner, their
prize was a 10 dose gate potion to the location of thier choosing.
