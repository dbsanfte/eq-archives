Ok ok... thats it youve just GOT to be trolling now.... Not even a self
absorbed teenager could be this willfuly ignorant.

Once more using small words with as few syllables as possible.

ANY private organization, can refuse service to ANY individual, either with
or without reason. The fact remains that Sony and Vi are a private
organization, and as such can deny service to anyone they wish. The fact
that they are a business eager to make a profit leads them to allow just
about anyone to use thier PRIVATE service.
