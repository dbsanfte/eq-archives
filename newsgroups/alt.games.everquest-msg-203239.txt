It's the only part of the game I talk about anymore.  My characters are
basically born at level 50 these days, so I don't pretend to still know
what the game is like at those levels, and haven't since Kunark.  :)

I don't think it's so different at lower levels though.  The mechanics are
the same.

There is one type of fight that monks will outdamage wizards on, and that is
a fight that lasts long enough for wizards to run out of mana, but not long
enough for them to get a second run.  Those fights are pretty rare, and at
lower levels seem nonexistent.

This is all only pertinent to raiding.  I don't do exp groups all that much,
and even when I do the chances of a wizard being in the same group are
pretty slim since we both fill the same spot.
