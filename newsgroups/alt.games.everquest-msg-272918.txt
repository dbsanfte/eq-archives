    Wow, you're the only person I've heard of that utilizes them to that 
extent. What level of character(s) were you playing? What task masters did 
you use? Did you find options for characters that traditionally are poor 
soloists? A lot of the ones I've seen (DL, Taskmaster Klok) were "go solo 
Nurga, wretch" with the odd "go here, talk to Bob". If the "go here, talk to 
Bob" ones are as worthwhile as you are indicating, I might make more use of 
them.
