Notice I say "a ton" and that is what it takes without going on a kael
raid.

Sure, if you are level 35 and group with people there its an appropriate
way to get like 300 pluses or whatever it takes if you want to spend that
much time in the great divide. If you are around level 49 or more it
makes much more sense to jump in some groups in kael, even pick up ones.
Even the non arena super uber faction pluses are way bigger than just on
outdoor giants.

Exactly, the difference is that you can get to glower dubious NEVER
having killed any outdoor giants by going on ONE kael raid in like 3
hours. YOU CAN'T get to glower dubious in 3 hours of outdoor hits.

Exactly. I like how someone says you are incorrect in saying its hard and
takes a ton of hits then they tell how they raised it on a ton of hits.
