Several Guilds have died recently on Modern Rasp.  While none were what
could be considered High End Guilds, it is very disconcerting (I don't
even know if Rasp has a High End Guild).  All Guilds lost are being
blamed on EQ2 playing, not just Drama.  My guild im in is a primarly
family guild thats wants to move up on content.  We tried Rumblecrush
with a 2 group (avg level 54) and got owned ;p  And that Animist(sp) in
Riwii with two pets, all I saw was loading, please wait ....
