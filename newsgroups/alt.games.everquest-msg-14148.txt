Note that there is also a new dragon in WL - Ronaldar or something.

He's on CoV faction, white (kinda like the guards in SS), red to L50 and may
be a wizard or enchanter (whacked one of my group mates with something that
looked like an upgraded GFlux for 1240 damage). Hangs out more or less
half-way between Kael and SS on the North wall. He doesn't see through
invis. Doesn't respond to hails either (I am indifferent to CoV).
