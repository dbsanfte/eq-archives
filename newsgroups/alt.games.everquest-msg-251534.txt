There are alot of private web sites.  But something more legitimate like
kazams or casters.  The suggestion that Sony provide initial performace
posts was just an idea but the main idea is that something more formal
something easy to find something that everyone knows about even the nominal
players.  Also something that is more than just one persons analysis.
Acutal damage/performance logs would be most usefull.  As for the consensus
you spoke of, the fact that so many marginal wepons and items are over
priced shows that people are actualy buying such items and if so that hype
is taking presidence over acurate knowledge.  If there were some place where
people could see a side by side comparison of mele logs then the hype would
be alot less and prices would more acurately reflect the differences between
items.  These web sites you speak of are not easy to find.  They dont show
up in the first few pages of search engins and it takes hard work even by a
vetern net surfer to find them or hours of reading news groups and other
kinds of postings.
I cant believe that most of the people that play everquest actually have the
time to spare to do the long hours of research to gain such knowledge.  So
hence we have so many players taking advantage of ingnorance and hype
to sell items.  Its frustrating for everyone because theres not much of a
way to be an educated buyer.
