Hi,
  My main character is a level 25 Wood Elf Druid. When I was a  "baby"
druid, I had some awesome higher ups help me. The first was a dark elf
necromancer named Nevrill . He was levelling at Butcherblock Because he was
KOS he gave the loot to me. For absolutely no reason except to be kind to a
newbie. A druid named Kayella gave me my fine steel scimitar and a bind when
I needed it most. Another dark elf helped me in Lake Rathe. These people
were kind to me just because... when I play I try to remember them and help
newbies.
