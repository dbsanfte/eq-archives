Hi

I was sat on the bridge in South Karana the other day, watching the ole mana
level rise up, (slooowly) when this guys comes up to me and asks for a SoW,
no problem, duly cast the buff upon him.  The guy thanks me and says "38
huh, lol you won't like dinging 39".  Oh oh here we go I thought to myself.
"Oh! Why not?" I responded.  "Because it will take you a day or two
wandering around to find all your spells ha ha, I have a 43 Ranger, took me
four days ha ha!" he said.  "Thanks....enjoy the SoW" said I   : (

Is it true?

Can't I be lazy and wander into a guild and get the lot, tell me he was
pulling my leg....

It's true isn't it : (

Ah well, it's about I got of my arse and did something other than kill,
kill, kill   lol
