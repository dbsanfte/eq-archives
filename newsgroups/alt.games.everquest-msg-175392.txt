To call something overhyped before its out is premature. That may be a
label slapped on it after its release perhaps. You point out that
thier focus is on graphics. Have you seen the intended features of
SWG? Far more than pretty graphics. I cant say much about EQ2 at this
point, but SWG (if the intended features go in and work - perhaps a
big if) is one of the more complex online games in development.

I agree with you that EQ has lost its original vision. It had to,
unfortunately. In order for it to keep its customer base and draw in
new players, it had to expand and grow. The original design was
somewhat short sighted. They didnt anticipate the huge interest (i
recall interviews with Smedly how EQ far exceeded thier expectations).
The game today is vastly different than it was when the servers were
first flipped on. If they hadnt added the content they did, im sure
most players would have gotten bored and moved on (as some still do).
The limits of the original framework were realized quickly. Do you
think if there was still a level 50 cap, there would still be the same
number of players? Theyve shifted the focus of the game - for good or
bad (a topic for a different debate I suppose). Pretty amazing tho,
that theyve held the interest of many gamers for many years (just
about 4 now).

Hopefully they've learned from thier mistakes and can plan SWG and EQ2
to better support growth without drastically changing the game.
