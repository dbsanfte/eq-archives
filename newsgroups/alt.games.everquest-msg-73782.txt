Unfortunately, he's on Morel Thule, where the etiquette is you get your
pearl, then you put your name on a list, and the next person up on the
list is the person who gets Ragefire.... putting you about 6 months away.

Titan Lords has killed Naggy about 6 times since the SOL release, what
with all the patches, basically any time there didn't seem to be anyone else
ready to go for him.  If Ragefire devolved to the guild killing Naggy... well
we'd still be nowhere, since he doesn't spawn until several days later,
and the patches are coming too close together to ever allow him to spawn!

Ixiblat Fir is actually easier to kill, as there is no 52- level cap on him.
One
good group of 60s could take him down, as can any raid sized force with
a high  level tank and some clerical support.  He respawns quickly, so the
usual drill is to assemble several clerics with their shells and do him several
times in a row.
