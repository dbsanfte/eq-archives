It would be bad for the game (imo) because it would make part of
game play an out-of-game activity.  That, btw, is the same reason I
disagree with those who think you shouldn't have to be logged into
the game in order to be selling in bazaar.

There're some things that would make it easier, but I'd prefer they
did none of them.  The more automated they make things the less a
part of the game they are.  While I don't have a problem with the
guild tool (guild management applies to very few players and so is
already removed from general experience) and the LFG tool (it helps
deal with an activity that just shouldn't be a such a big timesink)
and the bazaar search tool (because it just isn't reasonable to
have to window-shop 500 PC vendors, imo).  But I don't really want
to see the bazaar search tool upgraded (even tho being able to, for
example, exclude NORENT items from a search would make it easier)
because that would make the flea market even less a part of game
play than it already is.

IMO, out-of-game is a bad idea, as you may have gathered.  ;)
It would be cool if there were a way to reduce lag in the bazaar,
without resorting to the sort of things you're suggesting here.

One might as well ask:  "Other than the laggy graphics and the walking
about what's the difference between EQ and an FRP chatroom?"

We can hope they'll to this.  Better yet:
1) Turn off familiars and pets in Bazaar and PoK
2) Any Bard who plays a song that spams a "... but you are protected"
message at other players for more than 30 seconds out of any 60 minute
period while in PoK, Nexus, or Bazaar shall be insta ported to some
inconvenient auto-death location similar, or even identical, to that
PoP encounter (Rallos Zek?) with the anti-exploit code.  The ideal
implementation of this would require another player to actually be
spammed by the Bard, allowing the inconsiderate ass to believe he was
ok and go AFK until somebody came along to trigger his just punishment.

hmmm...

Yeah, I actually agree here, some generic options like "tradeskill
modifier", "exclude NORENT", "combat effect", and "click effect"
would be nice.

I much prefer what we have to something automated beyond any resemblence
to the game.  THat said I can see room for improvement without crossing
that line (wherever it might be).
