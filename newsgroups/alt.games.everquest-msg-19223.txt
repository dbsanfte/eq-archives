Even when in the middle of casting a port spell?

And if the asker HAD been a great person, he wouldn't have made a
stink because someone didn't take the time to interrupt for him. He
would have accepted a 'sorry', and the whole thing would have been a
non-issue.

I am not a buff-o-matic portable SoW dispenser and I am fortunate to
be in a guild where favors are appreciated, not demanded. Anyone who
wants me to interrupt a port spell had damned well better have a
better reason than wanting a speed boost - I'll stop on my passenger's
request, I'll sometimes stop for an extra passenger, and I might be
more prone to stop for other reasons with the change to ducking. But I
don't care who walks up to me asking for buffs when I am already
porting - they're just plain too late for it.
