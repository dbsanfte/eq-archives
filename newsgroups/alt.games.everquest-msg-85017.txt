Hope someone can help - I've had EQ for 3 weeks now and can't get enough of
it.

However, I was wondering if anyone had some helpful weapon/item/clothing
tips.
I'm based in G Faydark an have been grouping in CB to great effect.
I'm equipped with a Shiney Brass Shield (/randomed 1-100 and got 82, yay !)
leather clothing (none magic) and a morning star.
Is this the sort of equip setup that suits me best ? I am lead to believe
there are
a few mag items (boots and gloves) in Felwithe but haven't gone there yet.
What sort of prices am I looking at - I think I have about 60pp - hard to
get my
hands on them there cb belts and pads when your're igniting from the back !
(Another thing - where should I be positioned - I understand I don't melee
well, so midfield or at the back with a wiz ?)

Any advice would be appreciated from a struggling Wood Elf up to her neck
in Orc blood.
