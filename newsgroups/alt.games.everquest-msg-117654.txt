and the problem with this is?? obviously you don't come from Australia,
otherwise you would know that
this is a pretty good bargain. All the software programs in Australia are
DOUBLE the price they are in the US.
eg. Scars of Velious - $60aus. $150 for the programs plus some game time and
ain't so bad, if you don't want
the characters on this guys account, delete em, that ain't so hard now is
it? or use the ones already there.
