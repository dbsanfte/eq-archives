 >If you would get the same turnover at the higher price,
 >would you raise prices?

No. The price I charge is a fair charge, IMO, and gives
me a fair return on the time spent. If, at any time in
the future, I have to cut back on the time I spend ingame
overall, that would make the time I spent 'worth' more
to me and I would raise prices or quit providing the dye
altogether.

I've had experience with this in RL, too. I have a hobby
that I do that is enjoyable to me. Other people do the
same thing *I* do, but they do it and sell the results
as a source of income. For me, I do it and sell the results
as a way to get more supplies to do it and a little bit
extra so I can do some for myself at basically no cost
to myself. I feel bad that, for some people, I might be
cutting into a source of income for them, but I don't
feel obligated to put the same value on my time as they
do.
