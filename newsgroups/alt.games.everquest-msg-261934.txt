Any pet class can solo kite.  The trick is to find a wide open area you can 
run around in without danger of agroing additional mobs.  You turn pet 
taunt off, and do your best to keep the mob mad at you.  As a BL, maybe 
that is more difficult, your warder generates a fair amount of agro with 
procs and doing serious damage.  If you can keep the mob mad at you, it 
will run after you while your warder beats on its back.  The best way to 
keep agro is to use high agro spells, slow the mob, DoT the mob.  Keep 
applying DoTs as they wear off, and if need be, cast your slow more than 
necessary, it is fairly high agro, even if it is resisted.
