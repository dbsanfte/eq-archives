Agreed, rangers suck til EQ/AM3, which you can't ever really count on them 
having from level alone (though you can be sure that a sub-59 ranger will 
never have them, and this thread is about 50+); I've seen level 65 Baron
(ess) rangers (and subsequently laughed my ass off at 'em).  Our DPS pre-
EQ/AM3 is some of the worst in the game (gets a little better once we get 
swiftwind, but still not close to monks), we can't ever really tank 
anything unless we're slumming (we can handle a mob or two if the tank goes 
down, but the cleric WILL be OOM by the time we're done), so all we're 
really left with is snare.

Once we have that AA though, the perspective changes entirely.
