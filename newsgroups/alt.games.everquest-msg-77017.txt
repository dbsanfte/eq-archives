Yeah, but the Queen is almost always up, and not too hard if you have the 
correct strategy.  Hint:  If you kill her fast enough you only have to 
take the AE once.  
I love raiding royals in Chardok, and it's a great way to tell how much 
your guild has improved.  When we started on Chardok we kept a camped out 
cleric and rogue in the safe hall (no longer safe) just because we would 
wipe ourselves out at least twice every time.  We were able to handle 
Prince and King pretty well, but the Queen ate our lunch every time.  Then 
we did it some more, and got to the point where we would train ourselves 
with Prince room, just because it was faster than pulling 1-2 at a time.  
This past weekend we went down to farm royals, probably 30 minutes after 
the first people zoned in we had dropped the Prince and the Herbalist.  
If it weren't for some poorly timed lag that made about 6 of us run into 
the Queen room while rushing the King, we probably would have had less 
than a dozen deaths the entire night.  Trying to deal with King, Queen, 
and all the Queen's henchmen at once is still beyond us.
