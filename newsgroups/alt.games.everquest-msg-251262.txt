Thats right, clerics don't get a pet either.

A useful pet is one that can hold agro while their caster masters blast
away.  The cleric hammer does some damage (not a lot), but can take almost
no damage.  One hit by even a mid level mob and it dies.   If a cleric is
trying to solo, he either has to maintain agro on himself or not use the
pet.  (No root and blast, because as soon as he backs away, his hammer
dies.)
