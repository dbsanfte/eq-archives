I tried that when Luclin came out, except going the other way--to Shadow
Haven.  If you've got sneak, you can get through PC.  There are a lot of
places that look like you won't be able to sneak, but the mobs are facing
just right, and you can get on a wall or something to get behind them, that
you can do it--if you watch the wanderers and make sure none is coming at a
bad time.

It's quite a fun little adventure.
