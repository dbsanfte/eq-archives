I did.  Right there.  And I said exactly what I meant to say.

That's very true.  OTOH, is you spend the rest of the afternoon on Cloud 9
for dropping a paper ball in a garbage can from 10 feet ... if you make it
your sole source of conversation for another three or four days after that
... you're dug in too deep.

People get that way about things like their epics or what zone they've
raided in.  Not everyone, thankfully, but some do.  There are folks that
live for it.  IMO, to derive that much of your self esteem from it is
indicative of a much larger self esteem issue.

It's becoming increasingly more difficult for the power gamer and the
non-power gamer to coexist in the current environment.  If there exists
separate environments for each type of gamer where they can play similar
games (I'm talking genre and lore, really) in their preferrred style
(hardcore or relaxed), I think both populations will be happier campers.
That's my truest hope for EQ2.

That just my opinion, of course.  As is every comment I've made in the whole
subthread.
