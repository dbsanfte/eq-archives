If you want to buy/sell stuff but don't feel like running to PoK,
there is also a female Iksar vendor in the mudpit in the Northeast
part of the zone that sells food/drink/bandages, etc., and buys and
sells to all races (think she also is kind of a ripoff but I'm not
sure if she's as bad as the outpost vendors).
