Poking about on the web, I ran across something I'd missed for my 
Berserker; at level 10 there's a discipline called Focussed Will.  Its 
available only thru a vendor in EC tunnels, as are a couple other higher 
level disciplines.

Well, I ran right over and picked it up, ran it back to the guildmaster 
in POK and trained in it.

Its hard to see what it does, really, experimenting lightly didn't show 
any particular effect.

Reading on Lucy, it looks like the effect is a 3 hp per tic regen, with 
a 1 minute duration.  Oooh, 30 hp extra for using it.  No wonder I 
couldn't see it!

1 minute duration, 5 minute reuse time.  This averages out, then, to 6 
hp per minute, about half a hp per tic.

Maybe I'm reading it wrong (I've never been good at getting facts out of 
the Lucy format.

Now the discipline warns that it will break if I commit any agressive 
acts.  So no attacking with it on, probably no throwing either, maybe no 
intimidating.  Dunno, never saw it break, either sitting patiently nor 
running around looking for the next kill.

Lucy also says something about "make fragile" in its description.  While 
I suppose that might mean the part about not doing anything aggresive 
lest you break it, it might actually mean some kind of added 
vulnerability, I'm not clear.

Funny thing, based on how useless this seems at the moment, is that it 
cost me 9pp, while even my 20 axe tome only cost me 2pp; not till 24 did 
I get a tome which cost more (the stun one cost me 36pp)
