You MUST delete the old drivers! There is no choice in the matter. If
the older drivers are even partially in place, they will screw up the
new card. 

The drivers are what tell the hardware how to function. It is
impossible for your new Radeon to use drivers written for another
card. Especially when it trys to run in 3D. 

If that Compaq has an ATI card built-in (most likely a Rage Pro, or
Rage 3D), you have to disable it and remove the drivers. You can
always download the drivers for the built in card from Compaq, and
reinstall them if you decide to remove the Radeon.

To sum up...

Hardware requires the correct drivers. (Soundcards, Video cards, etc.)

Drivers define how the hardware will function and what it is capable
of.

DirectX is an interface between games and drivers. DrirectX "learns"
what your video card is capable of from it's driver file and then uses
these capabilities in the games that you play. If you have the wrong
driver, then DirectX enabled games will not run. End of story.
