I couldn't see a warrior solo'ing to 60, 48 yes (I solo'd most of 46 - 47)
but at 48 even the lowest blues can kill you. Sure, twinked enough (if you
were solo'ing you're equipment wouldn't be that hot) and you could possibly
get passed 50. At 50th level I couldn't kill the lowest of blues in DL
(Stonegazer Chickens and Drolvarg Gnashers) without buffs and heals from my
druid.
The trouble then becomes finding mobs you can kill and then rest, this would
realistically mean an outdoor zone and that would mean Velious or Kunark,
mobs there hit too hard and have far too many HP to be able to solo for a
Warrior. Lower Guk or Sol B would be an idea but with out the back up of a
full group I wouldn't fancy your chances of doing anything a part from dying
or making trains.

Couldn't really speak for any other melee class, only played my SK to 30. I
do agree that a rogue has less chance (lower AC and Health and their main
damage comes from a mob attention being elsewhere)

CF
Pretty much solo'd to 35 but after that it was time to hit OT
