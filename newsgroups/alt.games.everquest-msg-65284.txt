Ah, ok, I get it. The card-edge connectors of the cards are not at
issue. The problem is with the back panel bracket of the cards.

The old card sounds like some kind of goofy custom thing to work
around what I suspect is a non-standard case design.

You wouldn't happen to own a Dremmel kit, would you? :)

Or are the audio connectors mounted directly onto the motherboard? If
that's the case, you are very probably screwed. I know you're tired of
hearing it, but your best option may well be to slap together a new
machine.

Sean Lowe and I don't get along, but on one point I'm in complete
agreement with him - it's remarkably easy.
