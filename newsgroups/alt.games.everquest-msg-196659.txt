Sorry Ed, but that's almost too stupid for words.  If it hurts to
play a Bard then play something else!  How fucking hard to understand
is that?  If you're allergic to shrimp eat hambruger.  If high heeled
shoes hurt your feet wear flats.  If it's hard to breathe with your
head jammed up your ass then pull it out!

I was just gonna snip all the rest, but then that lovely little bit
caught my eye.  Since you're having such trouble thinking clearly
today I'll give you a hint:  "twisting as it is is stupid" does not
have nearly the same meaning as "twisting is stupid".
