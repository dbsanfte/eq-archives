Ok, I remember that.  Back in the good old days.  There was a workaround
even then.  If, for example, you were trying to raise live Froglok
faction by killing undead frogs in LGuk, and you hit bottom on your dead
frog faction (which stopped your live faction from going up, as you
explain above), you could allow the dead frogs to kill you, which would
(apparently) raise your dead frog faction above minimum so you could get
some more faction hits for a while.  A painful technique, to be sure,
there were a few at least who made use of it.
