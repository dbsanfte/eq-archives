As embarrassing as it is, I was 52nd level before I made the connection 
(thanks to a tiny little druid mentioning channeling through an attack to 
root a mob) that I had never put a point in. I did, and the difference in 
my effectiveness, especially in groups, has been astounding. I can now 
take some hits and still root-park mobs and heal while getting whacked 
on.

So, yes, put a point into it ASAP. It goes up real fast.
