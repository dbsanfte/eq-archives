Might give that one a try.

Recommended levels above 50 are out of the question for me, as I found out
when I tried to equip my Tae Ew War Maul.  The guide said that for
recommended levels above 50, it's also a required level.  Had never heard
that before.

Alas, soloing against plaguebone thieves, more than half my damage is coming
from chibi-nukes (not counting IoN, which is waaay too unreliable).  I'm
whilffling six out of seven hits, so I can't afford anything that reduces my
mana, unless you can figure a way to up my hit ratio to what it used to
be...  Maybe I've taken the "stats don't matter" crowd too seriously, and
neglected agi too much?

Sounds like an "in the future" thing.  Personally, I'm tempted to bit the
bullet and get a Fier'dal fletcher to make me a blessed faydark thunderbolt.
I hate to do that, because I'm still torqued about cultural fletching.....

Hmm, I'll probably stick with the Cougar Claw, then.  30hp goes by in a hit
for me...

I'll add that one to my list.  Pass the Spider Fur Collar to my baby monk.

@_@  expensive.....  especially for a soloer.

Sounds like the DW helm will have to stay for a while, then.

176 in fletching, because it doesn't have any cultural recipies (beats head
against the wall).

Sounds like a good idea.

... indeed.  Well, we do have a Tier'Dal smith...

Indeed.  Looks cool, set against the gold of the deepwater, as well.

Picked up a Spider Fur Cloak in the meantime.  White Bear Pelt looks good,
though.

Oddly enough, I have yet to see those in the bazaar....

Sounds like the Acrylia Plate is the way to go, then.

Well, I could always pull it back off my bard.

Indeed.

Thanks for the advice, alot of it seems quite expensive, but I'm sure a few
days committing genocide in mistmoore will.... raise my faction with Ring of
Scale, yeah, that's it...
