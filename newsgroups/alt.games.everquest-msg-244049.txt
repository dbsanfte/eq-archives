 From the other responses and my experience on our computers at home, 
I'd say you have one of the lucky winning combinations of hardware, 
drivers, etc. that wasn't tested before this was released. Assuming no 
other recent changes in your system, I'd say that yet again you will 
need to go on the great driver hunt.

While I normally loathe to send anyone to the Sony tech support forum, 
if you post your system information there you'll likely have somebody 
suggest a specific driver set and source for it that will get you back 
on your feet. I've had luck there in the past. If nothing else, it's 
free and you have nothing to lose at this point.
