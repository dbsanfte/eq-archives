Okay, I just read on a message board about how somebody's guild went
to raid the Plane of Fear for the first time, didn't really know very
much about the zone, and the poster said it turned out to be a 9-hour
corpse run (with most members dying multiple times).  Is this unusual
or is this something that can happen often at high levels?  (I don't
have a clue since I don't have any high-level characters).

Also, do people with high-level characters generally spend a lot of
time in one playing session (like 8+ hours straight) or does that vary
from player to player?

Thanks in advance,
