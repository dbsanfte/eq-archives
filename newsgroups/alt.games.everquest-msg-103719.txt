I recently started playing EQ in January, and my first character (a Vah 
Shir Beastlord) is up to lvl 35.  I'm getting bored hunting in the same 
spots that everyone else is (went down to the planet after moon got 
repetative) and I've hit Crushbone, The Oasis, The Lake of Ill Omen, and 
then more recently Frontier Mountains and then Overthere.  I got bored with  
Overthere and started looking around for places to go, but I can't seem to 
find anyplace with either mobs I can solo that give exp or places that I 
can group in.  Any suggestions?  I really enjoy grouping but other than the 
really populated places it seems like no one is ever looking for group.  I 
seem to get beat up pretty well trying to take on the blues that I see 
anymore, so I might need to get some better armor...so someplace with okay 
exp but good  money for buying armor might help out.  Any help would be 
greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
