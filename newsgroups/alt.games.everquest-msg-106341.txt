It's possible to transfer from one regular server to another; but I'm
not sure if FV is considered a "regular" server for those purposes. I
know you can't transfer from a red server (one of the Zeks) to any
other. That said, surely you jest? It costs $50 to transfer just one
character and you don't take any of your gear or money with you. Why on
earth would you want to pay to transfer a character you could remake in
a few hours at most? It's hard for me to believe it was that difficult
for you to reach level 6 (and, if it was, heaven help you when you hit
54!) =P
