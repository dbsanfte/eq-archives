Has anyone had trouble with a collection mission in the last day
or so?  My group took on a "collect 21" in Rujarkian last night,
and only 13 dropped the whole time we were there, including the
30 minute post-failure period.

The last several collects I've been on have been a total breeze,
but this one kicked our asses.
