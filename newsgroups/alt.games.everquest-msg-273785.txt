I posted all relevant details concerning the decision, there's nothing more 
to know about it than you already know.

I don't have much respect for someone who follows the letter of the law and 
then acts like an ass when presented with evidence that there are other 
social conventions that apply out of common courtesy. Given your comment 
about your unwavering moral standards, I'm suprised at your ability to 
confuse morality with legality. Or are you saying that morality is defined 
by law?

Why would you assume that I would assume that?

An exception based on a judgment call is just that, a judgment call. If this 
is how you define "favoritism", fine. I "favor" the ability to use 
discretion and judgment, thank you. :)
