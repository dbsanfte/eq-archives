Not if you want them to actually read your post, no.  You feel that 
people who can't be bothered to wait for an assist call are going to 
read a 200 line document on why they should?

Perhaps out of say, 40 people, 10 will read it, of which say 1 is 
someone who never waits for assist.  And it won't change their mind, 
because they aren't jumping the gun early because they don't know they 
shouldn't.

The other 30 will be most of the ones who don't even know they should be 
waiting, but they didn't read the post for the same reason they don't 
know they should be waiting - EQ is a game, and they only pay attention 
to it *inside* the game, at the instant it's going on.

Nominate someone to spot early engagers, and talk to them one-on-one 
in-game.
