Yes, "night blindness"...as in, they don't have infravision, so can't see in
the dark.  They always need a torch, lantern, lightstone or something like
that, or they'll always keep bumping into things like walls and monsters and
stuff....  Since it is night about half the time in the game, that can be a
significant handicap, though I actually see it as a minor one (only once was
it bad enough to make be log out and time my return for sunrise).

All my favorite characters are Human, Barbarian, or Erudite.
Even after nearly a year of playing and exploring, I still haven't learned
my way around the Wood Elf city (a frustrating maze of tree-houses,
dangerous ledges, and hazardous walkways).

They are right about the Bard... it's not an easy class to play, and it
would be far better to start out with another class to learn the basics.

Since Faun's roleplayed before, a ranger probably would be a pretty decent
first-time choice for her to learn the game's mechanics.
