Charm fight with ravens in PON the exp solo is awesome, COK works best with
pet haste and healing you can power thru ravens and trees with ease and can
manage to do about 4 or 5 mobs before you need to rest for mana.. also when
your ensnare goes off and you have the time move out of range and cast invis
and resnare and recharm the raven.. keeps things under control when charm
breaks. Also be well aware that some ravens in PON are too high for COK
charming and CHA is a plus so add that with items prior to charming..
