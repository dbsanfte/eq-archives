I went and did it now ;)  I got my new card. ( At least I ordered it. )  I
am getting the Geforce3 200 Ti. it was basicly as fast as I beleive in
researching it as fast as my poor old PIII can handle, it can handle from
all the reading I have done all the games I care about. I got it at a pretty
good price, and by the time I replace this system, some time this year, I
won't feel like I dumped good money after bad. I am not very interested in
the very very newest games. I just want something that works with Windows
XP. I will re-format my HDD when I install it and start from scratch. With
any luck it should take care of all I need it to do. I don't have Lucin, so
its not a concern. Thank you for everyones input, and advice, It should be
here in a couple days, then I will be good to go..
