Why do you care what we think? Unless you are a troll of course.

Why don't you just pay someone to play the game for you?
Why not go ahead and buy a level 60 with everything
equipped?

Its a game. If you buy 'virtual' items in a game you are a pathetic
loser with more money than sense. But that's just my opinion.
Its your money spend it any way you like.

Its really true a fool and his money are soon parted.
