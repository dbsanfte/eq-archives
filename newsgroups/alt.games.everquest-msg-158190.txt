Actually I was just thinking that if the loot is noticeably better
deeper (I've been in deep only a couple times, and not for all that
long either time) it might be easier to get a bunch of folks from
the guild to come in and build faction as prelude to trying out the
war, which I think would be great fun even if it turns out that all
of the post-war NORENT turn-in rewards are crap no matter how many
NPCs you keep alive.  That "Gnoll invasion" after Barducks is killed
is the kind of thing I've always thought MMORPGs would be all about,
not 45 minute zerg fests against some nigh-unkillable beastie where
the greatest risk is that somebody will doze off IRL and be injured
falling out of their chair.  Also, from what I've heard of the
invasion I think my guild could handle it quite well.  We've got a
ton of 55+ Druids, a few Clerics, a couple Warriors, some Paladins,
a couple Rangers, 3 L60 Enchanters, at least one epic Mage, 3 56+
Shamans, not sure who all else actually, but plenty of people, most
of whom seem to be high level casters (we've even got one manaburn
Wizard).  Anyhow, "protecting" the settlement in JP looks doable
even for a chaotic crew like us, heel the Druids could probably do
most of the work as semi-coordinated soloers pulling gnolls out of
the settlement and kiting them.

Besides, wtf would my Druid on FV want with some crappy ring of
sorcery when he could get a cool antique ring instead?  :-p
