Yes I did, but I find it boring and pointless, unless I actually care
about the topic.  Been doing this unix things for a wee while.

My question was one about people rather than a techie thing.  Best
answer so far is boredom (actually the only answer really)

I wont be kill filing anyone, but if a post is more than 1/2 page long I
dont read it, dont have the patience.

One point, which I have made above but will summary here - some of the
guys/girls here have been civil and helpful to me in the past.

Taras, good post!

Interestingly this query has got most of the guys I wanted to talk to
together.  Thanks for the time, try to stick to the subject if you can,
I know its hard sometimes.

My opinion, forming still, is its the social contact thing often.  Its
nice to debate, even for little or no reason, but its pointless if there
isnt much thought but just profanity and a pissing contest.

Thanks again.

S.
