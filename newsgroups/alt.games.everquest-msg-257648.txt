If mages have the ability to return your mana through mana "heals", I
would say that adds the variability back in.  You just have to rely on
someone else to do it for you, rather than sitting down.

 And frankly, in an argument between which is "easier", medding to get
mana or convincing some other bloke to give you mana, I'd just throw up my
hands, because honestly, neither is a huge hardship.

Yes, it does impact the interaction, and the immersion.  But it doesn't
dumb down the game.  Which, if you recall, was your first argument. This
whole "you should just go play NWN" argument is a new tangent.

Besides, they are interacting with their group or raid...that still
qualifies it as an MMORPG.

Pffft, you are very wrong about this. Has nothing to do with not wanting
to interact with other people.

Most people want to play a game with other *nice* people.  They don't want
to play a game with mean people.  Kill stealers are mean people. If we can
force kill stealing to go away, we can turn mean people into potential
nice people.  People we can interact with and whose eyeballs we will not
want to gouge out.

Because at the end of the day, most nice people are just folks who would
be mean people if they could get away with it.  Many a kill stealer is a
"nice person" to someone else who they haven't KSed yet.

You started out arguing that EQ2 was a dumbed down game, and you've
switched to it being an antisocial game.  Don't switch arguments until
we've settled the first, plz. :P

Hehehehe, well, yes, since there is absolutely no PvP in EQ2, that is a
fitting label.
