head.

And Pulpfish knows from personal experience.  He was unable to effectively
play EQ and had to quit (or so he says).  Now he spends time reading the
boards and crying on his keyboard because he couldn't handle the game.  He
tends to lash out at others that are trying to do better, though.

Where's my favorite ShammyMageRogue.  This guys weak compared to him (it?).
