Oh golly gosh, I do beg your pardon, your lordship. Very literal aren't you.
Let me spell this out to you,  I was reacting to, albeit a non serious
remark in the first place, the comment about 'bleeding euro's'  saying that
it was unfair to lump a large completey different group of countries as the
same type of people.

Why, because I am not one of the prudish British stereo type, I know that
they exist, but that's another comment that was marking all brits as that
type of person, which ain't true, and plainly a stupid thing to write.

And laugh, oh yes! I am laughing alright, there is a huge grin on my face
right now.

PS

From your Email address, are we to believe that you are British yourself?
If so I find it kinda odd that you are arguing at all.  Sounds to me like
you are a homesick interloper.  More fuel for the flamethrower  muhahaha.
