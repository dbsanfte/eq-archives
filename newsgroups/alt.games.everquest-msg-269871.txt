You can't disregard inflation. I miniscully twinked my mage (He got to 
borrow my velium hp rings, I bought him a robe, leggings, mana, a 
weapon, and an off hand slot item for 100pp and he borrowed my boots 
(golden eff, very nice for a lowbie)) and went from 1-35 in a playing 
week. (7 sessions of 2-4 hours each. less than 25 hours played). At that 
point he had a nice high int, made very efficient use of mana, had a big 
mana pool and hp pool for his class/level.  Why? Cause I had bought him 
gear my 50 enchanter would have drooled over in the bazaar with just the 
money he had made leveling to 35.


For one of the asian RPG's, Final Fantasy I would compare with Early 
(pre kunark ZEM's) EQ xp grinding, but more areas to go to. (and it's 
scary how you get paldul caverns level packing in zones when there are 
generally 3-6 great places  (and more 'acceptable' places) to go xp at 
any given level. Example, at our level most people are in one of the 
jungles near a city named Kahzam. so a /search and it finds 130 people. 
Most of which are within 30 seconds run of the zone line (not that you 
train much in this game.. when things go south you either scrape by or 
die), scrabbling for pulls due to the mass overpopulation.
We on the other hand are in a deserted dungeon, fighting things that we 
have to take care on (they are right at the top of what we can kill at 
our level, but they give fabulous xp... and as we get 2-3 levels that xp 
will continue as they start xp chaining (bonus for killing tough mobs 
quickly), but we are 6 of about 15 people in the zone, and the others 
are a group 20 levels higher doing deeper things in the dungeon, and 3 
very high levels camping or farming various things. The best parts are, 
we are actually closer to a town than the jungle... if we get a wipe 
out, we can come back very easily, and we are getting much better loot.

Note that I understand levels above  60 become a horrific grind, but 
then that's from people who are complaining while grinding through the 
20s. (A guy we had in our linkshell was complaining about the 60+ and 
also how slow xp was around his current job's level. (20). Mind you he 
had just got 3 levels in 5 hours, so I take the 60+ complaining with a 
grain of salt.)

The biggest 'problem' with Final Fantasy most people would have is that 
it makes EQ1, pre-kunark look 'solo friendly'. Meaning that if you don't 
make friends well, you end up sitting around looking for a party... a lot.
