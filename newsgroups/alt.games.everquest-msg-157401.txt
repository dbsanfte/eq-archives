Somebody sent me a tell the other day on my wizard.. "can you port me plz?"
I replied back, "no"
And he said "sorry?!"

I mean wtf!  He was genuinally surprised that I was telling him no... I
didn't ask for a ridiculous amt of money to try and put him off, or give
some feeble excuse...  I just told him outright no.

If I don't wanna do it, then no amount of plat will change that fact.  I
generally rez people when im sitting in a zone doing nothing, or if I ever
find myself in a noob zone, but if *im* going somewhere or in a rush, I
couldnt care less what you offer, sorry im not stopping for anybody.

If im pulling so fast that my cleric is <50m (pre epic days) and somebody
needs a rez.. tough.  Need an aego?  Better group with a 60 cleric then!  If
im FM, pulls are going slowly or the zone is busy then I dont mind a few
mins of downtime (which I have n control over anyway)... but whilst theres 5
peope in Velks..  don't expect me to cast anything other than self heals !

I've been offered 1k in GD/EW to go rez somebody in CC and turned it down..
sorry but if im busy, im busy.  Whether 1k is a lot of money or not, it
makes *ZERO* difference to my character or game lifetyle

its not about money, its about time.. my time

-m  <-  paid 250pp for a single batwing the other day because i was in a
hurry (was actually logged on the wiz too at the time)
