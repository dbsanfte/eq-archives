Herein lies part of the question you are missing . The old groucho marx
problem . I do not want to belong to any country club that would have me.
Groups may indeed want druids but good groups dont.

the best exp group is probably still
cleric
chanter or bard
paladin or sk
3 dammage classes (in order rogue ,ranger , magician , necro
,beastmaster,monk , wizard,sk,pally , warrior)

A very nice aoe group will be
2 clerics
2 chanters
2 wizards or magicians

Good duos also ignore druids
shaman + tank

To answer the question . The worst class to be atm is probably a warrior .
Closely followed by druid. Then maybe monk . Wizards,necroes , and magicians
also seem to have real trouble finding groups .
