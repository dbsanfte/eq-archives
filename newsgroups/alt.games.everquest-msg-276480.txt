 think the quiet is a function of all the new games people have gone
off to play.  They'll be back, they always come crawling back to EQ.
I'm guilty of that one, I can't seem to shake my Evercrack addiction.

Agree. I  left EQ1 when EQ2 came out, and I returned just last week.
But for me the reason was that I am one a wireless DSL conenction which
really is horrible when trying to download patches, additional material
etc and the delay really inhibits group play so I usually solo. I
finally got sick of the aggrevation, copied the files to a DVD. I'll
probably go back to EQ2  if 1) they ever run in fiber optics into this
techo blacohole, so i can get connected via a cable modem, or 2) move
to a location where I have access to it.  *DiectWay* is not a good way
to play EQ2. But surprisingly I have NO problems with EQ1. The
additional material and patches downloads just fine.
