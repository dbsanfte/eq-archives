#1 keep everyone sowed. After that I'd say the most important buff
to keep on the tanks and meleers is any kind
of speed/haste buff. After that most stat buffs make only small
differences until the very high level ones that add hundreds of
points. But if have the mana put AGI, DEX, STA, STR buffs on
the tanks/meleers.

After battling in any area/group you can tell after a while who you
should be buffing:
Who is tanking? Give them all the melee buffs.
Rogue in the group? Give them DEX and STR.
Anyone have a weapon that Procs? Give them DEX.

But always make sure you have enough mana to slow and
debuff the mobs during battle. If you are pulling at a fast pace
and are running low on mana just concentrate on keeping the
speed on the melee people and debuff the mobs.
