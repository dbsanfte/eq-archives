Tell you what Kaev. :)  Once I get myself CA3 and LR5 I'm going to see if
I can duo in HoH with Rakyn (I know I can already tank with a full
group, but I want to do it without the backup).  No idea how I'll do, but
that's the goal.  If we can duo that without obscene downtime, will you
concede that it's intelligent to build a Ranger as a tank (if that is how
someone wants to play it)?  

And I agree that HP > AC, simply becuase our damage mitigation is shown to
suck.  AT my point in the game, tho, I suspect that CA3/LR5 > HP > AC.
