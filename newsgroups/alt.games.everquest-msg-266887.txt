Well, aside from a notch or 2 on the processor, we're pretty similar.
Your card beats mine cold, however.  I started with the "medium"
settings for video, and then started turning on selected options
(heat, lens flare, flora, proper texture sizes for my card.  Started
at 1024, upped to 1280 with no appreciable slowdown.

I'm running Win98 with drivers that are bout a year old, and it is
pretty smooth and sweet.  I'm wish I could help more with your
problem, but heck if I know.  Hope you get it sorted out.
