You gotta be more specific.  Maybe you're talking about wizards being
resisted too much (though my 40 is doing pretty well).  My enchanter is much
more powerful than any warrior.  Clerics are damned powerful too.  Druids
are seriously underrated and certainly shaman are powerful.  I won't go on
with every caster but hopefully you see what I mean.

If you mean that there should be more high level places where a warrior
isn't REQUIRED, well, I'll agree with that for now.  Supposedly the moon is
going to be less warrior-dependent but I haven't hunted much there yet so I
couldn't say.
