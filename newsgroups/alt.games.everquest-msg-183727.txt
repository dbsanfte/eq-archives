It's not perminant, but it's instant cast and infinate charges, and you
don't have to wear them.  It wears off after 30 minutes just like normal
sow so if you go in a dungeon it will wear off.

It's also slower than any sow you can get, I understand it's a sow as if
it were cast by a lv 1.  

It's the Ancient Cyclops Quest.  really really rare spawn lv 30+ in
South Ro or 40 ish in OOT.  It's also hotly contested.  I spent weeks
camping it with my enchanter in both places, longest quest I've ever
done.

Or you can buy a similar item, but not instant cast for 5k from a
merchant in SolA tboots.

It's no longer worth it.  Once you get to 51 you can start spending AA
points on Run which works indoors and never wears off.  Until then you
can easily buy sow potions wich are faster, and you'll spend much less
time/money getting them than the jboots/tboots.
