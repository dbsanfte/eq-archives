Being a relative newbie to the game, I used to think that my grouping
skills sucked.  LDoN, however, has taught me otherwise.  I often find
myself having to instruct other players on how to play their classes
and preserve mana.  I can't tell you how many times I've encountered
people that don't /assist, taunt, make a hot key for heals, pull
trains, nuke until oom (I've even encountered a cleric that does
this), stand around instead of med during mele, etc...  I've also
encountered a lot of "cowboys" that like to get ahead of the puller
and pull trains.
