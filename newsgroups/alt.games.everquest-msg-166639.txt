Hmm, ok, you got me there.  If the reference is truly only for the
bazaar, then I would suggest it is fairly representative of pure
capitalism.  I have not been to the bazaar as I do not have SoL,
however I assume it is at least as open as the tunnel in EC to Nro.
This "market" in EC was very indicative of capitalism; anyone was
allowed to participate regardless of class, race, or religion.  Items
were offered for trade or purchase including player made and hard to
find.

No taxes were imposed, no levies laid, and no tarrifs paid, and no fee
to the feudal lord.   All in all, a pretty shining example of
capitalism.
