You will not evade me, cyrakis@yahoo.com (Cyrakis):

The above is the main reason I think Lance's  idea of turning wizards
into a better snaring class isn't right.

Makes sense.

>Give wizards a mana drain spell. Let them suck mana off mobs.

Zhey alreddy haf un...

>Root of al'kabor - An al'kabor spell worth casting!

I take it Al'kabor isn't all he's cracked up to be? :)

>additional crowd control:
>Freeze- encase target in block of ice (same effect as mez basically)

Good one, except for when those NPC wizards cast it on you :)

>Targetable PB AE. Let wizard target tank, and cause a point blank ae

 A bit odd.

>Offensive teleports- let wizard cast yonder on a target basically.
>Probably causes a train, but may give the group time to escape.

Point. I like this one and the offensive teleport.

>Radiation spells - a buff that causes an AE dmg effect to everyone
>getting near the target. Think of it as flames leaping off the buffed

>hit the buffed guy or not.

I like this better than the plain targetable PB AE idea.

>Elemental protection - Give wizards some kickass elemental resistance
>buffs that they can give to other players.

Maybe, but it seems more like a magely thing. Wizards use the elements
for damage, while the magician is the one who is more in control of
them. And neither of them belong to the classes working to protect
against elements.

>Chargeable staves and wands - wizard pours mana into a device and uses
>it to increase mana pool (different take on spell scrolls)
>
>Elemental mastery spells (castable on others):

>Power-up -  Buff that increases base mana pool of others.

This really seems to be leaning towards mage and enchanter stuff.

>Aimable yonder- yonder in the direction you are facing
>
>Aimable group yonder - take the group with you

I think these might be a bit *too* powerful in certain zones.

>More stuns, at lower levels

Stuns are nice but also draw aggro, and there are plenty others who
should be doing stunning instead of dishing damage.

>Expanded o'keils line (boring, but hey)

Go for it! It seems that stuff stacks with the mage and druid damage
shields (or maybe that was before this patch? :) Had groupmates the
other day telling me my thorns didn't cancel it)

>Divination- give wizards a spell line that will give more detailed
>information about a target. I.e. hit points, faction it's part of,
>resistances, agro behavior, etc.

Not sure about this one.

>Mind's eye - gives perfect vision under any conditions, including
>rain.

I can live with that... :)

>Summon monster - should be a mage spell, but I thought I'd mention it
>here. Cool way to find mobs in an overcrowded area. Can easily be

A 'negative' CoH?

>Summon Demon - Wizard summons a fiend of hell and sets it lose upon
>his enemies. Basically a pet that burns itself out and is not
>controllable. It is not like a pet, in that it can agro on anyone,
>including the wizards party.

*skeptical*

>AE Mana blast - Spell that does damage to enemy casters available
>mana. A mana nuke. Does not do physical damage at all.

I don't think I like this one either.

>Spell trap - wizard casts an explosive rune on an area. First mob
>entering area sets off explosion. (mechanism already exists in game
>too, it's used in the spell sentinel)
>
>Spell trap line - you could extend this into a whole line of spells

Could be fun!
