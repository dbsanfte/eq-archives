Sorry, I should have elaborated.  In my experience (and that is very
subjective, I'll admit it), there is less of the problems in the
paragraph above because of the flagging system.  Part of it is merely
that there simply ARE fewer people in these zones; part of it,
however, seems to be that the people most likely to KS and trash-talk
have fewer friends and are less likely to make it through the trials.
However, I'll admit that this type of cause-and-effect is difficult to
prove - it is merely an hypothesis.

Incompetence at high levels is a complaint that has been made numerous
times by people with whom I've grouped.  It's my theory that SoE put
in the flagging system to curb this (it can't ever be removed
entirely).  Now, SoE's idea was not a good one - but part of it have
merit.

Levels may be the only valid delimiter for access to zones, but I
hesitate to advocate use of levels in this way.  It does not take into
account the exceptional player who is able to make do with less. 
Nevertheless, if it came down to a choice, I would have to support
such an implementation by SoE.
