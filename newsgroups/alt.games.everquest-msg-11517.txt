With any luck, a fair wind, and following seas, I should ding 34 with my
warrior either tonight or tomorrow.  Then I'll be staring the dreaded 35
sqare in the face. I've spent the last couple levels at the mountain
giant fort in FM, but the action can be too slow there. (Though the loot
is good.)
  I did 30 on the ledge in OT, and a lot of the mobs were still red, so
I'm thinking that's one viable option for 35, since most everything
there should still give xp. (the loot is total crap, but I really don't
care for hell levels)  I really want a place where I can get into some
constant action groups and batter my way through that godforsaken level
as quickly as possible and get on with my life.  Hence the subject line:

   Where did you spend 35, and if you had it to do all over again, where
would you go to max out your xp/hour to get out of that hell hole?
