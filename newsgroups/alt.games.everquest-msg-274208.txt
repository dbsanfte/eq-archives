Golly, tcells, did you miss the first post in the thread?

I don't need to - I saw the reason cited by Blizzard quoted in the
first post of the thread.

Cite, please?

Cite, please?

Happily married for 13 years, thanks.

I own my own business.

On the contrary, I realize it perfectly well. In the case under
discussion, the ruling authority (Blizzard) deemed it offensive.


>You lack the maturity to realise just what a liar you are when you say "I

That's not why I'm arguing. I'm arguing because I enjoy cutting up
inane little dimwits. That'd be you, in case you didn't catch it.

I'm making no claims whatsoever about real world usage. If it's on
Blizzards banned list, then anyone who is apt to cry like a baby when
he gets busted certainly shouldn't use it in WoW. Neither should
anyone who cares about being a good WoW citizen.


>now just for a little more info, it was not him typing in pussy 
>which got him banned

That's in direct contradiction to the material which Dennis himself
posted.

e.g.: "you guys gave me a 72 hour suspension without warning for using
the word pussy?", and "The Obscene Vulgar and Inappropriate policy(s)
has been violated".


>you truely are wrapped up in your own self importance.

Not at all. It's just that I'm singularly unimpressed by *your* self
importance. You apparently believe that you can dictate to Blizzard
how they run their game.
