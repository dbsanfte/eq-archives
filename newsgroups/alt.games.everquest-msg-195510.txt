Sorry, didn't mean to come off as snippy.  :-p
It's just that so many of these posts are getting so long, heh.

Sure, but they aren't learning their class's strengths in a group
context either.  And I find strengths to be far more important than
weaknesses and limitations.  The group that reinforces each other's
strengths accomplishes so much more than any other group, including
the group whose focus is on covering one another's weaknesses.
There is an implicit realization of this in most of the common
tactics you see in the game, and unusual tactics that get good
results seem invariably to revolve around creative ways to bring
everybody's strengths to bear on the situation.

Hmm, ok.  I haven't seen that particular misbehavior.  But it doesn't
surprise me.
