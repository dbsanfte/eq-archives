True, unless he's speaking of weapons with bonus damage (i.e. disease,
or fire, or bane vs. undead, or ...), in which case the bonus damage
does indeed act as if it improved the weapon's stats.  One caveat to
that is that the non-bane bonus damage can be resisted, so a 10/25
weapon with 3 Fire damage could be 10/25, 11/25, 12/25, or 13/25 on
any particular hit depending on whether the target resists some or all
of the damage.
