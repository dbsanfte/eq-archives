Brr... The coldest I've ever been in my life was -15 C, in Anchorage at 
Christmas. Later on we went to a small town near Mount McKinley, and 
they told us we were lucky, as they had hit -40 the week before.

We were well ready for the cold and the snow on that trip, but we forgot 
to account for only having about 5 hours of daylight. We ended up 
playing cards a lot...
