Think so?

If I make any dwarf or gnome from now on (assuming more isn't added
before release), I will be doing the very exact same thing I did in
the stress test, ending up at exactly the same level, with exactly the
same gear. And I don't really have any option, unless I run to the
human or NE start spot instead.

EQ's PnP was mortally wounded by the fact it doesn't actually reflect
how the players played in the first place (players tended to respect
camp spots in EQ regardless of the "first hit rule", not always but
most the time). WoW isn't going to give that option, and the rule it
chose to enforce isn't the one the players came up with on their own
in a free environment. That suggests trouble on the horizon.

Mind stop repeating that bullshit? At no point did I suggest these
things didn't happen in EQ, and its annoying that you're insinuating
that I did.

Nor did I say it didn't, as I just said. But just because EQ has a
negative doesn't mean other games are free to have said negative as
well.

Way to snip all the context. Tim wondered why no one tries to copy
DAoC. I merely illustrated some history.
