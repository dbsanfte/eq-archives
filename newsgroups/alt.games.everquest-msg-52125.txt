Maybe it's just psychological cause i didn't number crunch but while
fighting sisters of erollisi from 14 to 16 my pet sure seemed to do
better damage after giving him a rusty halberd earned on the first
kill.  Definitely too heavy to carry around to give it, but if it's free
and right there why not.  Too heavy and not worth enough to bother to
take back to sell when you can fill that inventory slot with another
purity belt.
