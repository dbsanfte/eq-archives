Actually it does (or it used to) I remember the days before kunark where
the 50 lv wizard farmers would sit at camps in LGuk litterally for days,
handing off to thier farmer buddies.  No one could get certain items
legit on my server because of one big farmer guild.  Admittedly it's not
that bad these days as there are more places to farm than people.  But
it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

UO SUX0RS - this may be part of the reason.
