Well, after keeping my ear to ground, I think I've found what might be a
common factor... all the affected users use Windows XP, and all are on a
dialup.  Lenny and I are certainly in that boat.  The two fixes are to
1) delete custom UI files or 2) Have a guild or trusted friend from a
different location log in and walk your character out of the zone they
are in.  I deleted my UI files, but no help.

   So, it looks like we are stuck with option #2.  I've emailed Sony
using the "Contact your GM" link.  With luck I won't get ignored.  But
if I'm not lucky... well... /sigh.  I don't really have any RL friends
that play EQ... the one that did, well, is at a work site and doesn't
have his computer with him.  So I can trust someone with my passwords
(same problem on all 3 accounts), or say screw it and either delete my
mains and start over,  or just quit.  I'm not really ready to do that
last two, and I'm not real happy about the first one.  I mean, there
*are* people whom I trust in the game (you know who you are)... But
technically doing this could get me banned.

We have one other thing we can try... Lenny still has his ME Windows
machine around... we can hook that up, and try to walk our characters
out with that.  He's at work right now, but we might try it when he gets
home.  Except that he took out the hard drive that has all his eqfiles
in and put it in the new computer... hmmm... that might not be a good
option.

I'm really, really frustrated right now.
