This is retarded to beyond belief.

You can scroll the text back up and do a /report. I personally would have
taken it further if possible with another GM or CS. HoH trials are not
completed by many. Can't be too hard to search database for who possess same
ring and question them how they got it and remove item from the retard who
stole it.

We had this long while back in NToV. We were the only guild in there. Killed
Aaryonar and had announced loot when the servers leading twat (a gnome mage)
deliberately trained in some mobs and tried to ninja the loot while we
fought. GM was called and removed aforementioned Gnome from Norrath without
any need for proof of his actions quite simply cos he wasn't part of our
guild and had no business being there.

Sounds like the GM lurking on your server that day was a prize fucknut
moron. Never ceases to suprise me the greed of players and the stupidity of
GMs.
