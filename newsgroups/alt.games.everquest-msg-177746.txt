HUSH, you! :P  Personally, both drive me crazy.  Scrolling 300 lines of 
text to see 1 line bugs the hell out of me, but I delete it and move on.  
Finding a comment that sounds interesting but refers to who the hell 
knows what irks me, and continues to irk me for a few minutes after I'm 
past it, as I wonder what I just missed.
