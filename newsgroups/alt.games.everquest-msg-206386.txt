Around Halloween last year, Werewolves were popping up in WC (Greater,
Lesser and regular Werewolves) at certain times of the day (RL day, not game
day. I think they only spawned about 2 to 4 times in a 24 hour period) and
had unique No Drop items on their corpses, most of them class specific. I
went there as my Magician (killed two or three Lesser Werewolves, but got
killed by a Greater and a regular Werewolf near the Druid Ring) and got a No
Drop cloak off one of the corpses. I don't have the stats written down, but
its called Cloak Of The Mind and my Magician is still wearing it today.
(Icon is a black cloak)

On Halloween, two DE GMs and a Gnome or Halfling NPC (I forget which) showed
up. The DE GMs told a story which led to a quest, and the Halfling was
giving Gift of Zev items to anyone who gave her food (I gave her a slice of
Birthday Cake). Unfortunately, the group I was with didn't figure out which
zone we were supposed to go to (It was in LOIO, and we went to Swamp Of No
Hope and Innothule Swamp first), and by the time we arrived, there weren't
many mobs left to kill and a lot of KSing was going on. The mobs were
black-blue drakes called Darkwing Drakes, or something like that. (Looked
sort of like those drakes in Neriak, only black-blue instead of gray or
purple or whatever color they are) You were supposed to collect items (the
creatures' body parts, I believe) dropped by the drakes and hand them in to
an NPC that had spawned in return for unique items.

Rumor was that there was also supposed to be a dragon loose in LOIO or
another zone at the same time this was going on, but I never saw it or heard
anything about it, so it probably WAS just a rumor.
