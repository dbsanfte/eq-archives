You were doing well until this point. Monk taunt sucks, horribly, in
every situation, compared to every tank class.

They do have the advantage that they can pick which target they want
to pull out of a group. Dark the one you want, FD and the rest will
wander back while the snared one stands there just waiting to be
peeled. Combine that with an insta-click invis item and it's hard to
beat a high lvl SK for pulling. SKs also get snare. They do admittedly
tend to die a bit more than monks, especially when splitting casters. 
It takes a shaman/SK duo a bit longer to kill stuff than with a monk
but it's worth it imo. Plus, I can DoT with an SK in the group and not
worry about tanking the entire fight.
