what lol!!!!

Rangers are the best they've ever been at 50+ !!!

>and rangers for snare and meleeing, cos they arnt ideal tanks.

Why do they have to tank?  Lets see.. they can root, snare, buff, nuke, good
melee daage, slow a mob

Grouping with a chanter doesn't make my STR and STA 255, and resists  200+..
being with a bard does.  When it comes down to it, any CC is highly desired,
and when I used to hunt in Seb I would easily take a bard then sit around
waiting for a chanter

> Druid only gets in a group for snares or evacs,

As much as I hate that druids are gods of soloing, gods 1-50, and still damn
good 51-60...  they root, they snare, they buff, they can give CLARITY that
stacks with chanter and bard mana! (PotG), they can do big nuke damage, they
can dot, they can port, they can evac, they can track.. they are great
healers
