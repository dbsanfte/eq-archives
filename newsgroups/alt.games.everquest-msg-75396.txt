Was so looking forward to Luclin for the new content and graphics. Press
release pointed out that my P3 700 256mb ram and Gforce2 GTS 32mb Dr would
be more than sufficient.

How wrong they were!

Lag a plenty on the moon. No probs switched off all models.. still lagged
terribly. Gave up on luclin and when back to old world. Couldn't believe the
graphics lag in the old world with VI new gfx system.

What to do.

I upgraded. I bought a new motherboard 266mhz fsb, Athalon1600xp and 768mb
PC2100DDr and a ATA100 40GB HD for faster data transfer rates. Course needed
a new case with uprated PSU

Well the difference was staggering. Not one frame is lost in any zone. Gonna
try it now with models on and see.

In total �18.99 for Luclin �400approx for upgrade parts. Thank you Verant.
�420 (approx 590 US dollars) for 25 new zones and nerfs to standard
attributes to compensate for new att skill ups.
