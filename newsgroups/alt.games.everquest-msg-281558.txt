What you state seems plausible. I know there have been a few instances
in the past of what happens when spell A begins to be cast while Spell
B is already in process of being cast. I remember for a while, before
SONY formally allowed it, it was possible to sequence A casting on B
invis while B was summoning pet, the result was B having a pet while
invis'd.

But to your case, if the caster waited until after you FD, then it
would probably not have cast mez, cuz you were dead. But given that he
cast mez and then you FD,  it seems plausible that the mez stuck.
Ideally the mob should have cancelled the mez after he perceives  you
as dead

Wonder if it works for beneficial spells? have a necro cast dmf and
then fd in the middle of the cast..the mobs would see a floating corpse
lol
