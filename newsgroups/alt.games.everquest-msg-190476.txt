First off consider a Shaman or Druid to back up your Pally. Shaman can
Slow monsters (Slowing is VERY important at the higher levels), and
Druids can cast Damage shields (both classes also offer a wide range
of BUFFS and other utility spells). With your Pally adding healing and
limited rez skills to the mix, you really don't "need" a cleric.

>And if they don't group how do people move them around together? 

Group them...turn on auto-follow...then disband. As long as the
character following doesn't use the movement keys or get out of range,
they will continue to follow. You can even sit/med the following
character. 

As far as "how-to" PL with your 25 pally, the best method would be to
let the lower level character do at least 51% of the damage, then
finish with the Pally. Use the pally for stuns, healing, buffing,
taunting, etc as required. It won't be the most efficient form of
PLing, but it will work.

Also the MOST powerful PLing tool for any casting class is KEI. It
gives insane mana regen at lower levels, lasts 2-3 hours, and can be
purchased in the Nexus/Bazaar/PoK relatively cheap (20-40pp)
