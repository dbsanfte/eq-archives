I can vouch for that...I have seen chanters in PoN charm a tree or
spider, and then watch it mow down others in less time than a full
group will do it.  A guildie of mine went from 58 to 62 in a *WEEK*
doing this.  I've grouped several times with chanters in PoN (I twang
arrows, dot / snare target, root the pet if charm breaks), buff the
pet.  Wicked xp - even with two of us it's about 1% (towards 59 for
me) every 2-3 kills.  Probably more like a blue (4%) in 10 kills,
while the chanter gets about 2% AA each kill

Hell if Verant is going to give us mobs that double for 300-ish, then
why not use them in our favour?
