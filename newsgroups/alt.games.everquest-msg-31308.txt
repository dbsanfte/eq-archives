In your opinion.  And, I'm sorry, your opinion is worth to me exactly
what I paid for it ... Nothing.

Again, I find myself wondering why you felt the urge to insult the
majority of the EQ community.  Surely, you have enough intelligence
and sufficient command of the English language to have understood that
the way you phrased your oringinal posts was hostile and insulting?
Anyone smart enough to boot up a computer could have predicted the
response to your comments ... indeed, you yourself said, (as I recall)
"Let the flames begin" or something to that effect.
