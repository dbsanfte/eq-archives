Hello all,
Husband and I were avid Diablo players until recently, and lets just
say we burned out.  SO, I bought EQ on Saturday and gave it a whirl. 
At first, I was lost and confused.... but with the help of some really
nice people, I manage to get my Wizard (high-elf) to Lvl3 and learn my
way around Felwithe and Kelethin.

Hubby has taken interest and wants to get another CD, so we can play
together.
He REALLY likes the brute melee charactors (played barbarian on Diablo
exclusively) and has decided he wants to play an Ogre. (thinking it's
the strongest)  I know just enough about EQ at this point to realize
he would spawn on the other side of the world, and we'd have a hard
time playing together, as is. (unless I convince him to choose
something in my zone.)

HERE'S MY QUESTION:

Please tell me what two players would make a viable newbie duo, that
includes a strong melee charactor???  Ok guys, take it easy with the
acronyms and tell what you think?  I'm more flexible, but need to
figure this out quick.

I want him to share this new addiction with me. :)
