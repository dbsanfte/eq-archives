In what way are you rude?  Well, in what way are they being rude by
inspecting you?  Do you not understand it is a built in game function and it
is there for a reason?  You are going to get angry and condemn someone for
using something that is available to them and free to use?  There is _zero_
need for them to ask you first, and quite frankly, that is a waste of time
and even MORE of an annoyance.  If you valued politeness, I am sure you'd
have no problem with kindly letting someone use a feature open to them
anytime they wish for any reason.  They pay to play too.  If you don't like
it, turn off the message or walk away.  Do not condemn them for your
selfishness and arrogance.  Sorry, but you are the one with the unpolite
reputation here, at least in my book and I am sure the majority of others.
