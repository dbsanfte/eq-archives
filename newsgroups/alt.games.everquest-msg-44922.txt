They could have given Stonebrunt more potential if the town was an actual
city with a bank, all sorts of tradeskill vendors (NO fletching anywhere on
Odus!) and some more other kind of vendors then the current ones.
Can you even bind non-casters there? Don't think so.

Oh and the bamboo weapons should've been light weight not heavier then most
steel weapons.

These small things alone would have kept my lvl 23 war in the zone instead
of running of to a more decent zone.
I loved the zone for the exp and the good SW corner camp, but when I ran out
of fletching supplies, got killed twice by aggroing greenies in warrens and
became overweight after picking up only a few weapons and had to do a
train-the-greenies run through the warrens again only to spend half an hour
to an hour passing several zones just to get to a bank (paineel still no
option, and Erudin bank is 5 !! zones away) I gave up.
