I was the only person in EK tonight, so I thought I'd try to spawn proon. I
killed broon and droon a few times when i noticed Tarbul earthstrider on
track. I remembered him killing me and decided a bit of payback was in
order. I rooted him (ready to gate if he summoned me like cazel does), hit
him with breath of ro and fixation of ro, resist, resist, resist, and ran
out of mana.

I had kei, he was rooted, and i could keep him that way safely, but i was
very surprised that he seemed immune to fire based spells. I pulled up my
disease dots and killed him that way (eventually!). I had a look on the 'net
but couldn't find any reason why all my fire spells were resisted by this
mob.

Also, in my never ending struggle to get 1hb maxed (142, i think 150 is max
for a druid???), i was in greater wolf form, with firefist and strength
buff, and pounding away on his unresisting treetrunk legs, when i noticed he
could actually regenerate faster than I could hurt him.

He dropped "rain of karana". Does any one know if this is worth anything to
mages (mq maybe?) or should i just destroy it?

Can't wait for LoY, if only for the bank slots!
