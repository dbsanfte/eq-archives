Well, thinks like education, work experience, having a family, having
been offered a job there... Basically, it seems to be set up to
discourage people moving in to look for work, rather than already having
a job offer. Not unreasonable, in the face of it, but not very conducive
to my idea of having a long sabbatical there and look for a job at my
leisure. :)
