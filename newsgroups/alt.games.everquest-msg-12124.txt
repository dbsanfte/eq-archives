While exploring a little in Misty Thicket, while my partner was getting some
spells, Trannik, the Wood Elf Scout encountered an NPC at the base of the
hill with the tower on it just across from the entrance to Rivervale.  He
stands behind some of the broken pieces of the wall on the front left of the
hill (when facing from Rivervale) and is well hidden.  I found him
completely by mistake.

Here is the Log...

[Sat Jun 02 13:44:04 2001] Bidils the Quickhand regards you indifferently --
what would you like your tombstone to say?
[Sat Jun 02 13:44:06 2001] You say, 'Hail Bidils the Quickhand'
[Sat Jun 02 13:44:06 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Why, hello there,
Trannik ! And what brings ya to see little old me? Oh, let me guess! I am
sure it is because ya wish t'buy a good spot of Jumjum and listen to my
[tale]? Oh, quite lovely so! Why else would one well rounded Wood Elf come
to see the great Bidils the Quickhand other than to hear of this rogue's
great adventures?
[Sat Jun 02 13:44:26 2001] You say, 'what tale?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:44:26 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Ahhh. . . I see the
gods have found the time to be now for a good ear to lend to my words! So
long as ya share the Jumjum, I can speak t'ya of the endless adventures and
triumphs of Bidils the Quickhand! Now. . . where shall I begin? Yes! The
[beginning], of course! Indeed, quite lovely so.
[Sat Jun 02 13:44:39 2001] You say, 'what beginning?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:44:39 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Yes, of course I shall
begin at the beginning! No proper tale would begin anywhere other than at
the beginning! You see, good Wood Elf, I was once a humble rogue. . .er,
merchant within this here fair city. Oh, how the Jumjum and gol. . .um,
[merchandise] flowed in then! Quite lovely, indeed, it was. Well then, where
was I?
[Sat Jun 02 13:45:06 2001] You say, 'what merchandise?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:45:07 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Ahhh yes! Those days
were fair indeed. How I do miss them! Of course, that is not to say that
Bidils the Quickhand does not appreciate the eyes and favor of [Bristlebane]
upon him! In fact, it is quite the contrary! I do love a good prank! Yes,
quite lovely so!
[Sat Jun 02 13:45:31 2001] You say, 'who is bristlebane?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:45:31 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Bristlebane, indeed
quite the trickster and with a sense of humor! I bet you could not have seen
that Bidils the Quickhand would have caught the eye of such a dignified
individual, now did ya? Yes, The King of Thieves. . . and merchants finds it
amusing when one takes his [possessions]!
[Sat Jun 02 13:45:51 2001] You say, 'what possessions?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:45:51 2001] Bidils the Quickhand 's eyes grow wide with an
eager, child-like anticipation. ''Oh yes! Upon one of my several adventures
through this great, glorious land of Norrath, I did stumble upon a [lovely
treasure], indeed! Great skill and cunning was used, skill that belonged
only to Bidils the Quickhand, and has yet to be surpassed within this
realm!''
[Sat Jun 02 13:46:24 2001] You say, 'what lovely treasure?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:46:25 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'A lovely gem, far more
beautiful than even the most delicate and furry feet of a halfling lass! It
was larger than my face, and sparkled more than the most pure of Jumjum
catching the rays out of Karana's blessed skies! Indeed, it was a divine
treasure to behold. . . but little then did I know that such a treasure
truly belonged to the King of Thieves. . . and merchants himself! But no,
such truths still would not have [stopped] me!
[Sat Jun 02 13:47:50 2001] You say, 'what stopped you?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:47:51 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Ahh ha! I was not
stopped, and the gem was mine! Right from beneath the nose of Bristlebane
himself did I take it! That was when he noticed me. . . and that is when I
was taken from the humble life of a merchant and placed within the glorious
[Realm of Heroes]! Of course. . . Bristlebane took back the gem. What a
shame. Indeed, quite so.
[Sat Jun 02 13:48:23 2001] You say, 'what realm of heroes?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:48:23 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'The Realm of Heroes,
that is my new home. . . Well, it was. Ahhh, indeed, it is quite lovely! It
is where all who catch the eyes of the gods in favor ascend if their deeds
be true and worthy enough for note! Perhaps one day, Trannik , you shall
rise as well!! Look at Bidils the Quickhand, once a sturdy merchant and now
a [humble servant] and rewarder of deeds!
[Sat Jun 02 13:49:06 2001] You say, 'Humble servant of who?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:49:06 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Yes! Indeed, a humble
servant I am! I complain not for my occupation. . . as I am humble. I
collect [deeds] and make [recognition] of those who have caught the eyes of
the gods. Why the gods do it not themselves, I am lost for answers. . . but,
I do not complain. They are gods, you know. Quite busy! Indeed, lovely so!
[Sat Jun 02 13:49:38 2001] You say, 'what deeds do you collect?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:49:38 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Deeds! Yes, the gods
are quite tricky and intelligent, you know! They have found a way to mark
deeds in the form of a coin! A coin which one who has been fortunate enough
as to accept would give to me. . . or yo one of the [other Heroes] who have
recently come to this land.
[Sat Jun 02 13:50:07 2001] You say, 'what other heroes?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:50:07 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Oh yes! I am not the
only one who has returned to Norrath in search of Heroes! There are many
others, indeed! Although, as the gods, their colors vary. Some are [kind and
gentle] while some are [vile and nasty] beings which ya should watch yer
back for.
[Sat Jun 02 13:50:19 2001] You say, 'who are kind and gentle'
[Sat Jun 02 13:50:19 2001] Bidils the Quickhand sighs heavily, a twinkle in
his eye and a warm smile upon his heavy cheeks. 'Yes. . . none so as Jaylia
the Faithful, as she was so rightfully named. A lovely lass. Tender as a
gentle morning mist. . . Yes. . . Indeed, quite lovely so. An enchanting
creature. . . and as pure as Tunare's good grace itself. Maybe ya should
visit her over in Qeynos an' hear of her adventures!'
[Sat Jun 02 13:50:35 2001] You say, 'who is vile and nasty?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:50:35 2001] Bidils the Quickhand glares and spits on the
ground beside him. '' I know not why some of these. . . villains are called
heroes. It is all part of the plan, I am sure. However, I shall give ya this
warning of one of them, perhaps the most vile of all, and that is Kizrak the
Tyrant, a brutal creature of the Warlord who has quite the taste for
halflings. . . and I mean not in the sense of good grace and kindness!''
[Sat Jun 02 13:51:08 2001] You say, 'what recognition do you collect?'
[Sat Jun 02 13:51:08 2001] Bidils the Quickhand says 'Deeds! Yes, the gods
are quite tricky and intelligent, you know! They have found a way to mark
deeds in the form of a coin! A coin which one who has been fortunate enough
as to accept would give to me. . . or yo one of the [other Heroes] who have
recently come to this land.
