I(ranger) get stinging swarm next circle, I practice my firefly ball

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when

aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
