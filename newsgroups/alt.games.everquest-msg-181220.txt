YMMV, but I have played a mage to level 49 and have a blast with him.

I play the mage when I want to take a break from my rogue. Kind of nice to
have a different perspective.

Also I have no trouble finding groups, but I also like that I can solo. If
no groups want you because "we holding out for a tank" tell em to take you
until the tank shows, you wont be replaced if you are even moderately
capable.

Plus he is a great money maker if I want to go kill HG's. I can kill them
non-stop with the 49 fire pet. Just give him all the armor, weapons (just
because I can), focus items, pull with level 6 nuke and wait for it to die,
slap on the magic dot if I have KEI, nothign if not.
