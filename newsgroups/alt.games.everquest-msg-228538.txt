But don't be offended if the "newbies" don't want it. :)

I regularly roll up a character and play completely untwinked just for 
s&g and I've noticed some players get really upset if "newbs" decline 
buffs and presents.

Plus a lot of players new and old love the novelty of crafting etc, 
they've got half a set of tattered armour and loving it, when suddenly 
someone shows up out of the blue and dumps a set of banded or class 
armour (like lambent) ... and while a wonderful gift it ruins the 
enjoyment they were having with the game, and turns them into treadmill 
runners... because now they aren't going to see an upgrade drop for 30 
levels...

If your going to gift newbies don't overdo it, and don't be offended if 
they say no thanks.

And whatever you do don't breed whiny beggers and buff addicts :)

Nothing is worse than grouping with a level 10-40 X who can't (and 
won't) play without C2 & Temperance.
