Maybe it's a server thing.   Around E'ci, DKP by definition refers to any
system that uses point accumulation to determine loot.   The various systems
that can be included under that title can vary greatly.   The DKP system the
public raids use has none of that extra bullshit.   Just straight out set
number of poitns per raid, (re-evaluated every so often.)  every person
attending gets the same amount, if any kind of a bonus is given (first kill,
flawless victory or whatever) every person attending the raid gets it,
etc...
