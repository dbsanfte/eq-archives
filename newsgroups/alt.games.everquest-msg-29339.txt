No, but it's an easy question.

With very few exceptions, no one is KOS to dwarves (actually, I believe that
there are no exceptions here), almost everyone is KOS to giants and dragons.

You can ally with 2 of the 3 major factions in Velious.  Dwarves are
easiest, obviously, but the armor quests aren't quite as good as dragon or
giant.

I'm allies with dwarves and dubious (non-KOS) to dragons.  Now that I've
been there a while I'm considering trying to work on giant faction by
killing those stupid dwarves.

But then again, with 14 characters there's a LOT of things I'm considering,
or trying to get around to that I just can't seem to, so.... :)
