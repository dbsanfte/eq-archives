Isn't David Navarro a copyrighted name? Sorry...you're going to have to play
by the rules and change it now. Come up with something more
imaginative...try using the name generator in EQ...maybe you'll get lucky
and go through the rest of your life with a name like Rgluck Patnengha...

Sorry I'm late to this thread...I guess I'll start rehashing it just to piss
some of you off who've been saying some really stupid shit over the past
week....

Let's start with you and your "lack of IQ" comments that you seem to
consistently post in every thread along with calling people children...

Come up with some better flames you witless peon. I've seen more intellect
relayed from the hind quarters of a cross eyed camel.

Reporting people for what they name their character is the equivelant of
being the hall monitor in gradeschool. Nobody likes a tattle tale. When I
see some quack headed dumbass with a name that can be considered out of
bounds...I ignore it and go about MY business.

Rest assured if it's extremely vulgar, that person will be dealt with by the
GM's. Not some whiney little bitch that's still whacking spiderlings in
Neriak,  who has made it their responsibility to defend all of Norrath from
the likes of "The person that can't come up with a cool EQ name by my
standards."

God you people here will find the stupidest fucking thing to argue about for
like a decade and a half...

You want to bust people for breaking the EULA when it comes to the naming
policy...then get a job as a GM or shut the fuck up...

btw...

I have a Cleric named Behn Dayde and an Enchanter named Clay Rudy...so fuck
off. Report me and I'll train your ass all over Norrath...
