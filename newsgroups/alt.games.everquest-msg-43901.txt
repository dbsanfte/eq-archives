He brought you the banded boot mold.  You need to get a Large Plate Boot 
mold (it may be named Large Plate Sectional Boot Mold).  These are 
available in Oggok at the vendor that is on the other side of the wall from 
the forge, and also somewhere in Halas if you're not an evil race.

www.eqtraders.com is the place to go for tradeskill information.  
Unfortunately their web page has been down for a couple of days, but keep 
checking back - the forum pages are still working and the Denmother says it 
should be back up today or tomorrow.

perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
