I seperate the two ideas though. The first being allowing official
access of world monetary funds into the system, and the second being
Sony looking to add auto-generated items in the game for cash. There
is a world of difference between the two concepts, the first sound..
the second insane.

Just allowing a person to transfer real-life cash for an item that
allready exists in game does not denote success. I've seen plenty of
newly ebayed characters just fall on their face trying to get in guild
because they never knew the rules nor how to play. So grats on the
best bazaar equipped player money can by, they're still second-class
citizens in the EQ enviornment. If anything.. it makes it a lot better
when it comes to enforcing non-transferal of characters since the
payments for such accounts are tied to a gaming account and when that
changes, which it has to to accomodate a new player, a flag gets
raised and it gets investigated.

And if it can simply enforce the non-transfer of established players
with massive gear and AA to new people... that loss will be infinitely
greater to a new player with cash then allowing them the best bazaar
equipment money can buy for their cash on a new player they have to
level in both levels and AA.

>Why play the game when I can just head back to work and do a little
>overtime? I get better items that way anyway.

But the items you get are no greater than bazaar-level. The no-drop
items that denote success in the high-end zones you'll pretty much
have to play for.

*shrug* i can agree to disagree.

If I might wask, what is your reason for playing EQ?

And lack of anonymity solves a lot of them. People do what they do in
EQ because there are hardly any punitive measures. And the worst of
the punitive measures just means you go buy a game card and take up
another account. In other words, they can't do shit to you. So people
KS and train if they feel like it.. and as you say.. .would do such
things if money were involved. But the act of involving money.. with
the stripping of the anonymity along with tying someone to a specific
gaming account means that person gets banned.. and really stays
banned. They would still have their gaming accounts.. which is the
beauty.. they just don't have access to an EQ account.. ever again. At
the same time.. taking up another character from a buddy means that
they have to receive their friend's identity.. which is something
someone would no more do than they would give a friend their ATM card
and pin number and say 'be nice'.

Its actually a very good point :>. But I would counter that it takes a
certain level of wealth to be able to play EQ in the first place, and
certainly the massive amount of internet access needed is a lot more
expensive in other countries. I don't see some dude out farming rice
paddies playing EQ.

If it involves adding auto-gen'd items into the economy.. its down the
drain.
