I think we are all quite well aware of the fact that you digitally sign your
posts by now.  Personally, I find it quite annoying, can't speak for anyone
else.  I have no desire to digitally sign my posts, if someone feels the
need to impersonate me and make an ass of themselves, so be it.  You do not
have to be a US citizen to use encryption stronger than 128 bits.  You have
to be a US citizen in order to purchase encryption stronger than that from a
US company.  The US has absolutely no say in what companies outside the US
do or sell in the way of encryption, or in what type of encryption a non US
citizen decides to use.
