There ought to be a way they can make some of these underused areas more
appealing.
My picks for most worthless zones:
Trakanon's Teeth:  Spectral Keepers dark blue to my partner and I.  Very tough,
and very slow regeneration.  Iksar treasure hunters, light blue or green.  No
loot, no one else in zone but people camping for keys or something.  One guy
came in, yelled /ooc "camp check" over and over.  I finally realized we were
the only other people in the zone at the time.  Told him /ooc "we aren't
camping anything".  He responded /ooc "what?  why are you here then?"  I had to
laugh.  Told him we were exploring.  Didn't take us long to figure out why we
were alone there.
Emerald Jungle:  All mobs very dark blue, hard, hard and very aggressive.  Crap
loot.  Got separated from my partner more than once - it's a jungle in there!
I'd hate to lose my corpse in that zone.  What a nightmare.
