Well, it depends.

For "normal" posters, you're absolutely right.

However, there is a species of poster that uses the anonymity of
the net as a license to be enormous assholes.  They're the
computer version of the now quaintly obsolete obscene phone
caller.  And as a further parallel, note that the frequent 
scourge of obscene phone calls (it used to be a real problem
way back when) first dropped off a lot with the advent of
computerized phone switching equipment, which allowed the
phone company to trace the most serious abusers, and then
almost disappeared entirely when caller ID became widespread.

Similarly, a lot of the worst jerks (and I'm talking about
the intentional disrupters, not just the run-of-the-mill
idiots) on the internet would be a hell of a lot more
circumspect if they were posting under their actual names
(or if their actual names were discovered and mentioned).

So the "fascination" with some posters' actual names
isn't based on the want to do anything with that name
(like send them a Christmas card), it's based on the
understanding that once some net-assholes know that you
know who they are, they often start acting like human
beings again.
