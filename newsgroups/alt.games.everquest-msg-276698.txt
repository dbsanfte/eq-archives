Why not just run multiple instances of EQ, in windowed mode, on a single system?  Sure, it
requires some horsepower, but nowhere near as high-end as you might expect.

Some of the benefits are: no KVM and **potential** loss of video quality from
less-expensive cables; no loss of underdesk space; normal electrical consumption;
environmental noise from only a single PC; one set of speakers; no need to maintain the OS
and applications on 3 different PCs.  There are more benefits to be found...just let your
imagination run wild.

I built my latest system, and IMO it works famously for boxing.  The important stuff under
the hood is an Abit IC7-G, a 3.0GHz Northwood, 1GB of PC4000 RAM, and a BFG nVidia GeForce
6800 GT OC.  I value a near-silent system, so it's in a full-tower case, cooled by a PC
Power & Cooling 400W Silencer power supply, a Zalman CNPS7700-Cu, Zalman ZM-NB47J and an
Arctic Cooling NV Silencer 5 in place of the horribly noisy stock vidcard cooler.  I used
Arctic Silver 5 on the CPU and the vidcard, and Arctic Silver Thermal Epoxy on the NB
chip. Net-net is that it can run an extended blast of SETI@HOME on both processor
instances (which heats things up real good according to FanSpeed) and the system remains
truly barely audible from my chair.

When boxing, I run a 60 PAL, a 65 CLR and a 57 ENC.  The PAL is my main, so he's currently
receiving a decent helping of out-group powerleveling in my quest for the Holy Pony.  I'm
finding the ZI of Umbral Plains to be perfect for this.  Last night I was able to be 1/2
of a 6-person Rumblecrush pickup raid - meleeing, healing and slowing all on 1 box!

I run everything from the same EverQuest install folder, using the same executable and
everything.  Once I got my head around the fact that keymappings were going to be the same
for all three instances, it was very easy to optimize the character's gameplay.

Lag is not an issue except in PoK and 25+ person raids.  I'm running the EQ windows in
800x600x32, with all the graphical goodies except shadows.  I keep the Spell Effects set
to Myself and NPC, otherwise the windows get too visually cluttered.

I only have 1 issue to work out, and it's related to zoning more than 1 character at a
time.  If I zone more than 1 character at a time the system will thrash for a minute or
more...and while zoning, the system lags bad enough that switching between windows is
laggy and occasionally flat-out unreliable.  Once the zoning character pops into his new
zone, everything returns to normal.  Right now I work around this with some careful
planning, but I'd love to not have to be quite so careful.

Best regards,
