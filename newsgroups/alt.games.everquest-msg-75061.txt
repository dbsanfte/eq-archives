So, your thought is that there should be something akin to a tackling dummy,
except you can just turn on your attack, walk away for 20 mins or so, and
your skill would have improved?  Isn't that what your training points
represent?  And, as a warrior, what do you use your training points for
other than bringing up combat skills that may have lagged?

Find a friendly mage and go fight their pet in an arena or /d them to fight.
That's how I raised my warriors 1hb and 2hb to max after letting them
languish for 20 levels.  Took about 3 hours to max both skills and no pets
were lost and no deaths.
