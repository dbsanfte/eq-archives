I have not seen any posts about this so...

Last night I wanted to try the new MPC mode on the Test server so I fired up
testeverquest.exe.  It did about 15 minutes of patching then asked me to
restart Everquest.  They have re-done the patcher dialog box on Test.  It
now has a cool Luclin skin and est. download time with est. completion time.
It also has a blue bar for individual file downloads and a gold bar for
total download (similar to your exp bar in game).

The new MPC mode is kinda cool for a while.  You seem to end up in a random
zone as a fairly low lvl critter.  About 95% of the time you will be a
warrior class.  I went through about a couple dozen or more critters last
nite.  The only magic classes I assumed were shaman and enchanter.  I was a
monk twice.  I ended up a lot of the time in Kerra Ridge and Runnyeye.  I
was in a couple Kunark zones and the rest of the time in the old world.
Never in a Velious zone.

My highest lvl was 14, the lowest was lvl 1.  I found Talisman of the Beast
in my shaman spellbook and Enchant Clay in my enchanter spellbook.  As a
giant rattlesnake and an asp I could not Poison and as a ghoul I could not
Root.

As an MPC, I did not get the NPC bonus.  I was regularly killed by blue and
even /con NPC's.  In other words, I fought more like a PC than a NPC.

Aggro seems a bit screwed up.  I was a rabbit in Stonebrunt and an elder
panda slaughtered me for no reason and /con'ed scowling at me.

Enough of my rambling...check it out for yourself.
