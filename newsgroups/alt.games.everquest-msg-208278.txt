            Hello I was wondering if someone can help my brewing ability.



            Right now my brewing is at 204 and it does not seems to be
moving very fast, I have being making Minotaur Hero's Brew which are
supposed to become trivial at 248. Last night I made over a 100 of them and
I did not get a single point increase.



            Is there a better item I should be making to max out my ability?
