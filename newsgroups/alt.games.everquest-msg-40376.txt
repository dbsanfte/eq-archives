When I was playing my chanter I didn't find the stuns to be big taunts.
The nukes OTOH were big taunts, especially when you consider their poor
damage.

The pets are good offensively, but they tank a lot worse than mage or
necro pets.

The pet pretty much sucks for soloing in my experience: it's just too
fragile (although it can work well with a duo). Charming can work, but
you *really* want to have jboots or sow.

3 is too low. Necros can actually heal pretty darn well. The only thing
they can't do is heal fast.

I think this is too high. It's true that monks draw agro, but they
don't have the taunt skill so it can be difficult for them to get a mob
off a robe or cleric.

> Healing: 1, bandages

Too low. Monks have higher caps on bind wounds (I think) and mend is
really nice.

Too low. I can still solo rather easily at 41 with mediocre gear (the
only good piece of gear I have is a tink bag). At 39 I could bandage up
to 60% and take on blue mobs and rarely have to burn mend so the only
down time was bandaging. I'm having a bit more trouble at 41, but I
still don't have a lot of down time.

Ya, it lets them cross safely, but only at the cost of slowing them to
a crawl which is a pretty serious drawback especially in outdoor zones.
Feign death OTOH works wonders as long as the mobs aren't way higher
than you.

> BARD:
> Hostile Territory Travel: 5, invis, ivu, sneak

Maybe higher. The invis song is much better than the spell because it
will only drop if the bard stops singing. Do bards actually get ivu?

> Corpse Recovery: 4

The invis song works great in a lot of zones for CR and bards also get
a corpse locate song.

> When-The-Shit-Hits-The-Fan: 4

They have 2 options that I know of: in an outdoor zone they can fire up
selos and leave the mobs in the dust or they can sing the ae fear song
to buy time for people to run for the zone or to get evac off.

> Pulling: 4

Too low. Bards have plate so they can tank a bit, they have a reliable
invis so they can scout, they have tracking, and they have a lull song
that's almost as good as harmony. Of course once they get the mana song
they often have to give up pulling...

They rock in unbalanced groups, which many pickup groups are of course.
