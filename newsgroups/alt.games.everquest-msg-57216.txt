There is more than the one flat rate plan, also the local loop opening up
is under way..ie there is a time when it is required to be opened which is
very soon, I imgaine nature being what it is the closer we get tot he
deadline the more vociferous the calls to do it right now will be. There
are historical issues in place concerning the fact BTR used to be a
government entity that got privatised and then had to completely rework
its infrastructure....a task that would have been impossible to do in an
open competitive market and hence no investors would have touched it, so
a sell off would have been pointless....
