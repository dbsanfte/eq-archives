I was in Karnor's last night in LCY and tried the "assisting the mezzed 
mob" thing and it wasn't working so well.  Puller would grab a dog and a 
curate and bring them towards the room.  I would target the curate and 
start the mez as he drags them over top of me.  It would mez, then I would 
go to another part of the room.

When I would assist the curate, he would be looking at the puller ( Ranger 
pulling with Snare ).  As soon as mez broke, the bastard would nuke me.

This happened a couple of times.
