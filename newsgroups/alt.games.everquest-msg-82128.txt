You were most likely referring to the Gorge Hounds with the cash comment, 
and not the Evil Eyes.  When you get higher in levels, you will be able to 
farm the Evil Eyes for cash in The Gorge of King Xrobb, which is connected 
to EK.

There is a double spawn of Evil Eyes in there, and one wanderer.  The 2-
spawn is on a 6-minute timer, which is real nice.

About 50% of the time, instead of an Evil Eye, you will get Lord Syrkl or 
Lord Svir - they are a little harder.

And 2 ( ? ) times an Earth day, you will get a bigger Evil Eye pop on the 
Throne in the middle.  He's over level 30 ( as opposed to the others, which 
start in the low 20s, I belive ), and will kick your ass if you aren't 
ready for him - assuming you are just barely keeping the other 2 Eyes 
rotated.

If you are really lucky, you will get a glimpse of King Xrobb himself or 
the named Imp/Gargoyle guy.  I've never seen either.

The Evil Eyes in the Gorge are all Enchanters.  The will cast a pet, buff 
up, and then eventually cast Illusion: Human.  Of course, they will charm 
you if you give them the chance.

They drop minor gems that sell for 2-6pp each, some cash, some jewelry, and 
some junk.  In the last few months, they have been dropping some Evil Eye 
Fluid or something - beastlord quest, maybe?  The Gems add up and so does 
some of the Jewelry.  Real nice, too, if you are a Jeweler.

Kill enough shit in The Gorge, and you will become Allied with some of the 
gobbies in Runnyeye.

One last bit of Info.  If you are a D&D Vet, you will remember Beholders.  
These are what Evil Eyes are modeled after.  You may also remember Gas 
Spores, which were fake Beholders that exploded and diseased you ( or 
something like that ).  Verant has also included these in the Gorge.  If 
you ever see an Evil Eye wandering around, and it doesn't have a pet, hit 
it with a ranged weapon or a damaging spell - don't melee it right off.  It 
just may be a fake Evil Eye that will die with very minimum damage.  It may 
even be 1hp *shrug*.
