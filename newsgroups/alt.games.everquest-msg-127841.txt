That reminds me of this new program called MapX. MapX and EQ dont interact
with each other. EQ dumps the information out for anyone to see, the program
scoops it up. EQ also sends keyboard events, which are not as easy to get,
but SneakyAmp gets them and uses them to control Winamp. Even though
SneakyAmp works with anything, there is a DLL attached directly to the EQ
process, peeking at the keyboard events. EQ may not want other programs to
see the keyboard events, but its there anyways. In comparison, MapX is
nothing! Ban SneakyAmp!

In the end, MapX wont give anyone an advantage over players who dont use it.
If you can think of a realistic scenario where knowing your position on a
map instantly will enable you to screw over people who need to take 2
seconds to figure it out, then maybe I'll side with you DT. But that
scenario doesnt exist.

The whole debate is rather silly, but I'm bored. :)
