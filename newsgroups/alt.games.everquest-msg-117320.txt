I agree that it has some "groovy" value - including the possibility
that it could be used in a lot of player-run quests and such.

It should be possible with one additional field (assuming 'normal'
database practices) on the *character* record. If character Field-X
references an item in the Master Item Table, a new character Field-Y
could contain customizations, perhaps as simple as a short string.

Now, whether the additional field (which would, of course, consume
resources) would be worth the cost, I don't know.
