He's a total green newbie. Let's put him through a training period of
a few days before we go medieval on him. At least he was responsive
about shutting down PGP.

Christopher, here are some guidelines to generally accepted practice
in this newsgroup...

Don't post messages with PGP stuff in them.
don't post messages in HTML.
Don't post any binary attachments.
Don't post 'empty' or 'no text' messages.
Don't change the subject in your replies.
Do trim quoted material down to just that needed to maintain the
thread.
Do bottom post - that is, put your replies under the relevant quoted
material.
Do attack Bizbee. I'm not sure why, but it seems to be a rite of
passage for a lot of the recent newcomers. :)
