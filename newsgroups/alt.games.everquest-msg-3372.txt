...you get the sporadic urge to say "rofl" out loud when something is
mildly funny, or "afk" when going to the bathroom

...you relate EQ anecdotes to non players, knowing full well you will
get (at best) a blank stare

...you debate class balancing issues with a passion normally reserved
for major religious disagreements

...you unapologetically use "nerf" as a verb in non-EQ conversation

...you can remember when a BBC was uber.
