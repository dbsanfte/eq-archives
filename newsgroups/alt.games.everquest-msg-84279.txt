Well - in my case it's the "plowed because they've been sitting there
drinking for last three hours".... : )  I normally start a saturday session
at 10am with a fresh carton of beer in the fridge and by 5-6pm I am
stumbling down the bottlo's for the next carton. At 10pm I think about going
out on the town....Geez - I wonder why I don't score often? Sundays start
the same as saturday but without the option of going out so by midnight I am
generally playing pretty plastered.

Funnily enough I don't die very often though I only solo and my highest
character just dinged 30 and I have absolutely no interest in the "high end
game" at all and generally "coast" the characters once they hit high
20's....
