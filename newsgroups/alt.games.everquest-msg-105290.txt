 As a followup, since I happened to notice it...

Post by Locz:

"I did a big parseing study on the effects of non-STR ATK. The study was
posted on the Ranger's Glade and was a very long and popular thread a
few months back. Unfortunately, the Glade's threads were all lost in a
wipe a few weeks ago so I cannot give you a link to this thread.
However, I will summarize results as best I can.

Parse study was done in pre-nerf FG soloing on mushrooms. Dataset size
was many thousands of slashes for each condition. STR was kept constant
at about 225 and ATK was varied from about 1200 to about 1475 using
ranger buffage and a necro buff. Therefore, the study compared the
effect of increasing ATK by 275 against a rather lame blue-con target
(mushrooms).

Basically, increasing ATK changed the shape of the damage histogram, so
that high ATK had many more high damage hits. In fact at the high ATK,
the frequency of the maximum damage cap slash for both the main and
off-hand (91 and 78? respectively) became about as equal as the
frequency of the "magic modal number slash". At low ATK, the histogram
was much more tilted to lower-damage slashes, so that the maximum damage
cap slash was quite uncommon and the "magic modal number slash" was by
far the most common. {Other parse studies of mine (not this study) has
shown that at about ATK > 1525, against standard grind-class MOBs, my
most common slash becomes my maximum damage cap slash, and not the
"magic-number modal slash"}

Increasing ATK did NOT change the hit accuracy. The hit accuracy was
maintained at about 65% at either 1200 or 1475 ATK.

The damage increase on raising ATK (at fixed strength) over this range
versus FG shrooms was found to follow the following relationship:
%damage increase = delta-ATK * 0.106%

In other words, increasing my ATK by 275 (at fixed strength) over a
range of 275 increased my damage by 275 * 0.106% = 29%.

These results were in *excellent* agreement with other parse results
posted subsequently by Sean on the Glade. Primal avatar increase ATK by
133. Parse results also show that primal avatar results in an
approximately 15% increase in damage.

In raids, we try to buff up our rogues, monks and rangers with as many
+ATK buffs as possible. ATK buffing can potentially increase the dps of
our damage-dealing classes by 30% or more. "
