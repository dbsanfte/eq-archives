Was looking for a rare drop for lvl 8 rng newbie armor that drops
somewhere in Crushbone. Rumor says it drops in the slaver area and in
throne room. So after being killed 3 times and chased to zone repeatly
I decided to grab my main and find it. At that point I went to the
throne room, and it was empty. Was like that for 10 mins or more. So I
got the mobs into a managable spawn but no drop. About half an hour
more I was fighting one mob when 'Divenity' and 'Saedaria' come in and
without as much as a 'hello' start killing stuff. I told them the TR
is camped. Nothing. 'Saedaria' keeps right on killing. Finally a
message from 'Divenity' saying sorry they didn't know anyone was in
here. Evidently I, and my pet, can fight invisible and that fact that
mobs were dying by themselves didn't phase these two. Yeah right. So
after its acknowledge that I had the camp first you think they would
leave right? Nope. 'Divenity' takes up a spot on the table and
'Saedaria' goes right on killing. To top it off they actually have the
gall to /ooc for more people to join them. After several attempts at
explaining to them what 'camp etiquette' was and what they are doing
is 'camp jumping' I get told I shouldn't be there because I am too
high a level. By this time 2 other join and its clear this isn't going
to be resolved unless I make it clear to them this is wrong. So I
loaded up my mid range damage spell and waited til they went after a
high mob and I did more than 50% dmg but didn't kill it. Needless to
say they had to kill the mob but not get any experience. I got their
attention with that and they soon apologised and asked me to leave. I
refused once again explaining I was there first and they jumped my
camp. Then things got nasty and they did more /ooc invites. So I
/shout the situation briefly and explained that no xp would be got by
anyone joining. They had 2 more join, then 3 quit, and one stuck it
out. This went on for about 5-10 mins more. Then they just attacked a
mob and sat back waiting for me to kill it. Nope. Soon they were
swarmed and running for the zone.

Now while I don't recommend the action taken by me, these two were
extreme cases and imo didn't get fully what they deserved. I could
have been a lvl that was getting XP there and they most likely would
have done the same thing. A warning to people like this. It can and
will come back to bite you in the future.
