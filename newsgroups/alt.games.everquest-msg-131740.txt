    Pretty much. I usually prefer 3 enchanters, 1 cleric, two wizards (one
of which pulls), but I'm a cleric and I think of any deaths as failures on
my part. Even if I am surrounded by 70 mobs and healing people wearing
tissue paper for armour.

    Replace "mez" with "stun" and you've got it. The AoE stuns are pretty
low mana, BTW, so that ENC spam can last a long time if you need it to.

    I don't group heal much. It's mostly single-target stuff, like CE on
enchanters before the mobs arrive, or a spell to top up the puller before he
goes for more.

    The cleric is also a damage source. The Unspoken Word is very fast
casting and efficient, and Upheaval isn't that bad a PBAoE (although it
pales to Jyll's X). I usually can heal a few folks, and drop two Upheavals
and an Unspoken Word per pull, and match mana expenditure with the others in
the group. That's all the healing covered and 2 K damage per mob - not a bad
contribution!

    You'll have to play around and see if the extra mana expenditure for
inefficient Upheaval matches the mana regen from the bard - I strongly
suspect it doesn't. The bard is nice to have around in case there's
stragglers at the end, though. We usually have up ENC pets for the same
reason, or if the mobs don't dispel have dire charmed pets.

    Don't be afraid to let a wizard pull. The insta-cast on a TFlux staff
means they can tag on the run, and the rune effect on the wizard epic means
they're tougher than they look (and cost you less mana to heal). In tough
places, like Acrylia pre-nerf, we had a warrior with the Rampage AA ability
and Earthshaker (procs Earthquake) go pull - he could take all the harm
touches and nukes, and provided a way of dispatching stragglers without
using mana and creating more downtime.

    PBAoE's. When you have wizards, you're using the Jyll's line of PBAoE's.
Clerics and druids can chip in Upheaval, and mages cast Scintillation. What
kills folks is resists - if a small group of mobs get multiple resists, you
have a big problem to deal with.

    Try comparing what your druid friend can do in damage chain-casting
Upheaval until OOM with what a wizard can do chain-casting Jyll's. There's a
fair efficiency gap there IIRC.

    Fungus Grove. I would be surprised if your server didn't have a Fungus
Grove AoE group working 24/7. Standing right at the safe spot beside the
pond, pulling every mushroom patch, bandit camp, and dreg they can get their
hands on (and the odd underbulk when they get bored). Mistmoore would be a
nice place to practice for Sebilis, since you'd get a lot of casters in a
Mistmoore pull (and you'd get a ton of mobs with ease).
