hehe ouch.  That had to have been a close call on a mob hitting for 1k+

AoW was exactly who I was thinking about (never fought the emp)

Well I think SoL as a whole has been doing that, I can think of many Luclin
fights where necros are godly.. can you even name 1 velious mob where the
same holds true?

Casters overall got a nice boost with SoL (and those outrageously high mobs
AC's, where only nukes are rly worthwhile).  Paladins got a really nice
boost too, in places like Akheva, Ssra, even exp places like the grey
