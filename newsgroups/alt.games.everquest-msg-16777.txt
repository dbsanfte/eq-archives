Nope, neither animals or undead can be pickpocketed.  Over level 50,
only pickable folks -5 levels to can be picked, also (so no picking 1000 pp
from Naggy).

Now that's true...if it's in the loot table and on his/her person,
you can pick anything that's non "tagged" (magic, no drop, etc).
Not wanting to mess my Indigo warrior faction up more (I'd just
gotten it back up after newbie days in CB), I'd looted D'Vinn's
heart but didn't want to kill the Oggok ambassador.  I just snuck
behind him and picked his heart...and then killed him for his Dragoon
Dirk...
