I had my EQ on the D drive also.  When SOL was not working properly I
moved it to C.  After tons of changes (still not working) I did notice
that EQ was being installed all over the place.  Checked reg and
notice EQ pointing to c also.

Just letting you know you are not the only one have simialar problems.
No answer for you sorry.
