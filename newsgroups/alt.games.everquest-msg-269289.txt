I don't think I'm going to bother with tradeskills after my experience in 
EQ1 but I was thinking of trying to raise Harvesting (at least in some 
areas). The idea of picking up valuable things just by running around has a 
certain appeal.

Which are the easiest areas to raise?
Which are the fastest (in case these are not the same)?

For example, from what I've read here Trapping is a real pain but I'm not 
sure if that is due to time or rarity.

How many hours should I expect to spend running around in order to reach 
some kind of benchmark levels; tier 1, 2, 3, etc.?

I'd like to be able to harvest things for my artisan friends from time to 
time. But based on my experience in EQ1, and what I've read here, if you 
don't *like* tradeskills you're probably better off just hunting mobs and 
handing your friends some cash!  :-)
