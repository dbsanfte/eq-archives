From what I understand, the Charter doesn't mean much to your Canadian
Guv'ment..

I seem to recall recently where they forbade all foreign TV signals
from being received, in violation of that same Charter..

If I recall correctly, the only other country that does that is
Cuba...

Sounds like a waffle in progress..  Earlier you were saying that
Alberta CAN'T stop it.  Now you are saying Alberta CAN stop it, but
only at the expense of other rights..

Another prime example of your debating style.

Ahhhhhh Interesting....  So they are "seriously considering" it or
else they would not be "commenting on it"... Does that sum up your
position??

So, I guess PBS is "seriously considering" adding an HIV Muppet to the
US Seasame Show, because they have "commented on it."  Right???

I guess that shoots down your's and Lesa's contention that there is no
plan to bring the HIV MUppet to the US....

Unless, of course, you feel that "seriously considering" it !=
planning it.

It's still only 4%.....

Why don't we make it a law to give Blondes extra rights??  Why not
make it a law to give people with glasses or braces extra rights??
