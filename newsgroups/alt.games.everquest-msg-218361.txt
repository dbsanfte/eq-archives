When you get a little higher in level you're going to discover there are
zones where auto follow doesnt work at any range and you either know the
way, you stay very alert and change course as they do, or you get left
behind.

example: kael for the most part is an auto followable zone. gunthak is not.
dulak it auto followable, nadox.. at least near lava entrance.. is not.
