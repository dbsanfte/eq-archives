Teamspeak is awesome. I am playing planetside atm and my Outfit uses
teamspeak with a fairly good pick up ratio since they stipulate you need
teamspeak to be squadleader. I use 5.1 surround sound speakers with a voice
activated headset mike and it works like a charm. No feedback or background
noise get's transmitted at all once you set the levels up properly.
