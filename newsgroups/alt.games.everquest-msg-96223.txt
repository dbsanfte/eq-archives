Frankly, when Tiru started to work on the shawls, and I realized that I did
not have anything greater than a marginal skill at tailoring (31 where
leather padding trivials), nor did Tiru as a cleric have a reliable way of
soloing needed supplies, I decided to start an alt whose sole existence is
to level up on tailoring. There is a guide on eqtraders for how to raise a
character this way. But it does involve having someone who can solo, like a
druid or a necro (I chose DE necro). Camp where you get supplies. EC/WC to
15 (various pelts and silks), Guk spiders to 20, NK to 27ish (crag spiders),
Stonebrunt to 35ish (various pelts) ... etc.

Tarre Solskin is 24, and competing with every other tailor in the game for
the crag spiders. Yesterday I died twice, losing about a yellow. I got two
stacks of silk while I made up for the XP loss, so I didn't really care
about dying much. Gives me a fresh attitude. My necro lives to work on the
shawls. And I am enjoying the challenge. Baking 42, Smithing 27, Fishing 60,
Tailoring 39, Begging 40, Swimming 85.... more to come, obviously. Hard to
work on studded when I'm not deliberately hunting cats- but happy to when
they jump the pet. Meanwhile, I know I'll need silk, so I keep collecting
while it gives me XP. And I've got frosting and a spit so those legs don't
go to waste.
