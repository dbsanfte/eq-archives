You'll recall of course that it wasn't *I* who castigated you, though.

And you'll also recall that the context was EQ1, where the mobs that are 
ignoring the tank and jumping on the healer will probably 2-3 round him.

In EQ2 where the mechanics allow for clusters of weaker mobs, we can get 
away with multiple mob pulls with this sort of 'better AI', and not have 
to contend with the problem that the cleric will invevitably be dead 3 
seconds later.
