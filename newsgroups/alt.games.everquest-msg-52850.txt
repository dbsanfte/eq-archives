Grandmaster is indeed over 200, but Master is merely over 100.

To my knowledge none of the skill attempts for any step of the shawls
trivial at levels over 200, you should be able to grandmaster in
any skill you like and not hurt yourself too badly.  Of course
just because a skill attempt is trivial doesn't mean you will not see
any better odds with a higher skill... but niether does even a 250
skill guarantee success with any attempt at all, even one that trivials
at skill level 10.

By the way, I see where they have now confirmed the shawls will
go all the way to 10, given the difficulty of 7, I shudder to think
what outlandish requirements 8 thru 10 will have.
