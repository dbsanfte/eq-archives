Cinderella didn't have much of a 'fantasy land' while she was growing 
up.

The 'Cinderella' expression refers to the cinderella story... that is: 
someone who grew up while neglected/abused/impoverished, and *then* 
finally came into their own.

Hell, its even in the dictionary like *that*.

While I don't have any issues with reffing the cinderella at the ball... 
it immediately follows your accusations about how he grew up in an ivory 
tower. The natural context then is how cinderella grew up, which is 
clearly not what you meant, and actually runs counter to what you meant. 
... Which is why its such a ridiculous use of a metaphor.

Yep. She had a typical fairyland princess life, until she surpassed the 
beauty of her stepmother. Granted she was as young as 7 when it happened 
in some versions, but most retellings these days place her much older. 

Plus the name literally means white as snow... and ties into the ivory 
tower jibe that precedes it. 

Its an apt choice.

Cinderella otoh in addition to being abused and neglected was so named 
because she slept on the hearth in the cinders, and was perpetually 
sooty and dusty.

Yeah, Cinderella is an expression so common it appears in the dictionary 
*uncapitalized* as a word to describe someone who grew up in terrible 
conditions, but overcame them.

It was clear what you meant. What you said and what you meant were 
diametrically different. There was nothing that needed explaining.

Barking up the wrong tree there.
