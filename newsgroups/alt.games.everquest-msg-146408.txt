It is indeed a small detail... because a monk tends to take less damage.
This means that unless you are relying on CHeal as your sole
heal, a monk is actually a better MA in many cases than a comperable
warrior with half again as many hp.   Particularly for a non cleric, or
in circumstances where smaller heals are being used a lot, the monk
gets a larger percentage of his bar refreshed with that same mana
expenditure.

On the other hand, where you are facing non melee damage, the
warrior's higher HP total becomes a very significant advantage,
assuming similar resists... and I think a warrior tends to have
much better resists, now that that seems to matter.
