  Actually, the early Celerons were based on the Pentium II.  Later Celerons
were based on the Pentium III architecture, but it's still a budget
processor (it has less, but faster cache than a Pentium II).  Besides,
there's not a lot of difference between early Pentium II's and Pentium
III's... just SSE, I think.  For EQ, a Celeron 333 is probably slower than a
Pentium II 400.
