Apart from the hacking issue, being able to minimise the game would be
very bad. If you are playing the game, you should be playing it, not
reading email. Allowing it would only encourage solo rare-loot farming,
slow spawn camping, and other things that drag down the average fun
level of people playing the game.

What they should do is to create a separate chat-only client, whereby
people could talk in /tells and /guild, while not actually being 'in the
world' in any sense. This would be great for those time you just want to
hang out and chat, or pop by to see if anything is going on, while still
talking over ICQ, reading web boards, or whatever.

This would be a normal Windows application, iconisable, resizable etc.
You can also have versions that worked from a web page (so you can talk
to people in EQ from a public computer), and maybe even a WAP version
that worked from a mobile phone.
