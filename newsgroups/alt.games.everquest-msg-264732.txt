Zoned into Antonica2. Sigh...

It probably is temporary. Seems like a cheap solution and I am disappointed, 
I'll have to see what kind of effect it winds up having. Antonica is a major 
hub that is traversed between most of the other zones I've been hunting.

I'm hunting centaurs and giants (! they are great models btw) in the Steppes 
now, a zone which feels every bit as big as the one of the Karanas, even has 
griffons and griffawns flying around. In all likelihood zones like this will 
not need instancing. Guess they had to do something about Antonica, though.
