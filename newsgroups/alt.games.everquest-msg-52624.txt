I am at least 7 levels away from getting even a remote chance at
becoming able to go to either of those places. I could quite possibly
have my epic by then (my current goal is elaborate scimitar).
Heck, I had to look up the gloves of earthcrafting quest last night, I
had looked at it once before and not bothered concerning myself, since
it required the head of Derakor and I didn't exactly expect to be able
to get *that* for quite a while. As it happened, I got the chance to
mooch faction at an uberguild's Derakor raid last night, and they
didn't need the thing, so now I have to ding 55 and hunt priests 
- and hopefully those mittens won't be considered trash by Your
Highnessness :p

(Derakor is really a pinhead. His noggin only weighs 1.0, and it fits
in a medium container.)
