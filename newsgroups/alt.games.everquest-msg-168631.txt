Um. Well, I like to think I'm high level, and I'm in a Vex Thal
raiding guild.

I can tell you right now that 99%, if not 100%, of our raiders still
take shaman sta and focus every raid. Many of the meleeists with
primals take primal essence or feral avatar.

Spirit of Bah'Li is a nice little ATK addition for indoor zones we're
moving through quickly when theres a buff spot free.

Without Shaman slows many encounters would be far far harder. Without
their resist buffs things like the cursed fight would suck more
than they already do. Have you actually played the high end game?

They quite simply do the most damage of any melee class, have instant
lose aggro AA's, get evade to reduce aggro, and gain the ease of
travel of SOS.

Combine that with decent AC, HP and defense, and they're looking
pretty good to me, thanks.

As a part time druid, from a casual players point of view druids
ARE overpowered.

My druid is like EQ on easy mode. In raids they're useful and
desirable, but not generally stellar, its true. They're a pretty
solid class raiding though, especially once the AA start to rack
up.
