Probably won't screw up gameplay.  Probably will screw up lots of people's
performance and display and so on.  And the models really seem to suck so
far, but yeah, no gameplay problems here.

Flop?  Who said anything about popularity?  They will undoubtably be a
number of screwed up quests that won't be fixed for years, though, if ever.

 Adding horses? Yeah all that horse manure is

Might well unbalance the game, changing movement rates and so on.

Golly, how could I ever think changing stats and skill levels in a game
based entirely on stats and skill levels could lead in unforseen problems?
It's only the core of the game after all, what could happen?

See above.
