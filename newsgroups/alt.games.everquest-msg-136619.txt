Didn't you know there is a special key on the keyboard made just for exiting
EQ? It looks like a little MS Window logo. I am running win2000 and whenever
I want to exit to the desktop if I am in a safe place I just push the button
and viola. Or I camp to character selection screen first and then press it.
Beats waiting for /camp desktop and wondering if it will work. Whenever I
used that EQ would hang for 45 seconds before exiting; this way is instant.
