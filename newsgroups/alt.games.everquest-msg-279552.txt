I know that you saw my post as another chance to display your big brain
to everyone, but the fact is that it came off wrong.  The original
poster was complaining about the monk class, specifically how monks
don't do anything better than anyone else.  I pointed out that there
are *some* things that monks do better than anyone else, and that some
of the advantages other classes may have are transitory.  You replied
to me explaining why I was "wrong" and whoing why monks are almost
always outshined by another class.

For example, everyone knows that Necros' and SKs' ability to snare can
give them an advantage when pulling in some cases.  Snaring a mob so
that it doesn't return to its spawn point is something I was doing with
my necro long ago.  There were only two reasons for you to bother
mentioning this one advantage that SKs and Necros have over monks.  1)
You want to convince the original poster that monks are indeed a
horrible class, outshined by many others.  2) You want to prove how
smart you are to everyone reading.
