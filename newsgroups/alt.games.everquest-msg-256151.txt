Long ago and far away, these guys calling themselves 'Verant' wanted to 
make a game. Sony liked the idea but was afraid of getting egg on their 
pretty Sony name, so they published it as 989 Studios (their 
sports-and-a-few-things-else-at-the-time label)
Then they rolled the publishing out under the Sony label.
Then they bought a big share of Verant
Then they bought out Verant
Then they disolved Verant, and moved everything to 'Sony Online 
Entertainment'
There was much rejoicing (plays canned bored sounding cheering from one 
of his Might and Magic games)
Or not.
But we all know who you mean.

Have fun. Stay awhile, stay forever...
