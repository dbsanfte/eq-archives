I buy both sapphires and star rubies in Erudin.  Why?
Because that is the closest jeweler to a lowbie druid's
port; Tox, Erudin, Erudin's Palace, NK, SK run to the
barn, get 3 blue.

Unfortunately, on Morel Thule, I've been unable to unload
crafted guantlets for anywhere -near- the cost of two star
rubies, I think in four tries I've managed to get back about 150pp
on my 500pp investment.

I fondly remember an earlier character doubling his money
each time on this... but that was without the luxury of porting
to buy the gems and porting to EC or GFay to sell.  Guess
I should have run a druid as my first character, rather than
as my twelth!
