What makes it irrational? 

Simply because you do not think it rational?

You seem to be assuming that the only reason

in all sorts of situations.

I raised a hypothetical; what if EQ were
responsible?

You might like to think that the situation could
never arise, but the question may soon be asked in

a court?
