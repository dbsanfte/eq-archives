   I went to the Oasis of Marr yesterday to turn in a pack of
Greater Lightstones to Synthan at the gypsy camp.  I had done 
this several times before with no problem.  This time, however,
she was absent.  A few of the other gypsies were still there.
I sent a petition, and was contacted by a GM.  He said he would
go look for her, and get back to me when he found her.  He never
contacted me again.  Today I checked, and Synthan is still gone.
I went to the official EQ website at Sony, and sent them an email
asking about this.
   Is Sythan gone from all servers?  How about the other gypsies
that take the GLS (I know of one in the Karanas, but I don't 
know her name).  Is Verant perhaps trying to keep more GLS in
circulation for use in making Wu's armor?  Prevent over-hunting
of wisps?  (note to the humor-impaired, vocal minority of this
newsgroup, this was a joke.)
    Any information on this matter would be very welcome.
