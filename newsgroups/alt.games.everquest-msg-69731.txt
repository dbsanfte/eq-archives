After sometime trying to get a stack of Viscous Mana for my Iksar Monk (and
failing) it struck me how ridiculous the situation with Viscous Mana is. Now, as
far as known, the only thing Viscous Mana is used for is making cured silk.
Until recently the only class that used cured silk was the monk, now beastlords
can use it (bastards!). The only source of Viscous Mana is from an enchanter
who, in general, have absolutely no use for the spell whatsoever. Further more,
as far as I can tell, it takes up a fair bit of mana to make a stack of the
stuff thus most enchanters are reluctant to make Viscous Mana for under 50pp
even if you supply the Pearls (roughly 5pp each) and the Poison Vials (roughly
3pp each).
The whole thing doesn't make sense! Why give one class a spell who's only known
purpose is to make armour for another class???
