As you've been told, by numerous people, it's intentional. Why bother giving
the skill/Spell of Feign Death if you could just LD and survive, hell, you
don't even need to use any timing or worry about failure.
The game is meant to challenge, unlike yourself, who appears to be mentally
challenged, actually I don't think that at all, I take it back, I agree with
TH on this one.

While you're about it can you thousands of /bug petitioners also mention
that I can't solo Sgt Slate who is 5 levels lower than me and that I don't
have 100k in plat in the bank where I am sure I deserve it.
I'll not be reporting this bug, I have too many paint chips that need
eating.
No, they won't fix an intentional feature, they'll likely just have an even
lower opinion of their customers than they due already.

CF
Actually, I can't even solo Battlewizard Unak who is some 17 lvls lower than
me, no idea why that is, used to do him at 45th with 3 bubs of health, now
at 47th I can't take him with full health...strange.
