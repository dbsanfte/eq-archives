Read the actual site ;)

Full analysis + confidence ratings for all figures are provided.

Cut'n'paste for your pleasure, though:

EverQuest  (Confidence Rating: A)

EQs figures pretty much speak for themselves.  At one point their
growth seemed nearly unstoppable, but the trend began to slow, and
after peaking at about 460,000 subscribers, it now appears EQ is
shrinking.  Indeed, the latest press releases from SOE are quoting
only over 430,000 and in their announcement of EQs 5th anniversary
the claim only over 420,000.  The latest two data points on the
graph come not from press releases, but from inside sources, and
they show a somewhat different picture than what was indicated
before  EQ reached some 550,000 subscribers in September 2004, and
as of March 2005 stands at 460,000.  It is important to note that
these latter two data point represent not just total monthly
subscribers, but also subscribers with active accounts on free time,
game time cards, etc.  It is possible that the earlier figures from
the SOE press releases were deliberately conservative, or did not
count such accounts, thus accounting for the discrepancy.
