One day in the Garden of Eden, God was handing out leftover gifts of
creation. He told Adam and Eve, "I only have two left, so whoever
speaks up first gets it. Who wants to be able to pee standing up?"
Adam started jumping up and down, shouting, "Me! Me! That'd just be
the coolest thing ever! I wanna pee standing up!"
God smiled and said, "It is done. Eve, I guess you'll have to settle
with the multiple orgasms..."
