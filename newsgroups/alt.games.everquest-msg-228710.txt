Well, it seems to me that it's entirely possible they didn't even
throw this information at him until after it was discovered by
players, and even then, the information was only limited. Everyone I
know of that had interaction with Bren before his promotion think he's
a great guy. I'm inclined to chalk the tone of the announcement up to
two things: Lack of communication for him to pass on and still
adjusting to the requirements of his new role. :p

I know GMs and guides are often left in the dark. Seems to me it's a
factor of the devs and such feeling that the CS and apparently the PR
people don't need to know about upcoming changes until they're ready
to talk. ><
