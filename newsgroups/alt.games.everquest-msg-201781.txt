So, with HoH, CoD, BoT and Torment (1 or 2 others?) opening
to my 63 (gonna be 64 today dangit!) self next wednesday, 
where are good spots to look for groups to get specs?  Is
it xp camps in these zones that drop them (like they do
ep's in PoV)?

As soon as I get Black Steel, Planar Renewal and Sun Vortex
(rune spell) the other ones can just come as they may - But
I've been without a new magic nuke since shock of steel(!)
and SoFB is a bit weak in the Planes too.  Sun Storm is great
when all waves hit, even for a conj specced mage and figuring
that the bracer doesn't help and that rains (mage rains at 
least) have a built in secondary resist of 20% (IIRC, can't 
seem to find the tests that were run at the Tower).

Figuring all this in, Sun Storm (Mana 440, 3 waves of 800) gets the
following theoretical efficiency for a conjuration specced
mage (going with a 2% reduction in mana for 50 spec in evoc)

5.57 without the resists
4.45 with

SoFB is 334 for 1005 damage (base 3.01 ratio) but - conjuration
spec of 200 reduces mana cost to 300, bracer boosts damage to
(average) 1105, so our new theoretical efficiency is - 3.68

But Black Steel, 360 for 1400 dam (base 3.89) becomes 4.75
adjusted ratio (10 percent for 200 spec, avg 10percent boost
from bracer))

All this doesn't count in the earring (avg 7.5% mana savings,
but applies to both types)

So, you can see why mages are a little tired of that secondary
resist.  Rains are hard enough to use effectively already (you
can hit yourself, and I still do occasionally.  No use when a
mezzed mob is close.  No use when a second mob is in camp who
isn't actively being tanked) that the secondary resist is just
plain ludicrous, since it makes them less efficient than their
equivalent leveled single target nuke.
