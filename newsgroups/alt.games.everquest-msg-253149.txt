Test has a low enough server population that if you destroy your 
reputation you'll never group again. For a rogue, in particular, who is 
probably the worst soloer in the game... he's pretty much done, unless 
he rerolls at level 1 with a new name *and* keeps his mouth shut.

Further, characters on test can't move to other servers, afaik, except 
maybe to legends, so he's not going to escape his fate that way either.
