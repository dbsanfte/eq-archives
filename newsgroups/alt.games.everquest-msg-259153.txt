The chart does not mention procs. Any weapon with a proc will be used
by your pet. So the mage summoned ones with the DD on them will add to
his combat abilities. I like giving my pet a couple of gnoll hide
lariots. They proc a stun, it's nice to see my pet chain stun caster
mobs. (Of course I'm a shamman, so it's not quite the same thing, my
doggie will not dual wield unless I give him two weapons.)
