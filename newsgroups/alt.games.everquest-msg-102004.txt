Got reassigned down here in San Diego.  I would kill him if he went awol just 3
months before he retires with 20 years and blows his pension.  And I would loot
even the no-drop stuff.

    I thought of that.  Unfortunately, I'll be the one doing most of the driving
back.  Lenny hates to drive.  You know how trolls are about that whole "reading
road signs" thing.  And he hates humans, so any pedestrians would be at a large
disadvantage should he spy one.

   Weren't you the one that lost it when you were making metal bits and begged
someone to come kill you, and offered _your_ stuff as payment?  If I give you
_my_ stuff, how do I know passing dRoODz hanging out in front of the bank
/shouting NE1 gv me weapons or armor plz, on CR!

Aw. They will grow on you, just wait.  A few days with seeing any more of my
posts, and you'll sort to get all twitchy.  You'll be asking Biz, Lokari, or
Twohead to start doing them.
