Given your initial reason for buying the game, that's actually a damn
good choice.  As I hinted at with the SWG analogy, you shouldn't be
buying games *just* to be with your friends.

It points out context.
I have different friends in different contexts.  All of them have one
thing in common:  I can do things with them that are enjoyable, and
that they enjoy as well.  
Some of my friends have been part of games that I've also been a part
of, but in ways that don't let us do things together.  Sometimes even
in ways that put us at odds.  In *those* contexts, we are not friends;
sometimes we're even enemies.  In other contexts, however, we are
still friends.

Like I said, I will admit to one conceit:  I have little respect for
folks who'll do boring-ass shit to level faster.  That also puts the
last of my comments about SWG into some relevancy:  I don't want to
touch it because it would (potentially) be bad for the friendship.
I'm actually scared that I'll find it so bloody lame that I'll lose
respect for my friend who *does* enjoy it.
