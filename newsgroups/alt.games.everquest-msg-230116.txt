I was thinking more along the lines of really special magic items
being bound to your soul somehow...  That way if you work really
hard to complete a challenging quest, the reward you get at the end
wouldn't decay.  But the item would be magically bound to you.  Same
as NO DROP I guess, but "soulbound" has more flavor.  :)

It might have the desirable side effect of encouraging people to do
more quests, too...  Because their regular equipment would decay,
and that would be annoying.  But the system would have to be carefully
balanced so that regular equipment was still worth buying and repairing.

In such a system I probably wouldn't let any item ever be repaired back
to 100%......maybe 90%.  So if your sword could strike an enemy 1000
times before breaking, the first repair would only repair it up to 900
hits (90%), and the second repair would only repair it up to 810 hits,
etc.  Which gives it a longer life and makes it reasonably tradeable...
But still limits its life.

Something like that anyway.  :)

Perhaps allow smiths to repair, as well as having some NPC's that can
do it.  And add some magic spells that let you add charges back to
items that hold magical charges.

I am probably in the minority here but I believe EQ has too much
content for some levels...it's depressing to see so many empty zones
these days...

Neat idea.
