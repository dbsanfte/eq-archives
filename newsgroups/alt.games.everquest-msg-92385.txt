Hey, DTV doesn't set the prices. Sony/RCA/Hughs/etc are the ones that
do that. ;-) DTV will give you a free receiver and dish if you agree
to a service contract, though...

Actually, DTV will to. Threaten to disconnect, and they'll waive the
$60 service call charge. Parts and labor are still gonna be charged,
but that's usually not much.

Yeah...but, then again, that's on rental equipment. Of course you're
gonna wanna help take care of your rental equipment. ;-)

Yeah, their 2-way satellite internet service requires a larger dish,
and you can rig it up to run the satellite TV service as well. Also,
in places like Alaska and Hawaii, the larger dish is required to get
strong enough signal at all...

That qualifies as "fewer". ;-) Deal with the access card is the signal
is sent out, scrambled, and can be picked up by anyone with a dish and
receiver. The card is what authorizes the programming to be shown on
the receiver. I guess it's kinda a way to have one of the most vital
parts easily replaceable... The chip loses authorizations from time to
time to glitches or whatnot, requiring the customer to call in and
have a signal sent authorizing the card's ID to get the programming.

Heh. I wonder if cable companies get as many threats from customers
saying they'll go to satellite as we do saying they'll go to cable...
;-p
