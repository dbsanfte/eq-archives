I really like that idea. The only problem is it still leaves young 
chanters out in the cold. Maybe an increase of, say, what Breeze gives 
you now. Breeze, Clarity or KEI could then, of course, be cast upon you 
for even better regen rates with KEI having the level restrictions fixed.

I'm not as fond of that idea. I think a guaranteed wait commitment 
requirement might end up being like having to stare at a spell book. 
Also, I can see casters foregoing dropping a much needed nuke to finish a 
wandering add mob because it would reset their med timer.  :-/
 
Good ideas, though. I do hope SoE reads this group.
