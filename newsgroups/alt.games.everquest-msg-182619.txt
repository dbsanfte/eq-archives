First off, since you're a hybrid your melee timer is not reset when
you cast, so you will on average lose a lot less than the casting
time of the spells from your attacks, the slower the weapon the less
you lose.

Second, if you were doing <over> 40 DPS (from your numbers: 10 seconds
vs. 428 hp) at L48 with a Weighty Polearm and nothing but an FBSS for
haste you were not fighting mobs capable of injuring you, let alone
xp giving mobs.
