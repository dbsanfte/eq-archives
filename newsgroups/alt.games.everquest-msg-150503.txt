> Hail all , has anyone noticed a change in MOK?

I use MoK fairly religiously - I have found that it helps in keeping the
MT's health from falling *too* rapidly and gives me a larger margin of error
for Complete Heal.

Last night I was in HoT and I MoK'd as usual.  Several times I could see the
MT's health go up one percent as a result of MoK.  That is the behavior I've
always expected out of MoK.

As I understand it, MoK was nerfed a long time ago, so that the hit points
healed were tied to the damage the weapon did or something like that.  I'm
honestly not sure of the details.  But I have noticed any nerfing of MoK in
the last couple of months.

On a side note, in the HoT raid, a plate breastplate dropped - first time
ever I'd seen one drop in HoT.  Since it was a pick-up HoT raid, the
breastplate was rolled on - and, to my utter shock, I won.  =)  So now I
have a blueberry chestplate just as soon as I can fix my faction (too many
WW dragon raids, bleh).
