Bard faction is a tough one, since almost nothing you "kill" gives you
faction with them. The key is to realize when you are getting into trouble
with them, and do some quests to raise it up before you crunch it again.
Some of the quests I know that give good bard faction are:

The bard epic (duh!)
The cracked flute one with the gal at the NK spires
The mail runs (think there are a coulpe of these - on in Ak'Anon, and I
think one in FP and Qeynos too)

Can't recall if killing Maligar (as opposed to his doppleganger) helps bard
faction.

Regardless - you're talking some very slow going.
