Ah, you've just touched on one of my biggest pet peeves with EQ, or any
situation where people try to find patterns in randomness.

Given a random event that could happen at any time, it is actually
statistically guaranteed that you will get more "clusters" than evenly spaced
events.  Look at the following *ultra simplified* example:

(WARNING!  Math geekiness ahead!)

Say you flip a coin 5 times, the following are all of the possible
combinations you could get (0 = tails, 1 = heads... I like binary, ok?):

0 0 0 0 0                   1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1                   1 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 1 0                   1 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 1                   1 0 0 1 1
0 0 1 0 0                   1 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 1                   1 0 1 0 1 <-- Non streaky
0 0 1 1 0                   1 0 1 1 0
0 0 1 1 1                   1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 0 0                   1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 1                   1 1 0 0 1
0 1 0 1 0 <-- Non streaky   1 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 1                   1 1 0 1 1
0 1 1 0 0                   1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 1                   1 1 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 0                   1 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 1                   1 1 1 1 1

Note that only *two* (out of 32 possible outcomes) have no streaks.  In other
words, you're just as like to get the same result 5 times in a row as you are
to get perfectly alternating results.

Now, the skill-up random generator is probably something on the order of a 1
in 50 chance (depending on int/wis, etc.) rather than a 50/50 chance, but the
same principle holds true.  You will get streaks.  Randomness has no memory,
which is why if I flip a coin 5 times and get heads 5 times, there is STILL
just a 50/50 chance I'll get tails the 6th time I flip it.

Ok, here's  another example:

Say you have a 1 in 3 chance of succeeding at something, and you try 3 times.
You would *expect* to succeed 1 of those three times.  Well, let's see how it
plays out.  These are ALL of the possible outcomes of trying three times...
let's say a "0" means you succeed:

0 0 0    1 1 1
0 0 1    1 1 2
0 0 2    1 2 0 !
0 1 0    1 2 1
0 1 1 !  1 2 2
0 1 2 !  2 0 0
0 2 0    2 0 1 !
0 2 1 !  2 0 2 !
0 2 2 !  2 1 0 !
1 0 0    2 1 1
1 0 1 !  2 1 2
1 0 2 !  2 2 0 !
1 1 0 !  2 2 1
         2 2 2

The entries marked with ! are where you succeed once out of three times.  Only
12 out of 27 possible outcomes have you succeeding at the "expected" rate.
What does it feel like in the other 15 possible outcomes?  Streakiness.  But
it's a perfectly valid, in fact THE ONLY valid outcome if you have a truly
random generator.  Over time, you will succeed 1/3 of the time, but that 1/3
will arrive mostly in clumps.

So please, none of this "Everquest's random number generator is fux0red"
garbage.  People just try and force patterns where there is randomness, it's a
very natural thing to do.
