    No indeed, which is why I wrote "I read that..." instead of "I'm sure
that..." because  I didn't go and spend 2-3k on wis gear for my enchanter
just to test it.

    I still don't necessarily believe people's assertions that high wis will
do the trick. <shrug> All I can say is that somebody took the time to write
it down somewhere.

Cheers,
James
