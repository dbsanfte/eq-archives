I consider it apt. It is, in fact, rather close to what I've said in
the past, and have been vindicated by later events that seem to show
the easier something is, the less people value it, which then leads to
boredom faster.

That they are is part of the problem. You simply illustrate why they
don't have the staying power they used to, and further reinforce my
point. They have become about shiny baubles and spreadsheet numbers.
But addiction to mmorpgs doesn't come from that. Addiction comes from
the effort it took to get it. There's already been a scientific study
on this, I'll try to dig up the link again later. But basically you
don't value things that come easy.

Assumptions are a dangerous thing. Don't make them unless you are
sure. I am addressing death penalties in all mmorpgs.

And, as mentioned, it is in fact that soaring elation which only comes
under the threat of shattering despair that is the biggest hook of
them all, in the long term, to use your phrasing, though to put it
better: the longer and harder someone needs to work at something the
more addicted they get to it, as long as they maintain the hope of
catching the carrot at some point (if they get discouraged, it all
falls apart and resentment takes over). Has something to do with
dopamine levels or some such thing.
