I guess the only thoughts that come to mind about the Cleric bit is:

"Ewwwww"

What in the world were they doing?

-

btw, I love playing my Nec. Sometimes when I partner up I'll find somebody
who makes allot of (sometimes small) mistakes that would otherwise waste
mana and get people killed. Thankfully, I can just go about my business as I
normally would and treat them sorda like a talking DoT. :)

As for a group class.. well... if you like a Nec, you CAN group - even with
other Necs once you learn the class - but it's not going to be likely that
you'll find one at higher levels. BUT, I find myself not wanting one for the
vast majority of the time. For the most part, groups are for breaking up the
boredom. :)

I could also suggest playing a Mage, since they're a pet class with decent
DD's. Their pets also manage to deal out some good damage. But if you
/really/ want to focus on dealing out direct damage with your caster, then
like the others have said a Wizard is the way to go. Though something tells
me you're going to love your Nec, if you're 16 and like it already. I'd
suggest keeping him around just in case you want to go back to him later.

Good luck,

Who hates having to retype things because accidentally hitting "Undo"
instead of "Spell Check" deletes a whole confounded paragraph...
