Thank you all very much. I know what you mean about the joy of being
poor. In UO that's how I was till I learned how to farm liches. Even
after that it was a grind to save up the money for a house. With the
house life in that game became infinantly easier. Having vendors
became the task at hand then.

I appreciate all the advise and info. I still have LOTS of homework to
do...... and lots to learn.
