ROFL.  This has *got* to be an urban legend.

When I play, I'm a nice guy/gal.  That's because so many people have been 
nice to me - and I'm generally nice in RL.

Now - if this had happened to me, I couldn't have taken the abuse.  I would 
have dragged his corpse's ass deeper into Felwithe.  Maybe later after the 
rez, have him type /duel.  

Good yarn.

M.
