The only time this discussion has anything remotely resembling a point 
is if there is a spill.

It really ought to be self evident even to you that if the starting 
assumption is:

"nothing to do with the environment is attributable for the injury"

that the conclusion is going to be:

"the environment isn't responsible for the injury",

and by extension:

"the host of the environment isn't responsible for the injury."

Nice one DT. I'll gladly concede we completely agree that if we state 
the initial assumptions such that the environment is irrelevant to the 
injury then we can't conclude its liable for one.

Now ... on the flip side... a spill makes the whole case actually 
interesting, even controversial...
