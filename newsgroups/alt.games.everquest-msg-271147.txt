Again, not trying to belittle you, but having not lived through the
phenomenon you have no frame of reference for it.  I did live through it,
and the examples listed about were not once-in-a-lifetime random
occurrences.  That's the way folks played.

Whether or not you choose to believe that fact is, of course, up to you.

Solo?  Not at all.  Understanding the group dynamic is different, and it
changes as you progress.

Way back when, people actually crawled dungeons from an early age.
Levelling wasn't quite as easy, and there was safety in numbers.  People
progressed from Befallen or Upper Guk to places like Cazic Thule
(pre-revamp), learning how their class interacted with other classes in
places where the penalty for screwing up wasn't oppressive.  By the time
they were in their mid 20's they had a firm grasp of the subject.

By means of various methods employed by SOE to trivialize these levels
(unlimited KEI was one, the elimination of any death penaties under 11 was
another, obscene XP for lower levels was yet another), people bypassed that
process.  People weren't learning how their class interacted in the group
setting until their mid-30's or later, when dying hurt more and wipes due to
ignorance weren't as readily forgiven.

Yes.  See above.

There's a difference between common sense and intelligence.  Common sense is
a different thing in someone else's world.  You have to learn their rules
before you can acquire common sense in their environment.

In the real world, if you buy a peice of property you don't have to build
(and destory) four houses on it before you build a hotel on it.  Those are
the rules of the game, though, so Monopoly common sense is different from
real world common sense.  Monopoly common sense must be acquired.  Same with
EQ.

I applaud you for electing to not become dependant on them.  If you had, you
would quite probably be a different player than you are.
