When I choose my MB,  Abit KG7, it lists 1GB modules of PC2100, for $413 US.
A bit pricey for my tastes :-)
I also just checked pricewatch, they don't have any listings for 1GB sticks
of PC2700 or higher, but they do for PC2100, at $339...  still a lot of
cash, and that's for a brand I've never heard of.

I have no idea what the performance difference would be.  Keep in mind that
if you have that much RAM running that fast (PC2700 is quite fast and PC2100
is not too shabby), you'll most likely have bottlenecks in other areas.
Hard drive comes to mind, unless you have one of those snazzy 10k RPM drives
:-)

I suppose that could be just a quirk with the Chipset, or that particular
model of motherboard.  Then again, unless you plan on throwing $1000 or more
at JUST memory, it's probably a moot point.  Personally, I think 1GB (2
sticks of 512) would be plenty for almost any system, and cost a lot less
than a single 1GB chip.
