Supposedly Bertoxx has spread a plague around the Karanas. I believe 
it's for an upcoming event. Some say there are signs of war coming. 
Personally the green hue there is enough to make me sick.

Lake of Ill Omen, South Karana, East Karana, Gorge of King Xorbb, 
Highhold Pass (Keep), etc. Check EQAtlas.com for a level guide.

Personally my wife's 40 druid STILL uses careless lightning. At 30 my 
druid still uses it. It's one of those spells that you will use for many 
levels to come. Later on it will be resisted less than most other 
spells. Right now it may suck up some mana but I think it's worth it. 
Dizzying wind IMNSHO is virtually useless. Unless they've changed the 
resists on it you will have a very hard time making it stick. Even on 
the above druids it was being resisted about 25% of the time. (Yes they 
are maxxed on skills.) The stun is nice if you get it to stick, but I 
pretty much gave up on it.

Your call there. I'm lousy with names.
