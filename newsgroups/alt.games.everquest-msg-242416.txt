Since my account is temporarily activated, I thought I would log in to
grab some screenshots of Fox for art trades on Norrath's Studio.  

Unfortunately Foxeye's armor on her arms and feet is broken (only covers
her shoulders and the tops of her feet).  Plus the zones with the pretty
stuff (like Jaggedpine) are INSANELY laggy.

I've tried deleting texture files, that didn't help.  Full file check from
the patcher. No help.  What is my next step for trying to play nicely with
what I presume is the new graphics engine?

still reject him as God... Foxeye here clearly limits her recognition of 
his status to being the "talking fish guy".  - 42 of alt.games.everquest
