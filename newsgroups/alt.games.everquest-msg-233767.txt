Spiderling Silks:  5 - 8pp each in bazaar.
Spider Silks: 10 - 12pp each in bazaar.
High Quality/Low Quality Bear Pelts:  low's are 10 - 15pp each, highs are
30 - 50pp each.

I've made enough on those to outfit my warrior and twink a level 20 wizard.
I'm not uber-rich off this stuff, but I'd some comfortably middle class off
it.

Oh, and check the vendors often.  I loved the 10 - 15 essence of sunlights I
bought in Oasis of Mar for 7pp and change and sold for 375pp.
