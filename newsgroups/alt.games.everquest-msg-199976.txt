See my problem is this: I'm torn between the two. They are both on complete
opposite ends of the spectrum. One is almost a complete PvE the other is
almost complte PvP. What do I do? I can only have one at a time (money's
short)...I know you are all EQers, so you'll most likely say EQ. I love to
be high leveled, and in SB you can level super fast...unlike EQ were its a
constant struggle.

I know for a fact I will quit both when EQ 2 comes out for sure...
