Well, no. I will say "There is no God" or "There is a God", depending on
which side you want to be contrary on. You are perfectly entitled to argue
against my position w/o providing proof. Most people recognize the existance
of arguments that are a matter of faith or personal opinion rather then
fact. Personal opinions are subjective in the classic sense; they completely
depend on the point of view of the observer.

IMO: That is why you see so many IMO's prefacing posters' comments.<sic>
