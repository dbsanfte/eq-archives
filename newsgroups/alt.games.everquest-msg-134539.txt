OK totally unrelated question, why do a lot of people do this? I mean,
nothing much goes on a whole lot above the horizon, and it is called HUD
mode for a reason - everything is heads-up. I even know people that have
everything arranged exactly as it is in windowed mode.

Why the original text box was at the bottom of the display was always a
mystery to me, so being able to enable heads-up mode and stick it where I
can read it and still see what I am doing in the background was a beautiful
thing. I keep a lot of things at the top where they are easy to get to while
in the middle of combat, which is when you are moving at your fastest pace
and timing is crucial, I keep things where they are most convenient for me
to see and use them quickly.

I also hotkey like crazy, and use the alt keys for spells (why make a hotkey
for something that is already hotkeyed?) because clicking them is just not
quick enough.

Just a question of course, because what works for one person may not work
for others, or any for that matter.

Yeah but once you are, they'll be a lot easier to identify and much easier
on the eyes than those harsh solid colours. There's nothing like snaring
yourself when you are trying to get off a sow.
