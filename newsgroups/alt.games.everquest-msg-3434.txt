Arguably, you have the best pre-100pp 1hs weaps already although others may
chime in otherwise.  My warrior used dual langseax's until his 30's.  I
would stick with them until the 'damage cap' is lifted at 20 and see how it
goes.

If your 1hs/2hs is maxed I would try to boost your 1hb/2hb if at all
reasonable.  There are some nice blunt weapons out there and you'll thank
yourself, or me <G> for having practiced them early on.

Grab better AC/hp items when you can, and try not to fall into the
wurmslayer trap unless you exclusively solo.  That weap is more trouble than
it's worth.
