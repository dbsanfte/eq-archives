Well I got my response from my e-mail.
They said they couldn't find any record of a centi longsword in any of my
characters saves so I am out of luck.  They did say I could reply to their
e-mail but is there any point?
Keep in mind, my roommate BOUGHT me the centi and I've been trading out weapons
to determine which was best, the "wurm / lammie" combo or the "wurm / centi"
combo so I have witnesses to what I had.  The "wurm / lammie"  combo won, so at
least I still have my weapons of choice.  But i sure could have used that
plat...
I guess my only question would be "how many "saves" does verant keep?"  This
would be valuable for future reference.  If they only keep a few it might save
someone ELSE from losing their equipment....
