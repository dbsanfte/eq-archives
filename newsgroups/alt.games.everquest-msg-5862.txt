There are some sites which have guild listings, but I've never paid that
much attention to them.

Generally, you can ask the person who's doing the invite for their guild web
site.  Most guilds have their own.

I never accept the "drive-by" guild invites.  I prefer someone to actually
talk with me first and get to know a bit about the guild and the people
before joining.  Same thing with those who shout out to the zone that
they're looking for more members....if they accept just anyone who wants
in...it's not for me.
