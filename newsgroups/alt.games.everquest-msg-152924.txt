I think that would piss people off as much as GM events usually do, since
the typical GM event is of the "spawn a mob in a zone that is waaaaaay too
low level for it" variety.

Although...Ragefire in QH might be OK, because most people there are low
enough that an unressed death won't bother them, and are probably bound near
enough that it won't be a major inconvenience.
