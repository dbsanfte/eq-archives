right to me.

One thing I've noticed since I've started playing again, with the
original plus Kunark and Velious, is that when you start a new
character in Antonica you are pretty much on your own.  Yesterday
I ran from Innothule, where I was tired of killing frogs, which
had myself and one other player in it, to South Ro, where I was
on my own -- one person in the zone, through Oasis, where again I
was alone -- imagine that, go to Oasis and be the only player
there, into N Ro where there was one other player, and into E
Commonlands where I finally found two other people who wanted to
kill orcs.  What a drag.  The game is designed to encourage
grouping and social interaction, but there's no one left to group
or interact with.

Are Luclin and POP so freaking great that people no longer play
the original game?
