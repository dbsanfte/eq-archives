I wasn't talking about hunting there, meant using the bank there and
stuff.  And a brell gnome can go from ready to attack to warmly in 10
levels. I know its a bit much, but I had fun. Includes annilating
warrens with area effects when passing thru. Tho most of that (dubious
to warmly) was in 2 levels at highland kobald camp. 2 nights worth of
hunting btw. Died once :(

ah well, screw it, don't go. My mage can solo most of the big stuff in
Stonebrunt now, so don't need any of you whiners there to ruin it. I
jsut know how it was in early 20's trying to get a group there with it
empty, feel sorry for those guys.  

Just wait until you have to go thru Stonebrunt to get to Luclin,
should liven it up some.  And if they sold water flasks at the cat
outpost it would be ideal for smithing and pottery. Lugging it up from
Paineel is a pain but doable. And honesly, I hope they don't make a
gate to Luclin. Teleport pad only would be great, and ironic.
