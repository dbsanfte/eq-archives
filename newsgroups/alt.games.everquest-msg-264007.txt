Instant problem with that is potential griefing.  Blocking people inside
structures (SWG had a problem with that), keeping people from getting to
a zone line, etc.  Collisions are great when you don't have to worry
about other people using it to grief (such as in flight sims).  In an
MMORPG, the evil side of it will come out.
