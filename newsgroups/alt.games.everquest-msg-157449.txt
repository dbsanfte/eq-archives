No they won't..

They've been patching like this for sometime and they actually moved the
patch times to start in the Early hours PST instead for 9am PST...this made
it far better for Euro players than it was when patches were finishing at
10pm GMT.

I take it this is your first time at seeing an Expansion go live then? Wow,
you should been there for the Great Luclin catastrophe :�)

EQ Expansions are like a new born foal, they wobble and fall over a lot at
first making some people sad and others laugh. Then the get on their feet
and start running, only falling over occasionally :�)
