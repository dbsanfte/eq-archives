Helps to know what level you are, if you are sub 45-50 then Crafted is
about the best. Alteratively depending on which faction you go for
Guardian is decent and so is Royal Frost Velium. Also hook yerself up
with a guild and get some indo from hate. Or start working on Cobalt
:) It an Indo are by far the best on a human imho.

Personally I am working on a full set of Myrmidons atm, long way to go
though. Only got legs atm.
