I know that this is old, and forgive me, but I just saw a documentary on HBO
the other day about Bush during the campaign, 'Journeys with George'.



A registered Democrat made the doc., her mother is a Democrat congresswoman
and yet the film shows a caring, humorous, self-depreciating (sometimes),
intelligent man.  He cared for this young reporter named Alexandra, and did
something that ol' Slick Willy and Cardboard Gore would never have if they
didn't think that it would help him.



She mad a mistake, not a horrible mistake, but she asked the press corps who
they thought would win.  Somehow that poll got leaked and was printed in the
press.  It said that Gore would win.  Bush, by all rights, had every reason
not to talk to her, joke with her, or spend time with her (which he did on
and off the camera).  He came up to her after the shit had settled and
talked with her about it.  He offered her some rather sanguine fatherly
advice.  "When they see me talking to you, they are going to act like your
friends again, but these people aren't your friends. They can say what they
want about me, but at least I know who I am and I know who my friends are."
(I don't think an idiot could come up with that little statement, and why
would he have Karen Hughes write that up for him to tell her?)  My god, the
man even has to go back into the bowels of the plane to break up a little
spat, and he does it well.  I doubt Gore would do that, and Clinton would
have been too busy eyeing all the young women (Oh come on, he's a
philanderer, how can you even say that he isn't?).

Bush came across as a caring and generous man in this film.  He had a soft
spot for this young reporter and it showed.  He wasn't slimy about it, it
wasn't about getting her in bed, it was just that he genuinely liked her and
it showed.



Regardless of what party you are registered with, I strongly recommend this
film.  I just looked at the show times, and they are all for HBO Signature,
sorry about that, you have to have Digital cable or satellite tv.  It should
be out in video soon, and I hope that a few people might decide to watch it.
I promise you that it is well worth the hour and fifteen minutes spent.
