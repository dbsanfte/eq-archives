Before the servers were dropped, I was able to confirm a few things:

Logged my lvl 6 necro and overpulled badly (on purpose).  Respawned closer
to Cabilis with all my gear.  Found a naked corpse in FoB.

Getting crazy XP ... killed an even con with the assistance of a pet and got
almost 2.5 blues.

Just sitting reclaimed mana as fast as opening the book.  Dinged 7 and just
sat down ... med skill started going up.

Then the world came crashing down.  More to follow.
Crash
