I did find the info on how to start the trials in PoJ, I am more interested
in what is required groupwise to do them.  Given that the guild I am in is
currently equipped with mostly pre HoT gear, trying to find out if it's even
possible to succeed.  I can easily get a group of level 60-62 people, have
the following available:

Ranger - 62, 61, 60
Enchanter, - 61
Wizard - 61, 60, 60
Shaman - 61, 60, 60
Rogue - 61 (maybe, currently shipped off to somewhere in the middle east,
so, probably not), otherwise, 56 is highest
Druid 61, 60, 60
Cleric - 62
Mage - 59
Monk - 60
Paladin - 59, 59
Shadowknight - 62, 61
Warrior - 60, 59

Of all of them, only the 62 Ranger is equipped in better than HoT gear
