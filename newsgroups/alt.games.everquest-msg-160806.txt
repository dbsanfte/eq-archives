|Increases your max hit, id say thats more than "nothing"

	Nothing increases your max hit.  I hit for 91 max with Earthcaller at my
unbuffed 199 STR, my self-buffed 226 or raid-buffed 255.  Your max hit is
capped by level.

|Still got the log?   Maybe I wrongly recall it being 1 minute, I didnt think
|TS lasts for 2 minutes

	I read it on Google.  It's 2 minutes exactly.  Trueshot, which does last 2
minutes, falls just as Klandicar bites it.

|Why is it?    RC to xxxxx is like VT to James.

	No.  The game keeps advancing.  Who is best at minor encounters is
unimportant in the long run.

|And walling him at zoneline just seems like an extra long pull (with no
|apparant benefits)

	It is easier for some skilled pullers to get one mob to the zone line than
for a raid leader to move forty goofballs on a public raid who can't get from
point A to point B without incident across half a zone loaded with hostile
mobs.
