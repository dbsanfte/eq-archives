Yes, but that was not their main name.  He called them halflings as if in
reference to something known from elsewhere.  Sorry if that is not so clear.
It's like if someone was to say "Yes, eq halflings are really hobbits".
Everyone would know that you meant that they were hobbits as defined by the
Tolkein stories.  In the same way it seemed like in his stories he was
saying hobbits are like halflings.  A type already defined elsewhere.  My
point is that halflings are not owned or defined by Tolkein since he seems
to have gotten the idea from somewhere else (not sure where).
