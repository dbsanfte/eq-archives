Hello,
   I have 7 HQ cat pelts to sell and i was under the impression that they
were fairly valuable, however i have had no luck in trying to sell them, I
put out the /auction and thats it, i recieve no response at all. Can someone
tell me if they are still a sought after item or am i just wasting my time.

   TIA,
      Crassius - Lvl 20 Magician - Rodcet Nife.
