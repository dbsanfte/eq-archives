Yes, amid all the crys for revenge via mass slaughter abroad and
vengeful hatred against those considered "different" here at home, with
all those crying "Forward, from the rear..", a bit of contemplation upon
the words of Pinky are in order.  Perhaps these...

And as the windshield melts 
My tears evaporate 
Leaving only charcoal to defend. 
Finally I understand the feelings of the few. 
Ashes and diamonds 
Foe and friend 
We were all equal in the end.
