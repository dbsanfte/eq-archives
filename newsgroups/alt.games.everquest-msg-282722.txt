One of my earliest memories of EQ is grouping with a bunch of people in the 
Oasis when I was in my teens.  A sand giant walked towards the dock.  We all 
scurried to the end of the dock to wait for it to go by.  I was in the back 
of the group and carefully watching the giant to make certain it didn't 
aggro.  As it patrolled down the beach, I noticed that everyone in the group 
was slowly turning in unison, their eyes fixed on the sand giant, carefully 
marking its progress.

It kinda struck me; all these people from computers in different parts of 
the world, and a sand giant caused them to unintentionally but precisely 
synchronize their movement.  One of those "whoa" moments that made me marvel 
at the intricacies of online gaming, at how we were all experiencing this 
thanks to signals moving at the speed of light back and forth across the 
world.

Hard for me to articulate all that.  =)  But I still remember that moment, 
even years later.
