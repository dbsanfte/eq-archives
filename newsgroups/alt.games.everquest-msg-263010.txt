We have 2 warriors in my guild, both with BOW's (our guild got 3 BOW's from 
3 RZ raids :), that I regularly group with. Both were lvl 65.
One of them (warrior A) I can land tash as the warrior lands the first blow, 
and he consistently holds agro.
The other one (warior B), I have to wait maybe 4 seconds, and even then I 
often pull agro.

No way is that just damage. Warrior A obvously has some huge agro taunt 
ability.
