His complaint is it'll come down to a race of 15 people to get the
first blow in on the rarest spawns. Furthermore, its very open to
exploit in that if you are of a level that cannot kill the mob that
you can simply figure out a way to get the fastest blow in, even if
that means hacking the client to provide a means to cast faster than
human response time... and then let the other 15 people smoke it while
you loot up.

Hope you are right.

Heh.. living in a dream world Neo. 14 year old kids usually have
parents that work, with money. Enough to have bought them a computer
and be online. $13 bux off daddies credit card? Nothin. And hey, look
at it from the parents point of view, its way cheaper than a
babysitter.
