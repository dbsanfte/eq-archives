It is time for me to finally upgrade my computer, and I figure I might as 
well do it right.  I'm planning on building it myself, and running XP on 
it (I know, I know, but I HATE WinME).  I've got a decent idea of what I 
want, but I would appreciate any pointers you can give.  I have about 
$2000 set aside for this, but I expect that I'll come in signficantly 
under that sum.

Power Supply:	375-400 Watt (enough?)
Case:		Mid-tower (Are they all the same?)
MB/CPU:		Need help here, thinking Intel P4-2Gig or so, I've seen
		the videos of the AMDs catching fire when the fan was
		removed, so leery of AMD.
Memory:		768M-1G, but what kind?  
Video:		GeForce4 4400/4600 as available
Disk Drive:	80Gig or so fast IDE, SCSI not worth the cost for me
DVD:		Whatever is new and fairly cheap
Sound:		No idea here, good luck with Turtle Beach in the past
Display:	Either existing 19", maybe a new 21", or a 17" LCD?
Others:		Standard floppy, optical mouse, keyboard, 100Meg ethernet, 
		etc. 

I'm looking at some of the gaming systems that are available commercially, 
and I'm getting ideas, but I think they add a lot of stuff that I don't 
want or need.
