Is this your ranger you were playing?  If so, use Harmony, it is an awesome
spell.  Get close enough to see the spell effects on the mobs, but not close
enough to aggro.  Cast harmony on an orc in the center of the camp, watching
to see that it affects all the orcs.  If it does not, cast harmony on
unaffected ones, until all are affected.  Now, pull one at a time, starting
from the orc closest to you.  Unless the orcs are right on top of one
another, you will get one at a time.  Harmony is your friend when breaking a
camp.

A couple of possible explanations for the different results, when you did it
before, the orcs were farther apart, or possibly, all the other orcs conned
green to you, so did not aggro on you.  Whereas in EC, they were both close
enough together, and did not con green to you, so they all aggroed.
