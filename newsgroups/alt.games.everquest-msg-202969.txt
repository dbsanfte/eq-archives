Just wanted to point out that a low level druid has excellent grouping
potential, argueably better than any other class. Your heal spells are
still good enough, everyone wants sow, your damage shield on a tank is
still very useful, you can break camps (outdoors) with Harmony, you
can snare runners.... Druid is argueably the most wanted class in a
group under 40th lvl. 

 It does admittedly change at higher levels, not as much because they
aren't useful but because good grouping druids aren't all that common.
Random_druid_427 that nobody knows probably won't get a pickup group
easy. A druid that people know is compentent rarely seems to have that
problem. In other words, use the early levels to make friends!

Rgds, Frank
