My iksar monk has never been jumped (except by frogloks! Grrr) but after
millions of bonechips, is merely amiable. He was ally to wood elf guards
until that was nerfed, and that was so easy it made my head spin. I think
with the right illusion, i could be near ally to dwarf clerics with bone
chips, but i can't ever imagine getting that high a faction with my own
kind, i think that they are just hard to impressss!
