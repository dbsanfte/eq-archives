    During the 50's, my SK regularly out-dps'd wizards, but got nowhere near
monks.

    During the 60's.. wizards seem to kick just about everything bar
rangers. Considering damage is about it for wizards, I think they should out
damage rangers too, and do it consistently from level one through to 65. But
that's just my opinion.

    Pulling..... as a feign puller I normally end up pulling for every
single group I get. Not every mob can be pacified, and pacify can fail
resulting in an unmanageable train.

    Mobs remember you more often (in fact most of the time) at higher
levels, but you've still got a chance each time you feign of being
forgotten, and can keep at it. (I'm guessing you knew that already). You
also get another (Bigger) chance when static spawn mobs get back to their
spawn point and reset. (I'm guessing you knew that too though)

    So yeah, disagree strongly on two points there, I would almost NEVER say
no to a monk wanting a group, purely based on dps. And occasionally having
another puller around is useful... hmm double tags anyone?

    Regarding tanking..... yes monks can no longer tank worth a good god
damn, and as a class that is aimed at the same 3 things monks were: dps,
tanking, and pulling, being better than monks at one of them finally is a
relief.

    In other words, quit ya winging ;)

Cheers,
James

PS As a side note, is monk gear so expensive because so many monks are the
twinked alts of people with a lotta money?

PPS..... my take on soloing with pure melees is:

* Do not solo with pure melees * ;(
