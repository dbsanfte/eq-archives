Sorry, but you are rehashing an old discussion that many folks consider
to be closed, the folks who agree with you and especially the ones who
don't.  You will have no luck in getting the folks you are discussing
this with to see your point and can expect to be the recipient of
insults and derision if you insist on trying.  Since folks can inspect
it became considered to be a right.  Despite any arguments you can
provide that in a role-playing sense you have a right to be offended, or
any other reason for your feeling the way you do, so long as there is a
method in game to do so they have the right to do so whether you like it
or not.  I totally agree with what you are saying, just pointing out the
futility of saying it here.

Personally I have a social macro I can easily access if I'm in the mood
to enjoy being inspected since I don't have the option of not being
inspected.  Yes, I can turn off notification of the inspection message,
but by that same token those who are targeted when I hit my macro have
the option of using chat filters or ignore if they don't want to see
what my char may have to say on the subject.  Its much less frustrating
than trying to explain concepts of personal space and the social
limitations of "because I can".  While asking me what an item is would
be my preferred method of interacting with those around me there are
other options available  and I for one will use them "because I can"
<EG>.
