Really Stan?  I've been around since the *very* beginning.  Brad used
to write me, personally, Stan. I also pre-date your idol, bizbee (and
most of the other current NG hosts, btw), so put that in your crack
pipe and smoke it, Stan.

I'm known and KFed (I'm proud to write that.) by most of the "post
from work like it's a chat room" crowd.  I've KFed the majority of
them myself because they bore me with their constant flames and
condescension.  I've read the kind of posts you write thousands of
times.  On my home news reader, you're KFed because you're boring and
have absoulutely nothing of value to add.

Of course, I'm boring and have nothing left to add either, it's all
rather pointless these days isn't it Stan? That explains my "only 20
posts" doesn't it, Stan?

My unwillingness to get involved in every flame feast and my refusal
to post from work all God Damn day long, rather than actually working,
doesn't disqualify me from having an opinion, Stan.

Back in the day it wasn't pointless though.  I was there, you weren't
so na-na, neener fucking neener, Stan.

I've exchanged personal, informative, helpful, polite emails with
almost all of the Verant development staff (including *Brad*). I've
seen my suggestions (I'm sure I'm not the only one who made those
suggestions) implemented in the game.  You see Stan I *was* there.
I've *done* that.

Whether or not some Johnny-come-lately is aware of myself or not,
doesn't mean jack shit me, Stan.  So I promptly bitch slap your ass
for acting as though you're somebody and I'm nobody, noob.

I am amused that you *wish* you had *my* time in game and in this NG. 
Stan, it's no big deal, get over it, you're nobody and *always* will
be nobody.  If nothing else I'm infamous, you're *nobody* and always
will be *nobody*.


Posting a lot from work doesn't make you anything more than a nobody
slacker at work, Stan.  So just KF me, and keep chatting it up with
your fellow nobody slackers, Stan.
