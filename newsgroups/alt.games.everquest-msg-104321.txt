I use an IBM R30 Series laptop (1.1GHz PIII) for work. It runs all but
the more busy zones in Luclin relatively well, and the old world zones
just fine. I DO have to turn everything down graphics wise tho, as the
chipset in the graphics card is running  8MB (Bleah to Trident
Cyberblade, what were IBM thinking)

I suspect if the box had 512MB my zone times would drop by maybe 500%
too. Damn my cheap company.
