lol jealousy is such a nasty thing... oh wait, you forgot to flame me for
"bragging" about my 56 cleric, even though you asked if i had one...

5?  shrug.. the only characters i've ever said that are 50-60 are the monk
and the cleric, I never mentioned the SK's level (just that i'd pleveled it
some)

My original char was a magician, he got to 50 then deleveled some on a bad
naggy and pof raid, was never pleveled, and still kinda shitty gear.
Next came my monk, 60 and never power leveled.  Cleric - never power leveled

Your talking baseless opinions.  Primary healer for one or two melee types
for a period of time is what I do with my SK almost every day.  I speak with
current experience, you just speak opinions and try to reinforce them with a
few insults here and there.

I switched from using divine line to complete heal at about level 35, at his
current level with about 2.8k hp, believe me when i say NOTHING comes close
to cheal for mana efficiency.

My argument about cheal drawing a lot more agro then celest is crap? Lol you
are the one who keeps on talking about cheal drawing too much agro.,.. wtf
you talking about now?

Yup, I know it.. i also took it to another level that you did.  My monk got
to 60 without uber gear or power leveling, so when you talk about strategy
as though your the ingame master tactician, guess again buster.  Have you
even done King/Juggs in Sebilis?

Celest on a main tank isn't a good idea if the mob is a hard hitter, and on
a buffed 50-60 warrior (id say between 3.5 and 4.5k hp) an 800ish heal over
time isn't gonna make any noticable difference in HP during the fight.

I made the decision whilst power leveling my SK (yes, me controlling the
cleric and SK) that once I was needing more then 1.5k HP heals, Cheal was
the way to go.  before that, divine light was almost like a cheal... id cast
it at about 500hp, and the 900ish it heals would virtually take me to full.

Now when I cheal, i get 2.2k to 2.4k heals from the cheal (about 2700 or
2800 overall hp) depending how late I leave it.  I need to heal once every
other fight or so, so tell me how celestial heal is more mana efficient then
that?

Divine and celest both eat the mana up far more then a cheal thats used at
the right moment.

Substitute the WFP zoneline for the giant fort in GD, and we have the exact
same kind of situational fights.  Now you stop and think before you post
again... what you basing your claims on?  because mine are based on what I
have personally seen and done in my time in EQ
