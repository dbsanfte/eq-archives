Known limitation... ISTR there's a 200 item limit on any search... alpha,
price or vendor... and that some non-stacking items on the same vendor will
take up 1 slot each in the results (so someone with 10 sacks of the same bow
can take up half the slots in any search)

Smart buyers narrow the searches by specifying race, class, slot (and stat,
usually Int/Wis/mana for casters)... or use the keyword search.
