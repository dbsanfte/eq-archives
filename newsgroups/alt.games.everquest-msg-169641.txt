I love Volvo wagons, I've had 5 of them so far.  Never tried the diesels 
though.  The one diesel I did drive was a Mercedes.  Lovely car, but 
hardly sporty, it took forever to accelerate.

Oh, they're safe.  They're very, very safe.  They've always been near 
the top of the list as far as safety.   The newer ones might be more 
reliable... But the ones I've driven, and those of other Volvo owners I've 
talked to, needed a lot of love. :)  They're very easy to work on though.  
Nice big engine compartment, easy to reach parts.

If you look at consumer reports April issues, where they rate all the cars 
in terms of how trouble-free they are, Honda and Toyota regularly come out 
at the top of the heap.  Especially the Civic and the Corolla.
