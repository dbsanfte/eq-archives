Pay the $50 to move your character over to the Karana server, and I'll sell
you some cured =)  Yesterday, I was doing odd things around the freeport
area ( and ran the stein quest twice ), and did /ooc's for the price of
Cured Silk ( so I can sell all these that I am making ).  Noone would answer
me.  It was 3 hours before someone told me 3pp / AC.  Mind you, I was in EC
( our auction zone ) a -lot-.  If someone /ooc's a PC on something, and I
know the price, I let them know, either in tell or /ooc.  I don't know why
people can't take the time to send a quick /ooc to respond to a price check.
It seems, by their replies to PCs, that they are only interested in replying
to the big-time items and arguing the price in open channels when someone
says differently.

I even did what I consider a no-no and sent tells to random Monks ( levels
15-25 ), asking them if they knew the price.  I always did it very politely,
and begged for their forgiveness for intruding like that.  None of them
knew, and I asked at least 5 of them.

I did buy some Wu's stuff from a guy trying to trivial them.  He was selling
them for 15pp each.
