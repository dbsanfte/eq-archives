Way I see it leveling quick isn't a big secret, it's all about being 
efficient. No downtime, no idle chit chat between pulls, either fighting 
or pulling. Perhaps FD when the mob starts to run and let you partner 
finish the mob off while you're getting a new one. Keep your partner on 
kei at all times and make sure he uses extra mana for nukes or dots. 
Stay away from anything that's light blue, hardly gives any exp (I 
didn't realize how extremely little they give until rather recently, 
never ever exp off light blues!!). Don't invite more people into the 
group than there are mobs to kill, no point in having lots of dps when 
you have to wait for mobs to spawn. Casters need to watch their mana, 
make sure it's never at 100%. They also need to know which spells are 
most mana efficient. Avoid places that are too crowded. Dungeon exp 
bonuses help if you can handle the dungeon (which you probably can since 
you can FD pull). Stuff like that.

One of the reasons I suggest a duo is that it's easier to get 2 people 
to work together well than it is with 6. Another reason is that you'll 
never run out of spawns (in most places at least).

Might seem a bit trivial to some people but thinking back I realize that 
it was in my 40s I even started thinking about stuff like that. Chain 
pulling in groups was rare in groups at lower levels for example. Now at 
higher levels most groups work efficiently but for me this is something 
that has come gradually from around my 40s.

Remember to have some fun sometimes too :) ..
