a.g.e has fairly big scope.. all things "everquest"; that includes 
Everquest, its expansion packs up to and including everquest: dragons of 
norrath, the sequel: Everquest II, EQ: Online adventures (PS2), 
champions of norrath, Lords of Everquest (the RTS), the Mac version, the 
PalmPilot version, merchandise, cellphone ringtones, and anything else 
related to everquest.

If somebody wanted to ask about who Sony contracted to make the 
Everquest themed Cigarette lighters or watches this would be the place 
on usenet to ask. 

(The answers to that Q btw would be: "zippo" and: "I don't have a clue", 
respectively)
