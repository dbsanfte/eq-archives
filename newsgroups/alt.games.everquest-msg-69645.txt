I have downloaded the latest greatest drivers recommended for a Voodoo 5500
pci (1.08).  Since Varent in their all powerful wisdom decided to ax the
OpenGL/Glide settings in EQ we have been forced to use the D3D portion of
our cards.  Does anyone out there know what the optimal 3dfx tool settings
are for playing EQ with the drivers recommended by Sony/Varent.  When we had
the option of using OpenGL the 2x anti-aliasing was the best choice.  Now is
seems that the "Best Performance" setting is better.  Anyone else got any
tips on what to set up these new drivers with?
