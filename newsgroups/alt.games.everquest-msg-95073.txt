You all have always given me really good advise.... My friend, who is a
lvl19 druid, has a wisdom problem. When she created Amneeack, her very first
character (who btw she is very attached to so no starting over) she didn't
put a whole lot of points into Wis. Now she is starting to wish she had. I
am trying to help her find good WIS gear at bargain basement prices. I
finally convinced her to go to High Hold pass because that's where I made
some pp, but she's broke for now. I know about the prayer cloth quest in CB
( I'm giving her bracer of battle for this quest), but I wonder if there are
any other WIS. item quests for someone her lvl. Thanks in advance, I feel
responsible I got her hooked!
