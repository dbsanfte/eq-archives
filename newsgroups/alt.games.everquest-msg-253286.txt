i cannot see how this could be considered an exploit,
you are not taking advantage of any bugs or pathing ,etc
if the game desingers or those that make the rules consider
it an exploit then change the rules so guards instant kill?
poor guard hunters hehe or make the mob not give exp
once a guard has hit it.or make it none tagetable once a guard hits it.
