EverQuest meets the Matrix.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was late at night. Neo sat at his computer, sprawled out over his
keyboard in a death like sleep. It had been two weeks since he had left
this
spot. The chair reeked of his own filth, and the floor around him was
littered with pizza delivery boxes. The joys of EverCamp.
Suddenly his screen went black. Instantly he awoke, hands already on the

macro's, auto attack on. "Had I been blinded?" he asked. He had heard no

spells being cast. After a moment of silence, he checked to see if his
monitor was on. It was...and then horror struck Neo. "Not my Voodoo
card!!
NOOOOO!!!" But his fears were quickly washed away when suddenly DOS text

appeared on his screen.
Wake up Neo.

"Huh?" he said.

The Vision(TM) has you.

"What?" Neo asked. He hit the esc key.

Knock Knock.

Suddenly their came a knocking sound on the door. After a moment Neo got
up
and opened the door. A middle aged man was there, look about anxiously.

"Your late," Neo said.

"Yeah yeah, sorry." The man said. "I got the cash, you got it?"

"Yeah...hang on." Neo said and went back into his room. Going to a
bookshelf
he pulled off the EQ manual and took out a scrap piece of paper.

51st DE Necro
Name: Darkdeath
Pass: phatlewt

Neo returned to the man at the door, and traded the paper for a wad of
cash.
He put the 2 grand in the EQ manual and closed the book.

"Man, your my savior, my own personal Jesus Christ." The man said.

"Yeah well..if your caught using that..." Neo began.

"I know I know...I got him off of Ebay." The man looked at Neo in
concern.
"Dude, you look a little pale. You alright?"

"Yeah..." Neo replied. "Its just...did you ever think...do you know that

place between being awake and asleep?"

"Yeah...all the time....Evercamp man, best **** for that." The man said.

"Dude, maybe you just need to get out. Why don't you come to the cyber
cafe
with me. Mad EQ tournament going on."

"I...EQ? Oh okay" Neo said.

---

All the computers were in use when Neo arrived at the club, and being
the
antisocial person he was Neo just stood in the corner doing nothing.
Suddenly a woman came up to him, the first ever that he had seen since
EQ.

"Hello Neo." She said.

"How do you know my name?" Neo asked.

"I saw it floating above your head." She replied. "Your in danger, Neo."

"From what?" Neo asked.

"From them," she replied.

"That is the most completly vague answer I have ever heard in my life.
In no
way at all am I even remotely concerned for my saftey because you have
given
me nothing to base my fears on." Neo said. "Whats your name?"

"Trinity." She replied.

"THE Trinity? The one on Tallon?"

"Yes, thats me."

"Jesus Christ, I thought you were a guy."

"Most guys do."

Trinity came up to Neo then, and began whispering in his ear. "I know
what
it is that drives you, Neo. I know why you live alone, and why night
after
night you sit at your computer. Its the question that drives you, Neo."

"What is the Vision(TM)" Neo whispered.

"The answer is looking for you Neo." She said, then with a smile turned
and
left.

BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP

"Oh ****!" Neo said waking up. The alarm said 9:15.

After he arrived at work, his boss quickly called him into the office.

"Mr. Anderson... there seems to be a problem. When there is a problem
with
an employee, there is a problem with the company. If you can't get over
your
EQ addiction and come to work on time, then don't bother coming to work
at
all. Understand?" his boss said calmley.

"Sweet...I'm going home then." Neo said.

"What?? No no I'm saying don't come back ever!" the older man said,
looking
angerly at Neo.

"Alright. I got a camp to break anyways, later."

And with that Neo left the building. After he returned home he logged on
to
EQ. Suddenly he got a telepath!

Gorden tells you, "Hello, Neo."

Neo: "Gordon..."

Gordon: "Yes....I've been looking for you Neo. Do you want to meet?"

Neo: "Yes."

Gordon: "Very well."

Suddenly Gordon appeared in a bright flash of light, fully decked out in
his
Necro gear.

Gordon: "Welcome Neo. It is an honor to meet you."

Neo only stared in awe. "Your actually real.."

Gordon smiled. "I bet your feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the
rabbit hole, hrm?"

Neo: "Sorta."

Gordon: "You have the look of a man who accepts what he see's because
he's
been playing EQ to long. You're delusional from lack of sleep and have
lost
focus on reality. You lost your wife and job to EQ, and soon your mind
will
be gone as well."

Neo: "Yeah..thats pretty much it."

Gordon: "I bet you have some questions for me."

Neo: "What is the Vision(TM)?"

Gordon: "The Vision(TM) is all around us. Its everything. From the
Paladin's
broken quests to the Necro's getting so many over powering items they
don't
know what to do with them. Its the 1000k fall bug, and the teleporting
mobs.
Its the world thats been pulled over your eyes to hide you from the
truth."

Neo: "What truth?"

Gordon: "That you are a slave, Neo. That your only purpose is to give
Verant
your money. You are in a prison, a prison for your mind."

With a sigh, Gordon leaned back.

Gordon: "Unfornantly, no one can be told what the Vision(TM) is...you
have
to see if for yourself."

Then Gordon pulled out two pills and showed them to Neo.

Gordon: "Take the blue pill, and you wake up in your chair, and think
whatever you want. Take the red pill, and I show you how deep the
bullsh!t
goes."

Neo began to reach for the red pill, when Gordon stopped him.

"Remember, I'm only offering the truth. And Alchemy is fixed."

Neo, with a shrug, ate the red pill.

Gordon: "Follow me."

The two men entered the next room. It was fully decked out with the
latest
governement gear, including a full VR imersion chair. To this Gordon
directed Neo.

Neo sat down into the chair while Gordon pulled the helmet over him.

"Buckle your saftey belt, because Reality is going bye bye."

Suddenly Neo was hit with incredible lag, as the zone was loading. After

about 10 minutes, he found himself in East Commons. Gordon was there as
well.

"Your in MY world now. The world thats been pulled over your eyes. In
reality this is what it is."

Suddenly the beautiful graphics were replaced with a conferance table of

middle aged men. A sign on the wall said Verant.

ManA: "Customers 12321-90322 has paid their 10 dollars."

ManB: "Excelent."

ManC: "Sir, Wizards are complaining about how bad they suck."

ManB: "Bah...nerf Rangers so the wizards shut up. As long as we get the
cash, it dosn't matter."

Neo: "No...no this can't be!! YOU LIE!!"

Gordon: "I'm sorry...this is the truth."

Neo: "NOOOOO!!!!"

Gordon: "This is the reason the GM's don't help anyone. To delay them as

long as possible so that they pay more. I will be honest with you Neo.
No
one has ever convinced a GM to help them. But where they failed, you
will
succeed."

Neo: "What are you saying, that I can dodge spells?"

Gordon: "No Neo....your a ranger..you couldn't dodge a dead horse. But
imagine if you could."

Suddenly a GM appeared. "Neo, I'm going to have to ban you. You're
hacking
into the system."

Neo: "What?

GM: "Unless you can prove otherwise..."

Neo: "Um...GO TO HELL!!"

Suddenly Neo let out a volley of arrows, firing off one after the other.
The
GM dodged quickly, and all but one missed.

GM: hit by non-melee for 1 point of damage.

Then the GM countered attack with a heavy melee. Luckily the ranger was
a
speedy and dodge like warrior, just as the Vision(TM) had declared them
to
be.

Neo: You have been HIT for 300 damage!
Neo: You have been HIT for 300 damage!
Neo: You have been HIT for 300 damage!
Neo: You have been HIT for 300 damage!

Staggering from the blow, Neo fell to the ground. The GM stood above
him,
prepared to finish him off, when suddenly Gordon placed his hand on the
GM.

"Dodge this."

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" the GM shouted as the 20,000 life tap spell
instantly destroyed him.

"Ah, I feel better." Gordon said.

Neo blinked in amazement.
