My mage made his first trip to Crystal Caverns (I know...old news....but it
takes a while to get around to every zone in the game) and I thought "Wow!
This is a great zone."

It has a bank, vendors and guards.  The tentacles and crawlers are easy to
solo...spiders and orcs to a lesser extent (gang-up on ya).  I haven't
explored further but am looking forward to it.  It sucks that you can't bind
there but I guess that would make it too easy.

Anyway, is this zone considered a dungeon ala exp bonus?  Thanks.
