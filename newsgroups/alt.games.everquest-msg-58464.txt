Before getting to the Cel vs. CHeal thing, I'll remind you that there's
three clerical buffs that do. Against blue mobs that give xp but really
aren't wailing the crap out of me, we save the reagents and skip the
symbol line and go with armor of faith and resolution. (Yes, they
stack).

Without logging back in, and just going from memory, I believe that with
zero buffs on me and with all my gear, I have a base HP of around 2050.
With the two buffs above I believe I'm in the 2400 range. Throw in a
symbol and I'm up in the upper 2K but below 3K range.

Now with all these questions, it certainly merits more testing. That's
for sure. The "math" for it as laid out here certainly makes it look
like CHeal should *always* work better. But I'm not basing this on
something I read on a web site or figures on paper. The decision to use
Cel against certain types of mobs came from trial and error, as Tiru
described in another post.

If it's a hard hitting, fast swinging mob, then yes... CHeal is
obviously the only way to go. But also remember we spent a good bit of
time doing Seafuries waiting for the AC camp to open or just grinding
some easy xp to get Tiru to ding fifty. They are the lightest hitting
mobs of their level that I know for non-casters. (average around 70). We
pulled them to the waterline and fought them there. When Tiru used CHeal
in those fights two things happened:  First, it was a while before she
could safely sit down again without getting whomped on. (Cleric not
sitting = cleric not medding = Bad Thing). Second, we would win the
fights, but she'd be down to half mana or worse, particularly if the
rogue needed a shot of healing as well. (Not to mention a shot for the
cleric who attempted to sit after CHealing and got whacked on.)

Conversely, if she waited until I was down to a little over 1/2 health,
then dropped a Cel on me, she could sit down immediately, and it was
able to not only keep up with the damage a seafury does, but usually
stay ahead of it so it was a good while before I needed another one. And
she *never* drew aggro. Fight would generally finish at around 75 to 80
Mana for her and I'm off to pull another one as soon as the first goes
down.

No, on paper it doesn't look like it works. In practice it did. And
remember, we aren't talking about big hitter end-game mobs here, and
we're also not talking about full groups. I think the unusual
circumstances were what led to the discovery that Cel was very much
better than CHeal in some circumstances, but it was certainly the case
for us. I probably haven't gotten five CHeals in the last month except
against Alizewsaur, and it's really worked out. Personally, I think
Celestial has gotten a bad rap in the EQ community and people don't use
it because of what they've heard. It's really worked for us.
