At 60 I lost a full yellow.  That may not be exact, but how close do you
need it to be when you hear that? <g>

At 64 I lose about 6% but it takes me a few 96% rezzes to drop down a
percent in post-rezz experience.  But with a 96% rez you really only need to
kill about 1 dark blue critter to get back all lost experience so I really
pay little attention to it (I just die often enough, so I do notice it
eventually :p ).
