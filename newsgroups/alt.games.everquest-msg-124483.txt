You're welcome to believe in psychics, Buddhism, psychic surgery,
Judaism, telekinesis, Christianity, chiropractors, divining,
communication with the dead, pet psychics, Islam, magic, auras,
Amway, crystals, telepathy, make money fast, magnets that help
you heal, fortelling the future, alien abductions, that the moon
landings were faked, Nostradamus, and Zeus all you want.  I won't
stop you.

Knock yourself out.  I'll stick with being one of those terrible
close minded skeptics.  Thanks.  :)

That doesn't look like agnosticism to me.  That looks like you're taking the
stance that religions are bunk.

Except that you seem to only be skeptical when it comes to things you don't
agree with.

Yes, and I didn't dismiss that possiblilty.  The difference is, I try to
keep an open mind, which allows for both my religion and others to be
possible (I believe only one to be right, but I can offer not proof that
it's the one I believe in).  If any religion is correct, it must be backed
up by science.  That means there can be no room in science for the bias that
casts it's shadow over the field now days.
