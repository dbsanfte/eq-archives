It seems to have been a really bad problem lately.  A fair number of people 
were reporting finding insane amounts of cash in their bank or on their 
person, and LDing as soon as they tried to click on it, then, 1018ing for a 
long time, and finally getting back in and finding their cash situation 
back to what it was before the problem started.  I LDed last night with no 
such issues, and it took me quite some time to get back on, which is 
unusual, I can usually log back in within a minute.  As with most of my LDs 
in the past few months (not very many of them), it dropped me to the server 
select screen, implying that my network and internet connection are still 
good.  This implication was further reinforced by the fact that it 
determined that I have an active character online still when I try to get 
back into the game.  There seems to be a definite problem at the moment, 
and has been for a while now.
