Not to mention the fact that sometimes things go wrong.  Overpulls,
resists, AFKs, adds...all kinds of things can get the situation out of
control.  A knight is often a better option.

...one reason Rangers often don't even worry about AC and pick gear
and AA's for hitpoints first and AC second.

...And don't forget when the Shammy (worse yet the Enchanter) gets a

For my own curiosity...is fire less often resisted than magic in BOT? 
As a matter of fact, do any of you lurkers know if anyone studies or
publishes info on the relative resists for different zones/mobs?

Very good point.  With my usual ~5200 HP, pulling in BoT, a nuke or
two and a few smacks and I am already close to 50% HP.

LOL, I often go without a rez or put it off til the group breaks up...
 Who cares?  It's not like I'm going for level 66.

I have seen Warriors do a good job making up for their lack of aggro
tools, to the point where it made no difference 95% of the time.  But
that doesn't change the fact that knights have a huge advantage.

...yeah but I would be happy if we could just mitigate at least as
well as the damn monks.  Ah well, at least I can outdamage most of
them now.

LOL, 60-->65 was *much* easier than 50-->55.
