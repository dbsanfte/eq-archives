There's at least one of the chest traps that takes 3 casts of
disinfecting aura to cure, but I haven't seen one that DA doesn't
cure. I think DA cures 18 counters so you're probably looking at 40+
poison counters worth of cures. Not sure if they changed it but at one
point the lower level traps were just as hard to cure so triggering
one was pretty much a guaranteed death.
