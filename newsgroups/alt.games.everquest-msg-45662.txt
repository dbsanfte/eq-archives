I have a HEF druid with 170 wis at level 35 and here is what I wear

2 forest loops
Chrysoberyl Talisman
Velium Ruby veil
Nightshade Wreath
Braided Ivy Cords
Uthrok hide arms
Foreman's tunic
Velium Jasper Rings
Gatorscale Leggings
Mammoth hide cloak
Burynai Hide boots
Splitpaw Hide gloves
Charred Guardian Shield
Velium Stone Etched mace
Crystalline belt
2 Chipped Bone Bracelets

As far as what drops it go to http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ and look in
the items section to see what and where it drops.
Not all this stuff is the max I can get for wis in that slot but the best I
could find. The druid got 90% of the stuff himself by working his butt off
selling ( wheeling and dealing in EC )
Needless to say soloing is easy and grouping is even easier =)

In Crystal Caverns now having a blast
