  Ah, this whole thread takes me back to my glory days in EQL.  Back when
there were weekly patches, usually on a Tuesday or Wednesday, that were
supposed to last for two hours but usually lasted for six or more, with
frequent emergency patches to follow for a day or so after.  It happened
pretty much every week, and it never failed to generate a "Servers down,
WTF?!!!" post or two or more.  

    I'll give the same advice that we gave back in the day.  This is how it
works.  We don't like it, but some of us like the game well enough to deal
with it.  If you don't like the game well enough to deal with it, vote with
your feet and unsubscribe.  Whining, stamping your feet, and anguished
teeth gnashing, while quite amusing to watch, really won't do a thing to
help the situation.  

Honestly, it won't.
