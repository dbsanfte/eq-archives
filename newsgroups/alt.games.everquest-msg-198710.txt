They are nice quests but most of the rewards are not worth it.

You really need a tracker (druid, ranger, bard) to help track the named
mobs that drop the items because theya are random and usually wander.
You just have to keep killing the mobs until the named one spawns.
For instance if you are looking for "A Frenzied Wolf" you have to
keep killing wolves until he spawns. Also shout out to the zone the item
and mob you are looking for, people will usually let you loot the item if
they kill the named one you are looking for.

The quest mobs spawn in:
Tenebrous mountains
Dawnshroud peaks
Mons Letalis
Scarlet desert
