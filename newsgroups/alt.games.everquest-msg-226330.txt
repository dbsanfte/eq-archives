I guess the point is that the people buying LOE just to play the beta are
doing so of their own free will.  Are you against them being given this
choice, or are you against them taking it?  Me, I'm fine with it from that

it appear to be doing better than it really is.  It cheats the stockholders
of an honest portrayal.
