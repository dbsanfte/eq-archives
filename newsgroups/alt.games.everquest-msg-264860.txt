I was never a big fan of the AD&D ruleset personally.  I played it 
because that's what some of my friends played, and, ultimately, the 
ruleset was not all that important to the quality of play of a RPG.  
Personally, I much preferred Chivalry & Sorcery, and Fantasy Hero for 
fantasy RPGs.  When I was GMing, I tended to use Hero Systems for 
fantasy, Bushido for a Japanese fantasy setting, Traveller, and later 
Hero Systems for Sci Fi, and Champions (first hero system game) for 
superhero settings.  I have tried many many different systems, and AD&D 
just never did much for me.
