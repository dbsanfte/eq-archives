go to this ridiculously well designed and constructed website and check =
out the album for sale there.

Thanks a lot. It is about me I think and a fair artistic document of the =
world from 1995-2002 when the world was plunged into deception which =
curiously happened the same time I became mentally ill and iced on =
neuroleptics so basically my mind has been frozen from 1995 and just =
woke up last year and it took all last year to recover and I am still =
recovering but am actually doing much better, I see that I have retained =
much of my former vigor although a shadow compared to myself as a teen =
and what I could have done if given any support at all by anyone, almost =
as if God wanted that to happen so I would be outside of the world at =
the breaking point and could see impartially that humanity was about to =
die. I wrote a paper in High school concerning art and the health of a =
society by comparing Roman society at the time it was going to fall =
(which I got a C- on incidentally) and I basically predicted that =
America was going to fall very soon (which I got a C- on incidentally)I =
think the professor of my psychology class could tell that something =
rather insidous was happening when he sat me next to another guy who =
seemed to have no interest in other people and could not tell or even =
notice when people were interested in or liked him.

I think I have High Functioning Autism, but I have never had that =
diagnosed by anyone

I would also check out the film "Vulgar", I think it may have also been =
inspired by my life, and may have a picture of what I really kind of =
look like embedded in the film somewhere that isn't too hard to find.=20

I hate to be an arrogant whiny drunken clown ice cream man toady but it =
could also be said that the last three Star Wars movies were and are =
loosley related to my life and maybe someone else's life too of rather =
notable importance, and that the Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker character =
may decide not to choose to be evil in the end and hopefully help =
construct and design an army of robotic soldiers to be controlled =
remotely by children who think they are playing a computer game who will =
utterly decimate the clone army and Anakin will have his robotic arm =
fixed and him and Padme will ride down the main street of the city on =
some kind of a gargantuan beast and get off and be given medals along =
with anyone who helped by some droll looking tall white haired bearded =
man or how about that annoying Italian characture with the flies around =
him, maybe he could be the mayor of the city, yeah they could come back =
to the city Anakin grew up in, the conquering heroes who saved the day =
in the end and when Anakin looks around sadly and realizes there is =
still something missing his mother could emerge out of the light having =
been cloned, an ironic twist that cloning could be used for good or evil =
just like every other technology since the beginning of time. Then there =
will be a big celebration and the movie will end, hopefully to some =
music that is slightly different than the same tired John Wiliams Score =
except for the Emperor's theme which should be used as liberally as =
possible. I actually think Vin Diesel, Otto Ittenger or even Kevin =
Smith, lol or some other young and upcoming director should direct this =
film too and I think pretty much everyone would agree with me who is of =
any real importance in this world. All I'm saying is that you've got one =
last chance to get it right dood or you may find that people won't =
continue to think that you are the greatest filmmaker on earth anymore =
even after making 2 uninspired films which admittedly were excellent =
anyway, I guess we want to see what you are like when you are firing on =
all 8 cylinders instead of 2 or 3, just barely getting by from day to =
day looking for the light at the end of the tunnel that never appears =
finding that your creativity has been crushed by misery and delusion =
caused by constantly encroaching fears of your own competence and the =
silent barrier that is erected from being hurt over and over again until =
you no longer trust anyone and eventually you die from lack of affective =
contact when you fail to let anyone in at all anymore, trust me I've =
been there, technically I am there now, but somehow I am being slowly =
healed. Yeah, you should direct the 3rd film and pretend it is your last =
because it may very well be, I would go all out if I were you or you =
will be remembered as a slacker by a generation of slackers who still =
hold you in regard at least I do. I think I first started my filmic =
education with Star Wars which I saw 7 times at the Century 21 theatre =
in San Jose, which is the second largest theatre in town, actually the =
center portion of the Century 22 is the largest. I don't know I actually =
loved episode 1 and 2 of your sextilogy, I eagerly await episode 3, =
almost as if the fate of civilization rests in the outcome of your tale. =
I guess my version would have some incongruities between the end of 6 =
and the end of 3, I guess he has to become evil(I gotta go to bed)

just click on the link above and buy a bunch of copies of the cd and =
throw them in the garbage after saving one to listen to. I guess I'll =
stop bothering you when I find someone worthwhile to talk to in real =
life which hopefully will not be long as I have been mostly talking to =
myself, the voice in my head even keeps reminding me that I am just =
talking to myself and that I currently have no real outlet to share my =
thoughts and feelings with and if it remains that way that I am going to =
die, and I can tell that is very true.
