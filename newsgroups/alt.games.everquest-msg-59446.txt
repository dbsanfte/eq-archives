Limiting pulls is the nature of the game, what are you talking about?  You won't

be quad kiting in dungeons... not that you have quadding spells yet at 31 any
more than I do at 30.

Bard should have sung his faction song to the RyGorr if anywhere in the
vicinity of the fort; I've gone up to Avengers and tried to get quests off
of them as a level 19 bard.  Getting killed once is no reason not to go
somewhere, there is a learning curve to these things.  CC is very likely
your best bet if its really a dungeon you want, though why a druid would
voluntarily cripple himself without a specific goal in mind is beyond me.

Why on earth would a druid grind exp in a dungeon?  Get outdoors where
you have SOW and Harmony and plenty of running room if its exp you
want, better yet, concentrate on animals, which give you charm and
fear as extra toys to work with.  For a Druid, indoors is strictly for loot
or because there's a party you want to play with and -they- happen to
be going indoors.

Ogguk is the closest bind point to Feerot.  Course the warrior has to
count on you coming in to camo him to get out of there... but I assume
you will bind in there alongside him, so if you happen not to die when
he does, this won't be a problem.  For belt and suspenders approach,
have him make an ogre alt, and hand that alt a couple invis potions.
Now if you crash out and can't log back on for the night, he can always
come up to the zone line area (no wandering guards there, safe spot
to bind) and drop the potion on the ground, log back in as naked warrior
and pick it up.

As above, Feerot now the closest bind spot.

Any places like this are worlds better for you as a druid, you get the other
half of
your spell book back.  I've been doing Ulthorks on the north shore in EW
recently,
until someone hired me to get him a HQ Tundra Kodiak pelt... now I'm hunting
wild game across the middle of EW, in Camo until I find something I like.  400pp

a pelt is hard to resist.

Cougars do drop earrings, but very rarely.  Dire wolves I can't think
of any reason to toy with at all.  You should be looking for "barely red"
stuff, not "been blue since I was 26" stuff.

Have you tried Tizmaks in GD?  Thats an "outdoor" dungeon, rarely
crowded, doable with harmony and a good tank.  Drops are hardly
fantastic, but you might, depending on race, like the Tizmak armor,
or at any rate the cured tizmak, if you are untwinked; further, keep
an eye on track for Yaka Razorhoof, his hammer is a pretty nice
toy for a druid.  Level up a little more, or get that bard some lessons
in how to be a bard, and you can move up to Kodiaks there.
