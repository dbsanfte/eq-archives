Well engulfing darkness can be stacked with your other DoTs but it will not
do double damage if you cast it twice if that is what you are talking about.

No, engulfing darkness is the upgrade to clinging darkness so it will
override the clinging darkness.

Hmm...  Hard one to say since I play a necro and disase clouds is my L1
spell.  However I could see a use for it for SK's, cast disease cloud to
prevent your mob from regening health during a long fight sounds like a good
idea?

Necro pets get duel wield at L29, summon dead, (need to arm him with 2 1HS
weapons) and automatic duel wield at L44+, cackling bones, and a small life
tap spell.  I don't know what pets SK's get but they are the skills pets get
at those levels.


> 5) Should this pet fight bare knuckled?

It probably not worth your while unless you happen to have a spare rusty,
bare knuckle is good unless your pet can duel wield then you should try to
arm him.

Oh yeah for SK's this is a really good spell, it increases your attack
points and for tanks that is always good!  Grim aura is available at most
necro/sk guilds such as FP and Neriak.

Hmm...  Good idea to get some of your skills up in the different classes of
magic such as evoc, alter, abj, conj and the like.  Most of your DoT's will
be alteration and your pets conjuration and your DD's evoc.  Good idea to
get these skills up so you don't have to waste your mana pool fizzling to
get your pet and even more annoying fizzling during a fight when trying to
cast DoT's or your DD.
