ok i do have all expansionpacks so yes i cantravel fast, but for my latest
toon i've set the goal only buying what is available on vendors. (standard
inventory so no sales from ppl wich end up on vendor) armor and weaps
crafted and quested just to experience part of what the initial population
of norrath suffered in the old days. With the advantage that i can travel
fast and use resources like the mighty allakhazam and other good
documentation. I must say my beastie is lvl-ing slow but all skills are
maxed out where it concerns fighting. Still need to work on tradeskills
though, but it is rewarding to know i'm not a supertwink and still making
progres.

happy hunting
