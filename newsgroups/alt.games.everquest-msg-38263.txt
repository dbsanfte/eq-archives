This is hard for me to admit, but my enthusiasm for EQ has dropped
like a troll off the Dragon Bridge.

Many of my own personal goals have been realized: I have reach the
35th season, I have joined a guild, and my wisdom has been much
improved (186).

I am hardly weeping for lack of worlds to conquer. There is much I
haven't seen or done. I want to solo a hill giant. I want to pick up
some gatorscale leggings and a crystalline belt. I want to learn how
to quad-kite.

And yet, when I log into EQ, I wander around for 15 minutes, do a few
ports, then camp.

Part of the problem, I suspect, is that I haven't chosen a hunting
ground. I'm bound in OT now but OT doesn't seem to be a good place to
quad-kite. It's a great place to group, but I don't seem to want to
group much any more (so much so that I'm considering changing my
specialization to Evocation from Alteration). 

Quad-kiting cougars in Iceclad or Tizmaks in GD is supposed to be fun.
However, Iceclad I never really enjoyed and GD has a lot of nasty
wandering mobs. I suppose I could hunt dwarves in BB, if they're not
horribly overcamped. None of this sounds appealing.

Quests for halfling druids of Karana are sadly lacking. The only quest
that seems interesting is the Paw quest, and I can pretty much
guarantee that camping the Fungus Mutant for hours on end will
permanently kill my EQ enthusiasm.

Starting a new character is a possibility, but that too just doesn't
grip me.

Does anyone have any suggestions on goals, hunting grounds, etc.? Is
it time to walk away and water my long-dead plants?
