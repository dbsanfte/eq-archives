No, but I'm hoping they're all on my server. Be nice to clean out some
of the clutter.

It's three bucks a month, guys. That might be greedy in large scale
business terms, but to you it's one less Big Mac and a coke. Get over
it. If it's too much, then you are fully in your rights not to play or
pay anymore. Not dissing you on your right to quit. But sheesh. Three
bucks? 

Yes, it could set a "slippery slope" and go to extremes, but it's still
way less than my cable or ISP bill for something I use a lot more than
watching TV, and tied for the highest use of my ISP service. Personally
I don't think it's that much. Wish they didn't raise it, but it's not at
any sort of "Fuck you. Too much. I quit" level.
