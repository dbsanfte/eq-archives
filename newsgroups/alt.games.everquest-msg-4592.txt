First, pets are what make mages so powerful (I have a mate that is
lv60) and if you don't like pets then play a wizard or some other
class.  To do well you should make either the best pet you can at each
level.  At lv6 your lv4 pet spell will give you at the highest a lv5
pet, thus all pets at lv6 and 7 will con blue.  To find out if its a
"good" one simply send it to kill something green and see what the max
damage it does as this is another way to see what the level of pet you
has (see http://magecompendium.com/ for a table of pet level and max
damage).  Also, if you give a pet a rusty 2H weapon like a 2H sword
with 8 damage, your pet will hit for a maximum of dam x 2 or 16.  If
you are a human mage in Freeport there is a dealer in SF that will
sell you all the rusty 2H weapons you want.  At lv8 you get a summoned
staff that can also be given to the pet and with it they hit for a
maximum of 14 dam if I recal.

Flare does no damage but is useful for finding a pet or someone you
are grouped with as it will go towards whatever you target.  Fire flux
is an AE spell and only does damage to monsters right next to you and
is generaly not very useful.   And yes, wizards have no pets and must
do all the damage themselves so generaly do a bit more damage than a
mage but not by much.

Dont worry much about your malee damage, it't not important as you are
a pure caster not a tank.  You can summon weapons that are just fine
and for like 50pp get a walrus tooth, dragoon dirk, or other nice
weapon that adds a few stats and hits magical.

Mages kill blues, even, yellow and even some low reds from lv4 to
lv30.  Above level 30 you wont be killing solo anything but blues for
the most part as the con system changes.

I suggest first get a good pet and if its lv 16 or less give it a
weapon, even one of your summoned staffs if thats all you got but any
weapon with damage of 7 or higher.  A rusty halaberd will give you a
pet, even a lv4, that hits for 20 dam max!  Don't bother giving lv20
pets weapons as they already hit for 20 or more and once you hit lv24
then to lv34 give your pets two summoned daggers as they need them to
dual hit.  Lv39 to lv60 pets dual on their own and weapons, unless
they proc some useful spell, are not needed.  I suggest you start with
an earth or water pet as earth will root and help keep them off of you
and it has the most hit points so lasts longer and the water pet is
immune to poison so is super against any snakes or spiders you see and
its health comes back the fastest.  Fire pet is good mostly against
lower level blues as it has less hit points and air pets have the
fewest hit points are are best when grouping where they wont get hit
much but can cast stun and goes invisible which is nice when hunting
in dungeons.  

Start by pulling a single monster with your best damage spell, send
the pet and wait until it is hit a few times, then cast once or twice.
If the monster is not dead step in and malee and get close enough that
you are getting hit as by now the pet my be low on health. A quick way
to check is to hit F1 key twice and you will see what the pet's health
is, if good then step back and meditate until it kills and if not keep
it alive.  Generaly, if the pet dies the mage dies or at best needs to
finish the fight while being hit.
