    If drops only cost 5 points each, then it'll take forever for the 50 DKP
person to catch up. And that's assuming he does catch up, if Mr. 100 Points
still raids more than Mr. 50 points. It's an item costing issue. I look at
the people in the other big guild on my server, Vis Maior. They have a
points system. And the same people in each class kept on getting the loot,
as they played more than the others in their class and the points difference
between play times was enough to purchase all the top-end loot they wanted
without losing that points advantage.

    Then, recently, that guild had a dispute internally. Remember I
mentioned destroyed AoW pants? Well, apparently some of the guild's
membership had their doubts about whether the GL had destroyed the pants,
too. Nearly the entire officer core left the guild and formed a new
"hardcore raiding" guild, Explicit. So Vis just lost 15-18 people, all of
them the best geared people they had. Um, whoops.
