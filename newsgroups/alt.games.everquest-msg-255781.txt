Some spells have varying durations based on the level of the caster, KEI 
probably wasn't a good example... except that how am I to know that it 
isn't?

And what does that 5% add up to anyway?

IF KEI is 60 minute duration, then 45% extended is 87 minutes, and 40% 
extended is 84 minutes, so its  3 extra minutes.  But if its 90 minutes 
base ( I really don't know ) then you're looking at 130 minutes 30 
seconds and 126 minutes, or 4 and a half minutes difference.

Neither is a big deal of course... but my point is that without knowing 
the underlying duration and then doing the math, its hard to see what 
people are advertising really.  Since the game now provides us with the 
means to tell precisely what duration the buffs are, why not simplify 
everyone's life and hawk -that- instead of putting out confusing and 
difficult to verify percentages...

Unless of course you're one of the nefarious people who've been getting 
away with inflating their buff duration extension percent claims, 
already hard hit by the ability of their customers to see if they are in 
the ballpark (or to verify it exactly if they happen to have the 
formulas and data worked out), but looking at this last vestige of cover 
provided by the average person's general ignorance or laziness.

Hmm, I guess thats one other reason not to switch; do you want to favor 
the lazy or the dishonest?  Neither route a winner!

Grage, seeing the worst in people for 45 levels, feeding my rage with 
your deceit, Berzerk on Luclin
