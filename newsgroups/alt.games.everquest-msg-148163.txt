 Ok here's what you do. Write down all the Options selections and list all 
your hotkeys for the character that can't gate to Velious, you're going to
need to redo it all. Backup your <char>.opt and <char>.ini files (where char
is the name of character that can't get to Velious) or just copy to another 
directory and delete the files from your EQ folder. Restart EQ and try to 
get to Velious with that character. If it doesn't work, copy the *.opt and
*.ini files for that character back into your EQ folder as my fix didn't 
work. if it DID work, set up your options and hot keys all over again and
have fun, then delete the backed up *.opt and *.ini files for that character.
 
 This sort of thing happened to me a while ago and worked for me. Apparently
the *.opt and/or *.ini files for some characters get corrupted somehow when
you try to gate sometimes. Deleting them and starting over fixes it. You may
want to think about backing up you *.opt and *.ini files for all your characters
occasionally when they are working correctly. This way when they get corrupted
all you have to do is delete the screwed up ones and copy the backups back in
to the EQ folder and away you go.
