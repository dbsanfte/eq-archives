Argumentum ad populum - A proposition is held to be true because it is
widely held to be true or is held to be true by some sector of the
population.

In the case I'm actually discussing, the initiating comments was:

"Every porter out there assumes that their equivalent port is going to
be just fine when it comes to Faydwer." This statement was put forward
to support the position that even though BBM is not GF, it is "close
enough".

By assigning a trait to "every porter", the poster was attempting to
bolster his position. 

Not only is this a logical fallacy, the statement isn't even correct
at face value - not every porter assumes her alternate port is "just
fine".
