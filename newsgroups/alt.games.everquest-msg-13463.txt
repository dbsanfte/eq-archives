I'd like a bit of vision to be maintained; I've heard enough about
other MMOG's where everyone ends up playing one of three different
character types (my tank mage healer comment referred to that)

Exactly. You're good at nuking, I'm good at being mediocre at
everything :)

Balancing as much as possible is good, but I don't think of the need
for difficulty ratings as a cop out. It'd be boring if every class/
race combo was as easy to play as, say, a halfling warrior. It doesn't
really make sense that the pure nuking class has to be one of the
difficult ones, though.

It can be more easily justified for necros than for wizards (Using
unholy arts on their own minds). Yes, it's a grouping bone, but it's
one they needed. A wizard couldn't do the same thing - wizards usually
don't have mana to toss around to other classes instead of nuking.

What would you think of the mana nuke I suggested in another post?

It seemed to me that you wanted to improve the class purely by taking
abilities (such as mana drain) from other classes in the name of
balance, based on how upset you got when people pointed out it'd be an
enchanter thing. And I consider wanting things other classes have
class envy.

You can't expect every cleric to be a fransiscan. Clerics channel the
POWER OF GOD, so why shouldn't they be able to inflict some hurt with
it inbetween all the healing? If you want an unbalanced class, it'd be
the healer with no means of defending himself.

I concur.

So the conundrum is basically how to make wizards better without
making them #1 on every mob hatelist, and without turning them into a
hybrid of a nuke machine and another class.

Heh :)

Then again, a bad mage can be worse than a bad wizard, and face it,
the only robed one that is truly wanted in most groups is the
enchanter.
And good wizards can be very nice. I was in a group a while ago with 2
or 3 wizards, 1 tank, and me as a healer. We mowed through giants with
only a couple med breaks between kills, and me and the tank were
closer to exp sponges than the wizards :)
