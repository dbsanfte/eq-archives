I figured I needed a little bit of backup proof since I stated it was fact.
I did a quick look up of what it said online for dictionary doing a yahoo
search of dictionary recession and definition and picked the 3rd one down.

this is quoted from web page:  http://users2.ev1.net/~kaden/Pages/Defs.htm

"Financial dictionaries offer a slew of other characteristics of
depressions, such

as falling prices, excess of supply over demand, rising unemployment, rising

welfare costs, an abnormally high number of factory closings and layoffs and

consumer fear and caution."

notice excess of supply over demand.  exactly what I was previously saying.
