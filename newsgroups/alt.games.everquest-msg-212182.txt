Yes.

Basically, whoever loots the scroll has to do the last third of the epic,
including farming shards in Skyfire, killing Ragefire, and looting his
heart.  When they get back to the Hidden Island, they get the last of the
three orbs.  They turn in this last orb while the other cleric turns in the
first two.

So it's a lot of effort to go through on the part of the MQ-er, but it can
be done.
