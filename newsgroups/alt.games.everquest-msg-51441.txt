It's actually as effective as quad kiting.
I tested out (yeah, so I was bored shitless one night), counting the
number of blue kills using quad kiting vs. root/dotting over a period
of one hour each.

They came out about the same (the difference can easily be accounted
for by resists).

Remember, druids, until they hit level 56 have two distinct types of
root:  The fast casting, short lasting, easy to break one.  And the
slow casting, longer lasting slightly harder to break one.

Check the various root spells that druids have.  There should be ones
that cast in 1.8 seconds and ones that cast in 2.5 seconds.  It's at
level 56 we get the best of both worlds:  fast casting, long lasting
and somewhat difficult to break root.

Level 49 is the 2.5 second variant.  It can hold for damn near 3
minutes against blue cons.  

Level 56 root is basically level 49 root, +30 extra hps of damage, -25
mana cost and casts in 1.8 seconds rather than 2.5 seconds.
