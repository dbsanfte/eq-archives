Hell, I can do that as a ranger.  Just snare it on incoming.  I find snare 
is more aggro even than a resisted slow.  Snare twice and I'm golden.  If 
I'm not tanking then 1 snare is enough that unless the slower is seriously 
underaged for the mobs then they won't grab aggro often, and the tank can 
usually taunt it off without me taking more damage than a single quick heal 
from the cleric can fix.

It is *very* rare that I see the slower grabbing aggro off either an SK or 
a Pally.  However I somewhat prefer SKs for the group mana/health feeds, 
ATK taps, and snares (meaning I don't have to remember to do it).  That's 
not to say I'll wait for an SK if there's a pally LFG, just that I find I 
get more utility out of the SK's various taps.
