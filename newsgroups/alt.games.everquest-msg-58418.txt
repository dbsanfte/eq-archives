My first advise is: Get some levels. Lots of levels.
Jewelry is damn expensive to get up and the first things you can make are
pretty worthless. It won't get interesting until you can make +wis, +int and
+str stuff. And by the time you can make those things (already a couple of
pp further) the other players around your level don't have enough cash for
those things or wait a level or two more and buy the better version.

I am currently waiting till I have 2500kpp to take my Jewelry up to 180
skill in one serious blow. My plan is to get all my int gear on (208 int
right now, can be more) get a chanter with high cha to buy the stuff for me,
buff me with Brilliance (+13 int) and race through the skill-levels. I am
now lvl 50...

As for the rest: www.eqtraders.com has lots of info, with links to places to
get the info which isn't there.
