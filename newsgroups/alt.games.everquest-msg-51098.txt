Okay.  Perhaps he could.  If so, this is evidence of a saturated economy.
Not of a stable and flowing economy.  Depending on the age of a server,
there will come a time when this statement is very well true.  Perhaps it
has already come on some servers.  If the economy becomes so saturated with
both money and items and money is devalued to the point that new, low level
characters become as rich as the upper crust in a very short period of time,
well *that* isn't a *good* economy.  It is essentially a lack of an economy.

If the government, tomorrow, decreed that pebbles and leaves were to be the
new currency, well, then everybody could just walk outside their house and
pick up an ungodly amount of money.  Now you might initially be under the
impression that everybody is stinking rich, but they are not.  Why?  Because
pebbles and leaves are so common that they are worthless.

Now, to continue that example... if there were suddenly enough cars, and
food, and VCRs and computers etc.. etc.. etc.. for everybody that wanted one
to have one, and they would never wear out and never break, then well, that
might be a fantastic world to live in, but it wouldn't make for a flowing
and stable economy.  It would make for a complete LACK of an economy and
everybody would be happy.  Fine.  Then we could all go fight monsters for
entertainment, and if that is what we enjoyed doing, we'd be that much
happier, and that is what we have in EverQuest.

I'm not saying EverQuest's poor economic model makes for a bad game.
Obviously it doesn't, but it does define the sort of game that it is.

Easier for sure, depending on at what point you enter the server's economy.
See above.

Right.  You did a wonderful job of rephrasing my statement here.

Right.  The problem is the determination of that value.  Money is almost
worthless to the level 60, especially if that 60 has been on the servers
since its inception.

The bottom line is that there is no need to defend EverQuest as a fun,
addicting, wonderful game.  It is.  Regardless of the economic model, you
will always be able to log on and fight monsters and get cool items.  But it
is futile to defend the economic model.  It was poorly planned, and is
horrible.  I enjoy the game immensely, but I learned very early on that to
enjoy the game I have to accept it for what it is, economy and all, and be
content with it.

If you want to add the dimension of economics and entrepreneurship to your
character you have to do it in another game.  This one is about killing
things.
