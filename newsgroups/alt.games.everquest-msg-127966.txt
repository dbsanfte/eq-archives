the fact that it's a kick ass bow? I rather liked how the system worked
in Dark Age of Camelot. Up to level 30 drops are common enough that it's
not hard to get whole sets (unless you're like me and horribly unlucky).
after level 30, tanks must have player crafted armor and weapons (or
quest items), and casters can simply buy the best items. 

At least until they put in a new craft set that lets players put stat
upgrades on their creations. Then literally anybody can get the abolute
best items in the game simply by having the gold, which after 35 or 40
isn't that hard to come by.

Furthermore, unless the character is within a handful of levels of using
that weapon or armor it loses usefulness and degrades faster. For
example if my paladin is level 24 and is using a red con mace that gives
11.3 damage per second. Because of my level caps, the real damage might
only be 7.9, and furthermore because it's too high a level for me (red
is two "cons" higher than that char should use) it might lose a
durability point every single monster rather than every dozen.

Imagine equipping that windforce at level 70 or whatever and finding out
it only does 40 - 150 damage (or whatever) because that's the max damage
weapon your character can handle.

did any of that make sense? :)
