Some DVD's are blocked from captures (often the DVD player s/w will have a
feature for it) and I think that includes using print screen. I am trying to
remember which DVD I own is like that, off the top of my head I believe it
is The Matrix, can't remember tho and I have no idea if this is common
practice or not.
