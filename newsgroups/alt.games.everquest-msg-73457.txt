Actually, one enchanter can.  It's hectic but doable with or without
the snake stick.

If it's a raid that requires crowd control, it can get tight, and
sometimes people have to go without a certain buff for a few mintutes.
 But if it's one of the crowd-control-proof high end raid zones (i.e.
ToV) it's trivial.
