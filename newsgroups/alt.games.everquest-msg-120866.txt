I was afraid of this, yes offense and my weapons skills are both maxxed
until the cap is lifted. With SK buffs I can get my ATK to around 1000.
I'm using a mithiril 2 hand (21/40 + 31% haste) which should be decent.
Given my low AGI would it be more beneificial to do as a previous poster
said and dump the AC rings for AGI/DEX rings, and concentrate on getting
those higher?
