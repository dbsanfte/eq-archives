Much as I'd like to be able to give you advice to solve your problem, I
can't.  All I've got to contribute is a negative, I'm afraid, which is to
point out (unless someone can tell me otherwise) that you can't downgrade
DirectX since it modifies Windows kernel components - once you're on DX8.1
you're pretty much stuck with it.

Other than that I can't make any suggestions.  Although 333MHz does seem to
bordering on a little slow these days, if you've run the game successfully
with the same configuration before I can't see why processor speed should
suddenly be making a difference unless something's been patched.  But if
it's any consolation at all, I'm running a 1.2GHz processor and an ADSL
connection and I still find I'm getting glitches and bizarre 'jump-cut'-type
slowdowns - and from time to time it's jammed up completely, forcing a
reset.

Sorry I can't be more help.
