search the web, i found a user written dx8 driver for my Voodoo3 Beta
card (Read Voodoo Banshee piece of shit).  I also usually delete
eqdevice.txt from my everquest directory whenever i update my drivers
for my video card, as i had problems with the cryptic "Error" message
that would cause eq to crash and that was what was suggested to cure it.
