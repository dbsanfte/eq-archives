No, there is no temper for making studs and bonings, just a quenching
agent as for all forged stuff. Instead of water, you have to use Morning
Dew, but this isn't a brewed temper, rather it is a foraged item.

Not that high really, between 68 and 86 for studs, and below 101 for
bonings according to EQtraders. If you've trivialled banded bracers,
these will be trivial too. They do need to be smithed by a wood-elf
though, and only in the cultural forge in Kelethin.
