Then you have to stay in Befallen, or head to the entrance
to either Paineel or the Hole.  None of the other doors in
the game become possible until 126 skill (the door in
E. FP), and some aren't possible until 201+ (FP Bank,
some Kunark+expansion zones) which isn't possible
until 51 and later.

Both Paineel's and the Hole's doors are possible to
pick >skill level 15, which is the earliest I've gotten a
rogue over to  pick the doors.
