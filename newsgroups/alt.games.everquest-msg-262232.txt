Somewhat.  Level 1 summons a pet that looks like you, attacks your target for
a tiny bit, and has 1K hit points.  It lasts a minute, but that almost
never matters, because it has 1K hit points.  Level 2 and 3 have more, but it
doesn't matter - it'll die if it has aggro for more than a round on most mobs.
More importantly, it shadowsteps you so you have a bit of distance from
your attacker.

Fire it off when mez resists or whatever and you're getting hit.  It gives you
an extra 1-3 seconds if you're lucky to get things under control, or for
someone to taunt, or whatnot.

Sometimes that's enough to save your life and your group.

The second.  It only lasts a minute even if it survives.
