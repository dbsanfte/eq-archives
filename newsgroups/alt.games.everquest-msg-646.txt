But a soloer can take on his max with a measurable downtime afterwards. 
A group can just keep pulling.  If you assume an 8 minute downtime for
the high-level soloer with low blues and zero minute downtime with a
constant stream of high blues to reds for the group then group
experience, especially with the higher multiplier, wins hands down.  Thus
grouping, for those in a hurry, is encouraged.
