Went out and improved my RAM, video card and processor so I could get SoL and
use the new models.  I'm kicking ass now with 1024 RAM and a 2.5GHZ processor. 
I log in and my Erudite Necro looks like he's got downs syndrome and my High
Elf Wizzie has red hair.  I had to come to work right away so I didn't get to
play around with it but somebody please tell me I'm gonna be able to fix this. 
Hate like hell to have spent all this money and then regret it because of new
models.
