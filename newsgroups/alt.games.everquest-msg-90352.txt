Southwest shall secede
from U.S., prof predicts
By Frank Zoretich
Tribune reporter

     Charles Truxillo, a professor of Chicano studies at the University of New Mexico,
suggests "Republica del Norte" would be a good name for a new, sovereign Hispanic nation
he foresees straddling the current border between the United States and Mexico.

     The Republic of the North -- he predicts its creation as "an inevitability" --
would include all of the present U.S. states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas,
plus southern Colorado."

     Stretching from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico, it would also include the
northern tier of current Mexican states: Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila,
Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas.
     Its capital would probably be Los Angeles.

     Truxillo, 47, has said the new country should be brought into being "by any means
necessary."
     But in a recent interview at a coffee shop near the UNM campus, Truxillo said it
was "unlikely" civil war would attend its birth.

     Instead, he said, the creation of the Republic of the North will be accomplished by
political process, by the "electoral pressure" of the future majority Hispanic
population throughout the region rather than by violence.

     "Not within the next 20 years but within 80 years," he said. "I may not live to see
the Hispanic homeland, but by the end of the century my students' kids will live in it,
sovereign and free."

     Truxillo said it's his task to help develop a "cadre of intellectuals" to begin
thinking about the practicalities of how the Republic of the North can become a reality.

     In the past, of course, wars have erupted when states seceded from either parent
nation -- including the U.S. Civil War to keep the South in the Union and, in Truxillo's
quick description, "the Alamo and all that" when Texas declared itself independent of
Mexico.

     Truxillo said the U.S. Civil War settled the question of secession militarily but
not in a legal sense. States do have the right to secede, he maintained, if -- as was
untrue in the 1860s -- the rest of the country is willing to let them go.

     Professors asked for comment in other departments at UNM were skeptical that
politics alone would find a way to make his proposed new nation possible. But, they
said, given 100 more years -- well, who can say for sure?

     "How realistic is it? That's one of the key issues," Truxillo said. "It's not
unfeasible as a premise -- and a realistic possibility when you consider global
geopolitical trends. It could happen with the support of the U.S. government."

     He listed a number of international developments that he said would have seemed
"far-fetched in the 1950s," including the breakup of the Soviet Union, the breakup of
Yugoslavia, the apparently imminent creation of an independent West Bank Palestinian
state agreed to by Israel, and ballot-box separatist movements aimed at achieving a
Quebec independent of Canada.

     The "tide of history" is moving the U.S.-Mexico border region toward political
autonomy, Truxillo said.

     Why does he think there should be a new Hispanic republic?

     It's an idea that has been suggested before. In the 1960s, during the height of
Chicano activism, something similar -- a sovereign Hispanic homeland to be called
Aztlan -- was proposed by Rudolfo Gonzales and others.

     When Truxillo was 14, he first met Reies Lopez Tijerina, leader of a group of New
Mexicans who seized the courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, the Rio Arriba county seat, in
1967. It was a protest against Spanish land grants being taken by the federal government
and set aside for national forests.

     In October, Truxillo was a speaker during a ceremony at UNM's Zimmerman Library hon
oring Tijerina when he contributed his personal archives to the library's Center for
Southwest Research.

     At the event attended by about 300 people, Truxillo said it was from Tijerina that
he had learned "that I was a member of a people with a country that had been taken from
them by war, a land that was our own by treaty."

     He listed a number of Spanish and Mexican treaties dating back to 1494 and ending
with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, by which Mexico granted to the United
States -- after the Mexican-American War -- possession of parts of what are now
California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.

     "None of the rights of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo were fulfilled," he told
Tijerina. "None of the obligations were upheld. You told us this was our country, our
patria, and that we should fight for our rights, that all colonized and exploited
peoples should rise up in struggle for independence.

     "We will one day be a majority and reclaim our birthright by any means necessary --
and we shouldn't shy away."

     Truxillo's tone was more scholarly during the coffee-shop interview. He said New
Mexico is the first "minority-majority state" in which Hispanics and Indians and other
minorities on a national level outnumber non-Hispanic whites.

     (U.S. census estimates of New Mexico's 1998 population: 52 percent Hispanic,
Indian, Black and Asian; 48 percent non-Hispanic white. The Hispanic population alone
was estimated at 40.3 percent. The 2000 census is expected to provide more precise
figures.)

     Texas is likely to become the next minority-majority state, Truxillo said, adding
Hispanics are already in the majority in the border regions of all the Southwest states,
largely because of a long and continuing immigration from Mexico.

     The "overwhelming bulk of Mexican immigrants are attracted by the American economic
way of life," Truxillo said. "Not as attractive to them is the American cultural way of
life, but they are willing to make the exchange of economic security for cultural
anarchy."

     Hispanics in the American Southwest "have been ruled by three empires, Spain,
Mexico and the United States," Truxillo said. "Under all three systems, we have failed
to achieve self-determination.

     "Among native-born American Hispanics, there is the feeling that we are strangers
in our own land," he continued. "We remain subordinated. We have a negative image of our
own culture, created by the media. Self-loathing is a terrible form of oppression. The
long history of oppression and subordination has to end. There has to be an
alternative."

     Truxillo, who describes himself as a Chicano, said he was born in Albuquerque. He
attended public schools in Albuquerque and earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees
from UNM, majoring in Latin American, borderlands and Asian history.

     He was an assistant professor of history at New Mexico Highlands University from
1992 to 1997, but after being denied tenure there, he began teaching in the Chicano
Studies Program at UNM where he is now a visiting professor on a year-to-year contract.

     Truxillo said Hispanics who have achieved some positions of power or who are
otherwise "enjoying the benefits of assimilation" are most likely to be in the vanguard
of opposition to his concept of the Republic of the North.

     "There will be the negative reaction, the tortured response of someone who thinks,
'Give me a break. I just want to go to Wal-Mart.' But the idea will seep into their
consciousness, and cause an internal crisis, a pain of conscience, an internal dialogue
as they ask themselves: 'Who am I in this system?'"

     Along both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border "there is a growing fusion, a reviving
of connections," Truxillo said. "Southwest Chicanos and Norteï¿½o Mexicanos are becoming
one people again."
