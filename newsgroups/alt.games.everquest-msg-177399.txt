That used to be what always happened when you reconnected rapidly after
LD'ing.  IIRC, when everything went smoothly a mage or necro could even
get back in before their pet despawned (obviously not for an LD that
happened while zoning).  But there was a dupe exploit associated with
the old LD behavior, so now we get the "you have an active character,
wait for synchronization" error and can't log in.  From your report I'd
guess the old code is still in there and your circumstances of the
moment slipped through some crack in the newer code layered on top.
