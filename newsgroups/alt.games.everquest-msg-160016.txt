This vah shir guide ran up to me while i was tradeskilling in rivervale and
i started to worry that someone had made a complaint about me (excess
alcohol production perhaps? not paying duty?) Suddenly, he handed me some
food and drink and fired fireworks at me. I was kind of stunned, didn't
quite get it at first, but then realised and did my best to thank him. It
was wild, it didn't get me killed, and it was rather pretty too. Something
to remember. Has anyone else had experiences like this?

Must get my gnome to learn tinkering! Those fireworks look like fun :)))
