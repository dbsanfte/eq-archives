I was going to run my lvl 10 Shaman through there earlier because I need to
get to Halas to help out a friend. I hate that place anyway, and when I saw
something like "The New Liberated Runneye" and more or less 'it's a bad idea
to proceed further', I thought I'd ask here... anyone know anything about
this? I know that they beefed up the mobs not long ago, but is this the same
thing, or did they do something different? Ok, going to check EqAtlas, too.

thanks to all
