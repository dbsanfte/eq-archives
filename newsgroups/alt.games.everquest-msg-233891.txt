My BF is usually ML in our group.  He sells *everything*.  We did 2 dungeons in
a row yesterday with the same group in MM, took about the same time.  One
dungeon our split was 43 plat each.  The other was almost 200.
What we've noticed is that in the caves the rats, bats and spiders don't drop
well.  No plat and not much vendor trash.  Non-animal mobs drop much better. 
And if you pick up 5 or 6 good gems it can be a really great split.  The
weapons sell for plat too.
I prefer almost anyone over a rogue, but I do always suggest they be master
looter if they end up in my group.   SOE needs to change the way pickpocket
works so that the whole group sees it.
