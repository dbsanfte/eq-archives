You can't run EQ full screen and make use of the second monitor. If you 
do you'll get full screen on one monitor and some fragment of your 
desktop visible on the second one, but you'll be unable to interact with 
it.

That's about the only relevant limitation.

Running in windows mode is more sluggish, and has other issues.

If you plan to 2 box, you can to it with two monitors and two windows.

But it would be better to just add another modest PC if you can afford 
it, even if you just plan on running a browser and IM client on the 2nd 
monitor.
