}>Hm?  I've always liked IBM HDs... what should I be warned about before my

}Well... It's an observation of many people, among them me and three of
}my friends, that IBM disks tend to have bad blocks from the day
}they're bought, and develop new ones on a regular basis. 

I've only had two, neither of which has even developed a bad block yet.  
Maybe I've just been lucky. :) Both of mine are deskstar type, one 8 gig, 
the other about 35gig.  Maybe they're also old enough to be before this 
problem?  Can't remember the exact model numbers.  Both IDE, though.

}New harddisks aren't supposed to have bad blocks _at all_, and disks
}shouldn't develop any until just before they die (after five-ten
}years!).

One of them is that old, but no longer in my possession, so I cant be 
sure.

}There's also this: http://www.tech-report.com/onearticle.x/3494
}The tech report is one of the last really reputable sources of info on
}the net, so their word carries weight. 
}Still, there's no hard evidence that the IBM harddisks have quality
}issues (so please don't sue me, IBM!).

My one real kvetch with them has been that they seem to insist, in most 
cases, on being the master drive on the primary chain, despite having 
jumpers that supposedly allow me to make them slave.  But that's been a 
comparatively minor difficulty.

Anyway, thanks for this info.  Means I'll have to do a bit more research 
before my next upgrade. :)
