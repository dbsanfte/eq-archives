Disclaimer: I have nothing against the idea, I'm just thinking
"out loud" as it were.

I'd like a more flexible system, but the thing I worry about is
the way it can possibly be exploited to make someone completely
unreliant on others.  I like class interdependence, I'd just like
to have the option to retrain (if you will) an existing character.

One possible flaw I see in your system is the ability of someone
to un-equip the gear that prevents them from casting long duration
spells (pets/buffs/summons) and then re-equip it.  I also don't
like the idea of someone having all skills at the same time.

To that end a couple of ideas:

1 - on skills.  At each level a person should get X number of
skill points and use these to purchase skills up.  There should
be no other way to raise a skill except by the use of these points.
Training past beginner levels should start to require money; past
intermediate levels you should have to find advanced instructors
and do quests for them before they will train you; for master 
level training you would need to do quests to actually discover
"original theories related to your field" to advance.

IE 
I go to the Y to learn the basics of Karate in a free class
taught there.

I discover I like it and in order to go further I find an academy
and pay to train.

I get very good and decide I want to compete at the national 
level - I find a very advanced martial artist and train with him
with at most 2 or 3 other people.

Finally I am one of the premier martial artists in the nation
(yeah, right.  I can almost walk down the street without falling
down.)  No one can teach me more, in order to learn more I have
to apply myself to developing new techniques.

If, at any time you decide that skill was a waste you can recover
your points and spend them in another skill.  Doing so should
drop your "faction" with the high level instructors you learned
the skill from just enough that they won't immediately retrain
you.  This would prevent simply skipping from skill to skill and
back at a whim.  The roleplay explanation is that they were 
offended that you abandoned their teachings :)

Realistically you could sample any skill up through the beginner
levels for free, or the intermediate levels with just a bit of currency.

Skills should be grouped by type (IE arcane skills for what we
now call "int caster" spells).  Taking any level in one category
of skills might make taking levels in another more expensive,
or not possible.  IE - within the Arcane skills we might have
Pyromancy (fire nukes, fire DS's, fire resists, Fire Elementals
etc) - taking levels in that would prevent you from taking
any levels in Aquamancy (the Water mages won't even talk to
you, the elements being opposed) and make Priest skills cost
double their usual cost (because arcane casters deal in logic
and the priests in faith - perhaps).

So the hierarchy is Skill (Pyromancy), Circle (Elements),
Category (Arcane)

Then, instead of character level make spells available by skill
level in the appropriate skill.

Items can then be given recomended skill levels (and are less
useful if you have a lower skill and potentially dangerous if your
skill is too much lower).  

Since you can recover all your points at any time, and immediately
get through the beginner/intermediate levels of a skill (given that you 
have the cash) you can redirect your character more easily than currently.

2 - On gear.  I'd add several new stats to gear.  

Such as:
+/- Skill/Skill circle/Skill category.  Sure you can equip that
super high AC BP, but it has -25 to all arcane skills.  Put a couple
more pieces on like that and you're not casting anything

Or that person with the rogue like skills can equips a full suit
of plate - but all their stealth skills go in the toilet when they
do.

+/- Mana recovery (the item might prevent you from having the mana
flow through you).

To prevent constant swapping of gear make the effects of certain
stats linger -

So, if I equip a BP with -25 to Arcane, then swap in a robe with
-0 to arcane - my total skill is still calculated as though I had
-25 to arcane in that slot.  Over time have that slowly decay 
until it equals the current value in the slot.



There are probably major holes in this (I expect Lance to apply his
hammer liberally) but they are things that have occurred to me to
allow people to direct their characters progress, but within constraints
imposed by the designers (I actually think that's a good thing) and
to redirect their progress with just a few hours work.
