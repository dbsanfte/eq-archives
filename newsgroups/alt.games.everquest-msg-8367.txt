Sometimes when players fight a mob in the pit in Field of Bone, if the
mob runs into the wall, it will then turn invisible and keep attacking
the player while the player can't see where it is to hit it (and of
course it does no good to run to the guards because the guards can't
see it either to hit it).  Unless you're a caster and can cast a spell
on it, the only way to escape is to zone.

Well today, I thought I would try sitting up on the wall (the side of
the wall inside the pit) to med, as I see other players do often.
Well, as I start going up the wall, I turn and I see what looks like
some other weird place (I can see the sky and some trees and grass)
and there in the middle is a big lake or a big hole!  I immediately
turned around and was back in the pit again, fortunately, and I
immediately got back to the ground again.  However, I have heard about
some players who get stuck in that "under the world" place through the
wall and they can't get back out without a GM helping them.  

So anyway, if you're in fighting in FOB, be careful of the wall
surrounding the pit, and don't sit up on the sides to med/rest or you
might wind up under the world!
