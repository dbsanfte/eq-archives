ping.

sure there is . No spells memmed , dammaged , stunned , rooted etc , and
goes ld can pretty much guarantee it was a pulled the plug.

Not dammaged , full set of spells ready , fm , wearing 14 buffs , mob snared
and rooted, and ld is pretty much a clear indication that death as a result
is WAY over the damn top . And dont tell me they cant check it is maybe 4 if
then statements.

They are just too damn lazy to write the 4 statements and as a result hugely
piss off large number of casters in a routine manner.
