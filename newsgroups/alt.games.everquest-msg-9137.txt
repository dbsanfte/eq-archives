Yea I'm a lvl 31 Ogre Warrior and have camped the
room quite a bit since 25.  I could tell that our
group wouldn't stand a chance.  I hated to see
them make such as dumb move but it almost serves
them right.  I had the door in mind as soon as
they pulled.  I just feel for the two guys up top
who go trained.

I did get in a good group last night in the
Warrior Room and we rocked.  I picked up a yellow
and a half in a little over an hour and not once
did anyone come close to dying.  We were pulling
the raider room too and had a good time doing it.
It was one of the better groups I've been in.
