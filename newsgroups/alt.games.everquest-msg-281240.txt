It's actually sort of interesting from a theoretical viewpoint,
as in, people who build computer models of disease propagation
probably find it fascinating, even though some aspects of the
WoW "disease" transmission aren't realistic.  (In particular,
it's far too deadly a disease; in real life not enough carriers
would survive long enough for it to spread.)

What I find most amusing, though, is that this isn't the first
time it's happened.  Apparently there's a design decision in
WoW that you can't remove detrimental spells from a pet by
dismissing it and summoning it back.  (Though I'm told that the
WoW version of pets take a while to summon and have long enough
reuse timers that you wouldn't always want to do that anyway.)
A while back, I heard of a similar situation in WoW, involving
a mob that cast a spell on pets that would, after a short time,
cause the pets to explode, doing enormous AE damage.  Somebody
had the clever idea to dismiss the affected pet, then went to
the auction house in one of the main cities and summoned it
back....
