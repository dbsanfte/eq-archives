4 bags full of junk follows me around everywhere I go - most of which
isn't worth leaving in the bank because the day you need it you know
damn well you won't have it

Depends a lot. Been up to 350k, and down to 30k in the last 6 months.
Currently somewhere in between. Buying Blue Diamonds by the stack
doesn't help heh. I'm also a tradeskill junky too, so that sinks a lot
of cash, especially now I'm on to post-wu's tailoring.

> what level you are, 

L60

Ogre Warrior
