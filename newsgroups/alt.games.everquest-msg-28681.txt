Surely it must be pretty obvious when a character has had their factions
reset?

I mean, Verant must know what the original faction settings are, and it's
quite amazingly unlikely you could have got to any decent level without
impacting some factions significantly. If you're sitting there at L30 or
whatever and all your factions are exactly what they started out at as L1,
something is obviously wrong...
