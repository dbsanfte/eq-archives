I'm paying $9/month for 2 GB of disk space, 30 GB of bandwidth/month,
unlimited subdomains, unlimited email accounts, bulletin boards, chat, CGI,
MySQL (as many databases as I want), and more.  In fact, I seem to have
everything on your "Platinum Plus" plan, except all those places you have
numbers mine is unlimited (except ssh access was a one-time $20 fee for me),
and your Platinum Plus plan is $35 month!

Oh, and the company I use doesn't spam, and so my site isn't going to get
blacklisted off the internet like the sites of anyone dumb enough to use
platinum-host.net for their hosting will be.

In fact, where I'm hosted, for the price of your "Platinum Plus" plan, I
could get a reseller plan with 7 GB of disk space and 60 GB of monthly
transfer, in addition to space and bandwidth for my site, and then offer my
plans to anyone who needs a place to go after they get blacklisted at your
place, and my plans would be better than yours and cheaper...and it would
only take me about an hour to get set up to do this.  That shows how much
your plans suck.
