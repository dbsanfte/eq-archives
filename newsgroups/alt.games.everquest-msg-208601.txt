	OK, so I wander into crushbone to smite some orcs, and end up
near the slave pits.  AFAIK there's never anything much here, just, well,
slaves, and slavers, which were my intended targets.  So I get there and
there's like 6 or 8 people sitting around just outside detection range of the
orcs.  I go over and kill one, but the _players_ get madder than the orc
did!  "It's camped!!! Get lost!!!"

	I argued a bit, along the lines of "My 12 bucks is just as good as
yours and _you're_ not killing them" but decided not to buck an (unwritten
rule?  bullshit group more? whatever) so I left.

	What's the deal on camping?  I understand waiting for a rare
monster but hording ordinary old green orcs?
