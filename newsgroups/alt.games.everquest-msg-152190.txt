I don't <have> to do anything.  Sometimes I <choose> to express my
opinions in particularly blunt terms.  When these opinions are in
direct conflict with what I consider to be an exceptionally stupid
assertion by somebody in this newsgroup it may well appear that I
am insulting the person I am replying to.  That appearance is in
conformance with the underlying reality, at the time I composed and
send the post it was an accurate reflection of my opinion of the
post/poster I replied to.  You don't like it?  You don't have to read
it.

You are suggesting that this newsgroup (not to mention usenet in

general) is not a place where childishness is usually found?  I beg
to differ.  Do me a favor and add me to your killfile, thus sparing
my any more of your sanctimonious insults (Pot?  pleased ta meetcha,
I'm Kettle) in reply to my posts.
