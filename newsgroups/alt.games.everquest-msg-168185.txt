That's how it went for me in LOIO.  My "sufficiently patient masochist"
comment had to do with moving "up" to OT, where in my experience the
mobs are enough tougher that the 55-60% health I could get by bandaging
with HP gear off (rings/earrings/SSB) and then putting HP gear back on
would not be enough to be confident of victory.

My Warrior could only cope with an add if both were low blue, and
even then he might die if the add came early in the fight.  As for
weapons, I had some ok one-handers I used for skill-ups (similar
in quality to the Ebon Razor), but when the going got tough the
only way to win was to switch to a two-hander and start dishing
out more substantial damage.
