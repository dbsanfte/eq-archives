Mark's right. You *may* get a <slightly> higher average of silks per
kill off the EK craig spiders, but you have to travel a lot further to
find them. Timewise, you'll make more kills in Guk's heart spider rooms,
and they are, pound for pound, the best silk farm in the game that I've
ever found. And believe me, I've had to hunt a LOT of silk for various
characters of my wife's. (Big into tailoring). I've tracked on paper, in
an admittedly anal retentive fasion, the amount of silk dropped from
spiders of various species across Norrath. Hands down the best are the
Heart Spiders in UGuk. The worst are the wisp island spiders.
