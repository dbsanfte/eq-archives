    Fear kiting was good from mid 40's to early 50's and apparently is
doable through late 50's and even 60's in PoD. With the new group bonuses
though, grouping would almost always be faster. Pre new group bonuses I
found soloing 45ish-52 to be faster than grouping.

    SK solo dps is a sneaky one. You have to add slash to dots and the pet
is not at all irrelevant, and then factor in zero downtime - you can be
swinging almost constantly. Probably the cool thing about SK soloing is that
you've got tanking and FD to fall back on should things go pear shaped -
meaning you can experiment *a lot* before a silly idea gets you killed ;)

    As for agro management I'll take the pepsi challenge on any paladin you
want to name ;) But seriously, if you've got agro problems in a group with
an SK MA and/or puller, you've got an SK who needs to go and read up on his
spells. I have no problems holding agro off of rogues, wizards, shammies,
you name it. Hell I have more problems convincing pickup shammies and
chanters that it's OK to slow on incoming.

    Helps if the shammy warns me when he's about to dot though - you tend to
only want to spend enough mana to hold agro in normal circumstances - when
people start going ape on the dots we sometimes need to add some more agro.
Not that losing agro for 2 seconds is much of a disaster on a perma-snared
mob.

Cheers,
James
