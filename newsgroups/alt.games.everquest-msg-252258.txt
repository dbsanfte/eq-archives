You mean, they did, I take it.

That's not the strategy MS used with operating systems. The only OS
they ever bought was the original DOS back in 1981. Not only did they
develop all versions of Windows internally, they also wrote OS/2 for
IBM. Don't believe everything Microsoft's enemies claim. Most of it is
bullshit.

Which is what everyone else has been trying to do, but failing at. In
10 years, Vivendi and every other media company will be filing suit
against MS for driving them, out of the gaming industry, when in fact
it was their own stupidity that killed them, not Microsoft's sound
decion making. Isn't that just what happened with productivity
software? I'll go ahead and answer that, since I have no intention of
arguing it again. Yes, that is what happened. Wordperfect and Lotus
dominated the woprd processor and spreadsheet markets when DOS more
popular than windows. Then, the market changed... everyone was using
windows and not using DOS apps. Excel and Word are windows apps.
Wordperfect and Lotus had no windows versions of their applications.
They died.

Microsoft's fault :D

Yes, that is exactly what MS does with games. I agree. And it works,
because that's what everyone else does too... only not as well.
However, IBM tries to do it with business and productivity software.
Not only that, they buy up products that have *already* failed in the
market place, and re-enter them in the race against the same Microsft
applications that already beat em. That's stupidity. UNIX has been
around since 1972. It will never be a popular desktop OS - if that was
going to happen, it would have a LONG time ago. It does do well on
servers - but so what? MS has never been dominant on servers and
probably never will be. That's not what made MS a giant. 

No, what the computer industry needs is some bright young people with
some innovative new ideas and a lot of drive and motivation behind
them. That's what will take MS down. That's how MS took IBM down.

I'm looking forward to it. The computer industry has gotten pretty
stagnant.
