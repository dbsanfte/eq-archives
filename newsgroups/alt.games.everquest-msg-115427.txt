Oh, not on Zeb...Shissar seems to be the stumbling block.  At least in Hate
you don't need to raid it, you just need to FARM it.  But in Fear?  You
gotta pray she's up (and pray CT is down, I THINK...I've only done the two
once each...never together) then gotta pray uberguild_02 doesn't find out
about it before you kill her.
