I've been an Iksar Necro for quite some time, and am still only level
22. I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong. I tend to solo, because when I
group with people I don't know in RL, I end up getting killed, but
every now and then I brave a group, and sometimes I live.

Are there any particularly good things to solo? OT is mostly either
too low or too high for me now. LOIO is good, but often dangerous.

My  other problem is mana. My mana runs out insanely fast,, both when
I use DoTs and when I fear-kite. I've bought as much +INT stuff as I
can afford, and it helps. However, if anyone can give further
pointers, I'd love it! Thanks.
