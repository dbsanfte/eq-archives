HEH!!! I had to learn that one the hard way my self. Was out in Stonebrunt
happily harmony pulling a camp of kobolds. I get my most recent victim down
to death march status, and go up to whack on him. I swing and get a "Loading
Please wait" message!! I Scroll up after zoning back in and see that the
kobold had riposted and killed me! I had apparently lost  alot of health
"kiting" this mob ( I was still learning the whol concept of kiting at that
time and still got beat on a lot ), and the riposte was enough to finish me
off.
