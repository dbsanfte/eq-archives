They were out of stock for awhile because Blizzard did not want to release
anymore copies due to server problems.  They underestimated the popularity
of the game which caused the servers to be unstable.  They had to double
their servers the first few days to accomodate the population.  From 44
servers to 88 I believe.  So there were misc. things that needed to be fix.

Yes, it was in demand. =D
