The point is, they are dependant on the reagents. Necromancers don't
even need those.

...ah, but aren't the focus items "gear"? ;-)

I'm ignoring food and drink requirements on the "gear dependancy"
because everyone needs those, period. Whether you can summon it,
forage it, or buy it, it's needed. The question was least GEAR
dependant, not most independant. Those neat bags, weapons, and focus
items you summon are gear, even if you're summoning them yourself...

Even overlooking reagent needs and judging gear dependancy on simply
all equipment slots being empty, I'd place necromancers higher.
