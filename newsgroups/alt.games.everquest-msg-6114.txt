One of my USENET posting spamtraps had a sudden drastic drop in spam
recently. I had begun to wonder if perhaps the spammers had learned.
It seems not. The service (Excite) added DUL and RBL filtering, and
dropped the results into a seperate folder. I found this out when I
logged in to clean it out, got the mailbox full warning, but only had
6 messages. I begin poking around and find a folder called Junk Mail
that had 3.6Mb in it. Sheesh! got a lot of investigating and LARTS to
send. And now I gotta verify if the dropboxes and dialups are still
active, if I can. Time to load .sightings for correlations.... <sigh>
