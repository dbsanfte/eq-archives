You're right, when Kurik comes back from his underway, I'll tell him I don't
need his help on the Plaguebone thiefs, since he obviously sucks.  Never
mind the fact that we were able to clear the hut with us duoing, when I may
be able to keep a single spawn clear by myself.  Sucks, though, since my xp
is going to drop significantly from what we were doing... but if you say so,
it must be true.
