Gee, did you go to school on the short bus?  Probably, if you think that
anybody would post here *before* checking server status... Oh, wait, I'm
sorry! *YOU* posted before checking server status.  Gee, seems soooo simple
to do that before shooting away like the dunce you are:

http://everquest.station.sony.com/ had *ALL* servers up before I tried to
log and finally posted...
In fact, http://everquest.station.sony.com/ had *ALL* servers up when you
posted... Furthermore, http://everquest.station.sony.com/ has *ALL* servers
up as I write this!

Oh, and by the way, O Simple One, I tried what the previous poster (Thank
you, Jim Monk, wherever you are!) had suggested and successfully logged on.

Next time, may I suggest that you keep you simpleton ramblings to yourself,
please, even if we know you just can't help yourself?

Thus refraining yourself from opening mouth and inserting foot would
probably prevent most people here from thinking "Gee, Greg seems simple..."

Alas, in your case it's much too late for that.

Hope you get a window seat on that short bus!
