Well it was funny, last night some level 1 Iksar shaman comes on
/shouting about how their higher level shaman had given the new
character some stuff (think was some plat, their Shestar coif, a
morning star and a totem something or other, I forget) and that they
camped and then when they logged on again just now, all the stuff had
disappeared; then they went on about how they just /petitioned now and
were waiting and in the meantime could somebody give them a weapon or
money to buy a weapon?  This person kept whining and whining and
people finally started telling him/her "well, then, you shouldn't
twink your characters till they get to level 6" and this player
actually says, "What is twinking?"  They then kept whining some more
about how long would it take for a GM to answer and would they still
be able to speak to the GM if they logged off and then came back
later, and still begging for a weapon/money; then they finally must
have logged after a while.  

Often when people start /ooc'ing or /shouting about "anybody got
something for a newbie?", I'll /ooc "Yeah, I can give you some
advice--don't beg".
