Oddly enough, nobody seems to have realized what you were doing here.   Even
though (I thought) it was well done.

"42" was demonstrating that if you have people using both top posting and
bottom posting at the same time, even if it is just a sample 2 person
conversation, the entire thread quickly becomes  near unreadable.   Thats
before adding in the usual features of usenet, 3'rd parties jumping in and
posters editing what they're quoting.

Scroll up, scroll down, try to count the number of indents... oh, no that
wasn't in response to 3, it was to 4...
