Add to the fact that sometimes a heal will give no aggro (or at least used
to maybe this has changed).

The main tank (the guy being beat on), will generally have means to build up
a greater amount of aggro via spells / disciplines and weapon procs (effects
such as direct damage stuns, enraging blow etc, that increases the aggro by
a fair margin).

You will generally only get aggro through spam healing (fast heals) people.

Situations vary though :)
