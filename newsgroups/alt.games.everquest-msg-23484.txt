To the best of my knowlege Melee classes Rogues are the true Masters of
Damage output followed by Monks next I would place Warriors, Shadow Knights,
Rangers and Paladins. I am baseing this on everyone having roughly the same
amount to spend (2 - 5k) on weapondry and being the same level. General
overall ability to Tank in a small single Tank Group Warrior wins out with a
tie going to Shadow Knight and the Monk.
