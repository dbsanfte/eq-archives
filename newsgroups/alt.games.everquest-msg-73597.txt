Myself and 2 of my friends at work created a 3 person team for going
through life.  We did it a bit different though.  They are
completely new to EQ and I have been around for well over a year
(maybe over 2 now hmmm...).  We all wanted to start in the same town
so we made Fatties. 2 Ogre warriors and an Ogre Shaman. While this
group is not "complete" really we can likely go all the way to 50
with no trouble at all.  We always get people to join when we want
them by just telling people what we have and looking for more in
ooc.  Also Trading SoW for crack gets a response more often than not
if any chanters in the zone.

We could have made an SK warrior shammie thing but the massive HP of
the Warrior won out.  When I (main assist) get a bit beaten up I
just stop hitting and step back and my friend she gets to lose some
of her 1300 HP (or about there now)  =).

All that said I would go with a Shaman out of the choices you
supply.
