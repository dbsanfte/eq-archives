I wasn't sure what to think about Steam at first, it honestly didn't seem 
like too much of a hassle, but after some thought and learning a bit about 
it, I have to say that I completely agree with you. Put any kind of anti-
piracy measures you want on the CD itself. That's completely appropriate. I 
don't play pirated games. However, making me jump through hoops and 
tolerate the trickle download system presently employed just smacks of 
greed. 

Worse is the crap they feed us about the reasons behind it. Few reasons 
they have for implementing Steam actually benefit the consumer. Beyond 
keeping their game patched (hey, I have an idea, how about making the game 
require fewer patches so that's not such an issue?), it is pretty much 
merely a means of improving their profit margin.

To top it all off, as I understand it, if you decide the game just isn't 
for you, you have to pay an additional $10 to un-register the CD key before 
you can sell or give the game to someone else. What's more, you have to 
send in the CD jewel case cover which prevents this sort of transaction 
from happening more than once. 

I am honestly left wondering who they think they are, Microsoft? Sorry, 
they ain't all that. I've been forced to come to terms with the fact that 
I'm Microsoft's b**ch, but I have no reason to tolerate tactics like Steam 
in my PC games. Valve just ain't all that.
