I'll have to agree with Ben on this one.  Exp'ing in Sebilis while
getting spells for some new guildees, both our monk "tank"
and me could handle Juggs without much trouble (I said "much,"
not "none").  A warrior just wasn't needed, as Counterattack/Nimble
could help me off-tank just fine for the extra few rounds needed to
help split the adds.

The warrior is needed when you MUST let a main tank build aggro
before the big CH chain starts in to work.  Even with some of
the best HP buffs in the game, I end up with around 6400 hps.  That's
just not enough to last through even General V'Ghera chewing
on me as a MT, and if a CH chain had to work on me they'd have
to start early enough  that the first CH landed would equal getting
a ping-pong.  Counterattack would seem to work, but it just doesn't
last long enough to build up aggro, even with whirlystab going.

Give a monk or rogue or paly Defensive (or even just a longer
timer on CA-type disciplines), and a warrior might not even be
needed unless you were short on clerics/mod rods/necros.

The first time Bloodbath dropped in ST, Warriors dropped
even further behind rogues in doing damage.  A lot.  Not that
I'm complaining, because that's not his job and it IS mine,
but it still had an effect on the game mechanics.  And that's
not including the even better weapons that drops there, whether
you want to avoid getting aggro (TS) or just go all out and
carve everything up and trust in Evade (Khalshazar, or as my
friend said when he saw me soloing in Guk to help a friend's
bard get his mask, KhalHOLYSHIT!!!).
