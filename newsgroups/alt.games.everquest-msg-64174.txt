Since I figure the patch message will be posted at least three times
by the time I post tonight, I won't bother with a complete rehash :)

Jakugg, do you have an official statement on this? : )

Cute. Maybe one day in the future, if I stop hating the new graphics
and have a faster computer, I'll try this. I just wonder how many
times you get to use this command?

Yay!!

Second (slightly smaller) yay!

So, my SK will still see her 11-pt lifetap... but still nice.

"*mutter* In my day, we had to climb uphill through the snow to get
our teeth, and now young'uns can just be ported to Cobalt Scar at
level 1!" Okay change, I guess - no more passengers left behind
because they've accidentally banked/destroyed/forgotten to get their
teeth, and no scary Kael runs for my alts.

/cheer

Now THIS will come in handy for GM events!

Interesting. Wonder if existing items will have this, or if it'll all
be Luclin items?

Now this is something I hope they'll only do with the new graphics, as
it'll ruin the coolness factor of my gnomeskin tunic to have it turned
from a black t-shirt to a set of black straps (gnome skin has old
world leather patterning, not Velious patterning) :)

Hmm. Dark elf with red hair and black beard? (concerned - and I never
liked the extended coloration of dark elves anyway. High elves with
black hair sounds wrong too)
