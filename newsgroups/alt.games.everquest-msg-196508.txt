I totally agree but majority of players don't seem to want an immersive RPG.
They want hack and slash and phat lewt. They their guilds name mentioned
alongside Afterlife and FoH. They want Quake with Swords.../grumble

Don't mind me, I spent the last couple of nights on FV only to leave the
newbie confines of FP and it's surrounding zones (via PoK) to find that it's
not really any different, in attitude, from Bristlebane :ï¿½/ oh well...At
least so far I have yet to see Legolas names or characters named after WWE
Wrestlers.

CF
Still, I think I see why so many players come to Bristlebane from other
servers, compared to FV prices it's well worth the swap...Sheesh how's a
Newbie warrior meant to by his suit of Crafted when you are still asking '99
prices?
