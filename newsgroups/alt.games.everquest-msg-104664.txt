Wow.  I don't think I've ever been rebuked with such a soft touch,
ouch.  :)

OK, now this does sound familiar.  I remember reading something about
it hear, most likely from you.  I know I haven't seen anything about
it, or at least not obvious enough for me to understand, on any of the
bard boards.  
Damn, now it's obvious, but I've never seen it explained before.  How
well known was this, and how widespread was the abuse?

OK, this I didn't realize.  I was under the impression that they were
trying to fix the Katta's Sword Dancing bug, but now that you mention
it, the recent break does seem a lot more like they were trying to fix
a global setting, like coding bardsongs as spells instead of <other>.
Personally, I would just wish that Verant would do a complete re-write
of Katta's and get it working so all the (whiny druids)* playing
mid-level bard twinks will quite whining about it on the boards!

Arolpin
* ob druid slander, but the damn petition got like 1300+ posts
already, no wonder you're all over our boards too.
