I have Obulus death shroud and Amulet of insight for Focus
3,no room for Mantle of Gunthak,and I like some stats on
my equipment.
Was thinking of purchasing Ceramic Totem of Rathe for Improved
Healing,but decided money is better spent on 2 ornate bracers,
cause mana preservation does something for Cheal too,while
IH4 is worthless concerning Cheals.

Under ideal circumstances true,but usually the mob does not
stand at the same spot for the whole fight,because casters
get aggro most of the fights.
Only real use I have from hammer is duoing with a SK friend
from my regular group,then its easy to make sure hammer
attacks from behind.

Of course I made sure,when I dinged 30,that Specialize
Alteration was the first skill to pass 50.
I was talking about the normal skills.

Have an Enchanter in my regular group,if we wanted we could
reduce mob damage output to zero. :)
But now there is a gap in stun spells,since most mobs we fight
are around 56 to 60,and even when I get new stun spells there
will be only 2 which work on mobs higher than 55,weird that my
abilities will be worse at higher level than now.

I fully agree,still love Kael Arena,and helping friends with
Epic is fun,even if it means farming greenies outside CT
for useless SK epic,as I am doing just right now.  :)
