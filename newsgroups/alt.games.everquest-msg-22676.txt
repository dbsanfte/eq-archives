I know that fresh fish and highland pike will make fish fillets 
(or highland pike fillets i believe.). However, highland
pike can't be used for fish rolls. So if your fish aren't "fresh fish" find another
fishing spot or buy some test fish from vendors. You need one fresh fish and one
jug of sauces, and you'll get two fillets if you succeed. Which you won't much
at your skill level.
