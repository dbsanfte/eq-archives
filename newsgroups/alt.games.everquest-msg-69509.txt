Probably not, but we'll try. :-)

In case you already didn't find out, once you've scribed spells in the
book, if you wish to move them, just right click on that spell. The
message you get will tell you to go to a new page or slot and right
click on that spot to movet he spell to there. Just keep your most
commonly used spells up on the first set of pages. You'll adjust later
as you advance and get more spells. You can move the old ones you've
outgrown to the back and keep your most frequent lineup on the first
couple pages for fast memming.

While no tradeskill will turn you a huge profit, particularly at this
level, tailoring is one of the cheaper ones to get into, and could prove
the most beneficial if you are brand new and have nobody to gift better
gear on you. Save up to purchase a sewing kit. A small one will do at
first. Later you can buy a large, ten slot one. If you can't afford one
for now, most all cities have large public Looms that you can use for
free to do your tailoring, providing nobody else is using them already
at that time. The materials you need for sewing can all be obtained from
creatures you will now be starting to hunt at level four. (e.g.
spiderlings, spiders, wolves, cats). Getting spiderling silks, and later
spider silks, and combining them will increase your tailoring skill at
first, plus allow you to make useful things, including raw silk armor,
which is great low level wizard armor. To learn all about tailoring, go
to
http://www.lokari.net/everquest/tailoring.html
This is Lokari's tailoring guide. Read it, bookmark it, and print it out
for ingame reference if possible. It will tell you all you need to know
about tailoring.

Good luck and have fun!
