There's something here that I commonly see in posts on Graffe's
as well.  That is, that people put on LFG and then go off and do
their thing, and wonder why people don't beat a path to their 
door.  When I want a group (and my guild doesn't have one that
needs someone, or enough people to put one together) I go to each
of my favorite XP zones, I put on LFG, I OOC "65 mage looking for
group," then run to each of the camps and ask in say "Anyone here
need a 65 mage?" 

It is this last step that gets me my PU groups.  When a group
is down a member (and not a slower/tank/healer) the person they
are going to remember is the person who actually sought them out.

Looking for a group is an activity, like job searching, that requires
you to actually go out and find the group. 

The attitude of many Graffe's people is "I put on LFG and no one
gives me a tell out of the blue to group, so people don't want 
wizards in their groups."  Of course, the folks (like me) who can't
solo effectively in PoP are getting those spots because we go out
and work for them, not because we are of an inherently better grouping
class.
