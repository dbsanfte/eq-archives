That's a pretty good summation of EQ questing, Don. I would agree with 
your take on it. As far as the idea that SoE has taken steps in WoW's 
direction with the TSS expansion, I have heard/read the same. IMO, it's a 
shame, really. 

I don't think the solution to their problems is to make EQ more like WoW. 
WoW already does WoW better than anyone else can. I've liked both games 
for completely different reasons. Making one more like the other only 
gives me more reason to be *playing* the other. /shrug

Here's to sticking to your guns. /em raises his mug.
