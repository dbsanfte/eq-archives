So do you give anything to the cleric in the same zone who rezzes you
or not?  I don't agree with the actions of the OP, but on the other
hand "thank you" doesn't really cut it.  A port costs 300 mana and I'm
willing to bet you charge for that.  A rez costs 700 mana, plus the
Divine Light I usually throw in which is a further 350.  I'll rez for
KEI, I'll rez for C2, I'll rez for money, but if all you can pony up
is "thank you" I won't say anything, but you've just fallen off my top
10 favorites list.

Whether the rez takes place in the same zone or not is really
immaterial.  What *is* relevant is the incurred downtime for the
cleric's group.

And, tangential but I think still relevant, clerics are *rarely*
compensated for their Symbols other than in Seb.  Typically when I go
back to town to resupply with, say, 400pp, half of that goes to buying
more dots.  I think of rez fees as compensating for that to some
extent.
