We got to 399 last night in the Bazaar on Seventh Hammer.  242 of them were
vendors.  At the same time VI was announcing that they were closing in on
100000 members online at one time.  They were trying to break the barrier,
but they never did announce that they had made it.

Just goes to show that EQ was killed by DAoC and NWN.
