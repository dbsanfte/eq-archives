    Odds are if you've only been playing for a few weeks then any guard
you're able to kill will not be high enough level to give the massive
faction hit required to make you KoS if you aren't already.

    If you're on apprehensive or better don't even worry about it, if you're
on dubious already you might consider handing in a few deathfist belts
first, but probably not necessary.
