My experience has been that either an ability advances the chain, or
it breaks it, unless you've reached the wheel stage, at which point it
won't break but wait for all the required abilities.  I've never been
able to use an ability that doesn't advance a chain without breaking
the cahin, at least not when I've been paying attention.
