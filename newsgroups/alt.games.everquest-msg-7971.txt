A pair of platinum fire opal rings (AC5, +55HP) would be very nice for
you...

Stats in EQ are broken (by design), don't invest in them (save perhaps
stamina, which is worth getting to 100 to eliminate penalties for
running out) .  Look for AC and +HP in your equipment.

Also, what weapon do you use?  If it's fist, for 650PP or so on a good
deal you may be able to get a fighting baton, a very nice upgrade over
a fist.
