Changs the likelihood of resisting and the range I believe. I used to use
Lull sung all the time - was heavy on resists, but would really slow down a
pack of my group got gang tackled. Unfortunately, they nerfed this down to a
targeted lull.

For me, I usually gave up twisting when I did the 27 Charm. If I used it, I
kept it on until I was ready to say "I can handled the mob 3 ticks from
now" - usually in the end game of whatever I was using the charmed mob to
attack. On occasion though, I would charm, send them into battle, twist in
two other songs, switch target back and recharm - wash, rinse, repeat. TONs
of work though, and can be a real hassle if you haven't figured out using
the tab key for target memory (you can wind up with so many targets around
that it's tough to target the one you want and be sure of it.
