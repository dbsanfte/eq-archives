Thanks to all for the info, guess I'll just have to check prices and
see.  The horse-head thing still makes me wonder, because the guy who
told me it is not a problem for him is a Barbarian warrior so I know
he's not shrinking himself.  Plus now I've bben reading that different
lizards give different bonuses, like improved STA, decreased aggro
range, etc... based on color.  This just keeps getting more
complicated... hehe
