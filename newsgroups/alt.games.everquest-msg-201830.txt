I have AoW pants, (and didn't go for Aten pants because of them) but I have
np handing them back, when I get my elemental.

If I was looking to buy a pair though, even knowing the benefits of one over
the other, I'd still have no qualms going for Stonehide - heck I could even
use the saved money to buy a nice upgrade elsewhere, for an even bigger
HP/Regen/Stats difference.

My first real tunic (ie upgrade from fungi) was 40AC (ancient wyvern-hide),
back in Velious times. When the time came tho, I had no problems upgrading
to a 23ac/100hp/haste tunic (since wearing a 33/120, but purely down to that
second stat)

This is from the perspective of a "monk tank"
