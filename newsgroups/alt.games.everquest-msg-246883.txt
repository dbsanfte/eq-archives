No!  Just someone who has some freakin' time!!!

Sorry, you just touched on a sore spot for me.  =)  I've asked five separate
artists to do a commission for me, all five of which had web pages that said
they were accepting commissions.  Two turned me down flat, saying they were
overburdened, one hasn't responded at all, one accepted the commsion but
mentioned a big backlog, one said he had a big backlog and would get back to
me when he had the time.

That was a month ago.  Four weeks later and here I sit, willing to spend
lots of money on a character portrait, and I have nothing to show for it.
People must not want my money.  =(

Yes, yes, I understand, it's their life, they have other obligations like
school and work.  Yes, they are under no obligation to accept my money.  But
dangit, why even advertise that you are accepting commissions if you're in
no position to act on them?  You just end up setting expectations you can't
meet.  And that's not good for you or your customers.

Argh and double-argh.

Anyway, to actually answer your question: trust is a big part of the
business.  Many artists require verified payment up front before even
starting on a commission, and I have no problem with that.  No matter what
kind of payment you require - PayPal, check, Western Union, whatever - I
understand that you want to have money in hand before beginning work on
laying out the portrait and coloring it, etc.

Yes, you could take the money and run, but word would spread fairly quickly.
Quite frankly, if I'm someone who gets upset because you require money up
front, I'm probably someone who was either thinking of not paying in the
first place or couldn't afford it at all.

Paying with credit cards is awfully convenient, but I also understand that
many artists are the starving kind, and may not have the financial
wherewithall to open up a PayPal service, so I wouldn't mind alternate forms
of payment.
