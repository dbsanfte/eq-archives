I agree with that.  

If you are selling something, decide how much you are selling it for, or 
say up front you are taking offers.  Vast majority of the time, when 
someone says "Selling Heiro Cloak" they know damn well how much it would 
normally go for, they just want to see if I will offer more than that.

My reaction to asking for an offer?  Offer low.

You want to get an insanely high price for your item?  Ok, I want an 
insanely low one.  

Seller: Make offer

me: Umm... ok, 1k.

Seller: LOL, that's too low

me: well you obviously have some idea of what you want, why not just tell 
me what you want to sell it for.

Seller: nm

me: what, not even a counter offer?

Seller: offer more

me: um, no, I'll buy from someone who won't waste my time with this stupid 
cat and mouse game of "keep naming more money until you arrive at the 
price that I already know in my head I want"

/ignore Seller
