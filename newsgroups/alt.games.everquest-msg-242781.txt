Extended Enhancement makes buffs last 15% longer all the time.  Improved
Damage, Burning Affliction, Improved Healing are a random 1-20% more.  Mana
Preservation is 10% all the time.  Reagent Conservation is a 15% chance not
to use a reagent.

There are still focus effects to make dots lasts longer.  Extended Torment
and Focus of Mediocrity are the two that come to mind.
