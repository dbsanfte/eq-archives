In my experience as a lvl 60 enchanter. cha above 150 doesn't seem to affect
charming a mob. Seems to be lvl and magic resistance of the mob and level of
chanter. Either charms last the full duration or the usual few seconds or
so.

Mez on other hand does seem to be affected by cha from experience. My usual
kit gives me 170cha unbuffed and I do get less resists buffed (220cha) than
unbuffed
