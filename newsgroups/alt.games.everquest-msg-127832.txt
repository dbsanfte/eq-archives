For what it's worth, I once was going to write something similar.  The plan
was that you would share your EQ folder, and then on another computer, the
mapper would watch the log file, looking for zone messages and /loc output,
and would display where you were.  I was thinking of even going a little
farther, and watching for other messages.  E.g., if you con something, pull
any data on that kind of mob up (level range, drops, faction, etc).  I
wasn't going to use vector maps, but rather GIF or JPEG files that you'd
download from whatever your favorite mapsite was.  You'd get a map from,
say, EQMaps, and name it appropriately so my program could find it.  The
first time it used a map, I was planning on making you pick two points on
the map and enter their coordinates, so the program could figure out the
orientation and scale.

Anyway, I sent a message to Verant explaining what I planned to do, and
telling them that while I didn't think it violated the EULA, if they had any
objection to it, just tell me, and I would cancel the project.

They never responded.

ps: I never did get time to write the thing.  Things got crazy at work for a
while, leaving me in no mood to come home and program.
