The idea isn't to go in with less than full health or mana (unless you're a 
necro), but rather to work it so that both top off at the same time.  Any 
time you're full on one and waiting for the other to fill up, you're 
effectively regenning at half power (more or less, since the regen rates are 
rarely a 50/50 split) and wasting some fraction of a regen tick.
