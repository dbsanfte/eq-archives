I played Shadowbane yesterday, and thought it rocked. The first MMORPG I
have ever played without any technical difficulty at all the first day. The
game itself was a lot of fun to play and I noticed that one thing you might
try doing is to not read the spoilers about the game and just play it, that
will increase your enjoyment immensely to always have new things to explore
and even your new spells you get are a surprise.

Is this my first on topic post? alright!
