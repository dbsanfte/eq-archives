The new Unrest instance is a lot of fun, and the rare drop at the end is a 65
hp/mana/endurance augment. Plenty of undead for the cleric and pally to play
with.

Someone mentioned Nurga, but I think it's a bit too low for your levels. Droga
would be good if you bring someone who can snare.

If you all have Howling Stones keys then you could all work on getting the Hand
of Glory, which is the master key to the inside doors.
