You say DEPENDABLE like I am not?
Just cause I have job and I am not some school kid off for the summer
and can't play 24/7, that makes me undependable?

I am not saying I have any answers or that there are any easy answers.

I have been on OPEN  raids where they didn't do full randoms, raider
dictated who got what. That is fine if he is fair, but most of the
time he favors guild members or  friends.

My guild isn't large enough to go on high end  raids, so I don't get
involved with raids that do use DKP system.. that post didn't
particularly refer to me but raids in  general.
Besides, regardless of what I said  in paragraph below.. I go on raids
with guild as something fun to do and if I get some kind of loot..
well thats cool but I don't expect it.

Someone mentioned that you do raids for fun not the loot.. but that
isn't really true. Most guilds do the high end raids to increase their
effectiveness as a guild by attaining that UBER equipment.


In my perspective... what it boils down to me, is if I go on a high
end raid, with whatever class I plan to use... I  helped to take down
that UBER mob as much as anyone else in the raid did.
Regardless of how many times some tank did previous raids, I am
talking about THIS current raid.

The way I see it.. if I do a raid  once a week.. then I only get a
shot a loot once a week, whereas the person that does 10 raids a week
gets a shot at loot 10 times more then me?
 
I do think that point system.. where you spend raid points you earned
in extra numbers of rolls for a item is very fair.
IE... I do one raid a week.. I get to to roll ONCE for that item, but
the other person who did 10 raids that week, so he gets to roll 10
times for that same item.
