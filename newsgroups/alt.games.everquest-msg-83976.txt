ooh, I thought I'd just add:

The pre-requisite of having to track down, ship and buy a physical box
for each new account IS un-necessary, I'd agree with you there. I'm sure
it's simply something to do with quotable 'box shirt' figures.

What would be MUCH simpler would have an online 'account key' shot,
where you could buy subsequent account keys only, online at a slightly
reduced cost. The files themselves are big enough to make widespread
DLing ineffective (when you add in the cost/time of DLing, burning a
backup, etc.) as a way of saving a couple of $$$. Remove the '1 month
free' from these key only purchases, drop the price by $10, and I'm sure
you'd shift more accounts (and regular monthly subscriptions) than
forcing people to buy online and pay delivery in most cases
