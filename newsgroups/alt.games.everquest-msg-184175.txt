/agree

I mean how hard is it for the real twinks with equippment for several 1000pp
to just undress and unequip their stuff to look like all the other newbies
in case a welldoer comes along.
I have seen this happend several times when someone /ooc's they are handing
out gifts to newbies (allways seems to happend in GFay for some reason).
And  *Fwwoosh* there are armours being taken off and Wurmys and Centi LS's
being tucked in backpacks faster then you can say "n00b" up on orc hill and
then all the twink lvl 5's, with equipment that would make a lvl 50+ cry,
runs down to orclift to get their hand on a free FS longsword being handed
out by a clueless welldoer.

How Uber...
