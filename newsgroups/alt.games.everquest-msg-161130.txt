Yep, when I'm out and about in PoD with Mr. Snookums (my pet swamp rat)  I'm
rarely below 80% mana.

I do get sit agro though because I don't have the horse visible, but I get
the standing meditation effect.

Horse + mask of the stalker makes the horses head take up like half my
screen because of mask's vision effect (increases field of view by about 10
degrees, giving a "backing up" effect when you cast it, and making even more
of Zippy's neck in my way.)
