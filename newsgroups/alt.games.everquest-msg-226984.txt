With my twinks, I do high difficulty more often than not.  At 65, though,
high difficulty is actually quite hard (unforgiving may be a better word). 
I won't bother with a hard adventure at 65 unless I've got a good cleric
(preferably not my own 2-box, but I have done that as well), a good tank, an
enchanter or bard or *possibly* a shaman.  Without those elements, hard
missions just aren't all that winnable at 65.

That said, I will take groups into hard missions purely to track down the
named and farm them, with no plan of attempting to win at all.  Not so hard
to find people that don't actually care about the leaderboard, though harder
to find people that don't care about points at all.
