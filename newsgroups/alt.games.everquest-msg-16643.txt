Hi,

Just got a new Pentium4 machine with a GeForce2 mx400 64mb video card, but
when I start EQ, the graphics slowly wash out.  It's pretty psychedelic, but
pretty much makes the game unplayable at any resolution of 1024x768 & under.
I have the latest beta drivers, but need to know if anyone else has
experienced this.  Card works fine for everything else I've tried.

System is P4, 128mb rdram, Windows ME, etc. etc...

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Serafino
