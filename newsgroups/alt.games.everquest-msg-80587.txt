    I've found that the server won't always drop someone who is aggro to a
mob. So as long as you can keep them in combat, they stay "active". Happened
to me once when I fired Divine Aura, then /q'ed on a King overpull in
Chardok. I apparently tanked the King and his guards long enough for the
people who were left to escape. :-) (Sometimes, when you DA and /q, the
Divine Aura invulnerability effect stays up until the server drops you.)
