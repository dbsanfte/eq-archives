Um, 255 is not a prime number.

I have never heard your particular theory that 255 is bad for skillups.  I
have heard all sorts of fun things, like having the recipe book increases
your chances of success, or other such nonsense.  It is certainly possible
that 255 is not as good as 254 for skillups, we are talking about Verant
here, but it is more likely that 255 is as good as or better for skillups.

I will continue to strive for 255 until I see convincing evidence that I
should do otherwise, and having someone say that it seems to be slower is
not convincing.  If you have log files, and know what your wisdom was
between skillups, and can document your feelings, then I will consider
striving for something other than 255.
