Once again Bards are broken to the point were they are pretty much
unusable.  What gets me is that as far as I can tell Verant has yet to
aknowledge the problem.  Yes mistakes happen but at least they should
tell us what is going on.  Can you imagine if say the Druid or Wizard
class was broken.  They would have the servers down in no time flat to
fix the problem, why are bards any differnt.  It has now been over 24
hours since the patch and not a peep from them.  I have seen bard
glitches last for over a month before they get around to fixing them.
As for Luclin a majority of the songs don't work.  Yet here they are
doing all these cool things to spells and trying to balance out the
pure casters.  Is it to much to ask that before they do that they fix
the broken songs? They have gone to all this trouble to make life
easier for newbie characters, so why can't they fix the bard bug.
Well, this was just to blow off some steeam, and who knows maybe
somebody from Verant will ready this and let us know when bards are
going to be fixed.....and it better not be days and days and day.  But
then again what can I do if it is....maybe DAoC.  I just have to keep
reminding myself that the grass is greener on the other side and DAoC
must have it's problems too.
