Actually, you said decent, not fairly decent.

I have a vague memory of a book that may have been his.  I think it was 
subtitled "Kingdom for Sale" or maybe it just had that on a sign in front 
of a castle on the cover.

<pause>

Had to look it up.  The title is: "Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold!"  It's 
the first book in the Magic Kingdom of Landover series.  I don't think it 
was very good.  Maybe more like fairly decent...
