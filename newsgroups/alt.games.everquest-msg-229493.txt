warriors have gained an additional 5% mitigation boost over all other
classes. That means they will take 5% less damage, e.g. if a mob hits a
shadowknight for 1000, it would only hit a warrior for 950.

Your new disciplines are not a trainable skill.... after you hand the tome
to your guildmaster, you get the skill, period.  There is no 'skilling up'.

Press ctrl-c and look for the skill in your combat skill window.
