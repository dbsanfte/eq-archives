Quick question to those in the know ... :-)

Are the Shadowed Men in SK worth the trouble of buying Dismiss Summoned and
camping for a newly dinged lvl 24 druid?  My understanding is that a lot of
their loot is no rent, and I have no idea how they are for XP.  Any
direction from SK and/or Druid vets would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Crash
