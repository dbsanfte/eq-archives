All righty then! Time to recount my group's adventures in Guk
this weekend it seems like, hehe. Lots of FLWs there, for some
reason...

First off, at the Ritualist:

Big Dumb Ogre: Oops!
The rest of the group: Hey, where'd BDO go?
BDO: Uh-oh, I fell down!
BDO's health bar plummets real fast as all the lower level
mobs converge on him.

Spent 10 minutes searching for him, found him in frenzy,
where a high-level cleric had rezzed him.

Maybe HALF AN HOUR later:

BDO: Argh! (Or possibly something a bit less printable)
TROTG: What, AGAIN?

This time, we found him near AM, still dead.

A real classic:

Big Dumb Troll (Me, hehe): Mem gate, I'm gonna try something new.
TROTG: Uh-oh, famous last words!
BDT: Nah, we'll be fine, but mem gate just in case.
(I proceed down to the lower level with ITU on, to find
a nice juicy yellow con ghoul to pull)
BDT: Incoming a Yun Ghoul Knight (or something like that)
Two unseen ghoul wizards: Frrrroooaaak!
BDT: GATE!

I made it back to the camp, where their fifth and sixth Inferno
Shocks finished me just in time to see the rest of the group
still waiting for the pull. They managed to kill all three,
though. Gotta love that trollish Fire resist... a 250 dd spell
hit for 260 6 times, yay. (No typo)

A paladin who had been farming AM and ass/sup rezzed me, so not
much exp lost, at least.

Much later:

Me: Hmm, isn't this pretty much on the track from AM, Frenzy
and Lord?
Bard: Naw, trains don't pass through here.
Frenzy camper in /ooc: TRAIN!

We turn from our solitary knight to see a wood elf tearing past
us at speed, followed by all the frogloks between frenzy and
Ritualist. Whee. A damn WALL of frogs... The casters managed to
gate out, and I logged on my cleric to rez the rest, except for
myself, hehe. Luckily another cleric came along and rezzed me.

LGuk is fun!

Lessons learned:
BDO: I'm gonna sit my ass here, and not move an inch!
BDT: Let's stick to blues, and try for singles for preference...
BDT: It's better to set up camp in Gargs than in Ritualist. Never
a good idea to sit on the tracks.

That's something I should've known, too. Been in LGuk lots with
the cleric, sigh...

But we had fun though, I hope... Two of them haven't been online
since, oops...
