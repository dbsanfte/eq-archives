You have obviously never played a monk.

The change ("nerf") lowered a monks ability to "mitigate" damage. This
means that monks took more damage and were hit for max damage more
often after the nerf.

The only monks that could "solo forever" were the ones with the best
equipment (fungi tunics, NTOV, Uber-Raid gear, etc). These monks
(which represent less than 5% of the monks playing EQ) were running
around with AC and HPs well above the soft cap and rivalling plate
classes (WAR/SK/PAL). 

By nerfing mitgation across the board for all monks, they might have
addressed an imbalance at the uber-levels, but they screwed over
everyone else. Imagine what it would be like if they cut all Wizard's
mana pools by 25% from levels 1-65, because the top 5% of Wizards were
doing too much damage when equiped with +mana items and Flowing
Thought gear. Who would it hurt more? The level 65 Wizard or the level
25?

The problem is that the nerf didn't hurt the "uber-monks" nearly as
much as it hurt the average monk. SOE finally realized this and are
attempting to correct the issue with this latest patch.
