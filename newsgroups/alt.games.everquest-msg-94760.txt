I hate people who go to sleep with their pet farming exp in a safe manner
while they snooze.

Last night one of these idiots got me killed. yay.  On the bright side, I
think his rez timer wore off before he wakes up.

It's hard to grab a quad up around a pet killing static spawns, especially
when you get stunned, and due to the maximum to how many things can beat on
you at once, one goes off to kill the mage pet (fire), and since doing
partial quads is not efficient unless you're just seeing if you're capable
of doing it in the area, I try to gate (with 3 things beating on me), and
die. (since you can't outrun unsnared things underwater even with sow I
couldn't even try to run.)  Bound about 100 feet away so I get to watch the
carnage as his pet succumbs to 3 or 4 goblins.

Total score:
Mage pet: 1 (before he went down)
Mage (who had been afk for at least 3 hours): -1 (died)
anonymous dorf sitting next to the mage (also afk for at least 3 hours): -1
(died)
Bloodgill Goblins: 1 mage pet, 1 mage, 1 druid, 1 dorf - total: 4

At least I got to kill the goblin with a harpoon of the depths later...
