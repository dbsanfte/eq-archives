Thanks for the link Bob. But what voodoo is required to post on these
forums? I am trying to post on the General Discussion forum but I cannot for
the life of me get the "New Message" icon to un-grey. I went so far as to
create a new account (even though I had one) then I signed up for the goofy
fan-club, and finally I altered my profile thinking I could shake some board
cookies around. I am shown as being logged in and everything is a go except
for the fact that I can't post. Arg.

Could the boards be beta testers only right now?

Thanks,
Sampan
