my friend says he is starting a magic user guild and he asked if i wanted to
join.  i told him that i would be happy to fight with his guild and do
guild-related things with them, but that i didn't really want to be a part
of a guild because, as i understand it, people in guilds are obligated to
come when their guild calls for them to do guild raids and such.  i've had
too many people leave groups simply for "guid reasons."

so what are the advantages/disadvantages about being in a guild?
