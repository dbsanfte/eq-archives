Well I don't know how you came by your bitterness but I have to admit
you put a smile on my face with the depth and breadth of your feeling on
the topic.  Still, when you are able, you may want to let some of that
bitterness go, for it too is a residual evil that will continue to eat
at you.  To be free from the torment you must be free of the bitterness.
