The only irony here is that Small Pox would go through the USA in record
time, and you are saying no big deal. The fact is it is in Russia. The
breakdown of the Soviet Union has made available nuclear weapons, chemical
agents, and biologicals. You can not afford to simply assume all is safe.
Besides, who knows where else it is besides locked up in the USA. You are
the kind of person who discourages reasonable, prudent, non fanatical
preparation. You are the kind of person that will kill many people in
Afghanistan telling them "Awe the US will not be attacking...".
