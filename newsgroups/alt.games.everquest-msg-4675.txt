For a wood elf warrior - go with str, and some sta.
Your base agi is 100, base dex is 80, but str and sta are 75. You'll
need str in order to be able to move with heavy armor and weapons... 
Dex will affect weapon skill raises, agility will affect your AC,
stamina influences fatigue, hitpoints, and how long you can swim
underwater. The encumberance issue for a small warrior matters more
than being able to wield a wurmslayer without being absolutely worn
out every fight, so I'd definitely go with str. Higher level hitpoints
from stamina... I don't know how much that will matter, but you will
have to get through the first levels with heavy armor, heavy weapons,
and not much looting capacity before worrying about how well you can
stand up to a dragon.
