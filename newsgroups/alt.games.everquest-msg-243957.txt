You can and should do /auction commands, such as ...  "  /auction WTS many
farmed products - pelts, silk, etc. please send tells with offers."

You also can take it "on the road." Go to PoK and "/shout stumbled on
numerous pelts...any tailors want to make reasonable offer to get them off
my hands, PST"
