Sounds like a silly scare story.

I see a LOT of in-game chat about EQW, and I've never seen or heard anybody
banned for it.

Look at their rulings.. you can ninja a really uber item, and if its a first
offence the worst you can end up with is a stupid few day suspension

And short of petitioning "Hi, the new patch has stopped my SEQ from working.
How do i fix it?" theres not much in the way of solid proof they can get to
ban you
