No, I'm not forgetting the way it is checked.  I understand exactly how it
works.  Yes, if the combat is very short, then you are right, you want a
fast weapon.  If the combat is not very short, ie. just a few seconds, then
the slower better ratio weapon will be better.  Now, I'm not suggesting that
it should be taken to the extreme, because you will get to a point where you
don't get enough checks vs dual wield to matter.  Most of the time, combat
lasts sufficiently long that it's not an issue.

I know that the average damage per hit is not the weapon damage, which does
affect this formula, which is why, in a different thread I reported the
results of running some weapons through Copelands weapon analyzer.  I will
attempt to log information over the course of time using two different
weapons, and check the results.  Have you logged such information and
analyzed it?  If so, please report the actual data, I am quite interested.
