No,this wont make me buy another buggy expansion,which probably
will hurt the game balance more.

Sorry,you can tell me what you want,I lost all trust in your ability
to fix random crashes.
Note that this hurts your revenues badly,everytime someone asked me
about EQ I have to repsond its a great game,but the crashes make it
unplayable sometimes,so I recommened *not* to get it.

Where is the fix for the bug,that randomly changes entries in the
character ini file?
Seeing it not mentioned here,can I expect it to be another long
lasting bug,which will not be fixed until the EQ servers are shut down
finally?
