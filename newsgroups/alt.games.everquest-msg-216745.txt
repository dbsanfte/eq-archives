It's at least borderline illegal and totally defeats the purpose of
the game (it absolutely violates your contract with SOE that you agree
to every time you play). You're already paying SOE to play, why shell
out even more for someone else to play FOR you?

You're also taking a HUGE risk of having your account outright stolen
(and you're paying them to do it). Sure, you can get it back, but
it'll likely be stripped by then.

Seriously, now days, if EQ is too hard for you, stick to solitaire. :p
