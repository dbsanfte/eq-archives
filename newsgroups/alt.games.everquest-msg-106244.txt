Been on many from dragons to planes, mostly exercises in mass CR
except for the rare instance where you are in a "good" group. Best I
ever saw was when a druid got his epic and wasn't interested in loot
at that one. 
You finish the 10th grade yet?

Ahh that's right EXCEPT the Warriors (melee) are getting the biggest
portion of the xp unless you go whack it once or twice instead of
medding and doing your job. 
Ninth grade even?

Warriors cant solo effectively and I see no comment on the DT spent in
groups including spawn lags, LFG, LF for more, and CR cause the puller
decided to bring back the zone.
At 31 I was making almost 1 blue bub every 8-10 minutes solo including
med time. This continued till I could quad, then things got easy.
Eighth grade??

LoL yeah right. See intelligent people know where to hunt cause we can
and do READ about a zone before hunting there. Druids don't have to
"lug" loot past level 19. Never played a druid have you? 
Seventh grade???

Hmmm lets see took a druid from 23 to 30 in the keep took a warrior
from 23 to 27 there, a cleric from 22 to 24 so yes I would say I've
seen the basement of the keep a few times. Much better out there than
the Keep. Try reading CURENT information on hunting zones. 
Sixth grade???? no?

LoL Well If one of my druids died like a 100 times in one night I
might see 40 again. Went from 39 to 54 faster than any other person in
the guild before they nerfed hell levels. Course things slowed down
now cause I'm interested in leveling one of my warriors who only
groups with a cleric and an occasional druid till he hits 40. 
Ok make this easy for you..any grade??????

No just drop Hill Giants/Ice Giants about 300 times.Its  not hard when
you keep all the loot, get all the xp, never die, hunt any time you
want any where you want, sell loot, bank, and be hunting again in 2
minutes round trip, and can look morons in the eye and laugh. Had
enough yet? You cant win you know....
