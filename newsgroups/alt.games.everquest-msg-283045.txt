Don't people ever get tired of chasing the carrot? I recently returned from 
short time away, and it's remarkable how much EQ has changed... In my opinion 
for the worse. Not a single person from my friends list remains, and those I 
meet are 2,3,4,5 and even 6 boxing. This seems to indicate, that whatever number 
of subscriptions are claimed, the actual number of players is dwindling. A 
dangerous situation whereby the collapse of the game becomes quite possible in a 
very short period.

Given LDoN, a real fear is that everything will be in one instanced zone, lol!

And this should make us feel good about the new one?

As for me, my stay will be a short one. I have promised a few people my 
assistance, but when my promises are kept, it's off to exile for me once again. 
This time, I don't have a feeling of leaving an old friend behind, but one of 
good riddance. Sad for what was a great game......
