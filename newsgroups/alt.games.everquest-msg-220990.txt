And I see you CAN'T argue ONE FACT in the site. So instead you try to
demonize the writers... Hmmm... Typical liberal response. You really
should try a little harder.

>Pathetic. I guess its only fair though. Their is no objective media... 
>just fanatics on both sides. 

Ahhh... painting the other side with your brush. Moore's a fanatic, as
are his liberal buddies, so the rest of us must be as well. Isn't it
possible we aren't fanatics? That maybe we're just sick of all the
liberal bullshit? Oh no... that would make us better than you in your
eyes...

You're right. The disarmed zones are dangerous to the youth of this
country. Arm teachers, and this sort of thing will stop. Look at Pearl
Mississippi as a perfect example. Arm the common man and crime will
drop. That's been proven in 31 states out of 50. The other 19 are
still holding on to the lie of the left.

It was a point by point walk through of your Hero's lies. So, yeah,
there is no reason. You have no argument at all. How can you argue the
facts? But can you understand the meaning of the word "reason"???

> The arguments on this site are about as biased as Bowling 
>was, as any media is. 

What? They showed Mr. Moore's lies one at a time. Yeah, they were
biased, but their FACTS weren't.

>(And most of the arguments were trivial too... I 

Ahhh... you can't refute it, so you seek top trivialize it. I see...

I never take ANYONE at face value. You're the one who was quoting the
bloated sack.

>needs to be taken with a gain of salt.

No the rest of us aren't. Otherwise, he souldn't be calling the people
who wrote "moorelies" slanderers. PLUS he wouldn't have been given an
Oscar for a DOCUMENTARY. Not a piece of fiction, DOCUMENTARY. Do you
know what a DOCUMENTARY is supposed to be? So much for your
assertation.

Not my site... I just found it among many when I put in Michael Moore

But see... there you go trying to think. It was a response to the
"Stupid White Men" title from your hero. But you didn't call HIM a
racist for that title. Well I do. He's a racist and a bloated sack.

>

He wrangled the timeline to fit his story. NOT something to be done in
a documentary. But then, I guess you don't have any respect for truth,
or you wouldn't be trying to support Moore.

Not when it was a response to Moore's book title.

Yeah, why ARE you so fixated on it?

Are you intentionally obtuse?

Yeah just you, a person who supports a known liar. Hmmm... makes me
REALLY want to believe you...
