Quote from the Eqloft forum: If you live outside the US and wanna play on an
existing server you need to import the US version of PoP. The Euro version
will onlwork with the new servers, apparently.
What gives?


"After seeing PoP on amazon.com with the release date of October 22nd...
then read they are NOT exporting it to Europe... ok i said
Went to amazon.co.uk - PoP release date = 13th December 2002... WTF

I emailed VI and asked WTF was this about and got a response saying UBISOFT
are in charge of UK distripution

After seeing this I phoned UBI Soft here in UK and asked when POP is being
released.

Was told that it will be late November and that the version will only work
on the upcoming Euro server.

The guy I spoke to said I would need to buy it from the US to be able to
play PoP on my current server."
