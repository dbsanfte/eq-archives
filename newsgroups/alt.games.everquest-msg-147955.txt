	No, eventually the superior force kills everyone who is willing to die
over the issue, and then it _stops_.  The further away you get from the
original issue the fewer people you're going to find who even care, let alone
will be willing to die over it.

	Keep in mind, again, that I am not in favor of such extreme actions on
this issue.  My response to the 9/11 bombings would have been to hold services
for the slain, send spooks out to find to bad guys and either bring them in or
kill them, rebuild the buildings exactly as they were and get on with life.
When drawing up a list of possible response, "starting another war" wouldn't
have made the first cut.

|All of them? Short of sending the entire planet back to the stone age
|including yourselves that will be a tad difficult.

	I disagree.

	Your argument is predicated on the assumption that the entire world will
rise up in vengeance if overwhelming force is brought to bear on absolutely
anyone.  I assert that this is complete and utter nonsense.

|Remember your own

	We have an excellent crop of extremist nutcases!

|possibility of now. Don't think you could stop at the Arabs afterwards.

	Of *course* we could.  No sane, developed nation wants to fight a shooting
war against a superpower, not even (especially even) another superpower.  They
would sell themselves the plausable lie (which wouldn't even be a lie) that we
were defending ourselves, and let it go.

|And that can be used against you as well - that is terrorism is all about.

	No, terrorism is just an extremely poor form of warfare adopted by people
who can't use effective forms and can't bring themselves to stop fighting.  It
does nothing to damage the enemy's ability to wage war or project force, and
if you're not damaging those abilities you're pissing into the wind.

|Then I fail to see why any Country on earth should be concerned acts like
|Sept 11. If the US put's itself in the same league as the terrorists, what
|concern of it of ours if you killing each other?

	None whatsoever -- feel free to stay out of it entirely.

	We can handle it ourselves.  So much the better if we're allowed to.

|If the Mideast was hypothetically-vacated the rest of the world would
|already see itself against the wall. Whose next?

	I imagine that leaders of other nations would "express their concerns" to
our leaders, and our leaders would probably say something like "well, if you
don't crash jet liners into our skyscrapers, you're probably safe."

	Mind you, if your nation doesn't have the power to end all life on earth,
its opinion doesn't matter.

|People who are willing to die without pause are the most cost effective
|tools used by those "powers/forces" and it is hatred which breeds them.

	No, they're not.  They are very good at causing civilian casualties and
totally useless at inflicting meaningful damage.

|Breed hatred and you make it easier for them to strike you - and cheaper.
|Removing that hatred takes generations of tolerance and restraint.

	No, it takes generations of eugenics -- kill enough of them and you'll
breed the Stupidity Gene out of their gene pool

|Wouldn't it just be easier for the entire planet to rid itself of these
|hypothetical genocidal yanks rather than let them get rid of everyone else

	We're back to that 'shooting war against a superpower' thing.

|But your <always> paying the Danegeld, that is precisely what has brought
|you have the Danes. Just about every bitter enemy you have are the former
|regimes you have supported and their enemies. US Danegelding is the core of
|the hatred.

	Look..."hatred" has nothing to do with it.  This is a key point that you
need to grasp.  Nations do not go to war over hate, and the terrorism we are
discussing is state-sponsored.  It does not matter how much they hate us; if
they don't have a nation supporting their efforts, they are impotent.

|BTW - you already have a history of capitulation to terrorists, ie Mideast
|arms for hostages farce.

	And I agree that was a stupid thing to do.  But it was attempted because
bleeding-heart liberals would have conniptions if the US government tried the
proper response to hostage-taking.  (IE: hold funerals for the hostages and
then get on with life.)

|Then why should we care if a couple of million of you guys are wiped out in
|a biological attack tommorow?

	You shouldn't.  Let us deal with it.

|
|A gamble, not a given.

	They didn't the last time, the won't this time and they won't next time,
either.

|> Of course you can.  OPEC has been buying peace with oil for decades.
|
|And they have had lasting peace?

	How lasting do you want it to be?

|Good point. Just remember it applies to you as well as everyone else : )

	I'm fine with that.  I wish our government was as well -- there is no
reason for us to act as if our affairs were the entire world's business.
