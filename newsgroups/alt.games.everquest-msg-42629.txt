Like I said, if less than $4 a month makes a big difference, I'd
rethink the whole pay-for-play issue. That's *me*, your mileage, as
always, may vary.

I don't *like* it, either. So far, the difference between "Allakhazam
with banners that take 30 seconds to load and crash the browser" and
"Allakhazam without banners" is worth 3 bucks a month to me. If it
stops being so, I'll stop paying for it.

Everlore made an attempt, some time back to move to a paid-membership
model (where this stands now, I can't say, as I rarely look at
Everlore anymore). EQprices.com had, at one point, some sort of paid
membership plan; again, I don't know where this stands at present. No
doubt others will offer additional examples.

There, you'll get exactly no argument from *me*. If it were *me*, I'd
lose the background image,  compress the jpegs (and remove the
majority of them), use frames to prevent reloading the same damned
menu table over and over, move the comments area off of just about
every page on the site (if I, for some reason, want to see 50 people
arguing about why J_random_mob is or isn't underconned or permanently
offering to buy J_random_phat_lewt, give me a link to a forum where
that is going on, not forcibly put it up on virtually every page
load). But it's not me.

Generally, you don't. This is, I think, a function of 1) allowing
users to upload image files through an automated process (rarely, if
ever, a good idea, in my experience) and 2) because people will
(apparently) argue endlessly about whether or not the submission is
correct unless a screen shot also appears. These people, clearly have
never heard of Photoshop, but I digress. And when the mob is question
is trying to eat my head will be soon enough to see it, in my opinion.

I would assume that a lot of what "should be done" in an ideal world
(filtering out the crap - the lame attempts to tweak asking prices on
loot by skewing the numbers, the repetitive, the idiotic, etc.- is
not, in fact, either practical or possible, given that there isn't a
"massive staff" handling the site, it's just these guys dealing with
it in their spare time. A fairly extensive amount of this sort of
content can still be accessed for free (for now) from other sites, at
least until the people leaving Allahkhazam overload their
(graphics-heavy, bandwidth-intensive) sites and the process begins all
over again.
