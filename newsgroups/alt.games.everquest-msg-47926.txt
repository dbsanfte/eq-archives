So does a stopwatch, or even better, ANYONE who is non-KOS who just stands
at the spawn point and watches for them. They spawn in exactly the same
spot every time. Doesn't take a ranger to find them.

Or if you have a reasonably intelligent person running a stopwatch, you get
20+ minutes to prep for them, with a countdown too.

Your corpse draggers are really incompetant if they ever die...unless they
are trying to drag from the base of Tunare's tree. I've run scouting duty
on a dozen PoG raids, including some of the very first ones on the server
where nobody had the first damn clue how the zone worked (and thus, were
frequently wiped out), and the only time I died was when I asked prince
thirneg if he had any phat lewtz for me (the rumor was too funny to not
test out).
