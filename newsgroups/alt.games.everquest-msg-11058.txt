Subject: Warrior dual wield - which weapon in which hand?

Conventional EQ wisdom is that the faster weapon should always go in the
primary hand even if a higher damage/delay weapon goes in the off hand.  The
theorty is that this will increase number of times that bonuses are used.  I
just don't see this.

Sure you are going to get a bonus more often from faster weapon;  however, is
it not true that the size of the bonus is going to be the same ratio as the
damage of the weapon?  This has to be true for a lot of the bonus components
such as Crits, Crippling Blows, and strength/speed increases.

A non-damage proc might make a difference (a damage proc should be factored in
as an increase in damage/delay ratio).  However, in general, it seems to me
that the better weapon should go in primary hand.
