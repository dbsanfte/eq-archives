I've been badgering him for the past couple of days ... at this point if I
were to say that the sky was blue, he'd argue over what shade of blue it
actually was.  But still, I figured I'd try to give it one more try with a
detailed (if somewhat verbose) example.

And, sadly, I got just about the response I was expecting.

He's changed from apologetic to belligerent at the drop of a hat ... and I
believe he's been dropping the hat himself.  I half expected to start see
the old "I'm sorry, my kid somehow got access to my account" dodge.
