My favorite was chain-healing assorted tanks (/assist on Nagafen until I
find someone who's hurting) .. He ignored the dozen and a half tanks beating
on him and charged for me (didn't summon) and proceeded to kill me. I think
it went like this ..

Lord Nagafen says, 'JUST ..'
Lord Nagafen has hit YOU for 255 points of damage!
Lord Nagafen has hit YOU for 255 points of damage!
Lord Nagafen says, 'SHUT ..'
Lord Nagafen has hit YOU for 255 points of damage!
Lord Nagafen has hit YOU for 255 points of damage!
Lord Nagafen says, 'UP ..'

Lord Nagafen says, 'AND ..'
Lord Nagafen has hit YOU for 255 points of damage!
Lord Nagafen says, 'DIE!!'
Lord Nagafen has hit YOU for 255 points of damage!
You have been slain by Lord Nagefen!
