    Warslik's is an awesome place for the 20's. The giant fort and the brute
caves are plat mines with great XP. And the Bandit Lord camp has one of the
gimpiest boss mobs in game for his level, one that drops a melee bracer that
melees will likely use for some time (Bracer of Scavenging). The tough part
about the zone is getting there!
