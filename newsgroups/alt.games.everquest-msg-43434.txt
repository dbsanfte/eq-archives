Hello all,
I wanted to update you all on our current thoughts regarding the Trivial
Loot Code as it relates to Shadows of Luclin
zones.

As per my last couple of 'Ask Brads', we've made both an effort to explain
what the Trivial Loot Code does and why
we were considering it for all Luclin zones. I'd also mentioned, however,
that if most players appeared to be against
its inclusion we'd not use it.

After talking with players, reading emails and feedback, and then very
recently running a poll, it is indeed apparent
that the majority of our playerbase does not feel that the Loot Code's
advantages outweigh its restrictions.

In fact, after polling over 200,000 players, most want the looting system
left alone, almost as many want us to
explore a different solution for bottom feeding and rampant farming, and a
minority were in favor of the Trivial Loot
Code as it exists today in the Warrens and Stonebrunt Mountains (the
remainder either didn't have an opinion or
were unfamiliar with TLC).

Well, so be it

We will head back to our drawing boards and keep brainstorming on this
issue, but at this current time we do NOT
intend on implementing TLC for the zones in our upcoming expansion, the
Shadows of Luclin.

I do want to thank everyone for all the feedback and discussion regarding
this issue -- there was a lot of debate
surrounding this issue, and we've done our best to pay attention.
