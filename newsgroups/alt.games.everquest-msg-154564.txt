All--

I'm in the process of switching over to positive Brood of DiZok
faction by clearing out the mines of Droga repeatedly. It's boring and
repetetive, but profitable work.

At the same time, people in the Bazaar are begging for Mind Melts.
Since my poison making is already 130+, I was thinking that it might
be worth the effort to start making them. But, I have a couple of
questions I don't know the answer to:

(1) Does poison making count as a trade skill for the "one
grandmaster" clause? I've already got a 210 in fletching.

(2) Are there poison-making Geerlocks?

(3) Are there any droppable +make poison items out there?

TIA to those who know.
