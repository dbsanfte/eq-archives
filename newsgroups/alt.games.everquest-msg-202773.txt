This "fix" should have been done a year and a half ago.  As for saying that
all the whining caused other buffs to get nerfed, It didn't.  None of the
spells that are now level limited where suposed to be cast on a low level
character.  Even before if you tried to cast one of the greats on a lowbe
directly it wouldn't let you.  If it hadn't been for the cast on your self
bug than none of the great buffes would have ever been given out to a LooB.
It is too bad that now you have to fight with buffs of your level, if you
can get them frome the people that you used to snuff because there spells
where inferior to what you had on you.

KEI, Aego, PoT9 you will be missed, for a little while.  Now I have more
reason to get my new character to 46+, i had been doing the slow thing
keeping down with my friends, but now they will just have tocatch up.

The one thing that does suck is that the lower levels that had been revamped
because they wher to easy are now going to be unbearable without full
groups.  OHHH wait that is what they wanted.  Never mind.   Good move SoE.
