DUH!!
As he stated in his original post.... He is doing "Call of Flame"
spell  quest and needs the item The Hand drops! The Adamite Band <---
Sure I spelled that wrong> hehe

Why bother trying to solo hand! My ranger got it at 51 but he was in
mage group and they pulled the hand.
Or get in hand group if there is one.

I still haven't finished quest... need the stupid fangs from MM and
the  burnt sash from Sol B

Have yet  been able to get  in a GEBS raid or imp group.
I tried going in there solo.. but can't get past them frigging sonic
bats. Man those guys are tough for flying rats!!
