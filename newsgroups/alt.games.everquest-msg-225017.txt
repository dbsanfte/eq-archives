Doesn't /gsay tend to catch your eye in the chat window moreso than
/say, well, before the customizable colors were implemented? I'd
consider that easier. Everyone hears you, not just those in the
immediate proximity. 

Also, there doesn't have to be a grouping bonus to make it more
efficient. The simple fact that you can spread the damage around and
drop the mobs much faster takes care of that.

The point is that if you had grouped, you would have gone through more
mobs in the same timeframe. I understand your claim that what you were
doing was effectively grouping and therefore should not have carried any
disadvantages. However, I just don't see the reasoning behind avoiding
grouping merely for the sake of avoiding grouping - not that I believe
for a moment that casual soloing even under those circumstances is as
efficient as coordinated efforts would have been. You were all
simulating a group after all. Why not just group? You were making a
conscious effort to provide all the advantage to each other that
grouping includes after all.

No, but you *can* make two groups of 4 or 5. No, you don't *have* to use
the grouping construct. I would like to here a good reason *not* to
though. As I mentioned, you've described a scenario where you duplicated
the behavior of a group, yet had no interest in grouping. The mere
communication aspect and greater efficiency (yes, it would be noticeably
greater as long as the spawn rate was sufficient, and if it wasn't
sufficient, then there were too many of you there to begin with) makes
it a good idea. 

I can understand that someone might just plain prefer not to group for
whatever reason. I just find the claim that there is no downside to
avoiding grouping in the described scenario indefensible.
