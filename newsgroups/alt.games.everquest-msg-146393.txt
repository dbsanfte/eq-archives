Help!
I'm a level 37 cleric and having a hard time finding pick up groups.
This is my main.  I chose a cleric because I like the role and wanted
to group.  I usually only play once a week for a 4 hour stretch.  Once I
get a group, I stick with it.  I had some luck finding groups in OT, but the
xp was getting slow.  I think I'm good at my role, but am still learning
(that's what I enjoy).  I currently trying SolB, but finding it hard to get
into groups.  I was there last night for almost an hour with no luck.
I think my current guild is drying up.

What advice do you have for me?
Hunt in zone???
Join a better guild, like ???
Choose another server and start over (arggg!) like ???
Is there another way to look for a group other than "shouting" in a zone?
