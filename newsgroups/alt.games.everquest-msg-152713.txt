    Log on the tracking mules and see what's up! Having a bunch of low-level
rangers spread around the world can really, really help in finding targets
fast.

    As you say later, this tells you where not to go. This also doesn't tell
you much if your competition likes to go /role or /anon to defeat such
simple tracking. Having a person in the zone you're wondering about is much
better - you can see what's up there, what guilds are there, and even better
how many people those guilds have there. If you have an acrimonious
relationship with a guild you may want to race them for a target if they
don't have many in the zone yet, or you might want to race any guild if you
see they don't have many people online period.

    We do any number of the following:

-log on the tracking mules.
-ask the other guild leaders "what're you heading for"? This only works
because we get along fairly well, and there aren't a huge number of guilds
at our level of target.
-have someone in guild ask a friend in another guild what's up. They usually
spill the beans. ;-)
-already be there when it pops. We track when everything dies, so we know
when it's expected to re-pop and plan where we'll be accordingly.
