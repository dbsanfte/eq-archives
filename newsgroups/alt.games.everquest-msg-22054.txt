Hey,

I was suffering from those lag-storms (that occasionally become lag-deaths)
too... the type where the world goes quiet and you wonder if you're dying or
not... A friend mentioned to me that what he's learned on numerous plane
raids is that sometimes you have to remind the server that you're still
there. To do this, make a hotkey with "/serverfilter on" in it. There have
been a few times that I've dropped to 80% packet loss, and with repeated
mashings of the key, have quickly jumped back to 0%. What it seems to do is
send fast pings to the server to acknowledge your presence, and reminds the
server to filter out all the extraneous information, already. That having
been said, if the evil gods of Lag decide that you're going to die a
lingering death and sever your connection, there's sweet FA you can do about
it. :)
I know that the thrust of your topic was the fact that the zone bugged out
on you - I'm just suggesting that maybe if you use this, you might at least
know where you are by staying on-line long enough to get somewhere safe
before the world collapses.

Hope it works for ya. :)

Pax,

N S K
