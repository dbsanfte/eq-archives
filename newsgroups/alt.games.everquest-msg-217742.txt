If Phinny doesnt see invis (and I think he does), some of his guards
certainly do. The mage would barely make it off the ledge where people fight
Phinny. I am (er, was) a 65 mage who died a lot fooling around down there.
:P

It'd take only a bit longer to get a group or two down there and clear the
room. Killing Phinny is easy, the guards are a pain though...
