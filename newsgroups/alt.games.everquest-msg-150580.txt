Never gave this much thought before, but I know that people must have
mapped this out long ago.

After the servers go down and come back up, I assume that it's "memory"
is wiped as to the last time mob_01 spawned. I also assume that not
*everything* in the game immediately spawns.

I'm currently on an endless and fruitless search for some rarer epic
mobs, along with others in my guild.  After a patch, is there a know
time or <time frame> before things like:

The Shissar mob for the Chanter epic spawn in fear? 
Broken Golem?
The minis in Fear and Hate?
How about VS/VSR? 
The Kunark Dragons? (Got a warrior hot to camp Sev after this week's
patch. All he needs now is that green scale and the spiroc blade.)
