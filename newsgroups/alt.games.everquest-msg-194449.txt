Journeyboots are droppable on my server. I bought and sold it all the
time. Not sure about your server. When I go to Bazaar, there is always
people shooting for JBoots for sale, 5000pp...

Goulbane is not droppable anymore, but there are tons of droppable
Goulbanes still floating around. My 2nd paladin still bought one of
this for 300pp.

BTW, Sky's Paladin, Warrior, General Everquest guide has moved to 
http://www.buyeverquestguide.com
You can still read free samples there. Or you can always check on
eBay.

Cheers,
