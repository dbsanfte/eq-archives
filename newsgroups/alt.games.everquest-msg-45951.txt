Ok, I just have to ask. What's the "safety zone" at 60? I know in the
high forties, fifty that EJ can be the safety zone, but that's got to be
green to a warlord. Where do you go?

I know the primals drop in ST (not that I'll ever see one.) Never even
heard of Jaelens or NevHorn. Also, which Sceptre, who the hell is Lord
Koi and what's with his AC Orb? (Man, am I pathetically clueless or
what?)

It's my understanding (of course, this could be completely fucking
wrong) that once you do the 4th warder, the sleeper wakes up, he's awake
for good, and the warders never spawn again so nobody else can ever get
any primal vellium. That doesn't sound like something Verant would do,
but if it is, I can see how an uberguild doing that would become *very*
unpopular with any up and coming large guilds. <g>

Thanks for the insight into a part of the game most of us don't ( and
many will *never*) get to see.
