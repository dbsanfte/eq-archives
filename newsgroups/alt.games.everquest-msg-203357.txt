And you've typed *how* many lines over how many posts ranting
about this *one* issue?

You're either trolling or have no experience at all with the high-end
game (say, 50+).

Regardless of your apparent belief that such skills are quickly and
trivially learned, in my experiences as one of the leaders of a
raid alliance, no, they're not.  They *ought* to be, but they're not.
I've had to halt way too many raids in the middle in order to teach
"EQ 101" to half the attendees, so that we wouldn't all wipe out *again*.

And it's not like there's just that *one* particular wizard/nuking/aggro
thing to learn, there are hundreds of others like them which all
have to be learned before someone can even be considered "moderately
competent" in a raid situation.

Way too many people make it to 50+ without having learned enough of
them to be even useful in a raid.  Many players, in fact, are downright
dangerous and a major liability to the raid.

I've got dozens of stories I could tell detailing particular examples,
but seeing how you blew off Crash's attempt to explain one to you
in detail, I'm going to have to presume that my attempts would
be a waste of time as well.

But your ability to unceremoniously blow off what people tell you
doesn't magically make your position any stronger.  Quite the contrary,
in fact.


>  Cmon, it's just a game and you're kidding yourself.  

If it's "just a game", then you shouldn't be bent out of shape
over the KEI change, or you should be able to play this "just a game"
just as well without KEI, no?
