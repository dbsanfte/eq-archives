Sometimes you just get off to a bad start (or in the case of Luclin, didn't
set rampage properly / lost the RT)

We've wiped on a mob, then killed it after the C.R, with less people (same
core members, just a few from the raid logging). And not in the numbers that
could attribute it to lag, but enough to make a sizable difference in dps.

Actually, we've done that quite a few times!
