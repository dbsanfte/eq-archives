hes also very very wrong . for soloing it is still

necros
magicians
shamans
(druids and wizards and bards and chanters )
clerics
shadowknights
monks
other tanks and semis

also for twinking purposes tanks gain a HUGE advantage and casters gain
squat from a good twinking. My 4th character I am playing around with is a
twinked iksar monk and he levels far easier solo than any of my previous
casters . He would come behind them though if not for the excellant gear he
started with .
