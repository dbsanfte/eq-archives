They raised the skill cap because Taunt became nigh-useless to those
classes at higher levels.  But if you're losing agro to a knight who
is taunting then you're grouped with an idiot.  Knights normally
generate less hate than Warriors because they cannot dual-wield, which
allows them to melee alongside a Warrior without taking agro.  Knights
can generate more hate than a Warrior via their spells, and they can
do it quickly while the Warrior's only way to get more hate fast is a
successful Taunt or a lucky string of +hate procs.  This is what makes
knights good for off-tanking and pulling mobs off casters.  It also
allows a high level knight to tank successfully even when grouped with
idiots who have no clue how to manage their own agro.

You're grouping with incompetent players.  In the bad old days players
like that would hit the wall somewhere between L20 and L45, unable to
get into groups they would either solo or quit.  Now, with KEI for
any fool with a few pp, and formerly extreme levels of twinking being
commonplace, and plenty of KEI'd knights eagerly generating enormous
amounts of hate, they make it to fairly high levels with ease.

*shrug*
Making the game easier is a GoodThing[tm], right?
Every server must be filled to the brim with lackwitted dolts who
have no idea how to play their character well, right?
The game is too hard if your nephew/uncle/half-brother/second-cousin
(that's just one person) can't make it to L50 in a month, right?

I'd go on, but it's time to go home and I have to walk, uphill through
6-foot snowdrifts under the burning sun, so i'd best get started.
