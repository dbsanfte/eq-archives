Check out http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4140, the
guy from Mages Compendium asking some questions of Mr. Vancouvering.

Q: Now that pets are capable of zoning with their masters why donï¿½t
they? 

A: Some do, some don't.  The familiar is, essentially, a buff with a
visual representation.  The warder zones, but it loses its buffs when
it does so.  In reality all pets need to be 'recast' when the owner
zones.  The warder gets all tiny when he zones and the buffs needed to
bring him back to speed are very much in line with a Mage recasting
his pet.  Basically, we decided not to dramatically change that part
of gameplay.
