On Povar recently a toon named Seab agreed to do a transfer for a friend.  When
my friend logged back he found Seab gone.  Seab has refused to return the items
and has instead kept them.  He will not answer any tells from the owner of the
items.  Since stealing the items Seab has gone from lvl 13 to lvl 30 in 5 Days
(since he is twinked out with stolen high level gear!)  It is very disturbing
to all who know and respect the victim, because he is as fine and honorable
person as can be found.

We are all aware that the owner made a mistake in trusting Seab.  We also are
aware that EQ can/will do nothing because of their warnings about making
transfers like this.  But most of us have had to rely on people for transfers
at some point.  Fortunately most have higher ethics and morals than this Seab
guy, but the potential for this exists everyday in EQ and EQ is unable or
unwilling to help deal with it.  

How should this problem be handled?  Is there anything that can be done to
bring about some semblence if justice in this? Anyone else been in this
situation? 
 Any helpful advice appreciated.  The guy who lost the stuff is rebuilding and
moving on, but as his friends we are trying to help however we can.  

Thanks!
