Hello Gornul,

To me a well rounded group fills six basic roles.  These are healing,
crowd control, tanking, pulling, snaring, melee damage.  There are
other valuable skills out there, but these are the things I would want
in a group to feel like we could handle just about anything a single
group would normally encounter.  The melee damage could probably be
replaced with spell damage, but I prefer melee damage classes because
they can handle getting a couple hits when they get agro, and they
don't have to worry about running out of mana or resists.

For each of these roles the classes I would choose from are:
Healing - Cleric
Crowd Control - Enchanter
Tanking - Shadowknight, Warrior
Pulling - Shadowknight, Monk
Snaring - Shadowknight, Druid, Ranger, Wizard, Necro
Melee Damage - Rogue, Monk

The following are some abilities I like to have in a group, but aren't
really as vital to me: (I know there are other classes that have some
of these abilities, but these are the ones I would pick if I were
looking for a class with a specific ability.)
Resurrection - Cleric
Slow - Shaman, Enchanter
Haste - Shaman, Enchanter, Bard
Regeneration - Shaman, Druid, Bard
Group Teleportation - Druid, Wizard
Corpse Summoning - Necromancer, Shadowknight
Mana Regen - Enchanter, Bard
SoW - Druid, Shaman, Ranger
Tracking - Druid, Ranger, Bard
Harmony - Druid, Ranger
Lockpicking - Rogue
Damage Shields - Druid, Magician
Disarm Traps - Rogue (I've heard this is more useful in some places in
Luclin, but I haven't experienced it yet)

The group I would go with is Cleric/Enchanter/Shadowknight (This takes
care of all the vital roles except damage dealer.) and . . .
Monk. -  Good melee damage, and it's nice to have two people who can
pull so your puller doesn't get burnt out.
 - or -
Rogue - You lose your second puller, but increase your melee damage a
bit compared to the monk, plus get lockpicking, and disarm traps.
 - or -
Ranger - Your melee damage output would suffer some compared to a monk
or rogue, but you would gain better snare, tracking, harmony, and SoW.
 Also, with harmony rangers can often pull pretty well outdoors.  The
biggest reason I would consider a ranger for the last spot is for the
more reliable snare.  The shadowknight can do the job, but their snare
spells have a short duration which can cause problems if the sk
forgets to recast it.

The only downside I see transportation, but it's usually pretty easy
to find a porter to take you where you want to go if you make it worth
their time.  Better yet you could find a good druid to become part of
your group.  Then you could stick with the higher damage of the rogue
or monk for your fourth spot because the druid could snare.
