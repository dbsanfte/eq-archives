    Perhaps have a reverse of the EQ model: offensive casters don't have
mana until they hit a hate list, at which point they start to build mana up.
So the combat model would be tanks holding mobs at bay until the
wizard-types build up enough power to let fly and finish things. As soon as
an offensive caster leaves all hate lists, their remaining mana goes poof.
The priest-type casters could have EQ-style mana, so they'd slowly lose the
ability to support the tanks as the battle progressed.
