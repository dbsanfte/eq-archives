You ask 600,000 people to unlock their doors for 2 minutes many of whome 
had their doors locked by friends and family members.

What percentage are going to remember to lock them again.

Admittedly the majority of people are running with their doors unlocked 
to start, but even so, this perpetuates that bad practice.

No. There is truly a minute risk there.

The real risk is the long term fallout of getting everyone's doors 
unlocked (for no good reason) in the first place. Not every one is going 
to remember to lock them again afterwards, or they'll fail to lock it 
back up as tight, leaving a few holes.

The people crying foul are not really at risk themselves. They're savvy 
enough to recognize the issues, and take all the necessary steps 
aftwards. They are pissed that Sony is making them take those steps, for 
no good reason, and they are rightly concerned that joe public with a 
secured PC (secured by a friend for example) is going to get his system 
opened up and have no idea how nor inclination to secure it again.
