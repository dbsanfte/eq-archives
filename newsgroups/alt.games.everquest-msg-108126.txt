Definitely nice to not have invis drop in the middle of a hostile area.

The sirens are EBIL. They lure you in with their bare breasts, stun you, and
then charm you to do their bidding.  At least they don't see invis (although
there is some shark out there that attacked me while invis once)

Remember the SG entrance from CS is underwater at first, then at the zone
line itself is dry.  The zone in is safe barring trains, however when you
egress/succor across, you will pop in on top of an Enthralled Walrus, which
is non-kos, however there's a wandering Hulk thing (bulthar/ulthork/molkor,
don't remember which) that will attack you sometimes in that area, and the
walruses and such will attack.  Once you egress, take the tunnel on the
right, invis at the end of it, and zone out to WW.
