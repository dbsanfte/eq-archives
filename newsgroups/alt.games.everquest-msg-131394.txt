Yes, every time you swing a weapon you have a (small) chance of
raising the weapon skill.  As double attack means more swings it
means more chances at raising the skill at the weapon (s) you are
swinging.

Any time you swing a weapon you have the chance (same chance regardless
of what hand or whether a main attack or double attack...) of its improving.
Until your skill at duel wield goes up you won't see very many attacks with
your offhand weapon, which means not many chances for it to go up, but it
can and will happen occaisionally, more and more often as your duel weild
skill goes up.  Just as you'll see lots of strikes with your hand and only a few

with your offhand 1HB in your example, you'll see lots of HTH skill ups and
only a few 1HB skill ups.

No, the two attack ratings are completely unrelated.  Unfortunately there
is no display for the attack rating of your offhand weapon.  Still, if you put
a weapon you are very unskilled at in your primary hand and one you
are highly skilled at in your secondary hand, then look at hits versus misses
you'll notice your secondary weapon hits a lot more often (per swing) than
your primary weapon.

Buffs that raise your attack appear to raise attack on both primary and
secondary, although again since there's no display of your attack rating for
the secondary weapon its hard to say for sure.

They are entirely independant of each other.  You can ignore your primary
weapon here as far as your secondary weapon is concerned.  With attack
on, your secondary weapon will check the dual weild skill at the delay
rate of your secondary weapon, and you will swing if thats successful, either
way you will then wait that secondary weapon delay again before your
next check.  Can have a primary weapon swinging at 17 intervals or at 80
intervals
and it won't effect secondary weapon delay one bit.

What -will- help is a low delay weapon, all the Haste you can get, and getting
that Dual Weild skill up as high as you can as fast as you can (which means
blowing your Dex up thru the roof if you can arrange that)  Lower delay and
haste means more dual weild checks, which will mean more possible swings but
also which will raise dual weild itself faster.  Getting dual weild up means
more
swings as well.  Dex will help raise dual weild... and oh by the way will get
you
more successful skill ups when you -are- checking them.

Lets see, what else.  Dual weild goes up regardless of what you are attacking.
One
option is to go farm green mobs for some low risk training, say going after
skellies
for their bone chips, or spiders for their silks (now selling at 40pp a stack
due to
the POTC/Earring quest) or any faction mob you may wish to bash a while.  Weapon

skills only go up on exp mobs, and seem to go up more when you are hitting, but
also
more the higher level the mob is relative to you.  This means going after yellow
mobs
is probably the best plan, you should be able to hit them a lot but still have
much
better skill up chances relative to low blues.  One plan, therefore, is to
approach
groups killing mobs at around this level and ask if you can bash their mobs for
skill ups.  Good planning here is to also go after mobs that are faction to you
so
you are seeing a secondary benefit.  On the other hand, a good group should be
able to support you going after yellows and that way you'll be getting exp and
loot as well while you fight, altogether a better option if you can find a good
group.
Soloing a bunch of low blues is the slowest way to raise your skills.

Glad to stick my two bits out and see who wants to knock them back down!
