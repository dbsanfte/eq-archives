Not sure what the stats are on the human warrior newbie armor.  Maybe 
looted bronze armor.  Crafted armor is the next questable set I can think 
of off hand, not sure on the level you will want for that, but I am 
thinking 20s to 30s somewhere in there.  If you aren't against buying 
armor, shop the bazaar.
