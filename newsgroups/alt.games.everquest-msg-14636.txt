So. In summary; people who don't respect Verant don't THINK. Is that
what you're saying? And you wonder why you've gained a label as a VAK?

What about people who respect and praise Verant on some issues, but
condemn them on others, where they feel it is justified? Are they only
occasional THINKers?

Such as going around dealing with petitions on names... and other
urgently important stuff like that?

You don't. 

You've already stated that "The whole story bores me to
tears". I bet I know where the boredom set in. Immediately between
reading VI's version of events and CQ's version. After all, mustn't
cloud the issue with pesky little things like both sides of the story,
must we?

Wrong on both counts. Read some of Dan Day's posts. I, too, read the
entire log after they were summoned to the Arena. It was tragic to see
the transcript of a guild's death... and the prospect of suspensions
and/or bannings. All before a detailed analysis of the logs and the
raid's actions was fully understood by VI.

This isn't what they were doing.

Of course it does! Unless your definition of "average player" means
someone who will never raid places with an "uber mob"... no matter how
long they play.

I'd rather like to know what is and what is not a bannable offence
*before* I commit it, rather than after. Verant show zero consistency
on this issue, and need just this kind of player backlash from the EQ
community from time to time when their actions are suspect.

In this case, their actions are suspect.
