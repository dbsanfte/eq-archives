Sense and remove traps skills are easy to cap; just tie them to your 
left and right turn arrows.  Pick pockets is not a crucial skill, other 
than getting your epic or ripping off your friends (or strangers) its 
not useful at all.  Sneak and Hide are certainly worth working on, but 
not really hard to do either, and harder to work on in combat than not; 
again, just tie them to your left and right arrows  and work on them 
while running around POK or your home town or the bazaar.

I can't think of any reason not to go ahead and level up for anything 
but combat skills, if it takes 2000 tries at sneak to get it to 200 
skill, it doesn't matter whether you do those 100 at a time, each time 
you level, or 2000 all at once at 50th level.  As with caster skills, if 
you -stop- PLing at some point, then you need to take a long boring day 
and force feed the skills too... but since they aren't combat skills, 
thats no hardship.

If a rogue benefits from 1hs and 1hb and archery and throwing skills, 
then there's a little reason to level up a bit more slowly, as usually 
people find its easier to level those skills on lower level mobs.

More important, though, would be to work defense skills up at low 
levels; these are Really hard for most classes to work on with high 
level mobs, yet they are beneficial when taking incedental damage, or 
when forced by a mezed or dead MT to take over no matter how poorly you 
might fare relatively speaking... oddly, its this skill thats -best- 
served by PLing, at least in the traditional DS and heals format; the 
PLee is getting hit a lot more than a rogue in a traditional group ever 
will.

Hide, Sneak, Backstab, Piercing, Defense, Offense; those are the key 
skills at any level that determine if you are a good rogue.  Other 
weapon skills are mostly chrome, and the ones that aren't, dual weild 
double attack type stuff (do rogues get both?) go up very easily in any 
style of play.

Level, though, means higher damage bonus; that means level -does- 
matter.  I can't think of a class where level isn't the most important 
thing, except perhaps a level 59 ranger.

Splendid
