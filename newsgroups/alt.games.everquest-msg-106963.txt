JBoots are not even remotely easy to get, and are expensive if you
just wanna MQ them.

SoW potions are prohibitively expensive until a person is level 20 or
so.

Druids get SoW at level 14, AND they can share that SoW with others.

> Gate - Gate potions, Gate hammer!

Gate potions are, once again, expensive.  The Gate Hammer doesn't work
till 50, and then only if you're an evil class.

Druids get Gate at 14, IIRC.

Expensive for any non twink character.

I'll SoW and Lev up and race you across Timorious Deep.

Also Cloudy Potions, but they're 10pp a pop and don't stack.

I'll remember that next time I see a monk in Thurg /auc'ing 50pp for a
port to CS for a corpse recovery.

FD is better than Harmony, won't argue that.

Snare is almost required for dungeons.  Mobs don't have to run far to
pull an add in dungeons.

You have to spend LOTS of money and/or time to obtain items to make up
for the functionality that a druid gets for not much more than the
price of a couple of spells.
