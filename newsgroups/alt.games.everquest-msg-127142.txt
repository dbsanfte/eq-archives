Heh... you see people AUCTIONING for 100pp... prolly not many sales at that
price. Prexus and AB were both down to 50-70pp before Luclin but after the
shawl quests... a LOT of people suddenly got interested in Tailoring when
the shawls went in... and almost all of them suddenly lost interest when
they found out how tough Tailoring gets after maxxing out on backpacks and
Cured Silks :o)
