 Basically you could, depending on where you cast, get Phinny to the
zone. There is still at least one other way to single pull phinny to the
zone though and unless they disable Call of the Hero that one will
probably remain.

 I think there was a third way as well but I can't quite recall if
that's true or not at the moment.
