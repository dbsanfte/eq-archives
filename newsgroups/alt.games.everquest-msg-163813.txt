I would like to see a mail system with postoffices all around
norrath/luclin/planes.
Where you can write and fetch messages to players. Very easy if you don't
know their email adress. You could even combine this with EQIM.

A slotmachine game where you can double or loose your plats. :)

Able to sort the who list in a zone by class then level. Not sure if this
already can be done.

To save the clip plane level each time to log. It sucks when I log back in
the bazaar that I have the turn back the clip plane level again.
