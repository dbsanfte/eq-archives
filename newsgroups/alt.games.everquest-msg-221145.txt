:So if "shall issue" laws have worked in every state that has them,
:what proof do you offer that they will not work in the other 16?

Apples and Oranges.  Most of the "shall issue" states are large land area,
low-density population states in the western US and the rest are generally
southern US states (with rare exceptions).  The high-density states of the
coasts are where the majority of crime occurs in the US and the areas that,
in general, have the strictest gun-control laws.

You need to compare crime rates before and after loosened restrictions are
passed in each state that has "shall issue" laws.  I would be surprised if
there has ever been any significant chane in the crime rates.

Wash, DC has some of the strictest gun laws in the USA, but guns from
neghboring Virginia are readily available, and with no real internal border
control, there is no way to control movement of guns across the borders.
Does this mean that DC should just roll over and allow guns?  Hardly.
