That's very fast leveling.

Clerics can solo...

...but not like that. What you want is to solo undead that are barely blue. 
If you go the battlecleric route, Dawnfire is a nice weapon for this. 
Otherwise, root nuke rinse repeat.

Who cares what is expected? I usually temp the tank and others can donate 
dots or cash if they want temp. Another thing which will help is getting 
Blessing of Temperance from the LDON camps, which costs 150 AP(IIRC) and 
uses only 2 dots to temp the whole group. The downside is that it uses an 
ASSLOAD of mana- it takes my mana pool to almost half when I have KEI on, 
and I have 255 WIS and a fair amount of +mana items.

Well, theres a number of things you can do to help the cost out. I use a 
Runed Mithril Bracer, which has an effect that sometimes prevents a dot 
from being consumed. This may not be a good idea for you, as it does cost 
some plat. Anoter thing you an do to defray the costs is pick up a pair of 
opal encrusted steins. These add 25 CHA each, and 50 CHA for my Froglok 
cleric (base CHA of 55 or so) makes a 30-40 pp difference per stack of 
dots. The steins paid for themselves on my first stack.
 
Your goals should be gear- concentrate on mana regen / maximization 
(Flowing Thought, Mana Preservation III, Extended Enhancement III), wis and 
mana, and ac and HP. All other stats are optional and should not be a big 
deal one way or the other.
