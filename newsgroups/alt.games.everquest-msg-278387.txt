Considering what they had access to (the client and the data stream) and
what they didn't have access to (anything on Sony's servers), I can't
imagine a way that they could have gone about creating an EQ emulator that
*would* be illegal.

I'm sure we'd hear if Sony had been hacked and the server code stolen.  =)

Interestingly enough, from bits and pieces of info gleaned over the years
regarding the specs of the EQ servers, and from reading up on the EQ
emulator project, it appears the EQ emulator has the potential to be a far
more robust implementation.  I would bet money on it being a far "cleaner"
codebase.
