Just dinged 24 with my Erudite Necro and I've been enjoying the heck out of
this character up until this point.  He's been very powerful for his level and
has not had any problems.  Now, however, when I went to get his new spells I
realized that his new pet is a research only spell.  The pet buff spell,
intensify death, is also research only.  So I go to my trainer and since I
haven't used any of my skill points yet I pump everything in to research and
max my skills for my level.  I then went off in search of the words for these
two spells.  To make a long story short, I've been all over the world trying to
find the words and I can't find any of them.  Now I'm a level 24 nec, with a 20
pet and I'm getting my ass kicked all over the place.  Why the hell would they
make it next to impossible to find the words for this spell.  Why would they
even want to make it a research only spell?  Frustrating.
