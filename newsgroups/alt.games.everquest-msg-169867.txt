Lol..  chinese whispers..  silly rumours.. a GM making a typo in his
announcement ("i have heard bla bla about hacking the server, I can confirm
this IS true", of course he meant "this IS NOT true" but by that point it
was too late, people had already made their screen shots and left the chat.

Slayer was a common surname in my guild (dragonslayer, rotationslayer etc)
so Serverslayer seemed a suitable addition :)
