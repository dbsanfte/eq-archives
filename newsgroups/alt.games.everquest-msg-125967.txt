 A human cleric with nothing on at lvl 50 has more mana then 300, so
that statement while true is misleading. All races regen mana at the
same rate, so in the overall scheme of things the mana pool is really
unimportant, if any cleric runs out ot mana in a fight, baring poor
casting from the cleric, it was a bad pull, to many mobs, or one that
was too tough/tank was not good enough.  In the standard pull one blue
at a time fight, any cleric regardless of wisdom will be able to keep
up, lvl plays an important role in mana regen, this is one reason why I
wont take a cleric in KC below 49.   There is plenty of good ac armor
that has some wisdom, but I would gladely give up 20 wisdom to have a
900 ac at lvl 50.

boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp
no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant
companion of your walks."
