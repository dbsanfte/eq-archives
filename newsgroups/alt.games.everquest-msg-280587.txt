So here's my new plan; I aggro a mob, drag it over to another mob which 
hates it but not me, and get it attacked.  I then kite it around a bit 
if necessary till it starts to fight back.  Then I wait till its down to 
"run away" hp%, and charm it.

The mob it was fighting stops, because its now suddenly a pet and thus 
neutral, but doesn't start fighting me instead, because I'm not KOS to 
it, and the mob it was fighting wasn't my pet at the time.

I run off to one side a bit, away from the "guard" mob, and invis to 
break charm.  Chain the former pet, beat it to death while it stands 
there running in place ("RIP"), boom, practically free exp.

Failures:

1) mob catches up with me and manages to interrupt me enough to stop me 
stopping it from killing me.  Unlikely, but it can happen.

2) We run over an add, and things become more difficult as I try to get 
BOTH off me.  Fortunately, there are usually more "guards" around, and I 
don't have to stay near a fight once I get one started, I can either 
return after ditching, or just give that guy up as a lost cause and 
continue the plan with the new one

3) Charm resists mean the "guard" kills the mob.  This is a pain, but I 
really don't have a lot invested, so its just shrug and go get another

4) Mob kills guard.  See 2); thats ok, I just drag him off for a second 
guard, although I can also help out by chaining and doing song damage to 
the mob.

5) Guard has a swing aimed at the mob which lands in the split second 
after charm does; now the mob which is my pet reacts by hitting him 
back, and the guard suddenly hates me.  Not wanting bad faction with the 
guards, this is a Zone Out event.

6) Mob's regen rate is so high that in between charm and charm break, it 
regens so much that it isn't running anymore but instead comes running 
for me.  Happened in NL a few times, hasn't in GD so far.  Solution, 
charm later, break faster (carrying a flute and having invis song memmed 
helps)

I don't remember using this trick, or reading about it, on my previous 
bard.  I did do something similar involving rooting and atoning, for my 
cleric.

I'm wondering whether its considered an exploit, although frankly its 
less effective than charming one mob and having it attack another as my 
pet; only thing is, with the ED oath restricting me from SOW potions or 
twinky JBoots/TBoots, charming work is much harder, and I think I'm 
actually ending up with more exp per hour doing it this way, even though 
its half the net DPS, and even considering the massive detriment that is 
running to find a new victim and dragging him all the way to the guards.
