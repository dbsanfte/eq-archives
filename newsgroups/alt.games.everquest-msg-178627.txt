Well, I don't know about that.  I haven't been playing Kaev lately, but
I've upgraded a few pieces of his armor and he's looking pretty spiffy
with about six different colors now.  I'm hoping to find some DE racial
legs for a decent price, assuming they're differently colored from the
Heraldic, Brellium, and Full Mithril pieces I've got so far.  I have
found the sole advantage to being a Half Elf:  the variety of racial
armors wearable allows you to make a fashion statement that no other
race can hope match.  :-p
