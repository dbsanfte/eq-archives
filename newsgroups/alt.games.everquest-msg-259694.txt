I wouldnt exactly call it devestating.  Ok when it first happens, its a
wipe. But once you see what goes on... he should die second time for most
people =)

Well the 70 was just a guess really, as you dont seem too impressed with
their wipes to zun, and they obviously have 54 to raid Tacvi.
I mean 54 is overkill for zun!

I didn't ask for excuses =)
"oh.. we were busy, killing umm.. primals, and qvic minis.." is a very weak
excuse =)
Why the heck would M'shas (or even god forbid Txevu!) be main targets, when
Tacvi is surely the main focus.
Do you get in trouble if you dont uphold your side of the rotation, and dont
kill your mobs? =)

Well heck, you do qvic and txevu when Tacvi IS accessable, can't complain
the one day Tacvi is locked out and its not your turn on zun =)

We have a much simpler txevu rotation I think.. basically each guild gets 1
day each (monday us, tuesday them, wednesday us, thursday them) etc.. and
for as long as 1 guild wasn't keyed/flagged, there could be 2 guilds in the
zone (opposite sides/behind locked doors).  E.g we killed Champ first by
several weeks, so when they were trying to kill Champ or minis, we would be
doing HP.  Because we killed HP weeks ahead, we'd be doing Zun Muram while
they did HP or minis etc.

Because Txevu sucks ass, a lot of days theres always a lot of mobs up (only
Zun dies on spawn).. so when the third guild on our server (who sui
infiltrated!) broke into Txevu.. the rotation easily accomodated them.
Basically any day were not in, they can have our minis, or if 1 of us (us
meaning the 2 guilds on the rotation) is in the zone, they can come in and
do stuff on the other side of the zone.  The only restriction is a 2 guild
limit in the zone on any 1 day.  Fuck 180 people lag zones !

Still doesnt compare to the loot from say Inktu'ta (or even the qvic 3 days)
for loot or time invested.
The muramite bp is barely even an upgrade for monks either.. graphic wise
sure, but not stat wise.  And i thought you guys didnt have any monks? =)

Umm the other tanks would just be flung into the corner that your current MT
is in, and only once a minute =)

Nope... you just didnt know the trick =) From who ive spoken to (one of the
first guilds to win).. they have always acted how they do now
