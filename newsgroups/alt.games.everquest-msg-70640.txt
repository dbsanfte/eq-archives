No, it's not being a whiney little bitch to point out how a nerf
impacts gameplay.  It's being a whiney little bitch when people act
like Verant has "done them some grievous injustice".  That's in quotes
because I am referring back to where I said that the first time.  

And, if we're nitpicking, the Fungi Tunic wasn't nerfed.  It has
exactly the same functionality that it always had.  Only difference is
that they took one race/class off the list of useable characters
BEFORE anybody actually had the opportunity to play that race/class
combination.

The only people burned by the change were people who were trying to
get plan on how to play a class BEFORE it went live.  As someone else
pointed out, Verant has said with Kunark, Velious, and Luclin, nothing
was set in stone about the new content until it went live.

I'm veritably giddy about the alternate advancement myself.
