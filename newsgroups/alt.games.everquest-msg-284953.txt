Hi All

I see the gnome on the ground floor of Crescent's Reach has a way to
upgrade the speed of the freebie Roboboar.  His robot sidekick, who
sells Tinkering Supplies (as per Find window) sells some of the stuff,
but not all.

There's 5 levels of speed upgrade, but you can only fit ONE upgrade,
up to now, so don't fit one you will regret later.  Number I Upgrade
is cheap, then they get more expensive... until number V upgrade.  The
Gnome can't get this Number V Upgrade combine to work, so he's selling
it cheap - actually VERY cheap indeed.  It needs, he thinks, some
Magic to get the thing working, and suggests trying an "essence".

Might be fun to figure out and, if the ingredients don't work out too
expensive, maybe a way to get Tinkering skill up with an item people
will pay for.  Fingers crossed.
