Exactly.

But I think it won't work now.  It used to be that /random was performed
locally.  Then the local box told the server what ot rolled, which then
broadcast the message to the area.  When that was the case, I could have a
second copmuter send a false packet in place of a real one that said I
rolled 99 on 1 to 100.

Now the server sends 1, 100 to the server, which does the random and sends
the result back to the PC's making it impossible to fake.
