The American Indians BAH! Its survival of the strongest and they lost.
AMERICA IS THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY and if anyone messes with us we should
oblitherate them. Round the survivors up and kill them. The entire country,
there are no inocent suvilians in war. A little social/racial clensing of
the muslims wouldnt hurt anyone else, who needs those dirty f--ks. Wipe them
out and take the land as ours.

for theirs" -Patton
