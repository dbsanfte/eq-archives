We've been playing from Western Australia (thats about as far from San
Diego as you can get and still be on earth) via 56kModem since July
1999.

Not better or worse than usual lately - just as flakey as always,

There are times when the transpacific ping is higher than usual but my
experience as to cause of major lag in order of frequency is:
1 - Everquest Servers playing up (ie lots of other people in zone
having problems and big lag spikes)
2 - Router/Network Problems in USA (note different pings on the two
major backbones to Everquest) - You could try the EQu program so you
can see which servers have consistently lower ping.
3 - Problems with local ISP - infrequent fortunately

There are plenty of reports of problems with Telstras broardband
services over the last month or two (though mainly the ASDL service) -
perhaps your problem is there.

Or maybe our connection is so slow that we are not picking up the
differences that you note!
