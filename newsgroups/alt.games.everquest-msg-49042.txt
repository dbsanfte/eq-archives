I would second the advice to get the arms and forget the rest. The DoT, even
though it's not the best you have by the time the arms will work, comes in
*really* handy quite often. Mana free damage is always useful. I swap into the
gauntlets for farming; but I wouldn't even think about it on a mob I was going
to get exp off because it might not last long enough. Gauntlets are worth
having if you loot them; but not worth purchasing I don't think.
Right-clickable chloroplast and SLD are nice, sure; but the pieces that cast
those are either rather difficult to get or really expensive. We're talking
about a lvl45 druid who can't afford GEBs yet. . .  By the time he can buy or
loot something like an ES Breastplate, he can get a much better chest. All it
offers, after all, is the clickable effect and good ac. No wis, no other stat
boost, no resists, no nothing, plus it weighs a ton.
