But you do SoW anyone who asks, whether they donate or not, right? I have 
no problem with *accepting* donations. I just find it silly to *require* 
them. KEI and Aego are not nearly as accessible as SoW. It's a low level 
buff not nearly as worthy of compensation. I will donate, sure, but if I 
encounter someone who won't SoW me without a donation, guess what? They 
don't SoW me and someone else nearby does - and *they* are offered a 
donation.
