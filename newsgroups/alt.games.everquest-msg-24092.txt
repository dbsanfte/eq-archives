You have the trivials backwards.  I trivialed on Heady Kiolas back at
46, and have trivialed with fish wine at the aforementioned 62.  I
then trivialed to 68 making Faydwer Port (4 red wine and a cask.)

So, without foraged items, my only hope is the Kiola Nuts.  Too bad
kiolas don't run around the commons.  I could kill them and cut off
their nuts and I wouldn't need the Sisters to do it for me. :-)


Thanks for the information about everything,

Gwinaxath, Shadow Knight
