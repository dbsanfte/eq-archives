I'm going to be trying to get together some friends for pickup groups into
Chardok to possibly get a friend his pipe from there and also do some
scouting for a future Royals raid.

My understanding is that the betrayer (who drops the pipe) has moved from
his original location that was right on the way to the royals. Most of the
guide that I've seen out there have him near the bridgekeeper's house - is
this still his loc? If not, does someone have the loc of him now? What
level/mix group would you say is necessary to drop this guy?
