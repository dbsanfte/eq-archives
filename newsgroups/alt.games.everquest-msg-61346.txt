Because of downtime issues. 

They want more downtime in the game when soloing so you group more.
Haste things are nice but 20 percent or 30 percent haste just doesn't
make a huge difference since everyone is getting the best hast spells
cast on them during raids anyway. Most people with haste melee are not
going to extensively solo with it so it mostly only barely helps on
raids/grouping.

Meanwhile flowing thought or great mana regenerating items will
increase your downtime in soloing so they are exceptionally rare and
hard to get (such as with that horriblly awful shawl quest I refuse to
even try to do) So my answer is no, I don't know of an item any easier
to get than those ;)

They are simply much more stingy with mana regen than anything else.
