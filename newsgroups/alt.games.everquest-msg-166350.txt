I created an Iksar Beastlord alt yesterday, named Bhadguy. When I get him to
20 (which will take a while, since I'm trying to lvl up my main (High Elf
Magician) and my Wood Elf Druid alt atm), I'm going to give him the last
name Mcevilpants.

I mentioned this in guildchat, and someone told me they'd be worried about
me if I named an alt that, unless it was an Ogre!
