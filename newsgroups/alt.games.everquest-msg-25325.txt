I have found that what works best for me, is run, stop, turn slightly count
2 seconds, cast, keep trying to cast until mob is in range.  I have never
had a spell interrupted doing that, well, other than the mob, or some other
mob, smacking me before I finish casting.  I rarely take any damage from the
mob I am kiting, as I run far enough that I have at least those 2 seconds
before he is in range of my spell, and I can get my nuke off before he is in
melee range, and run again.  If it is a fast mob, then I levitate, and take
advantage of the terrain to get him to fall far enough behind.
