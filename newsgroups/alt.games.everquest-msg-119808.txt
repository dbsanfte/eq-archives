I notice everyone saying to press F1, which is fine. But if you are
touch typing and find it easier, you can also hit the tab key. If you
have nothing targeted, it will probably target you. Hitting it
repeatedly will cycle through you and something you targeted. Anyway,
that works also. Just hit tab a couple times till your name is in the
target window.

Or, if you want to be REALLY inefficient about it (*grin*) hit F9 to
change the view to third person and you can click on yourself with the
mouse.
