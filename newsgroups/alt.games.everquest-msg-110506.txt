    Not if you want an exact description of what's going on. My gut instinct
tells me that when you choose to split XP, that 10% of the raw XP is going
to alt XP and 90% of the raw XP is going to regular XP *without some
modifiers being applied*. The modifiers we have to choose from are
zone-specific, class-specific, race-specific, and group size-specific. If
you know the factors for each in a given situation, and grind XP long enough
to avoid rounding those blue line measurements too much, I bet you could
figure out exactly which modifiers aren't being applied.

    When I go below 24 blues into 60 (yup, paranoid cleric), I put 10% into
regular XP. That way no one big pull will be wasted after I cap regular XP
(I've started AoE'ing a fair amount).
