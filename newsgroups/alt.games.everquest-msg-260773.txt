We've been talking about a raid here, not pulling for an experience group.
As I said, if your raid needs a steady stream of singles in order to
maintain its mana levels, they're raiding content well above thier equipment
/ aa / experience level.

Chain pulling for a raid is easy.    Our enchanter / raid leader does a good
amount of our pulling, and I can tell you pretty much for sure that pacify
isn't one of the spells he bothers memorizing.    Pull 3, run back, as soon
as 1 mob in camp is announced pull 3 more, run back, as soon as camp is down
to 1 mob pull 3 more, wash, rinse, repeat.  I could do it myself on my
warrior if I wasn't busy tanking.
