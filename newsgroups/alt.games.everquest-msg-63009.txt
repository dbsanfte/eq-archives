Hmm the Norrath planet rotates with the pole axis exactly perpendicular
to the orbit disc, i.e. no polar tilt like earth has. The moon is a little trickier.
It would be in geostationary orbit but only along a single longitude line, while rotating
around the planet north to south. Meaning that the orbit disc of the moon
exactly matches the rotaion of the planet.
