Not bad. I'm still subscribed to it, but I haven't logged into it
because I've been busy with other things.

They're still balancing classes, if that tells you anything.

If you're into Pirate-type playing, you might want to wait for World of
Pirates (http://www.worldofpirates.com). I'm on the beta now. The
graphics are, well, not-so-great, but the gameplay is really good. I've
had more fun in this game than any of the other MMORPGs I've played. Of
course, I was a big fan of Sid Meier's original Pirates! game, which is
that this is based on.
