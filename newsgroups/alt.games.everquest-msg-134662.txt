Boy did you pick the wrong day to buy EQ!  seriously, try again tomorrow 
and you should get in better.   In the mean time, check out some of the 
sites we use.
First, www.castersrealm.com will have good descriptions of every class 
so you can decide what you wanna be.
Second, eqatlas.com/atlas print out maps especially of the newbie area 
that you have chosen.  Greater Faydark for woodelves, Erudin for 
erudites, Freeport (there are 3 maps for that city, need all 3) and 
Qeynos (2 maps for that town) for human and some halfelves, Kaladim 
-dwarves, umm can't remember rest...I'd also get maps for the zones next 
to the start city while you are at it.  You will get lost, I still get 
lost in new places.
third, everquest.allakhazam.com check out the newbie quests for the race 
you like.

One bit of advice...No matter how much you may like PvP don't go on one 
of the PvP servers right away.  Learn how to play on one of the other 
servers first.  Later when you know how to play better you can just 
start a new character on the PvP server or get your character moved but 
if you do that you lose all your stuff, all you get from move is your 
experience.  Good thing for level 60s, not necessarily good if you are 
low level.  Sometimes better to start over.

If you wanna come on Bertoxx server, I can steer you to some people who 
will be helpful or I can help you out some myself
Good Luck!
