I didn't go far but I doubt it's a difficult route out. As for a solo, 43rd
level, Rogue you'll be ok to move about hide/sneak style but whether you can
solo anything there I couldn't say. I am sure there are mobs for you to
fight but I don't view Rogues as an effective solo class, in fact I place
them lower than Warriors.

There are plenty of mobs to hunt for a group of low to mid 50's and there
were plenty of Greens to us to which would put them under 38th level.

Not sure on pick up groups there, I have always either gone with friends or
with a Druid and Enchanter as bots.
