I have no idea what their HT turnaround time is, but I'm sure it's much less
than 90 minutes.

BTW, don't forget about the DE camp on the south wall.  And of course the
stupid shadowmen on the east wall.  The former is an annoyance for post
people, the latter for a level 24 (or even 30, I think).

LF isn't a good zone to be farting around in.
