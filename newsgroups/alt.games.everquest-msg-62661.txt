DOH! Forget this thread. This ill conceived theory was just shot down by
another propeller head who walked in on the conversation. His take was
that:
1) Highly unlikely such a file exists on the client side.
2) Even if such a file *does* exist, whenever the application was
running, all the files it uses would be considered "open" while it ran.
And you can't copy, erase, write-over, etc. an open file. You'll get a
system error message if you try.

Figured it had to be something simple.
