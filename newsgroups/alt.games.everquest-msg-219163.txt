FWIW, I was thinking more of the people who didn't know how to scribe and
memorize spells, didn't know how to interact with the banker or merchants or
quest npcs, and/or didn't know how to turn on attack.  I've had to on a
number of occasions walk a newbie through these basic actions, albeit not
recently.

I wouldn't say it's perfect, but I did understand most of the basic actions
the first time on because I had run the tutorial.  (Although I initally had
no idea what the "Camp" button was for)  The one thing I think the tutorial
did poorly was that it was linear and once you did the action that the
tutorial was trying to get you to do, it automatically assumed you
understood it and didn't have any further need to mess around with it.
(Especially since it didn't have the randomness that defines some of EQ's
interactions)  It would have been better if you could have scribed more than
one spell, perhaps spells like buffs and heals and seen how those worked in
combat, and maybe a couple more combats just in case you needed more than
the initial interaction to feel comfortable with it.
