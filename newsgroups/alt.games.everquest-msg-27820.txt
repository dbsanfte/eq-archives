Okay, if I remember, I think I did tell him at first that "I'll cast
slow spell on the mob then med and heal while you fight" and, giving
him the benefit of the doubt, perhaps he didn't see my message and
thought I was just sitting there doing nothing.  And I've had partners
give me suggestions often--e.g., I often had the tendency to start
healing too soon and my partner would suggest that I wait till he lost
two bubbles of health before casting healing--and I certainly have no
problem with that and am willing to follow their advice.  But I just
got mad at the way he immediately started jumping down my throat like
I was some dog that was caught chewing on his shoes or something.  If
he had simply said something like "Aren't you going to help fight?  I
was the only one fighting the mob during that fight", then I would
have explained again how I would prefer to slow, heal and med so I
would have plenty of mana.  

Also, I have partnered with necros before and my fighting strategy is
completely different then.  When I've partnered with necros, usually
it will be me and the necro pet meleeing (sometimes the necro also)
while the necro sits back and casts their arsenal of necro
DOTs/lifetap line of spells.  I usually don't have to heal the necro
because he can get his HP back with lifetapping, and I wait till the
end of the fight to heal the pet (if necessary).  That seems to work
out very well.  

I guess I just feel that a monk can do a hell of a lot more damage
than I can while meleeing so it would just be better for me to slow,
med  and heal and make sure I have enough mana for healing.  

That's my two cents worth anyway.
