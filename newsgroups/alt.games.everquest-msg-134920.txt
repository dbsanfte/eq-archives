I'd like that as well. Just having a 'Get Lost' button on the screen is scary, I can
imagine miss-clicking and hitting that button too easy.

I think the interface with the XML language can change
just about anything on the new interface.

I'd also like to assign hot-keys to those petcommand on that window and
leave the main hot-box buttons for other things.
