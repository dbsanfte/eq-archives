I'm a pretty new player to EQ- and I see this a different way.

As I'm playing my lvl 10 rogue and 20 shaman- most of the people i
group with are alt char for people with at least 1 lvl 60-65 char. 
They have passed plat/items from the high level char to the there new
alt.  So the new alt rogue has supper armor and weapons- while I'm
scrounging for everything I can.

I don't see the difference

If I go to IGE and buy plat- I'm exchanging my money for their plat
If you twink your alt char- you are exchanging your time spent on the
org char for plat.  We both end up in the same place.

I'm a free market person- having the game closed like it is is like
the US not recognizing foreign markets- like there is no Euro.  Sure
there will be an immediate inflation in the market- but the market
would balance itself- more items could be made no drop- more quests-
it will be ok.  It is evident that people blur the game and real life-
thus fan faires- and websites- and message boards- and trolls- and how
many other things.  Why not incorporate the two more- the interaction
is the reason I play a MMORPG

that being said- as long as things are as they are- I would NOT by
plat out of game.  I want to have the pride of the first real high
level char- I want to keep figuring out ways to make money.  If you
buy out of game plat and twink your low level char- shame on you.  The
12 plat i gave up for TEMP cost me half of my bank roll- that means
something.
