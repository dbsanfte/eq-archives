> Monk = Level 17 (Feign Death skill)

FD was very unreliable at 17 (and I saved almost ALL training points for
it - I was way ahead of other monks in FD skill too, at the time)

Monks really coming into their own (great pulling, great damage) I would be
tempted to say 45.. but for the lower range, no lower than level 22.

> Shaman = Level 24 (first Canibalize and Regen spells)

Upper levels - 60 (awesome class), 52+, at lower levels hmm (I took a
shortcut with my shaman at low levels)

> BeastLord = Level 15 (Pet buffs to 16 and has first DD process)

> Necromancer = Level 16 (Feign Death Spell)

More like level 6 (whenever they get their first decent snare and fear)

> Druid = Level 14 (SoW, and First DoT)
30+ when kiting is an option

> Enchanter = Level 16 (Breeze and AE Mez)
60; kei and vog :p

> Rogue = Level 10 (Backstab)
55 - double backstab, 60 - assasinate

> ShadowKnight = Level 30 (Feign Death and Self-Invis spells)
hmm

> Wizard = Level 29 (AE Snare)
34

btw you forgot rangers - whatever level they get fear animal, mages, clerics
etc
