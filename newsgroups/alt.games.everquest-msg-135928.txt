Good response, thanks for thinking out your reply.
We really do test everything we can in-house and we do catch a lot of 
"bugs", but you would be surprised at the sneakiness that people have
to figure out exploits.
But if we use your car example ( back to cars hehe) Ok they do test
cars as full as they can nowadays,but they can only test for the
everyday driver or I should say the way the car is sold from the
dealer.
They can never test the car for the guy that buys ones and then goes
straight to a shop and drops it or raises it, thus changing the center
of gravity, then chips it, then puts different tires on it that were
meant for that car. So now all the variables have been changed on said
car. So now they can't account for any thing that happens to you in
that car, thats why they put warning stickers as a last line of
defense on cars.
Now, I'm about to get cheers from all the women players.
If EQ was a women only game it would be perfect. Most exploiters seem
to be men. And I'm talking about female account holders not
characters. It seems women bring real life values to game and tend to 
"play nice" while guys by nature seem to want to " get one over" on
the system. Now, not all guys are thiefs mind you but, records show
that 'Most" people banned from cheating are male account holders.
