I petitioned about it last night claiming I was being harassed. The GM
answered my petition and when I explained they too evetually agreed that it
was a form of unwanted harassment. Maybe it was just coincidence but  for
the rest of the night there where no more anouncements. So I'm claiming
that as one for the player base.
