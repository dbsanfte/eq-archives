I have to say, on mobs I know to be slowable, whenever I've had real
difficulty trying to slow it (ie 3 resists in a row, after debuffs), the
enchanter generally lands it first time after I ask them to (and then mine
lands, go figure heh).

Especially in HoT, something like 8 in 10 mobs I couldn't slow, the chanter
slowed first time (with identical debuffs on it)

But nothing conclusive to present to you, sorry!
