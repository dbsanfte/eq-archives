I thought you needed it to do adventures, guess not.  Go to your 
hometown, and you will get a message that you should talk to some NPC, go 
talk to them, and follow the script, you'll get an adventurers stone.  It 
is an augment that will augment a charm, the more successes you have, the 
more it will augment.  It will also enable you to port between the 
wayfarer camps directly.
