Just because its a convienence doesnt obligate anyone to do anything
for anyone. If a druid was in the group, and the jerk wanted a port
out, should the druid be obligated to do it? Its convienent for the
jerk to get that port (and probably welcome by the rest to get rid of
him), but just because someone can do something doesnt mean they are
obligated to do it.

Im reminded of a time my druid was in FoB and a rather rude low level
iksar demanded I port him because I had the ability. In his eyes, the
very fact that I could port him (and was high level), obligated me to
do it. Of course I didnt do it, and if he had asked like a sane normal
person, im sure I would have done it. If I had ported him, it only
would have encouraged him to continue his rather self centered and
rude behavior. I ended that conversation with a comment about his lack
of social skills and needs to learn how to interact with people.

Unfortunately, these kinds of people will get away with anything they
can. The fact that this is just a game has alot to do with it, but im
sure they are the same way in real life. Refusing to rez them sends a
harsh message. Perhaps what should have been done is to have discussed
this among the group on the correct way to proceed (although diplomacy
seems to be questionable these days). A zero percent rez (as suggested
by someone else in this thread) helps the group to get back into the
swing quickly, yet sends a message to this person, treat others with
respect, and you'll receive the same respect in return. If he gets the
full rez and not repremanded, nothing has changed and he goes about
his normal mode of operation.
