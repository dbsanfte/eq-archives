Find other posts from me where I've given a similar reponse.  Go on, I dare
you.

I've had emails as a result of this NG and cross-server tells from people
asking help/advice, all of which I gladly help.

I help when people cannot find answers elsewhere, or when I can give better
info than what you will read on websites -  NOT when they are too fucking
lazy to look themselves, and readily admit as much themselves.
