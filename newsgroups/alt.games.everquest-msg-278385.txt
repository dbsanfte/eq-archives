I wasn't very clear here.  Running your copy of EQ, and connecting to the 
perfectly legal emulated server is likely breaking the EULA, for what 
that is worth.  So, SoE could ban you from using their servers if you did 
do that.  Beyond that, I don't see any repercussions at all, and don't 
expect it's likely that SoE would ban someone over that either.  
Designing the emulation server is not in any way illegal, depending on 
how they went about doing it anyway.
