  there's nothing scientific in that. just because we mapped genome does
not mean we understand what it means, and the truth is we do not. so,
scientifically, you cannot say much. yes, human beings are very similar
genetically, but not same - which is obvious because races look
differently and that's what's coded in genes, so there are some
differences.

  that, of course, does not mean that one race is somehow better than
another but your statement above is more in the realm of political
correctness then science... it might be true, but as of now we cannot
prove it scientifically.

  human genome project does not say anything about meaning of genomes,
so you cannot say anything about IQ, evil genes etc.

> means that if you say something against one of us, it's true for all of us.

  that doesn't make much sense. if I say that white skin is more prone
to damage from sun does it apply to dark-skinned races as well?

  we are NOT the same (not even people from same race). does not mean
one is better than the other (overall). don't let the politicall
corectness cloud your mind.

  yes.

  one more thought: imo it's very wrong to (even implicitly) tie the
'quality' of race to human rights. I know everybody wants to be the best
but even if some race/group would be found 'worse' it does not mean they
should have any less human rights etc. that's the basic idiocy of racism
- they are trying to prove that some races are worse and use that as an
excuse to oppress them (well, it's one the the basic fallacies, there
are others).
