Well, that's not a good example.  Spell Haste 1 wouldn't work on
spells greater than level 20.  So it should work on Gate but not
on any group ports or any of the Velious Gates.

From the spdat:

Spell Haste I
1:  Increase Spell Haste by 15%
2:  Limit: Max Level(20)
3:  Limit: Spell(Complete Healing excluded)
4:  Limit: Min Casting Time(1.0 sec)

Spell Haste II
1:  Increase Spell Haste by 15%
2:  Limit: Max Level(44)
3:  Limit: Spell(Complete Healing excluded)
4:  Limit: Min Casting Time(2.0 sec)

Spell Haste III
1:  Increase Spell Haste by 15%
2:  Limit: Max Level(60)
3:  Limit: Spell(Complete Healing excluded)
4:  Limit: Min Casting Time(3.0 sec)

No limits on minimal levels, just on maximum levels.  And
CHeal, of course, as well as limiting the nature of the
improvement.  You'll also notice that there's no "chance" of
firing;  it *always* improves the speed.   (Some items do
have a chance of improvement, however, so it's not a rule
that all focus items always work.)

Note that Gate can be cast in ONE second with a Spell Haste I
item and THREE seconds with a Spell Haste III item, so it's
actually useful to have a range of items, assuming the software is
smart enough to use the "appropriate" level.  (And I'm guessing
that it is...)
