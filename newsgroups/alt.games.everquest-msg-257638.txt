As mentioned. Not a good idea in general. A cleric should concentrate
his mana on keeping his MT alive and his Enchanter. If you don't have
crowd control, then its okay to off-tank, that is to grab aggro off a
mob your MT isnt fighting and keep it busy. If you do have crowd
control, then your wizzies, mages, druids, etc shouldn't be getting
hit at all (if they are being trigger happy with their nukes and DoTs)
and neither should any melee DPS (people need to be reminded to fight
the backs of the mob, opposite of the MT...) get hit for an extended
period of time.

Nah, but you'll probably be using the pet-cleric tactic more now or
kiting.
