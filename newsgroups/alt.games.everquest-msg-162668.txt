Bah, we have a 58 SK Er in our guild. He seems to do just fine. It may
only affect your membership in uber guilds who play "by the numbers"
and can only raid with class X,Y,Z. But then I am in a guild with lots
of Necros, druids, SKs and you'd be surprised how creative they have
become to make up for these perceived class "weaknesses". We may
struggle in oh say HoT and other uber high end stuff, but we play to
have fun and are not really serious enough to ever be uber, not to
mention RL stuff keeps us busy; but if it is all about the bling bling
and uberness. Choose the "cookie cutter" SK

Not to mention most of those low numbers are more then made up for by
AA and drops in your 51 plus game. Best part about playing him will be
you won't be one more "cookie cutter" SK, all it requires is a little
more nurturing then most other races.
