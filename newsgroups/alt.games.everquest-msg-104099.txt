My friends at funcom made their own, and i tell you the reason it works so
well...

Funcom people are real computer freaks that know about computers, assembler
and digital electronics, they are not stupid computer newbies that went to
school to learn how to code. These folkz r l33t, and have always been l33t.
This is why Verant sucks cock and Funcom rocks.
