It really wasn't a little glitch.  Tried it a dozen times over several
identicle
mobs, and also got GM confirmation that there are certain mobs which
can't be fooled by FD.

We did try the famous FD pull, where she used throw to pull a mob to me
(moving in her 18 second Selo window) and then FD'd to ditch aggro to me
when mob got close... no dice.  She wasn't being hit or even close to being
hit at the time, and I was certainly close enough to get on the hate list
both from
proximity and the Snare/Slow song I was laying on the target.  Didn't even
glance my way, just went to her apparantly dead body and started pounding.

This worked -just- like a failed FD, except no message, and it happened
without fail on mobs of that sort ("a cyclops") and never on other mobs
in the area (lizardman warrior, grizzly bear)

Our killing ability went way up when she remained standing and swinging
instead of lying there getting beat on
