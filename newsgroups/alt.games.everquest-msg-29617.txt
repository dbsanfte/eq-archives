Yeah, I recall that too, though I also *seem* to recall that the
individual in question didn't merely report the bug - when Verant
didn't react fast enough to suit him, he posted details on the web.

Memory is foggy, so I may well be wrong on that.

I don't believe this was ever their stated position. In fact, I do
recall them making comments to the effect that people who pointed out
such exploits to them would be rewarded. I just don't recall ever
actually seeing it happen.
