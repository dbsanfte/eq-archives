I'm a master at this!

Make sure your enchanter is capable of at least everything to level 50
spells.

Your key spells will be: Berserker Spirit, Feedback (and any other DS
effect), and haste/clarity.

My tactics are generally buff as necessary, have the twink pull as many
as they can and whack them all successfully at least once, and keep
hitting them as the DS works the rest.  Fighting mobs that don't run is
a plus.  This'll work pretty well up until level 20 or so for casters,
and all the way to 50 as fast as I'm sure for melee.  When it comes
down to casters you can root, nuke, and mem blur if you wish.

I've found with my level 65 enchanter with Eldritch Rune and Arcane
Rune powerlevelling my rogue, I'd summon a low level pet, have the
enchanter pull and root and tank with rune/slow and have the rogue
stand behind the mob and melee and backstab it down.

Powerlevelling with an enchanter can be effective, but it's not as
effective as druids are.  The methods I express are generally the same
as with a druid, though, only druids use heals and strong regen spells
with their much greater DS spells.
