So I should post complete bullshit to pander to somebodies ego? I dont think
so.  None of what I said makes monks a bad class.  I said they were fine or
did you just choose to ignore that bit in your effort to display your 'big

I dont have anything to prove or disprove, unlike you it seems.

Every class is outshined by another in some way or another, get a clue
please.
