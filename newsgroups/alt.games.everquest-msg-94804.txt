NO! Don't do this! .opt files have nothing to do with this setting. This is 
set in the eqclient.ini file.

The settings the OP would need to change are:

ChatWinH
ChatWinW

They will appear several times in the file, once for each resolution. The 
OP probably only needs to change it in on resolution. (Unless they changed 
all of the them somehow...)
