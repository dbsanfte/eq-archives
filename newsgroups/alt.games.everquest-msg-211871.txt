OK, at 29 mages get the summon Sword of Runes.  Once upon a time
this item was bugged, and when wielded by pets would proc on any
mob, but now they work as they should and proc only on mobs
flagged as "summoned".  At the same time my latest nuke is
Dismiss Summoned, which also works only on "summoned" mobs.

So you'd think there'd be a huge list of "where to go kill
summoned stuff" out there somewhere no?  I mean, come on, the
pets dual weild now and for a little mana can be equipped with
two DD proccing weapons, plus I can use a slightly smaller but
more mana efficient nuke thats also resisted a lot less than my
normal line; why wouldn't I be eager to find summoned mobs to
beat on?

Here's my list so far:

Shadowed Men (these are in lots of zones, which ones are good at
what level?)
Elementals (are there even any at near level 30? )
Necro pets
Imps

None of the limited notes I've found on this so far say anything
about levels or zones to look for these sorts of mobs in.

I do know there are lots of this sort of mob in Lavastorm (all
green to me I think) and Najena (green again, or deep enough I'd
need a group to get to them) and Steamfont (really green)

Lets see, I recall seeing pet type mobs in Rathe, can I get them
solo?  What level ranges are there of these, and can I make a
camp out of doing several in a cycle, like you can with the
aviaks?

Is this sort of a joke, like cleric anti-undead spell line, where
there are few undead out there to make an actual long term
leveling plan out of (actually the undead situation improved
dramatically with the addition of LOY)?
