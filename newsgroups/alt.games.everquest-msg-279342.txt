But at least its not the same PLACE I've been doing it all along. 

I just spent the last few days camping the Sssra lucid shard for some 
characters in their 50s... it was fun. It wasn't particularly fun 
because I love caves and skeletons that love to add. It was fun because 
it WASN'T giant shiknar in fungus grove (the week before) or funky 
cavemen in maidens eye (some time before that) or ... or ... or 
whatever.

It was fun because had small objectives that took a few days to complete 
and then we moved on to something new. Moving those chars from lucid 
shard camp to lucid shard camp is a lot less tedious than doing LDoNs or 
DoNs day in and day out.

An day or two of ldon's is no more or less than the a given lucid shard 
camp. But when I'm done the lucid shard I can move on, when I'm done the 
ldon/don i'll find I just have more of the exact same LDoNs/DoN to do.
