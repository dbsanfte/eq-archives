Not horrible, no.  Annoying, yes.  You MUST HAVE a rogue to do CoM.  Yeah, I
know, there's a Gravity Flux CoH trick you can try but finding a 55+ mage on
Zeb is as tough as finding a 50+ rogue if your guild doesn't have a half
dozen of them.  And that's assuming you can get the Flux/CoH trick to work.
Last time I tried I came nowhere near close.

Oh yeah, then the task of finding about a dozen people to go that aren't
completely and utterly sick of that zone. :)

Oddly enough, VSR doesn't seem to be a big deal on Zeb.  The person who
needs him does whatever he does to be made sure someone tells him when he's
up...calls all his friends and their friends, meet up in KC and wander over
to VSR & kills him.  Unlike Ragefire at least you don't have to kill fire
giants every 6 hours(?) so it's pretty easy.
