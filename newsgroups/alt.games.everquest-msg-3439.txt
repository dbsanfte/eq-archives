2 things:
    First, you can go all the way to the top with piercing.  I did my
"soulfire-type" quest and achieved the burning rapier.  Nice lil poker and
yes, a piercer.  I'm currently duel-wielding that and a slime-coated.  If
I'm not mistaken, the epic weapon is piercing as well.

    Second, it is my opinion that all melee-classes --even monks-- learn all
of the weapon skills that they can.  It's probably just my play-style (and
again, it is just an opinion) but it's cool to see those skill levels raise.
To me, it's that whole character improvement thing.  Keep one skill maxed
(the primary for your class) and raise the others whenever you have time.
(duel-wielding really helps that.)
    As a nice side-benefit, if someone hands you a weapon --of any kind--
you can pick it right up and use it.
