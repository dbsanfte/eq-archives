Boring is perhaps the wrong word. Uninvolved is perhaps closer to the 
right word. But you are correcct in that CoH and GW are pretty insane. 
But that is what I would expect from a game based on comic 
books/superheroes and one that is referred to, by some I have chatted 
with, as DIII.

One of the things that I am having trouble with is in and out of combat. 
I like to play my characters in a sort of over the shoulder 3rd person 
PoV. However, I find that when I have the camera set like that, it is 
diffucult to click on a corpse to loot it or to click on a mob to attack, 
and I then have to go back to 1st person to do so.

There is more tension in EQ than in GW or CoH. In both of those, you will 
find out very rapidly if you will succeed or are going to get pasted in 
battle. Rare is the battle which is uncertain. I am finding in EQ that 
the length of the battles makes things more uncertain and more nerve-
wracking
