I say obviously, because sometimes I show more confidence than I feel.

If it was a hardware problem, I think they would be more apt to tell
us what's going on. Something beyond their control such as a hardware
melt down, would produce a better PR situation than letting people
twist in the wind.

Hardware can also be replaced much quicker than the ETR they have
given. Or it must be special ordered, and thus would take much longer.
Also I heard that they have special backups for situations where vital
hardware goes down.

FV has special case rules, specifically about No Drop and Trivial Loot
Code, so it is very possible that the code that makes these things
work, or something that would not be an exploit on another server
could be the cause of the issue. Things that would necessitate the
bringing down of the FV server but not others.

The FV server was very laggy last night. I understand when that
happens and the server gets out of sync, Plat dupes are possible. Or
possibly other types of dupes.

Since they brought it down intentionally at 9am (when they started
work) the only thing that fits is an Exploit, nothing else would
necessitate "Emergency Maintenance" without some kind of explanation.

I could be wrong, but confidence in ones self and ones decisions is
good, as long as you don't get proven wrong very often, and I usually
don't.
