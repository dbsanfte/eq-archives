Run for your life!

Naw, seriously, I know some reading material that can help you with some
of the fundamental basics of the game. (Beyond what little you can find
in the manual. Don't even get us started on the manual.) This might make
your EQ life a bit easier and more user friendly. I know it's long, but
if you have a chance to print it out and read it if you get the free
time, I think you'll find it full of really good tips and information on
getting started.

Yeah, that probably wraps, so cut/paste etc.

Good luck.
