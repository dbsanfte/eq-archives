The code for charms shows they can have things whose properties change
depending on outside characteristics.  That could provide a good way to
revive Epics.  Epics are kind of weak for most classes now, compared to
drops from expansions.

Idea: make Epics charmed items.  The effect of the charm is to make the Epic
better than anything else you have.  So, if you are a melee class, for
example, and you get a drop that has a better damage/delay ratio than your
Epic, the charm effect would update your Epic to match or better that other
weapon's damage/delay.

There could also be quests that change what it means to be "better" than
something else.  The basic Epic's charm would keep the Epic better than
anything else you get in the primary state/property of interest to your
class.  You could quest to upgrade your Epic to Epic 2.  Epic 2's charm
would keep Epic 2 better than anything else in some of the secondary
properties also, or would increase the amount of betterness in the primary
property.
