Well, to be fair, the way rotations work on EMarr at least, jumping in like
that can be the only way the get a chance at killing the MOB in question.
Don't get too high and mighty regarding rotations, there are issues there as
well.  The guild I am in is part of an alliance of guilds, and we cannot
break into the rotation according to the rotation rules on Trak, and could
only ever do the pickup slot on VS.  So, would you have a problem with an
alliance of guilds that is actively denied the opportunity to join a
rotation deciding to just take the mob in question when it is up?  Mind you,
I have issues with team manaburn, and the holding of epic drops hostage too.
