precisely.  I gave up 'sini after 3 or 4 casts demonstrated it
wasn't going to land.  I never even tried a magic nuke (stayed
well out of his mana-tap ae and launched FoT's at him).  I know
the other mage gave up 'sinia after about 4 casts demonstrated
it's futility.  The question is: Would the 'chanters nukes have
landed?  Aren't they all MR based?  I'll tell you, made me wish
I'd had 40k earlier that day - Sun Vortex was for sale for the
first time I've ever seen.  That extra efficiency might have
allowed me to make up the damage margin.
