I have played several classes to high level, one of them being a cleric, and
it is sad to see other clerics put this brand on us. If I could get that
last heal off on the warrior and that would save his life, but kill me, then
so be it. That is what a cleric does: Saves lives (and by that I don't mean
yer own bum). Hopefully she'll realise this, and that just because of one
error by a fellow player, she doesn't have to expect to die in any future
encounter.

That said! (Can I rant now? Puuuleeeeeze? Oh, darn, I will anyway!) I am
currently having a blast playing an enchanter. There is something with
controlling mobs, either by doing your bidding or by just stopping them in
their track. I think it is fun, yet demanding on my concentration. (I am
sure my boyfriend would rather have me play a cleric) I am generally good
with mezzing adds, as my duty implies. This takes a lot of mana, atleast at
level 25. At the moment I have a bit of a problem keeping Alacrity, Breeze,
and any other beneficial spells running at once AND mez. I tried to explain
this to this very nice Paladin, who insisted that I haste AND breeze him...
And when he was main puller, he INSISTED on medding for mana... No offense
to any Hybrids, I know you have the mana to use it, but if you're main tank,
I think you should use it sparingly, and just to keep aggro. Not casting all
through the fight, go oom, and then have med breaks, when the wizard, cleric
and enchanter is Fom ;o)

Solitude :o)
