I'm having a problem with installing D-X 8.1.
Whenever I try to open the file I downloaded to install it, it says that either
this package is not compatible with my version of windows (even though it is)
or it just performs an illegal operation.  Anyone had this problem or know what
to do? I really wanna play EQ but can't.

Thanks in advance
