I was playing around with different player made UI's. After a while I
noticed the compass was missing. I loaded the default, did atl+D,
added a secdonday key binding - (hyphen) all to no avail. The only
thing I can guess is one of the new ui's pushed the compass out of the
viewable area. I tried petitioning to get an answer, you can guess
that I never recieved a response. Does anyone have an idea to what I
can do? I have grown rather dependant on it, and would rather not
re-install and re-patch the game if possible.

Thanks,
Bryan.
