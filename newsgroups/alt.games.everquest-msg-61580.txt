Pretty cheap to post on a EQ group, but there is no shadowbane
group. I'm also perfectly happy with EQ and am simply interested
in how they plan to manage certain issues thar are on the zeks
as well. And I suspect some people here have been following the
development of shadowbane.

It looks like shadowbane intends all servers to be PvP. In
addition almost all area's, bar the newbie area and major
towns, will have no obstruction to PvP and PK'ing. A PvP
death will cause some XP gain to the winner, some loss to
the loser. Three items on the fallen go with him, the rest
remain on the body free to be looted.

As far as I can see this looks like a PK's idea of heaven.
Absolutely no way of not being involved in the system and
both XP and item reward for successfully killing a PC. It's
far more aggressive than any of the Zek's.

What I don't understand is how they plan to limit some 
familiar outcomes of such a system.

1) Ganking and Griefing. If a high level character manages to
sneak around happily harvesting low levels, getting some XP 
and items but mostly just for the thrill, what `cost' does
the system place on him? If none or marginal surely this will
be a pretty common hobby?

2) Melee Item Dependancy. Lots of the screenshots have people in
full plate, which I assume is expensive and difficult to acquire.
Apparently the system lets you `bind' three items to your
character. Wouldn't this tend to favor equipment light mages
and snipers over equipment heavy melee types? (it looks like
there's fewer `slots' than in EQ though, about 10-12).

From my understanding this is what happened on the `loot one
item' EQ PvP servers. And while they have `lose your best'
and this is `lose everything but your three best' it seems to
have the exact same problems.

As I said I don't plan on leaving EQ for a long while, and
certainly not for shadowbane until the dynamics and system
have settled down, but this could be an interesting test for
just how desirable `pure' PvP really is.

ps. They also seem to have some system of tying combat into
a `turn based' system so that fast computers, twitch reflexes
and good connections are less important. No idea how that
would work in practice but a good idea.
