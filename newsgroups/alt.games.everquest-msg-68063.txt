Yeah. Once I realized it might actually be him, I tried to cancel the
post, but I've never seen Agent do that correctly and this was no
exception.

Things *were* a lot worse when he was here last time because the
whiners knew he was here and thought they could ramrod their assinine
ideas down his throat by being....well....whiney. To my knowledge,
Verant no longer maintains an official presence here and that's made
the group a lot more usable.
