Another unfortunate side effect is that warrior pets will apparently
/shield a melee they are fighting next to.  This leads to very dead
pets in raid encounters.  At least that's what some of the mages at
MT think happened to their pets.  One moment it's there - the next 
it's gone, and this was before the mob had even AE'd.
