I'm a cleric and though I probably have had more luck assembling
groups as you have, it's sometimes like pulling teeth putting together
an LDoN pickup group.  I generally can put together an all-guildie
group if I try to do so immediately after a raid ends, since at that
time everyone who's not camping for the night is not in mid-dungeon,
etc.

The problem I've had is I'll ask a chanter to group and he asks me if
I'm gtg and I say that no, he's the first person I've asked, and so
he'll tell me to ask when I have a gtg group.  So I'll then ask a
tank, and he'll ask me who do I have and I'll tell him what the
chanter said, and tank usually will come.  Then I start looking for
dps, get them no problem.  Then I tell the chanter I have a group and
he says great he's on his way.  Chanter takes forever to get here, and
in the mean time the tank and the rogue quits because the chanter is
taking too long.  Chanter gets there and sees the tank gone and he
quits.  So I get a shaman instead, and replace the tank etc.  We are
about to go when the Mage decides he needs kei and
runs off to PoK and the bard says he needs to camp to clear his lag,
and never comes back.

Some evenings I feel I'm cursed with groups like that.  Other nights,
I'm stuck with high-level newbies.

I had one incident where in the middle of the adventure, the tank took
a dislike to the rogue (who just wanted the mob placed better so he
could backstab) and camped out in the middle of the adventure.

I also grouped with a beastlord who insisted on following the puller
when he was pulling.  We thought we had him finally listening to
directions, until we got to the npc we were supposed to rescue and he
was in the room with the npc being chased by every mob but one (the
one his pet was tanking).  He proceeded to train our group, causing a
near wipeout. 

 I had one chanter from our server's 'uber'' guild continuously
sarcastically berate almost everyone in the group and took it upon
himself to pull since he didnt' think we were pulling fast enough.
Fine.  Except that the next 3 pulls he pulled everything in  the room,
more than he could mez, and we barely managed to avoid wiping each
time..  Finally he told us that he couldn't understand how he agroed
so many mobs, and it came out that he didn't understand how
pacification worked.  I had to explain it to him.
