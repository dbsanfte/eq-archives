15 hours now. I think  the whole henhouse might be required.

Does anyone else here like to kamikaze low level characters? I got a level 3
iksar monk into veksar and tried to see how deep i could go. I like the
aqugoblin graphics. I was disapointed no-one was in there but kunark is like
that now i guess. It'd be cool if they gave major positive cabilis faction
hits on the goblins, so that getting into that city wouldn't be nigh
impossible without a macro program and 8 bags of bone chips, not to mention
a pet class so that you can get necro faction.

I always liked the idea of turning on my monitor only to find my pet had
maxed out my faction. Pity the druid pet is so feeble. They should give
rangers pets, like a snow bunny or something.
