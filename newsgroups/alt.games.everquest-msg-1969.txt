The only thing I ever hated about twinking was not the twinking, but
when they'd look down on me (pity or scorn) for my low wisdom or brag
excessibly about their own uber stats. Having 50 points more wisdom
than me at lvl 20 doesn't necessarily make you a better druid, bub.
And one of the better warriors I grouped with in my mid teens was
wearing leather armor.
