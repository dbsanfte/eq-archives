I've installed Win2k in my main games machine, and I have connected it to 
the Net through a second box running Linux. As expected, EQ starts up fine, 
but it seems to have a problem downloading data... I get the following 
error:

* ERROR *. A request to send or receive data was disallowed because the 
socket is not connected and (when sending on a datagram socket using a 
sendto call) no address was supplied.

I'm not a complete networking newbie, but all that flew right over my 
head... Is anybody else using EQ through Linux IP Masquerading and came 
across a similar problem? I haven't tested every protocol yet, but at least 
HTTP goes through the Linux gateway really smoothly.

Thanks,
