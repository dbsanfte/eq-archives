Nice round up.                :)

I'm really looking forward to it to (although the extra few days I'll
have to wait will grate - on the bright side, I'll be able to fit some
more RAM, which will make things better, as I've read 1GB is really
needed).

I've also joined a UK based guild, which sounds like it should be fun
(although I never did learn where you go for the City quests).

I fully agree with what you say about the Quests system - no matter
the level, I always hada wide variety of things to be done, so I had a
choice of hunting 3-5 types of creature in a variety of locations,
items to be dropped off, things to be collected.  I never got to try
the cataloging.  With the new Crafting guilds, in retail I'll also
have stuff to be crafted in my quest list.

It's different from the other MMORPGs I've played, where I mostly felt
I was just getting xp in order to level and kill new creatures - in
the EQ2 beta, there was always a sense of purpose to the quests.  And
I liked the dividing of the quests into Heritage, etc.  I finally
managed to complete the first Tome quest (that I got when I read my
"Welcome to Queynos" guide book.  I got a nice chunk of XP, and a new
version of the book, that could be Placed in my room and re-read at my
leasure.  Finally, a REAL use for bookcases !  Previously, I'd only
seen this in Morrowind.  I've also read you can get other displayable
items as rewards for some of the collecting quests.  A glass display
of butterflies ?  Who knows...

I have a feeling I'll be sticking with EQ2 for a good long while.  The
sheer amount of collectable *stuff* will keep me interested, as will
the gradual unlocking of land and new characters.  And there's always
the BAD side to try...     :)

Roll on the 12th (although with luck, it'll arrive on the 11th).

What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
