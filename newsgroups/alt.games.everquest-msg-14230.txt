OK, He's kind of a newbie in that Orlun is a first character.  He has an alt
shammie of low level so between him and the shammie, he has no experience
with casters Pets.  Orlun has heard in game and he has read here, how you
casters love your pets and sometimes grow very attached to them.  So last
night in East Commons, Orlun decided he should go get himself a pet.   Orlun
thinks to himself, "hmmm, a bear would be cool." and runs to find one. Alas,
the bear would not listen to Orlun.  Next he tried a lion, still no good.
Finally, Orlun finds a skelly, Yes! the skelly doesnt ignore Orlun and
starts to follow him around.  Now to train him.  The skelly seems to want to
fight and trys like the dickens to turn on his new master.  Hmmm, even when
Orlun leads him over to bears, lions and spiders, the subborn skelly wont
listen to "sick em!" and keeps on trying to hit his new master.   So Orlun
leads the skelly over by the tunnel and starts to think.  Other players come
to watch as the skelly practices his swipes at Orlun.  They laugh at poor
Orlun when he explains that this is his new pet.

Finally, frustrated, Orlun starts to use Instill Doubt to get rid of the
stubborn and untrainable skelly.  WHAT is this!
"You have become better at Intimidation (55)"   Orlun says "hold it skelly,
maybe you can do some good"  So Orlun and the skelly have a happy evening
training.  The skelly didn't get much better at attack but old Orlun gained
20 skillups in Instill Doubt!  Sure, the skelly would get scared every now
and then and run away, but he'd eventully get brave and come back for more.

Orlun, 31st rogue, (with pet) Xev


P.S.  many other players are jealous of Orlun and his new pet and they would
kill the poor bugger! So Orlun went through many PETS last night!

PPS  - And some people just sit there while auctioning in E.C. (em/
chuckles)
