That's hardly an issue when you raid with six other MGB clerics
and others getting close to it;  not everyone is in a lower-tier
guild.  IMO, it's a fairly safe bet that spell would be a drop
off a higher-level mob and out-of-reach for most clerics.

If it's the spell I'm thinking about, it's got an AE buff icon,
not a heal icon.
