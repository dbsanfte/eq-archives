I've had this happen to my rogue, who was drunk at the time and convinced that
for some reason that was not letting me out the door.  I finally did realize
what hte problem was (the secont time it happened.)

Not really a bug, just poor design, and it won't be changing.

What actually happens is that when Maiden's Voyage zones into Timorous Deep
from Firona Vie, the back half of the boat is outside of the /loc boundary of
Timorous Deep.   The door to that room is exactly on the border of the zone,
when the boat zones in.  If you wait the 5 minutes until Maiden's Voyage
finally begins moving, away from the FV zone in point, you are then able to
exit the room, since the loc's for the back half of the ship are now legal
numbers.

The same thing will happen if you are not inside the cabin.   You cannot walk
back behind where that doorway is, since it is past the edge of the Tim Deep
zone.   Anyways, it's not something I see them fixing any time soon.   Heh,
they still can't get the original boats to stop running into each other every
so often. ; )
