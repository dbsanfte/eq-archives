Some groups spawn with only one of the right type of
mob.

There's a known bug with groups which include pet
casters.   You need to wait until they summon their
pet.   Since each of those groups has a pet caster,
you need to wait a moment until the pet is summoned
before engaging.   That can take a few seconds -- and
sometimes more -- as the caster runs through his buffs.
