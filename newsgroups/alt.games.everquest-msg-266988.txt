Strange newer computer is worse.  I have many features on (spell,
comples sky, etc but no shadow) on my 2.4 Ghz P4 with 256MB fx5600 and
I only lag in crowded zone like PoK.  No lag during fight though.

Is the video driver up to date?  Anyb background task you may not be
aware?  crtl-alt-del and kill any unneeded stuff.

Also there's a possibility the PCi Express is the problem.  It is a
new technology and there's always something wrong initially so you may
be stuck until EQ works around that or until patched driver becomes
available.
