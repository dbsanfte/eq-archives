Tomorrow I could be buying one or the other of these; I'm going to hunt
around a few stores and see what's available elsewhere because the local
computer games store sucks. I'm tempted to buy the first available because i
love both genres (got my champions and D&D side by side).

On the other hand, my machine won't need a new graphics card with CoH
(geforce 4 ti).

On the other other hand (had to borrow a foot) the reason I got stuck with
EQ was that the rules changes seemed to be designed to cripple soloing.
Soloing is pretty important as an option. From what I understand game
designers hate it as they have to work harder, and i suspect any soloing
method in eq2 may be nerfed. I have heard soloing in CoH dies at the higher
levels? But that a blaster is the best class if you are going to solo?

Can anyone who has tried both recommend one over the other in this
situation? I play randomly. I really don't want to experience the soloing
ceiling i found in eq again.
