Quite possible, and that was indeed the fix for me.  I was led to beleive 
by some other folks that it was a problem with the combination of that 
particular chipset, and the particular ram chips used on the memory 
modules.  That would lead me to expect it to be an issue on any MB that 
used the same chipset, not just that indiviual MB in question here, so, 
in that regard, yes, you are right it is likely not limited to that 
specific MB.
