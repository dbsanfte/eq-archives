I am working in France at the moment and now have to stay much longer than
anticipated. I brought my laptop with my from the UK which has EQ installed.
I used to use my laptop at home for night time bazaar trading - and all was
fine. Before I came out here I had noticed EQ would no longer run - but was
not really bothered as I was only here for a week. It would crash to desktop
with the message 'EQ cannot find the file 'poknowledge' in the directory you
are currently running EQ please check and make sure you do not have more
than one directory with everquest installed'. It works fine for my ALT's who
are not in POK but my main is in POK and its the main I want to play.

I would love to fix the problem as I begining to miss it a bit. Not sure if
it thinks I dont have PoP installed or something like that. Any ideas much
appreciated.

TIA
