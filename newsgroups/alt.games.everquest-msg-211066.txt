Amen to that.  When my enchanter was a youngun, I was pissed because I 
*had* started a ranger as my first character and the tracking has spoiled 
me.  I remember when I was first starting out, and a necro asked where I 
was, I told him to track to me /grin.  Likewise, my 64 half elf ranger 
was my first (boy did I screw up her beginning stats), and is still my 
favorite.  For a while I was really enjoying my enchanter, but once I 
finally buckled down and got the XP I needed on my ranger, the joys of 
playing my enchanter seemed faded a bit.

Find gear with good AC and hitpoints regardless of the size of groups you 
play in.  You are pretty much an aggro machine, and whether it's while 
you're waiting for the warrior to taunt that mob you just pulled with 
snare off you, or you're fear kiting and fear breaks early, you *need* to 
be able to take a hit.

"shouldn't" and "won't be" are often two very different things through 
the mid levels.  With no way to drop our aggro and a lot of tanks still 
learning the most effective way to generate/pull aggro off others, be 
prepared to get hit a lot.

Unless the warrior has invested a lot of time and money in his weapons at 
this stage of the game, you will easily out-aggro him.  On the other 
hand, if the warrior does have decent weapons, go nuts.

Bad info here.  I used to be a firm believer in this until a few months 
ago when there was a debate in this group about taunt mechanics.  That 
debate changed my outlook.  The *only* time you should be spamming the 
taunt key is when you *don't* have aggro but want it.  The way taunt 
works is that it makes a check: your taunt skill vs. the difference in 
aggro between you and the highest person on the aggro list.  If 
successful, *bam* you're moved to 1 point above the next-highest person 
on the list.  If it's not, nothing happens.  If the timing is bad, and 
you've just taunted before that person pulls aggro, then the mob gets a 
few combat rounds in on that caster.  If you can taunt right away, you 
have a good chance of pulling the mob back onto you before he can do 
anything at all.

Snare is your best friend for pulling aggro.  Others swear by flame lick 
but I just don't have room in my list for it.  Want to pull aggro in a 
hurry?  Start spamming snare and taunt.  Once you have it, snare again 
for good measure.  If you're both tanking and pulling, snare the mob 
twice on incoming.  People will have to really work to pull the mob off 
your butt.

We are definitely some of the best crowd control in the game, outside of 
enchanters and bards.  Our ability to generate aggro quickly, along with 
snare and root means we're the enchanters' best friends.  It is our job 
to keep the enchanter alive.  This also means we have to be able to take 
some hits, so start looking for AC/HP gear.

> Can't afford arrows?  Pull with flame lick or snare.

Also be prepared to get hit while the tank pulls aggro off you if you're 
pulling with either of those high-aggro spells.

More useful for soloing than grouping IMO (and only because soloing it's 
the only thing you have) :P  Better to figure out why the cleric is 
having trouble keeping up.

> And

Nothing sucks worse than being oom and low on health.  Our bind wounds 
cap is a little low, but only having to heal yourself for half instead of 
the full ammount will cut your downtime considerably when soloing.

Or cure disease.  I didn't even know I got it until like 20 levels later 
:P

We are kings of outdoor pulling ;)

Yes, rangers suck through the mid-levels and it's impossible to find 
groups through the 50s.  But in the end we are the kings of damage and 
utility.  I have zero problems finding groups now.
