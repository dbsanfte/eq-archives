My understanding is that TBoots have a casting duration, and can be
interrupted, JBoots are instantaneous, and can be cast on the run.

I remember running across Norrath in blissful ignorance, using SoW, knowing
that nothing would really be a problem for me.  Then, in North Karana, I
found out the Highland Lions run faster than me with SoW.  I don't recall
what level I was, but he was red to me, I almost made it to the zone too.
Oh Well, it sure did teach me to be careful.
