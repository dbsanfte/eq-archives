Ok,my 65 cleric was somewhat twinked in the sense ,that he didnt earn
most of his equipment by himself,especially the 2 FT2 wristbands for
20k a piece he wouldnt have without sponsoring by my main(Ranger 65
at that time).
The rest came from adventure-points-bought augments,especially the
chest only FT2 augment is a real bargain for only 510 points(+ the
necessary BP from Ldon).
(I know noone is doing Ldon anymore,cause the experience is really
baaad,rofl.Sometimes I wonder what people expect,getting 2 blue bars
for 1 *normal* adventure in the mid fifties looks about right  to me.)
And it is true he couldnt get the FT 1 item from Hollowshade at level
1 without a little outside help.   :)
