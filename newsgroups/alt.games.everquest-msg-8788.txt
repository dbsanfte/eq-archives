The manuals are pretty useless.

Every class in Everquest has so much "specialized" information they need
to learn to play effectively that no one manual could possibly contain
everything you need to know.  It's best to learn by experience, experimentation,
and the mentoring of other people in the game who have been there before you.
That's half the fun, it makes it like a true medieval apprenticeship, where
gaining the knowledge, skill, and reflexes necessary to succeed are just
as important (and a long-term project) as gaining the tools of your trade.

When all else fails, this newsgroup or website forums dedicated to Everquest
in general or your class in particular are invaluable for specific questions.
