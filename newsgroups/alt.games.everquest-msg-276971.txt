Of course, they may be quite competant at playing their class, or they
may not.   My initial gripe was these same-said people tend to look
down upon those who prefer to experience more of the game content at a
more leisurely levelling rate as somehow inferior.

My wife, for example, took a good long time to get her druid up to 51.
An acquaintance of hers started playing about the same time, XP-ground
his way to the level-cap du jour, and would then join other capped
players in deriding players, such as her, who took longer to get to the
cap/never got to the cap as though they were too incompetant to "play
the game right."

XP grinding may not be power-levelling, but I often times see the same
personality in both, particularly once they reach the cap.
