You have to excuse us, I thought (and I assume others did too) that you were
taking the Piss.
Why?
Because Everquest is based around Dungeons and Dragons (table top
Roleplaying game) which was (heavily) inspired by Lord of the Rings.
Because basically any fantasy novellist out there will have been inspired in
some way by Tolkien or his works.
and because Lord of the Rings Trilogy was voted book of the Century.

I am shocked that you haven't heard of it...you're not a GM are you?
