As in so many other comparisons that get brought up in this newsgroup,
this invokes questions of scale, severity, and venue. 

The answer to your question is "of course not". However, let me ask a
similar question...

Would you insist that a new employee your co-worker has just hired be
fired when you discover that it was the same jerk who had cut you off
in traffic two days ago?

I can't argue with that. But I do have to ask if the guild, in
yielding to the fervor of one individual, might not do itself more
harm in taking this action than in just leaving her alone.

>We're not talking about hearsay here, the dumb ass ripped off

Did she rip him off, or did he rip himself off? Personally, I really
think it's the latter. Someone asks out of the blue "Are you a
twink?", a lot of people will say no, regardless of if they are or
not. Sure, she lied - but that should be no surprise. 

Why? Well, what are the reasons a total stranger might ask you if
you're a twink? To dismiss you as not knowing what you're doing, or to
offer you freebies. And frankly, if a total stranger asked me
something like that, I'd be inclined to lie to them because it's
really none of their damn business.

My opinion is that Briann hasn't anywhere near enough evidence to
claim "personality flaw" here. I think he's reacting out of anger
because he believes that he got taken. As I said above - it's no
surprise that she didn't answer him honestly. The surprise is that he
blindly took the word of a total stranger.

That's what my guild does before allowing anyone entrance - some one
already in the guild must have been grouped with them in some
appropriately leveled fights and be able to say "they didn't do
anything mind-bogglingly dumb". And you know what that tells you about
the quality of the person? Not a damn thing.
