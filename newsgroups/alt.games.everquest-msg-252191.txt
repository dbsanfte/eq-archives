Aye, I would have to agree that is was a combo of all the above.

I spent a month waiting for my main to be draggged out from under the HSM
zone, and spent my time harassing the GM's in the system chat :| Which wasnt
too cool.

Well, the original question is, has the bleeding stopped... Well, I would
say the answer is: Well it isnt gushing from the Juglar anymore and the
wounds arent fatal, but we have far far from recovered.
