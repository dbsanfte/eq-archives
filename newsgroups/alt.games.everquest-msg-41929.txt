How does mis-typing your credit card information *one time* equate to
"keep making the same mistakes"?

The only times I miss a point is when the person making the alleged
point is a poor communicator, or is simply wrong.

A) The people involved with repatching are not the same as the people
involved in billing. The two subjects have nothing to do with one
another. This could fit under the "poor communicator" and the "simply
wrong" heading at the same time.

B) You clearly have a pretty limited understanding of the issues
involved in complex software.

Tell you what - you enter numbers all day long without making any
mistakes, *then* complain about someone who did make a mistake.

Without knowing how the system is designed, *I* wouldn't presume to
attempt any conclusions about how someone operating the system should
respond.

>Lazy, incompetent, or stupid?

Count your blessings that in view of the events this week, this is the
most significant sort of thing that you had to suffer through.
