The Surefall Glade one (at least the one I found) is also deep inside
the Glade back where a couple of trainers are on the north side beyond
the Ranger guild house. She may be far enough away to allow someone
who is KOS to Rangers (and/or Druids) to make donations and such, if
that someone can get past the guy who stands at the exit of the
passage into the Glade.
