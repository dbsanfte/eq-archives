kinda pointless to speculate while it is still in beta instead of my greedy
paw . but,

Eq is primarily a level based system . Daoc is supposed to be based on the
rolemaster game . This means that Daoc will be primarily a skill based
system with stats being very important . Each and ever character will be
vastly diffrent from every other character instead of cookie cuter
characters .

Daoc is rumored to not be overly concerned with equipment . Im not sure I
believe this but I certainly believe it will be less concerned than eq is .
(is it possible for equipment to be more important than in eq? well for
tanks at least)

Daoc includes pvp play . No mmorpg has ever sucessfully launched any
meaningfull pvp play . I bet this aspect of it will be screwed 6 ways from
sunday. Im sure they have dont there best , but 200 000 people are soon
gonna try for all they are worth to break it .

Daoc claims smart monster AI . I dont believe a word of it . Any mobs
actions will very quickly be completely understood or completely random . We
are not even close to the computer being able to command 3000 units in any
quasi intelligent way.

There are 3 main areas to play in in daoc . One is wildly more popular than
the other 2 . Some way is going to be required to wedge some people into the
'proper' area . I expect the first great nerf to be of the hiberians :)
