Except that it wasn't.

Tell me, how do you fit into your thesis the "interference in the
world" of the Bali nightclub customers who were cheerfully blown
up by the Islamofacists?  What was *their* foreign policy?

What was the foreign policy of the ancient statues of Buddha which
got demolished by the Taliban?

Work your way through the reading list I gave "Sparkup"; the
real roots of Islamic fundamentalist violence are quite independent
from objections to US foreign policy.  They'd hate us 95% as
much if we built a wall around the US and hid behind it.

Just because "someone is going to get really upset" doesn't mean
it's not the right thing to do.  Hitler was pretty peeved at us,
I hear.

We're well aware of the fact that thugs would like to be left
alone to continue their thuggery.

Unlike your wife, some of us pay attention to current events
and have a good grasp of history.

Holy crap, it took her until *recently* to realize that?

Don't pat yourself on the back too hard.  Whenever I've seen the
BBC grill politicians, it's done in a blindingly biased manner.
"Why aren't you being even more liberal?", sums up too much
of their "hard-hitting" questions.


>CNN and the rest of them tends to keep the news away from the people.

CNN has its own slants.  They started out well, but I stopped
watching them years ago (although I sometimes tune in just to
play "how many seconds will it take them to say something really
biased/stupid").


>Which is a shame as she later realised that if the people of America

Let's not kid ourselves here -- while CNN/ABC/CBS/NBS are
on the level of gradeschool presentations these days (and biased
ones, at that), the foreign press is often simplistically
knee-jerk anti-American.  Don't confuse reflexive criticism for
actual depth.

One every two years isn't a lot, especially when coups can't
happen and succeed without local support.

Screw the UN.  At best, it's been irrelevant for at least
a decade.  At worst, it's a plurality of dictators (single
men, not nations) trying to sway the actions of the
outnumbered democracies.  There's a great quote summing
that up, but I can't lay my hands on it at the moment.
It's on the nature of the old aphorism about having the
foxes guard the henhouse.

Oh, puh-LEAZE...  In that case, I give you the same
reading assignment and homework problem that I gave
Sparkup.  I await your answer, and be sure to show all
your work.

I am... stunned at the obtuseness of that statement.  WW II
was "about pure economics"??  Time to demand a refund on
your tuition, your schools have utterly failed you.

And you say that *AMERICANS* "hadn't a clue what was happening
in the world"?

For damned good reason.

>Option three is about to be undertaken in yours and mine names.

Excuse me while I roll my eyes.  Is *that* the depth of
your analysis?  That we're putting pressure on Saddam to
"look for some oil"?

Is it really your contention that there's a current or looming
shortage of oil, and that we're nefariously planning to
invade Iraq to "look" for some while we're there?

My *GOD*, son...  If that's the sort of thing the BBC is
teaching you, then I submit that they're not doing as much
of a bang-up job as you believe.  Hell, even the senile
CNN manages to cover the myriad of issues which are relevant
to the Iraq situation.
