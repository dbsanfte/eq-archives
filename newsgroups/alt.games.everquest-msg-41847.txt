Actually in the us that is sort of an issue too on donating, not race but where
you have been living.  If you live in any area where aids is epidemic, they
don't want you to donate.  As for gays, they cite that you can carry hiv without
it being detectable for up to 6 months.  They would prefer to be safe than
sorry, though I still think to some extent it is a outdated way of thinking. 
yes anal sex which is one of the forms practiced by homosexuals is more prone to
allow the transmition of hiv, it is not the only form of sexual contact, however
when giving blood, if you have ever had sex with a male homosexual, anyone who
has, or a prostitute since like 1976, you are defered from giving blood.  Sex
with or being an IV drug user will also permanently defer you.  I think you have
to wait a year to be able to donate after a body piercing other than ears or a
tattoo.  While i want a safe blood supply i still think that defering someone
solely on their sexual orientation is wrong.  Straight people get aids too.
