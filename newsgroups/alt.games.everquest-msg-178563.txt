Up until skill level 180, I was getting regular skill ups. since 180,
almost never. I started to keep track, the bait count is 1100 used in a
row with no skill up. Is this normal? I don't have super WIS, but 140 is
not that terrible either.

I also have a movement problem with this alt. It runs noticeably slower
than everything ever since getting stuck between zones at the WC/EC zone
line. You could see the corpse from the WC side, but zoned into EC when
you approached it. Now I outrun nothing, even a guildie who was
encumbered and not buffed in any manner out ran me easily from
Freeport/EC zone line to the West Freeport gate! Weird!!!!
