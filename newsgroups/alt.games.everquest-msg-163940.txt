    KEI is the result of a few things coming together:

(1) High-end raid players were tired of constant rebuffing on raids, and
wanted a spell that would last a while so they weren't just "buff bitches".
(2) Enchanters wanted a combination of their INT/WIS buff, +MANA buff, and
Clarity-line buff so they weren't wasting buff slots and doing constant
rebuffing.
(3) Verant never properly fixed the "I can't cast this spell directly on
you, but if we group I can group buff you" bug.
(4) KEI was made a random drop off top-end mobs in SoL, meaning only top
guilds had access to it at first. But there was a much larger pool of
enchanters, already level 60, that wanted it. So top guilds charged high
prices for it based on demand. How is an enchanter going to make that money
back, given the collapse of the jewel crafting market?

    I don't see any indication that the spell was made to promote or aid
soloing. I think that's the unfortunate side effect.

    The part I think should be changed, if something has to be changed, is
item 3. If it wasn't intended that these buffs could be cast directly on
someone, why should they take hold if they're in a group? Either remove the
restriction entirely or enforce it. But I imagine that would be met with
massive howls of outrage from all the customers of the latest "Manabitch of
the Nexus".
