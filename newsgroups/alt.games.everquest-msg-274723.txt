So then what you are trying to claim is that anything short of criminal
activity is just hunky dory? If you think you can come into my home and
light up a cigarrette without getting a bucket of water thrown at you, you
are sadly mistaken.

Ah, a CONTRACT...well, since that makes exceptions, then perhaps we should
think how it may apply to your time spent in the game...specifically the
parts where Blizzard reserves the right to suspend or ban your account for
any reason whatsoever, and where they spell out appropriate conduct in both
the terms of service, and the language filter which acts to prevent you
from doing what they don't want you to do.

In point of fact, yes you can.

>I cannot just arbitrarily decide to revoke his right
>(of course there are several legitimate reasons for doing so)

A legitimate reason, like bypassing the language filter to shout profanity
in a public forum?

> - and at the

Since I think that talking during a movie should be a death-penalty worthy
offense...yes, I'd accept that.

>or bacause you wear a pro-Bush (or an anti-Bush, for that matter) T-shirt?

All t-shirts are plain black in a movie theatre. I don't care what they
say. in-game parallels are obvious.

> By accepting money, the owner of the

>the rules that apply have, as a necessary consequence, changed.

The owner reserves the right to kick anyone out for any reason. If those
terms are unacceptable to you, don't go there. If you do go there, don't
complain when the owner exercises his rights. Your rights are not more
important than anyone else's.
