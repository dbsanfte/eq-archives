Having waited until the last moment possible out of paranoia, I got up
early this morning and made the upgrade to DX8 on my machine. It went
ok, and I thought I would post the results in case it helps anybody else
going through this now. It was, however, as my favorite comedian Lewis
Black once said, "one of those moments where the right side of your
brain looks at the left side and says, You know... it's dark in here...
and we may die."

The system:
P3 600
Windows 98 SE
DirectX 7.0 (formerly... now 8.1)
512 MB RDRAM
Crappy Matrox Millenium G400 16 MB Video Card. (Apparently my new cards
are now not going to be delivered until today or tomorrow. /rud FedEx.
But I really wanted to make all the required changes one at a time and
test between each step so that I'd know where the problems happened if
anything went south on me.)

Following instructions from Sony, advice here, all printed out, etc. I
first went and downloaded the latest drivers for my video card and
operating system. I was, strangely, unable to find the method in Win98
to upgrade drivers, but Matrox had a snappy little utility wizard to
download that did it, so that went ok. Tested EQ with the new drivers.
No problems. Also tried the test server. Also ok.

Next, I went to microsoft.com and downloaded DirectX 8.1, crossed my
fingers and installed it and restarted. The system seemed slow at first
(even opening and closing folders on the desktop) for some reason, but
later came back up to normal performance. Again, I left my EQclient.ini
file alone at the DX7 setting and logged in to both the regular and test
servers. Still cool.

Then, I went and changed the .ini file settings to DX8 and logged in to
test. (By the way, I did the thorough file check on both sides...
downloaded quite a few files this morning.) I logged back into Test on
my useless test character. The system worked fine. But frankly, I didn't
see any huge improvements in the graphics. I made sure to check out a
campfire with an NPC standing behind it, and saw none of the "black
boxes" that others reported, or NPC's floating above the ground.
Everything looked pretty much normal. If the graphics were significantly
better, I sure couldn't tell standing around in Innothule Swamp next to
the bashers.

Last, I changed the settings in .ini back to DX7 for the time being and
confirmed that I could log back into my regular server. All was well.

Now, just cross your fingers and wait for the servers to come back up
tomorrow and see if we can get back into our beloved lands of Norrath,
or if it will be a storm of bitchposts in here as a half million of us
are locked out.
*sigh*
