Mana regen is capped at 15 worn.  You can increase that to 20 worn by
spending 25 AA (5aa per 1ft).  That 15(20) stacks with all stacking spell
effects, meditation, and the Mental Clarity AA.

HP Regen worn cap is totally independent and much higher than 15 at level
70.  The worn hp regen cap stacks with all stacking spells, aa, etc.
