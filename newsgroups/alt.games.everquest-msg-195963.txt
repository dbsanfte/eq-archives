Well of course it does, if it didn't there would be no question.

But does 5 hp a tic make up for the couple AC and the 50 HP and...
stamina was it?

I decided it certainly did, and picked one up.  Thus far, I'm pretty
impressed, I suppose as I level up it will seem less and less
effective, since it doesn't scale up as I level up.  On the other
hand, neither will the 50HP.
