My mains currently a 29 WElf ranger. Given that the Halflings have better
stats accross the board for Rangers is there any reason to keep him? Or
should I blow him away and start again?

I've not found any decent ranger usable elf only equipment, or anything
Tunare only that would make it interesting.

Is it possible that VI will add anything to the game to redress this issue?

Andy.
