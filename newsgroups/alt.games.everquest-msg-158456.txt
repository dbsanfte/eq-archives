Pff.. How can you say that the sales of PoP is not what sony thought it
would be?
I of got my 2 copies from the US couple of days ago (cos in europe we have
to wait a tad longer..), and many others with me..

Ppl just starting to realize how good that upgrade is, and you already
saying that "sales are low".. hell.. if they are low, it's just cos it has
not started yet..
