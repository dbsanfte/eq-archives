But there in lies some of the problem with some of the quests, they ARE
often tedious camps or impossible to find drops
and it does add a serious frustrationfactor to the game.
Even if you aren't doing the quest "just to have shiny weapon_01" it might
still turn out to be a tedious boredom
and frustrationfilled experience, instead of being a pleasant break from the
everyday kill, kill, kill grind of churning out
little blue bubbles on the XP bar.

I am not saying things should be easy, but some things ARE seriously over
hard, not the least for some of the newbie quests.
And look those quests are meant to spur the interest in doing mre quests for
the new player.. i mean if i was a new player
and had to kill something in the area of 300 giant wood spiders and still
have 0, yes that is ZERO, Giant Woodspider Femurs
to show for my effort. That quest for the moss toe leggings doesn't make me
long for, say my epic quest or such in the future.
