    Whenever I get aggro from something that doesn't kill me in a round, I
DA and stand far away for the entire duration. Was Harmshield an option?

    A mob that Gates can not only bring friends from where he Gated to, but
also heals up to around 25% the moment it Gates. If this was a serious fight
for your guild, having the mob go out of position, summon and kill the MT,
and gain 15% health would likely kill you all.

    Assume you missed a lot of damage, then. If he really had HPs that low,
you would notice his HPs drop in leaps and bounds whenever your wizards
nuked.

    Junk buffs help you when you're starting and need to establish aggro.
They also give slots for insta-clicks to land in. But I wouldn't waste too
much time with them if he blows off buffs that quickly.

    He sounds like a weaker version of Sontalak. Sont is much higher DPS,
but low HPs, and he also blasts buffs off everyone quickly. Actually, he
sounds like a near-exact clone of the original Innoruuk, just with upgraded
HPs.

    Killing big things is cool. Getting neat toys off big things is cool.
Going to a zone and knowing that if you are good enough to beat the
encounter, you WILL get rewarded - that is very cool. Soon enough, you'll
run into all the things that moderate that coolness. ;-)
