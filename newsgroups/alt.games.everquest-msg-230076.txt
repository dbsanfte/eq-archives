I have noticed as I am increasing levels with my bard (now 56) that
Master Looters are the norm.  I think master looting systems work well
when you are grouping with guild members or players that you play with
on a regular basis.  I don't like the master looting system in a pick
up group because I rarely get anything or the split is not fair.  I
remember only two times where the ML system in a pick up group worked
out for me.  Generally, when I join a pick up group where there is a
master looter I don't expect to get anything....and I'm OK with that.

I like rolling for the drops or looting alphabetically for pick up
groups.  Of course, need before greed is always a rule in my groups.
