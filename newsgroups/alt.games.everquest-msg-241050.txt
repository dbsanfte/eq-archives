I started using these and they're fun, but the tells started flooding in
asking me how I was doing it. So I put together this message. Might be
interesting or useful to folks here.

-------------

The following technique can be used to incorporate item links into your
hotkeys, so that  messages can actually contain more information for the
viewer, linkable and unobtrusive, but communicative. Using these links,
players can actually see links to the spells referenced by your messages, so
that they can better understand what you�re actually casting. This
information was pieced together from various sites and experimentation. Most
of the credit goes to Shaman (yay) Gangaskan Gnollbasher on Torv, whose post
on the Crucible site was the first I read on the topic.

Step 1: Make a hotkey and give it a recognizable name, like Linktest. Give
it some kind of /say text like �/say I have SLOWED %t.�

Step 2: In your EQ folder, find the file named
[YourCharacterName]_[ServerName].ini. So, for example, my file was
Winterfury_Firiona.

Step 3: Open the above file in Notepad and find the hotkey you made. You�ll
see the text next to the hotkey that�s labeled by page number, line, etc.
You will be editing this text.

Step 4: Your hotkey will start with some kind of /say or /g, /rs, whatever.
The rest of the text will consist of whatever you would ordinarily put in a
hotkey message, but will include a snazzy new link. The link you will create
consists of four parts: a) an opening �box� character (hex 0x12); b) an item
code; c) a label; and d) a closing �box� character. I�ll explain how to get
an item code and make a �box� character below. But the result should look
something like this:

/g0026915-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001C7442067 MALOS on ---> %t in 4.3
seconds ...

Note the opening /g makes this a group message. Following this is the
required �box� character which denotes the start of the item link, followed
by the item code, the label (� MALOS�), and finally the end �box�, followed
by the rest of the hotkey message. The text that you put between the last
number of the item code and the closing �box� character (in this case
 �MALOS�) is the label and is the pink text that people will see as a link
in the message.

Step 5: Save As � the file and make SURE that you select UTF-8 encoding in
the bottom drop down. This is the format required to be read by EverQuest
and is the only way that this will work.

Step 6: Once the file is saved you�ll need to reload it into EQ either by
restarting or just zoning will do. I test these by standing next to a zone
line, alt-tabbing out to edit in Notepad, then jumping back in and zoning.

Ok how do you get the item codes and how do you make that little box
character?  Every item in EverQuest has an item code and it�s accessible
using a simple technique. Send a ;t to an item, and EQ will return a message
saying it �Can�t find player xxx�� where xxx� is the item code. Simple, huh?
So, typing ;t followed by a link to an item will get you that item�s item
code. It�s just like sending a tell to someone but sending it to an item
instead of a player.

The box is not so simple, I�m not sure how to natively create a hex 0x12
character but fortunately you can just copy and paste it right from this
example above.

That does it. Let me know if you have any questions about this technique or
suggested improvements. I a great variety of responses to these messages in
my groups, ranging from �Ahhh, so THAT�s what Cripple does� to �Wow, your
HAXXORS ROXXORS my BOXXORS�. It�s always neat when a fun technique turns out
to have some nice utility as well.
