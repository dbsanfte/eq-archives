I've traded one for about 6-8k of stuff for my in the last 2 months.  Sold 
another for 5k, gave one to a Guildie who kept me company during some of 
the camps, and sold another yesterday for 4k and a Crystalline Eye.

I pretty much got lucky in the recent sale, as I've seen people not being 
able to sell one for 2.5k recently.  Someone looted one from Varsoon  ( 
Event version, since his regular form never drops it ) and was in EC trying 
to sell it.  They did a PC.  Someone said 9k.  I know it hasn't sold for 9k 
in many many months, so I chime in "I'll sell one for 5k."  I get 2 tells 
asking the stats, so I tell them.  1 of them says "I want one for my twink, 
5k is a little more than I want to spend."  So, I say "I'll go down to 4k, 
but would like a trade, too.  I'm looking for items for my cleric."  They 
reply with "4k and a Crystalline Eye."

4k was enough for me, so I took it.  Then, I looked up the Eye and was 
pleasantly surprised with the stats.  I have a Crystal Webshield, so I will 
save the Eye for when I get higher level and resists are needed, I think.
