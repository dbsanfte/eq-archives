You should let her choose her own.  If she experiences the ones she's
interested in a little bit and reads about them she should be able to pick
the one she wants.  I started playing also to play with my boyfriend.  I
started with a Beastlord which was kind of fun, but decided I wanted a
Chanter instead - now have 1 that is lvl 32 :)  I also have a druid who's
kind of stuck in a lvl 10 slump - I think I need to get PLd out of there to
have some fun with that char.  And I also recently started a cleric to play
with my BFs new bard - that combo seems to do pretty good as a team.
Definetely don't force a char on her though or else she won't enjoy it and
won't want to play.  Personally I found out enough info on the websites to
determine which ones I wanted to try - the book didn't help much.  Let her
know also what abilities all of them will have at the higher lvls - if you
don't like to be bothered, I've learned you either can't be a cleric, druid,
wiz, or chanter or you have to always roleplay :) Maybe let her post and get
some advice herself on what all the classes do and the ups and downs of
particular races . . .
