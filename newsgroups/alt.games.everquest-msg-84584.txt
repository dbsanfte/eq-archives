Been to the website, looked at the screenshots, was impressed.

However, it all just sounds to good to be true. One stupendously huge world,
interaction with everything you see, no spawn points.

This whole thing brings so many insanely cool things with it. Imagine a
guild raid that doesn't stop at the guards, but actually manages to set fire
and destroy parts of Felwith. Imagine orc camps migrating with the seasons.
Imagine actually having to turn up to defend Freeport from a dark elf
attack.

What do you lot think about this game. Can it make good on it's promisses?
