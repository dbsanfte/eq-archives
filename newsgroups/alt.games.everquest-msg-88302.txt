I made a bard and took her to Misty Thicket.  I was playing Selo's and
running along the path, past someone who was fighting a bixie.  Bixies
were indifferent to me.  After the person killed the bixie, I got a
faction hit (against some bixie faction I forget the name) and for
GuardiansoftheVale.  This kind of thing used to happen with my first
character, a necro, where I would get faction hits just being near
someone who was fighting but hadn't noticed this happening for several
months now for some reason  So is this a special property of bard
songs I need to look out for?

Another question on faction.  My cleric was in a group fighting frost
giants.  Even if I healed during battle (and before battle end), I
wouldn't always get faction hits.  It got to where I would cast a low
level stun spell so that I would.  Any reasonable explanation  why
this happened? =)
