Is it just me or has the amount of low life beggers increased dramtically
lately? I have returned from a break of a bout a year and am astonished at
the amount of beggers I have come across. The first few I gave a few plat to
here and there, buffed them even tho their request was bordering on rude -
but now no way, its a freaking joke. Today put me past breaking point, I am
outside Freeport bank wating to do a trade and I had 5 (yes 5!) people, all
at once, begging me for plat, buffs and all my "spare equipment". There
really should be something we can do with these useless idiots. Please dont
get me wrong, if a person needs a SoW for a CR, or similar I will be the
first to help, but its just these unwanted maggots that just beg and plead
for stuff that really shit me. I swear it was not like this a year or so ago
and its pathetic. We should be able to petition them.
