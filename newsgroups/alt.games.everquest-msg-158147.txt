Well I dont loot. I don't like to loot. I am a cleric and I just sit back ,
heal, med and talk. When I need to up grade or when I am running short on
plat  I log on to a web site and pick up 50,000 plat. I always give away 50%
of it. It's no fun having a lot of plat and not giving away a lot of it.
some people think this is not right and they may be right. The key word to
me is "Game". I enjoy EQ. And some times it's not a game.

Cheers
