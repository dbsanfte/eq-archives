I know that wolf form is the only way to surive in lesser fay (other than
brute force, and that requires a lot of force). Tainted brownies are some
crazy level... 50ish, casters and kos to everything non wolf it would seem.

An odd one, is that treform will make you indifferent to the giants in fm.
that is until you kill off your faction with them. When you start hunting
giants there, its a good way to rest up in front of the giant fort.
Eventually u will be kos in treeform too. IIRC the goblins are the same.

Naturally a druid cant get into an evil city because of the religion, so
wolf form wont help there. I wonder tho if you cast wolf form on someone
agnostic if it would help. I doubt if they consider a wolf to be a good
race.
