Listen to everyone piss and moan no matter what you do.  Make constant
adjustments in an attempt to make everyone happy, to find that each
adjustement has now pissed off someone else.  Create a new expansion that
includes something for everyone, only to be accused of a diabolical plot
to....  OMG! sell it.
