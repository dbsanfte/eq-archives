One player dimention.  Many servers.  This is transparent to the
players.

The EQ servers are AFAIC 13 physical boxes each.  Zones are
distributed among 12 of them, and 1 for coordinating things.  When you
look at the IP traffic, you'll notice that you talk to a different IP
address when you zone.

The AO servers uses something similar, i presume. There are different
boxes handling the different zones.  The quest zones are randomized,
and I believe those are delegated to a server when the quest is
created, or when you first enter the quest area.

Experience == the good advice you ignore from others. :-)

Let things settle.  I enjoyed playing the AO beta, and I believe it
will be ok when they have managed to distribute the zones among their
hardware.

They have said that they will delay the storyline for a time, to allow
people (and i suspect: the game) to settle a bit first.
