It *is* sad, and it seems to be the story of my life.  Lately I've been
schooling myself to assume that EQ2 will be horrid, just so I don't get
crushed if it sucks, and it really frustrates me that with so much
interest in a GOOD MMORPG, no one can quite hit the mark.  For me, I'm sad
to say, going back to EQ at this point would be like going back to an
ex-boyfriend.  9 times out of 10 it is just better to move on...

Even if it means you've got nothing. *sniffle*
