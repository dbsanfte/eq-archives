From the shadows, the mysterious 42 <user@example.net> (if that IS his

That is simply incorrect. You're stuck on thinking of time as distinct
and separate from the universe. It is not. Therefore "always existed"
is a meaningless term. Time did not exist before the universe did,
therefore the universe has "always" existed. However it can still have
a beginning.

One can't help but wonder if in your zeal to be "devil's advocate"
(since its apparent you take pride in doing so) you're now trying to
oppose people on very very shaky grounds.
