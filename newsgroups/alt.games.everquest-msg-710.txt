Realize that this is directed to one particular level 13 druid on Xegony
last night.

If you must group, please determine what is is you need to do. If there
happens to be no primary healer, then that makes you one. If we are
fighting, and you burn all your mana shooting off ignite like crazy, and I
end up with 2 hps after the fight, you are doing something wrong. Dont wait
until after the fight to heal me, since I am a bard, I can heal everyone up
during down time. Just sit your happy druid ass down and med.

And please dont try to tell me how to play my bard. Dont tell me I need to
play my heal song during battle and that it will save you mana. My heal song
only heals when it pulses. I am better off playing Anthem for the str
increase and haste increase, as well as bellowing for additional damage.

Thank you,

Sonnet: Level almost 15 bard, Xegony
