Free market =
(1) No barriers to trade: With KEI, barriers to trade exist. Not all
    players have all expansions, creating "geographical" barriers to
    trade; the number of participants is effectively limited by
    limiting entry of new participants in the market (i.e. if you set
    up an extra camp you get hassled).
(2) Information concerning pricing is freely exchanged. Do I need to touch
    this one? Price information is minimal - most chanters are "for
    donations" eliminating meaningful competition. Exchange of price
    information also tends to be minimal. I have no idea what the minimum
    donation that is acceptable to a particular chanter may be. I have
    no idea if chanter 1 is happy with 40 plat where chanter 2 is happy
    with 50.

There are a bunch of other things but it's been years since I did
economics 101.

Of course, the economics 101 view of a free market is pretty bizarre. :-)
Still, if you're going to use economic terms, you should stick to the
economic definitions.

I'm not bitching at the KEI whores. It's not a free market, tough
luck for me. Personally the "standard" price for KEI (50 plat or so on CT)
is more than I want to pay, especially as I usually don't need the extra,
so generally it's something I only bother with when heading into a raid
with no chanters where cleric mana regen is vital.

I have a chanter friend who *bought* KEI but made very little money
on it because the camps were always taken when she was online.
Ergo, barrier to trade. Ergo, not a free market. (And if you want
to say she could have just walked in and set up as a second chanter in
one such location, well technically she could have. But you can bet
she would have caught grief about it, which is just another kind of
barrier.)

You could say that the market has demanded "for donations". Sorry, but
that's just the suppliers reducing the free flow of information in
the market. Ask the players whether they would prefer the chanters to
just *say* the amount they wanted and see how the votes fall out. My
bet is most would prefer a solid price. Then the chanters would be
*competing* against each other... you know... the sort of thing that
happens in a free market rather than an oligopoly.

Anyway, the situation with KEI is not currently a free market.

Neither is the market for Aego/Virtue I suspect... mostly when I
Aego/BoA it's in response to a tell, pretty much the antithesis of
a free flow of information. :-)But then Aego costs more to cast
(both mana and reagents) and typically nets a smaller donation...

I suppose it's possible that we just have different views of what
comprises a free market. The standard definition is highly
unrealistic in a lot of ways, and "real" free markets are almost
vanishingly rare.
