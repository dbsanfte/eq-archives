It has definitely become far better.  The SOE of today is a far cry from the 
old Verant nerfing everything in sight and generally trying to make the game 
more tedious.  Sure, they may still do some dumb things, but in general the 
game has improved a great deal.  It's like an entirely new company is running 
the game.
