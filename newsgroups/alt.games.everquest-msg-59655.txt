Indeed, the way I see it, you go to the frontier looking for a certain type
of game that's different than what you get in the homelands.  Either that,
or you're running to somewhere else to hunt while praying you don't get
killed by some lvl 50.  Kind of like doing the FV run to LoIO....

I hope DAoC does mature and become a good bed of ideas for EQ to steal, and
vice versa.  Personally, I prefer EQ, but I do see DAoC as a viable
competetor.  Now, if they would only get rid of the stupid trivial loot code
and weapon decay (along with all their highly-overwrought anti-twinking
obsession).
