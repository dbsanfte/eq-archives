So I'm finally upgrading so I can actually install the copy of SoL I bought
at release...

Anyway, I've pretty much decided to go with 512 Mb DDR RAM, an Athlon XP
1.73Ghz CPU and a Radeon 9000 Pro 64Mb DDR AGP card.

Question is: which motherboard to stick all this onto?

At the price I'm looking at, the choice seems to be betwen a Gigabyte GA-7VA
(KT400) and an Asus A7V333 (KT333).

Does anybody have either of these boards that they can recommend (or not as
the case may be)?

FYI, I'm shopping from UK so has to be available here. I do most shopping on
dabs.com if that helps.
