Back when I was a regular HG hunter, I learned many things.  First of all,
*anything* is a placeholder except for the Hasten spawn cycle and static
lizards.  Second, there is a limit on how many HGs can be spawned at once,
and also a minimum as well.  I believe it's 2 and 7.  There are never any
less than 2 HGs up (or the next spawns will be HGs until 2 exist) and once
there are 7 HGs up, no more will spawn.  Numbers may be off, but the concept
is a sure thing.  =)

How useful is that info?  Probably not very, but I spent a lot of time there
getting rich and learned all kinds of things.   =)
