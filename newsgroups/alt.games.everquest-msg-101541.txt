Last FBSS I bought was 2k pp and have not seen any go for more than 3k pp lately
and that is a little high and usually the seller is a player that paid 5k pp
before the last expansions. Silver Chitin handwraps can be gotten for 4k pp so
everyone I know would rather save the extra pp for those rather than pay that
much for a FBSS.
