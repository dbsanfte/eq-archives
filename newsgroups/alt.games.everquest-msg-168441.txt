    Yes, if you're in the zone and haven't forced a character save you're
hooped. But camping, and zoning, force character saves. In every case after
I come back I'm at the spot where I camped, whereas others are back where
they were last saved.

    I was worried about that - that my crashing to desktop coming back in
was what was taking down the zone. I did it again last night, but the zone
didn't come down so I feel it isn't me. I've also started to watch my cable
modem's lights. After I camp, there's a brief period where the Send and
Receive lights go berserk. If I try to get back on during that period, I go
to desktop. So now I'm waiting a little bit for the activity to calm down,
then camping back in. Tried that once last night, and it worked like a
charm.

    If you had that line as one of the ten lines in your chat window, then
yes. And a GM can't dispute that /report - he'd have to reimburse the item.
As opposed to, say, helping a guild that killed the dragon trial in HoH last
night and had the planar projection spawn under the freaking world. Glad I
logged on after that had happened, because the people who were on for it
seemed really, really depressed.
