Seems to me an epic you can put in your range slot, so you get the stats 
and effects while wielding whatever the best and latest 
primary/secondary or 2h weapon from the top stuff on the latest 
expansion you can lay your hands on, would be infinitely preferable to a 
weapon which seems great now but will become dated in an expansion or 
two if not sooner.



When I say "if not sooner", take a look at the Berserker epic, which 
many point to as a harbinger of things to come for epic 2.0.  I don't 
know how accurate this assessment is, of course, but I do see that it 
looks better than the other melee class epics... and yet its number 55 
on a list of top DPS weapons for berserkers.  This means if I could keep 
the stats by sticking it in my range slot, I'd get epic benefits and 
have 54 better weapons to pick from, and OOW isn't even out yet!

Comparing this to a rogue epic being a 1hb is... comparable.  Because 
they could equip the relatively crappy DPS thing in their off hand, keep 
using a much better piercer while getting the benefits of the epic.

But the Bow slot would be preferable to that, because it means you can 
use 2 hand weapons and epic, and use two one hand weapons and epic, 
instead of having to sacrifice your offhand slot.

If Bow damage is largely irrelevant, than you won't be sacrificing much 
by putting epic in that slot instead of a "better" bow, unless the 
"better" was in terms of stats/effects, rather than damage/delay type stuff.
