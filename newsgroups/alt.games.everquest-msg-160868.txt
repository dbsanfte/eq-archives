Serp Bracer and Chipped Bone Bracer.  Don't leave home without 'em.
Forget which has which effect, but Affliction Efficiency II and
Extended Affliction II between them give you a 50% increase in
mana efficiency for DoT/Snare/Root casting.  Even if you back that
off a generous 20% of the improvement for truncation effects to a
net of 40% it is simply huge.  It is the same net effect (for those
spells) as a 40% increase in mana pool AND a 40% increase in mana
regen.  So for my 30 Druid, if we assume that I'm sitting half the
time (actually it's usually more than that, depending on how long
the pulls are and how well Root sticks), and we go with 15mana per
tick from a 155 Meditation skill, my average mana regen is 9/tick
(((sit=15+2)+stand=1)/2), so a 40% boost to that is 3.6.  With my
WIS at 135 and a total of about 120 in +mana items I have around
990 mana (((27+2)*30)+120), 140% of 990 is 1386 which would take
around a 200 WIS.  That's the effect for straight Root/DoT killing,
with Snare used for safety, from two items that you can typically
pick up in the bazaar for less than 300pp total (350 to 500 typical
on FV server).

The really sad thing is that Improved Healing, which would be a
much more group-griendly focus, is way rarer and more expensive
(excluding the nearly useless at L29+ Improved Healing I items).
Also, Improved Damage items, which would be ok for a Druid and
great for a Wizard, seem to be similarly rare and expensive.  I
do have a Drakescale Belt (Extended Enhancement II) and a shiny
new Fine Antique Ring (Mana Preservation II) which are quite
nice, but it's the two bracers plus my Moonstone Ring (Extended
Range II, also very cheap to buy) that ensure that when the fight
is over the mobs are down and I'm not.
