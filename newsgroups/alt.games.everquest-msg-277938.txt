You know, you guys are so pessimistic. :P

I understand that it looks like SOE is changing their stance on this
issue. (I say 'looks like' because it's not live YET. Do I doubt that
it will become live? No, not really. OTOH, it wouldn't surprise me if
they *didn't* make it live. But that's neither here nor there.) But,
*at this time*, Station Exchange is only set to go live on EQ2, not
on EQ. *At this time*, SOE does not support nor condone nor facilitate
transferring whole accounts to another person. *At this time* it's
still against the EULA to do that.

If a law is set to change on 1 January, the action will still be illegal 
or legal, as the case may be, on 30 December. As of now, it's against
the EULA to transfer accounts. Whether it will remain against the EULA
is only a matter of speculation at this point.
