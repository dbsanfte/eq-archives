I know this is way off-topic but I just have to ask:

To all you kind folks out there (like Sparkup for example) who think that
our actions in the Middle East are completely unwarranted and motivated by
personal greed...

We won't let the 9/11 attacks go without taking steps to prevent it from
happening again.  So... given that nothing you could ever say will convince
America to bend over and take it, what viable alternatives can you propose
to taking military action to clear out the terrorists and their supporters?
And I'm talking about *viable* alternatives.  Seriously -- I'd love to hear
suggestions... it is possible, I suppose, that there is a solution that the
entire US government and people have yet to come up with, something we're
entirely overlooking.  So if you know what that solution is, then by all
means post here so we can understand the error of our ways.  Don't post here
to say we shouldn't be in Iraq or Afghanistan for this or that reason... I
want to hear an actual solution, not why you think our solution is wrong.
