I am a high lvl Good Enchanter on Sullon Zek and I am tired of always
needing a Sow.  My basic question is what are my alternatives...wait for
horses? Jboots quest (which I heard is very very hard)? I even heard you can
buy Jboots..is that true?  Basically what is best way to speed my slow self
up!  Tia.
