Makes sense. You can't exactly "target" a specific spell... "Cure
disease" and "cure poison" aren't technically dispelling magic but
curing physical ailments caused by magic. Would be stretching
suspension of disbeleif a bit for a spell to dispel magic being able
to pick and choose spells. What, you think the caster would get a list
of spells hovering in front of him to pick from when he casts it? ><
