Don't you mean mid-20's?

When I was hunting in HighKeep basement, there was me(warrior) and a ranger
of the same level as me, Goblin starts beating on me, I laugh at it and
shrug, Goblin starts beating on the ranger, he screams like a little girl
and starts bleeding all over the place.

after a fight with 2 raiders in a party with a druid as main healer, I came
out at 3 bubbles of health, after being beaten on by both goblins half the
fight and one gob the other half, the ranger took the other goblin, he came
out with about 50 hp left, with him noticeably taking more healing than me.
