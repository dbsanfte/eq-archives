You'll run into lots of adds kiting.  I went there at 24 with my druid, and
without the ability to port to Surefall when I was in trouble, my butt
would've been grass many times.  And without the ability to bind myself
right beside the fort, there would've been more than a couple of nasty
corpse runs.

If you're in it for the cash, my advice would be to stick with the
birds/gnolls in SK for now.  Then at about 30 head to Butcher for the crazed
gobs.  Easy pulls, no adds, obscene loot.  I averaged about 80 plat per bank
run there.  In fact, at 37, my druid still goes there and quads them for the
cash from time to time.
