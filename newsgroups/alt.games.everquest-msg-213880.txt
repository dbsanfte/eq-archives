  But sarcasm is fun!

  I dunno... I think that at first when people want to explore the new
dungeons it will be easy to get groups, but later on perhaps not so
much.  Certainly I'm a bit nervous about it, being unguilded and on FV. 
Hopefully Lance and his friend will catch up to Lenny and I, so we can
all go together.  Or maybe some of the new Agers (age =
alt.games.everquest, something that obviously isn't as obvious as I
thought it was) will catch up too... I certainly hope so!  Lenny and I
do tend to level slowly.  We were racing for 44, but now that we are
there we plan to take a bit of time to sight see.

    I wanna check it out, dammit!
