If the gun was stolen and you weren't aware of that... say it was stored 
at your summer cottage and you hadn't been there in 3 months... the 
police aren't going to toss you into slamer over failing to report it.

Additionally, again, afaik, the confiscation occurs because its needed 
as evidence in a crime, its not taken to explicitly penalize the 
registered owner.
