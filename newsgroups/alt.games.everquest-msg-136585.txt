I've noticed that too, but I think what is going on is that if a search 
returns less than a certain number of items, it doesn't display right.  So 
if you get a blank return from a search, one thing to try is scrolling the 
window just a touch, sometimes that makes the invisible items turn up.

}Haven't noticed it yet tho. But what I like to see that the traders are
}alphabatized.

Another feature I stumbled on is that normally, the list defaults to alpha 
order by name of item, but by clicking the headings of the columns, you 
can get reverse alpha by name, order by increasing or decreasing price, or 
alpha/reverse by seller. I usually wanted the default, but it might be 
handy to do it other ways. :)
