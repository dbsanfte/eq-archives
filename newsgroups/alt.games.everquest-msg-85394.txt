Sounds to ME like you're doing just great... I'd be happy to group with you
:o)

Ultravision is MAYBE a luxury buff... but can't hurt to have the puller
actually able to SEE what he's pulling.
And don't worry about Evoke... Enchanter nukes suck, generally... if it
REALLY bothers you, spend some time nuking some greens with Chaotic
Feedback. It's not the target that increases the skill, it's the casting
that provides the success-check to raise skill.
