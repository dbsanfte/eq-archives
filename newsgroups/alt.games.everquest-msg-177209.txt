   I've left groups because of lack of communication.  I figure I
have as much of a right to know what is going on with the loot
and such as they do.  It they can't be bothered to tell me, then
I can't be bothered to group with them.  It's all about common
courtesy.  If they don't have any about something so critical as
communication, I don't care to see what other areas they might be
lacking in.
