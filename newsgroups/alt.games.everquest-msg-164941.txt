Well, I was a little worried that some people REALLY wouldn't appreciate 
the humor (especially stuff like "the incest twins" and "whassisface's 
horny mom") - in the past I've linked some questionable material with 
"please don't click on the link if you don't appreciate sick humor" and 
still gotten shit from several people.  So I figured, hey, let's just 
make sure nobody but you goes :D

Technically, he doesn't. ::eyes candle::

Exactly.  Which is why I figured you'd enjoy this.  I *love* the 
tentacle monster comics.
