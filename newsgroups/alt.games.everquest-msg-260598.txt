Hands down, go to Jaggedpine Forest (enter thru Blackburrow to be right next
to the camp) and kill the Cave Basilisks - they are plentiful, non-kos to
you, and they are not social, and therefore will not add if the one you are
fighting paths by another. The only exception would be the Cave Basilisk
Genitors - they will assist other Basilisks and aggro you if you wander too
close. This camp can easily carry you into the low 40's from where you
are... not sure why it's so underutilized. As an added bonus, the basilisk
genitors also drop basilisk eggs, which can be used to make lots of dough
for tradeskilling or (depending upon server) sell in the Bazaar for 10-20pp
each - and some drop up to 6 at a time!


Hope this helps!
