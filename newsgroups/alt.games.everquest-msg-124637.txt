Since Celestial is -the- way to heal rangers ( we even refer to it
as the "ranger heal, although truth is its probably even better
used on monks ) the ranger is insane to prefer every last one
of his myriad of self buffs to leaving a slot open for celestial.

So make a hotkey that reads "celestial healing for %T" and
use it on him a lot.  When he notices that his HP bar
is still moving south, he might figure things out for himself.

You might also add that rangers aren't supposed to be tanking
anyway, and he can bloody well heal himself if he won't
let you use something efficient to pat his bruises dry with.

Jolt, its not just a cola, its a ranger's way of life
