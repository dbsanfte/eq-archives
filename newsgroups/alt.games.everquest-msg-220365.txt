   Ok.  Lenny can be more than a bit hard to understand (I frequently have to
translate).  But I thought this was clear enough.  He said that if there are no
homes for the offspring of an animal, then that animal should be neutered to
prevent unwanted offspring.  He also made the point that this applies for the
vast majority of cats and dogs, save for the ones that are show and have
papers.  

   The net effect of few unwanted being born is that fewer would be killed.  So
how did you twist this around to mean exactly the opposite?
