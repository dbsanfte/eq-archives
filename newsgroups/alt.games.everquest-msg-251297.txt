In advance --thanks for reading.  

To my mind the essential flaw of EQ at present and  with all these *new*
expansions and *fixes* is that they  universally address  only the  high end,
grouping and raiding game; while totally disenfranchising the soloing player.

While I may, I do not think I am alone in this opinion nor the reality that if
EQ does not soon  address this issue (hopefully with the capability to solo
LdoN dungeons without being slaughtered as the first quick fix) that I and tons
others will bail out to the new MMORG that offers a soloer a fair shake.

Thanks for reading.

David N.
