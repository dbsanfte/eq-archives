Lol...remineds me of these conversations:

"Hi can you help me kill this uber-65+ raid/fabled mob?"

"Maybe, what do you need?"

"Well, one full well rounded group of 65-70ths can do it."

"So what do we have so far?"

"Nobody yet."

"Um... ok... what class are you?"

"Paladin"

"Ok. Are you tanking?"

"I'm only 42nd level. But it would be a huge upgrade for me!"

"Yeah. I bet it would. Well... Good luck with that."

"/ooc anyone want to hunt fabled with me"

(thinking to myself: he really ought to put "Anyone want to hunt fabled 
*FOR* me"...!)
