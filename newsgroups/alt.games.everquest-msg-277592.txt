Is that the icegill boss in the forge area? I've explored a lot of PF but 
stopped spending a lot of time there since getting access to the teleporter 
to SE and working on the Crown and Efreeti Boots. On a lark, we attacked 
Magolemus last night with a "raid force" of 7 adhoc players just to see what 
he was made of and had him down to 20% before he depopped on us. Didn't have 
enough DPS in the group with 2 chanters and 2 healers (what can I say, it 
was a guild group working herigates lol). But we learned that he is 
emminently doable, probably on our next attempt with a real group. The thing 
about Mago is that he has a wicked knockback and he stands out there in 
crevaces-of-lava-city and as you probably know, Hold the Line doesn't 
counter knockback. Knowing this, we pulled him right up to the SE door, put 
our tank's back in the corner and whacked away. Duck soup, but you still 
have to kill him within 15 minutes ...

Amen to that. We have SBD on our calendar for this Friday in fact, it's that 
predictable. You can actually do it in one session, start to finish and plan 
it.
