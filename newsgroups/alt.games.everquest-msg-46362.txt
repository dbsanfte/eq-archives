True, but that only applies if you actually get the kill, like any NPC,
its quite possible to have your LD groupmate help in the fight but
not get the kill.

Some of my fondest memories are in my high 30s, using the
coldain wolves to help me "solo" drakkal dire wolves, and later
Frosties.  Really made me feel like a "coldain with a tan" to
get so much help from one of the rare cleric pets like that.
