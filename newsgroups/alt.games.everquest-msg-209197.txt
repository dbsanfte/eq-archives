HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA

i read through this entire thread yesterday, thinking "yeah, people do suck
at creativitiy"

and i'm sure subconsciously, to make up for all the lame guild names i've
seen, and ones belonging to guilds where people will just send a
/guildinvite without talking to ya, just based on your level.......all that
immaturity and --YES-- the screams of "VANILLA"....well, i must have thought
something malicious subconsciously, and then in the greatest proof of my own
solipsism (*wink*)...

RISING KNIGHTS OF NORRATH IS ON MY SERVER !!!!!!!!! fennin ro!

and i quit eq! i just logged in to buff up my friend and throw him some
gear! the odds of this, the odds! falcon in asteroid field ODDS!

i saw a <Rising Knights of Norrath> tag and thought, 'here's my chance!'

so i asked this gnome mage, "hi, what's the URL to your guild's website?"

mage says, "i don't know, ask the leader, his name is
eaeaeaeaeaeemiiiieieieien" or something (we can trash vanilla names later~)
"ask him"

so i does! <same question>

leader says, "We don't have a website."

--now this thread can die happily !--

and then, a truly classic glimpse into these perfect guilds.......

[Thu Jul 24 03:15:08 2003] You told <of course i snipped the leader's name>,
'can i ask you something, since you're the leader?'
[Thu Jul 24 03:15:16 2003] You told <leader>, 'why did you pick the name you
have for your guild?'
[Thu Jul 24 03:16:17 2003] <leader> tells you, 'I was just elected Leader
today. The name reflects the fact that we help New Player achieve a string
character. '
[Thu Jul 24 03:16:27 2003] Taking a screenshot...
[Thu Jul 24 03:16:34 2003] You told <leader>, 'thanks for the info'


..................

well, who's laughing now? .. . no one, i guess

seems to make sense to me, really

if i sounded sarcastic or as though i had a "I'll show YOU!" kind of
contention at the beginning of this post, it's gone now =p

if anyone can stumble accros the motivations for creating a guild called
"Shadow of the Knight" i'd feel much better
