 Yep. Have to agree here. I still tape a few and watch on the 
weekend mornings. But when I sit down and try to watch primetime
these days I think to myself "what the hell is this crap? Where
did all the GOOD shows go??" Who decided we need 40 hours of
rediculous game and 'reality' shows??" If THAT'S reality... I'm
going back to EQ!
