Now "paying ridiculously well" might get my attention,
thats curiousity provocing.  Since I've happily resed
people for a smile, what would it hurt to come take
care of you?  At least you seem to have a sense of
humor.

If I start seeing a dozen "ridiculously well" calls an day,
then the phrase will rapidly go into my "con artist"
flag box and cease to have the desired effect.
