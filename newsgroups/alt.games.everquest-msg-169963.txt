Being alone and being able to xp off the entry mobs makes it easy.
XP'ing off the entry mobs while watching out for trains from the
castle is more exciting, but pre-Kunark lots of people did it.  Back
in the bad old days trainmakers learned the basics in Blackburrow,
studied more advanced techniques in Unrest, and then discovered that
any moron with a SoW and enough hit points could make a massive train
in Castle Mistmoore, and so they did.  MM trains used to be as much
a commonplace as KC trains are nowadays.
