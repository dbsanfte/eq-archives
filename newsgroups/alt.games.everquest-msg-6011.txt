A-RAM to 256
B-Video card AGP 32meg nvidia ( ok I am tnt biased )
C-CPU
D-Modem

I have 3 machines I use to play. only 2 regularly
1)A Pentium pro 200 with 4 meg 3dfx ( I think its voodoo 1 based ) 256 ram.
Very very choppy video. good for tradeskills traveling some solo fighting
but painful for grouping and fighting all night.

2)P3 running at 450 with 16 meg tnt2 card 256 ram plays great. If lots of
particle display gets machine video lagged but can be configured to overcome
this problem. Kunark well the clipping is down 10% to 50%

3)P3 running at 800 with 32 meg geforce2 256 ram. Video can handle more.
Velious displays better than machine 2. The trees in EW look better. Still
particle display and machine lag in Kunark.

All are connected thru 1 ADSL line. And yes I get as many disconnects as the
next guy.
But on a good internet lag?ping? night its great.
