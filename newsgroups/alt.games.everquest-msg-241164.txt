I don't actually like beer, I just know that these 2 are treated very 
differently. You could make it white milk and chocolate milk for all I 
care=)

Though I do have a friend who brews killer mead=) and I will always go 
for a nice mead over a wine=) I do know he does also brew beers and is 
somewhat of a conniseur of them. he keeps bribing my husband with exotic 
brews to fix his car=)
