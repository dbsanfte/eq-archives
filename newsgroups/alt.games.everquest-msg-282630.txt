False.  Indeed, completely opposite.  I've checked my logs on this,
and EVERY skillup in Defense that I've ever seen came at the same
time that a mob MISSED me.  Similarly, every skillup in Offense came
just as I managed to hit something.  I.e., unlike tradeskills, the
offense/defense skills only go up when they "succeed".

Other melee skills don't seem to follow this rule.  At least, I see
many skillups in, say, Riposte when I wasn't successfully riposting.

That could well be true.  But isn't AGI also covered by Infusion of
the Faithful?

I'm not sure about LB.  I've heard it claimed they can work, though
maybe not as often?

Given the above, it's important not to let defense (or offense) fall too
far behind, because if it's too low it gets hard to find mobs that are DB+
and yet still miss you a bunch.  My advice would be to look for DB caster
mobs (since those don't melee so well) and make them beat on you between
their casts.
