There isn't a single caster in my guild whose primary stat isn't at
least 220+, most are 250+ and a few are at the same level as me
(stupidly high stat and unable to lower it since shit that gives you
+100 mana or +20 vs. all resists also have +20 WIS/INT on it).

Velious mudiflation at it's best.

Baron, Veteran, HiIHaveNoLife, HiIReallyHaveNoLife,
