I assume you mean let him have a 'turn' at looting.  Or do you mean the 
tanks should give up on ever getting any items that keep them alive 
longer because the cleric needs the money for spells?  Sometimes casters 
are just as bad.  There's nothing like inviting a caster into your 
group, getting a huge pull, and while you're in the middle of getting 
beaten, see "Your_caster has looted several plat worth of stuff and the 
majority of coin.  Ha ha."

And before you ask, when I lead a group I either set up alpha looting or 
leave the loot until I'm sure nobody else is going to bother (a couple 
minutes left before it rots or so)
