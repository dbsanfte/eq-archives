A 17" Flat Panel has almost the same viewable as a 19" CRT.
We have a 17" FP running at work, and it plays games perfectly.

EQ, UT2k3, Duke Nukem MP, GTAIII all run flawlessly.

If the cost doesn't bother you, I'd most definatly say to go for
either the 17 or the 18. Larger if you can swing it (who doesn't
want an extra inch, eh? :) but you should be plenty happy with
either.
