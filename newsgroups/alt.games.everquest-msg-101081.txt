Well they should be worried, but hiking the price is not the way to
make them NOT wander off. I know very few people who even see 1 year
as a time they can commit to in EQ right now. You few people are about
it and it amazes me. In spite of the price hike I basically feel that
after playing the game for 3 years and knowing it pretty much
backwards and forwards that I've kind of exhausted it. I did not see
myself playing for another year at $9.89 even. Or maybe even Star Wars
Galaxies will be an amazing pile of suck, so I still will be ;)
