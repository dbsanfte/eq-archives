As a cleric, I do like to know when a mob has been slowed.  Depending on the
mob it may change my healing substantially.  Also, it's good to know the a
mob has been debuffed or magic resist dropped for obvious reasons.

As for the wizard saying his dd spell, well I'd like to know that as well
just to know that he's actually doing something :)  Frankly, I find people
still don't use enough of these functions.

IMHO all of these are quite welcome and required.
