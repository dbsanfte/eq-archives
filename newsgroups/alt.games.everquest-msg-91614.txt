Every single mob you kill means others can't kill it. It's just a
question of degree, and your blanket statement is clearly ridiculous.
KIlling Tormax means every last person on the server has to wait a week
for another chance. Killing Lodizal means they have to wait a multiple
of 20 hours for another chance. Killing an orc pawn means they have to
wait for respawn.

There are more than enough things to kill if you're of the level where
you can kill Ventani. Complaining he isn't there if you AREN'T of a
level to kill the warders is, to steal an apt word, boohooism.

PNP in the high level game is the most ridiculously abused and misused
'tactic' I've ever seen. Get to the mob with enough people and kill it.
If someone else shows up and gets enough before you, they kill it. 

eg: One guild setting up for a mob with barely enough to kill it, but
enough to have a go once a couple en-route arrive. 1 person from another
guild zones in, then 10 more, and another 10 from an allied guild. This
second raid CoHes to between the first guild and the mob, and stall the
whole thing. GM is called and forces them to roll or alternate mobs in
the zone or something. Then the 2 allied guilds demand separate rights,
effectively giving them 2/3 of the kills. The 'allies' then spend 5
hours failing one of the mobs before leaving, the first guild comes back
in and kills that and everything else first time.

Shit, or get off the freakin' pot.

If you need to call an 'adult' every time you can't sort out a conflict,
you're clearly too immature to be commenting on ethics
