That is congruent with what I have been revealed as well, with many of =
the same metaphors and ideas involved but the elemental order seems =
inaccurate although you mentioned how the ages ended. The order of =
elements in importance during this new age will be likely either be =
fire, air, earth and water or fire, earth, air and water but water will =
be the last and fire shall be the first which is not how it was in the =
last age where merchant kings ruled above the world in iron towers made =
of glass.=20

=20

Here are the 3 creations

=20

1st - Garden of Eden

2nd - Old Testament

3rd - New Testament

4th - ??=20

5th - ??

=20

=20

The Change won't be a shitload of buffalo stampeding out of a hole in =
the
ground. It will be chaos followed by true holocaust in which the first 6 =
of the
things that end creations will all play, but mostly this time it will be =
the
fires.  And those who aren't where they are meant to be won't make it =
through
them, no matter how many billions of dollars they have access to.

This is part of what I learned about The Change in the Creations.  And =
it has
always happened so, I was told.  This IS the 4th Creation, if I have =
been
taught properly, and each time it started with chaos which only prepared =
the
world for the holocaust to come.  The first ended by earth, the second =
by wind,
the third by water and this one will end by fire...

Which is the whole idea!  I know you are half joking here, but I was =
taught
that we choose a road at some point in our lives and that in the old =
days, this
choice was made very early.  If we walk a right road, we take =
responsibility
for what we do and we make amends when we hurt someone without having to =
be forced to do it.  If we choose a wrong road, we follow the ways of =
The Wild One
and in the end, we will spend eternity living as we lived in life.  Now, =
that
might not sound too bad for someone who wants to lie, cheat and steal, =
but you
have to stop and realize that since this takes place in The Wild One's =
part of
the "Forever Land", the people who you are doing this too are also there =
for
the same reasons doing it to you.
