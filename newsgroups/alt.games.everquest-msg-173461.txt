Egress has, IIRC, a five second cast time.  And if you're a druid,
it's EASY to put that much room between you and what you're hunting.
Or at least enough room to drop snare what ever adds you have and then
you got all the space in the world to run off and hit Egress.

>Egress also takes a spell slot, while zoning out doesn't.

My spells look like this when I'm hunting in the planes:

-Wildfire
-Breath of Karana/Call of Karana, depending on whether I'm charm
killing or Root&Rot.
-Harmony of Nature
-Winged Death
-Ensnare 
-Engulfing Roots
-Chloroblast/Rotating Buff Slot
-Egress

If I'm charm killing, Wildfire (1024 point nuke) goes unused, so
sometimes I'll switch Glamor of Tunare in there just for shits and
giggles.  Harmony of Nature is only up because I prefer killing the
trees in PoN because they drop the pages for the cloak quest, so I'll
pull a tree in a tight place rather than go find something easier to
pull.  In all honesty I could make due without it though.

I got Egress on my number 10 hotkey so if I can get out in a mondo
hurry.

So, the extra spell slot of Egress is really a non-issue.

Now, pre-PoP, I'd be inclined to agree with you.  But now with the
Graveyards being right at the zone-in, you tend to have people there
looting corpses and waiting on rezes and the like.  Makes training the
zone really, REALLY a hassle for many, and an understandable gripe.
Sometimes it can't be helped, but at least have the good decency to
shout that you're bringing a train, and just as importantly, where the
fuck you're bringing it from.

Hell yeah.  Only downside is that it drops Wolfform.

This is true, but I was speaking primarily of druids though.

Pestilence rats are about the same level as ravens and, if memory
serves, hit a little bit harder.
