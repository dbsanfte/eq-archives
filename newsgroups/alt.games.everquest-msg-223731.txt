Those sites have popups? I've been spoiled by Mozilla :)

Not at all. I expect EQ to coexist with other legitimate applications. 
If I'm running gator, kazaa, offer companion, and have my bonzi buddi 
loaded and that causes eq to crash I would expect SOE to tell me that 
they do not support running alongside spyware like the above.

At most I want SOE to test it to confirm that there is an issue if one 
is reported, and to verify that the fault is not within their own 
software. And finally to put a note of this incompatibility on their 
support site. Once that's been established I'm satisfied that they are 
done. *Provided its not a fault in SOEs code*

I distribute software also, to a less controlled environment than you. 
But if someone were to report a conflict, and I determined that it 
conflicted with gator, and that it was because gator was not behaving 
properly then I would have no qualms about telling them to remove gator.

I'll grant that some of these issues were unforeseeable.

Ironically your two examples... linksys routers and amd cpus should 
reasonably have been within their test suite. An effort this size should 
at least sport a couple machines from each cpu vendor (amd/intel), and 
each major graphics vendor (ati, nvidia), and each major sound chipset, 
not to mention the typical network topologies (direct connect, lans with 
routers smc, dlink, linksys, and of course dialup)

Give me 1 hour, and the test lab I'd devised would have covered these 
bases, even without foreknowledge of the problems that did occur.

Granted there is hardware that I would miss, and some of it (see below) 
I wouldn't even consider 'negligent'. I already asserted that I accept 
that sort of fault, and we appear to agree on that.

Overclocked AMDs for example, I wouldn't include in the test suite, 
necessarily. Thats users at their own peril as far as im concerned. If a 
bug crops up there I'd definately look into it, but I wouldn't 
necessarily include it in the normal test suite.
