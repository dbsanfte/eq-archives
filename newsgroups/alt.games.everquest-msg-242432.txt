Ack, ok, let's see if I can remember it at work.  AMD Athlon XP 1.9
processor overclocked to somewhere in the 2.5 range.  NVIDEA motherboard,
I *don't* remember the details on that I fear.  GeForce4 TI 4200 with 32MB
Ram.  1024 Gig of some fancy-sounding RAM (dual-channel? SD? can't
remember).

Do you need me to find out the particulars on the motherboard and RAM, or
do you have enough there to go on?
