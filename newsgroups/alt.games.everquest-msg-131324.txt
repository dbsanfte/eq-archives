remembers the huge ass post here from whiney druids that wanted cheal

I don't hate druids... I just think theres very few good druids.

Maybe theres the same number of good druids as good ____, druids are an easy
classs to play though.. so they have more than the average number of
incompetent 'dr00ds' playing them at higher levels.
