You mean when they're kind of hanging in the air in a half-sitting position
with their toes touching the ground and they just sit there twitching?  It's
a known game bug, and the wierd thing is that only some players see it.
There have been times when one person in my group commented on seeing it,
and to everyone else the player in question looked entirely normal.  It only
happens when a player is sitting down.
