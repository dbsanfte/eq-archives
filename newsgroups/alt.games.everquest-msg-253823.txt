I have read this as well, and I've timed my attacks accordingly, so that no
button was greyed out at both the start and the end of the intimidate.  I
have still seen all of two successful intimidates since I got the skill.  My
BER is level 35 and the intimidate skill has not gone up past 20 or so.  I
guess my point is, it may be true that using another skill will interrupt
it, but it still isn't very reliable even if you don't use other skills, at
least at a low skill level.

It's the same "you aren't scaring anyone" message whether you use another
attack during the intimidate timer or not.

From what I have read, it's the button being greyed out that causes the
failure.  I don't really know, as my actual experience with the skill is
much like yours, at a very low skill level with very, very few successes.
