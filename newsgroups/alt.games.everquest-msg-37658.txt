No.  There is no haste component on Wu's.

Was he using a weapon while you were using bare fists?

At your levels, the damage/delay on your fists is 7/36.  At higher levels,
humans get slightly faster delay, but not much.

I'd say he either had a haste buff or item, or was using a faster weapon
than his fists.
