Well for some reason, they made it so
/who all guild
returned people who's names started with guild (one guy on MT is named
Guildersleeves)

while
/who all GUILD
returned the people who were on in your character's guild.

Actually I've only reached the final mob a couple times, but him not slowing
properly was probably responsible for my wipes when we did get to him.  He hits
insanely hard and fast, getting him slowed is crucial... and finding out later
that the slows we were using had no effect at all but a low level slow would
have worked is just annoying.

Yep, thats a major challenge.  I so very much wish the majority of my guild had
PoP, so I could get a reliable well oiled group together to do this, instead of
having to deal with random motley hordes who just can't quite make it 16 times
in a row.

Well, I"ve seen him 3 times, and wiped to him every time.  He doesnt seem
unbeatable (got him to 30% at one point) but not utterly gimp either, not with
level 61ish people anyway, and not unslowed... which apparantly he was, whether
we got that "good slow" stuck or not.

Of course that was also when I was still using heals to get thru the fights,
instead of using CE to the virtual exclusion of all other heals; I was pretty
LOM and more than a bit beat up by the time we got to him.  Now I've come into
the fourth wave still almost FM (eating mod rod charges, KEI, PoTG, SP all on)
and its just one thing or another making us a second or two late on one of the
mobs that stops us.
