I can understand trying to get a port from FV to qeynos, but i don't
understand just sitting there and hoping for a port.  If I was stuck with
such a problem, I'd shout a few times in FV and LOIO then I'd hop on the
boat to BB and shout a few times when I arrived there, go in Gfay and see if
anyone is hanging out there that can port me, if you have luclin you can the
short cut to NK from Gfay by taking the spires up. Alternatively, take the
boat from BB to FP and shout in FP a few time (all the zones not just WFP)
and just generally keep running till I either got a port or I got across the
country.  Staying in one zone for 2 hours shouting is annoying to people who
can't help you (like me) and just plain not fun. I get bored so easily, I
hate even sitting on the boats but I do it cuz it really is faster than
sitting there shouting for a port all day.
