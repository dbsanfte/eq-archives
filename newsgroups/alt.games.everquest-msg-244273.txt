Aye, an unfortunate sideffect of those. :(

Got it in one. ;)  They are also drastically reduced in size from the
original.  There is too much artwork theft going on to even risk it,
especially since many of those drawings were for friends or clients who
would also be bummed if they found their character being used in someone
else's sig.

Not that my artwork is so fabulous that I expect folks will come from all
around to steal it, but folks who like to "borrow" artwork oddly enough
don't always have the best *taste*. :P

Only for pieces that are already used without a watermark, like the guild
picture.
