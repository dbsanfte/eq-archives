Man, it is so obvious you don't play your monk much anymore.  Either that,
or your monk is *so* insanely equipped that you think they still tank as
good as...  well, anybody.

My monk is a 6k+ monk (finally) with 1300+ AC.  Only slightly joking because
I don't have the ability to test it, but I think if my magician (sub-700 AC)
had 6k hp, my magician could tank as well as my monk.  :)

So, for the original poster of this thread, take it from a well-equipped
monk (though obviously *far* below what "m" must be), monks can't tank for
crap anymore and are *never* a better choice than a plate class tank for
taking damage.
