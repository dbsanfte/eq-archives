Its the same game. A couple small things changed but overall its
getting better. I'm a druid and realize that a non resistable method
to pull uber mobs was kind of ridiculous. That is just an example of
an overall improvement; they are putting in a spell that can be
resisted but will work in places it did not before, like cazic.

Most changes of late to the game are very good. Certain affected
classes just dwell on anything bad. As has been said, Verant
themselves all play various high level characters just like us. Any
real bad changes will at some point be rebalanced.
