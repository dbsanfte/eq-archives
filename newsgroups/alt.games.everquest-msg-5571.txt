 Except you are not really anonymous are you? Even with anonymous remailers
your identity and ISP can be determined if it were important to find it out.
 
 Do you believe that you can go into a real world place and start abusing
people without consequences? If so you are in trouble. Same thing goes here
sir. When a person becomes abusive there may be consequences. Zeppo recieved
his consequences.
