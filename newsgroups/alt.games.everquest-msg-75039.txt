I've never seen a ring war in GD.  So, when i found one about to start
last night I decided to stay and help out.  Third wave of giants
somehow got past everyone and into the tunnel to Thurgadin.  Lag was
exceptionally bad which accounted for my getting right in between to
giants before I realized they were there.  

Anyway it got ugly!  I went back over my log and had to laugh.  Death
to my character is just a distraction I guess.

[Thu Jan 03 00:29:43 2002] You have been slain by Kromrif Elite Guard!
[Thu Jan 03 00:29:44 2002] You are too distracted to cast a spell now!

Time to find a rez!
