My main problem with this suggestion is that if lots of people do it I won't
be able to get in game due to the congestion.  My EQ folder is 916GB AFTER
deleting all screen shots and log file larger than 350kb.  Even on cable
modem with no congestion we're talking about a serious amount of bandwidth
if folks started doing this regularly.
