Cyrstal Caves is a one-way zone.  I believe you can Gate out, but once you
go in, the only way out that I know of is to jump down the pit, run through
the Frostone dwarf outpost, through the Terror/spider hall, and up the
Geonid tunnel.  Fortunately, the Dwarves and the Geonids are harmless
unless you've attacked them at some point.  Unfortunately, the Terrors and
spiders are nuts and seem to attack just about anything.  And of course,
there's the fact that if you jump just right and manage to miss all the
walkways crossing the pit, you'll spalt into the bottom for a thousand
points or more without lev, not to mention that you just aggro'd every
Ry'gorr in the place on the way down without invis.  : )
