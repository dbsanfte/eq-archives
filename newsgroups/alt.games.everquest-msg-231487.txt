Hi Bizbee

Hehe! Well your half right. I do like a good moan <grin>

I've always thought power levelling was cheating done up in political 
spin. Like we invaded Iraq because of WMD (Nothing to do with the 
possibility of losing Saudi oil!)

Though the I will be the first to admit. I'll use high level buff when I 
get one given to me and I like petrol in my car at prices that don't 
require me to mortgage my home.

What irks me is arriving in a zone to find it empty or full of corpses 
when I only have an hour or so to play. As most of the players who seem 
to do this type of mass destruction don't like to share and moan if you 
start trying to kill for experience and loot. So I have to waste time 
trying to find another area to play in.

What galls me more is a high level character waltzing by with a train of 
most of the grimlings in zone in tow and the one I was fighting goes off 
and joins them. When I try to root it. I get accused of kill stealing! I 
had got it down to 40%, when it left and it had my warder in tow??
Personally I think it just ran in the same direction the guy was heading 
in as my snare had worn off. But who am I to disagree with a level 65 
'Time' flagged player as he described himself.

/Crawls back under his rock to moan and mumble to himself some more.
