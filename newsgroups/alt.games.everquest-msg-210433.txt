I'm willing to bet it's a firewall problem.  I believe that where you click that connect button is the exact point where eq.exe will require server permissions.  Are you running XP on the mediocre machine?  If not then it seems even more likely.

My advice would be to disable the built-in XP firewall (it's bloody useless) and download ZoneAlarm and use that.  (www.zonelabs.com IIRC)

You may want to be in windowed mode when you first run EQ, since you will get a notification box which can cause havoc with full screen apps.

If you are already using a different firewall or zonealarm, and still getting the error, try explicitly allowing the eq.exe app server rights in the firewall config.  You'll also need to do this after every patch containing the main app.
