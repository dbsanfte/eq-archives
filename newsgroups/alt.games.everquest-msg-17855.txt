That's a great idea!  Hey folks, why haven't we thought of this before?
I web browser in EQ!  That would solve all our problems.

/goodNaturedSarcasm off

Folks have been asking for that for a long time.  Mostly to kill time while
medding so you could lookup info on EQ sites.  After months and months

spell book screen.  They waved there magic wand and gave us.......GEMS.

Yeah, I admit.  I play it every now and them.  But I haven't let it kill anybody.
