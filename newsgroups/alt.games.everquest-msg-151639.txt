    Dead-on. Each spawn point (if you have a high-level bard you can figure
out where they are exactly) has a spawn table, which may or may not be only
the type of mob you just killed. So as you kill mob X, and only mob X, you
tend to see less of mob X. The effect is most obvious in places like Oasis
(Sand Giants), Everfrost (Mammoths) and East Commons (Griffons) where people
of a level to hunt mob X never bother killing the green mobs that are on the
same spawn table.

    Bats are an example of a time-dependent spawn. Bats will only spawn
during the night. The theory is that if it's daytime, the spawn points use
one respawn table and if it's night, they use another. Mistmoore is a great
example of day/night spawn tables - by day you get dark elves, at night you
get vampires.

    Zones are re-popped for any number of reasons. When the boats are
broken, the zones the boats are in are re-popped because the boats work like
a very odd mob and re-pop with the zone. Zones can also be re-popped if
certain other NPCs are broken in some way.
