There is a LOT of blue conning mobs at 45 in EW...dozens.

Your character must be a dwarf...*everyone* starts out with good dwarf
faction, but if you've only killed a few giants and are already warmly,
then you started out above the normal.

>3.  How do the dragons figure into this.  Killing giants improves faction
>with Dragons? When and how does this come into play.

Dragons and giants don't like each other. At all. Dragons and dwarves are
indifferent to one another. Doing storm giant quests lowers dragon faction,
doing frost giant quests lowers dwarf faction.

>4. Can you pass through the southern/lower part of Kael Drakkel to Wakening

Not unless you are invis. Or not KOS.

>5.  I see people put all this effort into the prayer shawl qwests, is the
>final shawel worth all that effort.

Since the final shawl has not been found (as I recall, the current best
shawl is the #7), it is hard to say. Based on the #10 ring, I'd say it will
come out as being pretty damn good.

>6. Are the high level parties which raid Icewell Keep under/beneath
>Thurgardin, killing dwarfs because they have decided to gain Giant faction
>and do not mind being KOS to dwarfs and in Thurgardin.

That is one reason. The other is that they are simply hunting the
non-faction monsters that live underneath icewell keep. There are some
really nice drops down there, and it is an excellent source of quest gems.

>7. I naturally assumed as a good character, I should work on keeping good
>dwarf faction.

Giants support paladins just as well as dwarves do. 

>  What is the benifit of giant faction. 

Good kael faction allows for considerably easier travel around the
continent, especially for classes that cannot invis themselves.

Kael armor quests have the best AC in the game...by *far*.

There are *lots* of kael quests...far more than thurgadin and skyshrine
combined.

There are hefty disadvantages to go along with it...thurgadin is a complete
city for trade skills...kael has nothing for trades. The rings/shawls are
quite superb both as quests and as items, and kael has nothing remotely
close to them. It is easier (that is...it is possible, where in kael it is
not) to get flowing thought items through skyshrine/thurgadin quests.
Thurgadin quest armors are the easiest to get out of the 3. Skyshrine quest
armors have better stats (except ac) than all others. And on, and on.

Eventually. Although Wuoshi in the wakening lands is a dragon and would
take a dim view of you.
