Im sure you've already checked this, but check to see how much ram your
motherboard can handle.  Some of the older boards had limitations, and while
a 1.3 is not "old" really, you should still check to see if it can handle a
stick of 512.  But personally I would upgrade my video card depending on
what type of video card your going to upgrade to.  I'd love one of the Ti
series, my hercules prophet is getting ancient already.
