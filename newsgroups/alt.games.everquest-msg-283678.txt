Thats a list from Alakhazam, I put X's in the spots where I think they 
might not be included.  But thats just guesswork.

I have heard several people say, for example, that POK will be included. 
  This is such a huge difference that I'd really like to know one way or 
the other; if it is, then travel, quests, gear, potions... the location 
of the "quasi bazaar", almost everything, really changes dramatically. 
The probable absence of Clarity potions, for example, is one thing thats 
been stopping me from trying a Wizard.


Is there a definative list somewhere?  Even just reports from beta 
testers?  Most importantly, whats up with this POK thing, I'd think that 
would be.. lets see, three months per expansion, what, a full year away?
