    Given that the spell list appeared in a file VI knows is actively
parsed, and given that it was "yanked" back out shortly thereafter, this is
either a screwup or a test balloon. My vote is on the balloon, but I have
more faith than some. ;-)

>Wizard pets?!

    Not just pets, but familiars. It will be interesting to see if that
implies something more than just another weak-assed pet. Otherwise the
wizard list looks pretty barren.

> A whole line of group skin like * spells for druids.

    No group versions for clerics, of course. The cleric spell list is
mostly junk - AoP turning into a line of spells looks great, group Aegolism
will be nice, but look at some of that garbage. Sentinel, another garbage
DoT or two, DD spells that are not improvements on current spells, an
overcosted HoT at lower level, an AoE stun with a DD component to break
mezzes, a version of MoK (which is already pretty damn nerfed) TWO LEVELS
before we get MoK, and a spell that absolutely terrifies me: a level 60
version of Complete Heal, with no visible differences from CHeal. Here comes
the nerf train.....

    Druids may complain that what they get isn't very exciting, but with the
exception of AotF at 49 I'd trade what clerics got for the cleric version of
what druids got in a heartbeat. If you want to get me excited, I can name
three spells I'd love to see clerics get at lower levels: Divine Glory,
Divine Strength, Divine Favour.

>I'm very curious what the Ench spells "Enchantment of *" turn out to
>be.

    Those SOUND like some sort of weapon enchantment spell, but I really
can't do more than make a blind guess. That spell list is pretty intriguing.

>Shamans get a grow spell. Oughta be fun. We get to see ogres that are
>even bigger!


    Aiiieeee! Giant gnomes! I just hope this isn't indoors. Over the weekend
I got to listen as several trains converged in Sol B at the zone - and the
single unshrunk ogre who was being PLed there. Sounds like King, Bats,
DB/Nox/SS, and some random folks in and around circle/Noble all got creamed
trying to squeeze by fatty, who wasn't moving for anyone or anything. I can
imagine how fun it'll be when others want to "be big!"

    Overall, from a cleric's perspective the list of spells disappoints me.
I see most other classes getting stuff that would be NEW, and not us. Druids
get more group-friendly spells, and another spell that'll make them use
anon - a corpse timer refresh spell. Enchanters get to become masters of
enchantment, and get a new illusion spell. Mages get a few very
interesting-sounding summoning spells, and a level 60 spell that adds new
functionality to their class. Mages are also enhanced by the new ranger line
of archery buffs, which give rangers a new way to contribute to groups
without low AC being as much of an issue. Necromancers get new
group-friendly debuffs, and a limited-target slow line. Shamans get a new
line of DD spells. Wizards get familiars. SKs... well, at least you don't
have to taunt with Disease Cloud. :-/ Clerics get nothing new that has ANY
use save the self-only buff line, and there's even a hint of a nerf with the
level 60 CHeal. The only way something good could come of that list is if
the level 54 MoK-clone was actually a mirror-MoK - every time the mob hits a
PLAYER, the PLAYER gains four or six HPs. I don't know that it would be
useful, but at least it would be different.

    So now comes the open question: what will bards and paladins get? In the
past paladins have suffered, getting spells that were shadows of what the
party cleric already had. Some of the new spells on the cleric list look
like they'd actually fit well in the paladin portfolio - hopefully they'll
be moved over. Imagine paladins with a 500 mana, 12 second casting time
CHeal at level 60 - yummy!

    James, master of the class whine.
