Man did you do it the hard way.  Baking was the easiest, fastest, cheapest
skill to get to 188.  I did meat filets to trivial (can't remember what it
was, but you've passed it now) I bought a filet knife in the bazaar for 5pp
and then Patty Melts to 188 (actually 182 because I got bored, but you can
get to 188 on them) A friend made a frying pan, but you can usually find
them in the bazaar and you buy cheese in Jagged Pine, but after that
everything can be bought in ShadowHaven.  I got to 182 spending about 100pp
and that included the parts to make the frying pan.
