Search the web for

bank yourcitynamehere visa checkcard

go to that bank and open up a checking account, putting
some money in there. If you don't have a job, say you are
self employeed. Use that visa check card number, when you get
it, to pay for eq. Just make sure that you have money in there
when its EQ pay time again.

Mine also has a web page I can check my account status with.
Then I can conveniently see exactly when sony bills the account.

If you already have some credit cards, which those names seem to
suggest, you could also try www.visa.com and www.mastercard.com and
applying. If you already have some credit, no bad credit, you should
be approved.
