SIGNS=20
And the sign says "Long-haired freaky people need not apply"=20
So I put my hair up under my hat and I went in to ask him why=20
He said you look like a fine outstanding young man, I think you'll do=20
So I took off my hat, I said "Imagine that, huh, me working for you"=20

 Chorus:=20
Signs, signs, everywhere there's signs=20
Fuckin' up the scenery, breakin' my mind=20
Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign=20

And the sign says "Anybody caught trespassing will be shot on sight"=20
So I jumped the fence and I yelled at the house=20
Hey! What gives you the right!=20
To put up a fence and keep me out, or to keep Mother Nature in=20
If God was here, he'd tell it to your face, man, you're some kind of =
sinner

you are right, he would=20

(chorus)=20

Oh, say now mister, can't you read=20
You got to have a shirt and tie to get a seat=20
You can't watch, no you can't eat, you ain't supposed to be here=20

And the sign says "You got to have a membership card to get inside" - =
uh!=20

(Solo)=20

And the sign says "Everybody welcome, come in, kneel down and pray"=20
But then they passed around a plate at the end of it all=20
And I didn't have a penny to pay=20
So I got me a pen and a paper and I made up my own fuckin' sign=20
I said, "Thank you Lord for thinking 'bout me, I'm alive and doing =
fine", oh=20

(chorus repeats 2x)=20

Yes! Some old song, called "Signs Signs", I wish we did write that one, =
but=20
We didn't - wow!=20

Alright=20
