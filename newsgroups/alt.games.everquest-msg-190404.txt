Well, everything but hand to hand.

Rangers do most of their damage, over most of their lives (things
start to change later on), with two 1hs weapons.

-Your epic is two 1hs swords, and it is really cool.  No matter what
you do, keep 1hs up, and I suggest you default to this, also be sure
your dual weild skill is maxed.  (Once you get dual wield at 17)
-Several common (cheap), yet effective weapons usable by rangers are
1hb.  Keep 1hb up.
-A great weapon for rangers is the lupine dagger, 9/18 (better than a
lammy's ratio) with a greater wolf form proc.  This is a piercing
weapon.  Keep piercing up.
-A very popular, ranger-only 2hs sword is swarmcaller.  This casts a
slow spell on the MOB.  Keep your 2hs up.
-Don't worry about archery right now, unless you happen to loot a bow
and some arrows or something.

-2hp weapons for rangers are pretty scarce.  You can probably get away
with ignoring this unless there are some uber, no-drop weapons out
there that I have never seen.
-There are a few nice 2hb items out there, but nothing that has ever
made me worry about keeping this skill up.  Up to you on 2hb.
-I have never seen a hand-to-hand (martial) ranger weapon and more
importantly, this skill is capped at 100 (meaning you will never do
much damage using your fists).  Don't bother with hand-to-hand.

> Can I build skill in these by bashing up greenies (not for exp just weapon
> skill)?

If you cant build skills in groups or solo, find a group that is
pulling MOBs that would give you experience and ask if you can work on
a skill.  Make sure you assist their tank.

You cannot skill up on greens.  (with the exception of some skills you
cant work on anyway.)

You can buy sharpening stones in Halas.  Near the regular smithing
merchant.  (outside, behind a building)  It's a small town, you can
find her in no time.  If you have the PoP expansoin, this would be
much quicker though.
