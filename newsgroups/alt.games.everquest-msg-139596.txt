For ultra fast leveling you do not need to leave odus.
Head to kerran isle (off tox)
Bind your self outside (Making sure you have a few bonechips an food)
You can level there from 14 - 18 in no time.
There is a 20% xp bonus, and the entrace mobs are quite easy.
Best of all there is never anyone there so it is a free camp.
I made level 17 there at the W/e doing 16 - 17 in an hour and a half.
Not that the xp bonus is so good that at 14 it will take you 2 kills to
recover from death. Some times dieing is faster than medding <G>

The down side is : No loot for joo!
You get virtually no loot at all.

I would level to 16/17/18 in kerran isle, then head back to the warrens
and farm plat.
At 16 I can easily make 35pp each time I fill my bags, this takes about
45mins.
SO you can soon build up some cash, and you also get some incidental xp
from the molar quest.

If it only takes you 5 hours to go from 14 to 18 you can then afford to
spend a few hours killing kobolds for pp.

Just my 2cp

Jim
