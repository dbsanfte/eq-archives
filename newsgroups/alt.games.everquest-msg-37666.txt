Who says that you hafta use your local ISP's newfeed?  I subscribe to
usenetserver, which I am very fond of.  But I have a few friends who
use this free German news server and they seem to like it a lot.  I'll
see if I can track down the info on it if you're interested.  The
downside to it is, I think it doesn't carry any binaries froups.
