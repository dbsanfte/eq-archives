I'm told that any potion that replicates the Gate spell casters get
can fizzle and that you lose the potion in the process.  Thurgadin,
Field of Bone etc won't fizzle.

Having said that you know the RNG *really* hates you if your 1k vendor
gate pot fizzles leaving you out of pocket and most likely looking
forward to a CR as a bonus.
