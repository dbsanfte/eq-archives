Interesting relevent quote from Jim Carrey talking about his new movie
("A Series of Unfortunate Events"):

'"He's a sociopath," Carrey says in his first major interview about
the role. "There's a bit more of an edge to this than the Grinch (whom
Carrey famously portrayed in the 2000 film version). But the danger
has to be real. If it isn't, the victories the kids have aren't
real."'

Funny how in such a simple way, a goofball actor like Jim Carrey
talking about a completely unrelated movie has more insight into why a
weak penalty for death is not necessarily a good thing than a dozen
mmorpg devs and execs.
