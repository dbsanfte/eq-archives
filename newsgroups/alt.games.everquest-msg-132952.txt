For starters, I have never stacked all those dots, and the low end
dots really hamper the efficiency. You chose to ignore the Breath of
Ro and Winged Death combo, 600 mana which is regenned in a bit more
than a minute and a half. Add to this that most druids of this level
will have mana-free drones of doom: that's 340 damage, free. Factor in
epic, which quite a few of us have, and that's another 550 free damage
per minute. Add a root: 160 damage for 100 mana below 56, 178 to 190
damage for 75 mana above 56. So, for a 56+ druid with epic and a
drones item, that's 3175-3185 damage per minute for 675 mana, taking
less than 2 minutes to stand around and cast and med back.
And all this is moot if the druid has mobs as convenient as your katta
guards: with two clicky items and 295 mana to cast call of karana on
an animal and root whatever dark blue mob I sic it on, I can kill two
dark blue mobs in slightly more than a minute and have a considerable
net mana gain. As it is, when I solo one of the zone tunnels in
Chardok (it's a rare day when I can cherry pick dark blue mobs from
both tunnels undisturbed), my kill rate is more limited by mob
availability than by my mana.
I also have the option to park a small handful of adds and kill them
later. What can your monk do other than feign and hope they buy it?

*shrug* I used it to buff our entire HoT party the other night
(leather night, yay!) as none of our 60 clerics were around.

You seem to care about your monk's regen abilities.

Wizards are specialist nukers, so why shouldn't their specialist nukes
have that large a margin?
Druid moonfire has a *slightly* better efficiency than wizard
sunstrike, both 3.6 damage/mana (I want moonfire). Wildfire is 3.2
damage/mana.
Cleric judgement is 2.85 damage/mana. 
Mage shock of fiery blades is 3.0 damage/mana. Seeking flame of Seukor
has the same efficiency as wildfire.
Enchanter Dementing Visions is 2.7 damage/mana.

And as for your two minute spread, which I would like to see the
numbers of, why shouldn't most casters have access to some decent
nukes? Sometimes, you just don't have anything better to do,
especially for mages. (And no, I don't feel sorry for shamans and
necros, not with their dots >:) )

>400 mana 7000 heal from the cleric

It makes a visible dent in even the highest HPed tank, and I've used
it to save main tanks on raids.

>Yes the monk hunting ground is smaller than a druids but then again a druids
>hunting ground is much smaller than a shamans, chanters, or necro.

Ever seen a druid and an enchanter team up?
