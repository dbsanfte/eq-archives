Generally, as a cleric, your first priority is keeping your group alive.  
This usually means healing, and medding to have the mana to continue 
doing so.  Nuking is something that you will generally only do when you 
have excess mana.  On the other hand, when the cleric states that he 
needs to med, the puller had better not pull another mob until the cleric 
say he is ready.

As far as dying at that level, personally, I would not bother with any 
kind of rez, barring being bound far away from where I died.  It is 
faster to just run back, loot the corpse, and get back to xping.  At that 
level, in PC, one or two kills will get back the xp lost to a death.  The 
reason to avoid a rez is that the rez effects last longer than it takes 
to make up the xp.
