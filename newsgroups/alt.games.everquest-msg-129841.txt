Agree, but doing a piss-poor job, don't you agree?

Dude, we are *way* past who is a guest in whos land.  Need to
get on with the program, bust a move, and either fight like
a *real* group of people or take what they can get.  Constant
whining, and misplaced human empathy, and sloppy emotions and
"guilt" have NEVER been known to be a winning stragity. Agree?

But then we wouldn't have a democratic, balancing force in the middle east,
and even the middle East *themselves* wouldn't want to see Israel go.
Shit, just ask the common citizen of Saudia Arabia, Iran ro Iraq just
how *good* an Arab leaderhip does for the average Arab, much let alone
imagining an unchecked Arab regiem run amok.
