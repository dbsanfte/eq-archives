I like the idea of this server.  And if said server had existed when I first
started playing, I would have liked to play on it.  But thats not really the
question you asked.

Despite prefering the ruleset, no, I would not start over on that server,
nor would I transfer to it.   I have too much invested in E'ci to ever leave
it.  A lot of friends that I enjoy playing with, a good reputation and a
decent spot with a very good, and very unique, raiding force.   While I
would meet new friends on such a server, it wouldn't be the nearly the same
thing.. and I sincerely doubt an equal public raiding force would spring up
there.

So... love the idea, but I don't think I would be involved in it. ; )
