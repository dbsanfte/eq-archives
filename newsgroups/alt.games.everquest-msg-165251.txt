    Given the items listed, cost is clearly no option! So things you are
missing:

Back: yours is junk. Iksar Hide Cape, Hierophant's, Cloak of the Maelstrom
(if you can spare the weight) all beat this.
Chest: would be great if you were still whacking on mobs, but if you have
the Heart you aren't doing that. All sorts of upgrades out there, the one
I'd lean towards would be a Crimson Robe of Alendine.
Ear: too bad you're still too low for the good stuff out of CT. For now,
Carved Bone Ear Spike/Shai'Din Revenant Bauble and a Hammered Golden Loop
should suffice. As soon as you're high enough that (your_level/51)x55 > 35,
swap out the low HP earring and quest up a Solstice.
Hands: Grey Flesh Gloves, for sure. Your resists are low.
Head: replace with a Platinum Tiara until level 35.
Shoulder: If you don't have another Affliction Efficiency item, Squallsurge
Shawl. If you do, Cloak of Fading Hues - get those resists up.
Waist: Bone-Clasped Girdle. Swap your current one in for summoning pets, if
you don't like waiting.
Wrist: at least replace the Steel Wristband with a Golden Bracer for the
range focus. You don't have T/JBoots listed, so you'll need the space to run
in case of a Darkness resist. If you do have boots, or a source of SoW
potions, no worry here.
Secondary: I never tested it - does Improved Healing go off on 'taps? If so,
keep this. If not, Orb of the Infinite Void.
Ranged: lots of possible upgrades. Bronze Statue of Bathezid, Eye of
Narandi, Crypt Master's Conjuring Stone, Dustscryer's Crystal Ball. Until
you get a post-44 lifetap I'd strongly suggest the Ball.

    Net of these changes, you should be quite beefed up on HPs and still be
over 200 INT. Now you'll have room for KEI to take full effect, when you buy
it at lower levels. When looking at what I've suggested, really try and make
sure to get the focus items in place. Affliction Efficiency is 25% mana
savings - no other item on your person will haste your XP quite as much as
that, not even the Heart.
