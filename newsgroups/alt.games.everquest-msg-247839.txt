I didn't - funny thing was when I looked at their website, it was an Officer
doing the training.
You can never tell what would have gone down in guildchat, but I thought if
they believed this person even after our ooc messages and tells, fat chance
the guild would do anything about it.
I was guilded at that time and didn't want to cause any trouble given the
our characters were relatively low and there are other fun areas to hunt.

The other annoying thing was the person PL'ing had an obnoxious
name/surname, one that you would have thought they would have had to have
changed by now.

Ahhh....all good experience I guess.
