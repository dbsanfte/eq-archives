I have to admit to being someone with little patience.  My explanation was
addressing the part of the equation that you seemed to be having trouble
with.  Hopefully this will clear up your confusion.

In answer to your question, no, they are not the same.  It works the way I
said it does originally.

x*(2+y/5) = (x*2)+x*(y/5)

Only the terms inside the parentheses that use an operation with a lower
order of precedence are multiplied by the value outside the parentheses.

Let's try this:

assume that:

z=y/5

then the original equation x*(2 + y/5) can be written as:

x * (2 + z)

this is equivalent to:

x*2 + x*z

Now, substitute y/5 back in for z:

x*2 + x*y/5

Again, no parentheses are needed around the y/5, as division is the same
order of precedence as multiplication.

The problem you are having is that you are not properly seeing y/5 as a
single term within the parentheses, at least that is what the problem
appears to be to me.  You do not automatically multiply every individual
item inside the parentheses by what is outside the parentheses, you have to
consider the order of precedence.
