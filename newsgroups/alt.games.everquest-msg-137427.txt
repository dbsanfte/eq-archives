eq1 will end when it becomes unprofitable for them to do so. That may be a
long long time in the future tho. As population decreases, there will be (i
guess) server merges. Verant wont be coding new stuff and there wont be
patches. No coding, and less servers means a lot less to keep it running, so
I imagine they can turn a profit with only a few servers. I dont see them
closing down anything thats making a profit, so I'd expect eq1 to be around
for a long time yet.
