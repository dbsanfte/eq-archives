Rangers are a TON of fun and are actually balanced at this point.

Monks -- if you like a lot of activity and have a good sense of direction.

Warrior -- hell you've played one.

Shaman -- great solo class, great raid class, sometimes a bit hard to group.

Why not BST?  Once you get to Level 9, great solo class and great group class
for second tank/dps.
