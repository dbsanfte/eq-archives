I believe the casting time on divine aura is fast enough that you
could cast it after you zoned and survive the fall.  This could be a
shortcut to the Plane of Underfoot when it opens.  Cleric (brell
follower) and mage jump.  Cleric ressurects mage in a safe spot. 
Cleric gates to zone in and invites the rest of the raid one by one
for CoH.


Brell followers are non-kos to elementals, golems and flighty fiends. 
Most of these see through invis.  Ratmen and ghosts will still attack.
 Ratmen don't see invisible, and ghosts don't see through ITU.  So who
is the one class who are safe anywhere?

Brell worshiping rogue!

So if you fall down the hole, make a halfling (because they get
sneak/hide at level 1) brell worshiping rogue and drag your corpse
out.

High level enchanters who haven't hunted there much can navigate
safely with careful use of elemental illusion, collaboration,
invisibility, itu.  I had to do this to sneak down to one of my epic
quest mobs.


Faction conning is a bit screwy in The Hole.  Some mobs will /con
"scowls", but will not attack you no matter how close you get (if you
/con dubious or better to the elementals at the zone in).
