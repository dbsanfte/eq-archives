Clerics epic is the same % rez as their highest level spell.

Divine Res (the AA) is 100% rez, no rez effects, you do lose buffs when its
cast on you, and has an insane re-use (think r/l days here).

Btw a crappy thing with divine rez, sure enough it restores HP and mana, but
as soon as you loot your corpse, the newly-gained mana and HP from your
armour suddenly drops your mana massively.

The standard way I've seen is to firstly get a normal rez, loot all yor
corpse minus 1 item, then get a divine rez to restore mana/HP.  Kinda crappy
if you can't run back to the zone and pre-loot (thus settling for an
inferior 96% rez)
