OK< I know there's a patch today.  I"m sort of able to
calculate when its supposed to run based on my time
zone.  I know its supposed to take 4 hours more
or less.

But it being close to the estimated calculated end
of patch time, I go to the web site
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/
and take a look... all servers show as UP.

Try to log in... ten minutes of not getting in.

My experience suggests that this means servers really
aren't up.  Question being why lie about it on the
site?

I know, you've heard this a thousand times before...
but back when the posted the server population counts,
it was easy to see that servers had three or four people
on them, that they weren't really up but rather had
GMs running around testing them.

I do have other things I can fritter away my time on,
I'd like to be playing EQ but what I really don't want
to be doing is repeatedly clicking trying to log on to
when in reality the servers aren't up... there's a web
site apparantly designed to relieve me of this little
bit of tedium, but its just not working out yet... used
to work pretty well but no longer does due to changes
that verant implemented.
