Ooh! Stormhammer without a GM on, and all that extra money you're paying too
:)!

Sorry, couldn't resist that!

I don't think its worth worrying about, you're most unlikely to get any joy
from a GM. That said, no harm in putting in a petition and completing a
"contact your server GM" form but I doubt you'll get anything from it.

Some lessons we all learn the hard way, been there, done that as they say -
in my case I went afk only so long as it took me to nip from my desk to the
door to call my wife who wanted to see me "ding" for some reason (she has
odd fetishes but that has to be the oddest). In that time someone trained a
hill giant to a safe area (Stone Bridge in NK, almost at the zone line) and
I got back on the mouse too late to run. I had to call her again about 20-30
minutes later!

A guildmate lost several levels after going afk to watch a television
program and then going to bed without remembering that he was still ingame.
He'd have lost more, due to him being bound where he was resting, but our
guildmaster came across his pile of corpses and petitioned for him to be
booted. The guildmate was very shamefaced in /guildchat the next night as we
all commented on his level :).
