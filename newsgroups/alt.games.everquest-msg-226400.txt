As a bard, I pull if Im asked, I dont if Im not. Its not complicated
to soothe if required or just melee and sing mana song etc.  As many
have said, no one is good at their class if they dont know how to use
it.  My current issue is with people who are over keen and while Im
soothing keep seeing what Im targetting and then when I do pull they
cast on some soothed mob and bring more. Or, they dont wait, and just
cast on something I havent soothed and bring the room, as although the
group may see them cast, I may not if Im in the next room, and all I
know is something in the room far side I hadnt done a thing to has
agro'd bringing the room, the group may think Im crap as a result.
