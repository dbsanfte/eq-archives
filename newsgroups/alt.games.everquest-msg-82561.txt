Aahah that reminds me, I have a monk friend named

"baytor" (you can probably see where this is going.

His name has always been baytor and he never meant for it to sound
like anything else. ( did not think to ask him if he named himself
that perhaps even pre kunark. Anyway, once he reached name level of 55
or whatever his name shows up when you do /who all monk or whatever
as:

58  Master Baytor

The weird thing was It had been like that for along time when I first
was doing a /who all guild and noticed it. I laughed about it and
asked if it was intentional. Evidently some other people had noticed
before that because like the very next day it was changed by a GM.
