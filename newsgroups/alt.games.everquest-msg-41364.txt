They gave me nothing in writing, however my social security number has been
flagged. Whether it be in their computer system, or records.

At one time, they used to call me and beg for me to give blood. I'm o-neg.
After Desert Storm, I went one time to give blood and I came up as not being
able to ever give blood again because of my involvement in Desert Storm and
as stated in my first post, where I had been and what I had been exposed to.
Of course, according to DoD, my unit was NEVER in Desert Storm, but that is
another issue alltogether. ;)
