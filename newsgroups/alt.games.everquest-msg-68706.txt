On a related note. One of the things an EQ developer was saying the 
other day was they had to load all the models into memory because people 
won't tolerate the stuttering of loading models and textures 
incrementally as people zone in etc. While this might be true if the 
textures are held in compressed files, I bet that they could make it 
work quite acceptably from disk if they memory mapped this cache file 
thingy.

In other words, dump out all textures into a big cache file, memory map 
it and pluck out textures on demand. Win32 treats memory mapped files 
much like DLLs and executables, paging data in and other of memory based 
upon usage and available memory.

It would be pretty fast and would slash load times and memory requirements.
