Well, I know that the last kill we did for a shaman (no duoing that
one, we wanted overkill <g>) we buffed the mage up and it seemed
pretty trivial (61 mage with whatever was her best fire pet). Mage pet
had 2 clerics healing and they were bored. Shaman and druids healed
the tanks which was also trivial.
