I think that is exactly what POK is for.  That's where I normally pick up dots,
spells, rations and water.  Need some summoned arrows or buffs or a rez?  Have
a question about a quest?  Want a convenient place to meet up with friends and
do that trade?  Not to mention work on tradeskills, train and bank.
And it's safe.
