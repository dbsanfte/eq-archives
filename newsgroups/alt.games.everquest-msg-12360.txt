	If you're agnostic, don't screw up your Dark Elf faction by killing
DE guards (or by killing anything else that lowers faction with the
DreadGuardInner and DreadGuardOuter).  As near as I can tell, Agnostic
Gnomes are the least KOS race/deity combo in the game.  The only racial
cities where Agnostic Gnomes start off KOS are Paineel, Cabilis, Oggok, and
Grobb.  Agnostic Gnomes *are* KOS to the Neriak Necro/SK guild, and if you
hunt in Crushbone to any extent, you'll be KOS to the Warrior Guild (and to
one particular low-level guard who hangs out up near the front of Neriak,
and who seems to be on either TheDead faction or IndigoBrotherhood
faction).

	This is useful for hunting in Najena, Solusek's Eye, and Nagafen's
Lair, since those places are less than 5 minutes from Neriak.  It's also
nice if (like me) you help a friend do the Soulfire quest and hose your
Freeport Militia faction.  I can't go into East or West Freeport anymore,
but I can go to Neriak.  And it's also funny to see the strange looks I get
when the inkies see a heavily armored gnome go running through their city.

	If you're not Agnostic, disgregard the above.  You'll be KOS to the
DE guards from the beginning.

	Also:  If you're gonna play a Gemchopper, don't let people get you
into thinking that you can't compete with the big boys.  Stats are mostly
meaningless in EQ, particularly at high levels.  At 45th level, I was the
puller for most of my groups in Karnor's, and I was often told that I was
the best puller my groupmates had ever seen.

	The rest of it wasn't Gemchopper specific, and was stuff I'd tell
any Warrior:  AC is king, stats are mostly meaningless, and at high levels,
dual-wielding two fast 1-handers is almost always better than wielding a
slow 2-hander.

	If you wanna be serious about playing a Warrior, the Warrior
message forums on http://eq.castersrealm.com and http://eq.stratics.com are
both quite good, and have a high signal/noise ratio.

	Check out the screenshots of my Gnome Warrior at:

	The first one in particular reminds me of your "/em hugs %t's leg".
