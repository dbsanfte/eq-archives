Actually, from what I heard...  It is suspend... Then Ban.  When it is a
ban, it is pretty much death.  And that only comes when the player is
abusive as hell.  Suspension tends to be about a week, and they note you
for it on your account.  Does it prevent you from getting another account
and resuming the stupidity, don't know, but I think some people would
probably be assinine to do it, especially if they happen to know other
player's accounts.

Oh, and hacked accounts... They perma-ban them, I believe.  When you have a
compromised account, there is no way to tell what happen that could be on
purpose or because someone else did it.  And Guides do try to talk you out
of saying you were hacked, mostly cause they DON'T want you to get banned.
They do feel for you about it, just that no way to bail you out from it
either. :P
