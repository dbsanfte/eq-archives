In fairness, you've only been a pet class for 22 of those levels :-)

My 49 pet hits for exactly the same (55 max) regardless of whether he's
hitting, piercing, slashing, or crushing.  He dual wields whether or not he
has 2 weapons (give him one sword, for example, and watch him slash and
hit).  I'm not sure if a Velium Shards proc a few times a fight would be
considered "significantly increased damage output" but it certainly can't
hurt :-)
