Mobs of an equal level in a given zone all give the same
amount of exp.  note that "con's yellow" is not the same
as "equal level"... a yellow mob may be one or two levels
higher than you, while blue may represent quite an array
of levels.  Red and green obviously represent the widest
range, red anything from three levels over your head all
the way up to a level 60 mob, while green may indicate
anything from a level one mob up to just barely sub blue.
Interestingly, certain green mobs are actually still high
enough level to give a smidgeon of exp.

Further, you'll find that even if you can pinpoint the
level of a mob exactly, different mobs will represent
different risk levels, depending on your strategy and
capabilities.  Some animal mobs, for example, like the
crocodiles in Oasis, completely ignore anyone that
isn't fighting them, even if that person is fighting another
crododile.  Fighting on the oasis beach, you can (almost)
safely sit and med back up, and then pick your target and
engage it one at a time.  Each crocodile is harder to
kill, bites harder, and drops less loot than a similarly
leveled orc in the same zone... but the orcs watch out
for each other and for you-if they spot you they will
come and get you, and they can easily end up coming at
you three or four at a time, ones -well- over your level
as well as your entended pull.  If you have a good puller
who can grab you just one orc at a time and allow you to
fight it in relative safety, the orcs will be easier and therefore
give you more exp per hour, as well as a lot more loot.

Lake of Ill Omen is a zone with a substantial xp bonus,
as are all "newbie" zones... but as it includes mobs
up to roughly level 30 that may be easily engaged,
its a real boon to leveling up rapidly.  Just exercise a lot
of caution, get to know the various mobs, thier abilities
and behaviours, and you should do fairly well.  16 is
low for most non-Iksar to venture there, which means you'll
have a hard time finding groups in your range, unfortunately,
but it is high enough that the mobs you are looking for will
be far enough away from the newbie guards that you'll not
have to worry about them... the reason that you don't see
non-iksar 1 to 8 working the LOIO!
