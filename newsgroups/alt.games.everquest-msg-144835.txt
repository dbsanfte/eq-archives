** Friday, August 30 2002.

Another week, and quite a few more changes. Some of these have gone in
unannounced earlier in the week, but here they all are, nice and organized
for you.


** New Particles:

- Welcome to the first testing of EQ's new, more efficient particle engine.
We've put some new effects on a few existing spells for people to look at.

- We've implemented a "Near Clip Plane" for the new particle engine. If
you're drowning in particles too close to your face, you can make this
number larger to cause EQ to "clip out" particles very close to you. This is
stored as NewParticleClipPlane in your eqclient.ini. For now, you can change
it there.

- The particle density for the new particles is controlled by the option
"NewParticleDensity" in your eqclient.ini. The range to work with is 0.0 to
1.0.

- Unlike the first version of this patch message stated, commands such as
/showspelleffects won't effect the new particle system.


** New Interface:

- Deleting Spells from Spellbook: Storebought spells are now deletable from
your spellbook. To delete a spell, right click it to highlight it and tap
the DELETE key. Please note: This does not convert the spell back into a
scroll. You will have to buy a new scroll if you wish to re-scribe the
spell.

- Item Links: When you inspect an item with Alt-LeftClick, the item inspect
window stays up. To paste a "link" to the item you're looking at into your
chat bar, click on the item's graphic. That will "speak" a link that others
can click on to see the stats of the item, as if they were inspecting it
themselves.

- Bazaar: We've added a "Focus Effect" parameter to the Bazaar search. You
can now search for focus items.

- Help Window: This window now displays once on startup for all new
characters, and its open/closed state is saved.


** Gameplay:

- Clerics now get the BASH skill at level 25 and it progresses all the way
to level 60.

- Altered Mage AA Frenzied Burnout to no longer make the pet suicide at the
end.

- Higher level PCs will be more resistant to lower level NPCs' spells.

- Erudites of Prexus now start at the proper location.


** Stacking:

- Warder's Protection should have considerably fewer stacking and overwrite
issues. Thanks to the folks at the Ranger's Glade for all of their help in
tracking this down. (Ow. No pun intended.)

- Druid Damage Shields should now all stack in the correct order.

- Druid HP buffs are no longer overwriting stronger cleric HP buffs.

- Harness of Spirit and Visions of Grandeur should interact a bit more
sanely.

- Existing effects should no longer be stripped off when the incoming spell
isn't going to take hold.

- Boon of Garou and other illusions now interact the right way.


Have a good weekend!
