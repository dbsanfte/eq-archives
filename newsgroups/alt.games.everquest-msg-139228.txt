So, EQ, when you can't run away from a debate, you resort to calling
someone a liar?  Didn't you outgrow that in grade school?

Here is the current list of what you have been running away from, you
spineless wimp:

1) You can not justify your stupid claim that " open
homosexuality hasn't been an issue until the last 20 years or so" and
therefore dropped the topic like a hot potato, and

2) You made a statement that the first article you linked to somehow
proved that some imaginary "homosexual lifestyle" was being forced on
"everyone".  I made nine statements to the contrary, you had no
rebuttal for any of them.  You then jettisoned that angle to link to a
second news article.

3) You ignored my challenge to prove your statement that I was forcing
my so-called homosexual lifestyle on anyone.   YOUR words: " All
anyone has seen is your militant attitude about forcing your lifestyle
on everyone else... "

4) You are failing to provide this policy you say Big Brothers-Big
Sisters of America Inc. has.  If such a policy exists, it should be
easy for you to provide the exact text and/or a link.   Then you need
to show how the existence of such would somehow invalidate what you
imagine my position to be.
