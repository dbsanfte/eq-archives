Has anyone else got strange graphics for Warders, Wolves and a few
other creatures in recent weeks?

My Wife & I logged onto the Test Server for the first time a few weeks
ago and when we logged back onto Innoruuk her Beastlord's Warder (Wolf)
and all the wolves in every zone have strange colours - usually orange 
and brown striped bodies, white feet, blue heads, no texture for fur,
etc. although it does vary a bit.

In addition when my Enchanter uses the Scaled Wolf illusion he is
multicoloured and extremely weird to look at.

This is true for both our machines - hers is an Athlon 2700+ with a
GForce 4 card & mine is a Duron 700 with a GForce 3 - both running
DirectX 9.

We have tried a full file check and that has not made any difference.
A couple of patches have happened since and still nothing has made any
difference.

While this is no big deal and does not affect our play in any way it 
would be nice to be able to restore things to the way they should be.

Any ideas folks?
