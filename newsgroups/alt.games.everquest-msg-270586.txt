As a professional computer geek, I'm terribly curious what went wrong.
I'm under the impression EQ1 uses a farm of Linux machines on the
server side, and assumed SOE would do the same for EQ2.  If that's
true, it's probably not the servers themselves that had the issue, at
least I wouldn't think so, since they could be easily swapped.  I
don't recall where I heard the rumor SOE uses a farm of Linux machines
to host EQ1, though, so I may be remembering wrong, and even if it's
true, who knows what they used for EQ2...

Perhaps there was a hardware problem with one of their meta-servers;
maybe all their world servers use the same back-end database server,
and that took a dive?  I could see them hosting all their persistent
data on one massive server...

What else could happen that would require a team of hardware engineers
40 hours to figure out the problem?  I'm a software guy, buy I've seen
hardware guys at work, and usually they can identify issues pretty
quickly using self-diagnostics and such (assuming you're using "real"
hardware and have a "real" support contract).
