Instead of asking a SoW capable class for a buff, why don't you buy some SoW
potions from a shaman and always keep them on hand for when you need them?
Yes, I know they are expensive for newbies, but as a wizard (sans Jboots), I
always keep at least one bottle handy, it has saved my ass I don't know how
many times.  Begging for *anything* is perceived as rude by many, even if
you ask for it nicely.  And keep in mind that a donation of a copper or
spare change for someone's time and mana isn't exactly good manners either.
If you had to buy SoW potions, you would be paying 7-10 pp per SoW (70-100pp
per 10 charge bottle, depending on your source...our guild has a shaman who
sells 10 dosers to guildees for 70pp).  Many SoW capable people *will* cast
it on you for free if you ask nicely, but that is not *everyone*--CYA and
cough for potions, especially if you have other higher level characters who
can spare you cash to do it, or acquire the potions for you.
