Sounds very familiar.  At first, I thought you were talking about MY guild
;).

In my particular guild, I see the backbone of levels 30-50ish members
leaving in droves, and being replaced by hordes of levels 5-15.  The recent
turnover has been phenomenal.

I'm starting to see where certain recent decisions on the part of my Guild
Leader have determined the course the guild has taken.  Our officers were
ready to take us up to the next stage in game-play and organization.  He
reversed all their ideas and decisions, and now we have reverted to being
little more than a newbie and childrens' guild.  Our higher level people
(and many of our more mature low to mid level people) have felt they had
little choice but to migrate.

My guild leader is a great guy, and our guild still has a wonderful
reputation.  I've profited greatly by being a part of my current guild.  But
we can't even organize a raid on Splitpaw anymore, much less a Plane.  I
know eventually, if I want to do these things, that I too will have to
leave.  :-(

Bottom line:  The guild leader and officers decide where the guild will go.
And I've found that 'rule of law,' or abiding by a set of standards, is more
efficient than 'divine right of kings,' or rule of a single personality.
