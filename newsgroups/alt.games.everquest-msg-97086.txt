There are 2 easy ways to raise it. The first one just involve doing some 
camping with non-aggro mobs around. They dont have to be blue, greenies 
work just fine.
I trained begging on a large rat while camping Gynok in Befallen. Got to 
around 100 skill there.
After that, i have just trained it while i was fighting. As a druid, i 
use the standard tactics of killing mobs, which usually end up with a 
fleeing mob that due to my snare spell are just standing still. Thats a 
perfect way to train both your weapons skills (think 140 something 1hs, 
and 138 1hb), and training begging. You cannot beg while fighting, so 
have to make the following hotkey:
/attack off
/doability X (x being the ability key you got begging in)
/attack on

Then you just press that key whenever beg are ready, and presto, you 
increase your begging skill while fighting. Dont make any money though.
