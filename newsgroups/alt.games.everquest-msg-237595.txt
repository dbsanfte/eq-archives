I would go with a half elf ranger based out of Surefall Glade.  Then take him
to Qeynos to play his early levels.  The area is flat and easy to find your way
around in.  Get bound in POK so you can use the book to travel back and forth.

Skila Windrunner - 57 ranger

Linni - 31 shaman
Stormfoot - 31 warrior
