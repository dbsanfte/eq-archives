Nah, it won't keep you from exercising but computer games and even working
during the day with computers (or worse: both) are completely sedentry. It
is not so much the lack of exercise but complete lack of movement save
keyboard and mouse, with the odd kitchen/toilet pitstop which even then is
rushed in EQ as there is no pause button.

I wasn't making the comment from a looks perspective either, but a general
health and well being. Carrying extra weight can have health
repurcussions,ie: I am having troubles with a reconstructed knee having hit
92 kilos (183cm). If anything I was drawing on my own experiences, and
apologise if anyone else has taken slight or offence.
