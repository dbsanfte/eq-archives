Royal Frosted Velium, check it out sometime.  Good planar level armor, bad
dorf faction.

Your right, you do have the right.  Everyone has the right to be selfish.  I
wonder how you would feel if the entire raid had left your unrezzed body at
the foot of Vox?  It certainly would have been within their right wouldnt
you say?  You basically stranded 18 people, if you didnt want to port them
out, the raid wasn't over, you should have stayed and done the crawl out
with the clerics and with the enchanter.

> Oh, and I didn't bind, I ported a group out and went on my way.

Still think if you didnt want to lose your precious bind point you should
have just done the crawl out.
