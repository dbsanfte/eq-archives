Huh? Lots of raids are very short boss fights. Hell lots of bosses are 
only doable by doing them *fast*. In a fast boss fight your healers 
might not even be able to burn out their mana bar for lack of time.

Happened to me Lower Guk a while back. Pali + Bard duo... bad pull... 
pali was dropping very fast bard goes to full CC, charming & mezzing 4 
mobs. Stabilizes fight at pali health around 10%. Mobs are occasionally 
breaking free for 2-3 seconds at a stretch before they get locked down 
again due to resists and tick timing issues.

Pali on low health aggro, and virtually oom. Pali cannot ivu and zone, 
its too far. Pali cannot sit. Period. When a mob breaks it will double 
hit & bash for max damage and probably finish him off. If he's standing 
mobs miss often and don't hit for max damage. Pali uses the Deepwater 
Helm to get himself to full, periodically taking the odd hit for 40 or 
50 which is no big deal. Pali & charmed pet finish one of the adds. Bard 
can now properly lock down mobs, pali heals & meds up, duo finishes the 
mobs off.

Does it happen often that a clicky heal is essential to survival like 
that? No, not at all. I would never say that. (Although a similiar event 
happened in the king/throne room in Sol A some levels earlier).

But its not hard to find situations where a clicky heal adds a little 
convenience, or reduces a little med time... someone shows up at a camp 
damaged from an add they took while incoming. Clicky heal him to full, 
while the cleric buffs him. Could save the cleric 5% of their mana bar. 
And/or knock a minute or so of downtime out. If multiple people have 
clicky heals it can be pretty significant healing...

Like i said...now its worth less, not worthless.

Its also worth pointing out that a lot of clicky heal items will 
continue to be valuable for powerleveling purposes, when bind wound is 
still low.

Really? Whats the cycle time & maximum healing on Bind Wounds... i 
didn't think it would be faster than the 100/14sec. Last I heard max 
basic bind wounds for warriors was like 52hp... bind wound takes longer 
than 7 seconds I think... but my info could be outdated/wrong.
