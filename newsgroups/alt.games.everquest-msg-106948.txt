The Imperium Knights, on Bristlebane server, hosted a very successful raid
on Mistmoore recently.  The raid leader knew what he was doing, and the new
chat channels helped alot.  We would have had no deaths at all but some
stupid bard who was not part of the raid kept going inside and pulling the
ballroom out on us.  Had a 35% rezzer on the raid so it wasn't so bad.  If
the raid leader knows the zone well, no reason for anybody to have trouble
in mistmoore.
