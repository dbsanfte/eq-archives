Soulbinders, on the other hand, were added much later.  Getting a bind 
before that point meant begging.  In some cases, finding a bind 
literally took hours.  And if you'd run/took buggy boats/suffered 
multiple travel deaths in order to get somewhere far from your home/last 
bind point, you really really wanted that bind before doing anything.

In an hour, as a real newbie, you were probably level 2.  Maybe 3.  A 
genuine newbie, now, would probably be level 5 in an hour, but thats due 
to a great many changes to the game.

At any rate, leaving your home zone as a newbie doesn't make sense to an 
experienced player.  We're talking here again about genuine newbies; 
they don't know that.  Without any knowledge of the game, its not at all 
odd for them to expect that they could make a party with a variety of 
characters that come together and play as a group.  After all, its a 
Multiplayer game.  A sensible arrangement would have the newbie zones 
all connected such that it would be relatively easy to get from one to 
another, so that you could play with your friends.  The Vision had its 
charms, but I don't think most people expected some of the difficulties 
it created until after they'd played for a while.

Speaking of irritants, by the way, this "its non trivial to log in and 
group together" plan is still in force; the instanced tutorial means I 
frequently see people on the same server, with new characters created at 
the same time, unable to find each other.  Better still, after death you 
sometimes switch tutorials, even when grouped... isn't -that- a treat? 
And the guy who allows you to switch instances has been broken ever 
since I returned to the game, so no joy there either.

When the game was young, there were few people high enough level to cast 
ports, and the ones who were were the dedicated gamers who weren't 
hanging out porting people, they were out playing and leveling up still 
further.  The "there's always a porter around" era was a bit later, when 
people saw the demand and deliberately leveled up alts to BE taxi's, and 
earn the fat cash people were offering.  Even then, I recall many 
situations where someone would be trying to hire a ride for literally a 
couple hours in OOC, while I was playing in that area.  Sometimes I'd 
get frustrated and mention that they could have walked to their 
destination in that time... but my point is, porters were hardly falling 
over themselves to get to the business.

As someone else pointed out, one solution would be to form a guild of 
like minded people and play as though the world were the way you want 
it.  Yes, you certainly won't get the full effect, because the server 
won't be "properly populated" as you put it, with other people in the 
same restrictions, so some of the emergent behavior like Taxi druids 
won't occur.  But you could pretend.

Lets say, for example, that you want to replicate the effect of finding 
a bind.  OK, when you get to your destination, ran 2 120, then
/ooc looking for a bind
for that many minutes before using the soulbinder.

Want a port to your destination?  Again, ran 2 120, then
/ooc looking for a port to x
for that many minutes... but also destroy that number of PP, as 
naturally the bribe you'd offer for the service would increase the 
longer you waited and more frustrated you got.  At any rate, once you 
reach your "found a port" time, just take POK and pretend it was a port. 
  Remember to run out to an actual druid ring/wiz spire though, thats 
where the port would really land you.

I assume you have  a main with some real money.  Resist the urge to 
twink your character out, but you can use his cash to simulate the old 
world economy.  When making banded armor for skill ups, destroy it but 
have your main give you 1pp per AC for it; this stuff used to be 
popular.  Later, when making Plate, give yourself 10pp per AC.  No, 
wait, forget that, you couldn't make plate till your skill was much 
higher than it is now, you can only pay yourself for plate made when you 
get your skill up to the 175+ range.  Tailoring?  Give yourself 100pp 
per backpack.  But before making any of these sales, remember to go to 
the EC tunnel and offer the items in /auction for ran 2 120 minutes.

Epic Dawn isn't running that sort of rule, but we're being hardheaded in 
another way; refusing to buy items from players, or items that players 
have sold to vendors.  This captures, for us, another of the "it was 
better in the old days" features of the game, where you could loot 
something and have it be an upgrade.  Its both frustrating (I could have 
Far better gear, and be able to do far harder things as a result) and 
rewarding (I looted a black steel wrap off a drakkal wolf... Upgrade!)
