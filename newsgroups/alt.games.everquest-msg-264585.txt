The dev's have posted on the message boards that the all access pass will 
include EQ2 "when it goes live".   So EQ2 won't show up in the 
advertisements for the pass until the game goes live on Nov 9th.  Who knows 
if it will show up in the ads just prior to, on, or within 30 days after the 
live date, but it will show.
