It seems to me that it is possible that the usual no stacking rules for
haste and instrument mods could be changed with augments since the augment
adds to the item instead of directly to the player.  However looking through
the lists of items and augments it seems like there is no haste item that
will accept a haste augment and no instrument or instrument mod item that
will accept a matching instrument augmentation.  Have I got that right?
Really would have liked to make a better drum or a better brass modded
weapon or armor.
