c) a couple mobs aren't stunned, just for enough time to hit once or twice
each.

The one time I've done AOE group, this happened with some frequency.
Not only during the killing, but in the "holding pattern" phase.  We had
two chanters, but even the best odds two chanter combo has only a 98%
total stun rating, according to one of the other posts in the thread.  This
means that one mob in a 50 pull gets out from under every other stun
cycle on average.  I was healing the chanters with fast heals till we were
ready for nukage.

Thing is, healing two chanters and a puller all at the same time strikes me
as possibly (not probably, but possibly) dicy, and as you note, one of the
chanters dies and you suddenly have a much riskier situation.

I don't think I was throwing heals out that were particularly better than
what a druid could do, though.  While I'd want a cleric handy for rez
in case of wipe, as far as operations go, does a cleric really offer any
more than a druid does for this sort of thing?

On the other hand, if you have a druid you get fast transportation
to your AOE destination... or to more than one if you find the first
is occupied.  And you get an evac out... not useful for emergencies,
of course (there is no AOE group emergency that can wait 9 seconds
for an evac) but handy when its time to fold up your tents and go
home.  Plus, I enjoy hanging out with this particular druid, so I'd be
willing to stretch unless its crippling to do so.

a) is certainly the best possible result but I think in the real world the
best you can expect is c)
