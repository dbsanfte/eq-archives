My husband has played in the past, so I usually don't get static.  When I
do...

"Dinner is 'fend for yourself' tonight.  We have way too many leftovers in
the fridge anyway, I couldn't fit another meal's worth in there."

"Honey, I *had* to stay up until 3AM because our daughter was still awake,
so I couldn't very well go to bed, could I?"

And my favorite, since he plays sometimes also, so I know he knows what I'm
talking about,  "I was just about to come to bed when a spectre popped up
out of nowhere and slammed me.  So then I had to hike back all the way from
Highpass to retrieve my corpse, cause I was too stupid to remember to get a
bind, and of course I had to wait for morning in Kithicor woods to go
through there...and... and... can I have a hug? <sniff>"  (JK... but it
*could* happen)
