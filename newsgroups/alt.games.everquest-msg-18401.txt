I use agp rage fury pro 128 with dx8 and the special ati drivers for dx8
from their website. I have not had to update the drivers or the bios or
anything since i got this card. The creative labs tnt 2 ultra 32 meg card
was creatives labs no the new Nvidia biased one so had to use old july 2000
something drivers and it was a pain in the arse not to mention frequent
screen blips that had me restarting the computer often. For eq ive not had 1
prob using this card fast and great detail an no hassle use.
I used to have a hercules terminator beast (its broke in half now...)  :D
Ill go out an buy another rfp 128 in a heartbeat if i can still find one.
