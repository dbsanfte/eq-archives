}I take it you did not read the post that started all of this flaming.
}To paraphrase I asked the group why top posters were abused in this
}group and then sited groups which I participate in which are primarily
}top posters.

You take it wrong.  I read the whole thread.

}I was then rounded on and abused (primarly by Sisson, Bizbee and Dark
}Tyger) called a f...tard and other names for asking what I saw as a
}valid question.  Despite contextually posting others jumped on the
}bandwagon calling me a top poster (which I am not and continuing the
}abuse).

Yes, you brought up the 'why are people flamed for topposting, it's not 
like it's wrong or something' issue again.  Guess what?  It's wrong.  It's 
been wrong, and will continue to be wrong, until all the people with a 
marked preference for bottom posting die out.  Bringing up the issue 
results in a flame thread ten times in ten.  Therefore, bringing it up 
again is grounds enough for some to call you a fucktard.  Regardless of 
whether or not you, yourself, are still a top poster.

}I included statistics taken from my groups over a period of 2 days
}which showed quite clearly the majority of posters in those group were
}top posters (in some cases this was a close call but in all top posters
}came out on top pardon the pun).

You included statistics which were roundly proven to be incorrect, whether 
because you made them up, or your statistical experiment suffered from 
poor sampling techniques.  It's amazing what you can prove with 
anally extracted statistics.  The majority of the error was in that you 
counted numbers of posts, rather than numbers of posters.  Since this 
included the same 5-6 people top posting "no it's not!" 5 bazillion times, 
this easily biased the experiment.

}At no stage did I defend top posters or any type of poster.  I did the
}post which you refrred to which was an attack by one of my groups on a
}bottom poster to show relevance to my contention that they are
}primarily top posters.

Yes, you did defend top posters.  Sorry, but there it is.  You also, in 
the very first post in the thread, included a direct taunt, to wit: "join 
the fray Ben Sisson and the wet cat."  You then acted all suprised that 
Ben and Dt flamed you?  Um, where were you the day clues were handed out?

}My orginal question (why does this group abuse top posters) was quite
}neatly sidetracked by Sisson, Bizbee and Dark Tyger.
}I could have coped with any number of answers such as:
}1. We are the original net nazis.
}2. The group does not believe in freedom of speech, thought or deed.
}3. Because it is netiquette and we follow a set of non-existant FAQs
}which proclaim it. or even.
}4. Because

Answers 1, 3, and 4 are oll korrect.  Especially 4.  There is ample 
evidence to support this view in the aforementioned thread.  Answer two is 
quite the opposite; we believe quite thoroughly in freedom of speech, 
including the freedom to flame you if you do something someone doesn't 
like.  Slight issue with answer 3, the Faq exists and is -easily- located, 
despite not having been posted recently, but it is just reiterating the 
relevant RFC anyway.

}I got none of those answers and instead got attacked without
}provocation.

Allow me to quote it again: "join the fray Ben Sisson and the wet cat."
No, no provocation at all.
