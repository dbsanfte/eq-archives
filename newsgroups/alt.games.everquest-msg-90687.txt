You trained a wedding? Well there is 100pnts right there! Now, we need to
know, did you die? did you warn? Did you lie about warning? How many mobs?
How many casualties? Was there a bard involved? Did you blame him?
Certainly doesn't seem like you regretted it so you don't lose 50pnts there,
could be a good score, let us know.
