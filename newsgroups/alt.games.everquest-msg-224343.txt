Well, this isn't SWG, where they underestimated the database needs by a wide
margin, and so don't have any expansion room.  Heck, with the LoY expansion,
they doubled the bank size--that's not something you do if you are anywhere
near running into database limits.

I'm not saying they ARE tracking this information--just that I bet they
could do it without too much trouble.  In fact, they've even got a mechanism
already that would work for it--faction.  Give each adventure type a hidden
faction, and have doing an adventure of a given type lower that faction and
raise the others.
