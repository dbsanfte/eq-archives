Speaking of roleplaying...I wonder how far people will go?  For example,
suppose I'm playing an Ogre Warrior, with very low INT and WIS.  Suppose the
group is trying to decide what way to go in a dungeon.  I have maps outside
the game, and have been there with other characters, and know exactly where
to go and what the dangers are.  The Ogre, however, would not know most of
that, and his low INT would give a good chance of getting it wrong.

If I were to mentally assign a chance the Ogre will screw up, and then roll
my D&D dice, and the dice were to say the Ogre blew it, and so I were to
give the party bad advice, steering into a room *I* know we can't handle but
the Ogre would think we could, and the party gets wipes, would I have been
an asshole, or an exceptionally good roleplayer?

Or say the party asks if a certain mob is a caster.  I know it is, but I
know my Ogre has never fought that mob, and I decide there is only a 10%
chance he would have found that out from someone else and remembered it, and
so role a d10, and it comes up 3...is it acceptable roleplaying for me to
say I don't know?
