Hate saying this but multiquesting (IMHO) is a bug.  Reason for it existing
was so that you could give a NPC stuff a piece at a time and complete the
quest.  To do that, it didn't track who gave the items just that all were
received.

As for the rip-off, that sucks but the reverse happens to.  Someone helps
someone (ports them, etc...) and the other person then runs off without
paying.  Quite common activity.

Pay upfront and you might get ripped off.
Accept payment upon delivery of a service and you may get stiffed.
