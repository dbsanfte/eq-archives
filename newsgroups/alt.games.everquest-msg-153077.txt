The music in my experience anyway, tends to hang up and loop, gets really
annoying really quickly. And normally, I turn music off in nearly every game I
play. Some have good tracks, unfortunately EQ doesnt imho. After 3+ years, you
think that it wouldve been changed from the cheesey midi sounding stuff.
