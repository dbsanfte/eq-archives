COOL! I didn't realise that!

I've got access to just about every melee item in the game. Obviously
I've been making some stupid choices along the way with loot. Could you
put together a list of items I could get to outsolo a wiz quadding in
ME, or an epic mage in Seb?

For reference, I've got Hategiver, Bloodfrenzy, Braided Strands of
Corrupted Mana, Jaelen's Katana, Sceptre of Destruction, and Primal
Warsword for damage. (Gauldrek and Tae Ew war maul for DSed mobs)
Willsapper, Truncheon of Doom for slows
Fungi tunic, Dain 10th Ring, Latent AoB, rightclick AoB, and ragefire
arms for regen and DSes.
5300+hps and 1400+ac unbuffed
Also, I can bandage to 100% and have a rightclick summon 20 bandages

Obviously I'm doing something wrong, because I can't outsolo most of the
classes you've named above, and any adds either kill me or reduce me to
major healing downtime.

I'd love to know what I should get hold of in order to "always out solo
WIZ, DRU, SHM, MAG, NEC."
