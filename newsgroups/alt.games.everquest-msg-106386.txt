Once, I had outrun some nasty train on Velk floor, blown all my mana
trying to heal someone else, and had all my buffs stripped in zone 
(I don't have all that much HP gear :) ). I sat down to med a few
seconds for a chloroblast and was killed in two hits by a feral kodiak
that had been trained to zone.

Last night, I was in DN. We had a lil mishap with Neb aggroing a
cleric that went to heal a feigned monk and didn't know how close he
was. I was grouped with a wizard, and the wizard was the one with anm
intrazone group evac memmed. Said wizard bravely stood in Neb's way so
one of our clerics (who turned out to be non kos) could get out. I
sighed, sat down to mem the group evac myself (only had my self-only
'LD safety valve' memmed) and was promptly killed :)
