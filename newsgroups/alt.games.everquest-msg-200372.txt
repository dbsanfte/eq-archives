 Do you honestly think level 65s will now flock to Sebilis? Just because
it will be blue XP doesn't mean it will be good XP. There's presently
dark blue XP in Sebilis at 65 but it's slow going when comapred to PoP. 

The only thing I imagine increasing would be soloers who can't find a
group. But even then there are better XP spots.
