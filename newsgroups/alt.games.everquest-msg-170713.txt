After level 51 you can put the experience you earn towards Alternate
Adsvancement Experience points (AAXP). With each point you can boost
your characters abilities, such as inate run speed or regeneration.
Each class has specific abilities that they can apply points to. The
more AAXP points you earn the more catagories and ablilities you open
up. After you earn  a set number of points you are given a title, such
as "Baron".

Many players have multiple EQ accounts, and even multiple computers. 

"Botting"  (short for "robot" I believe) is running two (or more)
accounts at the same time. For instance a single person may be playing
a Warrior on 1 account, and at the same time running a cleric on a
second account to keep the warrior buffed and healed. There is a
program out there called EQW (EQ Windows) that allows you to run more
than 1 instance of EQ at the same time on the same computer in a
window. A player with two accounts could then log in two characters
and use them together toggling between each instance of EQ like any
other Windows program. It takes a lot of memory and HDD space to run
EQW effectively, and the practice is NOT officially allowed by Sony.
That may change soon, based on recent changes deployed on the Test
server.

"2-boxing" is 1 person botting using more than 1 PC. This is trickier
and more expensive than using EQW (you need 2 PCs, 2 montitors,
keyboards, 2 mice, or a KVM switch to share them between the 2 PCs)
