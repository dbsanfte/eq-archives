Took a run through kithicor with my bard at 6pm. Usually they dotn spawn
right at 6pm, but there were tons of zombie guards, and tho they couldnt
catch m, there were so many i just got juked to death. No problems i think,
ill just wait till 9am next morning ond go in and get my corpse... wrong.

I wait and I wait, its 3pm and I still have about 3 zombue guards with their
pets on track (and some corporal who is blue at 47). I try to get to my
corpse a couple of times, but each time i get agrod on by one of these necro
mobs and I have to run for zone. After a couple of tries I decide to get my
necro along (IVU) to do the cr.

So I run through kithicor with my necro (this time its night), and theres
just undead everywhere. I must have passed within agro range of abot 20
undead getting the corpse, but IVU holds an im able to drag the corpse to
zone.

So I guess the moral of this story is to avoid kithicor even during the day
(there are less on track, but still some), and if you have to run through,
use the north zone wall and not the south. The south wall is deadly 24 hours
a day.
