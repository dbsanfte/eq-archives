One of the best exp quests in the game at your level is Crafted Armor(I know,
you said "other than").  Its decent stuff if you aren't a twink, I suppose, but
I did some of these quests time and again with non warrior characters solely
because the exp was great on them.  Of particular interest is the gloves, which
require an aviak charm which drops in the same zone as the quest givers, and
fairly frequently, and the bracers, because niether the drop for them nor the
items themselves are Lore (wouldn't make sense for them to be lore when you have
two wrist slots) so you can do this quest a backpack full at a time.

Time was when you could more than make your money back by auctioning the crafted
armor off, but with "mudflation" I doubt you could even break even on them now
on most servers.  Something I had luck with was retooling the crafted as small
crafted and going to Kelethin and Butcherblock and selling the improved lower
encumberance gear, apparantly many people were unaware of how simple that
"quest" was.

Lets see, another quest that yeilded decent exp at that level involved getting
aviak claws and taking them to a guy in Kaladim.  The idea was to hunt aviaks in
BB for them, I think, where they were quite rare drops.  But going to "aviak
island (motto, you'd better be able to fly or swim, cause there's no boat dock
here)" in OOT they dropped fairly commonly off mobs that were decent exp in the
20s.  Again, no item really, or coin, just exp and faction mostly.

For a game called "everquest" I really can't think of a lot of quests that are
particularly interesting in the 20s and 30s for a warrior, on the other hand, my
warrior was a bit of a twink and didn't pay much attention to such matters.
