And there, Blew, you have one opinion about the work these
organizations do.

Wolfie is quite right that both organizations get a lot of bad
publicity. Of course, when one looks at the source of that publicity -
such as people who want to completely ban guns in violation of the
second Amendment to the Constitution, or people who think prayer
should be included in public school curriculum in violation of the
first Amendment - it does sort of take the legitimacy out of the bad
publicity.

Everybody wants someone to demonize, and politically these
organizations are popular targets.


I can't speak to the issue of the NRA, as I only peripherally follow
them. But I follow the ACLU closely, and I believe they are firmly in
touch with both the letter *and* the spirit of the Constitution of the
United States. A lot of the people who strongly dislike the ACLU are
blind to the fact that the ACLU is fighting for *their* rights, not
just the other guys'.


To see the kinds of things they're involved in, I direct you to their
web site, www.aclu.org
