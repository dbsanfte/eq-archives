I was hoping I wouldn't get it wrong.  In the back of my mind, I was
thinking it might be the lympocyte count that is used as the criterion.
And it is.   When it drops below 200, you have AIDS.  Either way, the
diagnosis is not dependent on the type of opportunistic infection you
have.
(although in some cases, if you are HIV+ and have multiple opportunistic
infections, you will be diagnosed with AIDS even if your CD4 count hasn't
dropped below 200 - but the CD4 counts remains the preferred measure).
