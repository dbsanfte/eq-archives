I have no intention of flaming EMarr people as a whole. I just couldn't 
relate what this person posted to anything above it. Being a reader, I 
felt I was part of the intended audience. Also, last I checked, <br> was 
certainly an HTML tag.

On snipping their signature, guilty as charged. I try to always do that, 
but just overlooked this one.

In closing, I believe you said it best:
"Do you habitually answer posts that have nothing to do with you as if 
they were addressed to you? Or are you just stupid that way?" ;)
