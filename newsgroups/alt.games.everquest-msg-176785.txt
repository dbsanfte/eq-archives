This feature is designed to help individual players of all levels find a
group and groups of all levels find individual players to fill in their
empty slots. We've approached this in the same way people look for groups,
using terms and criteria that people use in game. For example, the
information that players would include in a shout: "I am a level 54 Cleric
who wishes to group for experience in Kunark for 3+ hours," can be used as
search criteria for you to find a group, as well as criteria for a group
to use to find you.

When a player is looking for a group, the Enhanced LFG Window will show
them a screen that allows the same options as this one. (The final layout
and appearance of these windows will be changing.)
