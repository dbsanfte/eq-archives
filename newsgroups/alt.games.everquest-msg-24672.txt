You shouldn't choose a character you're going to be playing for a LONG time
based on their stats.  Which of those races do you prefer?  That's all that
counts.  For mine I wouldn't have chosen any other race but gnome, despite
his stats.  If I was FORCED to, DE sounds pretty cool.  I have NO interest
in being any of the others.

Stats are easy enough to get up to a decent point.

Minimum CHA should be 80 naked, though a little more certainly couldn't
hurt.  If you decide that you want to be an icky race such as HUM, HIE or
ERU get CHA up to 85 and the rest into INT.

Obviously if you start with low CHA you'll want to be a little more
interested in CHA items than INT, but it's pretty easy to raise both.

Naked I think my ENC is 133 INT/ 80 CHA.  With INT gear, INT buff, and CHA
buff (at level 52) I'm at about 210/160.  The numbers are reversed when I
put on my CHA gear...AND I'M NOT EVEN TRYING.  Hell, you already know that I
don't remember the names of the CC robes...I don't pay much attention to
loot at all.  I have 3 crushed flame opals from Icewell, and I know I need
to get some piece from Kael to get a cool item, but I don't even remember
any sort of details. :)
