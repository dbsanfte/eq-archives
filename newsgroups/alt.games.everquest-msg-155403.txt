Hehe. Believe it or not, you're not the first person to offer this.
The other player also offered to pay the RL cost of my moving to and
from, though (skirting the "real cash for items" rule.)

You don't really see the effects of mudflation until you get a couple
of uberguild tanks bidding against each other on an item like this.
Back when I was buying my Lodizal Shell Shield, it took me a month to
gather up the 42k I spent on it and it was the most plat I ever had at
one time. Comparably, the bidding on this thing could go up to a half
million plat.
