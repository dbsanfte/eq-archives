Atone.  60 mana.  Wipes hate list.  Mem it, use it.  Helps the enchanter
(cleric's
number one job) helps the cleric (cleric number two job) helps the MA (sorry,
tanks, but you are number three on the great chain of life) and helps all the
damage producers (who probably won't be getting heals at all if the going gets
tough)

You cannot cast superior heal on an enchanter.  It takes too long.  If they
are going to need a heal in a hurry, its going to have to be faster than that.
If they have the luxury of time, its because they got that mob mezed, and
just need to be patched up before mez breaks on something else.  Small
wound, Great Heal.  Large wound, Celestial.  Your point is still correct,
unless dealing with cyan or green mobs, there will literally be no difference
in damage taken for a chanter with maxed AC and one who is stark naked.
Eagerly await level 51 when you get Remedy to replace your rapidly fading
GHeal.

Mem blur is the chanter version of Atone.  I don't know why more chanters don't
mem and use this, I suppose mana gets more constricted for them than it does
for a cleric, but its very handy.

Mezed mobs should also be (non damaging) snared or (non damaging) rooted,
and the chanter  and cleric should both keep their distance from them.  This
will give the tanks some time to get the mobs attention if it does break mez
without being successfully distracted.  Of course any intelligent mob would
kill the chanter first and the cleric second no matter what that warrior said
about his mamma, but luckily Verant programmed the mobs AI, so they tend
to get distracted.
