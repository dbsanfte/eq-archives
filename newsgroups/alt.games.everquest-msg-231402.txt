Kind of, but it was still nothing compared to the horrible post 50
penalties. Since even double it was not as bad as the penalty for
above 50 playing they made later. I played back when the death
penalites were double, as well.

I remember on my druid, who easily soloed through 50, I was crying the
first time I died in level 51 after kunark was added. Before that I
was taking maybe 40 minutes to an hour or less to make up a death, in
50, solo. So even with that old penalty it would only have been twice
that. In 51 the penalty was insane, though, if you had any unressed
death it was like days of XP gone if you were soloing.

It was the first time i ever felt that I needed a resurrect in order
to keep playing. It was also when I began to hate the game. I really
think you should be able to get along OK without needing other
players. Granted they should make it easier, but you SHOULD be able to
get along. The post 50 death penalties just set you back so far you
could not really get along.

I still don't know why they made them SO horrible right at 51. It was
not gradual in the least, it was like hitting a brick wall.
