Because any char I've left swimming with low mana tends to result in
my being greeted with a "pain and suffering strikes you" and a rousing
chorus of "Let's all do the NAKED CORPSE RECOVERY RUN!". 

That may also have something to do with my prediliction for casters
rathers than grunts.  Low stamina seems to affect them quite a bit
more.
