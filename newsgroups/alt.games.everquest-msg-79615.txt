OK, now lets extend that a little bit.  Ignoring which is better for off
hand vs primary hand, just looking at what does best in off hand.

10/20 weapon magic number is 21.
21/40 weapon magic number is 43.

Over 60 seconds, you get 30 attempts with weapon number 1, 40% hit, gives 12
hits.
With weapon number 2, you get 15 attempts, 6 hits.

.8x21x12=201.6DPM
.8x43x6=206.4DPM

The slow weapon with the slightly better ratio does more damage over time
than the faster weapon.

Now, some of those swings will miss, or be blocked, or dodged, etc.  But it
will be an equal percentage on both weapons.

As to which belongs in the primary hand, obviously, the faster one, as you
get all your damage bonuses added to that.  Even if the slower one did more
DPM in the off hand, as Arolpin showed, it is an even bigger improvement in
the primary hand.

Sorry about including so much quoted material, but it is mostly relevant to
the discussion.
