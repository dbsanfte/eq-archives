I have found several places in tier 2 PoP zones where I can solo mobs 
with ease.  Takes a while to kill them, they have a lot of HP, but, 
downtime between kills is not too bad, as I am regaining mana while they 
rot.  There are likely better spots in other planes, but I can get 5 to 
6% AAXP per kill on the ones I solo.  I don't have Quiessence or Cann5 
yet.  The trick is, not to get hit.

Not saying I solo as well as a necro, or a druid or enchanter with a dire 
charmed pet, but, I'm certainly not complaining about my ability to solo 
good xp mobs.
