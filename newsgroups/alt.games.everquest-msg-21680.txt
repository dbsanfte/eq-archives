All of your basic spell and combat skills will go up as you play. The
only exceptions are skills that require a certain level (med, dodge,
etc). It is possible to never use a single training point (except
those required for a skill).

You can use practice points to improve a skill that you find lagging
behind, or you can use them to jumpstart a trade skill. (You can only
put 21 points into a trade skill.)
