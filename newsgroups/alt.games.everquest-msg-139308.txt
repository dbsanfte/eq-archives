What I meant by irrelevant is that the current "racial" differences (
skin tone, hair, epicantic fold, whatever) have their origin on 
relatively recent migration patterns, long after modern humans evolved... 
Therefore, they are totally unrelated to earlier and more significant 
human traits, such as intelligence. 

I'm not denying that you can sometimes pinpoint someone's ethnic origin 
from their looks, but you cannot learn anything of importance, be it 
intelligence, trustworthiness or attitude, from those looks alone.

That's the thing... "American culture" is a single entity (albeit ill-
defined), so you ought to be able to express your opinion of it without 
being branded a racist. On the other hand, "Americans" is an aggregate 
of millions of individuals, and as such, you cannot judge the whole for 
any part of it, however large. 

On the other hand, being human endeavors, cultures and religions aren't 
all created equal and they don't develop equally, and it helps nobody to 
smother any commentary on those differences under blanket accusations of 
racism. The word itself has pretty much lost its meaning through overuse, 
and it's a pity and a shame, because there *is* a lot of racism in the 
world.
