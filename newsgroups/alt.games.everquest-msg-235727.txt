are these 2 separate accounts that you play at the same time or one account
with 2 characters that you've played?  If they're on the same account,
better start a necro, druid or beastlord as the warrior and cleric are NOT
soloing classes.  if they are on 2 accounts that you play at the same
time...well, there's Lake of Ill Omen, South Karana, Splitpaw, Marus
Seru...just do a /who all 25 (or whatever your level is) and see where those
people are.

and yes, despite the fact that LoIO supposedly has an XP penalty, you can
still get 2% blue per kill.
