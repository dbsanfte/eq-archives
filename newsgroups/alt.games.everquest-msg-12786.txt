It is 'evolving' and this direction is mostly due to 2 factors:
.net users and TXTers

The trouble is, words like plz, tkx, ne1 etc. all smack more of 'trying
to be cool' than actual time-saving devices. When I'm typing in a rush,
my natural inclination is to type pls or tks rather than the above. If
you're in a real rush though, you're only paying lip service to
politeness anyway. Buff requests from strangers can never be considered
a 'rush'


'Z's and 'X's and mixing letters and numbers all reek of immaturity to
me. Certainly, it's not a 100% rule, but it holds true often enough to
be a good guide. The popularised root of this 'shorthand' is the
mythical anti-establishment 'l33T d00d h4x0rs' which obviously appeal to
rebelling pubescent kids. By association, I tend to view those trying to
sound 'k3wL' by using a dumbed down version of this language in the same
way.
