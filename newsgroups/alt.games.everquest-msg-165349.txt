Well, we ended up having 10 there ( way overkill ) with a 60 Pally tanking 
the Corrupted.  It was over pretty quickly.

Tarbull was uner the world, as expected, so we petitioned that.

About 2 hours later we went back to do the Corrupted again, but had:

45 ENC
53 MAG
53 RNG
53 DRD
50 CLC

It was going to be a little chancy, we thought, but our 57 CLC ( freeing up 
the 50 CLC to log in a 56 DRD ) and a 54 PAL logged on right before the 
battle, so they came over and helped, which made it trivial again.

The GMs killed Tarbul, he spawned again in about 15 minutes, and we took 
him down.

Our small guild got 3 epic parts done last night - way cool.
