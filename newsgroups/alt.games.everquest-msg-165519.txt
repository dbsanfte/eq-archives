The problem is, that viewpoint is too simplistic.  I like parts of
EQ, and I dislike parts of EQ.  I bet you feel the same way.  I bet
most people here in AGE feel the same way, too.

If I disliked more than I liked, I'd quit playing.  Most people like
more than they dislike, so they keep playing.

That doesn't mean they shouldn't discuss the parts of the game they
dislike.

: That's about like saying you're "paying" time for a movie or a play
: you go see as well as the ticket price.

But it's true.  Time is money.
