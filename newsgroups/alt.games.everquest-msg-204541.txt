The developers agree too... The problem is that at the beginning they 
couldn't foresee having more than 40 servers, and they didn't want to 
restrict people to just a handful of race/class combinations, hence the 
stupid number of character slots per server.

At least, that's something they will get right from the word go in SWG.
