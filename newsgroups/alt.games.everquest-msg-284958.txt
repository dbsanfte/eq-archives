I overheard a pair of rangers talking in Says; one was killing some 
gnolls while waiting there in Iceclad for Lodizal to pop, and the other 
said there was a nice bracer you could get if you didn't wreck you 
faction with them.

He linked the bracers.... and they have better stats than the Darkforge 
one I'm still wearing on one wrist (yeah, I'm lazy, and there's no 
bazaar to shop in)

Yep, nice upgrade.

I've read up on the quest, and it looks like a few hours of relatively 
easy hunting, so I'll work on it when I get some free time (which 
actually is hard to come by, at this point the guild raids a lot since 
many of us are level 60, there are no AA, and thus no need to grind)

At any rate, reading in the comments on Alakhazam, I found something 
else which piqued my interest; apparantly velium shards is an 
interrupting effect; hit a caster with it and stop his spell from going off.

As a proc, this is relatively unexciting, procs tend to go off at random 
a couple times per fight, the odds of one happening to go off during the 
cast of a spell aren't all that good.

But as a clicky effect, this could be very useful to stop gaters and 
Chealers; both spells have a casting time longer than the 3.0 it takes 
to get this effect off.

Wondered if anyone has a memory long enough to go back to such primative 
  old world gear and can tell me if this is really a practical solution 
for those of us who don't have Stun as a regular part of the lineup.
