Well, tried last night when I got in, the idea was to leave it running while
I got some food, Patch errored..ok really busy, I can deal with that. I
wasn't that bothered I'll leave for the night. Try again before I crash
(sleep, bad choice of words there) Normally I share 1 64k channel for both
PC's but I dial up different ISPs on both and leave running, by morning,
nothing. Try once more while I shower, Nope, still nothing (one PC gives
message that maybe my IPS is at fault, yeah, right)

I see that loads of ppl have had the same trouble, kind of expected it. New
plan, Install EQ (again) at work (just removed DAoC...subscribtion ran out
anyway) and patch completely (E1 leased line here) start it around 11am GMT
(Most of the US is off buy then) and then Burn it to CD. I do hope the whole
thing will fit on an 80min CD (I don't have SoL so I should be ok) then
replace my home version with that, backing up Character files (for
friends/Ignore lists) and EQclient.ini. Do I need to back anything else up?

Can't say I'm too fussed atm, I know the game is going to be full of bugs
until (prolly) late January (patches will fix things and break others, be
ready for this, the previous expansions did make as many changes as this
has) and I can't really be bothered to be a beta tester for them ;�)
Besides it's nearly Christmas, I have far to many other things to do
although I may get around to ordering SoL today...if I get the chance.
