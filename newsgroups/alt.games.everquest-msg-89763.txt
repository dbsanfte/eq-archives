I solo'ed my Druid at LOIO from 19 - 33 or so. Then to OT via WW and Dalnors
(sp) Waste of time. Iceclad and snow Cougars's the way to go from 33- 34 up --
solo or grouped. Bind in FV by the bank. That will save you one run as you can
gate to the bank then run back SoW'ed and Invis. From 19 to 24 or so, stay by
the shore near the stream that runs to the FV zone. Pull toward the beach and
med there. Nothing will agro on you at the beach. It's also an excellent area
to developing your kiting skills which will come in handy later on when you are
able to quad. Experiment with snare, root, DoT. See which technique is more
mana efficient for you. When I was younger  Snare and Root did not  stack,and I
did not waste my time with that battle tactic. Now it's different. True both.
Develop expertise in both. You will use  them both later on.

When the mobs turn light blue move on to the Windmill. As you level up, move
out to the fortress area and perhaps quickly take a peek at FM zone. Find a
group at the Sarnak Fortress if  you are so inclined. As a Druid there is
really no need to group at the Windmill. Grouping at the Fortress holds out the
temptation of soem decent loot. Just make sure you egt what's your due.  Your
SoW is a life saver.

All the best.

Soloing there you will run into less opportunity to die due
