Lucky bum. I can't sell the one I have right now, and I got another
one a couple nights ago, had to give it away for free (or let it rot,
but I'm not that kind of person). To a druid named Hunneebunnie or
something like that of all things. :-)

That is true. Though the pervasiveness of KEI nowadays is sticking a
big fork into it.

The only way you could do this is...

...if it's nearly empty.

You're lucky. Xev rangers and druids appear to be cleverer than Tribs
(yourself excepted of course). Four rangers will obliterate every
griffon and anaconda in the zone as soon as they spawn. Four rangers
and four druids means people will be sitting around with no spawns to
kill. Some people have taken to killing the panthers - I guess if
you're wolfed you can bottom that faction out and still be amiable -
but most don't. Not all of the rangers realize how wimpy the wisps are
so they don't fight them.

There's also an epicced L60 druid powerleveling people there, another
pet peeve (pick a less crowded zone ya bastage!) and I assume some
bakers who want anaconda meat for something or other. All in all about
ten people who ensure you have to be really sharp and on the ball to
get any of the spawns.

Very much like South Karana back when it was the place to be, but with
considerably less useful spawns for our level.

That sounds like places like CS, where I never quadded either. But
raptors in TD, well, the only other people likely to be there are
other quadders, and to this day the place my druid hit 60 on (other
than the last kill) - the armors in wakening lands - I have never seen
anyone else killing. And this was before Luclin, after that came out
you got Dawnshroud and the Grey.

There's a lot of places to quad where you're not stepping on toes.
