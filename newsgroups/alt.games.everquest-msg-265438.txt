I don't know why specifically churches, bud I read somewhere (think it 
was the local paper, which is not published on the web) the following, 
this is a paraphrase:

Polling stations in Tennessee have been moved out of Schools, Public 
buildings that were not specifically a voting commission building, and 
full time fire departments due to security reasons post 9/11. They don't 
want people to be able to scout the places under the pretense of voting.
