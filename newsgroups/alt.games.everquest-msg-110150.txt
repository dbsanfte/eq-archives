I have, I enjoy playing Tetsuko.  Still, my main is a Paladin, and as much
as I like the druid (Fier'dal, BTW), I'm more attached to Precia.  It's not
all about powergaming to me (not that I'm saying it is to you, it's just
that your comments suggested that you think it is for me).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
