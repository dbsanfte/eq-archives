That the name was stupid is a matter of opinion. That the name was a
violation of the naming policy is *not* a matter of opinion - it is a
fact.

As for imposing my opinion on others, that's simply not possible. *I*
am not the arbiter of which names get changed and which don't - the GM
is the only one empowered to make that decision. All I've done is
bring the violation to the GMs attention.

Verant makes the rules, not me. If players would read and follow those
rules, the GMs would be free to take care of those "better things".
