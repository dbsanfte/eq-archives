No, the Squirrel in bulwinkle is named "Rocky." His actual name is
Rocky The Squirrel or something and I think Bulwinkle is Bulwinkle J
Moose? Boris refers to them as "moose and squirrel." Since they are
just animals your boyfriend and you could certainly be Moose and
Squirrel and when they were next to each other people would get it.
Your boyfriend and you would probably get some kind of name change
though if you were:

Rocky Squirrel

and

Bulwinkle Jmoose

and of course if they were in a guild with Boris Badinov and whatever
the lady was and the guild was named WhatsamattaU it would even be
more obvious. Its kind of like how you could be named Lion or kitty as
a vah shir but probably not Azlan Lion, tony tiger, Simba, Simba
Lionking but you could probably get away with "Scar."
