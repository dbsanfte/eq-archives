However, enchanter stuns in general do not seem to have a high taunt
factor. The difference  could be that the cleric/pally line are a
targeted stun; thus once un-stunned, the mob hates the caster for
stunning it specifically. Enchanter stuns are AE, centered on
themselves; perhaps non-targeted stuns do not cause as much hate as
targeted ones. This would be similar to targeting your main tank as the
target, and center of effect, for Mesmerization, the AE mezz spell. This
also seems not to piss off the mobs as much as, say, targeting one of
the mobs and casting the same spell. I've not done any scientific
analysis or anything, just conjecturing.

Regardless, it is probably the combination of effects, the stun and the
DD, that makes the pally/cleric such a good taunt. This is the same
combination of effects that makes enchanter nukes such high taunts.
