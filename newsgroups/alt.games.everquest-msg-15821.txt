Well, A guy I worked with about a year ago.. same guy introduced me to
the game, got accepted as a guide.  Part of the GM guide interface is an
occasional pop-up window ... like a delete or rez box.  For approving
names.  It goes away after 30 seconds with an automatic approve.  If you
submit an inappropriate name during peak hours and one of the GMs is
paying attention.  the name will get nuked.  If there is no-one around. 
then the name will get auto-approved in 30 seconds.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
