I'm not referring to launch, I'm referring to its massive growth rate
all the way to sometime in 2001. There was major competition in the
form of AC, AO, and DAoC in that time (as well as the non-mmorpg D2)
and EQ didn't just survive, it thrived.

It started to falter with Luclin. Not to the point of shrinking, but
suddenly it wasn't attracting new players, and there were new players
out there to attract.

Flagging, the major fractionalization suspect, did even more damage
when PoP came out and EQ has never learned its lesson from that.
Separating the playerbase into their own little worlds instead of
having them play together is a recipe for disaster.

And finally the easing up on all aspects of the game, bowing to the
wishes of the time deprived powergamers (who usually loudly and
frequently describe themselves as "casual gamers") and guaranteeing
its own decline by ensuring few people feel any sense of
accomplishment or loyalty due to effort expended.

*shrug* The game today is inferior in so many ways to the game I got
addicted to. Good thing I still have friends in game or no way I'd
still be playing the pos that this once great game has become. Hell
sometimes the only reason I stay online is to see you link more Hammer
loot in serverwide; most people on Test have no idea where it would
come from. :-)
