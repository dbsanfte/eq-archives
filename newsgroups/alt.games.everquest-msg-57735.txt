It seems to be definitely sound-related... I followed some of the advice 
here and disabled the sound card altogether, and it has been fine so far.

Apparently, the only solution will be to throw money at it, but I don't 
know what's the better choice, whether to buy a different sound card 
(although Creative seems to have the market well cornered) or splurge for 
an upgrade/downgrade/sidegrade to WinXP (which wouldn't hurt too much, 
since I don't have a dual-proc system).
