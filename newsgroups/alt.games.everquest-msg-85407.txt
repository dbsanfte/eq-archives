I logged out with my character in the smuggler area, was not KoS yet.
Signed on next morning, Dylin was up, followed him to the end of the tunnel
with the water, killed him, looted, gated to Qeynos, finished up my quest.
Total elapsed time about 10 minutes.  I know I got lucky on that, good thing
too, I just can't deal with camping a spawn point for hours waiting for a
mob.  I don't mind if there is something else to kill in the meantime, but
killing off the smugglers seemed like a bad idea, as then I would be KoS to
them.
