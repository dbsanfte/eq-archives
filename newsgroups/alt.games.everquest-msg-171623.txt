Both of those cases, the answer is yes.
Detail of answers to both: When you die above level 10, you lose XP, and
must recover your corpse to get any gear left on it. In addition, if you
want some of the xp back, you must get a rez. I wouldn't worry about rezes
until you get into the 30s.. you can generally get the xp back easier by
just going and hunting. If you do not have anything on your corpse, you can
get rezzed in 3 hours to get xp back. Or you can let it rot. If you have
gear, you have something like 7 days to get the body back. (I forget
exactly). If you don't it goes 'poof' and rots.
Rez has three effects: brings you to your body (you can be rezzed from more
than a planet away... my last rez took me from Rivervale back up to Umbral
Plains on Luclin), give you back a percentage of your xp (the lowest level
rez gives 0, all others scale up till 96%) and gives you 'rez sickness'...
crippling your char for about 2 min.
