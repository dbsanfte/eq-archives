Seriously? Wow.  I started a druid when I killed off my ranger.   I'd
heard they could solo really well.  Actually, the druid sat on the
shelf for a year before I started to play him.  I got my Wiz up to 25
.... and holding.   He just couldn't solo beyond that.  I switched to
a magician, currently at 23 with Int at 209.  Great fun, but I hated
all the walking.

The druid's been the most overall fun so far.  Glad to hear I can
continue to solo.  Any areas you'd recommend other than LOIO at my
level?  I'm currently terrorizing the centaur archers in SK.
