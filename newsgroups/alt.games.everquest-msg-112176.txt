I dissagre with more of the changes than you it seems.

The shout/ acution change is annoying, but you can still ignore it by
turning off the channels. Also the new channel commands are not
dissabled on FV so it is fairly irrelivent from a RP point of view.

The language changes are too blunt for me. I think that there is a
middle ground. They could have increased the speed, without reducing it
to the point where you can spam learn all languages quickly.

And the up to 3 chars change is a monsterous mistake in my opinion. This
is very likely to ruin the server in my opinion. The lack of twinking
and stupid alts was a saving grace on that server. The fact that you
lived by your rep (even more than on other servers) contributes to the
politeness and the RP atmosphere. I'm not going to quit over it or stop
playing on FV, but I think that it will reduce the fun to be had there.
Everything seemed to count that much more when you could only have one
char.

All IMOSHO,

Jim
