Possibly.  Maybe even some sort of step program.  That would account
for the apologies and this 'new' face we've been seeing.  I'm willing
to give him a chance just incase this is for real.  It can't be easy to change
ones ways especially when the old urges to spout what we are all used to
seeing must still be there.  That's why he's not in my KF yet.  I try to give
everyone a fair shake.  As I said, he has a lot of ground to make up for, but
we shall see what we shall see.
