That would be one of the problems to work out.  Yet, I think that to the
very serious player, twinking is a bore and takes the magic out of the game.

Thankfully, I think that such a project would appeal mostly to serious
players.  A great application I can think of:  When I was stationed
overseas, we would take our PC's over to my friend's house.  He had a room
set aside and several nic cards.  Each weekend we would come, install the
cards and play various network games, from Warlords to NetMech to Doom.  A
legitimate version of EverQuest designed to run on a lan would have been the
ultimate dream come true.  It would have satisfied both our computer gaming
needs and our desire for RPG's. ( We played a lot of Warhammer and Role
Master as well).
