Your right I probably could have handled this differently and better just in
48 seasons as a Monk, I have run into too many Druids that believe the
definition of kiting is pick a target over your head snare, root, dot till
out of mana  then train target onto someone else to kill it off for you. I
am not saying all Druids for I have meet a lot of great Druids but it seems
more and more follow this definition of kitting.
