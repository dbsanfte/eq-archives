Remember, this is a Blizzard game we're talking about. Player killing has 
always been a big part of the battle.net culture, so I expect it will 
continue to be popular with the WoW audience for some time.

As for the consolidation of PvP servers in EQ1, I think it's a reflection of 
two things: the poor implementation of PvP in EverQuest and the overall 
decline in the game's population. I expect to see more server consolidation.
