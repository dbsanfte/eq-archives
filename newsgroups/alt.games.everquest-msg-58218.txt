Unfortunately, no, there isn't a demo as such. However, if you shop
around you can find the basic game for as little as $10 USD. Also,
there is a copy being given away free with some computer gaming
magazine or other. So, you can at least pick up the game very cheaply.

After that, you get up to one month to try the game before you have to
start paying for access.
