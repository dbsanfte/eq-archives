I'm a Sims player. Love it. Also adore EQ. I'm mostly a cleric now, and
heavy into the trade skills. Try geving her  a cleric that is up to
level 6 (so the coprse doesn't rot) base her in Freeport, and show her
the wonderful world of tradeskills. 

Yes, you can have a lot of fun in this game, without killing anything. 

This may (or may not) appeal.
