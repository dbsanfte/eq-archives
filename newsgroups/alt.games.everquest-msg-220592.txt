The two characters I play most of the time are a cleric and a bard,
both are plate users, but when I come to upgrade my armour, one thing
always bothers me.

Lets assume (for sake of arguement) that I find three pieces of chest
armour. A leather tunic, a chain jerkin and a plate breastplate, each
has 14AC.

Looking at the stats for these three items, I see that all 3 have the
same AC and no stat bonuses. I can also see that the leather is the
lightest and the plate is the heaviest.

Other than for fashion reasons, is there any reason why I would choose
the plate? Generally it is much more expensive than leather, and is
much more encumbering.

Or is there some extra damage mitigation with the heavier armour,
which isn't shown when I examine it?

S.

As I lay me down to sleep, 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep. 
If I die before I wake, 
I pray I have a recent saved game to go back to.
