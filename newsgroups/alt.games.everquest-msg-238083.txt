YOU ARE A ZOMBIE

You had a good life. You lived, you loved, you lost. And now you were 
looking forward to a long eternal rest, to move on with what the world 
had in store for you. But it was not to be. Someone has dragged you back 
out of the grave and sucked your brains out too. You can't even control 
what you do, you can just plod around. Your friends and family are 
terrified of you and just want to destroy you. It's all very confusing, 
but also extremely irritating. Time to whack a screaming teenager or two 
to teach them a lesson - why did they grab the flashlight instead of 
something a bit more threatening??


(Sounds about right) ;)
