I had the same experience when I first started. This was way back when you
could loot ANYTHING off anyone even after NPC death. At first I started on
the Veeshan server and figured I'd just go pvp once I was 20+ but then I
founf out that reds and blues cant heal or fight on the PvE servers so I
moved to Rallos(this was when it was the only PvP server) But I stuck
throught it all and now I have a 51st wizardess and have been randomly
ganked once in the past 2 months. Once you get into the mid and high end
game the PvP starts to take on real meaning Ie. Guild wars or cleansing of
the paleskins!
I have some long time enemies and the spells start flying as soon as we see
eachother! I find the monster AI EXTREMELY retarted and PvP EXTREMELY
exiting!
