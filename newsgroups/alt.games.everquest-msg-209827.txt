Actually, I rarely play in pickup groups *ever*.  I usually play with my
friends.  I've never done a *drive by invite*, I think i've only been group
leader twice in my life.  I appreciate that you trimmed the post but you
trimmed the name of the guy that threw the flame at you.  *That* wasn't *my*
comment.
Not being pissy, and haven't been a little girl in years :)
