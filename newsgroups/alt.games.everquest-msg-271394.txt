Nope. Like in real life, gotta prepare what you "harvest". Sure,
there's some stuff you can eat straight from the ground IRL, but it's
going to be much better for you prepared and you're much more limited
in what you can eat. The up side is there are plenty of Artisan
recipes for the basic stuff.

Also...Doesn't matter if you're a cleric, predator, or commoner.
Anyone can harvest anything, provided they've gotten the skill in the
harvesting skill to harvest the node.
