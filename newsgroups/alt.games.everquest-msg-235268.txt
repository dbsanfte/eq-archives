IF you feel you need to get your Run 3 at 51, then go 100% into aa's till
you get it,then go back to 100% xp.  I was going to go to 62 before I
started AAing but had to wait for someof the guild to catch up at 52- 53.
Once I was a kill into 53 I started doing aa's, this left me inrange of
doing Naggi and Vox by deleveling, and also gave me one more level of extra
destruction for getting my aa's.  It took about 10 days for me to get 4
aa's, but that was at 2 - 3 hours 4 days a week. I now plan on getting to
62, maybe 65 before working on AA's again. the reason that a lot of people
stop at 62 is because most old world high end zones still give good XP at
62, where they LB at 63. Also you can get into the next tier of plains at 62
which have awsome ZEM's 140 if I remember corectly, if not it is close to
that anyway.  If you fight in these higher zones you will get even more XP
per kill than you would going after the oldworld mobs. This is because
starting at 55 you get XP on a sliding scale depending on the diference of
levels between you and the mob. If youget to a zone where everything is
white to you the Xp is just going to fly, if you stay alive.
