Yeah, wasn't that Egil's Missing Parts, or something like that? Of all the 
times I've been on the island and walked friends through it when they joined 
beta, I *still* have never completed that one. I think the closest I came 
was finding two of his pieces. One of the clues drove me nuts: "Maybe he was 
trying to get a better view", or something close. I always thought it might 
be a reference to the lighthouse that you can see up on the hill behind his 
back, across the water and I've wanted to explore near there. But I've never 
figured out how to get *to* that lighthouse. I'm pretty sure it's just 
artwork, unless I've really missed something.

The other reason I haven't completed it is because, for some reason, 
everyone always wants to get off the island ASAP. I don't see any hurry in 
leaving the Isle, especially since you can get up to 220% of experience in 
level 6 before you stop gaining experience. Once you're close to the cap, 
just leave the Isle, do your Citizenship quest and ding 8. Double-dinging is 
fun, and easier to do with the mobs that still con even to you at 6.
