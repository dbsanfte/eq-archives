I recently did a fresh install of my system and now I find that while I've
got ultravision on (Illusion: DE) that I'm still pretty much night-blind!
Light sources like GLS and torches help some, but I'm doing a quest that
requires swimming and it's darn near impossible.

At first, I thought it was because I'd forgotten to reinstall DirectX 8 but
I've put that back on, and then reinstalled my video drivers.  Now, same
thing.
Plus in some dark areas (or night), I get mobs with funky textures for skins
(neon stripes, etc).

Any help would be appreciated.
