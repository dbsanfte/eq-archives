I play both sides of that fence, and it would be nice to see some of
those changes. The last active character I started was a necro. (Tossup
between that and druid, but I liked the clothes for the necro better.
heh) because sometimes I just WANT to solo, even if I have lots of time
to play. I'm a tank as my main, and while my guild loves having me, it
can get stale after a while being MA and just having every huge thing in
the game beat on you then wait for your rez. *grin*.

But the fact is, I had a monk and a wizard before that. Both of those
are certainly "soloable" classes with the right gear, which I can now
afford, but some changes to the game layout that might make it even a
bit more friendly would make *me* a bit more eager to go back to playing
them.

Let's face it. If I group *and* solo my monk or my wizzy, either of them
will still be far more welcome in most high end raiding situations than
a necro. (Yes, yes... necros have some excellent uses in the end game,
but it's limited and not everybody knows it at that.) I wouldn't mind if
VI made it a bit easier for my monk and wizard, as well as Nec's and
Druids to solo at the high end. I'm not expecting warriors, clerics or
rogues to do it well, but you'd think a few classes could, provided they
are willing to accept that fact that they'll never get the absolute,
end-all top dungeon gear if they only solo. But the option to at least
make it should be there.

Just my 2 cp
