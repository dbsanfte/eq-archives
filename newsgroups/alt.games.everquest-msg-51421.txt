Molgarin is still skulking around the EC area, getting killed a lot while 
it doesn't hurt too much. Would have soloed (well, with pet :) his first 
giant spider at lvl 5, but a lioness joined the party.

I still go back to Fennin Ro every now and then... After a few hours with 
Molgarin, Hanrahan feels UBER in comparison. :)
