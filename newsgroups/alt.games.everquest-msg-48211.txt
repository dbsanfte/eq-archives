Wait a few levels, your skill is still capped for your race, once you
gain a couple more levels your skill will start going up, and once you
pass 100 you will get something almost every time you hit the forage
button.  If you want to start now you can always offer to buy foraged
fruits and berries.  I was still having to buy food/drink at level 9. 
At level 30, I practically beg people to take them off my hands, as I
hate to drop them on the ground, but when you start having no room in
your packs.....
