Well, it does mean a 450 mana (instead of 600) pet, which I remember
you saying you use from time to time :)

Item I'm happiest about is the Kobold Jester's Crown (Mana Preservation
III), formerly only used for buying peridots with its +30 CHA.  Might
see some more use now.  My warrior twink may be giving up one of his
Cougar Claw Earrings too (Extended Range III).
