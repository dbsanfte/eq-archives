Yea, they keep telling me that when I have connection problems.  Idiots.  
Make the damn program work with a firewall!

Well, ya already tried the ones with 'butcher' in the name in the main 
directory, you said.  I've been noticing some weirdness with maps lately, 
and there are some people claiming corrupt maps have more game-stopping 
effects.  You might try deleting the butcherblock map files?

Last I checked, there were, on the elven outpost island in Tim Deep.  But 
I didn't actually hitch a lift, so I could be mistaken.

}can't, it's something on your PC.

There's also the camp maguses to try, and the rather unique method of 
butcherblock entry resulting from creating a new dwarf and punching your 
guildmaster. :)

There have definitely been other reports of a Butcherblock problem.  
Perhaps we can isolate what it is about Butcher that makes it special... 
Did you try zoning to Everfrost, which also has an LDoN camp adjacent to 
PoK?  Or Firiona Vie/Overthere, which have translocator gnomes?
