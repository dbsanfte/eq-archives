Now on Test Server - Paladins have had their Resurrect line of spells
improved. The spells now start at a lower level, and are upgraded each
spell circle. Here's the new list- 

22nd - 00% Rez (like Revive used to be) 
30th - 10% Rez 
39th - 35% Rez 
49th - 50% Rez 
55th - 75% Rez 
59th - 90% Rez 

The goal of this line is to make Resurrection available to Paladins
earlier, and increase their value in groups at all levels. As a side
benefit, this makes an exp. rez a lot more available to players of all
levels. 

I'll check back later for feedback, thanks in advance for any opinions.
