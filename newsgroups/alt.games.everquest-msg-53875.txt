Hmm.  You're right.  You know, players might choose differently if just 
one of these quest NPCs had a couple -major- faction hits.

I mean, what if all the dinks who screwed up that event in Lfay a few 
months ago (that one with Firiona Vie and the unicorn) had suddenly found 
they were unable to shop or bank in any town in Faydwer?  Maybe they'd 
think twice next time... Maybe they'd choose differently.

Of course, it's more likely that they'd carry on for hours and hours about 
how unfair it was.
