I tend to disagree. If you make life in the RP server hard enough for
the powergamers (no /ooc or /shout for one thing. I would also remove
/tell, to be frank), chances are they won't bother playing there at all
and will leave it for the rest of us.

Yes, I agree there will be a contingent of assholes bent on disrupting
RP at the beginning, such is human nature, but I don't think it will
last more than a few weeks at the most.

Remember, the point of the roleplaying server is not so much to make the
environment conducive to RP, but to make things hard enough to
discourage non-RPrs from playing there.
