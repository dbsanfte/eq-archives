Piercing is piercing.

It's just that some piercing weapons allow you to carry something
in your "off" hand, and some don't.

So unlike slashing or blunt weapons, there are some one-handed
and two-handed piercing WEAPONS, but only a generic piercing
SKILL that applies to all piercing weapons of any type.
