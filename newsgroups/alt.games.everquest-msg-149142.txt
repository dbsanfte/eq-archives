There do seem to be a fair number of people there who evidently don't know
what they are doing, judging from the corpses.  I have not yet figured out
how one would die in CS, other than LD or lag.  I suppose you could fall
when pulling the ones near the SS zone...but pretty much every class that
I've seen hunt there (Wizard, Druid, Shaman, Necro, Mage) can levitate.

I've screwed up there on occasion (just 'cause Yvolcarn was over *there*
two hours ago doesn't mean he's over there *now*...so I've learned to
actually check out what is standing next to the one I pull :-)), but never
have been in trouble that couldn't be escaped by running for a while and
then gating.

Maybe if one's SOW got dispelled, things could go real bad real fast?
Perhaps people accidently get too close to the Drakes while kiting Wyverns?
I avoid that because I took the necessary (small) amount of time to actually
see what the Drake pathing is like, and so have no trouble keeping track of
them.  Also, if any are blue, I kill them...I was afraid of them because
they cast, but it turns out that they almost never actually cast when kited
by a Wizard.  They seem to want to get fairly close before casting, and
Wizards have fast enough nukes that we can be done with the nuke and off
running before they get close enough to try to cast.

Of course, I'm amiable, so maybe that makes a difference?  I could see it
being a lot tougher for KOS people, especially with people kiting things all
over the place.

It's actually somewhat scary, medding with a bunch of corpses around...I
keep thinking I've overlooked some great danger in the zone and am going to
get hurt.
