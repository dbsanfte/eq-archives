Now if they'd ditch the automatic selling system and force players to 
auction items for a living that would be the icing on the cake.  The auto-
sell vendor will kill the economy and some of the gameplay just like the 
other games. If you want it just walk up to the vendor.  No need to work, 
hunt, look, quest, zone, spend time, query. In other words, no need to -
play the game- , just log on, grab some money, buy the item, log off.  
Done.  Finito. You now have an uber statted helmet.  What's on tv?  
Boringrama.

I'm kind of in the minority on this though I realize. :)
