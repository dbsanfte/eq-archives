Do these two points apply specifically to the PB AOE lines?  Because those are
the only spells we need concern ourselves with, if there's a mob present that
needs single target nuking we are doing things very poorly.  Plan is to kill
50 mobs at a time, not one.

Yes, I've noticed clerics are much more likely to specialize in (alteration
IIRC, its
been so long since I assigned it and you can't read it in the list) the healing
specialization,
making our heals even more efficient relative to most druids and shaman than
just reading the castersrealm description would make them seem.

Somewhere else in this thread I proposed doing just that, going to places like
blackburrow or mistmoore where ludicrous trains are dead easy to come by.
That won't prepare us for the high level mobs that have better stun resists,
or are much better at stunning the chanters, or the specifics of pulling 50+
mobs
in a given zone without grabbing the unstunnable one or running into a corner
that
gets you dead... I expect deaths, frankly.

Unspoken Word is fast cast but has an outrageously long recast time, I
doubt I'll be able to cast it more than once per fight.  So its really
mostly upheavals I'll be putting out

Well you have 6 slots, the highest chanter proposal I've seen is for 3, there's
always (it seems, and certainly if I'm in the group) a cleric, so that leaves
two slots open at least.  Wizard for one slot, and druid plus cleric to make
up for the second wizard slot... and thats if we really have to have 3 chanters
which seems like serious overkill, most say two and some say one.

Currently considering

Cleric (me, so naturally always in any group I form)
Druid (my partner in 90% of my non solo EQ playing)
Chanter
Chanter
Wizard
Any puller

(any puller )have a lot to choose from and want to be able to get as many
guild mates some of the AOE gravy and training as possible.  Thus they
don't have to be Optimal.  I'm partial to Bard in theory as I see the added
mana regen in between fights as helpful, but perhaps I'm fooling myself and
that won't speed us up since we also have to wait for the mobs to respawn.

If the wizard of the day happens to have her epic and be pulling capable,
then we sub in "any PBAOEr" for that "any puller," again doesn't have
to be the optimal class for the job.

Are there any classes that wouldn't be covered under "any puller" or "any
PBAOEr"?
