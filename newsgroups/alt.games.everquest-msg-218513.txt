There's a lot of relatively simple ways around that. For example,
there's nothing stopping them from only using the characters within
the current range (58-65 at the high end) for determining the
difficulty level of the dungeon while still allowing lower level ones
to join. At worst, you'd get a dungeon that's too tough for the group
but them's the breaks if you go in with that kind of a spread. At
least it would allow you to get together a group of 5 lvl 65s and
still invite a lvl 55 friend along. Whether that lvl 55 is useful or
not is irrelevant.
