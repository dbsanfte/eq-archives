>1. Which one do i get and Why???? THe original or the expansions

 The original will give you just the basics, if you can get hold of the
trilogy, as this will give everything you need to get going properly and its
relatively cheap.
 The recent expansion - luclin, is very hardware intensive, check that your
computer can handle it. It is however a very nice addition to the game.

>2. I live in Sydney Australia. Is there any local servers to exist on??

 Antonius Bayle and Kane Bayle (sp?) are both European based, the rest are in
America. Check the server rules before you pick one as some have special
rulesets.
