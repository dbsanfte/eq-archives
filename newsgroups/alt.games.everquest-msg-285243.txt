A the entire ooc is a joke, of sorts.  And yet none of it is.

While Healer may imply the ability to heal others besides myself, (in 
which case its a joke, I haven't memmed dark empathy in ages but it was 
never a good heal plan, small, mana intensive, and self damaging) I use 
it here to mean I can heal the Tank.  My current lifetap is 406 points, 
bigger than the heal of a 52 druid or shaman, plus it damages the mob 
406 points... if I'm soloing (which is what room for 5 means) then it 
can heal everyone in my group.  If I'm not, well, it can heal the MT, 
and everyone else better not steal aggro!

In the past (back before the current Out Of Combat regen changes) I also 
used bandages a great deal, and found them very helpful in healing up 
group members or myself between fights.  Haven't touched the bind wound 
button, or even carried bandages, in quite a while though.

Some fights, my pet actually outdamages me.  He's hasted (level 60 
Augment Dead), wearing a muzzle, and engaging the mob from behind, while 
I'm wearing my regen belt instead of my haste one (FBSS no AC or stats 
at all) and facing ripostes parries etc, plus I often end up equipping 
my MOSS instead of my charred wooden rod because I need the shield 
bashes to interrupt casting.  Without clarity (curse SOE for taking 
clarity potions out of the game, as its one of the reasons I decided to 
go SK in the first place, knowing their relatively low mana requirements 
could be covered by potions) I DOT and lifetap as little as possible.

However, again I was joking, normally I do about twice the damage my pet 
does, its just disheartening to see the occaisional segment where he'll 
hit 12 times while I hit once, miss once, get riposted once, and spend 
the rest of the time casting shroud of hate or the like.

With clarity, my DPS goes up significantly as I can afford bigger DOTs 
and more lifetapping, meanwhile the pet's doesn't tend to go up at all 
in a group, as I can't convince people to buff him up... with the 
exception of a guild chanter with clicky haste and a guild shaman with 
clicky Carnage (avatar lite).

I can give you one other metric though; killing Coldain for their heads, 
and their wolves to help spawn more Coldain, we kill our targets at 
about the same speed.  If I end up with a swarm (which I do, 
deliberately), then I have to tank as my pet can't take a beating like I 
can, and doesn't have Lifetap to stay alive with (well he does have a 
proc but it seems to be pretty small).  At this point, his DPS is higher 
than mine, because those little buggers keep stunning me, effectively 
slowing me down, while he no longer has to face them, so his DPS soars.

BUT one on one he's a much better tank than I am in the long run, 
because his HP regen rate between kills is phenomenal.  Anything he can 
kill without dying, I'm better off having him solo it.  So I send him at 
any single mobs, and concentrate on running around gathering groups to 
up the kill rate.
