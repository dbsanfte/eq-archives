I've only been to the Allhazam site.

Near the registrar is an armory. Also, near Kagazz is another place to
buy smithing supplies and other armor/weapon things.

Hand it in and see.

My favorite little known quest is handing scorpion poison glands to
Animist Ragnar in the herbal shop. She gives a few pieces of armor.
