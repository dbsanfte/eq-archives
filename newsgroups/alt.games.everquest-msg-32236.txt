This seems to be the consensus.  I'll buy it, as you guys have been doing
this much longer than I.

I will get Dual Wield tonight, so I need to grab something like this.

find for now.

I have a Hemp Oak bow that I got from a friend.  I let him borrow all my INT
equip ( along with me buying all his supplies with my high CHA [ Chanter ] )
to crank up his fletching, so he made me that baby, and it's perfect for
pulling ( 21 / 65 / 125 ).  Once I hit 12th level, I started getting nice
critical hits with it.  I got 3 in a row, once - don't know if that's too
abnormal or not.  I did a favor for a guy, and he will make me a darkwood at
cost, but his fletching is only 192 or something.  I don't know if I want to
chance the $$$ on that, since I don't bow-kite or anything like that.  I
just pull with it.

I fletch for the hell of it.  I usually just make the cheapest arrows, but I
moved up to the medium nocks last night to advance my fletching a little.
My INT and WIS suck, so I'm not planning on being serious about it, but they
are so cheap right now, I don't mind working on it some.  My groups get a
kick out of my failure percentage while I'm waiting for the next pop.

Thanks to everyone for their replies.  You all have given me great
suggestions and I appreciate it.
