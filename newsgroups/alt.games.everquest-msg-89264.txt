I dropped two giants they other day, and both of them dropped 30ish
plat and a FS weapon.  From my observations, they tend to drop plat in
streaks.  You'll go for half an hour only getting 3 or 4 plat a kill,
then blammo, they all start dropping 30.

The only problem I see is that if you play during peak hours, Rathe
Mountains are way to competitive.  And if a necro is in the zone,
forget about it.  One high level necro and two high level druids can
keep the whole HG area totally clean.
