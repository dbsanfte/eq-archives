Keep an eye out for D&D Online then.

Well the problem is that with the vision, they didn't want your
Warrior to know exactly how good a piece of equipment was when he put
it on. Though honestly, I'd much prefer to know exactly how good the
equipment is, and how it will effect my character. (This coming from a
long history of Pen and Paper RPGs, where is you didn't know all the
numbers you couldn't play the game.)
