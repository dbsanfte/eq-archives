That's for sony's setup. I'm sure if you programmed it right, you could
host a whole wrold on a small box if someone was good at coding. If the
zone is idle, mobs don't need to be active. If no one is in the zone, no
reason to load it into memory. If you had a lot of people in your world,
I'm sure the requirements would reach a multi-machine size.
