Runes specifically are random drops off of mobs of the level of the spell to
be researched.

Although it seems lately that the runes have been dropping off of mobs a
full spell level higher than the research (29th level runes on 34th level
mobs for example).

There is no specific vendor for runes... the runes that you do find on
vendors are sold to them by players.  There is no specific quest to get
particular runes...

Er... well, there is a quest to get the runes to make the spell Ice Comet...
but if you're just asking about runes, then you're a ways off from worrying
about Ice Comet.
