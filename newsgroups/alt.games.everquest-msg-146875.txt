I swear, nearly every n00b that has begged me for pp has been a halfling.
When I go through Rivervale, it is like that part in the movie Airplane when
Robert Stack has brave through all the religious nuts. The latest thing
pissed me off.

Beggar: Do you have any items for a newbie?

Me: Hold on a sec. What class are you?

Beggar: SHM

Me: Here ya go! (gave Shiny Brass Shield)

Beggar: Do you have any pp too?

Me: You want money? Sell the shield.

That is the absolute LAST time I help anybody. Beggars can't be choosers.
