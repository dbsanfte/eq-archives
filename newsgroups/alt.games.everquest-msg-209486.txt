Our kick is that we and the folks we raid with are really and truely
casual.  We have virtually everyone quested in up to Tactics and frankly
the PoP casual progression hits a 10mile thick brick wall at that point.
We've been farming BoT 67 bosses for quite awhile now and that's getting
a bit boring (excepting when someone does something really stupid and
we manage to recover from it).  So for us, finding a reasonably hard
mob, that's virtually always up, that we can get into and learn the
fight at our own pace is really very enticing.  Some of his loots would
actually be desired upgrades for alot of our people, Cameo in particular.
But we also have like 4 pallys/sks who would love to have the back/shield
and that really silly 2hs.

There's a rather tepid enthusiasm for keying up for the Ssra named,
i.e. cursed, blood, al/hp, etc.  But those critters are still hugely
contested on Tunare.  Same goes for AoW/Tmax,  Tunare isn't often
bothered with because clearing Growth is really really annoying.  We've
done that once and about the most exciting thing was when in a fit of
insanity we decided to try and gank Ail...twice.  Frankly, if I never
have to go back to Growth again I wouldn't mind.  Pretty much the same
for NToV, after our first night wipe on Aary raid went back in the next
day w/o any warriors and like 22 people and killed Aary using a Pally as
MT.  Next time thru we go on past Aary, get like 1 or 2 Flurry's at
Dagarns spawn point and are killing them when Dagarn pops (that was
exciting heh).  Manage to kill all of that mess with maybe 2 rez ins.
We proceed to kill all the named down the right that night.  Nev would
have been killed first try 'cept one of the druids mashed inzone evac on
accident disrupting hugely the heal chain.  Recovered from that, whacked
Nev.  Everybody just tired and no Vyemm or triplets so called it an 
evening.  We might go back sometime and try Ring of Vulak but the
enthusiasm doesn't seem to really be there.  Much like for some of the
lesser SoL targets, we do hit Grieg every so often.  Dont' really have
spotters for the others IV, Shei, Rumble, Doomshade.  Rumble probably
doesn't live much since there are probably over 12 guilds VT capable.

Heh, back to PoP, we've done alot of the other events our access allows,
Mujaki, Falto, Ring of Frog in PoS, Hedge Maze,  tried a couple of times
with maybe a 2 group effort on the Hobgoblin Anguish Lord (HAL) and may
go back to him again one of these days.  PoI dragon is a pushover and 
is on farm/nothing else to kill status.  Paffa is doable and mostly
annoying.  The folks did try a Grummus run withing the last couple weeks
but execution was a bit off, could probably kill him.  We did recently get a 
few folks keyed for Saryn's tower and may go roam about in there and see
what's up with that, or try Terris.  Oh, forgot some tactics critters, Targin
is basically at the flawless kill point. Arm/Sup are one groupable,
even with just having a druid for healing. OS is a 1+ affair for us still
but very doable.  We haven't much investigated the upper wings but may one
of these days.

Couple of things on my personal hitlist that aren't listed above would be
Ring of AoF in CT (to just do it), Inner Acrylia Event (same), Veksar
dragon.

In many ways I think we are at the end of the line of progression in PoP
for us, due to playstyle and/or motivation and that's not a bad thing IMHO.
We find things, that we can do, can learn to do, that are mostly 
non-contested, and try to do them well so a mob like the 7th Hammer will
I think be really good fun for us.
