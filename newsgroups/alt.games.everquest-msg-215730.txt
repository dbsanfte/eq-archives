No, not on paper.  But clerics tend to specialize in Alteration, so thats
what, 10% more efficient, while many shaman specialize in Conjuration (for
the DOT damage, main mana expenditure of a soloing shaman)  And clerics get a
10% bonus to healing.  And clerics are more likely to have Improved Healing
items, due to the fact that they are more commonly focused on healing; thats
another 10%.  Casting the same exact spell a cleric is often 30% more
efficient than a shaman.  Plus clerics have HOTs now at very low levels,
which are certainly situational but can be superior to normal forms of
healing.
