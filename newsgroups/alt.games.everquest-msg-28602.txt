i have done all the quest for the avenger battle axe up to the Faldor
Hendrys portion where i have to camp him, i have been camping for ridiculous
amounts of time and no spawn....a few beggar place holders, but not even
many of them....i have read all the site posts about this part, but there
are too many conflicting opinions...so i had a couple questions
    1) does it matter if you camp in the room for him to spawn, one post
said not to as he would not spawn then, i find that hard to believe
    2) do you have to talk to the brother in Dagnor's to trigger the spawn?
i have done it, but with no better results...some posts say 5min after
hailing, some say 1-1 1/2 hours....others say up to 2 1/2 hours....
    3) is there an exact spawn time on him
    4) when a beggar spawns, does it mean that the time counter begins again
for another long camp?
    5) do the beggars just spawn at random in place of Faldor or is there an
order

    any help would be greatly appreciated!
