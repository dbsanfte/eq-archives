I am trying to figure out how to save enough cash to upgrade to a PC
powerful enough to play EQ2.  I can gardly wait.  I have been in EQ since it
went live.
Wife and 3 kids take lot's to support, but I will go on, I will succeed.
Failure is not an option.  Failure is irrelevent.
(Do not move, you will be exterminated!  Exteremiate! Exterminate!!)  sleep
deprivation setting in.
