Yes, as stated, I had a concern. So rather than assume anything I posed 
a question as to your intent.  You do know the difference between a 
question and a statement, don't you?  I didn't claim to know what your 
intent was, so in order to clarify, I posed a question.  Surely you'd 
rather I did that than to presume to declare knowlege of your intent 
when I had none.

Oh yes, you let it go hehe.  How big of you.  You were wrong and rather 
than accept that as even a possibility you continue to insist otherwise. 
  You let things go if you desire, or revisit issues as you will.  Just 
remember, I know your secret inner thoughts that lead you to act the way 
you do and often when reading your posts I giggle out loud at the secret 
we share.
