Hi ....

I've reached level 46 with my Wizard, and although I've tried to maintain
some degree of organisation to my spell book I always seem to end up in a
state of untidiness. I'm about to start a new character, just an alt to mess
around with, and I'm wondering if anyone has any tips on how to maintain a
well organized Wizard spell book. I have tried starting at the back of the
book and working towards page one, but this doesn't seem to work. Ideally
I'd like to have my nuke spells grouped together, my shield spells together,
ports together and my root and snares together - you get the idea  .. any
suggestions? I do know how to rearrange my book, I'm just looking for a good
system ..

Many thanks and safe hunting to all ..

Stevie.
