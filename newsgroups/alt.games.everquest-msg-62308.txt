    Kobolds in Sol B apparently see through Invis. My rogue can go anywhere
in the kobold areas of Sol B without detection, including the front arcs. I
can't verify that kobolds see through invis, but when I claimed they didn't
(based on my rogue's experiences) I was plastered here so I assume they do.

    Not off the top of my head (Hide IS supposed to be superior), but check
a rogue-written guide to Hate. Something in the back of my head tells me
that there's first floor mobs that see through Hide, but not through one of
Invis/ITU.
