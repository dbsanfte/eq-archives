No, your mana has to go where it will do the most good.  When things go
bad, that is not always heals.  When the aim of the group is "do damage
to these mobs until they die", healing is important.  When the aim of
the group changes to, say, "keep mobs from interrupting the Wizard so he
can get that Evac off", healing becomes less important than stunning or
other crowd control.  If the aim becomes "get the monk to FD and the
cleric to camp, so when the monk reports the mobs have left, the cleric
can res people", healing becomes irrelevant.

Healing is the main role of the Cleric when things are going normally,
or when things are slightly screwed up.  When things really hit the fan,
a good cleric knows how to use all those other spells.
