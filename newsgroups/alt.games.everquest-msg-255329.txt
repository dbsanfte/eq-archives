Do you plan on joining a raiding guild.
If so then dont bother with epic. Chances are youll be seing better drops
soon.

I solod much of mine. All the charm part I did solo. At 65 you can solo the
gorilla in FOB.
Plane of fear is really messed up with the ireblind imp tho, even if you can
3 box it which wouldnt be easy.
