So, given a choice between 49 fire pet (56 max dam, level 37-41)
or Voc. Earth (58 max dam, level 41-45), you're going to take the
lower leveled one?  Which does more damage, a level 41 fire pet, or
a 45 earth pet?  Level matters.  At 51 you *DONT* have 3 other pets.  
You have *ONE* vocerate.  At 52 you get fire, at 53 you get air
(all merchant  buyable) at 54, if you're truly lucky, you can buy
54.  Up to now it has been a *seriously* rare spell.
