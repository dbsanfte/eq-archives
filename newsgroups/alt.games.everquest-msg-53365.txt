Hi,

Could someone please help me out of my crashing to desktop nightmare? 
I've read thru the EQ FAQs to try to sort it out, which included updating 
my Nvidia drivers, etc., but it doesn't help. There doesn't seem to be a 
pattern to the crashes, as it occasionally crashes during death, or 
merely running to my next kill.

I have a Creative Geforce 2 GTS video card, & an old Soundblaster Live 
sound card, DirectX 8.0a. All my other games play solidly, no crashes at 
all. I've also turned the audio acceleration to minimum, but it doesn't 
help. Is there a certain Nvidia, or Soundblaster driver version that 
works best with EQ? I'll happily return to an older version if it'll 
help.

Thanks for any help!
