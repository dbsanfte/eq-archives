Try reading a thread that has gone on for a while, with mixed top posting
and bottom posting, with no one fixing the top posts.  It will be almost
impossible to make sense out of anything but the most recent quotes.  That
is the big problem with top posting--it disrupts threads.

The secondary problem with top posts is that people who top post seem less
likely to trim quotes, so a thread full of just top posters tends to have
posts that consist of a small amount of new material, and a huge tail of old
material that no one is reading.
