There are actually quite a few mobs that are easier to kill at range instead
of using melee. While martin disparaged our use of ranged attacks against
tallon ( also incidently against one of the cursed, one of the mobs on the
way to agnarr, and certain other rare mobs) they are quite usefull .
Paladins have some use for a bow assuming they have already emptied their
mana.
