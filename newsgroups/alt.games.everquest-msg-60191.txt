Have you ever died and been binded 2 hours away by running it you could make
it there at all or even stuck in a place that you can't get out of without a
port? Guilds are a family and help each other out even at a loss of hunting
time, more then once guildies have saved my bacon, as I have done for them.
Guildies are some of the best hunting partners because after awhile you know
exactly what they are going to do in a given situation. More then once been
groupped with my normal guild mates and know roughly how much mana our
casters and healers have and it seems when its time to make a run for it 3
or 4 broadcast go out at the same time.
