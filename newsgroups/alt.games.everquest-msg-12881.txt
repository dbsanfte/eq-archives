DUDE!

The problem is you are assuming the "all I want is a sweet guy" is
true.  Just because women chant it over and over like a mantra doesn't
make any more than a lie.

As a general rule, and yes, I know there are a *FEW* *RARE*
exceptions, women do not want a nice guy, no matter how loudly or
often they claim the opposite.

Men and women are very different.  It took me a long time to come to
the realization that there is no connection between what females think
and what they say.  

Go and be an ass (somewhere other than on this newsgroup (you had to
know that was coming) ) and study the difference in play you get from
the ladies.
