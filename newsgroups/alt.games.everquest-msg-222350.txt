There is a difference.

A fresh random for each item means there is a possibility of one person
winning all three randoms, something that is not possible with the one
random 123 method. The odds on recieving something in the roll is better
with your method, ie:

1/5 + 1/5 +1/5  Vs 1/5 +1/4 +1/3

They were just bitching because they were hoping for a reroll. Some people
will complain about any roll method used unless they win - in the hope of
forcing a re-roll in which they get a second chance of winning.
