Is there a list published someplace and I'm just too dense to find it?

A cleric friend gave me a manastone as a long term loan item since he
couldn't get it to work well for him. (Well, it works, but in the zones
we hunt in it took him longer to get someplace, use it, heal, etc. than
to just med.)

Problem is, even with my ability to port and use my wizard epic to soak
up the damage from the manastone, it's still a tedious damned process
that doesn't save that much time over just medding.

If I had a zone to hunt in where it worked *in that zone* I can see
where it would be a benefit.

For example, does it work in JPF? Anyplace except old world zones? *ALL*
old world zones or just outdoor ones? etc. etc.
