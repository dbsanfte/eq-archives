I wonder how many bards quit due to the physical strain.  Or,
at least, played less than they wanted to, due to the physical
strain.

That makes me wonder if, in some future theoretical EQ, bards
could still require skill and concentration, but still involve
less repetition.

only thing that keeps their over-powered-ness in check is the
physical demands IRL.

Hmmm, it sounds like you don't have much respect for the skill

P.S. Thank you once again for disagreeing with me AND being nice
