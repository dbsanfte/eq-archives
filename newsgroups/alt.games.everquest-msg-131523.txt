     thanks, one more thing to rule out; we have done everything but change
the power supply, however when I checked the motherboard CPU voltage at auto
it read 1.83 volts, but it should be 1.75; changed that; the SiSoft burn in
ran fine no errors there. Many problems have I solved, but this is by far
the hardest ~
