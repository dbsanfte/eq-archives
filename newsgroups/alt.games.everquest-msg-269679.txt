Neither would I.   As I pointed out, it *only* works for the level
10 books anyway.   As soon as you want to make something
which requires something higher-level you'll need a mule or
friend or money anyway.

But *right now* people can use that feature/bug/exploit and
make the subcomponents themselves -- which means they
can sell App3 scrolls for substantially less (3s) than someone
who has to buy them (15s.)

Long-term the "lone craftsman" will always have a much
harder time being profitable than someone with mules or
friend/guild associates.   EQ2 is a grouping game -- you
need a group to do much of anything useful, whether
fighting or crafting.   You CAN solo -- but you WON'T
be on a level playing field with groups.   The only real
difference is you can create your own crafting group
with only one account (even though you'll still need to
buy a few items since you're limited to 4 crafters.)
