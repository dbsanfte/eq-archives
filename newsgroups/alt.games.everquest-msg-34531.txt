Since the beginning, EQ mobs would respawn literally
like clockwork.  If you used a stopwatch to time how
long it took one to respawn after you last killed it once,
you could count on it respawning exactly that quickly,
no more, no less, every subsequent time (give or take
a few seconds due to lag server load).

A while back, Verant changed uber-mobs to be a bit
more variable -- for example, the dragons Vox and
Nagafen would respawn in one week (their original
respawn time), plus or minus about a day (at random).

I've now discovered that as of the last patch, in an
unannounced change, regular non-uber mobs are now variable
in their respawn times as well.

This means no more "camping by kitchen timer", and no
more spacing out the kill times on the mobs in a crowded
dungeon room in order to make followup spawns easier to
manage -- even if you do, the respawn variability might
make two (or more) respawn at the same time anyway
next cycle.

So be careful out there...

What we need to do now is to study just how variable
the respawn times can be, to determine whether there is
any way to adjust to the change and manage respawn times
anyway (within limits), or whether the variability is so
large that we have to be on our toes all the time and
always be prepared for swarms.

Actually, I'm surprised Verant didn't do this long ago
(I don't know why respawns weren't variable from day one,
in fact) -- it certainly makes more RP sense for a
monster's arrival to be less predictable than a
train schedule.  But I'm going to miss the old days of
being able to relax for a few certain minutes
between spawns, or knowing how long I have to go to
the bathroom and when.  The game will now be more
exciting and tense, but less relaxing and more dangerous.

I'm not sure if that's an overall improvement to
the fun quotient.
