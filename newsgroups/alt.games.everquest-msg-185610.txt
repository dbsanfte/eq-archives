The mem blur line has a god-awful recast time.  It has a better chance of
blurring (by far!) than it used to, but I've always found that simply
mezzing them wipes the hate list often enough.  As for being awakened and
going after someone...why aren't you rooting before breaking? :P  Rooted
critters always go after the closest player.

I'd love to use mem blur more often if they'd only make it viable to mem
during a fight by shortening its recast.
