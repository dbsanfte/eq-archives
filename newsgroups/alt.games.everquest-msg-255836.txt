Class Abilties you get to use at half the level of your current class.
i.e. if the ability of a Mage is L1 you can use that ability on a Cleric
when you get L2.  Going monk for Dodge is a great thing in fact getting up
to umm L8 or L10 to unlock the Ki ability is better (This unlockes a monk
skill to nullify a mobs next special attack).

Spells are restricted to the classes that can cast them and skill levels too.

BTW if you are on Twilight and need some armor look up Mothammad he's my
L30 Armorer/L30 Weaponsmith L23 Reaver Dryad.  He can hook you up with
Bronze stuff and some of the better Bronze tools as well.
