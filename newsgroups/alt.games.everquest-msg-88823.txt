Woke up this morning with a fuzzy memory of some dream/thought
i'd been having. Couldn't remember what it was but wasn't worried
because I knew it would still be in the message window and all I
had to do was scroll back and read it.

Apparently reality doesn't have a page-up key, hope we get a
new interface soon.
