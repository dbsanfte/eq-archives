Try doing this in Crushbone under the rock when everything wants to
attack you. I think I had five corpses in the water at one stage. Even
more advanced players were having difficulty locating my corpse. Sure
learnt to swim quickly.

Almost matched by dieing and falling into a wall with only heel showing.
To make it worse, this was up past the Eastern Orc slavers, a Lego and
Renton soon after the above. I think I only managed three corpses in
total before I managed to clean everything up.

Must be par for the course. Always interesting to count the corpse under
Kelethin. I did this as newbie bard to be able to find my way back. Real
bummer when everyone cleaned up their corpses and there was no corpse to
latch onto.

Now how many times did you agro the guards as a bard with Chords of
Dissonance? (lvl 2 song)  That is another rite of passage.
