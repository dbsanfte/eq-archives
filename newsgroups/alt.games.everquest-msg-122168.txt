You'd lose that bet, I'm afraid. The epic mage who I know on FV
hired lower level characters to kill whatever it is he needed that
was TLCed. No big deal.

TLC is a pain, but that virtually nothing is NODROP on FV takes
a lot of the sting out of it. Also, no planar items are TLCed
for obvious reasons (e.g. can't take a lowbie to Fear to kill 
the iksar broodling for you).
