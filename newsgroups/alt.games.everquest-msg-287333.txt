I thought so too given the endless parade of AoN's, auctions of epic drops 
from Fear, and the constant supply of Kunark era BPs, etc. All that stuff is 
coming from somewhere and I doubt it is all characters outgrowing it, etc. 
When my monk is older he might take a few himself and training him will not 
be an easy task.

I'm sure there are people who simply set a timer on mob spawns to farm them, 
park tracking bots, etc. There is good income in those things and they are 
easy to do if you have the inclination and time.

I do detest the farming and selling at high prices of epic drops. Quest 
items minimally should all be nodrop in my opinion so there is no purchasing 
an epic and there is no contention for mobs with epic drops except among 
those actually doing the epic.
