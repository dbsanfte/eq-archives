Flash of Light is about the only thing I can think of. Playing a rogue and
shaman 2 box, the shaman cannot keep agro, they do not have taunt, most
spells dont piss off the mob enough. I pull with slow, this usually lets me
get in 2 - 4 backstabs, DOT when it switches back, 1 - 2 more, FoL a few
times, maybe get in 2 - 4 more, when it flees easy then. Been this way for
almost 58 levels. Evade works to turn it sometimes, but never for very long.
Two boxing makes it a little easier since I know when BS is available so I
know when to cast the next agro spell.
