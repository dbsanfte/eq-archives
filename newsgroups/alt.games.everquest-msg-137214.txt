This is what the link says:

I�m not really sure where this rumor started, but there is talk about
town that we announced something called Exodus at E3 or that someone
heard from someone�s brother�s roommate�s third cousin�

The rumor is that we�ll be making one expansion after Planes of Power
and then folding up shop.

It�s not true. Not even a little bit true.

>OK , so it is true that they will not be making another expansion after POP, just like I said.

Sure, we�re known for our interesting expansion names (and acronyms),
but this isn�t one of them.

We do not plan to stop working on EverQuest until you folks decide
it�s time for us to stop. 

>If you beleive that it's up to "you folks" to decide your more delusional then I though.

It�s your participation in the endeavor that will keep us going. For
as long as you want to play our game, we�ll continue to do our best to
entertain you.
