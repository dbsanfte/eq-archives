In Terry Pratchett's "Discworld" series, there is a rather sharp point made by
Vimes about his men calling members of various races by nicknames - I think it
was in either "Men at Arms" or "Feet of Clay".

I may also be thinking of Robert Asprin's "Phule" series where one of the
non-coms referred to the Volton as a "warthog" and the two on hoverboards as
"slugs" - it's been a while.

It may be both.

Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that making nicknames for other races
is "in character" in a roleplay environment, IMHO.  Some of them may be really
stupid nicknames (in others' opinions), but it's not necessarily "non-RP".
