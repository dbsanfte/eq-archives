Been looking for some game mechanics specifics on Star Wars Galaxies. So
far I dont' see any Usenet groups available on the subject. The Sony
site has nothing but generalities on the professions and "hints" at the
skills etc. that might be required at character creation to take those
paths.

Also, no clue what all the "missions" might be. Single person or group?
Both?

It all sounds pretty cool, but there's no real details out there yet.
The beta has started, so I thought some more might be available.
