    Enchanters always wanted to be people who enchant magic items. It's been
promised since Beta. So far, the only way they've done that is through
Jewelcraft. Now that role is expanding - enchanting metals for cultural
armour, enchanting clay for deity-specific idols, and the mana vial series
of spells in Tailoring. They're finally becoming what they were supposed to
be.

    As are most of the Jewelcraft items, almost all the cultural armour,
almost all the pottery idols (especially since most enchanters choose
Agnostic), and a lot of the tailored items. Tradeskillers don't need to be
able to use what they make. I used to resent that enchanters were so
preferred for doing tradeskills, but now I realize it's part of what makes
them unique.

    Heh. They'd be killed by the brownie guards before they even got close
to the vendor at that level. And that's assuming they'd enjoy wiping out
their entire mana bar on a couple of casts of the spell, or had the cash to
not only make vials but get tailoring up high enough to have a reasonable
chance of success on Wu's. Tailoring is not for the faint-of-heart.

    Max out on the Crystalline Silks. Going from 131 to 158 on Wu's is bad
enough. And whatever you do, don't be like me and blow the TRIVIAL combine
on the fifth shawl after managing to convince a melee to help my lame cleric
self to farm the biles.

    Get the spells (have a druid help if required), then find the ENCH and
offer the spells in return for a few casts. Just be aware that the spells
cost a MASSIVE amount of mana for the level one gets them at, and it will be
very boring waiting on the ENCH to do 80 casts.
