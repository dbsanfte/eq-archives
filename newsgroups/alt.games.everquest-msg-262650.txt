It might end the current foreign terrorist problem, but it would have 
the opposite effect on foreign terrorism in general.

People do what works.

If terrorism works, then other people will use it to accomplish -their- 
ends.

This is the part of the "war on terrorism" that actually makes sense; 
its sort of crazy to make war on a noun, but it is logical to attack all 
sources of terrorism, and to never ever let terrorism work.

Bush, or perhaps its just Cheney, doesn't seem to get that, though, for 
they are currently engaged in attempting to use terror as a campaign 
tool; elect Kerry and we'll be attacked again.  Or how about If we get 
hit before the elections its the terrorists trying to help Kerry be 
elected.
