Just curious how it was being received since I had first hand input
into it for once. Not that I myself agree with 100% of the things
involved in it, but I was pretty happy for the most part with how it
came out.

For the record my two main complaints that were denied were:

1. I felt the Echos should have dropped six pieces, not one, and
2. I thought all six of the quests were too easy.
