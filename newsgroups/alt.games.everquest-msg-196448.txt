99% of the population decided to ban crack not use crack so your analogy is
dead wrong.  A more apt analogy would be if you thought that cars were a bad
thing for society because they make everyone rush around too much.  So you
try to tell everyone we should ban cars or reduce the speed limits to 30mph
max.  Maybe things would be nicer, but it is a choice that everyone gets to
make.  Not up to you.
