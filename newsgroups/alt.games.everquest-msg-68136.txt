Thanks for all the replies, everyone, and good to see you, Brad!

From a quick read it looks like the people who say life is good are mostly
running machines over 800Mhz/512Mb, a lot of them with 64Mb video cards.  

Sounds like the jury is still out on the models and socials.  Many people say
they can run with them, but some (including me) take a big performance hit.  I'm
guessing the performance hit is not due to memory though if you're over 512Mb.  

Oh, my configuration is Celeron 466, 768Mb RAM, GF2MX200.  Did a bit more
testing, in old world zones I get choppy when I turn on the new models.  In cat
city I have to turn the clip plane down to minimum to move.
