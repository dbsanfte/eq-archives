Yep.  KEI on lowers levels has had a bunch of bad effects.  I've had
the group cleric (!) gate out because she "had to get KEI", even tho
she was grouped with my enchanter.  What really blew me away was that
no one in the group said boo about this.

It certainly devalued lower level chanters.  And unlike any other
buff, it seems like some groups are starting to hold it against you if
you group and don't have KEI.  My feeling is that if I show up, and
the group wants me to have buffs, they can darn well buff me.  It has
really been bad news for the lower level groups.
