EQ and MMORPG's in general have a unique factor not yet considered.
There are quite a few people.. especially these uber guilds that are
considering WoW.. that while they say they are leaving.. most probably
aren't. They may not log in... but the time they spent on the char is
worth the $12.99 every couple of months to keep the account from
getting deleted.

I believe someone is truly leaving when they take every item on their
characters.. delete it in game.. get out of game... delete every
character on the account.. and THEN discontinue the service. Even
then.. sometimes I wonder :>.

If they don't... they're usually just hedging their bets and waiting,
unwilling to tank the items that took them so long to get, especially
if as advertised.. they may get some new benefit in EQ2 from their
legacy account. As such.. SoE still ends up getting quite a bit of
money from 'subscribers' who do not play the game and just use the
money to keep their items safe.
