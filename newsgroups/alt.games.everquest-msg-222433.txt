And then, to make your point about death not mattering at that
level, pull a mob, turn your back, and die smiling.  Come back,
loot up, and get back to work. 

In the long run, learning when a wipe is about to occur despite
your best efforts, and when and how to FD will mean a lot more to
your groups than anything else you can learn in Paladul.  At high
levels, "its ok, a necro lived" will be cause for great
celebration.
