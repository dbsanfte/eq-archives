LOL! OK, you are a more reasonable man than I gave you credit for. I 
have to confess I never would have imagined you to be in development 
yourself with some of what you were saying but perhaps that has more to 
do with our differing views and levels of patience with the industry.

Before I forget, the shameless plug was for Mozilla Firefox and 
Thunderbird, which I suspect someone such as yourself is already well 
aware of. I am on of those MS bashers who loves to see such superior 
products come to market and thrive. More power to all the good people 
who make Mozilla a reality. They do really nice work but again, I 
realize you probably already know that.

I forget now, but isn't TIN a Linux app? I ran Linux for a year and 
loved it despite it's growing pains as a desktop OS at this time. I 
loved using something other than Windows and was impressed by its 
stability and was already comfortable with UNIX from my work experience 
so it was good fun to have a real OS on my box at home. I could live 
with all the beta (or worse) apps for everyday things as a home user of 
the system and actually liked a good many of them. I ran Winex for 
gaming, which was a rather limited but neat bit of coding that would run 
a fair number of games. It even ran EQ in Linux although it was broken 
every time there was a patch. I think they renamed it to Cedega now for 
some reason. If it evolves into a library for porting that works well 
perhaps there may be a better future for gaming on Linux but as it 
stands now, it's just too much hassle and too limited so back to windows 
I came, where I can run my games with little trouble overall.

How's that for wandering way off topic? Hehe.

Anyways, as I think of it now it isn't hard to believe you are in 
development. I think some of software's harshest critics are those who 
develop and test it themselves. Did you ever read Code Complete by any 
chance? It was a good book in it's day, which was a long time ago now. 
It was fun to read about the disasterous projects and failures of 
Microsoft as they were working their way into the applications market. 
As I recall a lot of the book was, this is what I learned not to do.

 From something else you said though I get the impression you are in an 
area of the field where you are working within an IT group, perhaps 
developing inhouse applications for a corporation or something like 
that. I know that's just a guess but I had to wonder when you said 
you've never seen development that was not under the auspices of IT. My 
experience was in software development at companies where the two groups 
were separate entities, one of them being a company developing products 
for retail, Dragon Systems (speech recognition software). I also spent a 
long time in process control development and again, IT was a support 
service to us. If you think about it, for most retail applications 
including those that run on a network or even those that require one 
such as MMO's for users to use the product, it still makes sense for the 
two to be separate from one another. Developing EverQuest and testing it 
is really a separate thing from the day to day activities in managing a 
large group of servers. I cannot imagine EQ development working within 
the organization that keeps the network up. Nothing in my own experience 
would suggest that kind of organization.

In any case, my real point was just that if it's irritating you don't 
let it. Life truly is too short and precious, you know? I'm only human 
too and not above failing to remember my own preaching sometimes. But in 
general I honestly don't get worked up about this stuff. I've been 
guilty of arguing about such things though but I have to admit that on 
my part it was mostly for amusement that I ever did so.

I would still maintain that given the enormous complexity of such 
systems, even the best testing process isn't likely to ferret out every 
bug and sometimes major bugs are going to wind up being deployed. I know 
in a perfect world that shouldn't happen and I know that sometimes it 
happens because well established protocol isn't implemented as it should 
be in every case. In other words, I know it happens sometimes (most 
times?) because someone simply screwed up. But as you know too, those 
things happens in anything where human beings are at work. The art and 
science of software engineering continues to evolve and with it one 
hopes for improved stability over time. And we have seen that even from 
the likes of Microsoft. While I have no respect for them (well, thier 
management really), Windows XP is certainly a better and more stable 
product than Windows/286 was. But look how long it took them and it 
still has plenty of warts.

MMOs are still a relatively new thing and I'm sure those developing and 
testing them are learning plenty of painful lessons along the way. You 
know what it is to work hard and take pride in the code you write I 
would guess. I'm sure the team at SOE feels the same way, as does the 
group at Blizzard, etc. But in a genre of gaming this young we are going 
to see these things happen and probably more often than we feel is 
acceptable sometimes. I don't think there is much way around it though.

Your point about how the company responds when these things happen is 
well taken. But I would venture to guess people may have been in 
something of a panic when a disaster like that happens and they are 
scrambling to figure out what the hell happened and how to fix it as 
fast as possible. Unfortunately, with all that going on sometimes 
communication does break down. From what I saw in the link to the boards 
someone posted above, it seems to me they were trying to do a good job 
of keeping people informed on their site.

I know you like USENET and I know it would be nice to have such 
communication occur right in the game's startup interface. Let's hope 
that needed improvement comes in the future for all these games. But for 
now, I would say, bookmark the official site of any game you play 
because you are mostly likely to get the scoop there when something goes 
wrong. For now, that's just the way it is. Personally, if I was working 
for SOE I would advocate for the creation of an email alert system that 
updates users hourly whenever any unanticipated downtime occurs on any 
or all servers. I think such a system should also to be utilized to 
alert users to planned maintenance downtimes. I have to confess, I don't 
know how involved or expensive it would be to do that but the first 
company to do so will be the one to attain a higher standard of customer 
support and satisfaction in my opinion and I have to wonder if that 
wouldn't pay for itself as a result. Again, just my two coppers. 
Personally, I don't think it should be required of people to check a 
website often for such info even though I don't mind it myself.

 From all that I have been reading about WoW, it represents the state of 
the art in MMORPGs in terms of overall execution. I plan to try it 
myself. The only Blizzard game I ever played was the original Diablo but 
for it's day it was a good game and a lot of fun, simple though it was. 
Blizzard certainly does have an excellent reputation for producting 
quality games.

I love EverQuest and the fantasy world of Norrath with its rich lore and 
medieval fantasy setting. I enjoy the gameplay of it and I like the fact 
that even a cleric with the right gear and a bit of skill can solo to 
some degree at least. But as much as I like it, it does sound to me like 
WoW takes many areas of this genre to new levels in an evolutionary if 
not revolutionary way. I plan to see EQ2 for myself as well as WoW 
before ultimately making up my mind where I want to spend my time as you 
are. But realistically, where both are new I am expecting plenty of 
hiccups along the way in their first year. As you said yourself, my 
experience in EQ1 has been to walk into a world that has been up and 
running for over four years as of when I arrived. And for what is it is, 
they have done a lot right in my opinion. For me it passes the ultimate 
test despite the things I could criticize about it. It is fun, a lot of 
fun. It will be rare for me to play a single player game again. Although 
I doubt I will be able to resist The Elder Scrolls IV whenever it 
arrives. I loved Morrowind.

Something I think Blizzard really scored a big hit with is the concept 
of resting while away from the game. Have you read about or do you 
already know about that feature of it? I think it's great that people 
who have limited amounts of time to play will also be able to advance at 
a reasonable and fun rate of speed with this feature, even if they don't 
have the kind of time say kids who play after school do. For working 
adults who enjoy this kind of entertainment that is something to really 
be happy about I think. Hats off to Blizzard for coming up with that 
one. I hope the rest follow suit in the future. I think it opens the 
door for many more players who do not have 30+ hours a week to spend in 
a computer game to enjoy what this genre has to offer. Casual players 
have been waiting for something like this for years. I am very pleased 
to see Blizzard address it and in the way that they have. It seems to me 
like they took a hard look at the things that are not fun, annoying, 
etc. in this kind of game and tried to eliminate them as much as 
possible, while at the same time improving on what draws people into 
them in the first place.

As much as I like EverQuest and will probably like EverQuest II, these 
titles really require a lot of time to advance your character. For me 
that's not such an issue as I have a lot of playtime given my work 
schedule. But I hope SOE takes notice of this feature and adds something 
similar to their games. It's the kind of thing I think they all ought to 
have and which in my opinion would bring them all more paying customers.

Well, enough of my rambling. God, the way I go on sometimes you'd think 
the servers were down and I had nothing else to do, nevermind a real 
life. LOL!
