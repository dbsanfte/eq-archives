It would be messy. My name is on the accounts, credit card details, address
etc, but he could have cd keys to try to yank it back (original owner?). At
that point I would forward on CC receipts, emails and basically the whole
electronic trail to VI detailing the purchase through playerauctions citing
legal...blah, blah, blah (bullshit). At that point they would most proberly
throw up their hands, say "who are these F#@$wits?" and ban the account on
the spot.

Sure I could lose 150 odd bucks, but be danged if I would let him sell it
again or use it himself.
