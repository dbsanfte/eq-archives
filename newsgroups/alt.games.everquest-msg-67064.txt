I do have this problem. it only occurs though when the little pre patch
patchy thingy appears and starts doing nasty stuff to _verquest.exe. The
thing is to turn off zonealarm for a sec, get through that process, patch up
and turn zone alarm back on again, making sure you've checked _everquest.exe
eqgame.exe and everquest.exe as having permission to go through.

On a related note, zone alarm gives a pop up notice when it blockes
something. When playing EQ, this crashes you to desktop, this is not a good
thing. Uncheck the pop up alert in the alert section and bob's your uncle.

Good luck
