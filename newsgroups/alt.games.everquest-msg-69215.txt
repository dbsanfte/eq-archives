When I was doing it, any bear/wolf/rat that walked up the hill, into
the center of the ruin and froze at 6PM game time. It was almost
always a bear (thus the warning about Holly Windstalker). The
placeholder time may have changed and/or include a 4 PM bear, from
what I have heard from others. I was able to spawn Pyzjn fairly
consistently for several days (it appeared that even after a
placeholder kill, there was a chance that she wouldn't show up); it
took over 20 cycles of successful spawns for her to actually have the
GBS, however.

Still frequently camped on The Rathe, but the greatly reduced price on
the GBS is why I haven't bothered in a while.
