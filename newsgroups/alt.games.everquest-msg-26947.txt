Right.

Check.

Here you're heading out on thin ice.  By your reasoning,
"egiillmnpss" is a "misspelling" of the word "misspelling".
I doubt you could find 2 out of a hundred "men on the street"
to agree to call it a "misspelling" as opposed to a "rearrangement"
or "anagram", if they're familiar with that term.

And is "Old West Action" truly a "misspelling" of "Clint Eastwood",
even if it is an anagram?  *Really*?

Yes, according to your dictionary definition, transposing
letters does change the spelling (by definition).  But does it
necessarily mean that the result is a "misspelling" -- or at
times another word (or name) entirely, correctly spelled?  Or
even a nonsense word ("egiillmnpss"), which can't truly be
said to be "misspelled" at all?

Your dictionary correctly says that transposing letters
changes spelling, but it's silent on the issue of whether
the result is by definition *misspelled*.  That's your own
leap, unsupported by your dictionary.

I stand by my claim that to lump spoonerisms, anagrams, and
every other form of word-mangling into the category of "misspelling"
makes the word meaningless.  Stretching the definition of the
word "misspelling" to include such operations takes it so far
that one could claim that "disenfranchise" is a misspelling of
"intuition".

"Misspelling" has a more narrow meaning than that.

Your declarations of proof are premature.
