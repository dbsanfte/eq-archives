Oh, come on... Are we going to reprise that long profanity thread? I'm 
in my thirties, and I had a good hearty laugh at that, not a snickering. 
People use profanity *because it's enjoyable*, amongst other things. A 
barrage of profanity can be immensely funny (just watch Joe Pesci in 
Goodfellas or Casino), and mixing profanity where it doesn't seemingly 
belong can have tremendous comical effects: Profanity and religion in 
this case, profanity and news in The Onion, or even profanity and 
organic chemistry in one web site that I wish I could find now. Me, I 
found that reworking of the Ten Commandments *both* clever and creative... 
Whether it belongs in a family-oriented group like a.g.e, where people 
are always so mindful of never hurting other people's sensibilities, 
it's another matter.

You're your own person, and it's not my place to tell you to lighten up, 
but don't assume that we all share the same prejudices.
