I'm pretty sure (as in, I just saw them today) that you can buy these
three drinks in East Freeport, in case an aspiring brewer feels like
staying in Freeport. I'm currently at 113 skill, so I'm still making Ol'
Tujims myself :).

Also, it is worth noting that you can easily go from 135 to 148 (or
whatever the trivial is) making Double brewed Dwarved Ale before moving
on to the Faydwer Shaker. Sometimes I make a couple stacks worth of this
in between stacks of Ol' Tujims just for variety and to see what kind of
skill ups I'll get.
