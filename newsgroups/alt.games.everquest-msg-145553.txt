I should probably put 'in my opinion' in that post.  To me that just 
removes all the fun of getting a last name at 20.  Okay, sure, I haven't 
taken a last name yet, but still.  That was a big reward.  You got a 
last name, and you put lots of thought into what it was.  Only now... 
you don't.  So 20 doesn't really have that "ooh, shiny!" feeling 
anymore.  For me, at least.  *shrug*
