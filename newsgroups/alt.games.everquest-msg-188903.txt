Went to GD and there was a ring war going on.  So I stuck around to watch
and see if I could get some cov faction without being a nuisance.  I noticed
there was a bard doing something to a coldain.  I think she was mezzing him
because the message was "Corbin Blackwell blinks and falls to the ground".
Who is Corbin Blackwell and why did he need to be mezzed?  Didn't want to
possibly mess with the raid by asking noob questions in the middle of it,
but now I don't find anything on him at allakhazam or Illia's bestiary
either.
