I have a lvl 57 druid and I couldn't be happier about the PoP port!  Woot!
Guild was doing shammie epic in the Hole the other night and I didn't have
to leave to get late comers.  We lost a PvP battle in GD and I didn't have
to port all over hells half acre for CR.  I am one happy druid.  Hopefully,
the PoP portals will make it so 95% of the new players won't make druids
simply for the fact that they can port.  Now, if Verant would just put in
sow/soe givers, life would be perfect.
