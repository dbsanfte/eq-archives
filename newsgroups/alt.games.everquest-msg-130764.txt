I had this discussion with another guy a few months back..  You are a
LOT more intelligent then he, but you still got it wrong.

1> The Liberty was a US Naval vessel. By definition, a military vessel
2> It had the capability of discerning Israeli military plans and pass
those on to the enemy.
3> The attack on Pearl Harbor was also a legitimate military target. 

War sucks, no doubt about that.

Logically and rationally, I can understand the attacks.  The fact that
I think they were brutal and viscious, is an emotional response and
not relevant to the logical side of the argument.

Oh I agree. 

It WAS an act of war.

However, you are incorrect. It was a legitimate target, due to
circumstances.  The US was just beginning to buddy up to the Arabs.
It was the Israeli fear that the "buddying up" would extend to giving
vital military info.

Exactly...  It was a legitimate military taget as it, from the Israeli
perspective, it endangered an Israeli military operation.

It was war and we became part of it when we sent a spy ship into a war
zone..
