  I don't think you're the only one having this problem.  I usually
don't pay much attention to problems other people are having unless I
know for sure I can help them, or am having the same problem myself, but
I'm pretty sure that you'd have better luck on the official EverQuest
tech support message board
(http://boards.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro) than
you would asking here and petitioning.
  Good luck finding some help with your problem.
