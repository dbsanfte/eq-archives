Gotta be Flame Lick.  Tangling Weeds scrolls are Ranger only, Druid
can't scribe it even tho it shows as Druid usable in the spdat.  (I
think I read somewhere that it was available to Druids briefly just
after SoL came out, but at any rate it's not available now.)
Pull with Snare (Ensnare if the mob'll live too long for Snare) and
use Flame Lick to keep hate high.  Not that I've managed to produce
any corpses that didn't bear a remarkable resemblance to me in wolf
form using this method.  But I've been told it works very well if
you know the pathing, don't have a laggy connection, and can stand
the tedium.
