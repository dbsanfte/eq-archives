My druid is level 38 and unbuffed has just over 700 hps. (He is in very bad 
equipment, but not so bad as to be an unreasonable comparisen of HPs)

If a level 34 druid had 1200 hp he was either sporting some very high level 
buffs (likely) or Twinked to hell and back. Either way not really a very 
fair comparisen.

About at level 30 through 35 you stop fighting (melee). From then on life 
as a druid is all cast cast cast. You just have to learn to manage agro 
etc. and med when you can. Swinging your club is pritty much a waste of 
time from now on.

HTH,

Jim
