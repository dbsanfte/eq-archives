}>Im a level 10 ranger and new to everquest. This is my first week playing and
}>im trying to level.
}Welcome to EQ!!! Getting to level 10 your first week playing is doing
}great!

Just be warned... Dying is about to get messier.  Over the next two 
levels, you are going to discover the joys of the 'corpse run'.  I can't 
remember the order, but (a) you are about to have to recover your corpse 
(you will return to your bind point, but -without- your precious goodies 
that you were carrying) and (b) you will start to lose experience when you 
die, approximately 10% of how much it took to get the previous level.

}>I am looting in black burrow and cant venture far by
}>myself. 
}Join a group of players near your level. You can type into the chat
}buffer " /OOC Level10 Ranger looking for group" without the quotes.
}(/ooc means out of character)

You can also venture much farther than you probably think.  At level 10, 
you should be able to make it across WK, to the spires in NK, which will 
facilitate your journeys around the world (assuming you have the Luclin 
expansion.  If you don't, you may be able to get a port from your friedy 
neighborhood druid or wizard, although that can be quite expensive at your 
level.)  I think rangers get the camouflage spell at level 9... this is a 
very handy spell, especially for travelling.  Just watch out for skeletons 
and zombies!

}>I watch some hit gnolls for 30 and 40 damage, one guy
}>for 110 points of damage. 
}Were they using a 2-Hand Slashing weapon (higher damage, but longer
}delay between swings)? Were they "twinked" (using awesome  weapons
}that are intended for characters much higher in level)? 

Actually, the characters you are watching must be significantly higher in 
level.  There is a cap on how hard you can hit before level 10, and 
another until level 20.  I can't remember the exact formula, but both of 
them are less than 40 points.  So that guy hitting for 40 points (much 
less 110!) has to be at least twice your level.  A fair number of fairly 
high level players wander around blackburrow, because they want to improve 
their faction with the surrounding communities.  They may also be working 
on quests in the new fairly high level zone that opened right next door, 
Jaggedpine Forest.

}>In 2 days ive accumilated 22 plat. I think I am missing something, does anyone
}>have any idea what I can do better?

That's a lot of money at your level!  Good job!  And it may sound strange, 
but value your poverty.  As you get higher level and get more resources, 
I've found I actually miss back when it was a challenge to make my way in 
the world, and every little bit seemed to count.

}You are doing fine. You are not missing anything. Relax and enjoy the
}game. Levels and gear all come over time. It takes a long time to
}advance in EQ. Enjoy the journey, make some friends, and don't worry
}about how fast you are levelling or getting gear.

Very well put, that. :)
