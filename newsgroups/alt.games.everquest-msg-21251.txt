Use your Level 1 Siphon Strength spell on orcs the lowbies are killing.  
Ask permission first, and explain that siphon str does no damage, thus you 
will not be stealing exp from them.  It's also a very low mana spell so you 
can cast it pretty much indefinitely.  I've never had a problem allowing a 
highlevel to get their faction hits from what I'm killing, because they'll 
help out the group if things go bad.

"Atrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike, by all
who learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no
mitigating argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past.
Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-
perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
