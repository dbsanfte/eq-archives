I never have a problem with sharing. If im  camping a spot and antother 
person comes along i will usally ask if he wants to group or  split the 
spawns. The way is see it, you offered to share the mobs with him. So  i 
would have told him to get lost. As for as his guild, screw him and his 
guild, who cares its a FREAKING GAME.
