See, what I'm thinking of probably would affect pathing, and may also
effect some other things.  If they smooth out a zone, they'd change
the geometry of it also.  Admittedly, this would be slight, but it
would be enough that it may cause clipping issues, or allow for mobs
to get 'stuck' in areas where the new zone and old zone are no longer
the same.

Not that a lot of the old zones couldn't use a little cleaning up this
way anyways, but it would most likely have to force everyone to the
new zone to prevent exploiting and other problems.
