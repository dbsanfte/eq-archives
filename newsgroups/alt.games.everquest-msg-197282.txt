And that my friends is the problem with my fellow Americans - "I don't
have a clue what I'm talking about - but my opinion is as good as yours!"
Wrong - if you have no knowledge base to work from (in this case it is
readily apparent you do not) then your opinion isn't as valid as that
of people who do have that knowledge.
 
You've never been in a trial, you don't know what it takes to beat one,
and you've never seen how divisive it is in a guild to have some
flagged and some not.  An awful lot of guilds simply can't manage to
flag members that are marginal in the trials - they may be able to
muster a perfect group of 6 to get through the trial - but take one
of those people away to make room for that lower DPS class to get
through and the group can no longer complete the trial.

1 group at one time for a trial - no more than 6 people in
the trial chamber *PERIOD*  - only the people who originally
entered and triggered the trial can get the flag (this was
fixed - used to be you could sneak in behind a successful 
group and take any of the tokens they left unlooted).

4 waves of 4 mobs (this is execution)
the moment the wave spawns the executioner
starts walking toward the prisoner, in <30
seconds he'll get there and kill the prisoner -
*YOU FAILED*  Every time a mob dies, he starts
his walk over.  About 30 seconds of rest between
waves.  After the 4th wave a boss mob spawns
that hits for >800 and mitigates slow (it has
a lesser effect on him).

I tried over 20 times one day (fortunately it
was a week day/non-primetime and there wasn't
anyone there who succeeded - you can't attempt
the trial for 30 minutes after someone succeeds)

This group had a 62 warrior, 61 shaman, 60 cleric,
61 mage (me) and the other 2 varied.  That group 
was able to keep a steady pull rate of level 58-62 
mobs that hit for 500+ going in a camp in PoN -
we were NOT poor players.

After a few false starts we consistently got to
the end of the 4th wave before failing.  I'm far
from uber - but I pulled every trick out of the
book - I was at 3300mana to start, I took a hit
from  my rod after the 1st 2 nukes, then took one
more just before the 4th wave.  I was on a horse,
and we'd payed for KEI/POTG/SP - my total mana 
regen was 46 mana a tick for ~60 ticks.  Given that
I had my 61 air pet (that does 60-70dps against
that level mob) and my general >3:1 damage to mana
ratio - conservative calculations say I did 
>40,000 damage over the course of these trials.
Unfortunately I was always dry for that damn last,
or 2nd to last mob in a wave that wasn't going to
die in time and needed a nuke *NOW*.  This was
because there were too many times in prior waves
when I needed to drop an extra nuke to keep from
losing then.  

If we'd just gotten lucky and picked up another
serious damage class, I think we would have made
it - but where's the room to bring in a class that
can't contribute 40k in 6minutes?  Do we just leave
those marginalized classes behind so we can go on
to tier 2?  That was the crux of the division in the
guild.

Funny thing is, as a mage I could have probably 
succeeded if I'd just looked for a group of the right
makeup (not from within my guild though - we didn't
have the right classes in the 60+ range to do it).
Tank/Cleric/Enchanter + 3 wizards or mages can own
those trials - it's the group my prospective new 
guild was thinking of putting together to get me
flagged.

And I do take offense when people tell me I should 
leave friends and guildmates behind and move on without
them because they happen to be of a class that will
take a borderline trials group and render it unable to
succeed.  They never left me like that back in my 40's
when the common perception was that mages weren't a
good group class.
