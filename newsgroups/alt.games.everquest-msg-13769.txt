Actually, that is slightly in error, there are several models of the
M-16 around, some have full auto, some 3-round burst (which is still a
version of automatic fire in my book).  I do not know which model is
being issued at this time, but I seem to recall that there was a great
deal of upset over the "no autofire" thing, and that the next issue of
the M-16 had automatic fire as an option.  

Plus, the three round burst is still a very deadly option, giving the
damage capabilities of full auto with the accuracy of semiauto.  Not a
bad choice, I'd say.

I suppose someone could kill that many people with a .22 lever action
that fast... anything is possible.  I tend to agree that it'd be
pretty unlikely.  22's really don't have a lot of punch, for all that
they are STILL dangerous and shouldn't be treated lightly.

A more valid comparison would be saying "I could do as much damage
with a lever action .223 hunting rifle."  That'd I'd believe.

(and yes, I know that Taras was not the one making the claim about the
.22 rifle.  That was StannMann)
