Yeah, but you're weird :)

I would say you are exactly the wrong person for WoW - you don't do
things by half measures and there is no leisurely stroll through the
game for you.  All the things they put in place to make it easy for 
more casual players (casual in attitude, not time availability) make 
it too easy for hardcore players to cap out, look around and say "Oh,
I've done all there is at the moment - time to find something more
challenging."

I'm sorry, we're talking about someone who doesn't even fart around
when twinking - 1800HP on a new paladin?  My mage had 1800HP when he
first hit 65.

I, on the other hand, am probably the exact person they're looking for:
I am in no hurry to get to the top, but when I do I'd like to check out
the raids.  Furthermore I don't have the time I used to have for EQ 
(and then I could only raid 3 nights a week).

I don't forsee ever doing everything WoW has to offer.  Developing my
mods and my current time constraints have put me far enough behind the 
advancement curve that I will likely never catch up to the content.  In
some ways this is a little disappointing, in others heartening.  It's
nice to know that, as long as I enjoy the gameplaye there will be things
I've never done to try.
