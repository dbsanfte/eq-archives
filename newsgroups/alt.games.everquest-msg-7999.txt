Making something that has been in the game this long LORE would
be a huge, huge mistake. Its a good idea but its too late now. You
would have to make the item PENDING LORE and announce in
the news messages, over and over and over again that this item
is going LORE. They are just too many people out there with
more than one to make them *poof* , You would still get people
that would bitch up a storm because they came back to playing after
a 3 month break to find 90% of their stuff gone.
