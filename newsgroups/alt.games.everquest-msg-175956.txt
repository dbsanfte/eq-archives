Well, if you check your local Bazaar you should be able to find these
weapons fairly cheap:

Runed Totem Staff   2HB HP+5 Mana+5

Although you will have to work on your 2 hand blunt skill to use it well.
You should also be on the lookout for one of these:

Dagger of Marnek INT+3 Mana+15 Nec only

The good thing about this weapon is that you can put it in your range slot,
and still benefit from the stats.
