 Opps!  Posted a reply without typing anything!  Sorry 'bout that!

What I was going to say was somewhere along the lines of ...
"When my first couple of characters started, I was afraid to take them past
West Karana until they were in their lower teens.  I kept both of them to
Everfrost, QHills, Blackburrow, and the Toxx until about levels 12-15.  Now
I regularly use level 1-3 mules to explore lots of dangerous territory."

I find that level 3 characters (untwinked) make perfect explorers.
Paladins have lay-hands, which is nice for helping you make those
short-distance get-aways to the zoneline.  Clerics can get Divine Aura at
level 1... eighteen seconds of total invunerability, perfect for that dash
through or fall into certain death areas.  Some races of Rogues get
sneak/hide combo at 1st level.  Rangers get tracking, which helps them see
what's around them without having to get too close.

And at level 3, you have somewhat decent hp's so you don't die in just one
swipe (often), and yet you still get your newbie weapon and food when you
respawn.  As long as you don't have some hard-earned (or twinked) gear on
you when you die, you can just forget the corpse run.  :-)
