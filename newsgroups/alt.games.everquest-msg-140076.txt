My brother and I are looking to join a certain guild on our server and they
require us to do some "tag-along" raids to get to know us first which is
great.  My question is that we are doing the Kael Arena and I haven't really
done any "real" raids before so I'm looking for some tips.  I'm a 51 Ogre
Shammy with fairly good equipment (I have 3 peices of Jaundiced armor with
right clicky STR, DEX and AGI in my inventory also), there will be at least
one 60 Shammy there so I'm not sure my role.  Up until now, my brother, a 47
DE Warrior, and I have partnered so Im used to slowing the mob as it's INC
and then debuffing it and healling tank as nessessary.  I buff him up prior
to pulling too. Any tips that you can post to make sure I don't do something
stupid and get the whole raid party killed would be greatly appreciated :)
and which spells I should keep up and who should I buff (my group or
everybody).  Thanks in advance.
