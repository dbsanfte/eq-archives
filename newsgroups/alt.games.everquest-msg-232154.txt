Er, who, here, in a.g.e compared him to a god, hmm?  Have any specific posts
you can point to?

And even then, so what?  People who say "so-and-so is a god" don't literally
mean that so-and-so *is* God - merely that they've accomplished admirable
things that set them apart from most other people.

Don't be so freakin' literal.  =)

Oh, it's Tolkein btw.
