I recently had this problem pop up myself.  I decided to try a
reinstall but being the way I am I had to mess around a bit
first.  That ended up being a good thing because I found that
my UI files for a couple characters were corrupted.  I deleted
the bad files and all works fine.  You lose your window
placements and everything but if it fixes the problem it's well
worth it.  Hope this helps!  Now I just need to figure out why
when I loot certain items I get serious packet loss.
