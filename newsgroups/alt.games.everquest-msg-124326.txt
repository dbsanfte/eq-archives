It's a shame. Due to your rather "unique" circumstances in evolving your
character, you missed out on one fo the finest and most fun dungeons in
the game.  You went from eternally guildless and hoping for a pickup
group in Seb straight to ooooberguildness and  worrying about how to get
into VT.

Howling stones is a GREAT zone. It's also a prime grinding and loot/cash
generating zone for guild xp groups. (From the non uberguilds, that is.)
The xp is outstanding all the way to 60, (at least according to some
sixties I've run into grinding down there.) the loot can be pretty
damned impressive and valuable to sell, (unless you are in the
aformentioned ooooberguild_01 and "above" that sort of thing) and it's
just a really fun, well layed out dungeon. Kind of a pain if you don't
bring a rogue, but we've done it without one and still had a grand time
in there.

If you can find a few other bored people 55 to 60 who want to go grind
AA some time with you, you really should try it. Everyone should see HS
once at least.
