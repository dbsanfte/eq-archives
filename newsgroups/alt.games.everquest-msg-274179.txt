Last Updated: January 31, 2005

Latest Changes:
* Added question about re-using disks to create a new account.
* Added tip about "/lootnodrop always", especially on LDON collects, to
  reduce the risk of accidentally looting augmentation items.
* Added mention of shift+delete to erase an entire line of typing.
* Updated definition of "No Rent" to reflect that containers no longer go
  away if anything's inside.
* Added definitions for "Attuneable" and "OP" (original poster).
* Corrected mention of Enchanter's "slow" to note it tops out around 70%
  instead of 50%.

If you see any errors or invalid links in this FAQ, or if you want to submit
content to be considered for inclusion, please contact the current Keeper of
the FAQ, Don Woods, at age-faq@icynic.com.  I will edit submissions as I see
fit for correctness, size, or style.  I will not add any in-document credit
for any work submitted.  This is not because I am ungrateful, but because
this FAQ is the product of many different people, over a very long period of
time, and I am simply unable to track them all down to provide proper credit.
It just doesn't seem right to give credit to some people and not to others.

A short list of changes still in the works:
* Moving some of the more detailed questions into sub-FAQs on various
  topics: LDoN points, LXP, AAXP, Tasks, Tribute, PoP flags, PvP, etc.
* Better organisation of the glossary section (suggestions welcomed).
* Adding class writeups currently missing from the Grouping 101 document
  (contributions welcomed).

1.   General Questions

1.1  Q: What is the FAQ for?

A:  This FAQ is designed for a newcomer to the game and/or to this newsgroup.
It attempts to answer some basic questions about the game, but owing to the
complexity and depth of EverQuest, it is not possible to answer all queries.
If you have a question that requires more detail, there is a list of URLs at
the end of this document that you might like to visit.

1.2  Q: What is the newsgroup for?

A:  For the discussion of all things related to the game of EverQuest.  Other
online games are occasionally mentioned, but generally only in passing or for
purposes of comparison.  The particular "other game" called EverQuest II is
considered on-topic for now but this FAQ does not cover it; see section 7 for
more on this.

1.3  Q: I think something in the FAQ is wrong.  What should I do?

A:  The current keeper of the FAQ is Don Woods, which is to say, me.  I'm
relatively new to the game (started in late 2003) and don't have any really
high level characters yet, so I rely on community input to help me come up
with answers.  If you see something wrong in the FAQ (or just have a
suggestion for an improvement), the best way to let me know about it is
either to reply to the thread that FAQ was posted to, or to send mail to
age-faq@icynic.com.  If you send mail, please include FAQ or EQ or EverQuest
in the subject so it'll be sure to get past my spam filters.

1.4  Q: Where can I find the FAQ?

A:  A text version of the FAQ is posted to the newsgroup once a month; the
subject will always be the date of posting, but the "Last Updated" line will
show when significant changes were last made.  The FAQ is also available as
a web page (with active links to answers, etc.) at
http://www.icynic.com/~don/EQ/age.faq.htm.  Copies of the FAQ are also
maintained at http://webpages.charter.net/lenny13/age.faq.htm and
http://www.derfy.net/agefaq.html.

2.   Questions about EverQuest

2.1  Q: What is EverQuest?

A:  EverQuest is a real-time 3D massively multiplayer online role-playing
game (MMORPG) run by Sony Online Entertainment (SOE).  Another equally
accurate way of describing EverQuest is to call it a graphical MUD.

2.2  Q: What do I need to play the game?

A:  Ideally you should check Sony's web site regarding system requirements,
since they are subject to change as the game evolves.  But here's what Sony
said as of fairly recently:

Minimum Required Specs:

* Windows(R) 98/2000/ME/XP
* Pentium(R) II 400 equivalent or greater
* 256 MB RAM
* Graphics card: ATI Radeon 7500 / NVidia GeForce 1 equivalent or greater
* DirectX Compatible Sound Card
* 28.8k + Internet Connection
* 4X Speed CD-ROM
* 500 MB Hard Drive Space
* DirectX 9.0
* EverQuest Classic and a valid EverQuest account
* Note: Not all Direct 3D cards are supported.  See site for list.

Recommended Specs:

* Windows(R) 98/2000/ME/XP
* Pentium(R) 4 equivalent or greater
* 512 MB RAM
* NVidia GeForce 3 / ATI Radeon 8500 equivalent or greater
* DirectX Compatible Sound Card
* 56.6k + Internet Connection
* 16X Speed CD-ROM
* 2.5+ GB Hard Drive Space
* DirectX 9.0
* EverQuest Classic and a valid EverQuest account

Note that your graphics card and system need to support Direct X 9.0,
and that Windows 95 is no longer supported at all.

You will also need a valid credit card, or a pre-paid game card.

2.3  Q: What are these expansions I keep hearing about?

A:  Expansions add new content to the game: new locations, new quests, new
monsters, new skills, and also new user interface features.  If you want
access to the new stuff, you have to buy the expansion, but you can also
keep playing the game without the new features.  Like the original game,
you only pay once for the expansion; your monthly fee doesn't change.  Some
boxed versions of EverQuest (e.g., EverQuest Evolutions) include many of the
expansions as part of the package.

There have been eight expansions to EverQuest so far: Ruins of Kunark,
Scars of Velious, Shadows of Luclin, Planes of Power, Legacy of Ykesha,
Lost Dungeons of Norrath, Gates of Discord and Omens of War.

2.3.1  Q: What is The Ruins of Kunark?

A:  Commonly called Kunark, The Ruins of Kunark was the first EverQuest
expansion to be released.  It included a new continent with many new zones
to adventure in, with lots of new dungeons, items, mobs, quests, and spells,
plus a new race that players could choose to play, the Iksar lizard-men.
People with this expansion also were allowed to advance beyond level 50 (up
to level 60), which was previously impossible.

2.3.2  Q: What is The Scars of Velious?

A:  Commonly called Velious, The Scars of Velious is an expansion similar
to The Ruins of Kunark, including another new continent with new zones,
dungeons, items, mobs, quests, spells, level 60 cap, etc.  However, it
was geared towards higher level players (level 30+) and did not include
a new playable race.

2.3.3  Q: What is The Shadows of Luclin?

A:  Commonly called SoL or Luclin, this expansion added new zones on the
moon, including new hunting areas for all levels, and four new cities.  It
added the beastlord class and a new playable race, the Vah Shir cat people.
It added Alternate Advancement abilities as a new way to spend experience
(especially for characters who were already at the level cap and thus could
not use experience to gain levels).  It also added the Nexus spires to
somewhat facilitate transportation, The Bazaar as a place to trade items
with other players, and new, more detailed player character models.

2.3.4  Q: What is Planes of Power?

A:  Commonly called PoP, this expansion raised the level cap to 65, greatly
expanded the Alternate Advancement options available, added the ability to
form raids of up to 72 people, and added a very efficient transportation
system, with direct teleportation between the Plane of Knowledge and most
major cities.  It provided additional hunting grounds for levels 46 and up.

2.3.5  Q: What is Legacy of Ykesha?

A:  Commonly called LoY, this expansion added expanded bank space, in-game
maps, armor dyes for all slots that show a graphic, the story window, a log
journal, Frogloks as a playable race, and a few new hunting zones for levels
40 and up.

2.3.6  Q: What is Lost Dungeons of Norrath?

A:  Commonly called LDoN, this expansion provides "instanced" dungeons.  An
instanced dungeon can be accessed only by the group that activated it.  To
activate a dungeon, the group must have at least 3 members, and the members
must all be within 7 levels of each other.  For example, a group that had a
20th level member and a 27th level member could get assigned a dungeon, but
they could not include anyone who was 19 or under or 28 or over.  Dungeons
have missions that must be completed within 90 minutes, or 120 minutes for a
lesser reward.  A win or partial win grants each member a number of Adventure
Points that can be spent in the Wayfarer camps (which is also where missions
are assigned).  Also, monsters in LDoN dungeons drop Augmentations, which
can be used to add stats or abilities to armor and weapons.

2.3.7  Q: What is Gates of Discord?

A:  Commonly called GoD, this expansion adds a large tradeskill-oriented
boat/city zone, as well as the berserker class, plus normal and instanced
zones aimed at characters level 50 and higher.  It adds a "tribute" system
where one can trade plat (game money) or items for buffs by talking to an NPC
in the player's home city.  It also adds "Leadership Experience", wherein
the leader of a group of three or more members, or the leader of a raid, can
choose for 20% of the experience they earn to be diverted into Leadership
Points, with which they then purchase various abilities that enhance the
performance of people in their group, including later groups.  (Only members
who also have the GoD expansion get the direct benefits of the group leader's
Leadership Abilities.)

2.3.8  Q: What is Omens of War?

A:  Commonly called OoW, this expansion raises the level cap from 65 to 70,
and adds new zones for the high-end crowd.  It adds quests for upgraded
"Epic weapons", voice macros, more Alternate Advancement skills (including
one that will provide an extra spell slot, and ones that let players have
more active buffs), new player titles, and a "task" system which is a series
of specialized individual quests geared towards characters of most levels
(with varying degrees of success).  It also expands the tribute system from
Gates of Discord to let tribute be shared by all players within a guild.

2.4  Q: What is EQ Macros and where can I get it?

A:  EQMacros was a program whose purpose was to provide a way for users to
circumvent some of the more tedious aspects of the game.  It also dispensed
with some character disadvantages, such as night blindness.  Third-party
macro programs, such as EQMacros, tend to be frowned upon by both SOE and
a large number of players.  Therefore, they will not be discussed in detail
in the FAQ.  This is a controversial subject in this newsgroup, and has been
argued to death.  Posting questions on this subject is generally frowned
upon.

2.5  Q: Where are the EverQuest servers located?

A:  The entire EverQuest universe (at present, 50 separate worlds) is run on
approximately 1,000 servers.  These are located in an onsite datacenter and
at AT&T CERFnet (in San Diego).  The Antonius Bayle server is located in the
UK.  The servers Kane Bayle, Venril Sathir, Kael Drakkel, and Sebilis are
located in Europe.

2.6  Q: There are so many servers!  Which server should I choose?

A:  For the most part it doesn't matter; the game is the same on all of them,
except for a few special servers.  Characters generally stay on whichever
server they start on (moving them costs real money), so if you have friends
who are already playing, you may want to play on the same server they're on.
All the servers, wherever they are located, tend to have players from all
parts of the (real) world, but depending on where you are you may find that
some servers have more or fewer people playing at the same times you do.
(More is usually better!)  The most recently added server tends to have a
slightly higher concentration of novice players and somewhat fewer top-level
characters, which has both good and bad points.

Incidentally, the servers tend to be named after deities and other major
characters from the game.

2.7  Q: What is the newest server?

A:  The last server added was the Morden Rasp server added in February, 2004.
This server allowed transfers from other servers from the very start, so
never really had a "virgin" economy.  The last server added that did not
allow transfers is Stromm, added in May, 2003.  While this server's economy
was not "contaminated" by an influx of transfers, it has had enough time to
be considered mature.

2.8  Q: What are the special servers all about?

A:  The special servers include EverQuest Legends, Test, the Zeks, and
Firiona Vie.  These servers have different rulesets or conditions that
change the gaming experience to varying degrees from the regular servers.
In general, all the special servers have lower server populations.  Your
regular subscription fee lets you keep characters on all of the servers,
regular or special, except for Legends.

2.8.1  Q: What is EverQuest Legends?

A:  EverQuest Legends refers to the Stormhammer server, a premium service
server which costs $40.00 US a month to play on.  The special features of
this server include Character Pages, which are personal homepages featuring
all the character's statistics and items.  Also included is a personal
journal, Legendary Items, Interactive Maps, Guild Halls (a website including
a guild calendar, message board, member roster, and pages for guild news and
history), and increased dynamic content and customer service driven by a
great presence of GM and support staff.

2.8.2  Q: What is the Test Server?

A:  This server is designed to be a place where the developers can see how
potential changes to the game will work when regular players interact with
them.  Players on Test often get to see new developments to EQ before
people on production servers do (if the changes get implemented at all).
They also play on the most unstable server available.  The Test server is
frequently taken off line, with and without warning, and there can be small
rollbacks where minutes or hours of gameplay may be undone.  Also there
is a chance that SOE might elect to do a total character or equipment wipe.
To date, there has never been a character wipe, and there was one total
equipment wipe.  To access the Test server you must go into your EverQuest
folder and run the application TestEverQuest.

2.8.3  Q: What are the Zek Servers?

A:  These are the servers in which all players are subject to Player versus
Player (PvP) gameplay as well as the Player versus Environment gameplay.
The server names are Sullon Zek, Rallos Zek, Tallon Zek, and Vallon Zek.
Many people love the PvP experience, while others hate it and consider the
inhabitants of the Zeks to be among the worst of griefers that EQ has to
offer.  While it is up to the new player to decide their feelings on this
matter, many would consider it a good idea for true new EQ players to get a
handle on the PvE aspects of the game before also having to deal with the
added challenges that PvP presents.

2.8.4  Q: What is the Firiona Vie Server?

A:  Firiona Vie is a "roleplaying preferred" server.  This server has
several special rules including a limit of one character per account (when
people say they have more than one character on FV this means they have more
than one account), Trivial Loot Code (TLC) where if a mob is green to anyone
in the party that killed it then any loot tagged Lore or Magic disappears
(poof!), a lack of No Drop items that extends to nearly everything in the
game save for certain high end keys, most Grandmaster Trophies, and Epics
and Epic drops, and a lack of Common Tongue (each race starts with their own
racial language, and Common is replaced with Human).  The old rules about
alignment grouping restrictions and language learning have been lifted.
SOE doesn't enforce any roleplaying rules, though several members of the
server do with varying degrees of commitment.

2.9  Q: I bought a set of EQ disks and created an account.  Can I give the
        disks to someone else so they can create an account, too?

A:  No.  The disks let you install the game on any number of computers,
but to play the game you need an account (the station name and password you
use when you log in).  To create a new account you need a special "code", a
string of letters and numbers that came with the disks.  Each code can be
used to create only one account.  You can use the account from more than one
computer (though only one at a time), so if you go to a friend's house you
can bring your disks, install EverQuest, and log in and play using the same
characters you play at home.  But to create a separate account, with a new
set of characters, you must pay for a new account creation code (e.g., by
buying another set of disks).
