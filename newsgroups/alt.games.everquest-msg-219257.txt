Given your penchant for attention to detail, I'm sure you won't
mind me pointing out that a 20/40 weapon with 20% haste becomes
(effectively) a 20/33.3 weapon, not 20/32.  I'm not sure where you
get 20/40 + 40% haste = 20/19, the actual effective ratio would be
20/28.6.  Haste percentage is an increase in the number of attacks
over time, so the proper computation is not (delay - haste %), but
rather (delay / (100 + haste %)).

As for the Mithril Two-Handed Sword, it is a 21/40 with 31% haste,
giving an effective ratio of 21/30.5 (with the damage bonus of a
40 delay weapon).  Compare to a Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword with
an FBSS (24/39 + 21% haste) at 24/32.2 and you can see why the M2H
at priced at fire-sale levels (the difference between 39 delay and
40 delay damage bonus is not greater than one until level 51, both
of these weapons are long obsolete by then).  On top of that, as
you point out in some of the text I'm about to snip below this, the
haste from a non-weapon piece of haste gear applies to any other
weapon you equip (and to Slam/Bash/Kick/Archery) as well. I chose
the BABS for the comparison because it is so cheap to buy it might
as well be free.  There are 2handers with ratios in the vicinity
of 30/40 that are exceedingly inexpensive as well, and they blow
away the M2H when combined with the FBSS, which was also chosen
for its low price andready availability.
