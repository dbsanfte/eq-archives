>Sounds like there will be more of a chance to get xp soloing

I think they've doubled it. Just happened to play my lvl 11 paladin
before the change and he was getting 1/2 exp for a green spider in
forest ruins. My lvl 11 gnome is now getting 1%. Given that and the
fact she could take out some yellow and even orange solo mobs means she
is going to race up the levels much faster then the other chars.
