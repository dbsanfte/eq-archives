Looked up the slow spells on lucy, both the enchanter and shaman line use 
magic for the resist check with a zero modifier.  The only thing that 
should affect resists would be debuffing of the mob, and the level and or 
buffs on the caster of the slow.  This is not counting the shaman disease 
based slows, they are different, as they check against disease 
resistance, but are generally only used on mobs that are too hard, or 
impossible to slow with magic based spells.
