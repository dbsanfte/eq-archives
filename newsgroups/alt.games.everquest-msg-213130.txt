Bush has proven time and time again that the Constitution is nothing
more than toilet paper to him. He insists on attempting to putting
"God" back into the government, and he has made no secret of his
prejudice against non-Christian faiths.

The man has no grasp on the true concept of Democracy. Frankly, I
think it's no coincidence that the state that had a huge mess in the
election and eventually won him the presidency just HAPPENED to be the
state that his brother was governor of.

I do not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any 
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.

-- George W. Bush, October 15, 2000 

(Notice how Bush does away with the Wiccan's right to religious liberty
by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with 
the term witchcraft.)
