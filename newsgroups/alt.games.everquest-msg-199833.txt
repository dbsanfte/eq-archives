LOL

This is getting more fun by the day..

As i said, it is meant as a RAID buff originally.
If you want to waste your time (as you put it) buffing everyone who asks you
for it you will be loosing alot of mana and time.
If it (your time and mana) is so precious to you do NOT offer your services
as a public buffer. I never said I begged for it, if you go back in the
thread and read what I said I am happy to DONATE out of free will but not to
be forced to PAY.

And you call me a buff beggar? What do you base that accusation on, really.
I am a warrior and I can do well with what my group can supply me in the way
of buffs, I do not go around begging for Aego. I have some caster alts who
occationally get KEI should they be nearby anyone casting it, and I donate
if the person casting does not demand payment, then I go on my way instead.
