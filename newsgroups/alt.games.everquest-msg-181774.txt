MGs in DL are pretty good once you get Drones at 34.  Steeps will be
difficult and Patriarchs impossible but you can do the Braes and Craigs.
They sometimes drop weapons and armor that can give upwards of 60pp.  Maybe
even get a Forest Loop.  There is a large flat icy area between the MG Fort
and the little MG hut to the SE where you can pull to and MOBs rarely enter.
Don't go in Wolf form though.
