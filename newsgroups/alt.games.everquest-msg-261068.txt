i had a similar problem.  i deleted the files and repatched.  i got into the 
game, and i didnt even think about all my settings getting nuked.  i went to 
change screen resolution from 8X6 to 10X7, but i accidentally clicked the 
wrong one.  the screen flickered like it normally does, but when it came 
back my chat windows and boxes and stuff were all transparent with no 
outlines, and my mouse was frozen.  30 seconds later, crash to desktop.
log back in and everything looks good, except for the resolution.  its now 
at hte wrong one i clicked on.
i go to change it again, sure to click on 10x7.  the screen comes back 
jacked and frozen agian, and im back to desktop.
i run EQ again, and im crashing at login again.
delete the files again, and i log in at the correct resolution with no 
problems.
hehe this expansion BETTER be worth the problem.  i spent like 3 hours 
tuesday night just trying to log in, and an hour last nite restoring my 
settings!  ;)
