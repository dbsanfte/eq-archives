Its "recipee's" for spell research.

A number of your spells for each level, once you hit 16th, will
be "research only." which means you can't buy them in your
guild.  Oddly, you will find you can buy many of them at
shadowknight guilds instead... since SK get pretty much your
spells only several levels higher, and since they never get
research, there they are.

To actually make the spells, you'll need a Tome of Dark Bindings,
and then you'll need specific words you will loot off of mobs,
or buy off vendors where people have sold em, or trade/purchase
from other players.  Which combinations of words make which
spells?  Thats what the book you bought tells you... or you can
look it up on the web.
