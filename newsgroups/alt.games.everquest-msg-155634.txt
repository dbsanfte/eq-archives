I've been very happy with the robe of enshroudment.  Um.  But I suck at 
necroing, so what do I know. :)

Thanks! :)

Er... If you want, I'd be more than happy to forward your mail from my US 
address if you win...  I'd do the same for any of you other non-US'ers 
too.  Personally, I'm annoyed that the contest is functionally not open to 
users of Netscape 4.xx. :)
