I just recently learned about the Mino Ribcage and I think I'd like to pick
one up.
The mob sounds like no problem (18-20ish) but I've no idea where it is.  One
site said it spawns towards RE a couple of corners away, while a friend says
it could be anywhere in zone.

Anyone have first hand experience?
