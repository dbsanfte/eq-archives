I just grouped for a few hours earlier this morning in Paladale Caverns.  I
went from end of LV18 to about 2 bubbles into 19, then grouped and got up to
1 bubble into 21.  I've now got my LV20 spells scribed and am looking for
some hunting/spell advice and strategies.  Also any advice for LV24-27 would
be nice for when I get there.

About a week ago I got some advice from an Iksar Necro.  We were discussing
"too many mobs fighting my pet, time to run like hell" tactics.  I said that
I usually stand around until it looks like my pet won't live, and then try
to cast gate to get out of there.  He reminded me of feign death and that
not only do you not return to your bind point (and have to run back to your
hunting area), but your pet doesn't instant die (so IF he does finish that
kill before dieing you get the EXP), and it only takes 1.5 seconds rather
than 8, so you are more likely to get it off during an attack.  Just after
saying that something happened as if in a comedy scene.  A train of those
recondite ran to us.  He began casting feign death, I started casting gate.
The next part of our conversation involved me being asked if I needed to be
drug to the zone line. =(  Point taken.
