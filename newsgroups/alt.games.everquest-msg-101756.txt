Go with the resist gear.
Fight AT THE DOOR.  Do NOT let anybody talk you or the other melee into
rushing into the lair and fighting there. Otherwise, many *will* be
feared and run into the lava. Nasty CR.
Don't let your health go below 60%. When you reach 60%, run screaming
back to where the clerics are waiting hitting your hot key you will have
ready which says "/ooc DanielMolnar Incoming... Needs a HEAL PLEASE!"
Run back to dragon. Rinse. Repeat until dragon dies. Roll high on loot.
Go home.
