It is not about being ask for the buffs, but, HOW they are asked for.
Politeness and patience helps.

There are players that insist on being real "dweebs" lacking in socials
skills to no end.

As you say it is a circle of life, one that I believe in, in RL.

If faced with rudeness or uncivilty the circle continues and will return to
the originator. That is Justice.
