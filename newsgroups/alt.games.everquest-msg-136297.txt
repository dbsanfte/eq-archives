Not quite, actually, not to be too nit-picky (since *you* seem to be
able to read, unlike some people around here).  What I meant was that
EQ was deliberately acting in a way that would result in personal

Just wanted to clarify.  Not fault of yours if the meaning was
unclear, this thread has not exactly followed a logical flow of
conversation!
