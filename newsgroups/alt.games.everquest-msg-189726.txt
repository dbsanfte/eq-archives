You CAN get to the point where a non-Inny worshipping SK can train in
Neriak. My CT worshipping Ikky SK can train there. Took a lot of killing of
the Elf casters at the TL spires, but all things considered it wasnt to bad.
I also did the wine quest with Breear, and hes actually max Ally to the
merchants in Neriak. The undead guarding the entrance to the necro/sk guild
are a pain but ivu does work against them, and after a while they simply
wont aggro on you. I believe I was like level 35 or so when that happened.
They still hate him but arent agressive towards him.

Now the Cleric guild, and all the guards near the temple... Well thats
another story. I have to Invis up and run through that area on my way back
to the SK guild. If theres some way to improve THAT faction Id LOVE to hear
it.
