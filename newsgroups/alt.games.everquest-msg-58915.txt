I started in FM at lvl 26 soloing the Bruts. Just inside the zone from the
Lake of Ill Omen take a right and follow the zone wall till you come to a
rock. You can sit up on this rock and take out anything that walks by. You
are still very close to the zone line incase of an add or bad pull. I went
to 30 at that point in 2 days time.
