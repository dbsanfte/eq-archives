Rumor going around now is that in future server merges, all guild tags
will be stripped so everyone will have to reform new guilds after the
merges. If this is true, it will royally suck.  

Oh and another rumor that another round of server merger is on June
10th.  Still no idea what in April or if any merges are planned in
May.
