It is annoying, but astonishingly cheap; costs 25pp to make, my gnomage 
brought along a backpack full to any raid and just handed them out to 
people who had nothing, no charge.

Reason its annoying, for the uninitiated, is that the effect Telescope 
is a vision buff which makes things look much closer than they are.  You 
can get used to that... but when using it as a buff protector, it gets 
dispelled, and you put it back, and it gets dispelled... annoying is an 
understatement.  As a caster, you can get away with just looking at the 
ground, I can't imagine as a melee.

Grim aura thingie, see invis thingy (latter is bracer of the hidden, 
forget the earring's name but I think it has Grim in it)?

Don't make the mistake someone did of using an invis clicky... works 
great as long as you don't want to attack or cast spells, but if thats 
the case why are you there?

My berzerk has a clicky Fungal Regrowth item that's instant, but since 
thats a primary slot item which pales compared to his current weapon, 
its not very handy; I used it for a Vox raid recently, sort of like a 
bard, keeping it on my cursor, swapping with weapon in primary, 
clicking, and swapping back; that didn't cost me much DPS but it was 
annoying.

I'd love to see a list of other insta click alternatives, particularly 
Berserk usuable ones of course.
