Yagh...  I personally play a 31 Druid... and there's only one real point in
a group that I will melee... And that is if we're battling a blue,
everyone's in no danger of dying, and I need to work up my 1hb or
something...  Otherwise, in groups, I tend to fill one of two roles:

** Groups without clerics:  Primary healer...  stick my nose in a book and
heal when necessary.  Snare mobs when needed.
** Groups with clerics:  Snare/Root, dot, occasionally nuke... backup healer
in case Healer is OOM.  Also root mobs off the healer in case the healer
accidentally aggros.

In both cases, if necessary, I'll harmony (especially if we don't have a
monk that can FD pull - but then, I'm almost always grouped with one monk in
particular... :) )
