I haven't tried this, but in Kunark (and Velious?), where mobs give up
pursuit fairly easily if you get far enough away from them, this should
work:

	1. Root or snare a mob.  Rest of camp runs after you.
	2. Run away!  You should have SOW or jboots for this.
	3. When you get ahead enough, root or snare another.
	4. Run some more.
	5. Repeat 3 and 4 until only one is following.
	6. Keep running until you are far enough away from the last
	rooted or snared one that it won't follow.

Anyone know if this works?
