Thats what many people are expecting - to feel like theyve been
dropped into a star wars movie, and may feel dissapointed when they
are essentially that character in the background you see for a split
second sitting on a curb.

There are (or will be) "Uber" items. To not have them would be
rediculous. The method of attaining them may be different - but I have
a sneaky suspicion that eventually there will be some "uber" type
drops. I know that they say the best items are player made, but they
will eventally want to give the players options on how to obtain
equipment. If the best stuff is always purchased from a player, where
is the challenge in that? Ok, theres the challenge of getting to the
ability to make it, but the end user doesnt really have much to do to
get it. They can just run around doing (mindless) missions up the
wazoo until they can afford an item. Which is more rewarding for the
average player? Doing mind numbing missions to be able to purchase
that item from player X, or putting your characters life on the line
and battling for that item?

Everyone who plays an online game wants to progress and become better
and to be recognized as progressing. It doesnt necessarily mean they
are egotistical or self centered, but just about everyone wants to see
something to make them stand out of the crowd. If everyone always
appeared to be a newbie, many would get frustrated and leave.
