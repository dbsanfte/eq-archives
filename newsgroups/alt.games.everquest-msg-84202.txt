If you like.

You have seen how the original post was treated by others, I know, you've
replied to them.
I don't particularly like seeing the XX is better than XY posts, no matter
how they are worded, had my fill when Q3a and UT were released with months
of each other.

I don't remember disagreeing with what he posted, just why he posted. As I
also said, if we hadn't had so many pro DAoC posts here that just appear to
be trolls others he probably wouldn't of received the reception he got from
some.
Other than my facetious questions at the end of my first reply, I don't
think I offered anything that could be considered warm, let alone a flame.

If you wanted an explanation for that sentence then there you are. If you
wanted me to bite, then bad luck, it won't happen.
