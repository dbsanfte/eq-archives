Hey All,

Was trying to remember what I had in the bank the other day.

What are the pros and cons of an in-game Bank Book feature? It could occupy
an inventory slot and right-clicking would list the items you have in the
bank. I'm not asking for an inventory screen, just a text list.

The first person who says 'write it all down in a notebook next to your
computer' gets my copy of Myst:Riven thrown at them.
