Level 54 Enchanter, Arbiters of Ec'i.

Plane of Fear run: Is it broken by the japanese last night? Then wait
4 hours till it starts to pop. If not then finish the break and then
wait as the kiters bring stuff in.  Since there are two higher level
enchanters with me who already have their epics, I do clar 2 while
they do speed. Their mezzes overwrite mine. I end up sitting most of
the time and catching their resists. 

Dragon necropolis Run: Deal with initials, skirt the traps, get an
add, deal with it, run some more, run some more, finally get to a
place where I have to keep two separate mezzes memmed and the resists
are so insane I end up dying lots, all for what? The place has no
caster loot. 

Zones in EQ I haven't seen: less then 5.

Corpse recovery in Sebiliss Juggernaut room from wipeout? 2.5 hours.
Sitting. On my ass doing nothing. 

No thanks. I prefer to play on my terms not be restricted by the
threat of losing all my items unless i sit on my ass for hours while
the raid recovers.
