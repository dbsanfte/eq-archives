Wrong. Plenty of people care about the naming rules. Verant does (except
when no GMs are on hand to veto the idiotic names at creation) as they
are the ones who instituted the naming rules in the first place. All the
people I know who report offensive names on Prexus (myself included)
care. Some of us like the fact that we aren't running around in a
virtual world full of -=-=SuXXOrMan69=-=- and bAbeeKilllrr (like UO and
Diablo), and by taking idiotic names that violate the rules, these
people draw attention to themselves. Some of us are going to report
them. These names grate on my nerves as much as people who call Clarity
'crack' (note to idiots: I am not paying $10 a month to roleplay a drug
dealer).

I've probably reported about 10 names in the 2 years I've played. I
report the offensive ones (reported Twatboy and Biggdikk and a couple
others I don't recall) and the supremely idiotic ones (the ones that use
several words in a single name) like Wantsomedrinks. I generally don't
report the bazillion Ggandalffs and Drissstzzzts or whatever the
unimaginative people use.
