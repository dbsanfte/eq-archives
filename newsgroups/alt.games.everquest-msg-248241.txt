I have to disagree and say it's on topic, because my ISP says problems with
everquest aren't their responsibility to fix, and if my packet loss doesn't
stop me downloading email or browsing, then they won't investigate. I don't
know if that's standard but i have heard that a lot. ISP's seem strangely
unaware that a lot of internet use has nothing to do with either. I read one
report that world use of email went down last year, due to spam making
ordinary emails difficult.

I want to play everquest, I need a working connection with an ISP to do
that, and I've seen other arguments about whether a video card is good for
everquest, and whether it's the h/ware you need or the ISP, it's all about
the game in the end... it's not alt.games.everquest.US.users.only :*)
