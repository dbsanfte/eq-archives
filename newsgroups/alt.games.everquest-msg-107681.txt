That's Ridah (he's on our server too). I'm only a usenet warlord. I
have an hierophant though, resting easy in retirement, only usually
coming out to kill skellies in Umbral Plains now when I have an urge
to feel the druid power once more.

I would wager quite a few people here have 60s now.

CONGRESSMAN:  "These reports undoubtedly prove that your product makes
    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
