    Some of the past rewards I can remember include the Qeynos artifact
shield that had some profane AC, the Flowing Thought 10 staff, the awesome
BP with the regen effect handed out in the "purify the Karanas" event, the
permanent raising of a person's Magic Resist to 90 in the Mayong Mistmoore
event, the right-click Gate to Nexus necklace, and even "little things" like
the insta-cast GHeal potions I picked up when a guide had a birthday and
played Hide-And-Seek in Freeport. Not all rewards are a hug and some gnome
sandwiches.
