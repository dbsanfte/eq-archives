We set up in the room everyone uses (has couple of frogs in). We use bind
sight to see when Port and trak are away from each other and pull prot to
the room and kill him. All buff up and med to full. DMF on all and PR gear
on. Bards singing PR etc.

When Bindsight shows Trak has moved to the left of the lair we move to
"cubby" after bridge and get ready. You can use a pally with DA to go ahead
and pull trak to left, so Trak is facing wall. As charge is called I cast
Aggro + on MA (Ma has rune on) and runs in with a cele heal on him. everyone
is running in with the MA but MA leads. MA runs in and aggroes. Around 1
maybe 2 seconds later all the melees pile in with DMG+ disc on, MA has
defensive. At this time ALL casters nuke for their worth. Trak dies around
4-6 seconds from MA engaging. Helps if you can get a Wizzy to Manaburn at
start as that's 25% of traks HPs gone.

When you could MB freely we killed him without him getting a single AE off
hehe.

You beat this dragon by overnuking and hope he dies quickly from it.
