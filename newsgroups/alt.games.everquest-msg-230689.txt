Useless even in the trials.  Resists are atrocious, mana cost is
exhorbitant.

With my BL I tank in GE - what I do is have all the pets /pet guard in
the same spot, pull to them, then circle strafe the mob.  All pets do
better on the back (as do all melee) and they can stack on one another.
Add to that their very large melee range and I can usually create space
for a couple of melee behind the mob so it doesn't get pushed sideways.

Having spent so much time (as a mage) wondering why MT's don't just spin 
the mob, I now know:  They're lazy.

The problem is part level and part melee range.  Shaman pets (and necro
pets) engage from closer in, which causes mobs to prefer them.

Check out my post in your thread about epics and their current usefulness -
the airpets stuns are effectively a 20% slow on mobs they land on.

He's already outclassed by GV pets - MSIII never got the pet upgrades that
GV, BL and Necro pets got.

SoFB shouldn't be compared to SoS or SFoS - it is a fire based DD - 
the comparison is to Char.  I still haven't gotten my upgrade to this
(Sun Vortex) and still use it in xp groups on MR mobs.

BOV is an EP spell, very cheap and easy to get, I sought out mages 
approaching 61 and handed them my dupes.

The only higher level spell that really outclasses it (IE: is a fire
based DD and does higher damage at a better ratio) is Sun Vortex.  I've
never seen SV for sale, the other rune spells for a mage run 30k.  I've
lost every roll I've ever had on runes (over 20 now, I lost count).

TER is a Malo like spell - rare drop or research with rare components.

Mage heals are F'd up - something we demonstrated to Rytan on the Tower
(quite convincingly I hope).  He promised to get back to us on it after
the holiday.  Planar renewal heals too little (compared to what we're 
fighting) and has a cycle time of 14.5 seconds (without a haste ring).

My BL buffed, equipped 61 air pet has around 4800hp, PR only heals a
quarter of his HP.  If my pet is only losing 25% of his HP every 15
seconds then he likely won't even need a heal from me before the fight
is over.

I don't know where everyone sees 1250 - it's 1200.  Even mages doing
posts on the Tower write that.  Makes me wonder if they actually ever
heal their pet and see the message that clearly states 1200 pts.

The whole issue of pet survivability is one we're hammering the devs about
right now.  We are the single weakest (defensively) pet class, and our 
tools to sustain our pets are absurdly weak compared to the DPS they face.

With the pet-canni nerf and the obvious focus from SOE on sustaining pets
rather than chaining them, I think we're in good position to get better
heals and/or other pet survivability fixes.

Of course, my pets almost always face 50% slowed mobs, just as my BL is
slowing mobs that are almost always 'sini'd.  But, in the larger picture,
most mages aren't always partnered with a BL.  In fact, if you are (and the
pets are tanking) it's better for the mage to turn taunt off and go with
a water pet.  

BL pets hold aggro more reliably than any mage pet short of the epic, they
mitigate as well as Air and BL's have much better heals (and access to 
healing AA's).  That leaves the mage's mana free to nuke with.
