i think they are wussies. its like the rich kid who's daddy bought him
a porsche when he turned 16 and got his drivers license. i earn every
last drop of gold in this game why dont others do the same? i can
understand that if you have a 43rd level wizard and a 12th level
warrior and the wizard kills a monster that drops a good item your
warrior can use....i guess thats twinking. I can understand that
people are going to transfer it and use it but i still dont respect
them for it. it gets damn frustrating to see so many people skate by
with good equipment while youre stuck with the task of cutting down
the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring.
