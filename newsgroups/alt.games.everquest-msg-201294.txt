Hummm, Sense of community you say. OK..... WHy don;t you offer KEI
free of charge?  How about AEGO???  People are everywhere refusing to
cast those buffs without a donation and you totally ignore them! How
about the people offering gates for donations? Did you forget about
them? Are THEY exhibiting a "sense of community"?

Name the spots where I can get "Plenty" of loot? Name the spots where
I won't get pushed aside by camp stealers when they want the spot?
Think I can solo in PC??  How about Highpass Keep??
