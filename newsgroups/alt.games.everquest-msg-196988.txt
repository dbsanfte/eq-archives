	You were already rewarded for that, by having access to higher-teir zones
for all this time.

	This is a game.  It is not work.  It is never work.  If you did anything
in EverQuest for any reason other than "it was fun", you have deluded
yourself.

	They'll be exactly what they are like now: full of incompetent boobs who
think they're the shit because someone dragged them through a trials group.

	For that matter, the discussions I see on public channels coming out of
Tactics and Thunder are the exact same ones I used to see coming out of
Karnor's and Sebilis.  And how could they not be?  It's all the same people.

	Flags were an unbelievably stupid idea that probably looked pretty good on
paper.  The implementation destroyed guilds and RL friendships.  The faster
they're done away with, the better.
