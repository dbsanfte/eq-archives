    Group heals are crap in AoE groups, I find. Grossly inefficient (our
group heals are mostly poo to begin with). Using CE/Remedy/DL is the way to
go, unless you have a warrior pulling.

    We have a warrior with Earthshaker and I think the rampage AA ability
(or is it flurry? can never recall which warriors get). Last time we were in
Acrylia, pre-nerf, he did 100 DPS to every one of the 60-odd Grimlings in
the pull for the entirety of the fight if averaged out over all of them. And
it takes a horde of grimlings a long time to burrow through a 7500 HP
warrior when he pulls.

    Depends on environment. I like how quickly a good wizard can tag a bunch
of mobs on the run with the Flux staff, but for close-quarters pulling or in
places where there's harm touches that warrior with a million AA points and
the right gear is king.
