Hi all.
Having recently gotten Levitate at 39 (My main is L40 Ranger) I have
been introduced to the delights of not half-killing myself on a
SOW-propelled run through a mountain range.  However, my
rapidly-dwindling supply of bat wings leads me to make this post:

Does anyone have a list of vendors that sell them? 

Thanks
