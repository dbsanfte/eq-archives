As a healer I tended to shiver when a ranger joined group, expeccially
in the late 30's and 40's.  They would take a lot of mojo to keep
alive, even tho they don't want to tank, they always end up getting
aggro.  Once got celestial heal with velious, things got a lot easier.
Now in the 50's its not much of a problem at all.  

Personally I'd much rather have a ranger than druid. Get them to pull,
they snare, can sow and do a lot of melee dmg. Tho hardly ever turn
anyone down. Was in akeva ruins with a 56ish ranger and he was tanking
like a madman.

Don't do a lot of kiting anymore, but think a druid partner is better
for that. Tho had great time playing my mage fear kiting animals with
a ranger.

Bottom line is, every class is good in a group. Even the most ragtag
combo of classes can be highly effective. 3 chanters, monk and bard;
two clerics and a rouge; four mages (devastating); one warrior, a
ranger, a rouge, chanter, cleric, and anything (perfect group); etc 

But as long as have fun and get some loot whats the difference
