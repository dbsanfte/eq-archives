Why are you oom as the only healer fighting mobs that proc DoTs that
you can cure with a spell?  If you cast Yaulp (or even considered it)
you should be taken out and beaten severely.  If you're going to be
group healer as a Paladin you absolutely must manage your mana very
effectively.

If you are going to presume that the Paladin is incompetent, sure, by
all means have him trained in bind wounds.
