Only if you play in the full screen mode.  The windowed mode is always
640x480 pixels regardless of screen resolution, so if you resolution is
higher, it just centers it using 640x480 pixels.  Hit F10 to change screen
modes.  The default is the windowed mode, the first time you hit F10, you
will go to full screen with windows for various information, the second time
you hit F10 you will go to full screen with no windows.  The third time you
will switch back to the windowed mode.  If you are one of those people that
cannot play in the full screen mode, or does not want to, then the answer is
No, you cannot display the windowed mode in a higher resolution using more
of or all of the screen.  I don't know if Luclin will change that, and
frankly, it doesn't matter to me, I would never switch back to the windowed
display.
