Cross between dumbass and jackass seems closer still.

Saved, I guess. Instead, I was raised on original (ie. much less
corny) Sesame Street until I was 5 years old and we moved here.
So I got to see Skomakergata the second or third time it aired - even
understood Norwegian by then :)

Heh. I'm kinda scary about leveling when I put my mind to it... I have
less than 33 days played, and now 18 and 1/3 blues to go :)

I'll be making in-game eggnog for Christmas, and maybe pound cake
(pretend it's Christmas fruitcake). I'm also going to try to set up a
couple small newbie events in Faydwer, and I have guildies who want to
run some in the Qeynos area.
