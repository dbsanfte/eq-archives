As a Wizard you have to be willing to be mutli-dimentional (at least fake
it).  I had difficulty finding groups until I changed my phiosophy on this.

If I get in a group without a druid, ranger, etc...  I am in charge of
Snaring and if there is not a chanter I also take on the CC role.  Root and
park adds (kite if necessary somethimes).  The fact of the matter is, it
will go faster with you in the group (somebody mentioned this).

I somethimes take the role as the puller. I drop Elnerick's Entombment of
Ice and follow it up with snare.  When the MA gets agro I run off and grab
another, when I get back I finish off the first and they are ready for the
next one.  The only real problem here is there is some down time for me to
get mana back, but it is a lot of fun.

It can also depend on how you play with the group.  My frame of mind is, I
can cave nearly anyone in the group by stealing agro.  If the cleric is OOM
or getting beat on and they can't get agro off em, I drop a big nuke and
this gets the mob on me.  Yea, you are soft a squishy so you fall fast, but
if you save the cleric or a tank that is gonna die cuz the cleric is OOM,
you gain respect.  I find I am a rare wizard in that I don't mind dieing for
the cause.  I NEVER run when in a group.

Also don't forget the easiest way to get exp, AE groups.  Two chanters, two
wizards, and a bard.  We have the bard pull, enchanters chain stun, bard
weaves a dot and AE mez, wizards nuke away.  Make sure the chanters stand
side by side and face a wall (best way to get the mobs really packed in).
