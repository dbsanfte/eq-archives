There's a couple of ways to go through Nadox so best bet is to check
your map when you get there. Explore a bit, one way has some mobs in
the way that see invis (need IVU), the other doesn't. ... at least
till you get to the docks close to HF, at that point you're best off
just training to the zone line.

If you take your time and make sure to clear the side rooms before
moving down the ship, you can keep all the pulls to 2 or less at 65,
might be doable solo at that level if you can kill fast enough to
avoid the repops.
