Not a split server or specialty server, a nice new server. Haven't had

Luclin should have come out with a new server.

Hudson Hawk: "Gates tries to blackmail me, you ask me 'Did I miss
anything.' Gates gets killed, you say 'Did I miss anything.' I bet
you went up to Mrs. Lincoln at the Ford Theatre and said 'How was
the show? Did I miss anything?'"
