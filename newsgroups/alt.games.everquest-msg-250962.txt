That's nice. It's always good to hear that there are far weaker people
out there to make myself feel better. Your experiences, instanced
against those of hundreds of thousands of others would show that such
cases are freak occurances, involving, well, freaks.

If this game were such a danger, as you say, then those hundreds of
thousands would also be so affected, and at that number, government
agencies would most definately step in. 

Quiet, you.
