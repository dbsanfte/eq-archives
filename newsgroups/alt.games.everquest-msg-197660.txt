This reminds me of an event that was run by a friend's guild once: Halflings from
Hell (or was it "in Hell"...). Everyone in the guild created a level one halfling,
with a name based on the name of their main character in the guild, then tried to
run (on the paths) to the Commons side of Kith in the middle of the night. It was
quite a lot of fun to watch.
