I had really planned on jumping in when the Combine server opened up. I 
was in on the beta, but I really didn't care much for the idea of putting 
any sort of (untwinked) time into a character I knew would be wiped soon. 
Therefore, that officially removed me from the sort of player demographic 
they really needed to help them test. I figured I'd just wait for it to 
go live. 

Then, as that day approached, I began to consider just what the world of 
Norrath would be like during the first days on the progression servers 
and decided to wait a bit.

Here it is, a month later, and I'm ready to give it a go. I figure the 
newbie areas have calmed down significantly by now. Trouble is, I seem to 
be suffering from Lance Berg's disease ("I...I..i...AM THE LUCKIEST 
GNOME...OMe...ome...ON THE FACE OF NORRATH...RAth...rath..."). I can't 
freaking decide what class to play! I've really played them all to some 
extent - enough to have a pretty good notion of what they're all about, 
but only a couple to any significant level. My problem isn't that I can't 
find one to suit me, it's that I can't decide which one's *not* to play, 
really.

I'm seriously considering the following:

Ranger - A nice offensive class with many perks, not the least of which 
being tracking, which is insanely useful. I like melee'ing being an 
option for getting out of a scrape.

Mage - This was one of the classes I've enjoyed the most in the past, and 
their summoned items would really be of great benefit on the progression 
server. Trouble is, it seems everyone else thinks so as well. Plus, the 
one major flaw I've seen in this class is spell research. Talk about a 
chore!

Beastlord - Of all the classes, this is the one I've played the least, 
though I did enjoy it. Again, however, pet class = more popular on a 
progression server.

Shaman - One of my most-played classes. I really liked it, though canni-
dancing gets old. Trouble is, I don't care for the evil shaman options, 
and don't want to replay a Barbarian shaman all over again.

Enchanter - Another one of my most-played classes, though I still never 
broke 40 (heh, that sounds odd when I actually say it, as I spent a lot 
of time only to have gotted to the high 30's on that one). I always found 
crowd control to be very fun and it will be even more important on a 
progression server. Stacking issues, though?...

Druid - Would be great fun, but it's probably the most active class on 
the server.

Necro - Possibly second only to the druid as the most active class on the 
server. Never played one past the mid-teens, but enjoyed it.

Ahh, well. Any comments are welcome.
