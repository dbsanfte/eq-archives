I believe the bard you're looking for is one "Cordelia Minister". She is
normally standing at the wizard spires in North Karana, but every so often
walks up the path past the guard tower and gypsy camp to the Inn in the
northwest corner of the zone. She'll stand there for around 15 minutes and
then retrace her path back to the spires (provided she's not killed by a
griffon, hill giant or evil PC)
