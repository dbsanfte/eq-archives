Did you use the "/yell" command (which can be abbreviated to "/y")?  The /y
command sends a message to all nearby people, saying something like "Soandso
yells for help from your left".

What you are missing is that for everyone like you, that is getting his ass
kicked by a couple mobs he can't handle, and knows it, there are people out
there who think they can win in your situation (sometimes even justifiably,
because they have a ton of HP from twinking and buffing, and even though
they are at a sliver of life, that sliver is big), and when someone jumps in
and helps without being *sure*, that person ends up getting called a kill
stealer in /shout and /ooc, and even petitioned.

Also, you can't assume the mage saw any communication from you.  Outside of
raids, I only have one chat window, with everything going to it.  Any
message from you might scroll off pretty fast if he had battle spam enabled
and was close to the fight.

The problem with pets is that they help by fighting the mob.  Note that
unless they do so much damage to get to the top of the hate list, the mobs
are going to stay on you.  This means that all the Mage's helping would do
is make the mobs die faster.  In a fight where you are going to lose, but
not by a lot, that would change it to a win.  However, in a fight where you
are getting creamed, which this one sounds like, that probably would NOT
save you, just leaving the Mage to perhaps get creamed afterwards.

This is the same for all classes that help by inflicting damage (although
classes with "taunt" could taunt the mobs off you.  That works, *if* they
are pretty sure they can take them both alone, becuase they have no idea if
you will stay around to help, or if you just want to get a gate off and get
out of there).

It's less of a problem for healing classes, because they can heal you to let
you keep going so you can win the fight...but there is still a risk.  First,
if you don't win, they will have aggro.  Second, even before that, if you
need a lot of healing, they might get aggro during the fight.  Of course,
Mages can't heal you, so this is just for future reference.

Another option to help you is to root the mobs.  That lets you step back and
gate if that's what you want, and if it turns out you are one of those who
sees "helping" as "attempted KSing", all you have to do is not step back,
and no harm done.  This does mean that the rooter gets aggro if you gate or
die, but the rooter can gate too.  This is what I'd probably do as a
Wizard--root your mobs, say "rooted!", and back up quite a ways to see what
you do.  If you run away and gate, I'd gate too.  If you don't run away, I'd
watch to see what happens, and if you lose, I'd root and gate.  Mages don't
get root, I believe, so this is not an option for them.  Also, it would
depend on where the rooter is bound--his travel time back might be
significantly more than the time it would take you to make up a death.

It would certainly be nice, both from a "let's be nice people" point of
view, and from a role playing point of view, if it was always OK to help
people, without risking stealing their kill.  (Of course, care would still
be required, because people would tend to jump in on people who aren't
really in trouble, and some of those might be enjoying the challenge of the
fight, and so the help would be unwelcome).

It's interesting to compare to other games.  In DAoC, they award XP
differently, making it less likely for someone to try to KS, but also making
it less likely for healers to jump in and help.  That's because there when a
mob is attacked by more than one group (let's count a solo player as a group
of one), the XP is split among the groups according to damage done.  So, if
you try to KS someone, and do 60% of the damage, you get 60% of the XP, and
they get 40%.  You are better off finding someplace else, where you can get
100%, than trying to KS from people.  However, casting benficial spells on
someone in combat counts as damage when figuring the XP split, so if a
healer comes along and heals you when you are fighting, that healer will get
some of the XP from the kill.  So, some people get pissed off at helping
heals if they aren't explicitly asked for.  I'm not sure which system I like
better.
