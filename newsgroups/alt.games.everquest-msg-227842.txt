I'm sure it will play EQ with nearly max effects and models.

However, (someone else already pointed this out) Compaq is the crap of
the crap when it comes to hardware.

I've build, upgraded, repaired etc many computers, many among them
compaqs. The things they do to cut costs are generally really bad,
such as:

- If seen compaqs, that instead of having a fan on the processor, they
had a somewhat unwieldly plastic duct hooked to the powersupply to
utilize that fan. For one, that draws almost no air, additionally,
that left no room in the box to upgrade, or change anything.
- They are famous for using proprietary crap hardware. Drivers suck,
Bios has weird limitations and a general lack of functionality. They
squeeze everything they can on the motherboard (sound, network,
controllers, videocard) and sometimnes forget to give the bios the
option to disable this crap. The hardware they use was the cheapest
they could get. The ram and the harddrive are most likely the bottom
of reliability.
- If you make any modifications to your computer, they will not give
you tech support.

I know this is probably not an option, but bringing that computer
back, going to the local geek store and getting an AMD system
(processor is 1/3 the cost) put together for you, you could probably
get a few nice additions for the same total cost.

option 1: Even though you have a lot of ram now, adding another 512MB
will still noticeably speed things up at times, especially if you're
like me and work while medding/soloing and multitask while playing.
option 2: Upgrade the video card. Not sure what kind of budget you're
on, but if you can afford the new ATI.. they are nice!
option 3:Another Hard drive can also be nice. Especially if you set
things up so your system is on one drive, and your programs and
everything else is on another, you can squeeze some more performance
out of your box.
option 4: Windows XP professional is A LOT nicer, especially if you're
going to be using this thing for work.

Not sure where you live, but the local phone company now ships weird
DSL modems that already are basically a NAT device. cheap NAT devices
are oftentimes not very compatible with other ones, meaning you might
be better of getting a hub if you get one of those. But it sounds like
you already bought one...

One general rule people overlook when installing ethernet: avoid
running the cable in parallel to any power cable, or across any spool
of extension cable. That will seriously decrease the data you can push
through them, and increase the error rate.

I'm not sure from your description if you have a hub, switch, or
router type device (they are fundamentally different). But if it's
going to be a hub or any setup that doesn't involve a firewall/router
between every computer on your network and the outside, then make sure
you disassociate file sharing from tcp/ip in the bindings in the
network properties. You can still share files over other protocols,
but those are generally not routable, i.e. won't leave your home
network.

Also, whenever you get on any always-on type connection, make sure you
do a windows update on all machines once a week.
