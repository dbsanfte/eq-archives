The thing about it is, no matter how much my 54 shaman buffs up a level 6
puma, it's still just a level 6 puma, with lots of hitpoints.  It still
cannot hit a level 50 player for any significant damage, and a level 50
player will make very quick work of it.  Sure, it will be tough for a level
6 player to take on, but it's just a free port to them anyway.  After a BL
buffs the Puma, if the BL is level 60, the puma should be somewhere in the
50s, quite a challenge all of a sudden for a level 50 player.
