While it's been a LONG time since I did the Paw quest, I don't recall
the faction hit being all that big.  At least, it didn't seem change
any of my con's to the guards anyway.  Granted, I did spend a LOT of
time in Blackburrow.

FWIW, if you have ok faction with Qeynos guards, it's just easier to
kill him.
