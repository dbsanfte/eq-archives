Yep, my typing is sloppy.  You'll find I rarely bug anyone about their
syntax and grammar as long as they can get their point across, which
obviously I accomplished.

Why would I want a killfile?  Automated censorship is the worst kind.
Plus eschewing them has the added advantage of making those I ignore
all the more tormented because I have consciously chosen to ignore
them.   If your posts are devoid of point they have as much meaning to
me as 'We make holes in teeth'.  I dont reply to pointless posts, so
as I suggested, you can save yourself the time of posting them, which
will in turn save us the time from skipping right over them.  This
goes for the rest of the folks on the FA class trip, if you really are
more than one person...
