How do spells work in eq2?  I've got a mage and the apprentice I and II are
confusing me.  Also, it said I learned a new spell when I hit lvl 8, but all
the buttons at the bottom were filled up, so where did the spell go?  Do I
have to buy any spells or do they all just get given to me when I hit
certain levels?
