Ragebringer IS easy if you have a giant guild with lots of
level 60's.

Ragebringer is also a chance at a TGW (Total Guild Wipeout)
if you are in a small non-uber guild counting on a level 56
friend of the guild to tank and playing early morning when it's
hard to pick up extras for a General run.   Hell, the Cleric
epic is exceedingly easy...only difference is that most of
the rogue epic is spawnable-mobs, and the Cleric has that
annoying Ragefire camp.  "Easy" to me means not that
hard-of-mobs to kill (heck, we did our last Plasmatic priest
bash with 2 clerics 5 melee, and the MT was a 52 SK, not
"boring sit on your ass for a long while and wait." That's
just "tedious," not "difficult."


"Difficult" is getting dragon scales and Trak's guts.  "Difficult"
is not "stand for 2 hours foraging at the zone in."  Again, that's
just "tedious," not "difficult."  Ragebringer is not an "easy"
quest, although like I said, it does have a singular advantage
that  all the "fighting" mobs in the quest are triggered.
