Sorry for the double reply...

But, yeah, login queues are gone on all but a handful of servers. Full
minute loot lag is gone, though there is still some loot lag on rare
occasions. Nightly crashes of ALL the servers are gone. It's the
whiner revisionist history that spawns these claims of "no
improvement". If anyone believes that who played at launch, they're
smoking something that's fucking with their brains.
