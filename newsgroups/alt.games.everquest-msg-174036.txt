Dan? Mr Oil Man?

You're not qualified to even comment anymore until you inform
yourself.



" The US CIA Director (DCI) Dr. Deutch promised to topple Hussein
before Saddam's attack on Kurds in northern Iraq. Deutch had promised
that the Iraqi dictator would be toppled within a year, but Hussein
discovered and foiled a $20-million covert op to un seat him. This is
one of the greatest setbacks U.S. intel has ever suffered, an
anonymous senior U.S. official told the Los Angeles times. Paper said
the six-year op was one of the largest authorized by Clinton. [Reuters
9/8/96]"



" A bloody CIA covert op with its cover blown sky high. Iraqi
democrats promised significant help in toppling Saddam five years ago
are now in despair. Kurdistan is facing a general collapse. The
Kurdish regional govt. that was supposed to have displaced Baghdad's
rule over an area of 3.5 million people has disintegrated. Kurdish
leaders Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani have been fighting each
other rather than cooperating to topple Saddam.

Most embarrassing U.S. failure in Kurdistan is that of CIA, which
backed the wrong horse. The CIA centered its covert program styled as
the Iraqi National Accord, or WAFAQ in Arabic. Accords leaders were
once Saddam's cronies. The leaders promised they c ould mount a quick
coup. They failed. One of the key bomb-makers disclosed publicly that
bombs financed by CIA have killed scores of Iraqi civilians in Baghdad
and destroyed HQs of rival National Congress in Salahedin.

This represents an all too familiar failure by CIA. CIA defends its
covert programs by saying it has to deal with people who are not
angels. What it does not explain is why it consistently deals with
corrupt incompetents."


 " 'Desperate Kurds consider turning once more to Saddam.' Bankrupted
by Saddam and shortchanged by West, Kurds so financially strapped,
their leaders talking of renewing negotiations with Saddam...."


" "Kurds contend U.S. encouraged rebellion via `Voice of Free Iraq.'"
Kurds contend voice of free Iraq sponsored by CIA and owes moral
obligation to rebels who rose up. U.S. officials decline to confirm or
deny U.S. involvement. [Washington Post 4/9/91 a 17]"


" All too often the CIA has recruited `freedom fighters' around the
world and then let them fend for themselves when things got tough:
Hungarians in 56, Sumatran's in 58, Cuban exiles in 61, Kurdish rebels
in 72, Meo tribesmen and Montagnards; most recently the Nicaraguan
contras. [WP 7/20/89 outlook 15]"


" United States had organized a Kurdish insurrection against Saddam
Hussein as a favor by President Nixon to the Shah of Iran, only to
abandon the Kurds to destruction when the Iranian and Iraqi leaders
settled their border dispute. Account appears in th e leaked version
of the House of Representatives Pike Committee report of 1976.
[Washington Post 4/7/91 d3]"


" "Our movement and people are being destroyed in an unbelievable way,
with silence from everyone. We feel, your Excellency, that the United
States has a moral and political responsibility towards our people,
who have committed themselves to your country' s policy." written by
Mustafa Barazini, to Secretary of State Kissinger on 3/10/75. Letter
could have been written to Bush by Massoud Barazani, leader of the
devastated Kurds in 91"



Yeah. I'm sure they're REAL happy for that no fly zone. Bestest
friends with the US, mm hmm.


Dan? Mr. Oil Man?

You know nothing about what's going on. Zilch.
