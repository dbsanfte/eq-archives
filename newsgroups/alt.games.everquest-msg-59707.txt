I've been soloing and duoing my Cleric ( currently 12th level ) so far, and 
I'm am about to start joining groups when my partner isn't available.  At 
this point, with the incredibly large percentage of the population 
not understanding grouping, I prefer duoing with someone intelligent over 
joining a group of unknowns, but I can't always eat my cake, too.

But, before I start joining pick-up groups, I would like to understand more 
about timing on healing ( in groups ).

How much health should I let my pet, uh, tank pull with?  When ( bubs of 
health ) should I be applying heals to keep aggro off of my ass?  Should I 
use more lower heals to reduce aggro or will that produce the opposite 
effect?

I already have my "get this fucker off the cleric"-type hotkey set up, and 
I'm trying to get my AC as high as possible to take the pummeling when I -
do- get aggro.  I'm also trying to get more mana items instead of the Wis I 
tems I already have.

Any other tips?
