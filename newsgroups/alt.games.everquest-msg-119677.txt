I'm referring to there being an assload of trees, a lot of hills, and a
propensity for the graphic lag to happen right as you approach a cliff, but
fortunately going away when you hit the bottom of the cliff.

My old computer had no issues there, but that was pre-luclin, and I kept
hearing of people with better computers than mine having a hell of a time in
that zone.  Basically, if you're used to playing with a  max clip plane, get
un-used to it.

Use shift and the +/- keys at the end of the number row to increase/decrease
clip plane, decrease it til you don't have lag, but always keep it at least
2 or 3 clicks out from minimum, because with minimum, you have no lag, but
you also have no visibility, and will still run off a cliff.

Also, levitate is useful for learning your way around, and nothing in zone
other than some newbie skeletons see invis/camo.  There's the giant fort,
which is a tad difficult unless you're grouped or just pulling the entry
guards, and there's a 3 spawn hut a ways north from the fort that has a big
clearing near it, that 3 spawn hut is where I always hunted.  You didn't say
what race you were, but if you're halfling or wood elf, use racial hide when
you meditate, there are wanderers in that area, but fairly easy to avoid
while kiting, not so easy when you're sitting there meditating.

If you're unclear on how to use racial hide, make the hot button, target
something that isn't indifferent and doesn't see invis, hit hide, con it, if
it's not indifferent, take hide off and try again.
