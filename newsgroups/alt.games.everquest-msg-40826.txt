No, I did. They were up. But with Verant no longer posting the number of people
on the servers, I could not tell if it was the usuall 500 people that are
normally on at that time, or if there was only 3 people testing the system.

I never resorted to insults. I'm sorry that you felt such a need.

And in every past patch, the servers themselves don't go down except when
actually adding content. Other times, they are either locked or have several
people on them testing the changes. That does not mean that the servers are open
to the public, or that they have finished the patching process.

Again with the insults. Mr. Monk's post was not on my server when I made my
post. But if you knew anything about the Usenet, you would have considered that
possibility.

Wow, I must have really hurt you by implying that the patch wasn't done yet. Are
you seeing spiders and suffering delerium tremens from EQ withdrawal yet?

I did take a short bus to school, actually. It took me from my high school to
the local community college, where I was taking advanced calculus and literature
classes not otherwise available. But then, I had effectively graduated from high
school before I was old enough to stop going to school.
