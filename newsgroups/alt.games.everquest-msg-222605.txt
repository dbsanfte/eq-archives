The first problem is your massive level of exaggeration.  Due to the way
damage bonus works, *I* didn't start regularly doing 80 damage with 1h
weapons as a monk until well into my 50s.  I'd go so far as to say that it
would be impossible for a level 21 beastlord to hit for 80 with a 1h weapon.

Twinking has enough of an impact that there is no need to inflate the
figures.  Your point will still get shot down regardless, because twinking
is an inherent part of the game, but it will get shot down faster when
you're just making shit up.

Actually, paladins are pretty much known for having the best imagineable
ability to keep aggro...  that's true at level 30, 50, and 65, and
everywhere in between.
