Ahh there's the difference, I am turning in a stack usually when i head to
Akanon for regurgitonic, so inbetween each stein run, i turn in a stack, it
probably helps I was already at amiable when I started however.  I did the bone
chip quest quite a bit as a young druid to help finance my spells I never had to
buy armor until I started looking for upgrades to patch work.  I was able to
totaly equip myself with the quest, and selling what i didn't need even to
merchants i usually netted a profit when buying bone chips.  I never understood
why more people didn't seem to use this quest.  If your character is "born" on
Faydewar, this quest is great for newbies.
