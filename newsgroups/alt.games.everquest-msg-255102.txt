Why do you think there will be no benefit? A chest is just another 
mob... a mob with xp (iirc) and drops.

I had a friend group with a tank once in BoT (i think it was), and when 
the monk pulled a named (blue con named, when the group was dealing with 
red cons normally), the tank did not engage, sat down, and camped out. 
10 minutes the tank returned, when questioned about the incident he said 
the puller had no business 'risking his xp' by bringing a named to camp. 
He made my friends permanent ignore list.

I guess he thought someone else decided to risk the party safety and xp 
in what he felt was an unneccesary risk, which he will have no benefit 
from.

Sound familiar? It should. He just drew his line in the sand somewhere 
else.

I'll grant that opening a chest in ldon is a unique challenge, but no 
more so than engaging a chealer, gater, fearer, or charmer. Provided the 
group is properly prepared and equipped for the engagement they will do 
just fine.
