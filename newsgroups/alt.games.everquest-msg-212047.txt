Haven't honestly taken note I tend to use Cinder out of habit as much as
anything. As an archery ranger aggro isn't really a problem unless I get too
nuke happy. I can say that the lightning giants tend to be more fire
resistant than the others (especially irritating since I use a fire bow).
Causing me to typically switch out arrows to magic based Shadow acrylia from
Champs. Suppose I should be switching to jolt at the same time but since I
use it really only for pulling and even a resisted jolt tends to cut into
ones DPS enough to reduce your hate its never been an issue.

I've worked with some really good tanks myself but the only way they can
have agro with out me having to do the old stand by them and take a hit or
two method is if they pull.
Not that this is exactly group killing since it only reduces my over all dps
by a fraction and I've never been in a group that would break up because
only a Warlord was available to tank ;-) still all and all most people I've
known really would prefer a Knight.

Well after the big monk nerf they aren't exactly mitigating that well
anymore. Personally I'd far rather get the Melee hit point bonus they
screwed us out of with Kurnak ;) It gets really depressing when as a bad ass
kicking ranger who lives on health food and runs everywhere is only slightly
more physically resilient than a damn Necromancer. But hey wouldn't wanna
get too greedy I'll take my AM3 EQ and not rock the boat.

Hard for me to judge 50-55 was mostly done prior to pop. In fact I was 56th
before I ever stepped into PoTranq, Course back then one could get a group
pretty consistently in UP and the xp was amazing. 60-65 was different
because I blasted to 62nd then stoped to get Hunter which seemed to take
forever but I honestly did it in about a week or so. 62nd-65 was insanely
easy however. After AM3 it was just Ding ding ding. Then plink plink plink
ect ; ) It is pretty amazing how much easier the next 50 AA were to get than
the first 45
