Seeing as how I (like an idiot) chased a fleeing Howler into a group
of Pack Elders. Shaman, and Larges, I'd have to say "No".  I didn't
notice a difference.  Of course, Mend would choose this as a time
to fail.  I had managed to pickup a Pit Fighter or two on my run (crawl)
to the zone.  Didn't make it. Had one large circle of Kobolds standing
around spitting on my corpse. *sigh*
