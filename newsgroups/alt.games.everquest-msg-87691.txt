Actually, the necro get's quite the variety of fun spells. And a variety
of dots as well, so once you've made about level 12 everyone can have
their own dot for each mob. And of course, once they make it to 24, they
start getting nukes, so stacking isn't a problem. But I was thinking
more in terms of:

Four pets gang banging the mobs. (And no ONE pet *ever* doing 50%
damage.)
Crowd control (once they get ST) That's a group that could just wade
into mob camps. Or, for tougher mob groups, ST is a wonderful tool to
split camps for pulling.
Healing, both for pets and each other. (Level limited, yes, but nice.)
Mana control. This group would *NEVER* have to stop pulling once they
learned to cycle in and out who was going to burn mana.
Fear stability. I solo a necro. Fear being resisted or lasting one
second is a HUGE pain in the arse. But the group would have four chances
at it quickly if required. Same for snares that wear off.
Travel anywhere: Necros probably solo better in dungeons than many other
solo classes (like druids) but it's still rough. But the versatility of
four necros could make them a viable dungeon group, I'm betting. (Never
tried it obviously, but imagining the possibilities is enticing.)

Plus, there's just something cool about the mental image of four masters
of the dead strolling into an area with their skeletal pets and just
burning the place down. :-)
