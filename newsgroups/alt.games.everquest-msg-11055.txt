This method does indeed work, but proceed with caution:  if you map a
user-defined key onto your forward button, it will trigger whichever ability
is in that slot at the time.  For example, if 'sense heading' is in slot #2
in your travelling hotkey bank, and 'autoattack' is in the #2 slot in your
combat bank, you'd better be damned sure that your travelling bank is up
whenever you want to move forward... or it's gonna be ugly.

Let me know if you need an even more confusing explanation.
