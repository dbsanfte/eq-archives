Don't they have the best DS in the game, though?  If his pet was to be 
MA while the rest of the group used more damage oriented pets, this 
might have been a good plan... and you'd -want- the pet to go OOM so 
he'd stop screwing up mob positioning and the like.   If there was ever 
a spell I plan to avoid ever casting, its Kindle.  Now if there was a 
Dampen, that sucked pet mana away so he'd shut up and melee like a good 
little decoy, that I'd be happy to cast!

I have noticed that the recast time of malaise is a bit annoying on a 
fail, and seeing a resist message followed by shaman spamming a "slow 
resisted" message is annoying, while I watch the greyed out malaise and 
consider memming a second in the line for such occaisions.  Faster 
recast time might make me bump Malaise out at last, which after 49 
levels of nearly always sitting in slot one is going to be a pretty 
weird thing.

Aye, if it had a 10 minute duration or something it would be a lot more 
tempting.  But considering that it costs more points than I currently 
have available, and a higher point limit than I have in Any dungeon 
theme, I imagine it will be quite a while before I bother with it.

Well, I can say for certain that the Phantasmal Armor and previous 
spells do NOT cast with Virtue, Temp, or Aego.  And I can say for 
certain that Shield of Words (49 cleric AC buff) overwrites TPP.  I can 
only surmise that TPP is also overwritten by Virtue, Temp, and Aego, 
because thus far I've successfully avoided having anyone cast one of the 
big three on me since getting TPP.

I can't think of many circumstances in which I'll want Virtue et al; if 
I'm giving up TPP its because POTC, POTG, POT9 or BOT9 are available, 
and those too don't stack with the Virtue line.  So I'd only want Virtue 
in situations where my max HP is more important than my hp and mana 
regen.  And in those circumstances, I'd hope that there would be a druid 
available, in which case I still wouldn't want Virtue, as POT9 plus 
symbol of Khazad is actually More hp than virtue, and wouldn't deny me 
mana regen.

The shielding line is far from inconsequential, my current one is good 
for 244 hp and 23 MR, both substantial boosts given the abyssimal state 
of mage HP bars.  It does not stack with the Focus line, though, and 
depending on how important MR is in a given encounter, Focus line may 
well yeild even more HP.  Interesting, though, is that the spell 
Infusion of Spirit (IOS) -does- stack with the Shielding line; this is a 
61 beastlord buff thats available to shaman at 49 (though few have it), 
and the HP you get from IOS plus shielding is superior to what you gain 
from HOS.  This probably stops being true with level 60+ shaman buffs, 
since there seems to be no upgrade to IOS; I haven't done the math.

For even more HP, get the Stamina line from shaman (stacks with IOS, not 
sure if it does with HOS since I normally don't get HOS)  Oh, and 
there's the Brell's line from paladins, that seems to stack with all of 
the above too.
