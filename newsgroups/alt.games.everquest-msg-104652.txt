Aye, Mage 25 point DS plus my 15 point MoR is 40 points worth of "don't
touch me there" which certainly isn't Feta.

Aha, as I mentioned in some other thread, I've been playing in Ench-less
groups a good deal lately due to that being the "needed" class currently
in short supply on MT at high levels.  Didn't occur to me but with a
chanter and mage doing Tash/Malosi I was suddenly having no trouble at
all sticking to mobs five levels over my head... of course!

Hmm, does it break Mez?  I have to agree, not once did I get aggro
strictly from casting MoR.  Of course I exercise a degree of caution
in terms of aggro discipline, but emboldened by this discussion I tried
MoR earlier and earlier with no problems.  Earlier I can land this the
better, cause its damage from every hit, like a group DS, particularly
helpful while establishing control where the mob isn't yet cooperating
with the MA approach.

Against some of the level 60 ME mobs, I was noticing that its duration
is actually not long enough to last a whole fight.
