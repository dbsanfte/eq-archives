Hello, I'm trying to find ANY quests I can do for fun, and hopefully
exp and loot, between lvls 50 & 55, I'm currently 53, and I'm a little
tired of the, kill everything blue to you, exp grind.  I wanna take a
break and maybe do some quests, but allakhzhams has fixed it so you
cannot find quests by lvl and class w/o knowing which zone, which
quest, which item or what not unless you are a paying member and to be
honest, I just don't have anymore cash lying around.

Ok here are the details...

I am a lvl 53 gnome magician, running around in gear comprised mostly
of fabled with whatever augments I can get, and the stuff that drops
off the big skellies in the newbie zones (aka Dark Hoop of the
Necromancer), then I also have all my summoned crap.  I have already
done earring of the solstice and really enjoyed it.  I also have the
beginners magic manual.

I have an augmenting my planar charm (wooden idol or something like
that), I have my adventurers stone.  After over 100 adventures and
talking to all relevant NPCs, I still don't have any stats from the
thing, but thats a different gripe all together.

I have been working on my epic, and am now to the point where the
stuff I needs requires a guild raid, of which my guild is basically to
busy to help with.. (Time for new guild possibly)

So any suggestions on good fun, soloable quests for my lvl?
p.s. I can two box and duo with my wifes cleric, but that gets to be a
pain in the ass.
