Blue is a givaway, that shade is known as Lambent, and is the classic bard twink
armor (although I think there may be one or two that came by it honestly).
There's also a pale green thats Singing Steel that you may see move by you in a
blur.

This is theft, lad, a bard is perfectly happy with multiple mobs on his butt...
if he's not he's more than capable of losing one or more at will.

Personally, I always say I'm not only happy with at least two mobs... there are
mobs I can't kill one of but can easily kill two, three, four at a time.  This
is because they cooperate in beating the living daylights out of each other
while I stand around and play a little ditty on the pipes.

In fact for any class, unless they yell for help, assume they mean to have all
the mobs on them that you see.

The Selos' line of spells makes a bard and anyone near him in his group run at a
speed of a character SOW'd by a level 9 shaman, when sung.  However, when played
on a set of drums, this speed goes up based on the bard's percussion skill and
the quality of his drum.  A decent bard with a good drum is faster than a level
65 druid casting spirit of cheetah... by about level 45.    Only trouble with
this stuff is its so fast that a bard may end up spending a lot of his time
standing around on street corners waiting for the mobs to catch up... or running
back after them because they lost interest, he got so far ahead.

ps I recall back at level 15 having a foot race with a 54 druid friend across
the karanas.  We started out neck and neck, and I pulled ahead very slowly as we
ran along.  She called out to me as we passed the gypsy camp "Well I surrender,
you are faster, but not by much".  Thats when I took off the Walk mode and shot
off like a bat out of hell.  Of course Walrus Skins are more than a good drum,
Selos drums of the March are better but thats about it.
