How I get money. I do LDoN win items and sell them. I troll bazaar and often
someone sells something really cheap which I buy to sell at double the
price. Since bazaar prices have gone up 100% I dont give a crap anymore
because now I will never be able to afford what I want. Bazaar is full of
scammers too so you have to be carefull.
