Ow.  I just spent several levels there and can't fathom it, unless someone 
wandered off.

Sometimes there is a a Mob there at the zone-in room, and he floats around.  
If he floated to the right, and someone aggroed him, he may have socially 
aggroed a spider above him ( on the ledge that you jump down from when you 
are heading out of Kaesora ) which could pull a -serious- train of spiders, 
if the one it aggroed were to try to get to you by running the long way.  
It's not possiblt for it to reach you that way, but maybe it would try.

Anyone have the thought of getting a screenshot?  Love to see it.
