If you like the idea of playing a halfling paladin, then it is a good
idea...

*Read the note in your inventory. It will tell you who to hand it to.
That is the person who will train you (Your Class/Guild leader).

*To read notes you must be in "Windowed Mode". That is the mode where
you see the class Icon on the left, and yout view of the world is
"windowed" in the center. Once in Windowed Mode hit "I" to open your
inventory. Then right-click on the note to read it.
