I killed Bandits in the Karanas wuth my Erudin Necro and
then went invis to turn in Sashes to the guy outside Paladin
guild in Qeynos.  This raised faction enough to get me able
to go anywhere in FP and not once have I been attacked.
Qeynos there is some womann that hangs out around the dock
area that hits for several hundred damage per shot.  She
hates me bad (can't wait to kill her at least once).

AS for a Necro weapon.  I never did any mele after level 8
myself, that is the pets job.  If you can find one look for
Rukgus's Sticker to start.  Has 3 str and 2 int.  I can't
remember what I paid for the one I had, but I kept it until
lvl 45.  Stabbed A Hill giant with it once  :-)  only mele I
have done for ages.  FYI the giant was a dead man walkin' or
I would never have gotten close to it.
