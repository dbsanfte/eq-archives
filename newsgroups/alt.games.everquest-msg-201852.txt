The guild I'm in probably doesn't have more than 2 organised raids a month.
However, we play together all the time, and form groups/raids to do stuff on
an adhoc basis. You really need to ask people in the guild what they get
upto to know what the guild is like, as often the web boards are not used
that much.

Guilds also help you build up a network of friends that you can help out /
be helped by. It makes the game a lot richer experience. If you look at one
of the reasons most people give for having stayed so long in the game, it's
because of their friends.
