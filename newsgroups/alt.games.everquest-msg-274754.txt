Hooters repeatedly refers to them as equivalent to cheerleaders; if you 
want to distinguish them from 'mascots' by calling them 'cheerleaders', 
I'm ok with that, but I think cheerleaders serve pretty much the same 
functions as mascots (but/and with sex-appeal).

They would go under if they relied on just the food. :/

Yes, actually it does, that small fraction that primarily serves those 
other purposes are 'just hooters girls' the mascots (cheerleaders), and 
are not primarily waitresses.

From the Hooters Website:

/quote:
... as part of their job, these all-American cheerleaders make 
promotional and charitable appearances in their respective communities. 
Hooters hires women who best fit the image of a Hooters Girl to work in 
this capacity.
/end quote

Given that those elevated from 'waitresses' to real 'Hooters Girls' are 
pretty much at it full time: be it modeling swimsuits for the hooters 
magazine -- which desipite its extensive pictorials features 
surprisingly few nature shots featuring owls, odd given the name...no?? 
:p -- or handing out hooters balloons at the next parade...they are as 
much 'primarily waitresses' as college football stars are 'primarily 
students'

At any rate, the owl theme of Hooters really takes a distant second 
place to the buxom-cheerleader-in-tanktop-&-short-shorts theme of 
Hooters. I don't really think its even really debatable.
