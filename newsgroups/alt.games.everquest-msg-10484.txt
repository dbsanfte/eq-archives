LOL I actually did this down at the dock (I know, WHAT was I thinking?) the
other night.  So I'm sitting there with my incredible tunnel vision, and see
a figure in black robes with a sickle.  I think:  Uh Oh!  Run away!  Run
away!  Some idiot trained a spectre!

I get halfway to the zone line with my drum blazing, when I realize how
unusual it was I didn't see any cries of warning or messages of death.  I
walk back cautiously, and I'm still not seeing anybody panicking... it all
seems to be business as usual.  So I stop a good distance away until my
vision clears.

After it clears I sit down by the dock, and I see this dark elf walk by.
He's got a black robe on, and armed with a scythe.  I just about peed my
pants laughing at my stupidity.

I tried to share the joke with him, but he didn't get it : )  The EQ version
of pink elephants.
