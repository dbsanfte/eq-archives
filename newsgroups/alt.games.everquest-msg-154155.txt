I'm on The Nameless, and notice that there are a few traders who's
names will go unspoken who offer items, fairly ordinary stuff, at
just insanely high prices.

What's the point?  Do they ever actually find buyers at these blantantly
high prices?  Are there enough people who are clueless as to how to use
the /bazaar search that they just search merchant to merchant and buy
stuff without checking for competing prices?

For example, one trader has, say, 40 spider silks to sell, and he is asking
50pp a piece, when there're other traders that have like 200 and are asking
5pp each.

I just don't get this "pricing strategy" if that's what you want to call it.

Another thing ... if they really think they spider silks are worth 50pp, they'd
be nuts to stand there and not buy up the "bargain" 5pp silks.  Think of
the profit!

Anyway, ... very strange mindset, I think.
