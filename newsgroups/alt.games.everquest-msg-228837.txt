They changed the way pets take xp from you.

With normal summoned pets, so long as you do 1 point of damage, you get 
full xp for the kill.  With charmed pets, you get xp based on the 
percentage of damage you do vs what the pet does, not certain what the 
range is on that off the top of my head, but, bard swarm kiting still 
works, so, even with the charmed pet doing most of the damage, you still 
get something on the order of 50% xp.
