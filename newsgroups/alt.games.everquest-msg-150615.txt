I've been playing just over a year now, over 22 characters, and finally
dared to create my
first Bard.  I've grouped with them often but not as much as I would have
liked.

I spent about 3 weeks researching them and downloading/printing strategy
and song guides.  I agree completely, I would NEVER have tried out a bard
as a first character.

Too many things to learn and way too many different strategies involved
depending on the group.  But at level 11 now, I can twist 2 songs easy and
usually 3 with no probs, depending on lag.

...er, I still forget sometimes and STOP running to change songs.

Too used to my spell casters.    LOL
