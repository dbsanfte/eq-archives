Just a note... Raistlin never became a god. Because Caramon and Tasslehoff
traveled into the past to stop the future that they had traveled to from
occuring, Raistlin never succeeded in becoming a god. Caramon went to the
past about 3 days with Tasslehoff, convinced Raistlin after entering the
portal that if he became a god, Krynn would basically die, and Raistlin
handed his staff over to Caramon to close the portal. Raistlin then had a
very unpleasant time. I think it was Paladine that occured to Caramon in a
dream that Raistlin wasn't being tormented by Queen Takhisis... I think it
was because of Caramon's good deeds or some other such thing. During the
Chaos War, Raistlin was able to leave the Abyss, although he was robbed of
all of his magical abilities. After the war, I believe he departed back into
the Abyss.
Never thought when I actually posted something, it would be about something
completely unrelated to the thread/newsgroup ;).
