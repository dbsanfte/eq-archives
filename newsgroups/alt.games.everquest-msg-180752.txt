Does anyone know... if you Bind Wounds on a horse, do you keep meditating?

My cleric actually boosted BW to 100 or so until I decided not to bother
any more. For pretty much the reasons above - the time spent binding wounds
is much better spent medding for the next heal. The cheapest heal I
use routinely(*), Celestial Healing, costs 225 mana and heals 750 or so HP.
So call it 3HP per mana point... medding at around 20 mana per tick =
60 HP in six seconds.

If BW can be done from a horse without losing medding benefits, it
*might* occasionally be useful.

        ...Ronny

(*) OK, so Complete Heal is cheaper per point, for tanks anyway. But
Complete heal has a number of oddities.
