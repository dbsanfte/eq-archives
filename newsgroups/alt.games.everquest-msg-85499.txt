I did Dylin Starsine just before they made it harder by adding the red
wandering smuggler when I was level 19. Course, I had to wait in line. It
was a 13 hour camp and I was 3rd in line so I basically waited 40 hours to
get my page. Lots of coffee. That was a bad weekend. During that 40 hour
period, about 15 people popped into the area asking "when's dylin gonna
spawn i need him can i cut in plzkthks."
When told that they'd have to wait in line, most swore at us (in line) a few
times and said that's not fair, I cant log in that long, etc etc. Well too
bad. I waited my turn and so you will have to also. This was long before
before the play nice rules were even around. Just another reason to flee
from EQ screaming.
