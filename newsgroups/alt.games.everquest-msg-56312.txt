If I'm following your logic, then I assume you would not want monsters to stop
following at the zone-line as well.  They should just zone across and keep
following you seamlessly.  But I think a lot of people would much rather have a
few buffs drop at the zone then have to contend with monsters that can't be
evaded.  Of course I guess it would get rid of a lot of zone-line trains, since
there would be no advantage to zoning to escape creatures.  But can you imagine
someone training Meldrath or the Mino Hero all over Faydwer trying to escape
(as an example).  Or Cazel and a few of his Sand Giant comrades ending up in
Freeport wiping out a portion of the cities merchants and most low level PCs in
the area.

Come to think of it, that doesn't sound too bad ).  It would sure spice things
up if you never knew what to expect when entering a zone.

Just a thought,

Moriarty
