When I first read this, I thought "Hey, good idea!"  but then looking at the
keyboard, this places my pinky, rather than on the CTRL Key which is useful
in some games (albeit, not so much in EQ), but instead on the dreaded
Windows key.  Now I fully understand why ASDW works for moving around, gives
better access to all the other keys around it that are useful in game,
Shift, CTRL, Thumb can hit space and ALT rather easily, etc.

But still, a VERY good idea.
