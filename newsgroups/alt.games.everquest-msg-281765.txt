I appear to have quit again...

The last hurrah was the actual Raiding Game, whereby the following 
things occured:

* I obtained gear for little or no effort that trivialised the remaining 
parts of the grouping game that I had enjoyed
* I realised that actually being a good player meant nothing. The DKP 
system ensures that the guy with 200 fewer AA's than me and a tenth of 
my experience playing my class but who turns up to 20% more raids than I 
do will always be better geared.
* I realised that the raiding game is really quite monotonous, really 
low-skill for most players, and rewards robotic obedience over 
creativity 9 times out of 10.

Oh and then they replaced nektulos with something out of a video game, 
and brought out another expansion with another 50 tanking AA's to get 
that work exactly like the last 50 tanking AA's I got.

Waiting for Vanguard,
James
