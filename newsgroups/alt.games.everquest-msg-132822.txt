}6 of one, half a dozen of the other.
}Yes, it MIGHT protect them from pedophiles in the future.
}On the other hand, it also MIGHT deliver them into the pedophiles
}hands in the here and now...
}One could as easily happen as the other.

I think one is about a thousand times easier than the other, so I guess 
we'll have to agree to disagree.

}That is why the PARENTS must take a leading role in the toddlers
}education.

Now, if you could just convince all parents of that, and actualy get them 
to -do- it, we wouldn't even need an educational system.

But the fact is, they don't.  The majority don't even express an interest 
until we try to teach their precious babies something vaguely 
controversial like evolution, or school prayer.

So if something actually needs to get taught, waiting on the parents to do 
it may not be the best plan.  If the 'let the parents do it' plan worked, 
all these kids would already be informed on these issues and it would 
never even come up as an issue, would it?
