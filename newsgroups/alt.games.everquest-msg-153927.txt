I never said I 'could care less'. (And I never "attacked" the OP of
this thread)

Really? How so? Where am I telling anyone to do anything that I'm not
doing myself?

Adding "In my opinion" doesn't make it an opinion. Adding "I beleive"
makes it a theory or an assumption, neither of which are opinions.

Actually, that last one is either pure fabrication or yet more proof
that your vocabulary skills are lacking. There is a major difference
between an "insult" and a "criticism". While I do insult people,
actual insults most commonly come after they've responded to criticism
with hostility.
