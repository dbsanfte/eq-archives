And who's fault was that?

Gore is the one that pushed away liberals by acting too conservative. 
The majority of those who voted for Nader would tell you that they saw
no difference between Bush and Gore.  This is what happens when the
country becomes more conservative...more Republican, and the Democrats
are forced to start adopting conservative viewpoints to win
fence-sitter support.
