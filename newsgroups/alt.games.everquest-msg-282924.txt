Charm works? Tried a lot in the past like using Paci and monk Paci thing.  
Was unable to get it. Was doing the faction quest in OT like mad but was  
to boring (And expensive .. needed a DEF potion for hand ins).
When I gave up, I went to HS to get some exp and that ruined all faction  
work of weeks in about one day :)

So my prefered gate is the thurgadin gate potion ... but hammer is really  
nice ... works even in a fight because it is a proc :)
