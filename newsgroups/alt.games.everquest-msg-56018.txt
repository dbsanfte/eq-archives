Having half a raid fall into pits doesn't necessarily lead to everyone
else killing the dragon.. more like leads to a massive CR, since the
dragon didn't die.

Further, the stuff down in those pits gets trained out into the fight,
even if a couple people do this it can really jack up the rest of
the raid.  Remember, you've already identified these people as
unable to follow simple instructions; do you think you can count
on all of them to follow the common sense "if you fall in a pit,
die where you fall, and we'll get you out and res you after the
fight" plan?

Follow doen't necessarily work near pits... certainly not autofollow,
but even real follow in the laggy environment of a dragon raid.  If
you know what you are doing and where you are going, great, but
the trail of breadcrumbs seems like a very helpful idea... and at the
cost of a minute's time, and 20 coppers.
