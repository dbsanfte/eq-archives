Who said they're considering the test a saleable product? They are
considering it as a promotion for a saleable product, though. Sure,
you can twist it around to make it look like they're selling the beta,
but do enough twisting, and you can make it look like anything you
want.

Anyway, what's so outrageous about it? If you don't like it, don't
mess with it, that's all there is to it.
