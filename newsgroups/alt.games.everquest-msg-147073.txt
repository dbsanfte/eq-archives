Pardon, but I could be confused.... is this char a Druid, and if so...
I "thought" that druids cannot start to quad till 34 because of the
lack of spell to do the quad.... 
I have a druid that is 30 right now, and was under the impression (no
matter how wrong it may be)  that druids start to Quad at 34.

your time and response are appreciated.
