Well I didn't pay a lot of attention when it was linked, but it was some 
kind of item with +10 to a couple stats, and a clicky effect which gives 
you an aura, described to me as a sparkly effect similar to having your 
epic.

So, if you like, you can put up a graphics hogging effect for no reason 
other than to say "hey, I bought mine in the store!"

On a par with the item you get in GoD, which I did buy in store, and 
which my character has never worn (other than to get a look at it) as 
even at level 5 untwinked (starting on new server with no cash or 
friends) I had better things to do with whichever slot it fit in (I 
don't actually recall, probably range)
