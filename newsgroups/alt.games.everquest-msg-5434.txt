Velium weapons generally don't sell on our server.   Since I renewed my
account in mid January, I've only seen two people trying to sell them.  One
was asking some insanely high price, like 60 pp (Same stats as Combine plus a
proc, and those sell for 70 at vendors!)   I think the other was somewhere
between 10 and 20 pp.

Nobody else bothers.  Velious is a long ways away, and by the time you're
level 35 and able to take on the things that drop these weapons, a couple
extra plat is nowhere near worth the effort of selling them.   Also, it's not
really a feasible option for anyone except a wizard or a druid... and if they
were worried about the money at that level, they could make ten times as much
teleporting people around, so again, why bother?
