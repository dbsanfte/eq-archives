I've been going to Jaggedpine Forest lately to get baking supplies. I
normally never bake there but this time I did unfortunately.

Someone come running and ran up to me and just stood there. About 5
seconds later four or five potameids came running in after him at
which point he hightailed it to the teleporter which was only about 30
yards away. By the time I closed my packs they were back on me and I
was dead before I made it 20 steps.

I think he purposefully trained them onto me. Why else would he run up
to me and just stand there when the teleporter was in clear view ?
