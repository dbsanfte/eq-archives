Ok,moron is too hard,but when I want to sell stuff in Bazaar,I check
the prices of other vendors and see Grifoon meat for 70p and price
mine for 25p???

Its called supply and demand,and its up to you if you pay 10k for the
WMBS or wait until you find one for 5k.

And in the special case of baking ,I dont think 70 p is too much for 
a combine which can take you to 248 skill.
Have a look at tailoring,flawless hopper hides go for 300p and you
need some acrylia too,so people pay nearly 400p for 1 combine.
