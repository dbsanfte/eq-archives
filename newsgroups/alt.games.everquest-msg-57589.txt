Hmm, perhaps in a perfect world, but usenet isn't perfect. (Ask anyone 
who uses it regularly for binaries. Which is a different rant 
altogether.) There are no guarentees of messages arriving in the proper 
order, or even arriving at all. Remember usenet is (supposed to be) a 
discussion forum, where unlike email (usually), more than one person is 
reading your comments. They may not have seen the message in the thread 
preceeding yours.

On the other hand, based on your comment why did you bottom post in your 
reply to my message?
