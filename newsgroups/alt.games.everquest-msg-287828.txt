There's also magi at each of the LDON camps, one of which is in
Butcherblock near the zone-out to Greater Faydark.  The magi will
transport you to any other LDON camp, or to Nedaria's Landing.
The magus at Nedaria's Landing will send you to any LDON camp, or
to the ship parked in Abysmal Sea, or to Natimbi on the other side
of Abysmal Sea.  At some point they added the magus in the Guild
Lobby, who offers outbound ports to the LDON camps and Nedaria's,
but there is no corresponding inbound port from those.

There are also the teleporter gnomes.  Whenever the boats are so
broken that they can't be used, gnomes are posted to offer teleports
between the boat stops.  These days, this means virtually all boats,
all the time.  The boat from Butcherblock through Ocean of Tears to
(I think) Freeport is one, and it's extremely fast crossing Ocean of
Tears so is good for that.  Most of the other boats haven't been
operating for years, though every once in a while one of them may be
back in service for a week or so before vanishing again.
