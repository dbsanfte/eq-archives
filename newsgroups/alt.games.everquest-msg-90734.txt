The warrior has never gotten screwed for the 2 years I have been playing. I
used hear this from (ex) players  when I tell them something like how Verant
are implementing things trying to fix Rangers/Monks "what did they do for
the warrior?"
Nothing
"So once again Warriors get screwed"
Nope, Warriors are just how Verant want them, crap on their own. Good in a
group and after 55 nothing else will do as Main Tank.

As I said, the class is exactly as Verant wants it, it is group reliant. As
much as I often wish it was not.
As for corpse retrievals, yes Warriors suffer that the worst, no invis, FD,
ports or speed buffs but giving the warrior any of these would only upset
anyone playing other classes, Pally's complaining we get an invis, SK's
complaining we get a heal, Rogues complaining that we get an FD or rangers
complaining we get a port etc, although to be honest I really don't think
Verant give a shit if players are whining about a class, they only fix/nerf
something that they see as wrong, not what we whine about.
Self bind isn't a problem now, since soul binders have been put in.

If I could do anything to Warriors then it'd be the ability to convert
stamina bar to health, totally fatigueing the player but healing much faster
(similar to canabalise for Shaman) useless in a fight but would reduce
downtime for any Warrior that fancied trying his hand a solo'ing. Anything
else, more damage more health etc would just unbalance the game, of course
they'd have to give the same ability to Rogues, at least, seeing as they
suffer the same problem as Warriors (except they have an easier time of CR)

Can't port to Luclin I don't mind but some Druid/Wiz rings on there would be
nice...
