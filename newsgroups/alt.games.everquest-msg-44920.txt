Me too (like some braindead AOLer.)

Didn't get it, but people reported it in LOIO while Shrouds was there.

Then -did- see it in Kael Drakkar while Bergh was there... and I
can assure you noone was using bind wounds nearby.

If bind wounds somehow transmits the symbols zone wide, then
Shrouds would have seen em in LOIO, while on the other hand
Bergh was seeing them while noone in his group was injured
sufficiently to make bind wounds possible, and everyone was
busy anyway.

Particularly recall seeing them at the beginnings of pulls, as though
it was the text for "I'm gonna get you sucka" and "You Alcoholics
have ruined your own land, you'll not ruin mine"
