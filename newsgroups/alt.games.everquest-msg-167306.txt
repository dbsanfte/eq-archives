The stat food does not need to be in main inventory, just has to be the
first slot with food/drink in it.  I put them in the first couple of slots
of my first bag.  I don't keep any main inventory slots permanently open, so
I have to swap in food/drink and consume it.  Alternatively, since those
stat foods last so long anyway, just buy a stack of each every few weeks or
so.
