First key, or atleast in my mind, is the addition of RAM isn't ALWAYS going
to help you in every application/game.  Sure, the addition of RAM is nice as
it will effectively reduce the number of accesses your computer makes to the
much slower hard drive (as in compared to RAM), though, thats LOADING
itself.  The appearance which I suppose could somewhat be supported by the
new "Loading this, that, etc.." EQ splash screen, is that EQ loads the
character models, world (such as what zones connect to what, etc, not
necessarilly the zone features itself), the armor, etc, etc. into RAM (or as
much of it as it can) however, it is the transfer of information from the
RAM to the processor where the processor itself takes on an important role.

Another thing is whether or not your PIII 600 is a PIII 600E or 600EB.  The
E will run (unless overclocked) at a 100 MHz FSB (Front Side Bus) while the
EB runs at a 133 MHz FSB.  This too will decide over all system performance,
hence speed/performance of EQ.

A PIII 600 with 320MB of RAM should run decently, however, I wouldn't
recommend (as others too have noted) to run ALL the new character models.
Given your system is comparable with one that I run EQ on other than the
processor speed (one I use is an 866 with 133 FSB) I would recommend only
turning on maybe 5 new models at most.  I didn't care for the new models at
all (sorry, I've got a thing against change for some reason) so I turned all
but the Elemental/Vah Shir models to FALSE (or off).

If you are asking this question to assist in your decision to get SoL or
not, yes, I would get it.  Worst case scenerio is that you would have to
turn off all the new models.  <shrug> (no loss in my opinion).

PS - As for video cards themselves.. hehe, I am most certainly ignorant to
give recommendations there.  I wasn't much a gamer until I first got my
hands on EQ. <grin> (thats either a good thing or a bad thing)
