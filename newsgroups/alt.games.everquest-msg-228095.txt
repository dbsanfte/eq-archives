You know, I've heard this a lot, and I've always wondered about it.

If you think EQ weddings are silly, why on earth does the two people
involved being married IRL have anything to do with its silliness?  Why do
they achieve some level of respectability higher because the two people are
married than they would had the two people just been friends living across
the country from one another?

As for me, I've never really thought about it, and wonder why it's a big
deal to some people who don't "get it".

Don't think I'm directing this at you specifically, Rumble.
