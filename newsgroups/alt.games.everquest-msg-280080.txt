Must be something wrong, I am agreeing with you far too much lately. :b

If you are in a guild, and the guild raids, then your guild should be 
heavily encouraging you to get that epic 1.0, not to mention, they should 
be helping you get it.  It is such a huge timesaver for recovering from 
wipes.

As far as faction issues, you can work around that if you are not really 
needed for healing on the fight in Chardok.  Just die, get dragged, get 
rezzed in when the fight is over and loot up.
