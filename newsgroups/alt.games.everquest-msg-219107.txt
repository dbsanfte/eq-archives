First, well duh.

Second, in spite of that, you're still not really looking at the root,
though you think you are.

The key element is hitpoints.  The entire game can be summed up by you, me,
and everybody else needing to have enough hitpoints to live through a fight. 
Nukers reduce the amount of hitpoints the mobs take.  Healers give hitpoints
back.  CC keep extra mobs from having the chance to take even more hitpoints
away "for free".

Or, to put it another way, I could play this game without mana.  It'd be a
far different game, but would be playable as it stands right now if mana
ceased to exist.  Now, try that without hitpoints.

Mana regen just helps you keep ahold of those hitpoints.
