   Well, I know this going to sound egotistical, but my favorite type of
loot system is were Lenny masterloots, and I sell then split, minus the
cost of dots for all save Lenny and I.  This is because I know I am
fair, and that no one is going to get screwed out of anything.  The
problem with this, of course, is that unless the rest of the party knows
me well, there is no compelling reason to assume that this is so.  

   FFA play nice is ok too, provided everyone really pays attention to
the Play Nice part.  And if I notice that the mage hasn't looted in a
couple of cycles, and I do try to pay attention to that sort of thing, I
will tell the group "Splend next loot."  But I am not perfect, and if
someone has to be told every time, then yes, they are probably going to
get a lesser share.

   Alpha is my least favorite.  I got better things to do than keep
track.  And it is easy for someone to get screwed by a bad run with the
random generator.  Unless other provisions are made for the dots, then
the cleric will pretty much always get screwed.  However, I also dislike
the "system" of the cleric looting everything regardless of dot expense,
and pocketing the difference, to hell with everyone else.  No, this
isn't a system... this is robbery.

   Whatever the case, I think it is the leader of the group who has the
responsibility for making sure that a loot system is agreed upon in
advance before the first mob falls.  If someone leaves the group feeling
screwed, that group leader bears a large part of the fault (unless the 
ML is someone besides the leader whom all trust who sudden goes insane
and makes off with the take).
