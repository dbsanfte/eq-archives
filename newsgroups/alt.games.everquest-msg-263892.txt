Doesn't have to cost more, I'm all in favor of letting tradeskillers break 
even on resales to vendors, that's a sufficient compromise imo.

By the way, I don't believe for a minute that this system will prevent the 
IGN drones from macroing, nor does the dev team. Contrary to what many are 
saying, this system was not designed to prevent macroing, it was designed to 
be a more interactive and engaging crafting system that provides the 
crafting analog to combat. This interactivity will prevent casual macroing, 
but I don't believe for a minute that it will prevent the IGN guys from 
macroing a simple combine using 100% vendor-purchased materials that does 
nothing but generate plats. I expect it.
