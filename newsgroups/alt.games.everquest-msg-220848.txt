So how do you roleplay?

My Iksar necro speaks in... Lizardman (We call it Iksar). She ask for
a SoW in Iksar, when they druid complains I usually respond:
/em makes a wolf imitation with her hands to her head, points to her
feet, and makes a toothy grin.

If my guildmates want to talk to me I can teach it to them, no
problem. I explain that I know common, but I dont like softskins, and
I am bothered when I drop to thier tongue. Many other Iksar are
bemused, but the best part is the doods in the PoK. It interrupts the
min/maxing they do to get maximum level with minimum effort.

I know a lot agree when I say this game isn't about leveling it is
about having fun...
