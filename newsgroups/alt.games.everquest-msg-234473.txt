Pushing a mob into a wall is _not_ a good plan in many places, MMC
included.  The only real "train" I've ever seen in LDoN was due to
a mob being pushed through a wall.

The secret to dealing with pushy pets (and pushy PCs for that matter)
is to get them all on one side of the mob.  Not the front, not the rear,
but the side.  As they push the mob the tank simply edges a tiny bit in
the opposite direction, adjusting his facing to keep the mob in front
of him.  The mob, and the PCs and pets pushing it, just circle round and
round the tank.  Rogues don't kick, so let them have the mob's back to
themselves as kick and procs seem to be the main push culprits.

Puller just needs to avoid making things hard, tank needs to understand
that he's the cobbler's bench, the pets are monkeys, and the mob's the
weasel.

Aye, the next Ranger or Druid or Wizard who casts a knockback stun in
one of my groups is gonna get an earful.  There is just about nothing
stupider than trashing your group's non-pet melee DPS with knockbacks
(not to mention pushing mobs into range of healers and/or close enough
to other mobs to get adds).  Doing it when you've got a Paladin in the
group stunning the casters is even more stupid.  I'm about ready to
stop grouping with Rangers (in LDoN pickup groups anyway).
