Hi,
The amount of time that the Den Mother and House Orge have put into
making EQtraders what it is is incredable. From whats been posted on
the EQtraders board and what i personally feel is that the Denmother
is entitled to spend the donations money on what she wishes , she
stated before and after ( which she didnt need to do ) what the money
would be going on so i dont see an issue with it.
Too play Luclin ( many EQ players have had to quit as the requirements
where bumped up serverly for it ) you require at least 256mb of Ram,
for the Denmother to test and validate any of these recipes she would
need that memory to log into the game and then prove that these
recipes work before she is able to fully integrate them onto her site.
Also most of the things required for the trade skills are drop only ,
these drops also need to be proven so she would need to adventure to
find these out also,
The cost to run and the time she has put into EQtraders is an obscene
amount of time and instead of forcing people to pay she put a donation
button up , letting everyone know before hand where the money. Though
as she posted a high percentage went into running the website itself.
