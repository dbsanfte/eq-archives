They can solo just fine.  As well as any other non-solo classes and better
than some.

The trouble is; either you're a grouping enchanter or soloing.  It's damned
hard to be good at both.  I really don't EVER want to group with an
enchanter who says "oops, I forgot to mem mezz" (something really not needed
for soloing).

If outdoors, Fear Kiting with animation works pretty well if you know the
pathing.  Of course there's the ol' charm fighting if you trust charm
farther than you could throw an ogre (I don't).
