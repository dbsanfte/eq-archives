Hi all,

Had a look into doing the luclin armor quest for my L40 cleric today. Spent
alot of time running around various zones and trying to figure out where the
various mobs are (as well making a few corpse runs). I also read alot of
posts at alakhazam and there seems to be the opinion that these quests are
not only long and hard but more often than not obtaining the final item for
each piece is nigh on impossible. Before I make a start on these with my 40
cleric I just wondered if there were any thoughts about these quests and
their worth? Have many people completed them? I am a new player so I dont
have much pp to buy armor but would I be better farming some cash instead?
Thanks.

Andrew
