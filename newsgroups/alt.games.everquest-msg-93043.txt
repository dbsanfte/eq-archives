I spent a good 10 minutes in Erudin the other day looking for the Soulbinder
so to save those of you who don't know some time, she's in the middle
hallway of the docks area.

I was so sure she was in the Palace or the main city area that when I
couldn't find her I assumed Erudin didn't have one and I only spotted her by
accident as I was leaving in disgust for Qeynos!

D'oh!
