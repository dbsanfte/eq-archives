If you would just think about it, you would realize you are not being
set back by a random person coming along and finishing off a 49 or
less percent health mob.  You get exp sooner, have less healing to do,
and you can go on to your next mob to keep getting skill up.

Now if someone stops off and starts doing this with every mob, then
yes, your skills will lag behind your current level, but when you get
to around lvl 15, you level so damn slow that you would have maxed all
your skills before you hit your first yellow bub of exp.  So even if
you do lag behind in low lvls, the mobs are very easy to kill then,
and you will catch up in a couple levels anyway.  In the long run, you
save time!!

If this was a case where a guy stopped off and wanted to hang around
and kill off all your pulls over and over again, then you have the
right to get angry, but if he just stopped off on his way somewhere
and helped you finish off one kill, then you should thank him and let
him be on his way (maybe throw in a role play comment like: "Thank you
kind sir, I think I can handle them from now on... good luck to
you!").  He did you a favor (even if you are too dumb to realize it)
and you should be thankful of that. 

And to clear something up... since you dont seem to know a whole lot
about eq... if you do 51% or more damage to a mob and a guy comes
along and kills it for you, you get exp, and you get the right to loot
the corpse instantly.  The person who gets the exp gets the loot, so
you didn't have to wait around for your little 1 silver piece, you
could have looted it right then.

And just to give you a heads up if you actually make it to higher
levels (which I doubt) when a higher lvl caster casts a damage spell
on a mob you are killing, then even if the spell only did 5% damage,
the high lvl caster gets the kill.  High lvl people should only help
with melee or with pets, never spells.

Now go, Ryouseika, and continue your pointless journy of complication
and irritation...  "Your Irritation skill has gone up! (195)"
