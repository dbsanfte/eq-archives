I thought all the linked mobs were also locked to the encounter, 
preventing any of them from being attacked by players outside the 
attacking group.

If I were to guess, I'd say you would have to wait until they were back 
to 100% with all debuffs/dot's worn off. I haven't taken note of the 
circumstances of those occurrances, though. 

It does seem that if you zone away from a mob, it will path back to it's 
spawn point/post without aggroing onto other players along the way.
