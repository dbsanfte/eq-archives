  What other stuff did they change?  Aside from the new skeleton/wolf
models and the newly introduced terrible performance, I notice no
changes.

  I'm not convinced that if they improve performance for one type of
system configuration, it won't potentially hurt performance for
someone else.  I recently read an interview with somebody at NVIDIA,
and they were discussing the methods they use to create and optimize
drivers... and one of the things they mentioned is that it isn't
necessary that they are optimizing the drivers to result in better
performance across the board, but rather a matter of experimenting
with different compromises to try to figure out which set of
compromises offers the best overall performance.

  Maybe comparing writing drivers to coding a game engine is like
comparing apples to oranges.  I don't know.  But when the biggest
"upgrade" to their game engine in over a year results in such
strikingly worse performance on my machine, I'm not inclined to take
an overly optimistic view of other changes, optimizations and upgrades
to come.
