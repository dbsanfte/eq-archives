I've brought up this topic a few times recently, desperately looking for
bronze armor for my barbarian warrior (soon to be 18).  I've spent very much
time running around across Norath from one zone to another following "I
think" or "I've heard".  I went to Unrest only to be told that all bronze
there is too small for me and much of it too small for even humans to wear.
I was even shown a piece.  Then I met someone in that zone who was only LV20
and wanted to take me to Najena to hunt because bronze drops there (off the
Ogre he said).  So I went to go look.  I killed the ogre and only got some
rusty weapon.  I even met someone who said that they've killed him many
times and NEVER seen bronze.  I've also been told about Lavastorm.  The guy
in Najena (LV60) said to try Mistmore.  But I don't want to run back across
the continent and boat ride only to be told "no, not here...try....".  Where
can I REALLY get bronze armor that is safe for a LV17 Barbarian Warrior to
go to (might even be alone)?  Or where can I buy some (EC and all nearby
zones haven't had much luck)?
