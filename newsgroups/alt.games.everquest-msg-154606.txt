I see that my alt exp for innate regen is going to be refunded with
this next patch.  By some chance is this being done to revamp some
calculation bug and I will be able to put my alt exp back into
increasing my innate regen?  Or, as I suspect, is this doing away with
innate regen for alt exp?  Since that's what I got the alt exp for in
the first place, I wonder if I can get that put toward level exp if
the innate regen is going away.  Doesn't that sound fair?  Well as
fair as one might expect under such circumstances.
