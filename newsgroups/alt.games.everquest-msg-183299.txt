That's a large part of the reason you're not getting skillups. None of 
your fights take as long as they should, therefore you are levelling much 
faster than your skills will improve.

Intentionally choosing low damage/low delay weapons and twinking my AC, I 
was able to get all my weapon skills except 2HB maxxed on my iksar SK by 
level 13. You have to sacrifice a bit of levelling rate to accomplish 
that though, sticking to blues and evens. It does get easier the higher 
your offense skill gets, I believe.

They say that your melee skills will catch up in later levels anyway and 
that it's not a major concern at low levels, but I can't imagine starting 
a skill at 1 when I get to level 30 or so. Blue mobs would eat me for 
breakfast.
