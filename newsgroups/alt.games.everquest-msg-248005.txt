Not really, although it's still fairly early in the game's life and there's
not much known about the high end. There are Trials, for example, that
require 50 players from the same guild, and I've yet to meet anyone who even
knows about them, let alone tried one. I'm not sure what kind of planning or
requirements exist for those.

CoH doesn't have tradeskills, or other non-xp timesinks but it does have a
unique feature that compensates to some extent. It's called Sidekicking, and
it allows any player of level 10 or higher, to become the Mentor of a
sidekick, who can be of any level. Let's say I'm level 20 and you are level
8. You and I want to group, but we're too far apart for normal grouping, so
I sidekick you and you accept. This raises your HP, your offensive power and
your defenses to match roughly a level 16 player. Through sidekicking, there
are substantially fewer barriers to friends grouping together despite level
differences. It's a pretty cool system. Last night I sidekicked Danny's
level 8 Blaster while my wife and I were dinging from 17 to 18. Worked just
fine.
