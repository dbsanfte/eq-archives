I think the Troll and Ogre shammys hate each other, I know the Bst's, and
SK's have a problems with each other, as I found out oneday while binding my
baby Ogre Beasty in Grobb, died 8 times in a row before I finally ran far
enough to get out of aggro range =)

You could always create an alt however, other than that if you on Karana,
Prexus, or AB I can fetch them for you.
