I was wondering the first time, and now I'm wondering again, *why* are you
posting an irrelevant snippet from the documentation?

Try this:

BackgroundMaxFPS=30 -- This is the maximum framerate (in frames per second)
for BACKGROUND EQ sessions.  Background is any EQ session you're NOT
actively using.
Generally, you don't need as high of a framerate in the background. Keep in
mind that the lower this number is, the less accurate your movement will be,
so you don't want it too low either.  Also, MMOTools subscribers can take
advantage of the "Rendering" settings, which allow background sessions to
have a HIGHER framerate than the foreground, while using LESS processing
time.

Note how this is exactly what Moopy described, and how this is exactly what
the free version still provides. The rendering part is only useful to people
who're multiboxing, and yes they do have to pay for those features now, but
it has never been relevant to this discussion.
