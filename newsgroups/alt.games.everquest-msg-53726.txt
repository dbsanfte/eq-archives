Except that Pallys can buff (not as well as Clerics and Droods, but it can
come in handy) as well as rez later in life.  Also, I've saved quite a few
kiesters with a well timed LoH.

Hmm, I've had a warrior pull my butt out of the fire on many occasions.
Good for pulling of aggros and stuff.  Heck, I've even had a Rouge help me
with a drive-by Backstabbing.

That just leaves SK's, and frankly, I'm scared to piss them off, since you
never know what they'll do.  ^__^

I usualy go with the rule, if they con yellow or above, consider it a
courtesy to ask first.  If they're blue, then it's your call.
