I'm currently growing a druid to use as a buff whore for my beastlord (31)
and monk (54). Using Befriend Animal (lvl 14) I've gone from 14 to 30, and
still going using that handy little permarooted teddy, Bloodmaw. The Feral
Kodiaks have just started turned white, so still a load of Savage and
Ferocious in the area. Should keep me happy until 34, but my target is 39.
I'm still getting 2% a kill, so won't be moving for a couple of levels yet.
I've died twice (both times moving too close to the point where the 2
kodiaks spawn inside the wall - bit of a pain when you've pulled 2 already
:-) but regained the xp within 3 kills or so.

Shame Corudoth isn't charmable, would have headed to Iceclad next :-)

On my first druid, I used to charm griffons in the karanas. They make lovely
pets, and as long as you keep the target mob rooted and yourself SoW'd,
charm breaking isn't as big a problem as some would believe. Once the pet is
low enough healthwise, break the charm (hide/camo) and kill it yourself, and
go and get another pet. Hunt by the bridge between east and north karana,
and if things go pear shaped, there's a handy zone line.

If you really want a pet though, try a beastlord.
