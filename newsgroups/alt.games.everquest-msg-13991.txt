I would recommend North Karana.  You can kite the beetles, plus
highland lions.  You've also got a good amount of wisps around, so if
you get any GLS's, you can turn them in for the quest at the Gypsies
and make about10p each.  As you move up a few levels, 18ish, there are
other beetles to fight, also Griffawns to "fear" kite.  You've also
got the guard tower to run to if you aggro
