I have killed Boabob twice and Chanda Miller once and want to undo the 
faction hits so ive been killing bandits in west karana.
However having killed more bandits now than i killed the millers its 
bovious that faction isnt reversed one for one.
With this in mind i was wondering how many bandits im likely to have to 
kill to get my faction good enough so im not attacked on sight by the 
millers.
I think the message currently says scowls at you or glares at you, cant 
remember which when i con them
