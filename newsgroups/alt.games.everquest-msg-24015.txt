Taunt isn't solely based on damage.  Hell, I can taunt a mob off
someone without ever doing a single point of damage to them.  There's
different aggro patterns in the game, learn what they are and how to
generate aggro for each and you learn 90% of what it takes to kill big
mobs.

Barring totally unequal equipment and levels, a rogue will outdamage
all classes across the board.  Not by a small amount, but by a HUGE
amount.

There's a reason why I drag 9 to 12 rogues to a dragon hunt--I want
that damn dragon dead fast.

You're 4 levels above him.
You con *RED* to him.  You bloody better well do more damage or you
just plain suck.  Get a level 45 rogue, drop a comparable weapon on
him, then pick on a fairly high hitpoint mob and tell me he doesn't do
more damage, you would be lying through your teeth.
