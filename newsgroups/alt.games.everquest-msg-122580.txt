No, and I think you'll find that one of my original contributions to
this thread I said that I could understand the request for people
watch their language, though I also said that I can understand why
people wouldn't want to also.

Is there anywhere, aside from the rare scorched earth flame, that
you've actually seen the overuse of profanity on a.g.e?

Please.  Cussing is not the same as vandalism, they aren't even
moderately the same.  Hearing a 'bad' word has no effect on the
listener that the listener does not LET it have.

>I agree there are times when it makes sense and contributes to the

Once again, how much 'casual overuse of profanity' really exisits here
on a.g.e and was a request for us to watch our potty mouths really
warranted?

Do I cuss as much around my grandmother as I do around my friends?
No, but that's because I tend to still feel like I'm 7 around my
grandma.

Actually, cussing can be, quite often, the best way to get your point
across.  Kind of a verbal exclamation point.

I wouldn't be uncomfortable around that conversation.  Even if I
didn't agree with the way the person was expressing himself.  There
are some ideas that would make me VERY uncomfortable, but words
themselves, without context, don't have that power.
