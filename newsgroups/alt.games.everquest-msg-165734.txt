Just check your CoV faction first. Since your friend is a wizard, port
into CS invisibly and have the wizard reinvis also. (Usually, and I must
stress "usually" there are no mobs at the portal unless somebody has
kited or trained them over.) Target a drake or a wyvern, any one will
do, run to a safe distance and uninvis to check con. If you are cool
there, Woushi won't bother you.

Remember also that, on most servers, if it's more than a day since the
last patch the odds of Woushi being up are very slim. I've seen him
twice in two years. He's highly sought after by velious dragon capable
guilds.

Running through Kael (while silly, IMO, if you have a wizard with you)
is certainly doable, providing you have a map and go the right way. You
can run from EW all the way to WL without crossing one see-invis giant
if you take the direct route. (Again, this assumes no raid party has
trained the arena or Tormax areas to zone.) Just be careful when you get
down towards the bank. Those tunnels can be confusing and most maps I've
seen can be a bit misleading. If you make a turn onto a wrong ramp or
tunnel, you may wind up at the arena or Riff house, and there *are*
see-invis giants there who will likely take issue with your having
killed so many of their brethren in EW and treat you in a rude fashion.
:-)

What were you planning on hunting in WL by the way?
