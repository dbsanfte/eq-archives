Actually, "in general" it does.  Thus why I can say "7 year olds generally
don't get pregnant" and nobody can (even semantically) argue it, at least
while retaining any sort of dignity.  =)

"Specifically" or "technically" they may be able to in the future.  But then
your "quite simple" definition now has to deal with an additional caveat,
and isn't quite so simple anymore.  For instance, is it now "a group of
biological organisms capable of interbreeding and creating fertile
offspring, or that has the potential to mature to be so capable"?  That
describes a fetus from the moment of conception.  Whee.  Be careful with
creating or "interpreting" definitions.

As was pointed out in someone else's post, a dead human is still
biologically/genetically human.  Interestingly enough, there are more laws
protecting dead people than there are protecting newly created people.

Sorry, once you feel that the "meanings of definitions" are important, it's
a purely semantic argument.  =)

It's really not that hard, as long as you don't go around making up
definitions to suit your argument.  It also really helps when you don't use
the very definition of a word to argue whether the word is defined the same
as the definition of the word indicates it should be defined.  That pretty
much sums up this whole part of the discussion.  =)
