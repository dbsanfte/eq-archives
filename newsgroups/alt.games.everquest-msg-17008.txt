There is a wide diversity of opinion on this.  I feel that it is 
appropriate to post using only the simplest format (ie, text) so as to 
maintain compatibility with the most possible newsreaders.

If you post in HTML, there are actually quite a few newsreaders that will 
present the innocent reader of your post with a screenful of garbage.  
Losing quite a few potential readers, to me, hardly seems worth it if all 
I gain is the ability to specify what font they see and underline or 
boldface stuff, or include clickable links.

And if it's HTML with pictures... Well, that's just evil.
