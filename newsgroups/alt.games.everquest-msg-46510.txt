Swimming to the Firepots is absolutely your best transportation
option on norrath at this point.  You won't have to tangle with
anything, there are no mobs in the water.  Just stay clear of the
islands (Raptor isle is the one to watch, you are correct there)

The roaming dragon was nerfed quite some time ago, he is
now spawn only, over in the hidden inn, and I very much
doubt anyone on the server is yet capable of spawning him.

Course to get back to your body should you die, you'll
have to make the swim again... unless you've completed
your mission, banked everything, and then gotten someone
to duel you: warriors gate, we call it.
