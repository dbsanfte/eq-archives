Thank you.  Really really really -- thank you for the wonderful post

I've soloed my main and pretty much only character, a Druid, all the way to
46 with no meaningful group experience.  (Please, I'm a nice person, don't
rant on me about this....)  Mainly this is because when I've tried to group,
and explain to folks that I need them to really explain what I should do,
they *never* do.  And of course, it gets harder the higher you go.  It seems
rude to me at this point to group when I don't have the slightest clue what
to do.
