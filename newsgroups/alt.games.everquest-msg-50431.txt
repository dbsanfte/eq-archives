When someone says whatever you feel is appropriate, they usually mean
just that. I don't know how much someone has to donate for a rez and I
do not wish to bankrupt anyone. However if some level 55 warrior with
his epic gives me 20pp for a rez I'll feel cheated. If some level
thirty died in hell and its someones main, he very well may not have a
plat and I'll happily rez for free. But I don't know how well off he
is, it may be someones twink who already has multiple 60 level
characters, hence the "donate what you feel is appropriate" line.
