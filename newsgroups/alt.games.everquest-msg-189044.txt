True, we will set up new oil deals with Iraq, it would be absurd not to.
However, I still can't believe you guys think this is a naked oil grab.  If
we were going to do that, there are far better places to get it from (we
could quite easily justify going into Saudi, given the nationality makeup of
the 9/11 terrorists, and the Saudi government's complicity, and they have
even more oil than Iraq).  The fact is, or government knows what WE gave
Saddam years ago, and has a pretty good idea of what France and Russia gave
them; couple that with his promises to destroy us, and we have a situation
where allowing him to stay in power could be considered quite irresponsible.
You can agree or disagree about the strength of the threat, and whether or
not it justifies a war, but please drop the oil bit.  There are far better
arguments against the war that aren't as superficial.

No, but France is doing whatever they can to block our action.  If France
really believed that their action did nothing, they wouldn't veto our
resolution.  The fact that we maintain enough national soverignty to take
action on our own (and thanks to the Brits, Aussies, and Polish, we don't
have to) doesn't mean France didn't try to stop us.

Because I've heard the statements of your leaders and your people.  It's not
just disagreement.  Granted, it's mostly aimed at Dubya, but considering 76%
of us support him, the animosity must be distributed amongst us, as well.

You may want to look into the message y'all are sending, then, because
that's sure how it looks over here.

My stars, if that's what you think is America, I'm suprised y'all haven't
declared war on us!  Hell, Leatherman is the best out of the four, and even
that suxx0rz compared to Gerber tools.

He may have been defeated, but that doesn't mean he remained that way.  We
didn't finish the job, and he didn't disarm.  Kinda funny how Blix was
shocked that Saddam had Scud missles.  Hmm, I wonder what else he had that
Blix didn't know about...

It's not all paranoia.  Y'all see us as paranoid, we see you as blind and
naive.
