OK, you haven't played since before Velious was released, so you are
still worrying about overcrowding, which has been largely alleviated.
(The overcrowding that exists now is in zones that give good, easy exp
to characters level 55+.)
There is only one new, young server, but based on your IP address and
phrasing, I assume you are in the UK.  The new Kane Bayle server was
installed a couple months ago, as a brand-new server, hosted in
Amsterdam.  There is also the Antonius Bayle server which is hosted in
London, but that server is largely populated by high-level characters
who transferred from other servers.  I know that my server lost two
complete guilds to AB, and from discussions which friends who
transferred, it was very much dominated by several large guilds from
day one.
With the expansions and the revamp of many of the original zones,
overcrowding isn't the problem that old time players remember.  Some
of the special rules servers have found that being undercrowded is
even more problematic than being overcrowded.  
Basically, if the server ends in Zek, it's PvP, if it ends in Bayle
it's in Europe, and all other servers are pretty much the same, except
for Firiona Vie.  Firiona Vie is the roleplay preferred server, which
has a number of different rules than the regular servers.  Some
highlights include language restrictions (no common, start out
speaking racial language, etc), almost no no-drop items, trivial loot
code (any item flagged magic or lore will not drop if the mob is green
to you), and exp penalties/bonuses based on faction of your group
members.

Well, druids and necros are still very powerful soloers, but are not
as desired at the end game as some other classes.  Basically any class
is useful throughout much of the game, but there is a definate
emphasis on tank/healer/crowd-control, to the point where many people
refer to Warrior, Cleric, and Enchanter to be the Holy Trinity.  
The changes made in Kunark and Velious definately tilted the balance
towards melee classes, as better weapons and armor became available
and then ubiquitious.  There have been some recent changes to casters
which seem to have made them more useful, especially in the end-game.
The class balancing team has worked on melee and casters, with hybrids
probably next, and bards last.
