No one snatched th name, as i mentioned i my original post it was just 
deleted but i couldnt reuse the name because of they sometimes keep hold

else could get it

I shouldnt have to, Verant should fix there fucked up naming system that 
rejects most things, even its own suggested names a lot of the time.
