A message from Customer Service

There have been some rumors spreading around the net like a wildfire over
the last few days. Alan Crosby has asked me to pass this message on to you
about those rumors.

  Greetings all,

Rest assured that there is no plan to institute a "pay for Customer Service"
model. We have a large staff of over 70 GMs and Supervisors for EverQuest
alone and plan to continue with the same level of Customer Support, as part
of the purchase price for all of our soon to be released titles.

Customer service will always be an integral part of SOE's products and while
we may not respond to every issue as rapidly as we would like, we do try to
resolve them all in time. If you find that your issue has not been responded
to, please use the Contact a GM link on the EverQuest board. These emails
are generally responded to within 48 hours thanks to the diligence of our
Email GMs. In addition, while GMs are available in limited numbers 24 hours
a day, you may have the best chance of contact during peak usage hours which
are from 5PM to 8PM PST as this is when most GMs are available.

Thanks for your time and patronage.

Alan Crosby
Customer Service Manager
EverQuest Games
