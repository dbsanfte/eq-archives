If you're in EC, take the tunnel to NRo, then south to Oasis. As you
run along the shore in Oasis (NOT NRo, there's a dock there to
Velious), you'll come to a dock with some buildings by it. Get on the
raft at the dock, and it will take you out to Timorous Deep. Get off
the raft, go around the rocks on the right, and you'll see a dock
surrounded by a bunch of ogres that are KOS to you. If you're in luck,
someone will be camping a named mob there called Oowomp, and can kill
the ogres around the docks for you while you wait for the boat. If
not, swim out to the boat while it's docked, being careful not to get
in aggro range. Ride the boat to Overthere, then as soon as it zones
in, hop off and swim for shore outside the outpost. Follow the
shoreline until you hit the zone wall, then follow the zone wall to
the Warslisk Woods zone. Zone in, and follow the right wall until you
get to Cabilis. From there you can get to LoIO. Note, unless someone
is going to walk you to Cabilis, DO NOT TAKE A PORT! The only ports to
Kunark are in Dreadlands and Emrald Jungle, both of which will kill
you right quick if you aggro anything. It would also be a good idea to
print out some maps from www.eqatlas.com
