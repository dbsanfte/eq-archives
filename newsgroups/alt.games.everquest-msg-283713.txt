Yup.  If you want to Find them, use the "melee augmentations" entry in
the Find menu.

Aye, very true.

They're pretty handy for my Ranger, as his weapons have an 80 proc
anyway at lvl 40, plus the Spell proc (Ack, I forget - I think it's
called "Call of the Sky"??) for about 35, so adding a couple of these
to the weapons will give me a bit more clout. THREE procs per weapon
soon add up, I would think!
