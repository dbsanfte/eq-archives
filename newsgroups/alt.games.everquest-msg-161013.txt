It became worth it the moment I bought it just because the city ports make
it worth it.  So far I've popped down to Feerrot to farm Spiderling silks,
ported into Freeport to do a part of my epic then bopped on over to Qeynos
for another part of my epic, gated into Shadeweavers Thicket for Shadeling
Silk for the Rallic Pack quest, and zoned into Everfrost to pick up my new
spells.  Not to mention random popping, bopping, porting and zoning just to
see where it takes me.
