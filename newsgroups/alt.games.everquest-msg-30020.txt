What bothers me isn't that I might get killed by something green, but 
doesn't exp go by what they con?  So the first time I went to fight a 
griffawn, it was green (at 19 :)) and I almost got my butt kicked - my 
thought wasn't "I hate Verant for making him look green when he's not", 
my thought was "you mean even if I *could* take the punishment this thing 
deals out, I wouldn't get even an ounce of exp from it?"  I know it gets 
like that in higher levels.  I just don't like it :)
