Thing with skeletons is that lowbies get killed, i have seen many high
level people run trough nektulos picking up a few skeletons on the
way,most have sow or j-boots so they never even notice, but the poor
newbie that get's in the way does :(

I myself had a zombie chasing me at one time, stoped to check and
there he was, glad i noticed before i trained someone  :(

Of to the game now and let's see if WC still is refered to as a
howling nightmare :)
