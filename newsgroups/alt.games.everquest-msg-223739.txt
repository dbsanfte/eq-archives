Jaggedpine is prolly the safest place you can find. You can do the 
basilisks in the gnoll (non-kos) cave, or grifs out in the forest.

If you wolf form the grifs won't be kos and can med safely out there,
tho it'd be a good idea to just pull them close to the city, as they are 
social.

With the basilisks I never saw them add even when they ran close to each 
other. The Genitors are kos and seemed to be the only ones that did the 
basilisk stun, and I think it was a melee proc so you should be fine as 
long as you stay outta their melee range. They usually drop a fair amount 
of eggs you can sell in the bazaar.
