God, man.  Have you no sympathy?  I *like* EQ.  Why do you have to go around
destroying my complacency by showing me games so much better than EQ (didn't
even know it was possible!)?  You're going to destroy my life.  My
girlfriend is going to leave me.  I'm going to lose my job.  I'm going to
lose my apartment because I'll forget to pay the rent.  I'm going to be
homeless man, and all because of this damn game SWG.  How can you sleep at
night?
