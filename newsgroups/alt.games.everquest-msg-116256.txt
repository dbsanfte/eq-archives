See, this just goes to prove that if you Americans pronounced it "zed" like
we do you wouldn't have so many complicated choices in life.  :o)

Actually, has anyone got some sort of glossary of all this "l33t" stuff?
Because I have to confess I don't understand any of it.  I don't
particularly WANT to - but it would be nice to understand exactly what
you're all slagging off.  See, in my day it was just idiots who replaced
letters with numbers or symbols but now it seems to be a whole language...
