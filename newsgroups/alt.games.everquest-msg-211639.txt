My experience with the Lupine Dagger is that it procs lightning
fast...usually within the first few hits. I am currently 54 and I start my
fights with the dagger then switch to my Horn of Hsagra.
I think the Defiance is way too heavy. The AC is nice but if you are not
taking the hits then it will not make a difference.
The Jagged Blade is a very nice Secondary. When you get near 50 get a
Defenders Lightblade for your secondary.

Good luck fellow Ranger
