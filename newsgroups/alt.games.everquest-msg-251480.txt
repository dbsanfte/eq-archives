Not binding outside the combat zone

Not doing some kind of damage if mana isn't a problem for heals

Letting people die repeatedly, even though the MT doesnt' seem to be in 
any danger and mana isn't a problem

Letting MT die, again despite there being no apparant problem

After death, running back from a looong ways away, and NOW, with no KEI 
and practically no buffs, using the hammer pet on level 63 mobs.

I try not to armchair quarterback, but I've been a cleric (three of em, 
in fact, one after another, over the years) and a druid and a shaman... 
in my opinion every one of those was a probable cleric error, and adding 
them all together in a single LDoN run, which we ended up failing by one 
mob (slaughter), well, thats a "you get the 'do not play' ignore list"

Splendid One, 63 Gnomage, Firiona Vie

not that I mind losing an LDoN, mind you, and in fact I prefer the ones 
where we go down to the wire, admittedly more when we win, but if you 
never lose then it must not have been really close.  I got 15 times as 
much exp as I did in the same time soloing, I got more cash than I did 
in the same time soloing, I didn't die (although only because I did the 
"wrong" thing and ran from mobs that attacked me, letting the pet pull 
the mobs off me instead of assuming the group would handle things)

Its more a matter of style or... I dunno.  Just bugged me.  Made me want 
to go start a new cleric, or run my 65 one.
