Ok I was in disco1 last night in seb and make an interesting observation.
While in the throws of a Torgor's Insects spell I noticed that while I was
not swinging at my normal rate, my weapon seemed to be proc-ing at it's
normal rate!

The problem was our be-buffer was oom, so I had to stick out the duration of
the spell and noticed my wep proc'd about 3 times (3-4 is about average).

Is this just a coinsedence, or a look into how proc-ing weapons work?
