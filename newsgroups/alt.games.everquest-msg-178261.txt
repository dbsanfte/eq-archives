Hey all,

haven't played in a long while (since before SoL), have been reading up
on things that have changed lately.  I read a post on a forum by
someone who said, "I don't group, I solo and save my money for KEI" or
something. From the context it looked to be some form of buff, but
what's the deal with the "saving my money" part?
