yeah you can charm them. my chanter is 40 and can charm the stuff near the
zone (havnt tried deeper in) however my experience is the charm always
breaks before it kills its target. so a good idea to root whatever its
fighting, and have rune up. your charm should hold slightly longer than mine
since you have a couple levels over me.
