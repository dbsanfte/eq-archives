Travellers boots. Same as JBoots, but the clickable SoW effect has a
recast time whereas JBoots don't. Sell for the same price as the
tinkerer's bag, i.e. a minimum of 5250pp with max faction and charisma.
Put in to kill the AC campfest and JBoot multiquesting racket as far as
I can make out. He couldn't have sold them however since they become
nodrop as soon as you buy them, probably so you have to make it to a
high enough level to actually get to the vendor in Sol A, rather than
just dropping 5250pp on your level 1 twink.
