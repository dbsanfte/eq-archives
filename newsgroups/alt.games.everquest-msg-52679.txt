Yes, but that is not the context in which I used this example.  I am not
talking about entrepreneurship.  My point is, if it is valid for you to
classify me as an idiot for spending money on something you wouldn't spend
money on, then I could just as validly call you an idiot for spending money
on something *I* wouldn't spend money on.

If you want to remove the element of resale value from my argument, then I
could just as legitimately say you were an idiot for spending money to
attend a proffesional american football game, because I detest the sport.

In the end, neither of us have anything material to show for our money, both
of our moneys have been spent doing something to enhance our leisure time,
and we have both spent money on something that the other wouldn't agree was
of any significant value.  So follow the thread and use that example instead
of my photography equipment one if you relate to it better.

Ah.  I did misunderstand.  That is an excellent point, and, I feel, is *the*
reason not to engage in this activity.  Even if you don't agree with a rule,
you must gauge whether or not it is worth the risk of the consequences to
break that rule.  I suppose it is up to the individual to decide wether or
not he wishes to take that risk, but either way this particular decision
does not reflect a person's intellect, and certainly not this decision
alone.

I believe if you follow this thread all the way back to my first response to
Lokari you will see that my entire argument was actually *based* on this
choice of term and the fact that she used this term *without* the courtesy
of putting forth any arguments on the merits of the practice, as you have
done.

The discussion between you and I, I admit, has evolved into a debate of the
merits of the practice, but the basis for this argument was the fact that I
find it narrowminded and ignorant to classify a person as an idiot, gay,
gimp, or any other classification you might care to come up with based
solely on his or her attitude toward buying and selling items obtained in a
video game.

In fact, if you and I *were* to stay focused on this one tight point the
extent of our debate would be "is too", "is not", "is too", "is not" until
one of us simply realized the childishness and futility of such an exchange
and simply quit.

Well, I can certainly accept and respect that.  However, not only do you not
subscribe to this way of thinking, but you condemn those who do.  You are
making the argument that people who read books or play games in
non-conventional manners are "idiots" because *you* do not.  When in fact,
I'd wager that many of these people are "geniouses", though some are
probably "idiots", some "gay" etc.

The point is this is not a valid criteria to classify anybody as anything
except maybe "God-mode video game players" or "Last-chapter first book
readers" LOL.

Me too.  You and I have a lot in common in this regard.

Hmm.  I don't suppose I'm as mystified by it as you are, but I can certainly
see how you would associate these things.

Ah, this is the root of our debate.  This is the very point which brought me
into this thread.  Is it "human" nature meaning humanity as a whole?  Or is
it the nature of only certain humans to "lump all people who do" any
particular thing into a catagory far too broad to be warrented by any one
particular action or trait, then, not only refer to them by derogotory
names, but commit acts of violence against them, isolate them, cast them
out, kill them?

There is certainly a great deal of evidence to support the theory that this
is, in fact, human nature.  However, I feel that there are also certain
humans who either have risen above their nature or offer validty to an
argument countering said theory.  Even if neither is the case, I maintain
that we, as humans, those of us who are enlightened enough to realize and
understand the vulgar aspects of our nature, should feel some sort of
obligation, if not to ourselves then to our species, to rise above our
nature.

I expressed disappointment that Lokari didn't come across, in her post, as
one of these humans.  I don't believe I actually, originally, said anything
for or against the practice at all.

You consistantly refer to an advantage being held by some players over
others.  I don't agree with this view.  Purely within the context of the
game, above and beyond the jealousy or whatever that you may feel, the
possessions and equipment on my character have no impact on yours, or vice
versa, with one exception and that is with regard to the economy, and if
this is your contention then I agree with you on this.  I do believe that
farming items, whether for guilds or eBay or personal gain, adds to
saturation of the economy which is a horrible problem in EQ to begin with.
This problem stems from a design flaw, which is a completely different
debate that I'd rather not get into in this thread, however, regardless of
the root of the economic saturation problem, the farming of items adds to
it, and that is why I believe VI should target and enforce this rule with
regard to eBay sellers.

However, not realizing this flaw doesn't make a potential eBay buyer an
idiot or anything else.  Most people don't put this much thought or analysis
into the economics of video games, and I don't blame them.  I'm just weird
that way.

What about the personality of your character, your tactics in combat, your
ranking within your guild, your name?  Also, a character that I meet wearing
a given piece of equipment has the distinction of wearing that equipment
regardless of where he gets it.  It angers you because he bought it instead
of picking it up off a dead pixel monster?  Perhaps you shouldn't let it
anger you.

> To then gain said equipment through RL means cheapens the equipment.

I agree.  Saturation is a terrible problem in the EQ economy.  Again, this
is a design flaw.  It has to do with the fact that equipment, once it comes
onto the server, never goes away.  Any means of bringing equipment onto the
server further saturates the economy and bringing excessive equipment onto
the server through farming greatly enhances the problem.  This is why most,
if not all, present and future MMORPGs have taken this into account and
allow their items to deteriorate.  I'd really not like to get into a debate
about the logistics of the economy, inflation, etc...  because I am engaged
in a lengthy debate on the subject elsewhere in this newsgroup.  Suffice it
to say that I agree with your point here.

Me?  You can't possibly know what enjoyment a cloak will or will not bring
*me*.  If it brought me my 300 bucks worth, then it was worth 300 bucks.  If
my owning the cloak for 300 bucks lessens your enjoyment of owning the same
cloak, then that is an issue that you must resolve within yourself.

Will I have?  Maybe I would have and maybe not.  I don't know what I would
do, so *you* certainly can't know what I would do.

You can't understand why someone would do it in a way other than the way you
did it, and someone who *does* do it in a way other than the way you did it
is an idiot.

Doesn't this argument seem narrowminded to you?  Perhaps a bit childish?

You should learn that people doing things in ways other than the way you

I disagree and contend that if someone feels that a rule is unjust or unfair
they should challange it, protest it, even break it.  I am not saying that
this is the case with this particular rule.  In fact I rather straddle the
fence on this particular issue, but I don't think people should blindly
follow rules like sheep.

I agree with you, but if you purchase an EQ item from eBay it isn't "given"
to you.  You mentioned paying 300 bucks for a cloak earlier.  That is
earning.  As to the price well, that is set by a very natural system of
supply and demand which tends to dictate a very reasonable price for both
seller and buyer.

By making the claim that you "cannot understand the mentality" of people who
might find enjoyment in a game in ways which you do not, you give me reason
to question your mental processes and prowess.  I do not, of course, find
you unintelligent, obviously, or I wouldn't have spent so much time engaged
in this debate.  However, it does seem rather a simple concept to me, given
the diversity of the human species, that you might immensly enjoy one aspect
of this game while another might enjoy a completely different aspect.
