EQ losing its customer base is no big news, my friend.
Nobody, I mean nobody, that plays EQ can deny that
when WoW opened its doors in late 2004 (I think that's
roughly when it was) there was a hefty mass migration of
players.  The server merges removed any doubt of the
player base shrinkage.

Whatever number the player base needs to get down to
before SOE contemplates ending the spitting out of new
expansions, or shutting down multiple servers, or closing
the game alltogether is anyone's guess.  I know my
server, Bristlebane, still has a thriving community in the
mid to high level game.  The low level, old world zones
are ghost towns, naturally.  A shame to an old timer like me
that goes back to May of 99 - I remember when......

It does still float my boat to keep playing, EQ, thanks for the well
wishes.  But guess what - I play Warcraft, too!  I'm not a complete
Everquest fanboi... I do think WoW is a fun game, too.  It's fun
because it's something different, there's a shit ton of quests to do
and I can actually play solo and jump right in and be doing something
at a moment's notice.

But the above also describes why I still spend most of my time in
EQ.  I just don't see WoW as being all that deep of a game.  It's
*too* easy.  It's a videogame.  It's a MMORPG for the Playstation
generation.  It's no wonder that it has a 5 million user base (and nearly
half of those from China alone, if I'm to believe a story recently done
in either Computer Gaming World or PC Gamer.)

Go and have fun in WoW, if that's what floats your boat <grin>.
It's fun for awhile.....when you're not waiting in line for 15 minutes
to just get into the damn game.  Being the most popular kid in
school does have a few drawbacks, apparently.
