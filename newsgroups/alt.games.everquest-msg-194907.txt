Not sure if you have your heart set on this particular artist, but someone
I'd _highly_ recommend is Evan Smith of Restless Vision Graphics
(www.restlessvision.com).  He doesn't accept in-game plat though (probably
for good reason, though, since Sony scowls at in-game plat for these sorts
of things, but has given their blessing to folks like Evan). And his
waiting list is pretty long, but I suppose that is a good sign of how much
folks love him.  I suppose a lot has to do with whether you like his
style, though.

Ahem, yes, that was a shameless plug for Evan...he's a nice guy who
deserves plugs, imho.  I'll probably do another plug with my picture is
ready (though partly just to show off Foxeye's pretty face).
