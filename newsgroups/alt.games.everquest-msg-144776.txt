Two things to add.  One, Mexico is a nation very rich in resources.  That's
not widely know, but they have minerals out the wazoo (yes, that is a
technical term ^_^  ).  They have no business being impoverished.  So, it
seems that all the resources in the world won't do a bit of good if there's
no one who will put them to use.

Second, slaves were in use in many parts of the world during the time period
in which America owned slaves.  Since it was a constant "advantage," it can
be factored out.  Slavery is still practiced in parts of Africa.  Not that
they've benefited from it (and where the hell are Jessie Jackson and Kweisi
Mfume when it comes to modern-day African slavery??????)
