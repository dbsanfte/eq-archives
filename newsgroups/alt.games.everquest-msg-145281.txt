Yeah but see... *Everquest*.  I try and stick to one addiction at a

Well, no, but I do insist on having my own skewed view on how the world 
should be run.  Now hush, or I'll have you dismembered.  Or at least 
severely ribbon-whipped.

I will NOT face it.  For the reason stated above :D  Besides, if they 
DID make it more fashion-centered, it'd open up to more buyers.  13 year 
old girls!  They could cut a deal with Barbie!  Barbie's new line of EQ 
dolls!  Dress Barbie up just like your DE necromancer!  Ikky Barbie!  
Barbie Barbie!  Kitty Barbie for the furry perv--*ahem* fans!
