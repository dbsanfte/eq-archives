Drops that dramatic *rarely* happen out of the blue.  It's more like 2400 down
to 2000, which usually *is* a major backbone or ISP going down somewhere that
is completely, 100% out of Verant's control.

I'm sure they're sick of people not understanding how the internet works, so
this could be good for them.  (Could make it worse, too, as it will be hard to
tell how many just dropped, and if someone sees 10 other people complaining,
they'll assume EVERYONE must have dropped, and therefor Verant sux0rs and is
lying that it wasn't their fault, etc...)
