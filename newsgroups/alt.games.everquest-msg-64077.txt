  I really wonder if this would have been a problem if we had been allowed
to download the patch while the servers were down (as traditionally has been
the case, with the old patcher).  I wonder if this a deficiency of the new
patcher, or if they were just late in allowing us to download them, or if
they weren't allowing us to download them because they were still tweaking
the new engine even as their ETA came and went.
