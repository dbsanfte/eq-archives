I don't think it's much of a conspiracy theory, it's the way they've
always done expansions. The Kunark indoor evacs, the fangs in Velious
to get access to the other port circles, added ports in Luclin. 

I'm just surprised it took em this long, too many good players I know
have walked away from EQ because of flagging issues. Strangely enough,
the ones that ran to 65, got flags, then found out they couldn't do
anything worthwhile with their friends because the rest of us weren't
flagged. 

With this change, it just means that when I get a group of friends up
we'll no longer be tied to the least common denominator for flagged
hunting zones. 

It's also gonna be fun to listen to all the idiots whining about this
change. <g>

Rgds, Frank
