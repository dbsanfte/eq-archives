I was healer for a Veksar group with a L50 Druid, with no mana regen
except for a Clarity that faded soon after we set up (we were after,
and got, the ac38 greaves for a guildmate).  This was a group on
Stromm, levels ranged from 50 to 57, no outside buffs (aside from the
aforementioned Clarity), one of the tanks was a Paladin who added a
little bit of healing (not much, she didn't get to sit down often).
CC was via Necro mez, and two near wipes were averted by his timely
twitching of my Druid.  What's all that mean?  It means that Druids
can heal.  They can't heal like Clerics:  they won't keep your stupid
ass alive while the Enchanter tries to lock down that 6 mob overpull.
But if your group is competent a Druid can keep it alive.  If I can
keep a group fighting in Veksar with no mana regen, then a Druid with
KEI and a slower in the group can do ok in LDoN, and has in two of
the groups I've been in (mid-50s, no incomplete heal).
