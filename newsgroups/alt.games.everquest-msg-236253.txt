Hey there :) I play Sebu, 56 Cleric of Drinal. Welcome to AGE.

I have done a lot of research for which way I will go when the time comes.
My first list looks like:

Tier 1: Run3 and either regen or metabolism
Tier 2: Mental Clarity and Spell Casting Reinforcement
Tier 3: Spell Casting Reinforcement mastery, MGB, bestow DA, and Divine 
Resurrection

If I ever get past all of that I will learn some more.

It's a crowd pleaser and good for raids I would imagine, but I think that 
mana regen and extended buffs will help the most in day-to-day life. MGB 
does not help you level/exp, mana regen and decreased mana expenditure do.
