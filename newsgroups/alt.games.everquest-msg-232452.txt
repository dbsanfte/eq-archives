Hi All;

I'm working with an chanty friend of mine on his epic.  While lurking in a
couple of chanty forums to learn some of it, someone suggested going to
Neriak 3rd Gate, to the cleric guild and buy some porting stones for the
Plane of Hate. The poster said to keep some on you and in the bank for when
you die. Then just get a wizzy to port us there.  Then if we die we can use
the porting stones to get back up there without a wizzy. I've searched
around but can't find anything about porting stones.

Are these real?
If so, exactly how do they work and how much do they cost ??

Thanks in advance for you help and time.
