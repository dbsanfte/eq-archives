AE mez can only affect 5 mobs at a time. At PB range, the first check
is against the enchanter, so that leaves four mobs. It's stuns all the
way. The PB stuns can hit 50+ mobs, though I'd hate to try it alone.

Wow. The AE groups I've been in (not many) have never tried anywhere
near that many mobs. The only time I ever tried 25+ mob we got waxed,
just too many resists and both enchanters got stunned. Maybe that was
just bad luck, but we usually did about 10 mobs. I'd like to give that
a shot some time.

Mabe we're just doing something wrong.
