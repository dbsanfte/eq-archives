What he said.  If someone's leaving the game and wants to make money off
their stuff, I don't have a problem with it.

What I have a problem with is the professional item/plat farmers who are
doing it strictly to sell, and in many cases denying people in-game the
opportunity to obtain the item for themselves.

The economic effects are a bit more subtle, but just as insidious, since
items don't decay, and in general money just flows back and forth between
players.  Items become less and less valuable, and as more plat enters the
economy, the plat becomes less and less valuable too.
