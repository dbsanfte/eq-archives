Quote from Patch Message

"** Grouping **

We have revamped the grouping system.  This is a major rewrite of the system
that should have little effect on gameplay, with the exception of removing
the bugs with the old system.  Players should no longer have issues with
their group due to the link-death of any member (including the leader),
zoning and other such issues.  There is also a new command available."

Hmmm major rewrite...that normally means a good couple of emergency patches
due.
