I wish I had asked for help last night. I was passing through Lake
Rathe, noticed the Tainted was up, and figured I've got KEI, I can
handle this.

Burned the tainted to the ground, and was still at 80% mana. The
corrupted spawned, I hit him fast and hard, and... he ate me for
lunch. I never had a chance.

I don't mind the dying, but I really HATE losing the KEI!
