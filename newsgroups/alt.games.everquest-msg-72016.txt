I've said it in another thread too. I think there should be non combat bases
pratice facilities for combat skills. It's silly to learn how to safe fall
by jumping of a building. It would be better to have a pratice area with a
net.
As a ranger however, I really think our class is pretty well balanced out
and all, but becoming any good with your main defining weapon , the bow, is
just to big a hassle. Add to that that no other class has to pay for skill
ups, as rangers need to fletch arrows or buy them.
So I think a shooting range in every city with a ranger guild is in order so
archers can practice their skill before taking on a sabertooth cat and
losing.
And a summon arrows spell line is warranted too. One at lvl 9 with crappy
arrows, but good enough then. One at lvl 22 with rather nice arrows, but
nothing fancy. One at lvl 39 with long range magic arrows and maybe one
later on with a special kind of one off mega hyper super all or nothing
arrow.
