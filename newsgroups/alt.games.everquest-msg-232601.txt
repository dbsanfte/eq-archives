That is correct.

nope

Yep. Even had the much smarter wife come over and show me that one when 
I *did* screw up and have the height filter on. But I've mastered that 
bit now.

> Have you zoomed out on the maps?

Yepper. All the way out. Some zone where she has a complete map, I at 
least have some of the zone walls and zone-outs. (e.g. Tennebrous and 
Grimling Forrest for some odd reason) But somehow I dont' have as much 
stuff filled in as her in many of these zones, and in most of the 
others, mine are totally blank except for right where I'm standing.

Very odd. I'm considering deleting all the files in the map folder and 
trying again.
