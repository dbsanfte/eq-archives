I said your point was wrong.  You are the one who started throwing putdowns
and swearing at me.

Which point exactly was i wrong about?  That Sk's can be MA effectively in
one of the highest dungeons in the game (Sebilis)..  You tell me im talking
shit, but you've never even done the king camp, so I wonder how you can be
so sure im wrong, when you haven't even been there.

YOU missunderstood my comments about agro when i was speaking about my monk,
thinking I was refering to my SK, so after your mistake, and then your rants
at why I was wrong, you dont admit your mistake or agree you got it wrong
about which char was being refered to, you just forget it happened and pick
something else to flame me on

What was I wrong about with SK taunt?  I have stated  from the beginning my
SK doesn't group hardly ever(I said its been powerleveled somewhat), and has
never grouped with a warrior.. what I have seen on my other chars every day
for months, is different classes acting as the MA, and how well they
perform.
