Does anyone have any good screen shots they'd like to share?

Here are a few of mine, anyway

This was a train returning from chasing a 52nd Paladin to zone in Runnyeye.
The Moldmaster went off else where but the 2 slayspells and 2 seekers all
came back together and said "Hi". Check my health.

Hmmm with this sort of success with a bow, maybe I should be a ranger

Saw this once in Kithicor, anyone else ever seen the tiger there or anywhere
else?
