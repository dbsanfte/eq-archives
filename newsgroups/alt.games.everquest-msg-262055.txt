If you raid, MGB is darned useful.  Even if there are other folks with it,
yours makes recovery after a wipe easier.  And you make people smile when you
MGB clarity in PoK just before camping (it'll reset when you're offline, so no
reason not to).

Nothing in PoP can be DCed and add significant kill rate.  Most of the DC are
trash put there specifically for DC, and do just a hair more than mage pets.
This is gonna become even more clear with new pet spells in OoW.  

DC is handy for farming old zones, and as a nice toy in some groups.  It's not
useless, but it's not game-changing.  If you haven't already, you'll be far
better off getting eldrich rune, doppleganger 1, the pet control AA (less
damage than DC, but you'll use it FAR more often), or defensive AAs.

Dire Charm won't significantly increase your xp rate.  It's simply not that
powerful after level 60 and after the xp changes to make mobs worth less xp
if they're not within 5 levels of you.  It was insane back when Sebilis
was good xp.  Now it's just kinda nice sometimes.

If you're expecting to spend a lot of time before getting to level 67+, then
Mez Mastery is worth saving for, over MGB or DC.  Adding a tick to Word of
Morell is very very good.  If you're getting into non-dire charming (and
expect to go slowly above level 66, as charm is currently non-viable in
OoW), Total Domination is worth some points.  This _CAN_ speed up getting new
AAs, but expect to die a lot while getting the hang of it.
