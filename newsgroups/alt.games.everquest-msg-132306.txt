That is what the execs say NOW...

That is NOT what they said BEFORE all this started..  Check the
Washington Post article where this was first reported..

So, you feel that 2 yr olds need to be educated about aids???

If you are, isn't it YOUR job to educate your child when they are that
age??  Or do you abdicate that right and responsibility to your TV??
