Please don't dump on me for playing solo!

 I have a lvl 26 half elf ranger in WK.  I have only played solo so
far.  I like places like BB and HHP where there is a spawn point by the
zone so I can run for it.  Is there a zone somewhere where a solo ranger
can keep playing at the 26 to 35 lvl?
 I don't this game isn't for solo play.
 I don't need to have grouping pushed on me.
 Thank you for any help in playing solo!
