Some caution is definately advised with the Griffs of various flavors. But my
16 BL  soloed Blue, white and yellow Griffawns with no problem. Funny thing
though. After you do a few, you suddenly seems to get some Griff adds.

In NK you can bind at the Gypsy camp thereby saving  the inconvenience of a
long CR from Queynos, or that wait if bound at the Nexus. I don't think  PoP
portal are an option for the Karanas.
