This is not good news.  Watch now, a combination of VI's incompetence
and the arrogance of a handful of assholes is gonna get Wizards nerfed
so bad the old whines won't begin to describe how fucked your class is.

Jazz switched to Wizard some months ago.  I'd guess that 3 Manaburns
(burn, minute 1, burn, minute 2, burn) plus 3 wizards nuking for all
they're worth has a pretty good shot at taking down the same Kunark
dragons that they were killing with 4 to 6 before the nerf.
