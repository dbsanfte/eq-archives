Now I'll grant ye, some a' me kin go a bit beyond the pale, but that's no 
reason to taint alla the Wolves o' the North with the same brush...

And the fellow in Vladesch's example shouldn't be allowed in the Wolves... 
He ran away from a fight for fear of his own life, leaving his groupmate 
at risk!  His dishonor shall ne'er fade.
