The vast majority of people who have served in the US armed forces
have seen no combat. My older brother spent four enlistments in the
Navy (submariner sonar tech) and not a single combat zone. My younger
brother is on his second Naval enlistment (currently serving as
maintenance tech on an aircraft carrier) and has yet to see combat. My
step sister served two enlistments in the Marines (communications
expert) and saw no combat, and she remains married to a Marine who, in
his third enlistment, has yet to visit a combat zone (although he and
his unit were relocated to Germany for a time as reserves in the
Kosovo 'intervention'.) Out of a very proud tradition of national
service in my family, only one person has seen combat: My grandfather,
submariner Lt. Paul Warrington of the USS Leatherback, during World
War II.

Try barking up a different tree.
