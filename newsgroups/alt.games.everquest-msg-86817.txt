Actually, I was considering order of operation, according to which
shouldn't the parenthetical be evaluated BEFORE considering mult/div?

Therefore, wouldn't step one of the extrapolation of your example
yield (Level * 2) + (Level * Wisdom) / (Level * 5)?

Plug in a Level of 10 and a wisdom of 200:
Your original alternative: (10*2) + (10*200) / (10*5) or 20+2000/50 or
60
The EQ formula you gave initially: 10*2+10*200/5 or 20+400 or 420

If I am correctly evaluating the parenthetical expression first, then
it appears the two are in fact different.

Am I in error here? This is kind of interesting in a slide-ruly
supergeek kinda way.  :)
