I stand corrected; I don't actually have a problem with the alternate
skills horse in any event, however it's gained.

I wasn't expecting the "uber horse of bard speed" for free; I was,
based on magazine interviews with game developers, expecting "a
summoned horse" of some type. I fully understand that things change
between the lead time of a magazine interview and the release of the
actual expansion; however, I didn't see any sort of "Um, nevermind, no
free horses". Thus, my question.

I don't think "no free horses" is unfair in any way, actually. I was
just tired of looking endlessly for a spell that apparently isn't in
the game.
