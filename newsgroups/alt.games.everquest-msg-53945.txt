I'd start with any race but human, barbarian, or erudite.  Why?  Because
the game system is designed around constant round the clock activity,
in a world that runs much faster than ours (figured it out once, forget
what the ratio is, but say one EQ day is one real world hour.)  These
three races lack any form of night vision, and once you get out in the
world a little you'll find that you really really can't see in some places
at night.  There are ways around this, but at low levels, when you are
first learning the game, its simply no fun to be blind half the time.  Worst
are human rangers and druids, who's training zone is almost impossible
to get in and out of without night vision.

I'd pick any class but bard.  Bards are great, but they are a lot of
work to play well, and not knowing how things work isn't going to
make that any easier.  Others may disagree, but its the one class I'd
advise not starting with.  If you are dead set on doing it anyway,
heck, might be great, as you'd have no idea how much easier the
other classes are!

You might start with a hybrid class; paladin, shadowknight, ranger;
these classes don't get spells until 9th level, so you are pretty much
a warrior with a trick up his sleeve until then, yet will be able to stick
with your character further and pick up the nuances of casting spells
as well, once you've got the tanking thing down to some extent.
