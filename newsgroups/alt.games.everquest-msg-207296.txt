From the shadows, the mysterious LANkrypt0 <admin@lankrypt0.com> (if

Nothing. They just want more people on test and there's very little
they can still learn from the L1-24 game.

Some classes get quite nice stuff. Shadowknights get the equivalent of
MOSS, and warriors can dual wield Centi LS equivalents, with a small
trick (otherwise one LS and one SS). Both seem to get decent AC/sta
gear too for a fair amount of AC and hitpoints.

That's not a bad guess actually. It changes according to the level.
Both clerics and shamans seem to be in severe demand at the upper
levels; rogues too. However there's a fairly large warrior population
and surprisingly not all that many high level necros. Definately
wizards would be no where near the top. And since Test has been
kicking around since long before Luclin and people are still playing
mains from before then, Beastlords at high level aren't all that
common either.
