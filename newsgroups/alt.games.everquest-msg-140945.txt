Scott from VI came and dropped in to post on Graffe's about this issue.
(Why is a mystery, since we're probably the only fucking class with no
dots at all. LOL.) But anyway, it's going live on Test now, but he very
specifically said this was in *TEST* (emphasized) mode, and was going to
be looked over a good bit before any version of this went live.

However, the intent, if it's managed, is as the OP asked. 

Yes, this change would allow Necro_01 and Necro_02 to both cast the SAME
dot on the mob and both affect it normally.  

Yes, they are putting in all safeguards possible to prevent any exploit
where somebody can zone, LD, FD, whatever and be able to cast their own
same dot twice. 

No, mobs that cast dots will *not* receive this benefit and be able to
stack identical dots on players. 

No, this benefit will not go to PvP combat... only Player vs. NPC. 

Yes, VI is aware of the fifteen buff slot limit on mobs and the issues
that this could cause, and yes they are already implementing (on the
test version) measures to alleviate this by allowing more debuff/dot
slots on the mob for raid issues.

Sounds pretty cool to me. And for the guy who was asking in another
thread about groups of multiple Necros, this will make such a team even
*more* devastating, as dot conflict issues were the only things holding
them back from stacking perfectly.
