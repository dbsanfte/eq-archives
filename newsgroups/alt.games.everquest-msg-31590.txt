Bingo.  You can exploit all day, and night, provided you do not directly
or indirectly gain xp by doing so.  Ping ponging Scarabs over the line
in Nro to nuke them without getting hit.  an exploit gets you a
warning/banning.  Running past that line on your way to the zone,
knowing that they will bounce off it.  Wise agro management.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
