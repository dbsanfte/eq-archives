By the looks of it, you're doing everything by the book.
Just as a suggestion and perhaps you are doing it already,
make sure you change your view so that you not only see
yourself but the area around you so that in case you see
any possible add you can avoid them.

I'd snare my mobs then strafe (sp?) left and right and move away till
all mobs are almost looking like one. Once I got them tight, I'd change my
view
to avoid adds then start to light them up. That was my method.
I know a few like to circle around  till the group is tight. I liked to try
something
different. Once in awhile you'll get a minor resist from one or two of them.
So in case you start to run outta mana, you can move further back and sit
till they
got close enough, rinse and repeat, till you had enough to finish them off.

At lvl 35 I moved on to Dire wolves using the above method and it worked
well for me. If I did run into trouble Id just ran across the bridge and
zoned
to EW.

Lightning strike is just a AOE, not with a DOT.

If I were you I'd just stick around here for a few lvl's forget the OT
thing.

Well thats my 2cents  =)
