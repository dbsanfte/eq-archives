When you say this you are ignoring half of Annie's experience; she says 
"original beta" yes, and thats what you are reacting to, but note she 
also says "test server".

Test server has every zone that EQ Live does, and a the kind of very low 
population numbers that you guys are talking about.

And she's admitting that below that 300-400 range that it is indeed a 
ghost town.

Of course you do have to take into account that she quit before OOW, I 
think before GOD, and her time on Test was even earlier than that, so 
maybe she didn't even have LDoN/LOY?  She'll have to give you that 
detail, anyway point being the world was a bit smaller, so maybe her 
300-400 figure is a bit low after all... or maybe not, because as far as 
I've seen even on regular population servers, when new zones were added, 
people didn't so much spread into them, as abandon old zones in favor of 
new(cough LDoN cough, cough OOW cough), or ignore new in favor of old 
(cough LOY cough, cough GOD cough)
