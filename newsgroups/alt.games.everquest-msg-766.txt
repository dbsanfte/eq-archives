Thanks, but I'm still trying to determine if I have to make it all the way to
"kindly" in order to do this quest, or if there's some intermediate point
where I will be trusted again?  From the looks of the consideration chart
posted here, I may well have to literally kill a thousand gnolls to make it to
"kindly". (unless you get more faction for a gnoll guard, let's say, than a
gnoll pup. Anyone know that?)
   The main reason that is such an issue for me is that there are several
higher level quests which I would eventually like to undertake for my monk
which I simply cannot do without the series of headbands.  Now, having gotten
to "amiable" and being able to train whenever I wish, I don't plan to give
up.  If I have to find Blackburrow groups to join and just sit there and kill
gnolls for a month, so be it.  But I'm just curious as to how far I'll have to
go with this to get the needed faction. There are other places/quests I'd like
to be away to.
