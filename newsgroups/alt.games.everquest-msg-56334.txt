The best thing I can recommend is to set up your hotkey banks.  Learn
them and use them.  I never use the mouse to start and stop songs, and
it's not that hard on the hands to press 1-wait-2-2-wait-3-3-wait-1-1
etc.  I've got 9 of the 10 posssible hotkey banks set up, and I'll set
them up in different orders so that I can do different song twists
without having to stretch my hands into odd positions.
I've heard that some folks use programmable joysticks, but I tried
using macros in combat and found it just too aggrevating to miss a
cycle because I couldn't recover from a missed note.  Really, if you
get the hotkeys set up correctly (including all your %t is mezzed, %t
is my pet-kill something else, %t is beating on the bard-get it off,
/assist <maintank> etc), and learn them, you'll find that you only
have to hit a key to start combat, and only have to cycle through your
songs. 
Another thing you can do is to make socials for every song.  Instead
of just dragging the song gem to the hotkey slot, make the following
social, and put that there:

/pause 3, /stopsong
/cast X (where X is song number)

This stops the current song, waits 3/10s of a second, then starts the
selected song.  You don't have to do the stop-start manually now.

Make one of these for each song slot, and you can then press
1-wait-2-wait-3-wait-1-wait rather than 1-wait-2-2-wait-3-3-wait-1.
Some bards swear by it, I'm too lazy.
