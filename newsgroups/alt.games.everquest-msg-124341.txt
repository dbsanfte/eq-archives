In all fairness, my monk was my first character that I played past level
3. (About four days or so into the game.) I was into my teens before a
kind stranger pointed out that I had to put a training point into the
skills I didn't get at birth before I could use them or raise them. And
I tend to read up on the games I play a *lot* and research the shit out
of stuff.

Yes, hard to believe, but I guess it's possible to make it into your
thirties on your first character and not pay any attention to your stats
and what they mean.
