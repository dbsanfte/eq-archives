But the problem is that its implementation was a joke since all of the
items which are that way in warrens are also no drop and lore. The no
drop takes care of the "farming" anyway making the trivial code moot.

Besides that the items mostly suck ass. THAT is the basic best item
design as far as the warrens and stonebrunt go, NOT the trivial code.
When an item SUCKS no one bothers to farm it except people of the
appropriate level ANYWAY. So if you make items that fit the area they
are in and the area is for lower players than you have no problem.
