EQ won't run adequately on such a system. The amount of video memory is only
one factor in video performance. I've recently built three systems based
upon the ECS P6STM motherboard. This motherboard has built in LAN, sound and
video. Up to 64MB video can be allocated from system memory. The allocation
is done in the BIOS. One of these systems, with a total of 1GB PC133 sdram
(2x512MB) was installed about two weeks ago, at that time utilized as the
primary system for an Everquest/Luclin gamer who runs it around 10-12 hours
per day, every day. I am NOT a gamer and am not familiar with Luclin, but
the user tells me that video response is sluggish, even without all options
turned on (whatever that means). Sixty four MB system memory is allocated to
video, with the remaining 960MB available for system use. I personally
observed the situation and found that sluggish performance is evident when a
bunch of characters appear on the screen at the same time and you move
around the screen. In contrast, when focus is changed so that just one
character appears on the screen, performance is smooth.

[Internet access is via a 384k SDSL connection, 10/100 LAN with 3COM
Superstack 24 port hub. All systems run Windows XP Professional]

As a result of inadequate system response, I built another computer to use
as the primary Luclin system. (The P6STM system is now utilized as the
secondary Luclin system, as well as for email, etc.) This one is based upon
the ECS K7S5A motherboard, with Athlon XP1700+ and 1GB (2x512) PC2100 DDR
sdram  The K7S5A mother has onboard LAN and sound, but no onboard video. We
installed a Visiontek Gforce3TI200 video card. The user informs me that this
system runs smoothly with all options turned on. I watched a group of
characters kill a dragon last night and system/video performance looked to
be excellent. Although I am willing to install a Gforce3TI500 video card, at
an increase in price of about $150, it does not appear to be necessary.

Bottom line, the key to video performance is the video processor, NOT just
the amount of video memory. Motherboards that allocate
system memory to video typically can supply ample quantities of video, but
their video processing is greatly inferior to a quality standalone video
card.

Hope this helps.
