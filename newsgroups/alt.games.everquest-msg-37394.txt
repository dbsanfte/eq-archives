Please, please, please NO NO NO.

If I wanted to sit in a Karnor's north wall camp for 60 levels, I would
play AO, where I would have the prospect of another 140 levels of the
same thing to look forward to. 

I am not saying such places shouldn't exist, though I think they should
probably have a lower exp modifier than they do. I am saying that the
part of the game I like is taking a 6 person group crawling through ToFS
or Kaesora. You can't do it every week night, but then I don't play
every single week night.

Half the problem with the game is that people play it for so long (16
hours at a stretch is not uncommon, I had someone in a pickup group once
claim that they had been playing 44 hours straight) they are literally
too tired to do anything other than the simplest gimp pull single blue
mob, kill, leave loot to rot cos it had none, repeat x 400 group that is
all too common these days.
