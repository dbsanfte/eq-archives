So, again... really none of my business as it's your guild, but you've
got my curiousity up here....... do you have that spelled out in your
guild's charter, guidelines, or whatever you use to educate your
applicants? I mean, does it *specifically* say "Guild clerics in guild
xp groups will get first dibs on trash gems that drop <up to, but not to
exceed, the cost of the reagents they use buffing the group>"? Or is it
a more informal, "we roll on the big stuff and give the trash gems to
the cleric" sort of deal like we have? The reason I ask is, if I were
that cleric and I was informed of that policy, (the latter example, not
the former, wherin you'd be totally justified IMHO, to boot them right
now) and happily collected a bunch of gems on a camp, and then found out
that keeping the gems was one of the reasons I'd been rejected for
membership, I think I'd be pretty pissed off and think the guild
leadership was pretty fucked up, and probably tell anybody else that
story too so they'd think so also before they thought of joining.

As to the first reason, I completely agree that interguild
communications, particularly in a raiding guild, are vital. And member
should be *required* to keep up on the news, schedules, etc. But if this
brand new applicant hasn't checked the boards yet, I sure hope either
his sponsor or one of the officers has at least taken the time to say,
"I see you haven't visited the guild web site. Did you know about it, or
are you having trouble connecting to it, getting a password, etc.?"
before they just uncerimoniously get the boot.
