    Not everyone feels the same way you do. In my guild there's a lot of
talk of partners, and also some pretty raunchy stuff. A person would feel
like an outsider if they couldn't take part.

    It's fairly long, and you need to read a while to get to the part that
really drives the point home (last two pages). Nindail is in my guild. So is
Marklar. If Nindail weren't the total extrovert that he is, I could see him
feeling the need to "hide his preference". Look at some of the other
responses in that thread - it's borderline hate.

    EQ has a lot of teenaged players. Many of them are quite tolerant, more
so than their elders, but the ones that aren't are usually much more vocal
in their hatred. And in my experiences, people that will stick up for the
minority are few and far between if they aren't personal friends with the
person being picked on.

    I imagine most gays in EQ stick to a "don't ask, don't tell" policy and
just don't talk about their life outside EQ. Which is sad, as one of the
best parts of the game is the friendships you make in it.
