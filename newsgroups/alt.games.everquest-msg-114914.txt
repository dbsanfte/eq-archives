Nope never.  He's classed as a twink at level 54 (shh, don't tell anybody he
was my first character), so he's not even guild tagged (he has a tag of some
r/l friends small guild anyway)

The first time we killed Tunare, I was talking to a guild friend (60 mage)
asking if he had died, what he had landed etc... he said he chain casted
malise(not sure of the exact 59/60 magician version) through the entire
fight, and it didn't land once.

It was tashed, Im not sure if a shaman malo'd it (tho id assume so)..  I'd
have felt so useless though if I were him, I wouldn't even enjoy raiding i
don't think
