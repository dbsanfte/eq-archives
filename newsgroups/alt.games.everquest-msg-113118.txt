1.  Work on earning any of the dozens of "alternate
advancement" abilities which were added with the
Luclin expansion.

2.  Go after the really *big* mobs.  Someone once
said that "EQ life doesn't begin until you ding 60",
and there's a lot of truth in that.  Some raids can
only be reasonably survivable if you're 60, or at
least 58/59+.

3.  Work on a good collection of the really high-end
gear, the stuff that only drops from the mobs mentioned
in #2.

4.  Get ready for the Planes of Power expansion to
come out.  Verant is making some heavy hints that
there will be new paths of character advancement in
PoP.
