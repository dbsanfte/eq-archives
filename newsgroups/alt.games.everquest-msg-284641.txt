Actually I tend to do just about everything on the keyboard that I can
and I prefer lots of hotbars.  Switching between pages takes more time
than assigning key combos to each hotbutton currently visible, IMO.

For example, on my Ranger it's something like:
Hotbar one: attack buttons, regular innate camo (AA ability), a few
inventory slots, AA snare
Hotbar two: Bandolier buttons, group innate camo, a few combat
abilities, tracking
Hotbar three: a few other AA abilities, group find player (LAA ability)
and I think a few other LAA abilities?
Hotbar three, page two: Other veteran AAs and LAAs

I guess I don't actually use the keyboard on hotbar three though...
