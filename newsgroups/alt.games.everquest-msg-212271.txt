I understand there are a couple of folks you speak to as part of a group in
PoJ, that get your group flagged for Plane of Storms, and some other Plane.

What are the details?  Who do you speak to, what flags are obtained? Where
are the guys (LOCs or a map?) How hard / how big a group to get there?

Only been to PoJ a couple of quick times and fought in immediate hallways
against Sentries. I'm a 54 Druid.

Thanks.
