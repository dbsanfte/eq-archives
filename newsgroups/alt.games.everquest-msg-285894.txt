The Silk Road Project Announces 2007 Schedule
The Silk Road Project, connecting artists and audiences around the
world under the artistic direction of cellist Yo-Yo Ma, announced
today that it will launch a global journey in 2007 with Silk Road
Ensemble concerts, residencies, workshops and museum events in Santa
Barbara, Berkeley, Seattle, Chicago, Providence, Cambridge, Lucerne,
Zurich and China.
Ford Motor Company Fund is Global Corporate Partner to the Silk Road
Project, as part of its long-standing tradition of arts education
support.
The musicians of the Silk Road Ensemble -- an eclectic, loosely knit
band of virtuosos, rooted in the traditions of more than eight nations
-- will perform more than 25 concerts with programs of new
compositions and traditional music, as well as 4 multimedia
performances. The Silk Road Project's year ahead also features
collaborations with the Art Institute of Chicago and the Rietberg
Museum in Zurich, as well as residencies with Harvard and the Rhode
Island School of Design (RISD). An unprecedented year-long Silk Road
celebration in Chicago continues with a wide range of events,
including concerts with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in April, and a
major concert for schoolchildren at Millennium Park in June.
"We established the Silk Road Project to study the ebb and flow of
ideas among different cultures along the ancient Silk Road," Yo-Yo Ma
stated. "This year, through our concerts, residencies and commissions,
we re-trace old paths of exchange and explore some of today's most
exciting musical crossroads from the United States to Europe to
Asia."
"Given the contemporary global environment, the ideas that inspire the
Silk Road Project are even more compelling today than they were at our
inception in 1998," commented Laura Freid, CEO and Executive
Director.
