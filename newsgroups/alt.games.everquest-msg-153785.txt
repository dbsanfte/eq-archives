I found all 6 Cowboy Bebop DVDs at the local used CD/DVD/PS2 store for 14
bucks apiece.  Somebody had just brought them in the day before, along with
a lot of other anime I know nothing about (I think I mentioned in the
original post that I've never really been in to anime).

I think I popped the balloon of the guy behind the counter at the store ...
he was hoping to get the Cowboy Bebop series for himself. :-)

The other things were (excuse me if I get the names a bit confused):

- Akira (it was in a metal box) for $19
- Two 3-DVD box sets of Robotech for $22 apiece
- And another series (started with Tech ...) with about 4 DVDs for $14.

No 'Blue Submarine #6' though .. I think I would've remembered that title
even though I hadn't seen the preview at the time.

Any of those series worth watching? :-)

Thanks,
Crash
