Well, I fit the first two statements, but I think you're the one being a bit 
dense here.  Verant has said it will take the same amount of EXP to make 50, NOT 
that it would take the same amount of effort or the same amount of kills.  If 
they just multiply all exp in hell levels by 1.9 or so (so a kill that would be 
100,000 EXP is now 190,000 EXP) it would still require the same amount of raw 
EXP, but almost 4 levels LESS work.  
Why would we think Verant would make hell levels easier, but not make the other 
levels harder to compensate?  Well, we have Verant's past history to go on, we 
have the fact that they have NOT given any real information about how they're 
going to implement this, AND we have the fact that in every statement they only 
claim that it takes just as much experience, not just as much time or just as 
many kills.

> Whining / stupidity, there's something at work thereï¿½

Well, the rest of us seem to understand that it would be very, very easy to fix 
the hell levels without compensating in the other levels.
