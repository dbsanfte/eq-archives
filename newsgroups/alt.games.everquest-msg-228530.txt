    Or like the Lanys event quest, where multiple parts were broken at
different times so the quest was never completed before being removed from
game.

    Some are just obscure to the point that you don't want to follow up on
them. Take the Lewena quest in Shadow Haven. Woman at a bar says that she'll
tell you a secret if you give her her favourite drink. Ok, fine. Players
have handed in every known drink in the game to her, nothing. So it's got to
be a new drink, either quested or tradeskill-created. Someone who helped
make many of the recipes for the game then gives the hint that it's a
tradeskill-created drink. Well, even though there are a few NPCs in town
that look like they might know the recipe, none of them are spilling it. So
players start combining everything in creation with a tradeskill tag, helped
by such clues as what Lewena's name is an anagram of (new ale). Nothing.
Even with the drink's creator giving hints as to what the ingredients are,
nobody could come up with the recipe as you just don't know how many of each
ingredient are involved.

    So, as a player, would you attempt to complete this quest? No
information in game on what this wench wants, you could hand her drinks that
are known until the cows come home and nothing, you have no idea if a NPC is
broken or if the recipe is broken (was later confirmed working by the
tradeskill guy), there's no in-game clues as to what the drink is. Assuming
you do stumble on the recipe and give her the drink, since the quest is as
simple as "brew X, hand it in" you KNOW the reward won't be better than a
few coins and faction. So why even waste time on it?
