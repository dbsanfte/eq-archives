Uh, excuse me, but I'll have a hissy fit now, thank you very much.
Just because others have lost more money (*far* more from the sound of
it, and they have my sincere sympathy) on failed combines, doesn't
mean I should be less frustrated with the system that causes it.

Hop down off the high horse long enough to simply consider that things
really are tough all over, not just for the "733t" tradesfolk. You
make it sound like I must become a grand master or suffer huge losses
before I have a right to complain. No, I can voice all the complaints
this flawed system fosters, and justifiably so, without being a member
of some elitist "I Lost X,XXXpp on a Failed Combine and I'm Mad as
Hell about It" club.

Btw, my gripe was about the fact that I disagree with their formula
for determining success on combines, not the degree of monetary loss.
That would be a seperate issue on which I would have far less personal
experience, since even my 184 smith has not seen a loss of more than a
hundred-ish pp on one combine yet.

Rumble <--- also sympathizes with the pottery GM - that had to suck
