I experienced the same problems after loading the most recent drivers
for my Soundblaster Live card. Not sure if this would work for you,
but I set reverberation to 0% through the Audio HQ, Environmental
Audio function. I also set the environment to Normal Multi Speaker.
Don't know why but it was set to "cave" before that.

Anyway, good luck.
