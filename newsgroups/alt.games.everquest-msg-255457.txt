OK, checked out the DL.  Out of the question for dial up but I'll
either download through another computer....T1 at work 8-) or a
friends cable.  U see, where I live there is no cable as of yet or
dsl.  I thought when i finally bought a house I'd have cable and it
would be sweet.  Imagine my surprise when no cable or dsl available,
only satelite at 139.00 a month.  Too steep.

Anyway, your assurances that dial up works for the game are
comforting.  I'm a BG fan and almost always go for a ranger type
charcter so I think I'll be ok.

Again, thanks for all the helpful input.
