Easy:

- Property: You have to have offices, you have to have a place to keep the
servers.
- Staff: Not just game support staff -- office staff, janitors, PC tech
people, etc.
- Supplies: Paper, diskettes, toner, etc.
- Bandwidth.  It takes a lot of bandwidth to support 420k people.
- Hardware/Software: Server hardware breaks with heavy use.
- Taxes: Did you know that your boss pays more taxes on your paycheck than
you do?
- Utility Expenses: Servers don't power themselves.
- Co-Location: Servers also don't back themselves up.
- Advertising/PR/Marketing.
- And so on. . .

You can see how this can start to add up.
