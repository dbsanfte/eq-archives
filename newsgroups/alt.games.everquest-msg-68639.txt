2.2 doesn't for me, nor did the one before it for that matter.

I wonder if it's the DirectX - on my PC in a window everything is a bit
fuzzy, at 16 or 32-bit color depth.  Almost better to just run it full
screen even with *only* one PC.

I think by now the only thing I don't have printed out and on-hand for quick
reference would be all the Luclin info - which I'm pretty sure is forth
coming, at least that Luclin stuff which I don't figure out on my own. =)
