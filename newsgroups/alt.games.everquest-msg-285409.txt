My wife has played SWG fanatically since before NGE.  She would
absolutely LOVE it if they rolled that disaster back, but at this
point she's been doing whatever is necessary to mothball her equipment
and has closed her two accounts.  She hasn't noticed any gradual
rollback.  In fact, it sounds like SoE is been gradually discarding
the stuff that made SWG unique in order to copy WoW.

So it's not impossible that SoE will see the error of their ways, but
at least according to my wife, doesn't look like it's happening.
