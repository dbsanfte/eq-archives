I can confirm that he does still pop. I camped the underwater tower for
about 5 hours over 3 days for the druid epic (did this solo btw). His
placeholders are the 3 (?) Deepwater goblins in the top of the tower. This
is the same place as Deep spawns. He spawned in the middle, i.e. with 1 DW
Goblin on either side. Con'ed dark blue at 52 I think, maybe 51. Didn't
aggro. Must be very rare. When I did spawn him, I altered our Cleric, but
dunno if he got to him in time. I believe he has a 2hr despawn timer.

For what you've posted, you must just be unlucky.

Oh btw, if he is up, only 2 DW goblins spawn, he must count as third one. If
deep is up 3 DW goblins spawn, on right on her...i dunno if the Lord & Deep
can be up together...you might need to drop Deep as the Lord may ONLY spawn
in the centre so she could be his placeholder :(
