WTF.  I generally try to just read and mind my own business, but, what *did*
you do?

What happens when the kids who post "you suck" run into someone like this:

*Taken from the dark side of Usenet and no I don't think the following is
funny and I quote*

Stop calling me a "mentally ill lunatic." You are not qualified to do so,
and those who are so qualified would not use that language. The first thing
you need to do is summon up enough courage to admit who the hell you are and
provide a real e-mail address that doesn't insult the reader. I place little
or no value on psychiatric diagnoses that come from clowns without names.

You obviously didn't bother to follow the links provided in the message to
which you are replying. You don't want to be confused with facts. In case
there are any decent human beings reading these messages, however, I'll
provide a bit more information.

Many government whistleblowers in this country (corporate whistleblowers,
too) suffer persecution, deprived of life, liberty, or property without due
process of law and denied the equal protection of the law. For many years,
because of my free exercise of First Amendment rights (whistleblowing), I
have lived with the knowledge that a group of sick people associated with my
former employers are out to hurt and discredit me in any way they can -- to
get me into trouble and cause me as much loss as possible.

My former employers broke all their own rules and laws and got away with it.
They speciously denied my union grievances, neatly circumvented my request
for access to records under the New York State Personal Privacy Protection
law, corrupted the Office for Civil Rights of the US Department of Health
and Human Services, and encouraged criminal punks to harass me. A trusted
roofer told my wife and me that somebody had actually drilled holes in our
roof!

My employers conspired with my neighbors to kill my dog in 1987. They
terminated my job through an illegal 1988 _ex parte_ arbitration hearing at
which I was too sick to be present and at which my interests were utterly
unrepresented. The New York State Public Employment Relations Board, in
1989, dismissed without a hearing my Improper Practice Charges against my
union and the State. I could not file suit in New York State in hope of
reversing these actions. No lawyer would represent me.

On October 14, 1989, my car (used and parked that day by my wife) was
destroyed in a suspicious "accident." The insurance adjuster tried three
times to coerce my signature on a fraudulent "power of attorney" form that
incorrectly indicated the car's serial number. Had I signed that form, I
could have been prosecuted under New Jersey law and sent to jail for two
years. When my wife sued for divorce in 1990, no lawyer was willing to
represent me in disputing the cause of action. I had to appear _pro se_ at
the divorce trial in 1991.

My former employers and their associates in the law enforcement,
intelligence, military, medical, and psychiatric communities have prevailed
upon individuals, organizations, agencies, and officials to ignore me,
insult me, or try to discredit me. In their effort to rid themselves of this
whistleblower and cover up their previous crimes and scandals, they told
people whatever they needed to tell them in order to turn them against me.
They distorted anecdotal information they had gathered, presented images in
a false light, doctored other images, hired impersonators, suborned perjury,
falsified official documents, used computer databases maliciously and
falsely, and planted "evidence" to be retrieved in subsequent illegal
searches and used at secret, non-adversarial "evaluations." The discussion
"Psychiatric Discreditation"
<snip URL> on my forum provides
details.

The most serious slander was the absurd allegation that a court had declared
me "mentally incompetent" in 1987. No papers concerning this were ever
served on me, nor will anybody discuss it openly, either vocally or in
writing. It is the subject of a whispering campaign of hate propaganda and
innuendo.

When my employers served me with a Notice of Discipline calling for my
termination on charges of insubordination and time abuse, I resorted to my
union for representation. Public Employees Federation appointed Ms.
<snip name>, Esq. to represent me in my disciplinary arbitration. She
eventually withdrew, and the union refused to appoint another attorney, but
that's another story. My letter of August 20, 1988 to Ms. <snip> contained
the following:

"I must state at this point what I believe may have
occurred in August, 1987. Someone named <snip>
appears to have been declared mentally incompetent. I do not
know in what state this took place, nor do I know whether
there really is a <snip>. I am not <snip>.
I have never been informed of any mental incompetency
proceeding against me, and my one and only wife has no
knowledge of any such proceeding. I have previously
documented that during 1986, 1987, and 1988, I have had no
lawyer representing my interests.

"My employers, and persons and agencies associated with
them, appear to have involved themselves in this proceeding
against `<snip>' for the purpose of depriving
<snip>of life, liberty, and property without due
process of law. I have reported to <snip> that Mr.
<snip> and his associates have `used the computer
scientifically' in compiling a list of slanderous allegations
and scurrilous insinuations for the purpose of attacking my
character and reputation. These lies have been communicated
to many persons in an effort to `avoid controversy' regarding
the program of illegal harassment, endangerment, coercion,
intimidation, terrorism, and torture to which I have been
exposed."

Over the years, I have entertained several theories about "<snip>."
I have finally found the answer. The 7 March, 2000 edition of the
_Home News Tribune_, my local newspaper, contained the obituary of the late
<snip>, a retired real estate agent and Democratic
Committeewoman in Middlesex County, NJ. Among her survivors are <snip> and
<snip> of Orlando, Florida.

I never knew Mrs. <snip>, nor am I aware of having met any
member of her family. I have no wish to stain her memory or the reputation
of any of her relatives. I doubt that anybody connected with <snip> of
Orlando, Florida has ever done anything at all to me, nor do I wish to
invade his privacy or that of any other <snip> (there are more than a
hundred of us in the USA).

Most importantly, I am not calling anybody "mentally incompetent." That's
the term used by my satanic former employers. I suspect that these monsters
have done terrible things to many of us. They may have cheated one of us out
of a five-million-dollar Reader's Digest Sweepstakes prize (see the <snip
url>
section of "Fantasy Interrogation" on my web site). I must, however, pursue
this issue,
for my sake and in the name of truth and justice.

I am subjected to the torture of "Marlin Fitzwater's Private Purgatory"
<snip url> in all its aspects --
electromagnetic, bio-chemical, and terroristic. Notably, the
"understandings" imposed by the US Senate in its 1994 ratification of the
Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
or Punishment provide convenient loopholes for just the kinds of abuses to
which I and others have been subjected
<snip url>.

<it goes on, but you must get the point by now>
