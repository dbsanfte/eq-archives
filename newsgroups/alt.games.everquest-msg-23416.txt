A good rule of thumb is that any skill that, at level 1, shows a minimum
level when you visit a trainer, you'll need to put a point into it at that
level.

If you go into your trainer at level 1 and you notice the Dual Wield skill
listed, and in the box it says "Level 14," it means you'll have to put a
point into it to utilize it.

Taunt is an obvious exception to this rule of thumb...at least for warriors,
since you GET that skill at level 1 and it shouldn't look any different than
any other skill you can put points into (I don't have a warrior so I don't
know for sure).
