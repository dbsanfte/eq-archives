I think one of the problems with this argument is that the only example the
company provided was that in a car racing game, the richest player gets to
have a better car, but what was not mentioned was whether the same car would
be attainable by skill. If not, would you still play?

If the rules are bent by cash, then why not have MSChess, where the more you
pay, the more pieces you get, and every $500 gets you an automatic
checkmate?

If a MMOG bends the rules for the people who pay the most then why not have
some player buy their way to Shiva-dom?
