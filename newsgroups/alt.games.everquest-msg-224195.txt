    Be sure, as another poster said, to clear the adds out before you pull
and fight him. If your healers don't have AE heals other than MGB Ethereal
Elixir, expect the fight to be a pain. After he dies, get everyone in camp
cured ASAP, then start ressing folks in and hailing the PP while looking out
for adds.

    Depends on the AA levels as well as gear. People who just hit 65 and
people who are 65 with 80+ AA's are very different in power, even with the
same gear.

    When faeries are summoned, pull all DPS off TT and kill the faeries.
Once they're all dead, go back to killing TT. Some people like to run and
dodge the AE dispel, others just have casters be ready to MGB pertinent
buffs right after it happens. I find MGB to be a lot easier. At 25%-ish, the
gargoyles around the area come alive. These hit for about 1000 IIRC, but
don't summon. Most people just kite them around until TT is dead, then kill
them off.

    Good luck! It's a pretty fun fight, the clearing to TT isn't as tedious
as clearing in other encounters, and the loot is actually pretty nifty for
the difficulty.
