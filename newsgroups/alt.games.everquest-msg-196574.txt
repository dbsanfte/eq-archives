I'm guessing he ran them through the walls.  He was in front of the gate by the
tree with a couple in tow.  I had run up *over the hill* in the large open area
with my 2 centaurions when the Chief pounced on me.  I never even saw him
coming.  My druid can kite and I've never had the mobs running all over the
place like I've seen bards do at the RyGorr Keep.
