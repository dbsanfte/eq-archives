Hmmmmm  So you think HIV and AIDs education is appropriate for a 2 yr
old.

OK, if that's how you feel...   I guess we'll just have to agree to
disagree on this.

I feel that we should let a child be a child for a while before we
start introducing them to the horrors of the world...

But what you suggest WILL raise nice little PC robots...

They won't have much of a fun childhood, though..
