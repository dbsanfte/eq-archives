    That's a tired old argument, and the response is basically this: Without
buying the newer expansions I would completely lose contact with my friends,
and thus be unable to play at all (since I have a non-solo class (arguably))

    Maps in particular though, the *only* reason I bought LoY was that my
guild was raiding there.
