me:  a 45 Halfling Druid.

I sold many pelts to vendors or dropped to the ground as a youning...mainly
because I needed coin or space.  Now I wished I hadn't gotten rid of them.

I did the same to silks when hunting spiders in EK.  I wish I hadn't gotten
rid of silks either, but I am fortunate to be able to hunt in DL in groups
for decent amount of silk collection.

I spent this past weekend begging lowbies for pelts.  Some had a one or two
to sell. many had variations; low quality, med quality, etc.  I buffed some
of them for the trade or simply gave them a plat or two.

I got a few ruined combines to get my skill up to 21.  I prefer not to use a
skinning knife on a low or med quality pelt because some of the upper
recepies require those pelts.

now to my point:  Am I stuck begging lowbies for their ruined pelts?  Or is
there a zone that allows for hunting of my level for these items?  I quad
kited cougars in IC for 4 levels....so many skins dropped...but no ruined
pelts. plus, no tailoring recepies have snow cougar pelts for tailoring and
they dont stack. triple sucks.

why would verant allow one to develop just about every other trade by
purchasing items from vendors, but require tailoring to be scoured from the
land?  It makes zero sense.

I scoured vendors in lowbie areas...maybe a pelt or two...same goes with
silks.

I scoured the forums...no pointers as to hunting.  Some suggest to basically
camp in EC...and trade druid buffs for pelts and silks.  I'd prefer to be
out hunting in DL or something and gain XP...not sitting on my finger hoping
to get a pelt or two.

Tailoring is the one skill that I truly want to develop.  I'm already a
master baker and brewer...smithing is coming along slowly...around
80...fletching is around the same.  not going to do jewelry.  (does shawl
require jewelry skill by one doing the quest?)  haven't started
pottery...but will soon.

A tailor is what I want to be damn it!  :p   help please....

any suggestions?
