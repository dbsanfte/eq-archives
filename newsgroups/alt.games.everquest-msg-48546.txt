My "new" druid is a little under equipped, well, considering he's 45th VERY
under equipped. So I thought I'd go after some Druid quest armour..erm, is
there any? Warriors get crafted, Rangers Ivy Etched, SK's Darkforge, Bards
Lambent, etc...It would seem druids do not get such a thing (I guess neither
do Monks)
This just means I'll have to buy some ES armour for him, I have a few
thousand plat (which is really for my warrior but I guess he can wait) so I
could poss buy one or 2 pieces.
Any suggestions of any items I could look out for (never shopped for a
priest class before) here's a list of his weaker locations.
Head, Savants cap (my obvious choice would be Runed circlet)
Wrists, Studded leather (RMB's I guess)
Legs, Leather (not sure, maybe ES if I can geta  good price)
Feet, Kobold Hide boots (Gebs but  a little pricey for what I want)
Back Leather cloak (from what I've seen most good wis cloaks are high cost,
may have to drop into permafrost and try and get a mammoth hide one)
Neck, I'm trying to get a BA medallion but on killing Unak the last 2 times
he has dropped nothing.

Any other suggestions would be welcome.

Thanks

On the plus side my Warrior has made 48th, has 3 blues till 49th and should
hit 50 in less than a week, thanks to the help of a second account.

Pet Druids, every Warrior should have one ;ï¿½)
