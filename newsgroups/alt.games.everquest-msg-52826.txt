You can't post on those boards, but you can send replies to their
threads.
These are then read by the powers that be.
They are collated by an army of gnomes in a sorting office.
A band of errudites perform statistical analysis on the replies.
Then on reply in about a thousand is picked out.
Policy dictates that those picked are :
1) Representative of the replies received
2) The most succinct and clear of those replies
The chosen reply or replies are then posted to the thread by one of VI's
Uber-Heiracy

There have been rumors that VI actually only read about one in one
thousand of the mails received (By picking them out of a hat) and that
they bin any that raise ugly questions or are out of kilter with The
Vision. These rumors are however unfounded and I will not repeat them
here.
