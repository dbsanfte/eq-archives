Our guild uses level attained sometimes as a tie-breaker to decide on raid
loot. But lately some of our members have started to focus on AA. It seems
that a level 56 with 14 AAs is a "higher level" than a 57.

Is there a formula uyou can use to caclulate Levels vs. AA exp to figure out
which actually has more exp?
