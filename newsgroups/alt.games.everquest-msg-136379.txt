Vaniki is no tougher than Terror in PoF, The Spiroc Lord isn't such a tough
mob, but clearing his isle IS a bitch, and its really time consuming.
Thats not even mentioning the Queen (chardok) and supidly over-contested
Sev.

Swiftblade is the one from Statue, not totally sure of the price (im not the
guild banker), but its probably in the region of a fungi tunic price

The CT one - I can't recall its name.. probably drops in 4c (pretty tough
area), somebody here can answer this

An end-game melee earring drops from the gnome quest, which I assume is
tagged warrior only, first.
