Or even provide spot-heals on the MT and SA when the CHC lags.  Druids are
often assigned the unenviable task of "heal everyone".  It truly depends on
your numbers and the particular raid, and it may take you a while to get the
healing duties for everyone just right.

Normally, no.  I can't tell you the number of times I've been in a CHC, see
my heal land with the MT apparently at full health and get the message, "You
have healed MainTank for 4867".  And as you fight mobs that start triple-
and quad-hitting for obscene amounts of damage, you just can't afford to
duck out of heal, ever.

Now, having said that: when I'm desperately low on mana (like some of those
Time mobs that cast the AE mana dot, curse them), I'll risk ducking out of a
CH.  But only when it truly is desperate and I have practically no mana to
spare.  It's an emergency tactic, and not one you should use with an
frequency at all.

We had a rousing debate about this a year ago.  Eventually we agreed to stop
calling out fast heals and save the healer channel for really important
spam.  This is entirely up to you, however.

Just do what feels right for you and your other healers.  As with all
things, working this kind of stuff out just takes a bit of practice and
patience - lots of the latter.
