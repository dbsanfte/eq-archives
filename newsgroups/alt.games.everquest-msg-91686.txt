How could I fail to notice that there is only one class (wizard) less
likely to be invited into a pickup group than my own (paladin).  Most
people lack the wit and imagination to do anything they haven't seen
somebody else do.  The fact that a particular approach to anything is
fashionable does not endow it with the least bit of virtue.

Most people that I encounter in EQ I don't care to get to know.  Very

nearly all of those that I do get to know are unaffected by levelling
disease.  The few who do have a mad urge to achieve high level as
quickly as they can still group with any decent soul they encounter
regardless of class.  They just do it in places where xp can be
gained rapidly.  For what it's worth, the only name on my ignore list
at the moment is a cleric who ooc'd for a group with words to the
effect of "don't even bother sending me a tell unless you have an
enchanter", she will be on ignore as long as i play the game.

The day EQ becomes a "job" is the day my account is cancelled.
