...Heh. My family had a dog, at one point, who we caught holding a forkful 
of lasanga in his paw. No kidding. And using it properly, too, to get the 
lasanga up out of the tray. Scared my brother to death - he'd just 
finished reading The Wolfman.

We also have a dog who refuses to acknowledge the existence of the back 
door. He's completely broken it, once, to the point that he'd slam into it 
and whiz through without it even slowing him down.

And wolves have been known to watch people, then operate the doors 
themselves to get at the food. (The dog with the fork was half wolf, which 
might explain it...)


Anyhow, another April Fool's joke might be played on Iksar - they get 
Slowed when the sun's down and it cools off.
