yet there were folks who played those for a long time with the same
characters they built up over time, and these were the games EQ was
modelled after.

and AW2 by AW3, I played them all, go ask AW'ers why it died, saying it
died because of low numbers is dumb, why the low numbers?  Same thing I
am talking about, not understanding what the customer wants, or maybe
understanding but putting those bean counters on a higher priority. 
Basically trading long term for short term, once the community perceives
rightly or wrongly that they are being taken for a ride the end is close
at hand.

and if you think AW is a "frag arena model" you have very little idea of
what it was about.... go back to your comment on EQ being a chat room
and you are closer to the truth.

depends on what you want out of the game, one of the great things about
EQ is not everybody has to have the same goals but some type of
character development is foremost in most minds I think its safe to say.

I don't have to, those that know what I'm talking about know what I'm
talking about but the past in not as important as the present and future
anyway and THAT is what I'm talking about.

I didn't say they didn't care, why don't you read what I did say and see
if you can understand it, oh wait, nevermind, if you haven't gotten it
by now.

hahaha

thing is dude, we don't have to agree, there is no need to argue, I'm
just saying what I think, you got a problem with it I guess.
