Sorry to jump in here, but I can't find the original reply to my own post 
in this thread.

I'll tell you like I tell my kids. You don't have to be entertained 100% of 
the time your eyes are open, and often times the potential for 
entertainment exists right under your nose, but you refuse to look for it.

Like I said elsewhere, give me a good idea that will reduce downtime 
without trivializing all the milestones along the way or making them non-
events and I'll be right there supporting you.
