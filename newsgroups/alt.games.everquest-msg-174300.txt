Nice rant, and I mostly agree with it, even though I lean left. I do 
have a problem with the last sentence, though. The US is not a charity, 
and it does not run its foreign policy as such. As long as the interests 
of the world and the interests of the US run parallel, yes, the US does 
what seems more beneficial to the world; but as soon as the interests of 
the US and the interests of the world at large seem to diverge, the 
world can go take a flying fuck, as far as the US is concerned (see the 
Kyoto treaty, or the different arms reduction agreements, for example).

Then again, the US government is sworn in to serve the interests of the 
US, not of the rest of the world, so in a sense they are just doing 
their job (and I won't pretend that every single other country in the 
world doesn't also look after themselves first and foremost), and hell, 
given the undeniable success of the US as a country, they ought to be 
congratulated on a job well done. Myself, I've lived in the US, I've 
loved it, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat, so you won't find any 
posts of mine bashing the US as a country. This doesn't mean that I have 
to agree with, like or even respect every one of their foreign policy 
decisions.
