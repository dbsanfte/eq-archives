> god, you think it's so easy. to do that. obvicly your living in a dream land.

"obviously" huh ??  Actually, it IS that easy.  History ALONE will tell
you what the fate of them their Pali's are...  Case in point, look at 
Japan, playin that dam kamikazi shit just like them Pal'is with their
bomb vests, and BLAP! - they take the BIG one up their ass, and then
they suddenly woke up, got all passive, content, and even got pretty
smart. So much so that they disbanded their entire military, and look
at em now - turned out pretty advanced and Ok huh ? Spanked them hard
and they turned out great.  Keep coddling the Pali's behavior, and
one day someone's gonna spank them real hard too!.   If they had any
sence, they'd skip what is gonna get them, and go straight to being
industrialized and getting smart, productive, etc.

 Why do we *not* see any fine goods come out of the Pali's lands
like we do from the Swiss, Germany, Japan, India, Pakistan etc ??
