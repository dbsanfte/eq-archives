Thanks for the input.  Knowing that it still worked enabled me to
figure out what happened.  It used to be that the food in the top
inventory slots was used before the food in the bags.  I had food in
the bag in the number one slot and that food was being eaten before
the food in the number five slot.  When I put the food "ahead" of the
food in the bag, the stat enhancement worked.
