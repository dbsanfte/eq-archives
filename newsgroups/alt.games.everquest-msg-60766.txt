Greetings:

Been lurking here for a short time, so please forgive if question has been
asked.

I've been out of the country for the past three years and will be returning
soon, my question is, what does everyone think about the current state of
EverQuest?

I had to give up my Ultima Online account b/c of the cost of connecting
(Asian countries, many still "pay-as-you-go" type accounts, meaning no such
think as unlimited access) became astronomical for my pay scale.  Anywho,
I'll be returning to the states soon and am looking into either UO,
EverQuest or the new King Arthur (forgot the actual name) version, what is
everyone's thoughts?  Of course, posting on a.g.e, I'm assuming it will be
biased towards EQ.. :)

Just looking for information.. thanks!
