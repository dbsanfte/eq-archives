You miss my point.  I'm not concerned about my ability to buy another V6 
5 speed pickup anytime soon.  I'm concerned that the sales of said model 
were so low that they've discontinued it now.  That means that for the 
past couple years not many people have decided for a higher gas milage 
version of the F150, and that in the near future even if they -do- want 
that it won't be available.

I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about the implications about our 
culture and the planet.

I'm not asking for people to drive around in a roller skate, but I'm 
reasonably sure that most f150 drivers don't ever NEED the added power 
and convenience of that V8 and automatic tranny.  All things being 
equal, so what?  But since we're looking down the barrel of running out 
of those fuels, and since we're already in deep sh*t because we can't 
live without the extra 15% supply of oil coming out of the mid east, 
things really -aren't- equal.  Things suck, frankly, and wasting fuel 
for no reason makes them suck worse.

I'm plunking $50 a tank into the F150... but like you, I care about 
having room for my kids (and for sheets of steel, half tons of coal, a 
couple months worth of living gear, plywood and 2x4s and so on).  I got 
what I need, but what I avoided doing was getting more than I need, to 
cruise around feeling cool about myself when what I'd really be would be 
another jerk wrecking the planet for my kids and their kids.

If I had the cash to throw around, I'd get myself that VW bug which 
would be all I'd need for 75% of my driving time, kids or no kids.

Sadly, I can't see blowing that extra cash right now, even though I'd 
like it -and- be doing my part to help control this problem.  But 
someone plunking down an extra $600 for the V8 instead of the V6 isn't 
saving money, he's spending MORE to do the wrong thing!  How hard is it 
to do the right thing when its also cheaper?

Pretty hard, starting next year, when the V6 F150 won't exist at all.
