Well for the "most camped mob in the game", I have received 2 Testaments of
Vanear's this week.  Once I logged in at 9:00 am EST, and 2nd 6:41 pm EST to
find Dyllian and loot my page 30.

For anyone leary of this quest I strongly recommend it, as 10 WIS 10 MANA
item isnt too bad for a quest that a lvl 20ish and up can obtain, and only
for 5pp max.

Note: Each time I killed him wasn't after a patch or anything.  Just camped
my character there and checked each time before I played, luckily I didn't
have to check more than once.
