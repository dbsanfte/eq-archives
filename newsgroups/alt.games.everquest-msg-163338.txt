On The Rathe, I've seen a LOT of absolutely pathetic names, and even
characters named after Pokemon and Dragonball Z characters.
I will confess, however, that I myself have a lvl 12 Monk alt named
Dherrunkynn (who I may be deleting, but I planned to make his surname
`Mastyrr'; Yes, I AM a Jackie Chan fan), and once thought of creating a DE
or Iksar character and naming him `Badguy Mcnastypants'.....for about five
seconds.

My goal with Dherrunkynn was for him to have drunk every single type of
alcohol in the game by the the time he was high enough to start his Epic
quest. I decided on this before I created the character, and since `Drunken
Master' is one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies......

(I'm considering selling all his gear and deleting him, though; haven't used
him much since the Monk nerfing, and spend more time using my Ranger alt)
