"Harder" items do not give you any greater chance of getting
a skill increase.

But you DO need to make sure you're making arrows that are at
least "hard" enough to get ANY skill increases from -- double-check
that you're not getting the "you can no longer advance your skill
from making this item" message, although it's so self-explanatory
that I doubt you'd make that mistake.

It sounds like your biggest problem is a low INT/WIS.  The higher
of those two stats DIRECTLY affects how likely you are to get
skill increases.  And since you're a druid and WIS directly
affects the size of your mana pool (and thus how many spells
you can fling before going Out of Mana), you have a double
incentive to start cranking your WIS as high as possible
with WIS-enhancing jewelry, armor, and other equipable items.
