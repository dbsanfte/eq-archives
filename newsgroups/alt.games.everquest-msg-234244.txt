Or, similarly, they may be one of those folks who got duped into buying a 
copy of EQ where the CD key had already been used (like, used on ebay, or 
bought one that had been returned to the store).  We all know, because we 
play EQ, but those who haven't played EQ may not realze how important that 
'do not purchase if seal is broken' seal is. :)

If such a thing happened to me, I'd be trying to make what I could of my 
loss, by looking for a free server.

Of course, odds are, DT's colorful sobriquet applies.  But ya never know.
