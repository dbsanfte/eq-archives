WRONG
The character exists on your "Account", and your account defines which
server the character is on. 

>Talk of "how hard it is for VI to delete characters" just isn't realistic, IMO. 

If 10% of the 400K user base are running Win95, and half of those
demand a refund, that turns out to be 20K accounts to be removed.
30+ Servers with 8 slots per server....... The "easiest" thing to do
is to nuke the account (which deletes all characters no matter which
server they are on). 

>They do it whenever they have a need to do so.

Like when they ban an account. The account is removed from the system.
(characters deleted)

>The character and item files are clearly some sort of database implementation and deleting
>records should be trivial to implement.

For 10-20K people or more? I think not. Some form of database
scripting would be required, and any mistake made could result in
disaster. Simply flagging 10-20K accounts for removal is a monumental
task.

>From my experience, I'd guess that they're running a database

It's not size that's an issue, it's total number of records.

Any tech who thinks a DBA is lazy should have his head examined.
