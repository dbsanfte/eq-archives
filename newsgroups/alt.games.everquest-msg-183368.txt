    When you box a cleric, you do it before the big mob that just ate a
bunch of people eats you. It's an emergency measure, so there's usually not
much "later" available. Most places don't have mobs that camp corpses,
though, and if they do then hopefully your SoS rogues used Escape and SoS so
they can drag bodies clear of the carnage, then move the mob away from where
the cleric will reappear. Last night I only had one res box poof on me, and
it was a pally res so I didn't really want to take it anyways. ;-)
