Yeah, I scored higher than that on GRF. All strongly disagrees on the 
subject with a 4 on getting back at those who piss me off, and I got a 
55%. I don't think there was enough of a question base to begin with 
either. Otoh, I very much like the immersion factor, but since I'm not 
too interested in creating a background story and don't rp all *that* 
much, I got a very low IMM.

Very interesting idea, though, and the site was very well done.
