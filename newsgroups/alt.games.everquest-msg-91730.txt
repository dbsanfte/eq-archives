    No, I never got the chance. My new guildmates did, which is part of the
reason the Sleeper was awoken on my server (the big reason being my guild
forcing a NToV rotation on the other big guild).

    At vastly reduced rates. To get the same primal quantities now would
require a lot more trips to the zone, which means more time wasted gathering
people, CotH'ing to the proper spots, etc.

    Well, those Clawed Guardian Bracers and SoDs were VERY nice. And the
monk robe looks to be very nice, too.

    Because the zone is now below what a guild would consider acceptable
risk plus time versus reward. It's the same as saying "Western Wastes is
useless as an XP zone". It isn't useless by the technical meaning of
useless, since you can go there and you can get XP by killing things. But
given how slow it is to get XP there (crazy solo rangers notwithstanding),
for all practical purposes the zone is useless for XP.

    Both. Verant for not having the foresight to see what would happen from
this, although I'm forgiving of them - they tried, it failed, they haven't
done it again (as far as we know). The guilds for destroying content for
themselves and other, mostly.

    Very valid point, except for one thing: you can kill the Warders without
waking the Sleeper. As long as ONE Warder is left up, the script doesn't
take place (unless you get bugs). Servers that haven't woken the Sleeper
have agreed rotations on the Warders, to prevent anyone from accidentally
waking him. It can be done, if the will is there.

    As for encouraging players to do something, Verant wants us to do a lot
of things that aren't in our best interest. "Buy a horse for the status
symbol! Please!" Feh. They even go back on things they want us to do -
Township Rebellion on Stormhammer was told in no uncertain terms they were
NOT allowed to wake the Sleeper on day one of the server.

    STOP. What is the reward for waking the Sleeper? Quantify it - is it
loot? No, you get more from leaving the Warders alive. Is it status? No, on
just about every server where the script went off people show disdain to
outright hatred of the guild that did it. Is it an advantage over others on
the server by denying them a chance to kill these mobs? Bingo. There's your
brass ring. Some prize.

    Which is almost everyone on each and every server, including people who
come to the game after the Sleeper has been woken.

    Verant made a bad situation possible. The guilds are the ones who pull
the trigger on it.

    Bah, true. :-) Still, there are precedents - the two handed damage
upgrade, the upgrading of NToV loots.... These things weren't done by the
majority of the player base, though, so your point is still taken.

    You're right. I tell the other guild we have a rotation with on that
dragon "get your ass here and clear this ASAP, stop holding up our spawn".
:-) Mature servers set up rotations on mobs that a limited number of folks
can kill, and once that limited number gets too big (usually around the time
the top guilds don't want it anymore) it goes FFA.

    I'm in Lotus Cult. We killed the AoW for the first time on our server
last night. We're a fairly good guild. :-) Yes, that's a recent change.

> You must hate competition of any sort.

    No, I hate senseless strife. Because it usually indicates wasted
opportunity. In the time that guild B spends rushing past guild A they could
have gone and killed mob C and increased their own power instead of trying
to hold another's constant. I want a server capable of scoring server-wide
firsts, no matter WHAT guild scores the prize. When all you do is hold
others down, you never get to that stage.

    I seem to do well enough at it. :-) Competition is good - grinding at
that big mob for failure after failure, knowing that if you can solve him
you'll have an exclusive until the other guilds also put in the time to
learn him/conquer him. Making a server stagnant is not.

    We have NToV on rotation with one guild, possibly a second guild
(they're JUST starting to enter NToV now). Kings are also on rotation -
whoever doesn't have NToV that week has Kings. When our tracking mules see
the other guild in a zone, we don't try to race them to the boss in that
zone - we find another boss and gack him. And my guild has ALWAYS been like
this, unlike the other two power guilds (one since disbanded, then recently
re-formed) which do fight with each other constantly. Guess we're just
different.
