Actually, this isn't as bad as originally expected.  If the only hell 
levels affected are 30, 35, 40, & 45, it's not too terrible.  I am very 
anxious to see how they deal with it.  I suspect that they just are going 
to give phantom exp, and it's only about 4% of the total EXP required to 
reach 60.  Hell, it's a lot less than when they did away with hybrid exp 
penalties.  Not that I agree with it, but since the pre-50 hell levels are 
a joke compared to 51-59, it's rather less of a problem than I expected.
