The funny thing is, I usually do halfway like you (which is why we are even 
having this spat- I have not killfiled you). You just fly off the handle 
waaay to easy.

Not including one of the most popular CPUs and one of the most popular 
sound cards in their testing regime does not strike you as negligent? It 
should.

Their existence alone is proof of inadequate testing. We aren't talking 
about the DIY In Your Garage CPU here, we're talking about the second place 
to the Pentium.

No, if someone ignores evidence and rabidly defends something they 
admittedly know sweet fuckall about, I have to consider them a zealot.

They have broken common configurations before.

Whereas the company that knows you won't leave because you are addicted to 
their product can treat you like shit and know you will come back for more.
