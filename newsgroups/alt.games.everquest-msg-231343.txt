Not necessary.   He's talking about the old, old days.   Used to be that the
inventory screen was in 640X480, no matter what resolution you played the
normal game in.   So every time you opened your inventory, it would bounce
you back to that.

I believe it was with Luclin that they completely removed the old interface.
The inventory screen he's talking about isn't in the game anymore.  You
couldn't get to it even if you wanted to.
