I think Verant has said that spells with secondary effects like
snare or stun have a second check but I have never seen any
proof one way or another. spdat file only shows one resist type.

I know one thing that is goofy and non-intuitive is that slow spells
all check against magic but can be removed with cure disease
not cancel/nullify magic spells.

This was implemented to allow players to remove slows without
wiping out other buffs. Unfortunately most of the player base is
clueless about this.
