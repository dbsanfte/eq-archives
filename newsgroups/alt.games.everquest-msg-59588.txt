Those are 2Hers from ST, they are absolutely drop dead common.  And
because VI made that zone the way they did it, it's either let it rot
on the corpse or give it Mort (or in my case the banker in Rivervale).

The gloves are junk, the staff is junk and the only thing even more
junk than those is the staff of the elder claw (they should just make
these droppable it's not like they would flood the economy or
anything).  I doubt there's a single staff of elder claw on our server
as it generally gets fed to a NPC the moment the looter leaves ST.
