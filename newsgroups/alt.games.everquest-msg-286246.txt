One option would be to join the Combine server.  Since its listed as the 
  new player server, a good chunk of the new and returning players end 
up there, so there's a constant influx of people on the newplayers channel.


Combine was more attractive early on, when you were starting out along 
with everyone else, though, now you'll be competing (to the extent there 
is a competition) with people who have a year under their belts.

This isn't a big deal for most classes, healers, DPS sorts and the like, 
but buffers will find themselves up against higher level buffers (a 
constant shaman complaint), slowers up against higher level slowers, and 
warriors competing for the coveted MA slot against higher level, better 
geared and more AA'd warriors.

A casual player won't care, but in certain classes, if you want to reach 
the top of your field, you'd pretty much be stuck waiting for another 
new server to open.
