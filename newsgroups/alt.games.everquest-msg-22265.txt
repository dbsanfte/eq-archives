You don't tell us in advance what character class you created, but here's a
couple really good ones to get you started:
http://www.castersrealm.com/
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/

The graphics may be "blocky and sucky" for 2001, but that's not a 2001
graphics engine. The design is three years old or better. This fall/winter
a new expansion, The Shadows of Luclin, will be coming out with new and
improved graphics, etc. You can see a preview of it at the homepage:
