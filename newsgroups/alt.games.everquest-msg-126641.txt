To be fair I think that the common people back then did believe that
witches existed. In fact a lot of people stilll believe this today. 
In their eyes they did have evidence. An argument, a sick cow, a witch.
Quite simple cause and effect, if you know noting of modern hygeine etc.
Also there is at least some evidence that some of the "witches" did
nasty things, probably closer to poisoning than witchcraft. A lot of the
hedgerow flowers and herbs can have a very potent effect, some medicinal
and some not quite so nice. The chances are that at some point someone
did poison their neighbours cow.

All of this then backed up and reinforced by the "educated" cleric class
is going to make people believe in witchs and demon summoning. If this
was the only education you knew then I susspect that you would not be
quite so dissmisive.

I will ignore your poke at faith in general.

Jim
