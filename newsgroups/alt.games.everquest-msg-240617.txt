I don't remember what level or class you are, but some skills (like
hide) are capped at certain levels. As a ranger, hide is capped at
50 for me. Since the other two are stopping at 70, I'm gonna guess
that you are level 13? Skills tend to cap at (5Xlevel)+5. Once you
hit 14, the ones that are able to will go up another 5 pts then
stop again.
