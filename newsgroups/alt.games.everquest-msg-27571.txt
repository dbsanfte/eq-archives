My usual response?  "Sorry, I don't know...but I bet you can find the answer
at www.allakhazamcom!"

My guild decided to infest Mistmoore tonight.  Seven people averaging level
48...definitely outclassed the zone.  I guess a few people were looking for
armor quest items for their alts.

ANYWAY, that same druid (now 45) wanted to go.  He asked where MM was.
Hokay, that's ok, because it's not very well populated by anyone...no reason
why he'd know where it is, he's pretty new to the game.  So I tell him...

Port to Steamfont and run to LFay.  In LFay stay around 0 north until you
get to about 0, p3000, then you can go south, and it's right around there.
His response, "can I go with you?"  ARGH.

Well, I made him do the work.  I grouped with him, targeted him and did
/fol, and said "you lead."

Bottom line is, you'll NEVER get to know Norrath if you constantly FOLLOW.
