Lol.  Hey, if being here for so long makes you uber, then I got
James and Martin beat.  The only name still around that I remember
from when I started reading is Biz.  (BTW - I started reading the
group before release, and the things said about EQ in it are what
made me decide to buy it - the day after release.)

Of course, I still don't have the knowledge of the high level game
they do - but I've been around forever, so I *must* be more uber
than them :-P
