1. Are the iksar advantages over humans actually worth the 20% experience
penalty?  Infravision is no big deal as cranking up the gamma at night can
easily solve that problem.  The regen is nice, but I don't plan on doing
much soloing.  Do iksar have any other advantages?

2. Are there any Quellious follower-only monk items that are worth anything?
I'd rather go agnostic but don't want to screw myself if there's some uber
item I won't be able to use.
