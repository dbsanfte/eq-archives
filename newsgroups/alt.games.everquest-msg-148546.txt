When harmonying a pack of mobs, make sure that the one you're pulling
is from the front of the pack. Harmony reduces "assist" and aggro
radius greatly, but it doesn't eliminate it entirely. If the pulled
mob runs "through" another, it will assist, harmonied or not.

As for hunting suggestions, my BL has been doing DL solo since about
level 40, he's 44 now and still going good. Making about 50pp or more
per day on straight coin drops, not counting the gems, merchant fodder
weapons, and giant tunics (the giant lord tunics go for more than 40pp
to merchants). Good balance of xp and loot....
