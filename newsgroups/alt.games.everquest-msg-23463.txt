Where do you people find these quests?  Odds of me
hanging out in Kaladim warriors guild are very low.

Anyway, I have everything I need except the Freeport Stout..
what the heck?  I found dwarven ale and elven wine in freeport,
but no sign of the stout.

Crashed out, thought I'd check on the web, but Allakhazam
doesn't have the brell symbol quests listed at all yet, far as
I can see.
