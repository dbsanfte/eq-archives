There was a lot of noise about it a couple years ago, various
folks posted results of tests in which they would pick mobs dry
and then kill and loot the mobs, finding one of each coin type
they had got using PP left on the mob.  Actually, as I recall,
several people posted that the "separate loot pool" thing was
a never confirmed rumor from beta.

As for grouping with rogues, my experiences with "stranger" rogues
have been uniformly bad, while my experiences with guildie rogues
and "friends of friends" have been uniformly good, so I never group
with unknown rogues.  And if some rogue-looking toon runs up and
stops when I'm fighting a mob that drops quest loot I have been known
to announce in /say that I'm /petition'ing them for grief play at
which point they invariably run off (yes, I have had quest bits
stolen more than once).  PP is the stupidest damned thing in the
entire game.
