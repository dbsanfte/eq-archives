Actually, I tried them again yesterday, and

/show_window inventory.Bank (no cap on the "i" in inventory)

worked for me, unlike a couple days earlier, and

/show_window inventory.Store (not Market)

also worked fine.

So, still don't know why the bank one did not work a few days ago, the 
market one was indeed a case of the wrong command.  In neither case did I 
have to capitalize the "i" in "inventory".
