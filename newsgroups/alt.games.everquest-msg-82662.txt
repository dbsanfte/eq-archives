Awright, Dude. ;-)  Good to see you. Ain't it great?  Is this Marjorie
Knoller some kind of manna from hell or what?  Who'd have guessed it could
happen?  Still, I always knew that in potential there has never been
anything quite like the 4th Gospel as a powerful source of Anti-Semitic
ammunition in argument were the Nazis ever of a mind to open up that
veritable arsenal to their use.  Now we see that they have.  Wow.

Marcion, a Roman citizen and the son of a wealthy ship builder of Pontus,
was, one might well suppose, the equivalent of an Aristotle Onassis of his
day.  Would he have had major influence at Rome in the Imperial Court?  Why
wouldn't he?  Of course such a person would have all the influence of such
people in his day and age as they do in this;  just as he had major
association with the Bishop of Rome, as he held a position of high authority
in ecclesiastical circles, even to the extent that he was doing work on the
canon, offering other versions of the Gospel Acc. to Luke to the Bishop for
consideration, a version which had been drastically cut as not to contain
teachings that he regarded as "Judaizing".  Marcion was finally
excommunicated and thrown out, for going just a bit too far with that
bowdlerized form of Luke, which was not accepted at Rome, yet strange as it
may seem, there are extant comments noted by Jerome (given as glosses in the
margins of certain codices of the New Testament) of early fathers who note
that they had seen copies of Luke which contained the story of the "woman
taken in adultery" which now appears only in "John".
What happened there? What kind of fiddling around was that? It might appear
that some of Marcion's offerings were accepted, and others not--i.e. we see
a parallel between issues relating the three:  Luke, Marcion, John. It
raises the question:  how much damage had Marcion done up to the point that
he was declared heretic and expelled?  How much of his poison had already
been injected into Matthew, into Acts and Luke?

Imagine a man with ships at his command, coming to Rome with vellum scrolls,
forgeries of his own production which he passes off as the original writings
of Paul and the Evangelists?  Picture a man who thinks of himself as a
powerful emissary between two worlds, that of the Church--which had
weathered the persecutions of Nero and after the turn of the Century was
starting to gain the tolerance of the authorities at Rome, depending on who
was on the throne, as things with the reign of Claudius had considerably
brightened.

Now we find this rich shipping magnate, Marcion ardently following the
religion of his mother, a faith that he'll use his powerful position to
represent to the secular authority at Rome that it might grow in acceptance,
gain in prestige, this new faith of Christianity, as he does so offer it in
a form that would be the most presentable to the Pagan consciousness--the
Gospel According to John, the so-called Epistle of "Paul" to the Romans. To
do this, he must tempt the Bishop at Rome to accept some amount of fiddling
with the canon, there must be some sacrifices made to suit the general
negative opinion of the Jews which had always been held at Rome, especially
since Nero, but due also to their continuing rebelliousness, the success of
their financial dealings at Rome which as always are envied and misjudged by
people who come out of cultures less profit-motivated and capitalistic in
nature. Why was that true among the Jews, who did that culture develop?
Because among the Jews more than any other people in the empire, the
institution of slavery was held in great disrepute.  Not that it wasn't
practiced, but always under heavy restriction and with a strong sense of
guilt over it since they had themselves all, at one time been slaves.

When there is a far lesser reliance on slave labor, a more active
laissez-faire culture of business acumen develops.  It is no prejudice, not
a stereotype to say that Jews are good in business. It is true and it is a
good thing which evolved due to the Jewish distaste for slavery.  And that's
all there is to it.  It is not racial it is a cultural characteristic seated
in the religion of the Jews.

But here is a man, Marcion, a businessman of the Roman empire who harbors
the age-old Gentile prejudice in his envy of Jewish business acumen.  All
the stereotypes every bandied about on the subject of the Jews, Marcion,
like Hitler, fully believes.  His father was always in competition with
Jews, and he hated Jews, one might suppose, for the same reason that others
do, should it be that a Jew is more successful in getting the better part of
a business deal.  That's business not matter who is doing it and who is
getting the best end of it, Gentile or Jew.

Again, here is Marcion, who would perform nearly two hundred years early,
quite the same thing that the Emperor Constantine did in the 4th Century.
First, however, the religion of Christ had to be cleansed of its Jewish
origin, with all its emphasis on that sort of morality and a strict
adherence to law.

Clearly, this is all speculation from a few, very few, known facts.  And the
facts are these.  The first major Holocaust against the Jews happened after
the appearance of the 4th Gospel at a time when the heretic Marcion was
active in the Church during the reign of Hadrian.  The Jewish Revolt of A.D.
70 was nothing compared to the crushing blow that came against Israel upon
the revolt of Bar Cochba during the reign of Hadrian which was in every way,
by the account of Eusebius, a bishop at Constantinople, a campaign of
extermination.  Even the names of all the burned cities were changed, as
Jerusalem and Israel as a Jewish nation went entirely out of existence as to
the make up of its population, even its name.

I say that it was the Gospel According to John and Hadrian with the lips of
the heretic Marcion to Imperial Ear that did it, with such an extremity of
exterminative violence.

That's what I say; it can't be proved as neither may it be disproved.

Here's the question that remains:  Did the Emperor Hadrian, in A.D. 139 by
counsel of the heretic Marcion--who I suggest may well have been "John" of
the 4th Gospel--find purpose and cause for execution of the first Holocaust
against the Jews by this "Good News" of "John"?  Hey, Dudes:  read all about
it in Eusebius--it was altogether as fierce as what the Nazis did, it was
the beginning of the Diaspora which left Judea, Samaria and Galilee so
entirely bereft of a Jewish population, that for many years hence there was,
according to that church father of the 4th Century, virtually none left in
the land.
