While not smartest thing but dropping a bag 15k of items in it and having it
take from you in front of you is very wrong in my book before Andari could
pick it up.
If your been in EC last few hours then sure you all know but those that do
not, avoid Dribbal like plague, has no morals at all. He already sold
andari's FBSS, reducer, 2 65hp 6ac rings, 2 orc fangs, spider full collar,
etc.
Or better yet tell him and his guild mythical alliance like mad, we lost
fellow player from this.
