I've done something similar to this on rezzes - particularly on high rezzes.
If I don't have enough to donate what I think it's worth - which depends on
how much hassle it is for the cleric, but is always going to be 30-150pp or
so - then I'll at least offer to play mana slave (bard) and otherwise do
things for them. I've done things like charging them back up, then dropping
group and pulling and snaring a few for them (sometimes, however, what they
are after is too high for me to do that), or whatever I can do. Basically,
their time is worth giving back some of my time.
