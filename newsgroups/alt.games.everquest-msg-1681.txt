I went to the shop where we'll probably have my wife's computer made (in another
month).  Since I want to replace my Rage II C to one which will run everquest
when I boot to WNT, I checked the prices.

They have lots of TNT cards, but their Cardex 32 Mg GeForce 2MX is $169.00.
They have 64Meg GeForce for over $300.   They won't trade in my old card (which
they installed when I bought that computer).  So I guess it's time to buy
on-line.

I don't know what brand to look for, but a quick search showed me much cheaper
Cardex GeForce cards.   I don't think I need to pay the extra money - I am
mainly paying for the W2K driver (nobody seems to upgrade drivers on old cards
for new operating systems).   I went years without needing 3D capability at
all.  (My Monster 3D card was purchased so that my son could run a Star Wars
game back when he lived at home).

Do I have any reason to spend more than the minimum GeForce MX 32 Meg price?
