Yes, I read "On Writing" (since I <am> a writer, I wondered what he had to
say about it), and I agree, it was a very good book. I enjoyed it immensely.
I read Bag O Bones and thought that it was about 200 pages too long ;)
though it was decent. I actually liked his Hearts in Atlantis (sp?) better.
Actually, the last book of his that I <really> liked was The Girl Who
Loved... shit, there goes the memory again!... some baseball player... Tom?
something? Crap, maybe I oughta just go stick my head in a bucket of cold
water for the rest of the evening... OH! I know what's wrong with me...
tonight is the last night for LoTR and I'm leaving in about 10 minutes! I'll
be saner and more coherent when I know I can't see it again ;)
