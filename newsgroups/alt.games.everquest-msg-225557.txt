Hmm, I don't agree.  As a group of 55th and 56th level characters we've 
taken on mobs in PoS and done quite well.  Which means that 55th 
characters can contribute to any group in the 2nd tier planes and still 
provide valuable contributions - not as much as 60th level characters, 
but then that's true anywhere.

55th level mages in the aggro-kite outer camp see to provide plenty of 
contribution.
