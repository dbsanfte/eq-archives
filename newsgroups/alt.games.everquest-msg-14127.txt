OK, I know very little of this Conquest Vs Verant exploitation of bugs
thing. I know of Verants policy and don't always agree with it, in some
cases it's obvious abuse and on others it's not so clean cut but I'm not
getting into the arguement (anyone post the url to this discussion, I'd be
interested to read it)
Back to your escape options;
All mobs move thru water as they do on land, so you cannot out swim one
(maybe with 200 but I wouldn't want to test it) mobs also ignore walls and
the Z- (vertical) axis...best way to escape them is either zone or run to
guards (assuming Valon and Colin are not dead at the time)
You can outrun most mobs on land by strafe running. Using the mouse to
control direction hold down forward and left or right arrow on keyboard,
you'll move slightly quicker and can outrun most normal speed mobs with
this.
