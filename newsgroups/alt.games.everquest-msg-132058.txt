Mind you, I haven't been in a guild with this type of point system
myself, but it seems that the chief complain raised is the issue of
"auction fixing" by certain classes.

Let's say a particular mob is known to drop Uber-SK_Item_01 which you
might assign a high value to. If the monks could all get together on it,
as friends, they might say,

"Ok. Bill, you've done a lot of raids lately. If it drops, you bid (2)
and none of us will bid. I'll take the next one, and Fred can have it
next Thursday if it drops. That way, we can save up our points to put in
*really* big bids on that All/All Uber_All_Item_02 if it drops. Sound
good?"

But tying in to the other part of the discussion, I can see where
placing too *low* of a value on items could stop the system from
working. Sounds way too complicated for me. :-( .
