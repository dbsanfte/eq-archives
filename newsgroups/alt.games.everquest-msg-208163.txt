Honestly, who really cares if a train is called or not?

Its so easy to miss a message in spam, or to have no clue which direction
its coming from, whether your in a safe destination, or in the middle of the
train tracks.  Or if your currently engaged in mobs, should you just
immediatly zone out when you see a "TRAIN"^"^&*"" message in shout?

Thats retarded, in busy zones you'd be zoning every 10 mins and never get a
kill.
