I'm going to guess EQ1?

Other than when they had a mistake in the prices of something, doing 
tradeskills in EQ1 was always a losing proposition money wise, unless you 
got into a tradeskill early enough to make the best items before too many 
others could make them.  There is still a decent player market for a fair 
number of player made items, but, in general, the required skill level to 
actually make them with any real chance of success is close to the 300 max, 
which is quite expensive to reach in any of the worthwhile tradeskills.
