In order of my encounter with them:
D'Vinn (sp?) in Crushbone
Emperor Crushbone
Holly Windstalker in QH
Various undead in Kithikor
Dorn in NRo
Chief Drooga (sp?) in WK
Goon in WC
Goons in OT

I'm sure there must be a few more, but those are the ones that stick out.

So far, all but the Goons in OT have been checked off the list at least 
once, most multiple times.
