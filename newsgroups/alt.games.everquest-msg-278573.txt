A very good read to a recent returnee to EQ and I agree and hope the
devs take notice of this.

I left EQ to play DAoC when DAoC released, this was just after Kunark
came out I think? I enjoyed EQ a lot so it didn't leave through
frustration or anything negative. I left because I loved the idea of a
game base on the Medieval periods, Arthurian myths, Vikings, Celts etc
because I'm a history buff especially for the Dark Ages and Medieval
periods. Also the guild I was in consisted for older mature player and
a lot of us were based in Europe, especially  the UK and Scandinavian
countries. A lot of my guildies shared my interest with the concept of
DAoC and decided to leave too. That's the potted history over :).

I loved DAoC and stayed there until quite a while after ToA came out.
I tried other games along the way naturally like us true MMORPG
junkies do, but I always returned to DAoC as my main game. I was
eventually lured away from DAoC to try the so-callled 'second
generation' games. I tried SWG for a while but realised it wasn't
going to get fixed although it had some great potential. Then I tried
EQ2. I played EQ2 for a few months but got sick of the 'on the rails'
nature of the game. All levels had  to go to certain zones, locked
encounters etc. I missed being able to help folks, buff them, explore
strange new areas even if dangerous or fatal at my level. I could go
on but you get the picture. 

Having taken out a Station Pass for EQ2 I thought I'd try EQ again. I
was aware that many new expansions had come out since I'd been away so
I dug out my backup of my EQ directory and reinstalled it. I picked up
some of the new expansions really cheaply. I started to play again
with all my characters based around Freeport. The highest were a DESK
and a Barb Shammie in the early 30's. Alts ranged from level 6 to
upper teens. I was impressed with how well the game had stood up. The
new interface was great once I got used to it. I ran around all the
zones I'd known but saw nobody else. There seemed nothing to do in the
areas I was familiar with other than solo. I saw nobody anywhere as
low level as me. I canceled my Station Pass as I wasn't going back to
EQ2 until many issues were addressed and my disappointment with trying
EQ again.  

Now if there was an expansion, as you have suggested, aimed at us
newbies and lowbies. One that got us involved with the game again,
lead us to the new areas with new quests etc. then I'd probably be
back paying SoE my money.

I have also revisited DAoC which is also suffering from the sparse
player problem otherwise I'd be back there also. But at least from
what I read that Mythic is actually doing what you suggest and aiming
at the new player or returning lower level players. How successful
they will be I don't know but I know that Catacombs is thought to be
an excellent expansion.

So for now I am playing WoW. I'm enjoying it as I play on a RPG server
and the jerk factor is low an stamped on quickly but it's just not EQ
or DAoC. I  yearn to play EQ and DAoC again and would return to these
games as my MMORPG staples if only there were a population and the
content was there to draw new players and get old players back. EQ and
DAoC are *still* great games, but no fun if you end up soloing or
running around for absolute ages trying to find another player.
