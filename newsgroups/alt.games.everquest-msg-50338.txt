And it sounds like there will be some sort of "fix" for this in SOL with
the bazarr zone or whatever it is called. I would guess that ideally
this would be set up as a sort of second bank where chars can put things
up for "ebay" style auction. i.e. dump you crap there, come back a week
later and see what got sold. House takes 10 percent.

Chances of this being the way it actually works ? about zero to five
percent.
