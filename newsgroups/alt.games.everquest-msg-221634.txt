Your repeatedly saying that doesnt make it so. Personally I find LDoN to be
one of the better expansions.

Oh, and for the record, Ive had PoV all to myself, for extended lengths of
time since the release of LDoN. Makes for some really nice solo AA's for my
druid. At any given time there are between 5-10 LDoN groups OOC'ing for more
in PoK.

Yeah... really unpopular, and worst expansion ever....  What ever....
