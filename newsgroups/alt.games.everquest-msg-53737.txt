I did get a beggar to do this once. It took a little wheedling to get
him to actually do it.

It was a thing of beauty - despite the limited graphics engine, I
really think I could see his fear when he realized that he had
challenged me, and I had accepted. He didn't get far before I reduced
him to cinders.

I never heard from him again. Maybe he decided that EQ was full of
jerks and decided not to play any more. One could hope.
