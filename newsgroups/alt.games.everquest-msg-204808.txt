    That's the first error. Most of the people I see twinked to that degree
don't want anything to do with a group. They find a nice solo spot and start
pounding out the XP. No downtime being LFG, no dealing with dysfunctional
group members, just go out and kill stuff. It's a very nice change for most
high-end players. So there's no real competition for group spots between Joe
Ubertwink and Bobby Baseline. Oh, and 100 K+ for a solid twink is a real
waste of cash. You can get a really well-geared character for much less than
that, closer to 20 K I'd estimate. 1 K per item slot really goes a long,
long way.

    But a healthy game doesn't want everyone clumped at one end. As a game
designer, you want people spread out amongst the levels. Making sure that
people can't skip large portions of content is the best way to do this.

    They're worried about backlash, and I don't blame them. They even took
significant heat when they level limited the proc on the Venemous Axe of the
Velium Brood, and that wasn't nearly as expensive an item as a Fungi. And
they would need a hard level limit and not a "recommended level" - worn item
effects still work regardless of the level of the user, and the power of the
Fungi is the regen and not the stats.

    I wouldn't doubt it. When you get frustrated with the game, start fresh
and have fun. Awesome replayability. But that replayability has come with a
price.

    A ton of stuff in Veksar has recommended level 45 on it, when no level
45 I know could be in the places those items drop. It's designed to be twink
gear. And it's working - my little 47 warrior already dumped her Jagged
Blade of Mourning for a Razor-Edged Shan'Tok, and her Enchanted Dwarven
Plate Greaves for Kylong Shinguards. AC 37 pants with a fair chunk of HPs,
recom. level 45? Sign me up!

    Couldn't agree more there. The newbie quests and the other low-level
changes make starting the game as easy as it should always have been.
There's a ton of stuff to learn when you first start playing, and I think
the changes help make that as painless as possible.

    There's other ways to modify the game to avoid this problem. For
example, add a new tag to certain items: No Trade. A No Trade item can't be
dropped, sold to a vendor (or in The Bazaar), or handed to another player,
but can be passed between your own characters via the shared bank slot. So
any item flagged No Trade would be useful as an item to twink with, but
wouldn't go into the general economy and cause mudflation with new players.
It's easy to envision a "new" EQ with this feature. Players would sell
tradeskilled items or raw components for tradeskill items. Tradeskill items
would have "baseline" stats and recommended levels. Items that dropped from
mobs would have stats better than those on tradeskill items aimed at the
same level, and would carry the No Trade tag. So if you want to twink a
character, you go out and obtain the twink items as drops or you pass down
your items. Maybe a system for EQ2?
