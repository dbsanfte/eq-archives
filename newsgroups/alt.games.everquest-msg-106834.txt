You don't need to break that camp - it is easily soloed. You pull to the
water side and their are 3 singles and 2 double pulls which are easily
soloed.

On the flip side I have been hunting those bandits for ages on different
characters purely solo, and see more obnoxious campers than fellow solo
players. You can be soloing the camp for hours, pleasantly co-existing with
a few other solo players and next thing you know some group waltzes in and
proclaims all the soloer's kill stealers. What they don't realise is that
most solo characters recuperate around the corners next to the second Mushy
or between that Maricella Slithera (sp?) and the closest building high on
the walls to avoid train aggro. They may have been there for hours before
they even woke up in morning for all they know.

I also have no time or desire to explain the facts of life to any group of
juveniles throwing a tantrum in OOC and just continue doing as I was
previously. I happily respond pleasantly to tells with a patient
explaination though. It drives the frothing idiots wild and doesn't bother
me in the slightest.

Any group that thinks they get sole rights over a 20+ high rate spawn in a
overcrowded zone needs a good lesson anyway.  If I see someone being
obnoxious and I have the time and ability, I will normally force a share on
the obnoxious person, even if I previously had no intention of hunting a
particular area at all.
