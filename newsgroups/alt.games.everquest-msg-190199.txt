This is definately how it was, but I'm no longer sure its 100% the
case anymore.

I just today did about twenty minutes of pling with a damage shield,
and I am fairly sure I was getting exp whether I was getting a hit on
every mob or not.

That would be a welcome change if true, but there were factors
involved that makes it impossible for me to say for sure.
