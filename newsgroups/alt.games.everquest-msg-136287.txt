correct me if i am wrong, (and i'm sure you will) but i think you are
missing the point of the entire comment, it's not an attack on the us
or a scapegoat. for some reason, the us tends to leave many countries
feeling inferior or pissed at them, not on purpose. some try to
measure up and take on traits and values, others just get pissed and
blame their own preexisting problems on the us. a select few can
manage to do both while still enjoying your top rated to kind of
crappy imports. (music,tv, movies, fashion etc)
