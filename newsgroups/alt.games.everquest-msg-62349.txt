Ya know, everyone in the business says to use the same LAN components
everywhere.  Got a 3Com shop?  Well, buy all 3Com NICs, hubs, and switches!

Well, I do have all 3Com hubs & switches but the NICs?  Nah.  I see no point
in it.  A cheapy NIC in your average shop (which is what I'd consider my
employer) is just fine.  So you only get 9Mbps instead of 10 (10bt), who
cares?  Who'd notice?  Meanwhile you save a ton of money...enough to buy 2
or 3 of those suckers before spending the money on one 3Com, and they last a
good long time.

I'm LAN Admin on a 10/100bT network with around 50 PCs.  In over three years
I've had to replace MAYBE 2 NICs...and those were 3Com.  Of those 50 PCs
probably 20 of them have integrated, Intel, or generic cards in them.
