Heh - the only one I use on my BL is
/g Attempting to slow %t
/cast 6
/cast 6
/cast 6
/cast 6

That gives my groupmates a 2 fold message

1.  I'm on the ball and slowing this thing.
2.  That 1300 hitter might be turning my way healer,
    keep an eye on my HP please.

The only one my mage has is

/g CoH incoming %t, disband on landing please

Mainly because people freakout if they are summarily
summoned, and because even experienced raiders often
forget to get out of the group to allow others to be 
invited and coh'd.
