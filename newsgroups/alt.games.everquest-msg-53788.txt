Ahh so there it is. The only reason is because you want to know. A selfish
and self serving act. The hell with others and all for yourself. Like I said
people that inspect without asking tells a lot about that person even if
they refuse to admit it. I have never found a reason to inspect someone. If
they want to show me some gear they will in the trade window. No drop gear I
can see it when I get it. get them to take a screenshot and send it to me
via email or look on a website. =)

I tell you it really irks me that in a crowded area you sometimes can not
help but get an inspection sometime. Another reason that it should be
allowed to be turned off. Very disrupting in a major fight.
