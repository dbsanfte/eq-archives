You need to get LoY to get the rest of them.  If you are missing more 
than one expansion then your best bet is the new package 
Everquest:Evolution.  There's another expansion coming out soon, Lost 
Dungeons of Norrath, that's not included with Evolution.
If you buy LoY, go to maps.eq-toolbox.com and download a zip file with 
all maps, will make it much easier on you.  Otherwise, you gotta make 
your own maps for each zone.
