Just turned level 24 and have all my new spells...
my old lineup was:

FD
Siphon Life
Allure of Death
Leach
Pet buff/heal/summon and Fear  (swap out often)
Darkness(which ever is my best)
Heart Flutter
Heat Blood


Now, I've gotten a few new spells, but I'm not entirely sure if I'm
even using my present spells to their best advantage.
Shock of Poison is one of my new DD spells but not sure if its better
to DOT rather than DD and usually when I need a DD I just life tap em.
Screaming Terror is another new one and I'm not quite sure how
usefully it would be for Solo... I see the benefits for grouping
(which does not happen often)

The spell list is what I use for Soloing, I of course use my personal
Buffs/Shields prior to going into battle.

Your comments are appreciated.
