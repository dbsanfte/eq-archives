    Do a /who all 60 on our server sometime. See all those level 60's in Vis
Maior, and Wraith, and Lotus Cult? They're enjoying "the endgame", where you
kill massive boss mobs. Key word, enjoying. To many, level 60 is freedom -
they finally get to be the slayers of great beasts they always wanted to be,
and they no longer have to worry about grinding XP endlessly.

    And just so you know, you're exactly the sort of person VI fears - get
level 60, and quit. ;-)
