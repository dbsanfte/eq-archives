Having played a ranger and a druid to the high 50's (ranger) and low 
50's (druid), I can unequivocally say the ranger has the best tracking
ability. :) (Druid tracking suxxors :P.)

>What level would I need to attain to get reliable results? 

 From what I remember (it's been a long time since I was a low level
ranger), your tracking is always reliable. The only thing that changes
as you get higher in tracking skill is the distance at which you can
track. So, if I have it correct, a tracking skill of 100 is as reliable
as a tracking skill of 200, it's just the skill of 200 lets you track
mobs that are further away.

>Having never had a tracker...will I see mob names and locations, or 
 >what will I see?

As a ranger, you have the option of sorting your tracking list. (Can't
remember if this is true at skill level 1 or not though.) When you
hit your Tracking button, you will see a window that has a list of
the mobs within your tracking distance. You can sort them by the
latest mobs to spawn <Normal> or by how close they are to you <Distance>
and maybe a third one but I have used it so rarely that I can't remember
what it is or even if there is a third one. :P You can also modify
your list so that you don't see certain cons <i.e., doesn't show the
green mobs.> You can also filter out player characters but I don't do
that either so not sure if it's PCs and NPCs or just one of them.

What you will see (depending on the way you choose to sort your list)
is a list of mobs names sorted by either distance from you or by how
long ago they spawned. No locations. When you highlight a mob and hit
the Track button, you will start getting messages. Gorenair is straight
ahead. Gorenaire is ahead and to the left. Gorenaire is behind you.
Gorenair is RIGHT HE...Loading, please wait. <Sorry, not that last one.>

>Where in DL would you recommend that I park this tracker?

I would think that even a level 1 ranger could track Gorenaire from
the druid spires, but I don't *really* know. When my 59 ranger has
gotten ported in in the past, she's always been able to find him on
track if he's up. OTOH, when my 51 druid ports in, she has to run
closer to the tunnel to see if she's up and sometimes even then she
can't see him/her because Gore has wandered too far out of her tracking
range.
