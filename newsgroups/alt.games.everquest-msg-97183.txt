Specifically, here is what Im wondering... I have a character who is
currently level 35.  He is one and a half bubbles in.  When the patch comes
down, will the exp he has gained at level 35 be multiplied out by something,
and when I log on he will be further into the level?  Or will he still be
where he was as far as bubbles, but any NEW exp he gets will be more
valuable at 35?  Just kinda wondering if I should play him again before
Tuesday or just work on an alt....
