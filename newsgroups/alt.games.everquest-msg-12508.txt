I haven't, nor would I ever, give to a begger. 

I frequently offload my ill-gotten gains on people actually working for
themselves. When I'm after bone chips for Cabilis faction, I'll offer
5pp - way above base value. I'll throw in a little extra too. If someone
says, 'How about 6pp a stack?' I refuse to buy from them at any price. A
bandage or two can go a long way on a young player, as can a taunt or
two on a train. Cougar claw earrings are a nice gift since the vendors
sell them for peanuts and it's something to collect during the ong
Stormfeather camps.

There are plenty of ways to help though less fortunate/advanced but if
you beg for free stuff, you'll never see a penny from me ):o)



One tip: L60 characters don't usually carry around bronze armor to sell
):oP
