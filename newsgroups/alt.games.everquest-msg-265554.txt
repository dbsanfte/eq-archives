After a period of time in which the original player had not been engaged 
with the mob, they would regen to full health, forget the original 
player, and be available.

In EQ if a player zones they forget instantly and usually regen to full 
within a few moments. It doesn't have to be -that- fast (and indeed 
there are problems with it being so instant) but it wouldn't kill usage 
of the area for more than a minute or two.
