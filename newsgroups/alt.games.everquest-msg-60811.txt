 I tried it too. Seemed to me that my clipping was turned ALL the way 
down in all zones. I couldn't see very far at all. Colors were screwed
up on some MOBs and objects popped in and out of sight randomly. 
 
 Using a V5 with DX8.1 and latest graphics drivers. I didn't like it 
at all. The big DX7 "upgrade" screwed up my sound big time and it's 
never been fixed yet. I don't like it when they do this to us. All 
for the character models I think look extremely awful in the first 
place.
