1)  You can try Lake Rathe til about level 21, then South Karana. 
Also, Lake of Ill Omen is very nice from 20 to 27 or so.
2)  As a ranger, definitely keep your archery up.  At 51+, you get
double damage on non rooted. non moving MOBs (I believe it's non
rooted non moving, but I could be wrong).  Also, at level 55, you get
a discipline that massively increases your bow damage for 2 minutes. 
I've seen logs with rangers doing 15,000 damage in bows alone for that
2 minutes.  twing twing twing...  To get to 200 in archery, it took me
many hundreds of arrows to get one skill up.  Nice to have a long
range bow (aka Raincaller) and a mage to summon arrows...  Also, try
and get someone practicing tailoring to make you a quiver.  The quiver
adds a haste to your bow, which I believe is 22%.  Much later comes
the fleeting quiver, 40%ish haste (don't quote me on the haste
percent).  I have two HQ lion pelts (not HQ cat) waiting for attempts
at it once my RL tailoring friend is higher.  He's at 135 and working
his way up.
3)  Icetooth Claws, without a doubt.  11/29 primary only.  They are
around 100 - 150 on the Saryrn Server.  I DESPISE the ebony bladed
sword.  Never used one, never will.  Ensnaring roots?  Heck, I don't
even use the spell with my druid.  Imagine this scenario:  your group
has just gotten a mob to turn tail and run, you have him snared, when
your EBS procs, thus rooting him (and overwriting your snare, so when
ensnaring roots drops, no snare is left), so he turns and attacks your
group...  Now also imagine that your group has just finished off
multiple mobs and is low on health.  Your group won't like you very
much at this point.  I'm much rather have a Crystal Fiber (8/26, no
procs,50pp ish), Wraithbone hammer (8/26 +5STR, +2WIS/INT 200 -
300pp), PGT (6/26 beserkers strength 30pp), Silvery War Axe (6/22
30pp) SSOM (6/22 +3STR/AGI I believe, no drop I think?), etc etc etc.

I am on the Saryrn Server, so if you are on Saryrn and need an offhand
weapon, I can give you a SWA or maybe even a Crystal Fiber.
