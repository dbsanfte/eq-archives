No sir.  Words and rituals have no inherent magical powers.  The
purpose to which they are directed is their sole purpose (I am
referring only to intent here).

Hmmmm, yes, I put that very poorly, thank you for pointing it out.
It would be more correct to say that "the actual connection to any
person's spirit can only occur within that person."  In the religious
tradition I participate in, accepted doctrine is that only God can
accomplish the connection.  Free will does apply btw, you are not
prevented from rejecting God.
