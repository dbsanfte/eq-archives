Excactly how long does it take you to regain the xp from an unrezzed 
death at level 20?  My experience has been one, yes one, kill in Paludal 
Caverns.  I ate multiple deaths with various characters through the teens 
and low 20s, and the penalty is a joke.  I have eaten several unrezzed 
deaths at level 65, and the penalty is much more noticable.  Certainly, 
most of my deaths at high levels have been rezzed at 90% or higher, which 
makes them almost meaningless, but, then, unrezzed death at 20 was 
meaningless too.
