Neither of which actually work in this case, though, because it's not
actually a popup.  The page that was linked to is dynamically generated, and
under the right (or wrong, depending on your point of view) circumstances,
rather than giving you the story, gives you a page with an ad, and a small
link to take you to the story.  (I believe it will take you to the story
after the Flash ad finishes, too).
