My system has a celeron processor (500mhz, I think?), 512mb ram,
soundblaster live and a voodoo3 pci video card. Anyway, in response to
my conversation with tech support at verant who indicated that they
really didn't think my card was going to work after monday's patch
(although they say they're working on it), I rather unhappily ran out
last night and bought a new geforce2 64mb pci card to replace the voodoo
(/em blows a raspberry at verant - I freaking *hate* upgrading video
hardware, both the cost and the fact that there *always* seem to be
complications.) Anyway, tried to install the damn thing this morning, in
the same slot the voodoo came out of, and I am getting no video beep
code from my motherboard now. I am quite sure the thing is seated all
the way and that the monitor cable is attached tightly. It didn't come
with any instructions as to what to try if plug n play failed, so I'm
kind of stuck. Does anyone see an obvious incompatibility here that I'm
missing, or have another suggestion as to what I can try?  Or should I
jump to the conclusion I have a bad card and return it for another one
(or a different model maybe)? BTW, I dropped the voodoo back in so I
could log in and ask this.  It still works fine in that spot.
ARRRGGGGHHHH! Nothing like being forced to fix something that wasn't
broken in the first place. =(
