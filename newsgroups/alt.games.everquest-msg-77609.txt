Well, if I were a role-player, I'd go with the "Dwarves love underground, 
blah blah blah" stuff.  But, I'm not.

The group in is a GREAT group.  We are a non-stop killing machine that 
works so well together, I'm still waiting for Verant to nerf us somehow.  
We like the EXP bonus of dungeons and the fact that a lot of people are 
scared of them.  When we go into Kaesora each night, we are the only ones 
there, except for a high level guy who may pop in now and then for the Mage 
epic or to get the Fang.  No worries about camps - we just go wherever we 
want.

I'm getting about 4 yellows a night, and that is not bad.  Now that 5 out 
of 6 of us are level 40, I'm sure it will slow down a little.

We like exploring places we have never been and "leaving our mark" =)  
Anyone can go to DL and get real good EXP.  We don't want to be "anyone", 
we want to go where others don't.  Any ideas for when Kaesora's EXP gets 
too slow are welcome.

With the bard tracking, we can figure out if any named are up and clear a 
path to them and take them down.  We didn't get the Bard sword last night, 
though - the spider didn't drop it.

We love the challenge of breaking into the dungeon and getting to where we 
want to be, then breaking out again when we are done for the night.

We also like the drops that we have been getting.  Our Shaman got his 
frenzied tail last night ( after being LD for the others ones we looted ).  
We picked up a Dagger of Frost last night.  A Tombcarver also dropped last 
night.  We also have 4-5 of the +6 int +6 wis books that the Librarians 
drop, along with a few armor upgrades for our Bard and even Drag, who 
replaced his BS Mantle with one that had 1 more AC.  All 6 of us now have 
the 25% weight reducing pack ( sad it only holds Medium sized items ).

The cleric has her 55 Druid parked outside and makes bank runs for us when 
we get too laden with coins and weapons ( every night ).  It's just a total 
blast in there.

I think the silence and ambiance of a forgotten crypt or an underground 
tomb are also a draw.  I can leave all my channels on, and hear the rare 
person pop in and ask for directions to a_named_mob01 without having to 
hear the constant drivel that the kids spout off in /ooc and /shout in the 
populated zones.

Maybe, we are just wierd.
