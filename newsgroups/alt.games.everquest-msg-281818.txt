Or maybe it's because EQ world is several times larger than the state
of Rhode Island, something like 1/3rd the size of Connicut.  No other
online game world is this big.

Or maybe because there's plenety of things to do?  There's always a
demand for celestial essence, something a level 1 could make in large
quanity with time.

Or maybe because EQ isn't full of pimply faced teen who talks like
they are using text messenger or worse 1337 talk, and always start a
verbal war (ie PS3 is 1337!  No XBox 360 is better! etc).
