This sunday, looked to be a pretty yawn raid day but as raid time approached
and folks logged in a report came back that Rallos was up in Tactics.  We've
been working on him for awhile now and our previous best attempt we got him
good and it's very very close but...raid wipes at Rallos down to like 4%.
If one of our charm pets hadn't broken on pull he prolly would ahve died
then.

We wait for the GY and rez and buff up to try again.  1 Cleric has
to leave and a wizard, and a bard.  But, as we are clearing up to Fake RZ
again 2 more cleric and anotehr chanter log in.  This is good, Rallos is 
gonna be doomed.  Sure enough we have the healing down pat on the MT,
all charm pets are just beating the crap outta Rallos and it's 90..80...70
....10...5...1...DEAD what a rush!  of course we now have a huge hoard of 
add critters getting trained about the pit and most of the raid dies at that
point. :)  We have to send in a sacrificial ranger to train the mob clot 
away from the projection and away from Rallos carcass.  But so what, we got
about 15 folks EP enabled and the bulk of the rest of the raid crew missing
just VZ to get in.  Which is a bit annoying since VZ is a 1 groupable Mob and
is nearly always insta-ganked on spawn.  But we will get the rest of our folks
in eventually.  Loot on RZ was like his earring and his boots, which were 
very appreciated by the BL and ENC that recieved them.

After RZ down we go off and Kill Shei in AR for giggles.  He's an annoying 
fight but is killed pretty handily nevertheless.  Folks need to log and we
are left mostly with the 14 folks who are EP enabled so we decide to go off
and explore the Plane of Water.  Unlike what seems to be the vast majority
of folks in the serverwide.age channel the guild I'm in and folks we do
stuff with lived in Kedge pre-Kunark and spent tons of time in Siren's
during the Velious era.  We _know_ how to swim and really given the horrid
push our raids tend to generate being in water makes no noticable difference
to us.  So we go poking about killing things and manage to spawn Hydrotha.
We've done good so far, no deaths, a few red cons killed and only having
1 cleric, 1 druid, 1 shaman for healing.  Having 2 very on teh ball enchaters
does help but really we dont' get many multiple pulls.  Back to Hydrotha, 
we are there, he's up, so like any right minded band of lunatics we go ahead
and pull him. :)  It's over quick heh, just not enough dps and healing to
keep up and his blind is really irritating.  But we were proud to get him
to 90% before the wipe!  Once we get a few more folks EP enabled we think
he will die fairly handily.  While we wait on teh GY our rangers report
that the Ferocious Barracuda has spawned so we figure after rezzing up
lets kill at least 1 named in this zone.  Was a really easy fight actually
and got a rune and some coral chuck that we had to force our enchanters to
loot.

All in all a very very good day for a mixed crew represented by 5 guilds
and rarely by more than 50 folks.  RZ died with 49 if I remember correctly.
Plus, we are in many ways the definition of casual. :)  One day a week raiding 
and we often do things the Creme de la creme would never do! For which I
get teased mericlessly in channel!

Was fun. very fun and see ya'll in the Planes!
