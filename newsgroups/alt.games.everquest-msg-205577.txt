They will, but if you need a stopgap measure, I found out the other day you
can buy a 'MasterCard' which you pre pay in cash however much you want to be
able to charge on it, then use (there may be an additional fee, but the
person told me there wasn't). I forget where he said he got it. (Like
WalMart or somewhere like that) He uses it for all his online purchases, as
additional security (someone gets his number, he only gets ripped the
balance on the card).

Since you prepay in cash there's no credit issues.
