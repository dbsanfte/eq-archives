I had a similar experience while playing EQ and looking out my second story
window
in the late afternoon/early evening.  The sky was a nice uniform shade of
blue and the trees stood out
against it very nicely and the moon was rising above them (not totally full
but close enough)
and I noticed how nice it was and how much it looked like the game and then
I realized that I hadn't been outside all weekend long..... (the Karanas
don't count I guess,
although they "feel" like being outside... hahaha).
