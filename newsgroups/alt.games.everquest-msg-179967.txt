I think you're misspelling your name. It ends in "yr," not "in." [1]

Try my attitude on for size. I think it suits better.

I give play-by-plays during uberfights and describe the gear I get in
the age and eqtraders channels because I have come to the conclusion
that there is some core constituency on each that genuinely wants to
see the others do well in their EQ endeavors. I don't do it to show
anyone up. If it makes you bitter and envious, fuck you, you fucking
fuck.

[1] I suspect your hackles are up to high to take this in the spirit
of which it is intended. Trust me. It's funny.
