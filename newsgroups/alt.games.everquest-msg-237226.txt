Thanks.  I don't generally have time to spend on the Forums (there's
plenty of volume here on a.g.e for my tastes :-), so I didn't see the
discussion there.  I *did* try looking at the front page of
eqlive.station.sony.com, and read the headlines and "developers
corner" and other stuff, and didn't see any mention of container bugs,
nor indeed any other list of known "hot" bugs.  (I see in the Forums
that someone has asked for such a list.  I'm not holding my breath!)

As I mentioned in my OP, I did get a fairly prompt response (a few
hours, perhaps) when I /petitioned about the broken quest container.
No relief, but a GM did talk to me about it.  On the other hand, the
GM didn't seem to know about this "known bug". :-)  Maybe even if SOE
won't tell the players "here's a list of major bugs that we know about
and are actively working on", they should at least make sure the GMs
have such a list for when they get /petitioned about the bugs!

Hm, let's see, so I can't make progress on my major quest series
because of the bug.  Maybe I'll take some time off to train up my
tradeskills -- no, those require containers too.  Maybe run my alt?
No, she's trying to do some quests that involve containers also, so
why work on them only to find that those containers maybe are broken
also...  Yikes, I may have to get a life! :-)
