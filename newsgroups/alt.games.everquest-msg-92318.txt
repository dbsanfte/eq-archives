<Shrug> Read my follow ups. Maybe you'll understand my nature.

I guess you have to take into consideration that you deal with death.
Something that is not a pleasent thing for many. When someone dies, they're
naturally upset about it... you (as a Cleric/Paladin, and in extremely rare
cases Necromancer) simply deal with their frustration.

I'm a Shadow Knight. A non-twink, first character Shadow Knight... the most
I've ever at once is 500 pp. The sad thing: I'm 41 (been playing a year,
too...) with a full suit of Darkforge that I busted my ass for and a Mithril
Two Hander. I'm not a farmer... I have no income except from what I kill. So
bluntly, I find it pretty hard to pity others. An act of kindness (rezzing,
porting, etc, without asking me for anything in return) -will- get payment.
People that actually give a damn about others are rare, as I've only
actually seen a few. I'm practically a hobo, but I try my best reimburse the
people that help me.

Is it really that hard to say 'no'?
