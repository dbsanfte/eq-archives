}>}Then learn why Waite made it yellow, instead of

}>The easy way to do that would be if you just -told- me.
}Bah!... you young people of today...

Well, honestly, I didnt really know where to start looking.  I translated 
your answer as "go to atavista and search on +kether +binah, and that 
seems to be a start. :)

}Qabalistically, In the GD sytem of correspondences
}of the paths on the Tree of Life the path of the
}Magician (Beth) is number 11. This path connects
}Kether to Binah and is coloured yellow.
}The problem with re-colouring the card is that the
}path of the Fool on the Tree, is coloured a
}different shade of yellow. 

Well... But I found this site: http://www.rayonyx.westhost.com/KBL.html

They seem to associate path 11 with the fool, and path 12 with the 
Magician, and they're noticeably different shades of yellow.  What's up 
with that?

Just going by the colors in that nice picture of the Tree, though, it's 
the color of Tiphereth that really makes my eyes water most.  And of 
course, it's associated wih beauty.  Oh, the irony... :)

Conversely, Chesed is such a -pretty- blue...

}Astrologically, the Magician is assigned to
}Mercury (Hermes, Thoth), and under certain
}circumstances too complex to go into here,
}corresponds to the colour yellow.
}Alchemically, Mercury as the morning star is the
}Light Bringer, bringing light (wisdom), from the
}Sun.

I'll just admit to being fairly photosensitive, here. :) Perhaps this is
why I suck at playing wis casters. :)  Maybe I'll be able to root-dot more 
efficiently if I open the blinds...

}As Waite says in his description of the card
}he says of the Magician "having the countenance of
}divine Apollo". This light is the yellow sky and
}ground in the card.

Err... Apollo?  Thought we were on Hermes, here...  Is it a case of 'well, 
both, really'?

}>Hmm.  I thought I remembered that being a not especially pretty one, but 
}>wasn't sure, so I poked around on the web looking for it.  It looks like 
}>there might be 2-3 different Golden Dawn decks?
}The cards are described, but not pictured, in Book
}T, in Israel Regardie's enormous book, The Golden
}Dawn. I have never seen an original set.

Bah, my  copy of that book is unfortunately 3K miles away right now. :)

}The one I was referring to was created by Robert
}Wang, purely from the descriptions in Book T, I
}believe.

I -think- that's the one I didn't like very much aesthetically, but it 
seemed to have a huge amount of helpful information packed onto every 
card.  I could still be confusing it with some other, though.

}>Eh, they can have all the content in the world, and it won't help a bit if 
}>you never feel like picking them up and playing with them.
}The Tarot doesn't demand that you pick it up. If
}someone doesn't like the look of it, perhaps they
}had best leave it alone.

Well, true, but given a choice between a deck that inspires me to pick it 
up and the contrary, the choice seems obvious. :)

}I do remember hearing that that deck [URW] was a way of
}getting around some copyright problems, but I am
}not sure if it is true or not.

I vaguely remember hearing that myself once.  And if -two- people heard 
it, it must be true, right? :)
