I am aware of the SBlive!/EQ music bug. What I'm asking is if anyone has or
knows how to get liveware 3.0's full functionality back in windows XP. My
new PC came with a built in audio card that I could not stand. I put my
SBLive! in but I have not tried to install any of the software that came
with it because I did that on my old PC when I upgraded to XP Pro but the
livewire bar on the top of the screen flickered like mad and the software
did not really work.

Any Ideas?
