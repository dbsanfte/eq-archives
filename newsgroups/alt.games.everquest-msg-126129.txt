Youch.  How'd they get so low?  I still see them going for 100pp on EM.  
(Actually I should say I see them *trying* to sell for 100 plat, but 
since I never see any repeated /auctions....)  That's why I was 
wondering if the littler ones might go if they're only around 2 plat or 
whatever.  100 plat is a *lot* for a young player.  I'm just wondering 
whether there are any of those left out there *g*
