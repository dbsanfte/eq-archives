I'd have to disagree about PLing.  Of the three classes mentioned, only the
shaman is a great PLer (shaman vs druid for top spot will always be hotly
debated).  The other two classes are really nice for buffs which help in
PLing but HP & haste buffs aren't enough.

As for making plat; yes, there are enchanter whores who spread their legs
for anyone, but most of my fellow level 60+ enchanters don't (or not with
any regularity).  When people pay a lousy 10p there's not much incentive to
make a business out of selling KEI (though the whores apparently don't
mind).

Anyway, yes, you hit the nail on the head in the "needed" category.  In POP
tier 2 (BOT, HOH) there are very few instances where you don't need at least
one of the three classes and preferably 2 (any two).  For raids you need all
3.
