The relevance they have is that one is quite similar to another.  By 
pointing out a similar usage of another term, I had hoped to help you pull 
your head out of your ass (meaning your hindparts, not out of your mule). 
But, instead you decided to pull your little word game and assign me an 
argument that I didn't make.  You're not impressing anyone with your display 
of ignorance.
