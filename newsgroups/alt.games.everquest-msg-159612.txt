I would go to Erud's Crossing or West Commons, and kill Wisps.  To start with
you'll need some sort of magic weapon, but it needn't be a fantastic one if you
are level 11, get a mage to summon something for you, thats usually cheap enough
if not free.

Turn the lightstones and greater lightstones you get in to one of the three
quest people (gypsy in NK, Oasis, or SRo... Oasis would be the easy one) for
substantial exp but more importantly, a book you sell back for around 8pp.  Make
sure you have an open inventory slot for the book, but you just sell it right
back to her before handing in the next book.

At any rate, my point here is that you can get a substantial amount of cash
together fairly quickly doing this.  Now go to the Bazaar, and shop for
bargains.  You'll be amazed at how good the gear is that you can pick up for 5pp
or 10pp a shot, just because people are now able to fill up their vendors with
up to 80 items and don't have to work at all to offer them for sale.

I'd put about half your cash into a weapon, and keep an eye out for +HP gear for
any of your other slots.
