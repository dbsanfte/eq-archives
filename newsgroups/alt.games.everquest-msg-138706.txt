I have EverQuest on my E-Machines computer because my newer computer doesn't
let me play it. So I tried to reinstall it on my other computer where it did
work, but with these newer expansions I needed a newer version of DirectX. I
downloaded the lasted, 8.1, and after installation and rebooting I tried to
run EQ but it said I had no known 3D Device. I e-mail the EverQuest tech
support and they told me to run the 2 tests for DirectX I did and the
direct3d test failed so they told me to download all of my updates for
DirectX and for the my video and sound cards, I did but the game still says
I have no 3D device, what do I do? Please help, I really want to play this
game again. =(
