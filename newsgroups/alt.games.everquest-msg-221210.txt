Being an AA has a few important advantages.   One that it restricts the
content to the highest levels, where the problem actually is.   Until you
hit PoP, the knight advantages really don't mean all that much.  It also
makes it much easier to sell to Sony, following what they themselves did in
fixing the caster imbalances.

Wouldn't change anything, unless caster mobs were buffed way beyond what
they are now.   As is, caster mobs are a complete joke, unless they're
casting complete heal on themselves, or sunstrike on you.   And of the two,
CH is the much bigger threat, sunstrike is just a blip, a slight damage
spike above thier melee.

Also would also have to make everything unstunnable, otherwise paladins,
with thier multiple fast-casting-spell-interrupting stuns would gain yet
another advantage over the other tanks.
