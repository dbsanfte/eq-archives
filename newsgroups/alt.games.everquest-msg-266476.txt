 ahhh....memories :-)   I started working at the State of Illinois in
 1979 as a junior programmer (right out of college), and we used PLATO
 terminals for our telecommunications billing. I got hooked on Avatar
 (also called Avathar at one time), and ended up writing my own
 Avatar-like game in 1980 called "Journey".

 It seems like a lifetime ago ... but I guess it almost was!  :-)
