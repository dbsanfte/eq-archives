At first I wasn't going to post this; however, I don't think there is
enough profit in it for most players, so I'm not going to be hurting
profit-wise because of it.  

Yesterday, I decided to up my brewing skill.  So I ended up spending
around 30 to 40pp getting it up to 125.  I got to thinking about it, a
lot of players might want to work on tailoring, but not take the time to
work on brewing as well, so I took 15 minutes and made 10 stacks of
Heady Kiolas and headed off to the bazaar.  When I got there, I was
surprised by the outrageous price of tradeskill supplies.  (I can't
fathom spending 100pp for a stack of spider silk.)  The only heady
kiolas in the whole place were being sold for 10pp a piece.  Well, I
though about how much a stack cost me.  (5.2pp for kiola sap,
1.something gp for a stack of water and about the same for bottles.) 
Now, I didn't want to lose money on this, but I figured making approx.
10pp a stack would be pretty good.  So I set my price at 7gp 5sp each. 
When I got back this morning, almost all of the stacks were sold and
looking through my log, I had a nice tell from one person who bought
them from me, thanking me for making them so affordable.  So I think I'm
going to do this occasionally maybe with metal bits as well, it makes me
a little bit of money and it makes people happy.  I'm not expecting
everyone to do this every night or anything like that, but every once in
a while do this and make a tradeskiller happy.
