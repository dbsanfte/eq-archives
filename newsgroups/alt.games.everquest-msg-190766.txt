I put off dinging lvl 61 for a long time as I built up AA points.  After
earning 8 AA Training points (spent on  Run3, Innate Regen3, and Mental
Clarity 1 ) I got bored and dinged 61.  Now in all the places I am
accustomed to hunting solo the former DB mobs are Light Blue (= minimal
xp!).

I have soloed in PoN a bit, but when the zone is crowded (most of the time)
it is very tough to do.  I am looking for any strategies, soloing spots, or
grouping areas that a 61 druid can get resonable xp.

Thanks for any experience you can share!
