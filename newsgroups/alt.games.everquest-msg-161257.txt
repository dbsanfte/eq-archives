Heh bull . If you cared anything at all about official results then the
first count right after the election in florida done by computers would
count. The fact that democrats could even try and claim that partisan
democrats could count votes by hand better than a mechanical machine was so
ludicrous as to be laughable. They tried to claim this for a month and had
to have our supreme court tell them to BEHAVE damnit , and to do so twice !

Also sanijan is correct in that provisional , and absentee votes are
generally not counted if such votes cannot swing the result. He is also
correct in that the majority of all absentee and provisional votes are for
republicans . It is not at all clear the gore got more overall votes, though
it is clear that even if he did it would not matter in our republic.
