Do grey con mobs drop chests? I know they don't give any xp (which I
also think is gay) and they do give body loot like clumps of hair, bat
ears, reptile meat that I can sell for a whopping 6 copper.

Reason I'm asking is to find out whether it's worth killing grey named
mobs. I avoid grouping whenever possible, so I've missed out on
killing a lot of named mobs while they were still green to me. In
other words, if they don't drop chests, I have zero chance of getting
the rare drops that only nameds drop, since it's impossible to solo
95% of the bosses when they're still green (at least for my summoner).

If not (and I'm thinking they don't drop), it would probably just be
another reason for me to quit. I'm already getting annoyed with the
ridiculous amount of controls that EQ2 puts on play style. Such a
shame too.. So much potential :(
