It is good to hear that SoE did finally come through on this.  I do 
vaguely recall hearing about this quest NPC, as I recall, it was aimed 
more at wizards where the faction was completely hosed for their epic for 
a while.  Ask Jazz about that story I believe.

It really sucks when you get a clueless idiot to answer your petition 
initially, but, at least it was finally resolved.
