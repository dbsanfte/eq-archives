Out of curiousity, does anybody know if/how this experience splitting affects
faction? To be specific, let's say my 7th lvl Wiz is grouped with a 9th Cleric
and a 9th Warrior and we kill a bunch of gnolls.  I know I'll get less xp per
kill than them, but do we all get an equal bump in faction per kill? Or is that
somehow divvied up too?
Thanks.
