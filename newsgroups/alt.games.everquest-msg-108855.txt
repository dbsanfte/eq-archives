How seriously am I supposed to take the idea of murder when all I'm
really doing is sending a critter back to its bind point after a fixed
amount of time? How would I apply real-world morality to a system
where I'm seeking revenge on Trakanon because "he's killed me more
often than I killed him?"

Would the system be more moral if I could create a "slave" character
whose only purpose in existence were to make thousands of thousands of
fish rolls so that I can buy the gear I need to go out and kill?
