How many times no?  Damage output increases because
attacks speed increases.  PERIOD.  THE END.  The other
way is to calculate the delay reduction - less common
because it's a smaller number.  It does not increase
the chance of a hit, or the damage per hit, but the
swings per minute.  BO3 is a mage pet buff with 60%
haste.  I can easily see the difference in how often
my pet swings.  Thats because he usually swings 20
times per minute, and now he swings 32.
