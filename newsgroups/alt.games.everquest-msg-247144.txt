I wonder why they can't have the server select screen first, and then have a
login server per game server. This would only need read-only data for the
purpose of login - any account changes/new characters can be done on the
main server, but at least the majority of people who just want to log in and
play an existing character (probably 99%) can get in with none of the usual
frustrations.
