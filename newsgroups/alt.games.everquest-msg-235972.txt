Some people dont like the bouncy effect, and I swear, when I see
someone riding one, it looks like they are bull riding and will get
thrown off any second.

For the OP, be forewarned. The cheapest 9k horse is slower than even
the AA ability run speed 3 (which is itself slower than SOW). Also
with a horse you get its head in your view (which you dont get with
the drogmor). It can be a real pain to target things while on
horseback. Trying to loot a corpse can be an adventure in itself.
Also, you cant duck on horseback, so interrupting your own spells is a
real pain in the butt. You also consume food faster (you gotta feed
it) but thats a minor point. BUT - one of the nice things is that you
are always medding (unless in combat mode) and wont ever get sit
aggro.
