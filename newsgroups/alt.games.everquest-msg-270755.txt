: Can't find anything about a PoNb alternate access quest...any ideas?

I don't think any such quest exists.  IIRC the alt entry quests for PoP in
the recent patch applied only to killing Elemental Gods allowing one to get
a drop which would allow access to that plane, or whacking Quarm while
15% in allowing access there.  Only way to PoNb is, I think, doing the 
Hedge.
