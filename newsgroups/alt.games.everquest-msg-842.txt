Camping in one area for a long time can be very boring. There is no prize
for getting to level 60, so there really is no point in trying to level as
fast as you can.

You might want to try exploring more, visiting some zones while you can
still feel the excitement that comes from knowing that a mis-step will kill
you. If you are currently in Highpass, try and convince the party you are in
to explore Runnyeye. Mention the new exp bonus for the zone, that should
help convince them. It is tough, but can be a lot of fun at your level. It
also has some nice items you can loot to wear or sell.

The Gorge of King Xorbb, Southern Karana and Najena are within walking
distance, you can probably find plenty to kill in those areas. The zones you
have been killing in have smaller mobs, maybe a trip to the Rathe Mountains
to kill some giant skeletons would be exciting, especially since you are a
Cleric with those nice undead Direct Damage spells. Also, Everfrost has some
nice big mammoths to hunt. These are outdoor zones in the true sense, the
mobs mostly wander so you have to hunt them or have someone pull. In the
zones you mentioned, even though they are mostly outdoors, the spawns hunted
tend to be static.

If you have some friends you normally hang out with, Kerra Ridge is great,
there are several quests and the mobs will mostly con blue at 24. I think it
also is getting an exp boost, and it's a nice zone, the only one I can think
of off hand where the vast majority of mobs are around the same levels.
There are no level 50 uber mobs waiting to whack you for turning a corner,
nor are there tons of low level healers making your kills much tougher. And
killing cat men is just fun.

Another thing you might want to look into is questing. It is a good way to
break up the monotony of exp camping. Do some research ahead of time on
where you would like to go, then check a site like
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/  to see if there are any interesting quests
that would be appropriate for your level. You should be looking into getting
some of that nice Clerical quest armour around your level.

I have personally hunted or explored 55 zones in the old world, and another
7 in Kunark. Of course I have been playing since August and I am only six
levels higher than you, so it is a trade off. The route you have taken is a
very common one, a variation being Lake Rathe and Southern Karana instead of
Highpass Hold and Highpass Keep.
