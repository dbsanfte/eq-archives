You are entirely missing what a BL buff can do.  A BL can buff his pet up in
level, at level 60, he can make his pet level 47.  A druid or shaman or
enchanter can toss all the buffs he wants at his level 6 pet, and that pet
will then be a tough level 6 mob when charm drops.  A BL can make that level
6 pet into a level 47 pet, and you will get xp for killing a level 47 mob
when you kill it after charm drops.
