There was a *serious* werewolf infestation in WC on Prexus last night,
with a number of named werewolves clearly run by GMs, and a stunning
number of greater werewolves running around - much more than in the
Halloween event.

And like all events, it would have been great if not for the other
players. I dunno, it seems like the sky turns red and the average IQ
of a zone gets cut in half.

These and several other amazingly dumb things shouted out over and
over and over...

"What are all these wherewolfs [sic] doing here?"
"Is there a GM event?"
"Why is the sky red?"
"Is the event over?"
"Where are the wolves?"
"Is anything good dropping"?
"Help!"

MMORPG games will continue to improve. Too bad the players apparently
won't.
