Try it pulling the heavy hitters in VP.  Maybe you can do it, I just know that 
our monks LOVE having an SK with instant invis pulling there.  For 95% of the 
pulls, a monk is as good or better.  In certain situations, especially when 
you need to pull, invis, and then navigate past other mobs, NOTHING beats an SK, 
not even a motivated necro.
