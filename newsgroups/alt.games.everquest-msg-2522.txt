I've never met an enchanter who actually WANTED to slow. Enchanter slows
suck, and enchanters lack both the AC and HP to survive doing it.
Enchanters have quite the full plate without having to worry about yet
ANOTHER duty. Especially one they aren't all that good at. Every time I've
joined a group, the enchanter (if present) has invariably said: THANK GOD I
DON'T HAVE TO SLOW ANYMORE...usually right after they finish looting their
recently ressurected body.
