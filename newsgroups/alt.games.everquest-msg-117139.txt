Don't feel bad...I've actually saved a ton of money by
not buying a single other computer game for 3 years.

I don't obsess over EQ, it's just that after 3 years
I'm STILL having a good time playing it, so when
work is done and the spouse/kid are in bed, and
I have time to just play a computer game, I play
EQ.

And solitaire.  But it's not exactly the same thing...
