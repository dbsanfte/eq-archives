> is it possible to con warmly in Freeport ???

Freeport has a load of factions/special interest groups. IMHO it is one of
the easier human cities to get around into and around in.

The problem is after killing a ton of Orcs in the commons to raise you
faction up with the guards and tradefolk, there are still other factions
around. For instance, there are bards in a few of the bars, rangers in inns,
etcetera, that you will still be KOS to.

I haven't done some of the quests like killing Lydl the Great because while
it may increase faction Arcane Scientist, it lowers faction with Opal
Darkbriar, the good mage and evil mage faction respectively. You will
probably always be KOS to the mages.

The necros under the city don't seem to like followers of Rallos Zek either.
