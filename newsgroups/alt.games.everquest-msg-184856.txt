I have seen some screenshots of EQOA.  One version is to take a picture 
of your TV, always turns out very bad.  Another way is beyond my 
capabilities, feed the signal to a computer instead of a TV or a VCR or 
something capable of capturing video somehow.  There was a video link 
going around during beta from some guy that had some kind of hookup to 
the net, showed everything on his screen, it was neat.  Until someone 
waved the NDA in his face and forced him to stop.

If I could give you screenies I would, there's some very pretty 
countryside in EQOA.
