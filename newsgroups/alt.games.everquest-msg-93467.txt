Is there a place where reported bugs are posted so that I can look to see if
the bug I run into has already been reported?  I hate to keep bugging the
debuggers with known bugs and I am sure they also hate getting bugged with
the same bugs.  But if it's a new bug and it's bugging me I need to report
the bug to the debuggers right away.  Know what I mean?

OK,  I know that's bad, I'm sorry.
