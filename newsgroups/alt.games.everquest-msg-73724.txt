But it is a class defining spell of sorts.  It only belongs to those classes
which are
primarily non-melee classes.  There is a good reason for this in quite a few
places,
which undoubtedly could be dealt with using different methods.  I'm not
defending
the current bind implementation, all I'm doing is pointing out why it might
not be
such a good idea for melee classes to have in it's current form.

I think anybody who's been playing for any length of time can recognize how
imbalancing it would be to be able to bind melee characters next to whatever
uber-critter they were fighting.  They come back with full HP when they die.
All they
need to do is loot a weapon to become very productive member of whatever
raid
they're participating in quite a bit of the time.

The same argument can be applied to casters, although not as effectively.
Casters
have to remem spells, a naked caster doesn't really have much mana to spend
on whatever critter is being taken down, and, let's face it, it takes much
less to
take a caster out again.

Is your cup half full or half empty?

If it is a disadvantage not to have bind, it is most certainly an advantage
to have
bind.  The only way to negate it's status as an advantage is to give it to
everyone.
