I felt like mucking around on it today, leveled up a tiny bit. Only 3
people in gfay!

Is it even possible to level something that doesn't solo too well on
Test? If its this low at primetime I can't imagine what off hours are
like.

/who all warrior 1 50

15 people. Including me, at L1.

 experience, as it allowed me to sit back and count the number of ways
 the Internet has corrupted me and exposed me to a world of stupidity
 and filth that I previously never knew existed."
