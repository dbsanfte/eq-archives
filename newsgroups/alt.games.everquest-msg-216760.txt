Dunno how things are on proddies but on test, with a far smaller
population, it tends to be absurdly easy to get 9s (and c5 and vallons
for that matter) from another group waiting to head out. With that
need removed cleric takes the lead again.

But I'd take either, whichever asks first. On test you quickly learn
not to say no to anyone unless they're a jerk. :-)
