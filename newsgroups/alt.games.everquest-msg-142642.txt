Because the epic snare is shorter duration and slower casting than our snare
spell, and the epic snare overwrites the spell.

The snare component makes the dot not stick on "immune to runspeed change"
mobs.

The snare component makes the epic effect VERY resistable.  Pure dots
(without debuff/snare/DD components) are near-lure in resistance rates.  I
can count the number of times my casted pure dot has been resisted by normal
mobs in the last 12 levels on one hand (this doesn't count the 100% mr mobs
or the 'must be in melee range' mobs resisting it), on the other hand, snare
does have a normalized resist rate, but it's 1.8 second casting time (albeit
with a 5 second refresh) and only 35 mana.
