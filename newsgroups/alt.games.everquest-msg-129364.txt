Oh, both can think of rational solutions.  Neither want to *choose*
rational solutions.

And this is the error of all these folk who want to blame the
US for their problems, or at least for not solving ther problems.  The
bottom line is that none of Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, etc. are
the 51st State.  The US cannot *impose* a solution on anybody without
doing to Palestine what it did to Afghanistan.  And, somehow, I don't
see the folk pissing and moaning about the US' lack of action standing
up and applauding were our B52s to start dropping bombs on the West
Bank and Jerusalem. 

When the Israelis and the Palestinians *want* to sit down and
generate a solution, then one will be generated.  They will not
want to do that until they are truly sick and tired of
killing each other and being killed.  Until that time, nothing
the US or anybody else can do, short of conquering and occupation,
will stop it.
