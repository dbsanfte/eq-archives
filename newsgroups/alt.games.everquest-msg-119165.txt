Yeah I haven't gotten it to work perfectly yet either.  But just a
point...the macro language makes no sense to non-coder-geeks...when there's
a pause in a macro, it's done AFTER the thing that it PRECEDES.  Sheesh.  So
if you want the pause after the /say, add the pause on the FIRST line BEFORE
the /say.
