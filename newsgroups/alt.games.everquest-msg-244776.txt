The language barrier is not what it used to be, Learning languages on
FV is no longer gimped.  Elvish is the de facto "common", learn that
and you get by just fine as most every toon over L20 seems to be
fluent in it.

Test has an interesting culture.  There is significant bias against
buffees from a number of the regulars, but it's not too hard to get
past it if you're capable of behaving reasonably (which I'd expect
to be pretty automatic for you from your posting history).
