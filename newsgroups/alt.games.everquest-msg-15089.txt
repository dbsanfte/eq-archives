Heh - my SK in Qeynos once spawned a Kliknic queen - but couldn't defeat 
it - so I worked up my own strategy.  I used harm touch, then kicked the 
shit out of her as much as possible, then let her kill me - then I ran 
*back* and harm touched her again - insta-death!  Sure, I lost a little 
exp, but at that level, not much, and it was so worth it for that feeling 
of "teach YOU to rip me a new one while I'm beating up baby gnolls!"  Of 
course, *first* I had to explain to the *other* level 3 guy who was there 
that it was a bad idea to try helping me, because in between my dying and 
coming back, he would realize he was gonna die and drag the queen back to 
the guards :( - but once he realized what I was doing he stood back and I 
had fun :)
