I don't think that having a bot healer counts as good gear in nearly
anyone's mind, as for equipment with a DS on it, that's even harder to find
than regen gear unless you're a class that already has a DS of some sort
(and your DS is usually better by the time you can click the equipment than
the DS on the equip), as for "ch" gear, I have no idea how charisma helps
tanks solo, if you mean complete heal, then other than donals BP (which you
can't use that often anyways) and soulfire (which only has 3 charges), there
isn't anything.
