Apparently a tougher one to learn is not to write off a potential 
customer on a first impression. If your goods/services are worth 
purchasing, that potential customer might be swayed. If you immediately 
dismiss them in the interests of "not taking any crap", then you don't 
afford yourself the chance of winning them over.

Regarding your initial rebuttal, you are also missing one other crucial 
point. *The customer is always right.* Say it with me now, *The customer 
is always right.* Whether in your mind they are or not. As such you 
cannot have equal footing in that relationship. You have to take some 
crap sometimes, especially when your marketing practices might offend 
certain demographics. You say, "I'm sorry you feel that way. I do hope 
you reconsider", and move on. Your profits compensate your for this one-
sided relationship.

These points not being observed, you can bet your huckster booty that you 
will not be well received here or in many other venues.
