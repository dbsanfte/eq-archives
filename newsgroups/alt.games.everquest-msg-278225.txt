I think most people leaving WoW are returning to their old games. CoH
had a big drop when EQ2 then WoW came out. Over the past few months,
the decline has not only stopped but reversed. They've recovered over
20k players that had been lost around the launch of these two games.
Perhaps some are going over to EQ2, but I'd wager a good portion are
going back to the games they were just playing to "hold them over"
until WoW and realized they actually enjoyed...
