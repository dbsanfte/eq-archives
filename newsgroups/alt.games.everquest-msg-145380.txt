When looking for information about the online game EverQuest, by Sony,
it's amazing what one can find by looking on Sony's EverQuest web site.
(I know, you're shocked.)

There's a full list of all the skills and how they work.

XP is XP. It's all the same. How much you accumulate will depend on what
percentage of your earned xp you funnel into AA. How fast the bar goes
up depends what level you are and what the levels are of the mobs you
are hunting, to a degree.  Essentially, you need the same amount of XP
as you would need to comlete most of level 51 to get one AA point.
