Fortunately for me (in an odd way) my machines won't run EQ2 well, and
the GF and I are saving for a place - which means no upgrades for a
while.  So, any temptation is easily resisted :)

I figure one of two things will happen - WoW wiil be a lot of fun, and
I'll stick with it for a long while

OR

WoW won't grab me and I'll crawl back to EQ because I NEED MY MMOG FIX!
(maybe I should seek psychiatric help instead)

I have to admit, if I were looking to play EQ2 at release, I'd be very
worried about such a major change to combat dynamics so close to
release.
