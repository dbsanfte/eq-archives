Yes. It is foremost in my mind everytime your name gets mentioned.

Correct. I weren't the one. 
Post them, Ronald. Right here. Demonstrate me going "apeshit" if you
will. I dare ya. I double dare ya!

Liar. Withholding information isn't the same as lying.

Liar. Fear wasn't mentioned.

Liar. My friends had full knowledge.

ROFL. That's your domain. I hang out in newsgroups to discuss and
debate. Remember those concepts?

Screaming? On usenet? Yeah right.

I *know* you have it, you moronic meringue! You've already posted it.

LOL! Oh please do... I'd love to see what response you get in the
christian newsgroup when you repeat your accusation that all I do
there is argue. I politely discuss topics relevant to the UK and to
christianity in the UK.

Now I know it is a hard concept, and I can almost hear the cogs
whirring from here... but not everyone is out for confrontation on
usenet. Startling concept, huh?

Also bear in mind, you fetid, flatulent flan-maker, that I know all
the newsgroups *you* post to on a regular basis. I can readily do
likewise to you. You have far more to lose than I. I am not ashamed of
my words, to you or anyone. I say nothing online that I wouldn't say
to the person's face.

Sure I'm interested. Psycho-analysis of fruitcakes is a part-time
hobby of mine.

>think it's a very sweet gesture that you seem so interested in me..

My interest in you was sparked off by your obsessive interest in me.
It is called tit for tat. Put quite simply (and I know you need it
doing):-

IF YOU CAN'T TAKE SHIT BEING THROWN AT YOU, DON'T THROW IT.

>it's almost kind of a homosexual kind of thing I guess. Perhaps you'd

/chuckle
In your dreams, old man.

>be interested in a .jpg of my ass, I'd gladly mail it to you. I've

You make an arse of yourself online on a daily basis. It is graphic
enough, thank you. Besides, I shouldn't think JPEG compression
algorithms could cope with *your* fat arse.

>never said anything on usenet that I tried to hide, so read away, it's

Again you repeat this ridiculous claim.

So you won't mind me posting these subject headings, taken from
alt.cracks (no, not that kind of crack, thankfully)....

REQ: Crack or reg# for the PALACE

Every single one went unanswered. I thought it amusing as all hell
that it took your 6th attempt before you even *thought* of saying
"please". Now, is Lokari-the-law-abiding taking note at her chum
Ronald's deliberate flouting of software piracy laws?

>your time if you want to spend it thrashing through about three months

Hey, you're the queen of off-topic. I wouldn't want to claim your
tiara.

>many people impressed with you already.

I don't seek other's approval. I seek to show a bullying arsehole and
self-proclaimed (corrupt) net-cop for the contemptible pile of manure
he is. (that's YOU, by the way, Ronald)

Never forget, Ronald... Feed your inner cactus
