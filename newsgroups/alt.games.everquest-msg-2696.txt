I installed EQ again and upgraded to SoV.  I reinstalled DirectX 7
from the SoV CD.  When I started EQ it only gives me the option of
using DirectX 6.  I downloaded DirectX 8 from the Microsoft website
and installed that hoping it would take care of the problem and the
same thing happens.  When I get my character into the game and press
F10 to change to full screen mode EQ crashes and exits.

Does anyone know what's going on or how I could fix it, short of
reformatting my HD and starting over.  I heard DirectX can't be
deleted and reinstalled.  Any help would be appreciated.
