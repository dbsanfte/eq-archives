You're NOT a healer if you slow a mob.  Sorry.  You need to pick up a
dictionary and read the meaning of the word.  You're a mob manager or
something, but your slowing of a mod doesn't heal your fighter.  Reduces how
much damage they take, but doesn't heal them one hit point.

Also the original post was about groups with BOTH a shammy and a cleric in
it.
