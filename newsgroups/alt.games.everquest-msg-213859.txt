Pets and Experience

As there's still some confusion about how experience works with the new pet
enhancements, I'd like to talk about it a bit more so that everyone
understands. Here are the basic rules, along with some examples -

Situation 1 - You are soloing and you have a summoned pet or a charmed pet
(not including Dire Charm)

  a.. If you do any damage to the monster at all, you get all of the
experience.
  b.. If you don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the
experience.
Situation 2 - You are in a group and you have a summoned pet or a charmed
pet (not including Dire Charm)

  a.. If you or your group do any damage to the monster at all, your group
gets all of the experience.
  b.. If you or your group don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets
75% of the experience.
Situation 3 - You are soloing and you have a Dire Charmed pet

  a.. If you do half of the damage to the monster or more, you get all of
the experience.
  b.. If you do less than half of the damage to the monster, the pet gets
between 25% and 50% of the experience, depending on how much damage it did.
  c.. If you don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the
experience.
Situation 4 - You are in a group and you have a Dire Charmed pet

  a.. If you or your group do half of the damage to the monster or more,
your group gets all of the experience.
  b.. If you or your group do less than half of the damage to the monster,
the pet gets between 25% and 50% of the experience, depending on how much
damage it did.
  c.. If you or your group don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets
75% of the experience.
How is this different than the old way for non-Dire Charmed pets?

In the old scheme, if a pet did more than half of the damage to a monster,
it took half the experience reward.

In the new scheme, pets take zero experience unless no player does damage.
If no player does any damage, then the pet takes 75% of the experience
reward. [Editors Note: This doesn't include damage done by you via a damage
shield but does include melee, DoT, or direct damage.  Only 1 point of
damage or more is required.]

This means that it's much easier to make sure a pet doesn't take any
experience from you or your group. In most situations where a pet would have
taken half the experience before, it now takes no experience at all.

How is this different than the old way for Dire Charmed pets?

In the old scheme, if a Dire Charmed pet did more than half of the damage to
a monster, it took half of the experience reward.

In the new scheme, if a Dire Charmed pet does more than half of the damage
to a monster, it takes 25% - 50% of the experience reward, depending on
damage done.

This means that things are about the same as they were for Dire Charmed pets
before, except they take less experience than they used to in most cases. As
long as your pet doesn't do a lot more damage than you, you'll get more
experience than you used to. In the worst case (unless you don't do any
damage at all), your pet will take half the experience just like it used to.

The one exception to this is - If you don't do any damage to the monster,
the pet gets 75% of the experience.

What's the bottom line?

With the new rules, players get more experience than they used to with a pet
in almost every situation. The only way you can get less than before is if
you or your group don't damage a monster. As long as you do any damage at
all, your pet will never take the 75% experience share. Make sure you do a
bit of damage, and your summoned or regular charmed pets won't take a single
point of experience.

For Dire charmed pets it's better also - If you do half the damage to a
monster, the Dire Charmed pet takes no experience. If you do less than half,
your pet takes as little as 25% of the experience when it used to always
take half. It can still take up to half the experience if you don't do much
damage, but if you're contributing to the damage you'll get more than you
used to.
