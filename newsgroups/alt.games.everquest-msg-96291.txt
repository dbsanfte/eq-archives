Does the MR componant wear off when you break mez though?  I've never 
received a clear answer on that, and have always just assumed that it did.  
I guess I could duel a guildie, mez myself, and have him break it and 
check.  Of course I don't think I've ever gotten Pixie Strike to stick on 
me, unlike Song of Dawn which has self-mezzed at the most inopportune 
times.
