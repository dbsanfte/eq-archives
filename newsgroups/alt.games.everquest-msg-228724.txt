Waning Light Katar and Lesser something of Serenity or tranquilty.

The second is a 16/25 hth item that has the same graphic as the
Glowing orb of the stormwatcher.  Green sphere with particles.

WLK is 16/22 (actually I miswrote - it's .73).

I got the 2nd for 2k and the WLK for 8k.

previously we'd have been prepping for pulls in as little as half an
hour from assembly time.  What happened is that my RL buddy used to
lead more than half of the raids.  He gets things moving fast.  The
problem is he had a disagreement about future direction with our old
GL.  She had someone else start leading the raids.  He was organized
and they still ran well - except he couldn't handle criticism on the
board and made several recruits leave by his actions.  Then the GL
stepped down (the stresses she felt were mostly of her ownmaking IMO)
and her RL husband stepped up to the Guild leadership.  The RL then
left due to the criticism of his attitude and the current GL has people
trying to lead raids who shouldn't.  He won't put my buddy back in
charge because his wife disagreed with him.  In the meantime my buddy
sets up small morning raids (3 groups usually) and we take down many
targets that the full scheduled raid might do as well, but takes way
longer.

I love the small morning raids, we set up and move to a target as soon
as we have minimum forces.  Anyone logging on then is told to catch up
at the next target, instead of holding the raid for them.  We move fast
and fight at the limits of our ability.  Instead of saying no pets - 
they go looking for charmable mobs for the mages.  We took Icewind and
Chaoswind with as few as 13 people and no shaman to slow.
