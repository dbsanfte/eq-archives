Jesus, people!  I ask a simple question and you guys turn it into a flame
war.  Would I be out of line to ask Dark Tyger to shut his trap and everyone
else to leave him the f--- alone, so that someone will have time to read my
original post and maybe (if I'm not being unreasonable) to either answer my
question or go post your flame wars in a new post.  Oh, and if you do that,
make sure the subject is something like "--->>> FLAME WAR!  DON'T READ IF
YOU DON'T LIKE FLAMING!!!!!! <<<---" so the rest of us don't have to sit
through 20 worthless posts.
