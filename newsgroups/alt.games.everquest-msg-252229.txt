Legally speaking, you're so wrong it's hilarious.  "Tangible value" is a
given and proved by the initial payment of $3,000.  That would never even be
a question raised.  In fact, if the criminal tried to argue that there was
no tangible value, then obviously the $3,000 was a gift, which he obviously
had no right to take back.

You assume that they don't, a rather large assumption to make.  More
importantly, I know for a fact that Sony/EQ is fully capable of providing
the data that on the day before the "alleged" sale, account #1 had X, and
account #2 had Y, and that on the day after the "alleged" sale, account #1
had X-Z and account #2 had Y+Z.

Wire fraud.  Probably mail fraud.  Crimes is an understatement.  Federal
felonies is more apropos.
