Hi All

I haven't played EQ for a while, since before the holidays, and when I
went to park my lvl 70 in Shroud Form, I noticed quite a few Forms
were marked as "unlocked".  I've only unlocked the Evil Eye Psion, yet
all the aberrations were unlocked, as well as several more across the
other shroud types.  Most strange. I can't buy the Abilities for them,
as the Train button is blanked out, although I can buy the various
stat abilities.  Still, its nice to see what they look like  :)
Anyone else had this glitch?
