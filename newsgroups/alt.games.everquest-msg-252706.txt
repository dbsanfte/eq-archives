Judging from the rankings, it looks to be the same on Bristlebane. I
think I have around 15 wins in MMC, which doesn't get me into the top
4000 for that theme. I have about the same number in Guk and I'm
easily in the top 1000. Can't tell with the other 3 themes since I'm
over 30 wins in those.

I think you're right, for many it's the path of least resistance.
Since "everyone" wants to do BB, it must be the easiest! I think that
when LDoN first started, there where more undead mobs in MMC so the
clerics, paladins, necros wanted to go since it was easier for them to
handle. Not sure if they nerfed the number of undead there or if it
was just a mistaken impression but I don't see where MMC has more
undead on average than Guk or Mir.

Well, loot there is 'worse', I think, because everyone does BB so the
drops from there tend to be more common. Best drops (resale wise) that
I can think of come out of Tak and Mir, mainly because people know
certain items from there can be turned in for a lot of tribute points
so the price tends to stay high (face mask of frozen mana, Architect's
BP). 

Not sure which I'd consider the easiest theme, probably either Ruj or
Mir just based on the fact that it's what our pullers prefer to pull
when we do 65 hard adventures. Bard prefers to pull Ruj (lots of room
to maneuver and no doors), monk prefers to pull Mir (fewer casters).
Not sure how valid their reasons are but I don't guess it matters. 

Hardest theme seems to be Tak. Lots of annoying casters (including
druids that sow the other mobs), lots of doors where you might agro a
whole room just by opening one and and at least one layout where you
consistently seem to get 5+ mob pulls unless you have lull/FD. Tak is
about the only place I can remember wiping on a 65 normal and it
almost always starts with a sowed runner getting away during a big
pull. Usually it's something along the lines of "well, we could've
taken the first 8...." <g>.
