A monk is a damage dealer, not a damage sponge.  It's absurd to expect that
they can sit there and take the blows that a paladin does, unless we're
going to let a paladin do the damage that a monk does.

Of course, I'm still bitter that a monk two levels below me, with worse
gear, was out tanking me while fighting undead in Katta.  I eventually just
let him MT the things, since they were taking away less of his HP bar.
