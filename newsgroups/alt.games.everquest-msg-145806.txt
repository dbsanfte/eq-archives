OK, used the new spell extensively before the patch patch.

Love it.

With summoned hammer and yaulp my dex is 195... they
aren't kidding when they said that thing would proc a lot...
only they should have said a LOT.

But the really handy thing about it is that it has a very healthy
mana regen component to it.  Rumor has it about 10 per tic.

The buff kills itself when you sit, so it doesn't up your maximum
mana regen rate.  On the other hand, it cuts in half the mana
hit you took while standing before.  Cost is only 10 mana,
so thats not significant really.

I was using it while pulling, looking for mobs its easy, but
with a half sec cast time, even while dragging mob back to
kill spot it was a cinch to keep it up.  Noticably better
mana regen while doing that, so no more wasting time on
my buttocks.

Meleeing, too, I didn't feel the need to do my classic
sit/stand & swing/sit dance, since it really didn't cost me
much mana to just stand and deliver.

Even for a non melee, non puller cleric, this thing should
be a great bonus, for all those fights where you can't sit
for fear of CHeal plus Sit aggro.  Just stay on your feet
and keep YV up constantly, you'll hardly miss that cold
floor on your tailbone.

Stacks with BAOTR, or I'd never consider casting it.. but
since it does, I'm thinking its going to be on about 50% of
the rest of my life!
