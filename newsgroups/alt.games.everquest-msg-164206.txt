<snipped it all>

I don't ususally respond to these kind of post, but you deserved what
you got.  You are helping to keep a market alive that should not
exist.  With the advent of the bazaar, Verant has made it very easy to
create your own uber character, you just have to put in the time to
get the level, not to mention the education along the way of how to
handle that class/level.  You want to be level 60+ then you should
earn it.
