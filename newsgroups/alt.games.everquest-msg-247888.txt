This is a problem I've just started having myself since the login screen 
update. Clicking and alt/shift/R don't do the trick for me. The only 
thing that has worked is to shift focus (usually by forcing up the task 
mgr via ctrl/alt/del) to another window and click back into the eq 
window. Happens on char and server select screen. I'm using XP fwiw.

All of LFay and some of PC was underground last night, but at least 
we've got a prettier login window. :-)
