> What's a reactive heal?

All healers have a distinct type of heal that helps define their class. 
Shamans have Wards, Druids have Regens, and Clerics have Reactives. All 3 
healer archetypes also have instant heals, but these are apart from their 
class defining heals.

Reactive heals are like little health packages placed on a player that sit 
there and then trigger when the player takea damage. They are "reactive" to 
the damage taken, and act without intervention by the healer. So, when you 
see a tank take major damage but instantly heal, it's often because of the 
Cleric's reactives.
