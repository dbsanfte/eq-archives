Did you ask for help?  Cause I for one learned long ago in this game 
never to attack anyone's mob who isn't asking for help.  Not ever.  Easy 
to get accused of KSing, or attempting to, or to find out someone was 
trying to die or that they had a partner I didn' see or that they wanted 
to try their best...

/y is fast and easy to get off in almost any situation.  If you don't do 
at least that, I won't lift a finger to "help" when it might be 
misinterpreted.

You had two mobs on you?  Maybe said mage can barely kill one.  I'll 
tell you something as a mage: we are made of fine porceline.  Very 
little HP, no root, no snare, no mez; one add, just one, and we go out 
like a candle in the wind.  Hill Giants are heavy hitters to begin with, 
my pet might not be able to handle two even with my best efforts, and 
USING those best efforts can easily mean one on my pet and the other on 
me... with my death coming shortly after that.

Was he even at his keyboard?  Perhaps his cat just crapped in his shoe. 
  Perhaps he was watching a Tina Turner moment on I Love the Eighties. 
You don't have any idea where this guy's mind was, its entirely possible 
that he came up near you as a "safe spot" so he could go on a bio break, 
and is in for a nasty surprise when he comes back to the screen to find 
he died about 10 seconds after you went to the ground and the hills had 
to find something else to do with their time.

Its not fair to ask that people rescue you just because you want them 
to.  Sometimes they can't, sometimes they aren't aware of you, sometimes 
they just dont feel like it for roleplaying reasons... the world doesn't 
owe you a living.  As you admitted, you pulled something you couldn't 
handle. Would it have been nice if he'd rescued you?  Sure.  Honor those 
who do such selfless things for you... but don't curse those who fail to 
go out of their way to save you from yourself.

See, that was nice of him.  But he didn't have to, and you wouldn't have 
complained if he hadn't done it.

Your mage encounter is no better or worse than the 30 other healers in 
POK who didn't rush to heal you when you arrived.  WHy should they, 
other than just to be nice?  Well why should he rescue you, other than 
just to be nice?

Frustrating to think someone else could have helped you but didn't, but 
is really not his responsibility.
