Anyone ever try a scavenger hunt?  It's been mentioned for our guild to do
as a fun event to help us learn each other in a new guild but we seem to
have a lot of ideas bouncing around.  Has anyone tried this or could refer
to a guild site that mentions this?  Prefer nothing level specific or at
least a twosome or threesome with a variety of levels.  We thought about
teams of good vs. evil, or casters vs. melee types.

Any ideas would be appreciated.
