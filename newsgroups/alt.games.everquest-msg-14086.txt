*sigh*  ASSUMING that CQ DID continually have a cleric in a safe place
casting CH on himself to keep himself on top of the hate list it doesn't
take a genius to know it's an exploit if a level 51+ critter can't summon
them then do damage.

It doesn't take a genius to know that it's an exploit any time you have ZERO
possibility to be on a critter's hate list but never get hurt.

I'm not accusing Verant or CQ of anything.  The whole story bores me to
tears because we'll never find out the truth for sure.  What I'm saying is
that if Verant's accusation is true, then yeah, it's an extremely easy to
see exploit.
