To actually caculate DPS get a logfile parser like EQ companion.  For
back of the envelop stuff the modal (2*dmg+1+bonus)/(dly/10) is ok to
estimate DPS.  Delay is the rate at which the weapon will swing in units
of 10ths of seconds, i.e. dly 10 is 1 swing per second, delay 150 is one swing
ever 15 seconds.

As far as the capping goes that's only until you hit L20 or thereabouts, the
max damage is different and I don't recall that formula right offhand. :)
