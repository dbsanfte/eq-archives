This is a "feature" in everquest. When you hit a zoneline you're still
inside the zone for 1 second. In this second you can get killed or be put at
a ridiculous low health by mobs, DoT's or whatever.
Considering you die (or get very low) while to your perception you're safe
the game checks your health, or death-status, before you zone into the next
zone.

If it's too low or you're dead you get stripped of all buffs and placed at
the safespot in the new zone. Mostly to make sure you don't die simply
because the zoning was preventing you from taking actions.

It is a bit buggy because sometimes you keep your buffs, but otherwise
that's how it's supposed to work.
