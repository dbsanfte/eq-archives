Out of interest, if it had happened to anyone involved in this thread what
would you have done (I don't believe it actually happened at all but that's
another story)

Would you keep it and log quickly, once dropped that bag IS free game, GM's
will do nothing.
Would you hang around and wait to see if anyone /shouts about it? How long?
2mins? 2hours?
Would you shout that it was found and ask for knowledge of contents as
proof?
Would you wait online for as long as possible, then post to your servers
forum (and possibly here) that a bag was found, describe what was lost and
it'll be returned?

I'm sorry to say if I'd have found a bag of 12k worth of kit I would do the
last of the options.
If however it was more than that and valued at 100k and I could use it I may
not be quiet so eager to find the original owner.
