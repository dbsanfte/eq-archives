> Any advice would be much appreciated.

Get a port from a druid to emerald jungle. The port in spot is very close to
the field of bone zoneline but the zoneline is hidden .

after port turn towards wall .keeping wall on your left side run for 20
seconds straight .turn left and climb up wall . It is a sheer wall and you
will have to spend another 20 seconds just climbing the wall , if you are
making any progress up keep going untill you hit the plateau. If you are
bumping your head then you didnt run far enough at the beginning and need to
go a bit further along wall before climbing it.

once you hit plateau  find where the new wall is at its beginning . Follow
that wall with it on your left . FOB zoneline is close and zones you over
right next to kaesora.

If you do this exactly right you will spend less than a minute in ej and be
in a section that has only sparse wandering mobs (no spawning points) . I
would feel comfortable moving a lvl one through here with sow but you may
want to find out how it all looks with your monk first .
