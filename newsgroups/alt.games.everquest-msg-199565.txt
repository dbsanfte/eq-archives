Well, assuming we can get my wife's graphic card problems ironed out 
(there's a lot of odd effects, but the name is the worst issue), we form 
a Vah Shir Beastlord/Warrior team. I am currently 12th level, and she's 
first, so levelling her up a bit is obviously step 1. The question then 
becomes...step 2.

That combo leaves us weak in the magic department, as she's a full tank 
and a beastlord is a half-tank. What are good places to go beyond 
Shadeweavers Thicket? (Or, for that matter, when is it safe to go to the 
'other half' of Shadewavers, the non-newbie zone?)

Any advice is appreciated.
