Great Question.  Guilds in Everquest really become almost a must have.
But alot of them are a "Should a never been".

Finding a good Guild..  As you go from level 1 to 65 you are going to
see the same people going about it at near the same time.  You will
all start out in a newbie zone, move to the next zone.. the next.. the
next.  Start watching for people who always play well with you.  When
you first log in do a /who all Username .  In time one of you.. or
maybe one already is, will show up with a GuildTag.

Ask them about their guild.  DONT Just join a guild thats spaming a
zone.. In fact, that may be a good way to choose to not join a guild.

Questions to ask a Guild.. remeber you interview a guild as much as
they interview you.

"What type of guild are you?"  (raid/faimly)
"How long have you been around?"
"How many members?"
"Do you have a webpage/message board?"
"What are your level ranges?" 

Some rules I have found most often.

A Good guilds normally don't recruit until 25 or 30.   Excpetions of
course for Clerics :)

A Good guild will rarely offer to power level you.  Doing so keeps you
from experincing the game itself.

A good guild will normally have a near 10 to 1 ratio on Officers to
members.
  
A good guild should be able to help you when you have real problems,
but don't expect the guild leader to leave BOT to come and give you
buffs.


Don't be in a hurry to join a guild, I think up to 40 you can go it
alone without a problem... and that gives you time to learn alot along
the way.  If you join a guild, mentally give them 10 days to prove to
you that they are worth your time.  Never be afraid to nicely tell the
guild leader that you dont think you/thry are a good fit, and that you
are choose'n to leave the guild.  

On Starpyre I have had the pleasure to be one of the first 12 members
of a guild, and watch it grow from those 12 people to almost 200.  A
guild can be a trial at imes, but when things work well.. its very
much a pleasure.  The people will mean as much to you as some of your
Real life friends.
