Sorry, Davian doesn't know this one.

I know (for very loose values of know) that the overall haste cap gets
increased as you level.. from something like 80% at 50 to 100ish% at 60.
But I don't think thats what they're talking about.

Theres a somewhat persistant rumor that haste is reduced if the person
wearing the item is too low...  meaning a FBSS for instance would give
almost no haste on a level 1, but would slowly increase up to it's max 21
percent, by about level 20.    (And by extention, a 40% haste item wouldn't
do 40% until level 40.)    I think this is what they are talking about...
but I have no idea if it's true.   I never bothered to test it or anything.
