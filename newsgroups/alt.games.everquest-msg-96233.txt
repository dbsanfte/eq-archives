It changes a lot as you level and depending on if you are in a group or
solo.
The con is supposted to be for a full group, but is still misleading.

You are still quite low level atm so much of this wont help you.

Level 1 fight even cons solo <G>
Level 2 - 6 fight blue or even cons solo
Level 7 - 25 you want to be grouping now you should be able to take
multiple dark blues, even cons (white/black) some yellows or even the
occasional red
Levels 25-35 While a group can take reds and yellows to be efficient you
really want to hunt the lowest level dark blues that you can.
Level 35 + stick to blues, the lower the better, but avoid light blues.

The above is not required, for example a druid can take on single yellow
cons solo up to level 30 at least, however this is normally very risky.
On the other hand once a warrior hits about level 15 they don't really
want to solo anything (due to the massive down time)

The best advice is to keep playing and judge for yourself, but stay
clear of Reds (unless you are the lowest level member of a group) and
concentrate on Dark blues for the most effective xp gain.

HTH,

Jim
