That sums it up pretty well, IMO. I shared your view at one point and 
participated in an all-too-lengthy thread on the subject in this very 
group.

I agree with the above explanation. That said, I do believe that some high-
demand items such as leather padding have some sort of negative modifier 
thrown in for game balance.

Either I experience fewer fails on other higher "trivial" level items, or 
it just hurts less to fail on them and I therefore don't take as much 
notice.
