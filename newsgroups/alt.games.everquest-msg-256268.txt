Hmm... don't remember which server you're on, but if it's E'ci, send me a
tell.   Myself and some friends plan on being in Chardok a few times over
the next couple weeks camping the Echo of Chardok.  Wouldn't bee too much
effort to kill the king while we're there.   (We did so on our first trip.
No echo sightings though. =/  )
