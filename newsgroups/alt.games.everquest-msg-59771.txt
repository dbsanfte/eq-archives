Sounds about ar for course on Jewelcrafting. At skill 243 people asked if I
could make Blue Diamond Bracers. These aren't trivial, unlike the earrings
etc. so i said yes but at your own risk. I made one, then another and seemed
that i couldnt fail. Made about 8 bracers and some earrings with no fails
and no dex buff. Few days later I failed a lot on trivial stuff, even a
silver ruby veil that a new char wanted for his druid. Jewel crafting just
seems to throw in these bogus runs to stop you getting cocky and I havet
found that dex helps but I still dex myself with boon of the garou before
crafting (just in case). If you do use Boon of the Garou, make sure you in a
town that is kindly or ally to you else the merchants will not take kindly
to suddenly finding a werewolf trying to buy from tehm
