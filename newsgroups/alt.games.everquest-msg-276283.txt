Thanks for all the feedback :)

EQ1 sounds huge, if I had the time i'd love to grab all the expansions and 
start a game.

Sadly playing both seems like a full time job so I will stick with EQ2.

I was reading up on the EQ2 graphics engine and according to everything I 
have read it does seem to be setup for the future. Hopefully this will mean 
that as I upgrade the PC the game will look even better.
