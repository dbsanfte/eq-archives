Found it:

"Basically, you can ride it, and move faster than you'd be able to on your own
two feet. According to Butler, because horses won't go any faster than skilled
players can travel, players on foot won't be disadvantaged because all of a
sudden monsters can run faster to make up for horseback riding."

From http://eqvault.ign.com/archive/arc1.shtml

The last sentence is worded poorly, but it basically says mobs will not be
sped up.  I think this quote is the source of much of the confusion.
