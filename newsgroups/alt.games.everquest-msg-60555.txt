Thee's, thou's, and kissing GM ass, hmm?

I got involved in an event in Nek Forest recently, with an attack by a clan
of Dark Elves.  I went after their main tank.  Another tank of theirs went
after me.  My exact, full response to him when he started to attack was
"Bugger off, lad, I'm busy".

Lots of ass-kissing there.

As for thee's and thou's, I never use 'em.  My character isn't a
fancy-schmancy High Elf, he's a rock-solid (and rock-headed) Dwarf.

My reward for challenging the main GM tank to duel (I'm level 40, 58 days
played) was a Runed Lava Pendant.  Very nice item for me.  For you, it's
probably trash that's not worth picking up off the ground.


Role-playing is important to me.  Each of my characters is different.  My
Halfling Rogue (especially when sneak/hiding across zones like EW or LFay)
will sing.  In OOC.  Favourite songs are things like "Poisoning Pigeons in
the Park" and "The Masochism Tango".  My Shaman won't lift a finger to help
a kiter, but will buff to the gills any Mage or Wizard who's in melee
combat.  My Necro rarely ever talks to anybody.
