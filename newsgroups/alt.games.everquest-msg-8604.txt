If you can't handle a half hour to get the exp back .. You won't make it
far. Being a druid, I solo most often. Not by choice really. I've spent 5
hours zoning in and out of Karnor's Castle (due to stupid people's trains --
one trained the Captain to zone and ninja'd a Jade Mace during the fray
after zoning back in) trying to find a group .. Then I give up and hunt some
wyverns in Cobalt Scar.

A death at my level, without a rez, means easily a day of nonstop playing,
which can be over a week of casual playing which I'm starting to do more
often.

Two blues at your level is NOTHING compared to the 2.75 blues I lose at 54.

The game is built to be slow. This isn't Diablo II. There's no "end boss" ..
There's no "winning" .. If leveling went as fast as D2, people would be done
and bored with the game in a month or so.

I've been playing since December '99, my druid since February 2000. It's a
lot of time to put into a game, but when you look at it, it saves you money
when you realize that you could be buying games that would keep your
attention for a month or two at a time. =)

Fighting the same mobs over and over and over again is what the game is
about. It's not necessarily how it was designed, but it's how the players
have ended up playing.

If you'd rather play a fast-leveling game, try Diablo II or one of the newer
games. If you want to spend 10 days of playing time (that's 240 hours)
getting through one level .. then by all means, play EQ. =)
