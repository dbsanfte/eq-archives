There is no way a druid, regardless of level, is going to be able to =
solo their epic.  Ulump has between 30k and 40k hitpoints depending on =
your source, is near 100% MR and double hits for around 200.  That fight =
alone would wipe a druid.  As far as Faydedar is concerned, the best you =
could hope for is a group of people 60+ with good resists have taken him =
down, but once again, with him fearing, AE 500 pt DD, and you having to =
be in melee range to cast on him, once again, a druid soloing him would =
be another CR waiting to happen.
