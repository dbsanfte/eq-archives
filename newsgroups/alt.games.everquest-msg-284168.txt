The number is a multiplier on the effectiveness of bard songs that
depend on that instrument type.  The actual multiplier is the number
divided by ten.  For example, an item with "brass instrument 20" makes
your brass songs twice (2.0) as powerful, and "percussion 18" makes
percussion songs 1.8 times as effective.  To compare with a TDoK,
compare the number on your gear of choice and the number on the TDoK.
In other words, I don't remember any of the numbers offhand. :)  (TDoK
=24?  not sure.)  Gear like this is generally not as good as what you
could get from a "real" instrument, but it frees you from having to
actually equip, say, a drum instead of your weapons.  The real prize
would be anything that acts like a wind instrument, which would allow
you to go invisible, for example, at moment's notice, without swapping
instruments.

Not all aspects of a song can be modified by instruments.  For example,
I believe that haste and slow percentages are never changed.  (This is
easy to test - sufficiently uber instruments might conceivably multiply
a high end slow to over 100%!  In EQ math, this would prevent the mob
from ever attacking.)  Generally, things like stat boosts and damage
will multiply as you would expect.

Disclaimer: I haven't played my bard in well over two years, but this
is was all true, the last time I checked.
