This post is rather a puzzle -- I'm not aware of any
Jarsath cloak, nor any cloak with "White" in the name that
excludes humans.

Perhaps you mean the Kunzar Cloak, which shows as a white
cloak icon in inventory?  It's true that Humans can't wear
it, but contrary to your post, Ogres, Barbarians, and Trolls
cannot wear it either.  Just the smallish races, although
for some reason Iksar can as an exception.
