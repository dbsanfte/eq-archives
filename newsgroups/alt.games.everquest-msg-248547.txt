> What other factors determine how high you levitate?

Where were you looking?  If you are levitating and looking down while you
run, you will lose altitude quickly.  If you look up while you run, you
won't lose altitude as quickly.  In Dreadlands, if I head from the west
tunnel (that goes to the spires), east towards KC, looking down, I bottom
out within about 100 yards.  If I look up, I can easily get to KC with
enough altitude to land on top of the building.
