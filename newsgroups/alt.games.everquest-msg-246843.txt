Fluorescent light flickers more visibly than a computer screen because
you don't spend your days looking directly at it, and the peripheral
areas of your eyes notice change (such as flickers) more easily than
the center. As it is, I notice flickers in bright areas on my screen
at 70Hz, like this big white area in my Agent window next to where I
am typing this. Had to raise the frequency to get rid of it.

Out of sync light seen on TV or out of sync TV/monitor seen on TV are
caused by what you said.
