Have there really been any that have come to the end of their life, closed
down etc that haven't invovled closure of the company as well???

UO is still going, EQ is still going and they were the first huge ones.
IIRC isnt Meridian 59 still active? That was the first I heard of....
Heck Avalon is a MUD I used to play and thats still active 10 years on in
the face of MMORPGs.....
