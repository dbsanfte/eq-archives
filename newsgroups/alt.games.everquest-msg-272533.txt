Sorry, poor wording... I did assume that each race had the same
general setup.

What impresses me is the something that Blizzard has always done
well... WoW gradually introduces the game to you so you're never
feeling overwhelmed.  At level 13 I'm just about to make my second
journey to the mainland, and so far I've gone from the newbie area, to
the small town of Dolanaar, to the large city of Darnassus, and each
step along the way I've had some gentle guidance from wise Night Elf
NPCs.  

EQ2 does much the same thing, but it feels a bit more organic and
planned out in WoW.
