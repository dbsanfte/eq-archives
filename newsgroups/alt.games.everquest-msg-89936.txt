I am attempting to make this simple and easy. You can go from 34 - 60
in two zones quadding.  I DID IT.  OT and BW.  With all blues.  You
just have to know were to hunt.  I did it with limited spells.  For
example I did not have (still do not have) the Fist of Karanas (level
58 quad spell).  Just take a little longer.  You can combine any type
of mob you want with this list they all run the same speed.  See
additional notes for BW mobs. At 59 it gets very slow so I did some
Root Doting on anything blue when I could not find enough blues. That
was actually faster.  If you get the 58 spell go to Skyfire and try
your luck.  I went there when I was able to get a necro partner.  On
my server there is never any competition in OT or BW.  Play time 61
days +++.  I had Patch work boots until level 54, wisdom of 189 until
level 55

Overthere  34-46  No animals.  Waste of time.

Level 34-41
thorny succulants
stoneleer coc katrices
sarnak berserkers

Level 41-46
spiked succulants
stonegazer coc katrices
sarnak knights


Burning Woods 46-60  No wurms and no Casting Sarnaks

Level 46-52
Ash hornet,
plaguebone skeleton
tatterback ape

Level 52-58
All Hornets ** Except Scoria
All Skeletons ** Except Warboned
All apes and gorillas ** Except Tatterback Gorillas
Sarnak Champions
All Giants *** All the giants will keep coming at you as long as there
is another giant alive.  	They will not turn away when they are
low on health until the last one.


59 DING 60
Scoria Hornet
Warboned
Tatterback Gorillas
Ancient Giants
**bunch of light blues**
