I too have this similar problem, I'm only just now hitting lvl 9 am a wood
elf druid in kelethin, but the lvl 9 spells cost me a small fortune (well
what to me is a fortune, not having much in way of PP's) I spent like 40
PP's or so just for the 11 level 9 druid spells.
Where and how do I go to earn more pp's? What armor is best and also where
do you get it..and how much is it going to cost?
