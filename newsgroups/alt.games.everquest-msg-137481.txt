Oh man, wait until you see it and that drool will change to puke.  I'll post
a pic of my shammy (whos got one) its a really vile shade of green :(   Good
job stats > vanity for me.

I got it free too (no clue what it retails for).. I gave a cleric friend a
Plate BP free, so he gave me his old BP (the emerald dragonscale) as a thank
you.

The poofing sucks.. it was hard saved by zoning, but they rollbacked hence
he lost it.  Same deal for our guildies and the Tormax head (flowing thought
boots) and axe's.. /rude verant
