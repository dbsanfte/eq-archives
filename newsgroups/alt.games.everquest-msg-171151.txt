Um, pretty much any combination of three well played characters is
going to be powerful.  Fun is much more a matter of how you play the
game than something intrinsic in the characters.

Paladin, Druid, and [Enchanter/Bard] could take on most anything and
win, PC deaths would be rarer than Gnome Monks if the players were
skilled.  But bring plenty of popcorn because some of your fights
are gonna be marathons (make sure your drinks have covers so nothing
spills when charm breaks and you have to act fast).

Three Wizards could be great fun from day one.  Not necessarily
efficient, but definitely fun (go with three different races so
you have a handy starting point for your banter).

And just imagine the maniacal glee with which a ShadowKnight, Rogue,
and Necro could hoist the jolly roger.

I find myself unable to come up with a combo of three that would
not be powerful in the hands of skillful players (yes, even three
Clerics could kick the mobs' asses up one hill and down the next).
