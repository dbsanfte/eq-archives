OK, first of all, what do DKP stand for?  My real question is doesn't
a point system get complicated?  Does anyone ever want no-drop items?
Do you price them on the fly?  I don't know, how does it work?  
My guild uses a class-rep system.  Works really well for distributing
tradables.  Could be a problem with no-drop, since on the average
night only 2/3s of the class reps are there.  Generally if you're
interested in an item, and your class rep isn't there you're expected
to send a tell to either raid leader or related class rep idicating
your level of interest.  After working it out among any others of your
class who also interested in the item.  It works out really well, but
with only about 50 active players we are able to spread things around
pretty well.
What do you guys do with loot gathered in exp groups, both mixed and
guild-only?  Anyone up for a loot-distribution discussion at the
higher end game?  It seems to be the cause of most guild problems, I
see it popping up on every board, is it really that hot a topic?
