Simple, the class is not finished yet, all that has been done so far is to
bring it into line with the other hybrid classes.  I don't expect to see
much for class specific AA simply because there is no specific combat skill
unique to the BL.  Their uniqueness is all in the warder, how it is summoned
and how it is buffed.
