Then I can say this with confidence...you will be a bad enchanter.  You'll
still get groups easily enough...everyone likes clarity, but don't expect to
be on anyone's "must call" list.

Seeing the work done by a good enchanter helps, but it is nowhere near the
same as actually doing the job.  I've played many characters above level 20
(49 enchanter) and I can say this easily:  enchanters are one SON OF A BITCH
to learn well.  Hell, it took me until level 20 to really figure out how
powerful I was, even back then, even without Breeze.

Playing a bard well is a lot easier than playing an enchanter well.  Bards
just need nimble fingers and occasionally need to target a specific critter
to mez it.   Easy.
