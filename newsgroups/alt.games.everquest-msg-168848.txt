Designed around?  Here, let's restore the part of your post I replied to
/quote Bergh
Of course you can do whatever you want.  You can spend your days
hunting in crushbone at level 65.. heck, I just did, and it was a
hoot.

But splitting exp in order to get AA and exp strikes me as equally
silly.

You bring up "silliness", you ask to have your nose rubbed in the
fact that this whole damned discussion is about "silliness".  I'm
amazed, and disappointed, that you failed to figure that one out on
your own.

Again with stating the obvious, while remaining blissfully unaware
of what I was driving at.

Baloney.  I was replying to <your post>, not just any post.  You
passed a value judgement on other players who choose to do something
differently than you without impacting your game in any significant
way.

Not in any useful sense.

It is when <you> get up on your high horse and start disparaging play
choices by other people with nothing but your own preferences as a
source of authority.  You're getting mighty pompous here Lance.

Oh good, a bit of hyperbole, saves me the trouble of creating my own
example.  The difference between splitting exp 50-50 (a minor choice
having very nearly zero impact on anybody else's game) and equipping
a Rusty Short Sword to melee the AoW is so large that you might as
well be comparing a dust devil in the back yard to a thermonuclear
explosion.  You've got a lot of fucking nerve calling me out of order
in the same post you make that comparison.
