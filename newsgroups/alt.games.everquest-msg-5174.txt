Thanks Dan.  It really was devasting.  Today I continued to petition (I was
told by the Chat GM that petitions lapse after 2 hours, so every 2 hours I
petitioned again.)  I did not sign off all day, but did not get a response.

In the meantime, I made level, saved enough to buy some more spells, upped
my equipment a bit further, and am feeling pretty good.  If the GM-Admin
ever responds and offers to set me back to where I was before the crash, I'm
not sure I want to do that.  What I would really like is to get $
reimbursement for everything that went poof.  But if not, I guess I'll just
carry on.
