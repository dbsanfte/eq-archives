Hmm this is very different to my experience....I found at level 20 and
later doing stuff other than xp grinding massively slowed advancement
didnt appreciably add to gampleay of lower levels. Sub 10th all the little
quests were fun and interesting to chase after and complete giving not
unreasonable xp, my tradeskills coud be advanced rapidly by collecting
bits off mobs and using them without slowing down my advancement of level
(useful to get around the world safely) 10th-20th I was really exploring
the wqorld and that was interesting so xp really became kinda secondary, I
got it as I explored rather than exploring for xp. Now I pulled to 25 and
26 I can reasonably track about all over the main continents of odus,
antonica and Fawdywr with no problem, and if I want xp there's xp farms
all over for me and its back to the exploring of 10th-20th, with the added
bonus that the loot droppped is now useful to me beyond a cash value n
many cases. I really ought to go and give Kunark a really good look now
(so far stuck to FV, Warsilicks and Lake).

The teens were really good levels and 25+ seems to have got that back from
the 20-25 bracket which was less fun.
