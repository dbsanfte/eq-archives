GD faction is a large issue, largely b/c of the ring wars.  Basically, there
are three- Coldain, Giant and Tizmak.  Ry'Gorr in EW as well.  Depending on
race, you may be KOS or not to some/all of these.  For example, I was
non-KOS to Tizmak and Coldain upon arriving in GD the first time, and KOS to
the giants.  This was as a HEF Paladin.  Every single thing you kill in
GD/EW affects your faction.  For example, kill enough giants and you can go
into the wurm caves and the city in there.  Kill too many Coldain and you
cannot go into Thur anymore.  Don't just run around killing random things-
it may affect what you can/cannot do, and may lead to a PITA faction build
day later on.  The SAFEST thing to hunt in GD is Tizmak.  You may not be KOS
to them yet, but it only takes killing 10 or 15 of them to get there.  Also
the Kodiak caves have no faction hits that I know of.
