Ok, honestly, I don't really know who I'm talking to out here anymore; I've
made maybe 3 posts in 2 years and I haven't lurked more than 5 times in the
last year, but I really was surprised each time to feel that EQ was still
there.

I quit a bit ago, roughly when OoW came out and EQ2 killed everyone's
interest. It was the thing to do. But I hadn't been having terribly much fun
anyway. I was playing a war and found that I just would never be able to
catch up.

But of those that quit, some returned - and some of those are my good
friends, my old group.

So here I am, watching the patcher ... travelled a few hours to grab my old
cd's out of storage and yeah, it'll be patching all night.

Anyway, I'm back. I plan on playing my old toons with my fennin ro buddies
and also rolling up a newbie on firiona. I won't be hardcore but I could
conceivably be playing 3-4 nights a week plus some weekends - coincidentally
(or maybe this is denial about interrelated addiction), I ended up getting
back together with my college gf (fennin.lelola, 67 mage) a few months ago
and found out she was still playing EQ. Today, with that feeling of wonder
that comes from things going back to normal after seeming impossible, I
decided to play again. I read through most of the patch messages from the
last 14 months.

So...email? That's awesome. "Re-envisioning" that means tuning up the 1-50
game and spells? That sounds good ... did it work out? Are characters in
shroud fun to play? It seems everyone with a lowbie friend would be shrouded
all the time, till the friend caught up. And how is the task system working
out, is it fun and rewarding? For the record, I really did enjoy all the
expansions (except LoY, obviously) and didn't get LDoN until it was out a
while - but absolutely loved it.

I'm happy to get pointed to any guides that reveal shifts in mechanics,
updates on spells/skills, info on the last 3 expansions (think: gemdiver's
guide to PoP flagging [written by a fellow fennin-ite, tyvm!] but less
spoiler-ish if possible), stuff like that. I'm obviously most interested in
the big changes, and I still don't care about tradeskills. Or just a /t (or
email, how cool is that!?!) would be cool, anyone looking to help a
newbie-veteran, or anyone trying to get me on their server :p

WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO!!!!
