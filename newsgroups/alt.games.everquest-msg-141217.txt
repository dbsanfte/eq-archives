Sorry to do this on here but i don't feel like the hassles of EBay. Some RL
issues reguarding cash have pronpted me to rid myself of my 3yr addiction.
I have an account on the Luclin server with a 55 mage, 55 beastlord, 51
Necro, 51 Wizard, 40 Druid, 34 Shaman, 26 Bard, and 10 chanter.
Some of them are naked and some decently equipped. Beastlord is over half
way through epic. This will be up for grabs to the highest bidder within
reason (ie....it wont be cheap). Please discuss all terms with me via e-mail
at Woodleaf3840@hotmail.com.
Thanks
