I'm a 29 bard at the moment, with the Vah Shir
quest lute that equips in Primary slot (so that it
allows you to keep a weapon in your secondary
slot... making juggling in on the beat dead easy)

Most of the time I solo, and this is what I sing

Selo's Accelerando on while approaching mob
get in position
Jonathon's Warsong
Selo's Consonant Chain
move back to pull position

As the mob strolls to my stopping point, I start
my twist in earnest;

Jonathon's Warsong
Hymn of Restoration (swap in Lute as it hits, then right back out)
Selo's Consonant Chain
repeat till mob dead, or till I"m clearly losing.

The combination of Haste for me and Slow for the mob, plus a
12hp per tic regeneration, really seems to work better than most
other combinations I've tried.  The fact that I"m already using
Chains also means that I don't need to worry about when the
mob is going to start running and swap that in for snare effect,
the song aggros and snares for happy pulling, slows during the
fight to minimize incoming damage, then snares to RIP (Running
In Place) when the mob flees.

I'm thinking of using Chords of Dissonance instead of Hymn during
the early portion of the fight, or for easy fights.  Just learned that
strings -triples- the Chords' damage output, so if I'm not using
the full effect of Hymn this might make a good substitute.... assuming
I"m not fighting mobs that resist.  Good thing about Hymn in the
twist is its never resisted!

I experimented with Psalm of Warmth, but a Chains/Warmth
combination actually degrades the performance of the warmth,
as I get hit less often.  At the same time, I usually dont' really
want to get hit -more- often!  The one use I have for Warmth
is when being Power Leveled, adding more DS damage on to the
major DS my friend is slapping on me, helping chew thru the
crowds of 6 or so mobs at a time that are our normal PL plan.

I've also looked at Denon's Disruptive Discord, but I'm not up to
juggling out two weapons to get a brass in on the tic in good
enough time to not lessen the weapons damage output significantly,
not to mention then swapping that for lute to hit hymn on the
beat... yes I -can- perform this little juggle but its a stunt for
me, not a plan, and not something to be messing with in combat.
At any rate, against blue/black mobs I don't have much trouble
hitting so the AC debuff isn't all that important, and against
yellow/red ones the Discord is often resisted, so it doesn't work
when its needed!  The DOT is nice but if I have to pick this or
Chords, Chords is a bigger DOT.

Anything I'm overlooking?  AC buff songs don't seem to matter
much, Fear Kiting is incredibly clumsy (I fear kited as a cleric
with snaring partners for a lot of my clerical carreer, and
a kite where snare breaks frequently so the mob runs off,
or fear breaks frequently so I'm spending 3/4ths my time tanking
anyway, just seems silly in comparison.  I know what Fear
kiting looks like and this isn't it!) Chant of Battle doesn't seem
to have any noticable effects (not using Proc weapons) nor does
Anthem (haste doesn't stack and the Str boost doesnt seem to
do anything useful)

One thought was Largo's Melodic Binding... but that seems to have
the same slow as Chains, and doesn't have the easy snare effect,
on the other hand if I'm being beat by multiple mobs the AE slow
would be handy... meaning that I should consider this when using
charm; same slow on the mob I and my pet are fighing, and each
time my pet comes up for air he's slowed while he beats on me
till he's charmed again.
