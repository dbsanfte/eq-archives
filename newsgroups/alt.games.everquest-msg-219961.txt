Fire and Ice fellas in the caves Umbral are 1 groupable, can take a boatload
of time on 'em but way doable.  Might want to try out the revamped named in
Siren's Ghetto also.  Things like 6 person Vindi are out unless one is 
excessively uber, least that's what I'd think.  Hmmm, Velk *might* be feasable,
proably would depend on gear to a large extent.  HoT very doable (if you 
don't already have ornate/ldon armors).  Going on a 6 person Black Reaver
rampage in CoM is always amusing too, especially if you get one of the
infamous 100+ Reaver splits. :) Ohhh do all the PoJ Trials, get the 
Mark of Justice! Erm Ratticus in PoD and undoubtedly many things I've missed.

Good!
