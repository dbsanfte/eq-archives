Actually, you may be more correct than you know.  The World Trade Center was
conceptualized by a gentleman who founded it for the purpose of world peace
through trade and business.  People meeting people and dealing with them
face to face.  No politics, diplomacy, or military...just people doing
business.  Kind of ironic that it would be the target of a terrorist act.
Makes you wonder what he must be feeling today.
