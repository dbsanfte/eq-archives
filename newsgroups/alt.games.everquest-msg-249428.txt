The activation can only be used once, then it's worthless. That being said,
SoE might be persueded to give you a valid key if you call their support.
I've been told that has actually worked for some PC players (bought game
used at a store, they find key won't work, call SoE), but in that case SoE
is willing to get warm bodies in and paying without much fuss. They give
away basic EQ pc accounts all the time.

Don't know about the ps2 version though.

I forget if the SoE number is an 800 number. If it is, I'd call them, go
through the 2 hour hold, and tell my sad sad story, see if they give me a
valid code.

If it's not, or they can't help you, go back to gamecrazy and get your money
back. Also speak to the manager and tell him that they can't resell games
like that, just to be polite.

As a note, any of the MMOG type games (EQ, FFXI, etc) fall under the same
restriction. SoE is the only company I've ever heard that's been willing to
provide keys for resold games, and I've only heard about that third hand, so
I cannot be certain it's true, in fact I seriously doubt it. So don't buy
the MMOG's used.
