People in uber guilds on other servers "racing" to see who could fill
up a guild of 65's first. A lot of intensive xp-grinding. Also, people
know all the tricks to level fast from scratch, even without twinking
or PLing now. They didn't back in the early days of EQ. I'm not in the
slightest bit surprised that there are 65s there already.

I've been playing since just before Kunark's release. Over the years,
I've played more characters than I can keep track of. I've played
every class and characters of every race. Currently, I have a slate
full of characters on the Tunare server, not to mention a couple on
Lanys, one on Luclin, and maybe a couple more scattered other places.
My 3 highest level characters are 55, 51, and 40. Do I regret not
having a 60+ character with a title and AA's? Nope. I enjoy the
journey a lot more and, honestly, don't envy those who spend a good
chunk of their lives logged into EQ raiding, feeling obligated to do
so for their guilds.

Personally, I enjoy the journey far more than the destination, so to
speak.
