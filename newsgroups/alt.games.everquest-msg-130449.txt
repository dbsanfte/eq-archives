Yes, they each had several factories for either Planes or munitions. Ten
cities were selected for potential A-bombing, all of these were left off the
usual bombing runs, US wanted a more exact report of the damage caused.
Recently they made a movie about the whole prequalication of cities and
peoples thoughts on use and etc.

History is persistent for bringing out the darker bits from ones past. I
would like to show, one day, that in every conflict there is a certain "gray
area" that permeates a battlefield. Where morality is the farthest concern
of any combatant whatever be that persons nationality/religion/value system.
Also, one has to chronicle the vast amount of human achievement and
compassion that have happened in the same circumstances.
