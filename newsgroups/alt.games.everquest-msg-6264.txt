hehhee I love to have a pally in the group and I must say I prefer a pally
from some othere hybrids, thy are still cable of takeing a good beating and
deliver some good dam, and thy can take care of the "little" healing so the
cleric can save mana for infight healing. I was just pointing out what I
miss in a pally, but that might be that I LOVE dual wield, it looks cool and
is one of the skills I think many ppl dont give a chance thy rather go to
2hs or 2hb wich are okay but can be out dam by 2 deasen 1hs/1hb weapons with
a hige skill in dual wield.
