Incorrect.  It's 20%.

Incorrect.  For the longest time it was 10%.

Probably because some of us read the patch messages and
the announcements that Verant has made from time to time
concerning the grouping bonuses.

Analyses using ShowEQ and other methods also proved the
existence of the original 10% full group bonus long ago
(it was +2% for each additional group member, not counting
the first "solo" member of course).

From the January 14, 2001 Producer's Letter (discussing original
game design decisions):

    Aside from making it so that the best gear 
   requires groups, either to get quest items or 
   get the best gear directly, our goal was to make 
   it so that groups could advance faster than a solo 
   player. One way we tried to reach this goal was by 
   putting experience bonuses in dungeons, so our 
   changes mentioned above should certainly help in 
   that area. Another way we tried to reach that goal 
   was by giving a per-kill experience bonus based on 
   the size of the group. 

   [snip]

   Our goal is to get people grouping earlier, and 
   provide them enough of a bonus where they do 
   not feel that they are losing ground during the 
   learning process. We feel we can do this by 
   doubling the grouping experience bonus and by 
   scaling it up based on the size of the group. 
   Currently, the bonus is an additional 2% experience 
   per group member, not counting the first one, 
   leading to a maximum bonus of 10%. Following 
   the next patch, the bonus will be as follows: 
  

      2 person group - 2% total bonus. 
      3 person group - 6% total bonus. 
      4 person group - 10% total bonus. 
      5 person group - 14% total bonus. 
      6 person group - 20% total bonus. 
  
   This bonus is applied to the total experience 
   reward for killing a creature prior to distributing 
   it to the group.
