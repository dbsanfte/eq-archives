Very useful post! I just picked up this thread and I agree totally. I had a
group member once ask my if I was taunting, and I replied, "What is
Taunting?" I didn't even know the skill existed.  Thank goodness this was at
level 5 and now at 24, my taunt and kick are maxed.  Working on bash now....

Only thing with bash is that you must use a shield with it and thereby
eliminating dual attack....
