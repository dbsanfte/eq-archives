Most of the modern-known versions of fairy tales are drasticly
watered-down and "nice-ified". Just taking from Disney's versions:

Beauty and the Beast: The Beast was more than just ugly, he was a
horrid, abusive, violent monster.

Hunchback of Notre Dame: Good old sweet Quasi from the Disney cartoon?
Ummm...no. Deformed freak that got pleasure out of pushing statues off
the ledge onto the people below...

Snow White: Stepmother was forced to dance at her wedding wearing
red-hot iron shoes... The dwarves were a group of rogue-ish types. It
wasn't a "Hey, I'll clean for you guys out of the goodness of my
heart" arrangement, more of a reason for them not to slit her throat
at first... ( The version with Sigourney(however that's spelled)
Weaver is closer to the "real" story )

In the story The Little Mermaid came from, the prince married someone
else. The bargain was that if the mermaid didn't win the prince's
love, she would "turn into seafoam" and die. The witch wound up
promising her she wouldn't die if she killed the prince. Long story
short, there was no happy ending, only a patch of sea foam...
