A.  Who said the ninja was a low level (obviously not if he's 
flagged for HoH).  Being level 65 and a member of a tier 3 guild
doesn't necessarily mean you're not a theiving asswipe.  In fact,
some of the most despicable behavior on my server comes from members
of one of the top 2 or 3 guilds there.  

B.  If a raid member had looted it, his group would have been 
notified by EQ that he had.(the raid too?  Bleh, since my guild
imploded I haven't raided, can't remember if the loot message is
raid wide)
