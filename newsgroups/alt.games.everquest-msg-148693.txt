They probably actually exist in the game database, but may never have 
dropped...  There was that fellow here the other day explaining how to 
edit your hotkey file to check out other items in the database.

}::ahem::  As I was saying, I don't see any way for players to spoof 
}something like that... but if you were a Verant employee and sick of the 
}whining, what would your ultimate revenge look like? :)

A 2HS with incredible stats and an esoterically-named proc like Al'Kabor's 
Transubstantiation, that randomly deletes your character while in combat.

Although the Prince in PoG is pretty good, too.
