Stuff cut about what eq is like basically, no plot, people being
goobers, people getting you killed, lots of boredom trying to always
grab your next just out of reach goal ( jboots, tov armor, planes
armor, your epic, whatever), tons of time to get to the place where
the game becomes more leet ( kk i'm doing lots of paraphrasing
there..) and how single player games are far better and more fun.

Yeah, sounds to me like your friend found out in a short time what it
took me like 2 years to find out (and I still play) tell him to get
OUT NOW! ;)

I mean, when you think about, just explaining to someone starting EQ
how they should play makes it obvious its not a fun game at all. 

"You go out and hit some rats and skeletons and orc pawns for hours
and sell their crap for pennies and wear their armor and weapons.
After doing this for several days you are level 10 in leather armor
and beating on larger rats and skeletons and orcs"
