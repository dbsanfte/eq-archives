I'm with you. Professionals? Not at Verant evidently.

As I understand it from Conquest's site, Verant's press release, and this
log Verant tried to deal with them and accidentally set off a
not-current-Sleeper super mob. They lost badly. They had lost to the guy
before that. So, it's even worse. This means they weren't even trying to do
what they did!

I'm with you. Frankly, that is the story I would've put out in my press
release. As it stands it appears less incompetent than Verant's published
story.

Exactly! I am almost uncomfortable playing without a list! What happens if
we un-wittingly stumble into an exploit? From Conquest's screenshots you can
see that they were not, in any way, aware that they were "exploiting." In
fact, it's obvious from the log that they thought it was their site's parody
of the Sleeper that had gotten them into trouble.

Yeah. Do we know what happened with these other guilds? Was there any
punishment of anyone else for such a tactic?

Until something better comes alive, eh? ;-)
