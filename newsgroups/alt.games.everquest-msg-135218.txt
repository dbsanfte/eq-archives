 I don't ever believe I did...

At most, I might have accused you of supporting and/or condoning the
ADH Terrorists.  Which, by today's standards IS as bad as being a
terrorist....

However, my memory ain't what it used to be and, depsite anything I
might have said in the past, I do not consider you an ADH Terrorist,
as you have not attacked my wife or children, as Goondi/MD/Tony et al
have done..


Don't forget to call yourself a terrorist since you have posted crap about your
daughter under the nic Tanya Worley.
