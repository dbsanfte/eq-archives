FWIW. Real life I kind of a prick. Doing things in EQ I wouldn't normally do
in RL because it doesn't cost me anything but time is interesting to me.

I pretty much hate beggers as much as anybody. I was doing a lot of dungeon
diving with my shammy trying to get faction up a bit while camping a slow
spawn. Just hitting everyone that happened by with a SoW or a buff unasked.
At one time or another I probably SoW'd, healed, or buffed, everyone in the
dungeon. It didn't really cost me any time or needed mana since the spawn
was so slow.

Missed spell target, few fizzles, was enough to get multiple blues aggresso
on my character and in serious trouble. I let out a shout for help thinking
"fat chance" and to my supprise the whole dungeon congregated on my
character's location and between the heals and help saved my bacon.

Refecting on the experience I think I understand now what happened. I mean
my 'prick' RL self kind of thinks in terms of people that are overtly
generous as kind of weak and stupid. I always wondered why Darwinisn didn't
breed them out of the population.

Now I think I get it. The self interest beggers don't necessarily want to
see you die because it could mean an end to their free SoWs. The 'nice guys'
see you as a fellow traveler and don't want to see you die. The rugged
individualist who would like a SoW but are to proud to ask regard you as an
ally.
