Lizardmen, Basilisks, Cyclops, and Giant Skeletons all share spawn
points with HGs and are apparently PHs.  Basicly, if it isn't a guard
and it isn't part of the Hasten cycle (Hasten, Brother Z(?), "a drake",
and I think one other non-usual mob) and it is on or near HG hill, it
is probably a PH and should be killed.  At least, that policy worked
well for me back when I hunted there.

To give credit where due: I first saw that info posted here by bizbee.
I confirmed it as best I could by observation.  As I said, it worked
well for me.
