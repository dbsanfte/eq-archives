I got mixed replies.  A couple people said, "welcome to Everquest... people

Yes, it's wrong, it's considered disruption of the game and it's
petitionable.  Those who said it was just part of the game didn't know what
they were talking about.  If it happens again petition.  For some reason HK
attracts bored players who like to get kicks out of annoying other people.
