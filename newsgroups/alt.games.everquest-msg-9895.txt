   Have never said he left any writings as I have stated if you could read
at all.  You reading ability seems to be somewhere about the kindergarten
level.  Your mind is more messed up then a used bubble gum wrapper. Now
break out a thesaurus and look up the word "read" and contemplate to your
self if you are at all possible which because your stupid trash ass is so
messed up on drugs its got to be totally impossible for your little brain to
comprehend a GOD damn thing..

   You got to be a Verant employee. Your just as stupid as they are if not
worse.

  leave the news group Bizbee, everyone knows what a ignorant troll you are.

  If ya don't want to see IMOs, then block me by all means.  Just because
you disagree doesn't mean I'm not right.  And like wise. Before you rant at
me, please read Plato, Socrates, Crito, Kant and other Philosophers.
