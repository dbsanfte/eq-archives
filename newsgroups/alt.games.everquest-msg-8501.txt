You know, my current favorite character wears a Freeport Reserve Militia
Tunic for exactly this reason. It took a loooong time for the character to
earn the trust of the Militia, and it took a lot of deathfist belts to get
there. It was grueling, thankless work, and there were times when I
considered giving up and accepting that the Militia were just never goingto
trust the character enough to give them the Cutthroat Ring quest. When they
finally did, the character already had *far* better chest armor than the
Reserve Militia Tunic.

Guess what the character wears?

There is a sense of pride and accomplishment from earning something, and you
just don't get that from buying it or having it handed to you because some
generous soul recently got their Unbelievium Breastplate from the Plane of
Megaloot and doesn't need it anymore.
