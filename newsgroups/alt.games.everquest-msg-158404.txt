Once you are in late 40s and 50s, it can be hard to group.  Up till
then, druids do just fine in groups.  They are still a great "jack of
all trades": healer, nuker, crowd controller, whatever.  I functioned
as the group healer in karnors in my late 40s and did just fine with
people who knew what they were doing.

Some people are just kind of stupid about grouping with druids. 
Probably the same people who think that because they already have a
clarity they don't need an enchanter.
