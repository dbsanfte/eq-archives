Yes, but that could be farmed so easily it wouldn't even be funny.  All you
do is try to do a bunch of different things until you find the skills you
need to train to become FS.  Then it's just a matter of trying combinations,
annoying busy work, to be sure, but certainly possible given a few weeks or
so of playing around.  You could even make another char or the same race and
sex on a different server and test that char's skills, so you could compare
and figure out almost the exact combinations.
