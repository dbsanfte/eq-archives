 There you go.

 I pull with a dispel stick. This removes sow about 90% of the time.

 At 60 a running mob in Sebilis does not cause adds. Unless you happen
to do something dumb like continuing to chase it which only makes it run
further.

 Snare in HS isn't an issue because I would be soloing the basement.
Skellies don't run.

 SS isn't really an option. They move too fast and hit too hard to make
it a viable solo spot. There are many better options for me.

 Sure we can. And if they're dark blue you can ID them. I've juggled
between two mobs many times in Karnors by fearing one, beating on the
other for a bit then making him run off when the other one comes back.

 Which takes much longer than I can do it, even including my heal time.
Free root does what, 10 damage. Free DoT gets you 330 or so. Sure you
can kill any mob that way given enough time. Hardly an efficient way of
doing things though.

>We can't travel..

 We can't? Why not?

>We can't solo dragons..  pos monk class !!

 I agree with that!
