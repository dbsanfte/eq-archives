You're an idiot.  If you'd actually read his post with your brain engaged
(although your inability to follow simply post-formatting rules calls into
question whether you have a brain), you'd see that he knows about his mana
pool and how it works--he knows that raising WIS raises it, as does adding
+MANA items.  He also observed that the effect of WIS doesn't seem to be
very much, and so is question is implicitly about the effectiveness of
various mana-raising methods.
