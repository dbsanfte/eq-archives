Rangers can eventually tank middling-well. Not as well as the plate
classes, and in the tougher Planar camps you almost certainly want
a plate tank, but certainly well enough for tanking most pre-PoP,
non-raid-level targets. (And even some of the raid targets up to
Kunark.)

I've healed for rangers tanking Black Reavers, a couple of Hole
raids, Top Dogs in Velks, and even the Exe trials. They did pretty
well - not as well as a Warrior, perhaps, but they were better able to
consistently hold aggro than a warrior. Partly due to the damage done,
and partly because they get some very nice aggro management spells.

You could think of rangers as ghetto tanks in the same way that
druids can be ghetto clerics. :-)
