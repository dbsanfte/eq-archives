Sadly this is true in my experience on a *RPG* server and made me quit
forever after only 4 weeks although I had paid for 6 months.
Hearing people talk about the consistence of their *shit* in a public
channel on a RPG server was the last nail in the coffin,I am not
exaggerating or joking.  :(
Other than that I really liked WoW,especially its great stabiltiy and
bugless state it was released with,I played shortly after release.
EQ1/2 looks like an Alpha product compared to WoW in regards
of bugs and stability.
Maybe SOE should look at those issues instead of making the games
so easy that my hamster could play them,especially EQ2,to attract
more players.
