And in theory point systems are very fair.

Where they become 'unfair' is when officers manipulate how points get 
doled out, and how many dkp an item is worth.

Some dkp systems favour clerics and the MT for example by awarding them 
extra points for showing up, or reward people extra for being group 
leader, raid leader, etc... (where being group leader / raid leader is 
based on your friendships with the officers more than anything else)

Some favour weekday players over weekends, by setting the dkp for a 
weekday raid higher.

Some give new members less dkp.

Some will award items based on nbg or officers discretion if two people 
want the same thing, instead of just letting the player willing to spend 
'more' have it.

Many favour players with attendance greater than X. So if you show up to 
less than X% of the raids in a month you get zilch or some other 
variation of that. (If somebody only shows up to 1 in 20 raids he's 
already working with 5% of the maximum dkp... I'm not quite sure why he 
needs to have even that taken away...)

Some create different clases of dkp... 'special dkp' are accumulated 
only against 'special targets'... and you can only spend 'special dkp' 
to get drops from those targets. (So now the guy who shows up to 90% of 
the raids but missed the last 5 'special raids' still doesn't have any 
dkp for any 'special drops'.

And on and on... it goes ad nauseum.

And finally, dkp systems almost invariably evolve... so you might join a 
guild, earn a pile of dkp waiting for that special drop, and then have 
the rules change on you so you'll never be able to spend it... e.g. by 
adding a raid attendance requirement.

point systems have a lot going for them... but a truly fair points 
system is about as likely as a fair tax system. "Fair" means different 
things to different people, and the various meanings contradict eachother.

On the whole I think points systems are better than most other systems 
for guilds. But they aren't exactly necessarily shining examples of equity.
