    Because now to get items I desire I have to chase halfway around the
damned planet to camp them. The evil, scum-sucking farmers that used to
waste THEIR time camping stuff won't be, because they cannot. I am now also
forced to not just group, but find friends all at my level or damn near
close to it to drag around the world, because most players won't go into the
places where the solid items drop. No pickup groups, no camping - BYOG! So
levelling up is going to be even slower than before.

    No, because OTHER PEOPLE can't do that FOR me. Go to EC some time, look
at the low-end item auctions, and ask yourself how many of those items were
farmed. OK, done that? Now, if those farmers weren't there, how many folks
do you suppose would have left the outdoors XP conveyor belt to camp those
items? How many people would have obtained items they would use personally,
which would NOT hit the open marketplace?

    Plat is good for two things: buying stuff from a merchant, and as a
medium of exchange with other players. If there's no items being sold, do
you really think people will care about plat anymore? Have you ever BEEN in
a "trade-only" economy? Pre-Kunark was like that, for the top end items. If
you wanted one, you had to camp. YOU HAD TO CAMP. Blech!

>If that was what you

    My experiences in The Warrens are different. Every so often a high level
comes in, decides they want the loot. Makes a deal with a low-level or a
buddy. Pulls every named to zone, bashes it to near-dead, zones, low level
finishes the mob. High level comes back, loots or logs on twink to loot,
moves on. It still gets farmed, only now the low level players get the XP on
killing the named. Whoop-de-damn-doo.

    Meanwhile, the only people in Sol A are the farmers, and one brave XP
group that clings to a zone line. Runnyeye is empty. Upper Guk is empty save
item/silk farmers, the AC camper, and whoever just got trained out of Lower
Guk. Perma is empty except for the Mammoth Cloak camper. Paw has a few
people farming the Ishva/summon corpse, and a group or two clinging to the
zone. These places are barren wastelands, except for the farmers. So where's
the problem?
