*has memories of camping the damned Mutant for Paw of Opalla....*

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!

*slams head against monitor*

The bad part is that I have the three other rings so I can get ANOTHER
paw*.  Haven't worked up the courage to camp for the gold again
though.  That sucked ass.

*Yes, I know they're lore.  But if I get the gold ring, I can give my
Paw to my cleric buddy and get a new one for me.
