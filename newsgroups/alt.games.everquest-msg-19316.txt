After level 29 or 30 you can use the goblin banker in Runnyeye, he's also
the only banker the GMs won't get angry with you for killing, hehe

theres also a goblin bartender in there, but he wont sell to you unless you
sneak to be indifferent ( not sure if FD works though )

Yes, the SK trainers in FP or Qeynos are most likely KoS to you

You will be apprehensive in Thurgadin, just like everyone else starts out as

In Ocean of tears all the people on Zachariah Reigh's island are on some
esoteric faction called "Human" that apparently everyone starts out
indifferent to. ( 3 vendors on the island, 2 sell fishing stuff, 1 is a
default inn vendor with bread, water, rations, iron rations, bandaids, a
couple types of booze and a box of lute strings )
