Yeah...that was the exploit I meant.  I'd heard of it many times,but
it just seemed waaaaay too blatant of an exploit to even attempt.
Getting suspended/banned during working on your epic would
suck :-).  Phinny would nuke the Eye, and then come all the way up
to the zone to fight it out, where he'd be ganked by a surprised
couple of groups at the zone in.

A_wizard_01 says "Phinny's up? Hehe, watch this"
