There is a status bar on the patcher which shows a solid color as it
downloads and a thin blue line in the middle which denotes how much
through the complete download you are.  If you deleted the file from
the Everquest folder you should be downloading files through the
patcher so something sounds wrong ... You are sure that you deleted the
window_pieces_02.tga file from your Everquest folder before patching?
