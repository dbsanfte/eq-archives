Despite the fact Naubi tells me tide is doing super duper
well (and stop being so mean to her! ;) ), Tide is an exception;
EQ is down on server numbers and guilds are folding. That may
not be 'dying', but its sure as hell contracting. 

Once my girl and I get bored of EQ2 maybe Suiddy will be back
on Venril demanding to know why she hasnt been trained recently ;)

Right now though... shrug. I cant see converting her to a less
slick game than EQ2.
