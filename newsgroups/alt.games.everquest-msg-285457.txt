- Requirements -

You have to be a new costumer to PartyPoker.com and not have the client
installed on your computer.
Only 1 account per IP-adress/Person.
You can't live in USA, Turkey or Romania.
You have to fill in valid details, mail and phonenumber.

- Why do they give away free money, are you trying to trick me? -

No I am not trying to trick you. This is totally legit and it has been
done by millions of people allready.
Why do they give away the money? you might ask.
That's why PartyPoker.com want as many customers as possible to visit
their site. And they hope that you might deposit some money if you have
lost the free $75. But you don't have to do that.

So just play tight and agressive (best strategi) and I will see you at
the tables and I will see you there!

Good Luck and Follow the instructions / PokerJoker!
