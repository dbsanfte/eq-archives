    Right click on one of the members of that faction (in this case one of
the guards) or targe them (left click) and hit C

    That's (C)onsider - and it will show you colour codes for their level
relative to yours (red high above yellow above white your level blue just
below good exp light blue far below bad exp green no exp far far below),
which is a loose guide to who will kick your ass or not, and also the
wording of the sentence will come up.

    scowling: will attack on sight
    glares threateningly: will attack within a largish radius
    glares dubious: wont attack but wont trade or answer you politely
    apprehensive: will trade and talk to you but would really rather you
went elsewhere
    all nice sounding ones: likes you and wants to have your babies
