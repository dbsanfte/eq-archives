Right click on Main Chat, go to Filter, and turn off OOC... I THINK that 
should do it.

I have set mine up to have guild, group, and tells in one window, melee in 
another (since for some odd reason hitsmode appears to no longer be working 
for me- on and off work but I can't window it off) and everything else in 
Main.

I love the new interface and the ability to hack it is very cool.
