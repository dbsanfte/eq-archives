A friend of mine had some good experience with a gnome at the same time
I was having trouble with the undead.

I quickly switched to an orc, and had a fairly easy time.

Now, things are pretty calm, except for last night's occasion of people
4 levels above me camping a unique spawn I needed to complete a quest. I
have no idea what that was about, and they didn't exactly respond to
questions. :(
