The problem comes in that stuns are big taunts.  Add to that the fact that 2
of the 3 stuns have a stun and a damage component, which gives 2 chances to
resist, and eventually you are going to have a PO'ed mob nuking the heck out
of your cleric.

I keep my highest stun memmed while grouped (replaced with Atone while
running from point A to point B).  Right after a pull, I wait for 1 "round"
of combat, then toss the stun.  Even if it doesn't land there is usually
enough agro from the tank to keep it from charging me.  That 1 stun in a
meat grinder group can give the tanks the chance to bring a mob to half
before they really even get hit.  Add a wizzy nuke right after, and a
druid/ranger snare, and you have a slow fleeing mob that never even got a
chance to attack.  Ahhh, those were the good groups in the Dreadlands.

Of course, doesn't work on giants or dragon-types (shardwurms for example).
