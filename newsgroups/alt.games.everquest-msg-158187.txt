For about the dozenth time, you won't have that problem if
you use the /viewport command in the new UI to set your
preferred screen size.  It takes five seconds to resize
the "view screen", and you can make it any size, and any
position, you want.

Yes, there's a small bit of "retraining" time before you
can use/customize the new UI most effectively, but once
you do you'll wonder why on earth you stuck with the old UI
for so long.  The new UI gives you complete control over
almost every aspect of the screen you might ever want to
personalize.

How long was your grandfather riding a horse after everyone
else was driving cars?
