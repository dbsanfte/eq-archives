Serving 7000 email users while doing DNS and HTTP is about an order of
magnitude less work than serving an EQ world.  Think about it some.
Start with running the AI for about 25000 mobs.  Then throw in
processing movement commands from 3000 users, which need semi-real
time response.  Without even getting to tracking items and handling
combat and things like this...just limiting ourselves to moving around
25000 mobs according to their AI and letting 3000 players run around
without a lot of warping from client/server sync problems, and you
dwarf what your little mail and web server has to deal with.
