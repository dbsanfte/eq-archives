I recall while sitting in LGuk with my group, having the shaman LD.
She stands up and casts a spell.  What was the spell?  Spirit of the
Wolf...

LD casters cast a LOT of spells.
When we did Overking back when he had that AoE LD, my rogue reported
that I was chain casting superior heals to keep myself alive after I
LDed.  The same fucking spell I would fizzle a couple of bubbles of
mana, I was able to chain cast seemingly with infinite mana to keep
myself alive through the AoE nukes.

Going LD sometimes is beneficial.
For example, did you know level 57+ rogue, monk and warrior when LD
will revert to NPC mode and gain all NPC abilities?  Including the
ability to ENRAGE at 10% health allowing them to riposte all attacks
for about 15 seconds.

Yep, thems the breaks.
People have been dealing with it for 2.5 years and still managed to
get to level 60.  Suck it up and move on.
