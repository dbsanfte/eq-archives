You drag the gem icon to your hotkey bank the same way you drag anything 
else, click and hold on it until it pops up on the icon, then drag it to 
the appropriate spot.

What it really does for you is give you a one-key approach to casting the 
spell.  Say you dragged your eight hotkeys to slots 1 through 8.  You 
don't make any macros or anything else, you just have the gems on your 
hotkey bank.  You want to cast the spell in slot 1.  You can do any of the 
following:  type /cast 1, click on the first gem icon up top with the 
mouse, click on the first hotkey gem icon with the mouse, hit alt-1 
OR....just hit 1 on your keyboard.  That's the real advantage, being able 
to just hit a single key to cast a spell.  
It may not be a big issue for some folks, but I find it almost impossible 
to use the mouse for targeting AND to click on the spell gems.  I haven't 
clicked on a spell gem in probably 55+ levels.

I'm not sure about the best complete guide, as much of it seems to be 
class specific.  The bard sites (i.e. www.eqdiva.com) have a lot about it, 
especially in the guides and discussion section.  Sensi Jadeleaf's guide 
has a very good write-up http://www.eqdiva.com/guides/guide1.asp (and is 
probably the best single bard overview in existance).  
I would suspect that your class specific sites might have useful 
information also.
