If you own POP then it is pretty simple.  Roll up one of the Dark
Elves, use book to go to POK.  Roll up a temporary Iksar, use book to
go to POK.  Group together and spend an hour doing the language stuff.
 Delete Iksar.  Repeat with any other races/languages you want.  Then
roll up new permanent DE and have first one teach second all the
languages.
