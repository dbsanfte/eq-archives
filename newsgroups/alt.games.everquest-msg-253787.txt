Get the XP compatability kit from MS web site, and setup the EverQuest.exe
to ignore Alt-Tab requests. You can then use the standard alt-tab to switch
between applications, and even instances of EQ.

Theres a post on the EQWindoes Forum that goes into detail on how to do this
and where to get the XP compatability tool kit from ( an exact link at MS ).

This will only work with XP  though.
