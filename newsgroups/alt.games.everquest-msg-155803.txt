Last night my Warder looked like a smaller version of a Silvermist
Wolf like you see in North Karana. (grey legs and underbelly, black
fur on back). He was also much smaller than before the patch. (smaller
than the mist wolf he resembled. I didn't mind the change in color,
but I sure missed having "Big Fifi" walking beside me.
