Well, Rudnom is now 39 and has max foraging.  He sits and forages during my
raids, mostly sitting in Rathe Mountains since I discovered I also need
copious number of eggs and basilisk eggs can be foraged their, too.

I do want to get Rudnom up to 46 so he can zone into PoK and lev me when
needed (see, I found another excuse to keep leveling him up), and
power-leveling has become excruciating.  After trying out various zones,
I've found nothing better than LGuk for power-leveling.  I get about 2% XP
per kill, with kills not coming particularly quickly.

Druids, however, are supposed to be great soloers, behind only necros and
maybe bards, and from what I gather 39 is about the level they start being
effective soloers.  Specifically, they can start quad-kiting aviaks in
Timorous Deep.  So I'd like to try that.

Except I don't know how.

I know in theory what quad-kiting is:  aggro four mobs, find some area you
can run around in circles, keep casting AE nukes, and so on until you kill
them all.  I think that's how it works anyway; it sounds awfully
mana-intensive, and Rudnom isn't exactly dripping with the stuff.

So, I was wondering: does anyone know of a good guide that explains how to
quad-kite?  I checked the Druids' Grove but found nothing good - everyone
just seems to know how to quad-kite.  And I don't want to shame myself in
their eyes by asking such a noobish question.  Y'all know me, though, so I
won't feel too embarrassed asking here.  =)

While we're at it, I'm not exactly sure what aggro-kiting and charm-kiting
is.  I think charm-kiting is charming one mob and getting aggro on four
others, letting them chase you around while your pet beats on them from
within.  But I don't know what aggro-kiting means.

If anyone knows specific guids on how to do these things - what spells to
use, when to cast them, how to keep mana up, etc - I'd love to read it.

Thanks.  It won't be long before I can start getting into fights with necros
over PoS frogs!
