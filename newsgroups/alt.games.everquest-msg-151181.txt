   I am almost positive that he did not.  This perfectly reasonable
question has been asked a few times in this thread, and AFAIK, the
original poster has not been back to say yea or nay.  He or she might be
a little embarrassed by it all.
   No need to be, of course.  I heard my beloved Lenny shout "What the
hell!?" this morning as I was getting ready for work.  When I asked him
what what wrong, he told me that our baby lizard, whom I had just
leveled to 14 the night before, had gone poof.  Of course, my first
question was "What server are you on?"  He blinked, then allowed that he
didn't know.  Camped out, and found that he was indeed on Drinal, not
FV.  
   Lenny has been playing this game for _over_ a year.  He made this
mistake _this_ morning.
We had a good laugh over this one.
