WTYH and DDD (Dyn's Dizzying Draught) are two of my favorite spells, even at
65.  Great for interrupting Gates and CH's.  It's a 'stun' spell, in that
mobs under it's influence can't cast or attack; but it's in the 'root' line,
not a stun.  Thus, you can interrupt an 'unstunnable' mob so long as it's
not unrootable.

One of the 'hidden gems' of the Enchanter spell line.  Nobody else has a
stun that saves against root.
