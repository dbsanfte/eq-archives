What really annoys me about this is that these changes were made on Test
*two days ago*.  They can't possibly have had time to evaluate the impact of
the changes, yet they go ahead and allow the changes to go live.

As in, guess who gets to find out for himself what it feels like to get
quadded for 5700.  =(

Still, there's a perverse kind of upside to this.  When we killed RZtW, we
did it without using any exploits.  Didn't snare mobs and kite from above,
didn't pull RZtW to the zone, nothin'.  So when we killed him, we did it the
old-fashioned way, with hard work and good execution.  We can take pride in
that, if nothing else.

When we start getting elemental armor, we'll know we did it the hard way,
rather than just farming easy-as-heck mobs.  Yay us - although I have to
admit, I wish we'd done some elemental raids before this patch.  /sigh
