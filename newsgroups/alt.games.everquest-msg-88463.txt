The only dwarf faction the Stein quest lowers is Kazon Stormhammer, and 
the only NPC in that faction is, wait for it, Kazon Stormhammer. I'm in 
the curious situation of being loved by most dwarves, and utterly 
despised by their king. But hey, as far as I'm concerned, he can kiss my 
ass; he's about the right height for it too.

I tried handing in a few bonechips to the Paladins to restore his faction 
after every Stein quest, but I found I just couldn't keep up.
