Beat the drum all you like, that noise alone is hardly sufficient to
convince me.  That your vote was cast for Bush is hardly convincing
evidence the all uncounted ballots were cast for Bush.

Surely you jest?  It looks to me like most political arguments have
considerably less basis than that comparison.  You right-wingers are
little different from the left you know.  When it suits your purpose
you (as a group now, don't take it too personal) will argue relentlessly
that only "official" numbers can be considered (ex: 2000 Census), and
yet here you are demanding that the official numbers be modified for
purposes of argument.  Sorry, but that dog don't hunt worth a damn.
