LOL you guys are like a broken record. I have never *denied* that the game
lacks staying power, I've commented on this *criticism*: there is a
difference, eh?  Unlike some folks, *I* prefer to comment on the things that
I like about games and I spend very little time posting messages about how
bad such-and-such game sucks and debating endlessly with people why they are
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, when they post things about a game that they like. So
fucking sue me. ;-)

I have several major concerns, most of which lead to the criticisms like
David's (which are quite common, I share them). The fact that I continue to
discover fun new content every so often indicates that the devs
are doing a lousy job of making this stuff accessible to us and are killing
their chances. The Tech map is a good example. When people first see it
they're like, wow! It's a small but impactful shift from the repetitive
abandoned warehouse and office themes that fill up the levels between 5-15
or so. And then there's the CoT Lair map around level 27 or so. I
got sidekicked into one the other night with some level 29's and that was
far more of a "wow!" for me. The map is gorgeous, a temple full of pits,
traps and portals, flowing vines and dark covens right out of an Indiana
Jones movie and puts Barindu to absolute shame.  Why on earth aren't the
devs providing more experiences like this more often? /boggle

Anyway, here's a link to a post I made on the official forums voicing some
issues I have with the game: http://tinyurl.com/28znx. As you would imagine,
I'm not alone. This doesn't mean there isn't good quality fun to be had in
these games, and even sustainable, if the fucking devs could get a clue
about how to present this stuff instead of assuming that we're willing to go
through eons of mind-numbing tedium first to see it. Not everyone is like
me! ;-)

And by the way, long term staying power is overrated :P  Personally, I
*like* being able to jump into a new MMOG every six-to-nine months or so.
