My theory is that this is someone spoofing someone elses Email address 
in a deliberate bid to get them treated as a spammer; flooded with hate 
emails, emails to yahoo asking to ban the account, etc.

Could, on the other hand, be a troll, trying to see how many thread 
responses it can get... which is why I left it alone till now, but I 
just couldn't stay out while watching this many responses treating this 
as a serious piece of spam.  Where's the paranoia people?
