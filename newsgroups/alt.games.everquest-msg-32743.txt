Not sure if there is or not.  The tunare symbol is cleric
druid.  Most are just cleric.  I think Cazic and Innorruuk
are Cleric Shaman.  They are primarily for the clerical
classes, so not sure if Karana has cleric worshipers or
not.  I have never played a character worshipping Karana, so
I don't know if that is an option or not.
