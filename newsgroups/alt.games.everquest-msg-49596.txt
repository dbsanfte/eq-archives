Skipping stones are easy to find, just kill a froglok skipper.

You only have to do the shackle quests once. Some do the shackle of clay twice
just to have two shackles for the early levels but IMO you're better off with a
raw silk or cured silk wristband.
It's the shackle of rock that's probably going to cause you the most
frustration. Hunting rare spawns like the Sarnak Courier and a Skulking Brutling
are enough to make you eat your own tail! Still, at the end of it all you do get
the steel shackle which has some nice stats. :)

You could do Shestars(sp?) Coif. He's one of the guards at the entrance to Field
of Bone before you leave Cabilis.
