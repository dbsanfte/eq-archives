 It's practically perma-camped, but the geonids in Crystal Caverns are
great. I can usually make about 200 plat per hour minimum when I can get the
camp...and get XP too (just dinged 49 on them). They drop about 3 or 4 plat,
the big money maker is the jewels...some sell for over 100 plat to vendors.
