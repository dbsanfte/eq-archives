So, if you came across the stuff in a remote location, you would act
differently?

It has nothing to do with pampering idiocy. As I said they were quite
foolish. My point also has nothing to do with suffering fools. It has
to do with suffering thieves.

I completely agree that the person dropping the stuff knows the risks
and deserves no sympathy. That's a lot different, however, than saying
that someone else is right in scooping it up and running. That crap
belongs on the Zek servers.

Would I pick it up? Heck yes. I *would* however, hang around long
enough to see if anyone was coming back for it. Free stuff and a clear
conscience are worth at least that much to me.
