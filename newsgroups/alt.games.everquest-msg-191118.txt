While I agree that sounds like an intereting idea.  The only problems I
could potentially see is that:

1) You would need to carry around an extra weapon at all times, which
could be a pain.

2) What about weapons with level requirements?  Would the epic then see
the stats on that weapon (though it is not useable) and upgrade?  If so,
that could lead to some problems.

3) Say I get the warrior Epic, and am using it 1hs.  I then loot a 1hb
that has better stats then the Epic.  Does the Epic only upgrade to be
better than weapons that are of the same type, or any 1hx or 2hx ?

4) Do stats upgrade as well or is it only the ratio?  What about the proc?
That often determines if something is better or not.
