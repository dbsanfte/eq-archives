   You're not missing much.  I disagreed with something he said, he
categorically stated it was true, I still disagreed, and he decided to
start flaming me for daring to think he might not be right about
everything, at which point I walked away from the original point.  It was
sorta funny really, the original point was of a subtle nature, and if he
had cared to discuss it rather than just start flaming me, I might have
come to see it his way, perhaps.

   Hmmm.  I dunno know about that.  As far as I am concerned, I have no
special privileges or status here.  I mean, I sorta hope I don't.  There
are people here who know much more about the game than I do, who know more
about just about everything I should guess.  If I posted something that was
flat out wrong, I hope I would be corrected on it just the same as everyone
else.

  I am however a long time member of this community, though, and that does
give what I say, I think, a bit more weight than someone who's post count
here is 1.  But there are alot of people who are in that same boat as me. 
One of them being Ben.  In fact, I think he might have been here longer
than me, but I'm not sure about that.  Anyways, the fact that I have
friends here doesn't mean, to me at least, that I am somehow more "right"
than anyone else.
