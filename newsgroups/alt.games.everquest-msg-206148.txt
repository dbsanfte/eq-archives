You're probably screwed. EQ CDs sold on EBay almost certainly have
used CD Keys.

You're probably screwed. If you have a virgin CD key, EQ will give you
30 days free time on a new account, but only once you tell them how
they can bill you after those 30 days expire. It's the same "free"
scam AOL has been running for 15 or so years now.
