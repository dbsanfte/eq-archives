It took me short while to run into Ryshon Huntsi too. But I just poked 
my head into WK at his posted spawn point once or twice a day 
(real-time) for about a week and found him after 4 or 5 days.

You might want to park an alt near his spawn point and just login and 
take a peek to see if he's up, from time to time.

I didn't do anything to trigger him, but that doesn't mean he isn't 
triggered.
