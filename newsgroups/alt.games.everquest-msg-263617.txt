If he's making 100k, he's paying more than 28% on a large chunk of
that income. 28% was more than fair for him to use.  Meanwhile, you
are still forgetting lots of other taxes.  For one, the FICA he sees
is only half of what his employer pays to hire him, so that 7.75% is
more like double that amount.  And what happened to state income
taxes?  What about luxury taxes, gasoline taxes, sin taxes, various
other excise taxes, property taxes, unemployment insurance taxes?

7.1% of the federal budget.  Interestingly, much less than in
2000...when it was 12.5%

Define military waste.  Is that military spending, period?  So cut
military spending 1% you mean?

We spent $405 billion on defense last year.

We spent $1.18 trillion on entitlement programs last year.  Even if
you cut out Social Security, we still spent nearly double our military
budget on entitlements including Medicaid, Disability insurance, and
TANF (what we usually call welfare).

Your debt can actually grow in size and yet become less of a burdon. 
We spent 1.4% of GDP on interest on the debt last year.  This is the
lowest it has been, in terms of GDP (i.e. our ability to bear the
burden of the debt) since 1973.  The debt grows but so does our
ability to service the debt.  (It also helps to have lower interest
rates...)

Those employers are innovating, reinventing, investing, and constantly
rethinking this economy.  Despite what you may think, the rich become
so because they create much more value than the line worker.  What
represents more value: manual labor that creates 100 gadgets worth $50
each to the consumer?  ...or new shipping techniques that save $1 on
the cost to build and distribute each gadget for 10,000,000 gadgets?

People who start out their career earning 20k rarely end their career
also making (an inflation adjusted) $20,000.  Or did you think that
the guy carrying shingles up a ladder to the roofers will just do that
same exact job for 50 years?
