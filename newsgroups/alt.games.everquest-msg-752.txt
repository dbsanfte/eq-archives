People want to solo in MMORPG's for many reasons. People usually say "Why
the hell would you want to solo in an online game??"

Perhaps people get bored of grouping and want to solo on occaisions for a
change of venue?

Perhaps, people get tired of dying in lame groups, because of some
newb_idiot that can't pull or something?

Perhaps, other people, like the social aspects of a guild, and guild raids,
but for the most part, want to hunt/gain exp solo?

One of the best games ever made, "Meridian59", had no grouping system at
all.  But the sense of community in that game was astounding.  To a level
which Everquest hasn't come close to.

There are many reasons someone might want to solo in a MMORPG.

Lastly, I think many people keep going in EQ with the thought that one-day,
they will be a god.  That lowly level 2 necromancer sees a level 60 necro
with a spectre pet, and thinks "When I get that powerful, nothing can touch
me."

Thats the myth of EQ.  What that necro doesn't realize is when he gets that
level, the things he's killing now won't matter, and the things he needs to
kill will destroy the 60th necro in 2.3 seconds.  Thats the myth that
everyone falls into when they buy EQ.

You suck at level 1, and lotsa stuff can kill you quickly.  You suck at
level 60, and lotsa stuff can kill you quickly.
