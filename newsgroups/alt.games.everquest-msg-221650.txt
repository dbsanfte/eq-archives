If we have any room to work, we never let our ranger tank - that's a job
for my pet so the ranger can use his bow :-P  

An artifact of having a Stonewood Compound bow, but just Swiftwind and
14/21 axe

(Although, if I can convince our AM raid force to take Yelinak once a
week - he has a shot at Gauntlets of Dragon slaying so he can replace
SW soon - plus he just won a 14/18 sword from the Ice boss in BoT today)
