I'm an enchanter, and I've played a lot with others, so, since not evil,

Enchanter and Paladin: You get heals, haste, clarity, tanking, slowing
etc...
Enchanter and Ranjah: My Ranjah friend and I are the Fear Kiting Dynamic
Duo.
Enchanter and Cleric: Not as good, but you've got 2/3rds of the perfect 3
man group there.
Enchanter and Druid: Similar to the Ranjar, fear kiters are us. In the right
places dual charmies are nice.
Enchanter and Beastlord may have possibilities... not sure though (fraid I
don't group with enough bsts)
I'd say Enchanter Monk, but everytime I've duo'd E-M it's been with a real
well equipped Iksar. Don't know how a human without really good gear would
do. Still couldn't hurt to try.

An enchanter may be any race. You get illusion half elf which will get you
into any 'good' town at level 4 or 8, assuming you don't have diety faction
issues, say worshiper of Berty.

My Personal Race Preferences for enchanter:
Dark Elf <-- Dead sexah, and I get UV unless I have to illusion. Really I
have very few faction probs as agnostic
Gnome <-- Fear the Small!!
Erudite <--I don't care at this point, and am going for best stats
Human
High Elf <--Well... except I hate high elves. This has nothing to do with
playing a dark elf, I just can't stand em.
If I just cared about stats I'd probable go Erudite or High Elf.
