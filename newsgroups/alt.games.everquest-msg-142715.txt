I started out playing a druid.  Loads of fun for a while, but by the
mid-40s I'd basically seen and done everything a druid could do.
Soloing was boring, and in groups/raids I was relegated to
occasionally casting weak nukes and heals. I envied the melees who
were always in the thick of things contributing something useful.  So
I made a rogue.  Had fun levelling him up too, but now that he is 55 I
have again lost interest in playing.  I mean what is there really to
do in the game...

XPing: Pre-51 levelling went fairly fast, and you could make half a
level in a couple of hours after work.  Seeing yourself noticably
improve every day was addictive.  At 55, XP barely moves - and that is
if I can even find a group, what with the shortage of clerics and
enchanters.  Few people would claim XPing is fun though, because the
payoff is supposed to be in...

Raiding: This is fun?  An hour waiting for enough people to log in and
get a port.  Another hour assigning groups and moving out. A few hours
messily fighting your way to the boss mob with 40 people. 5 minutes
spent actually fighting the mob (of which your individual contribution
is negligible) immediately followed by 1+ hours to recover from the
wipeout. Repeat until mob dead or you give up.  Still you figure it's
worth it for the...

Loot: This seems to cause more strife and guild breakups than
anything.  And for what?  Stuff that makes little difference to your
character, no one cares you're wearing, and will always be mediocre
relative to everyone else.  Which must be why folks say "loot isn't
important, friends are" - in fact the hours of raid downtime should be
fun because you spend it...

Socializing: Chatting with a random collection of people that
realistically you barely know is fun?  Most are teens half your age,
talking in the latest l33t street slang which you have no clue about. 
Playing with real-life friends might be enjoyable, but EQ friendships
are mostly bogus.  I guess the type of folks who frequent internet
chat rooms enjoy this.

Er, so what exactly is fun about the 50+ game?
