Try to avoid starting with just "hi" and waiting for a response.  My wife
gets asked for rezes often and both of us find it annoying when she gets a
mysterious "hi" from a stranger then a pause.  Also, don't assume that the
bard or necro is just standing around doing nothing.  Something like, "I'm
sorry to bother you, but I need help locating a corpse in XYZ zone.  Can you
help me?", could be effective.
