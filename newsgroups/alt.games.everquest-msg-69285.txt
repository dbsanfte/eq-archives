At your level you are pretty safe believing the con messages.  At 44, I am
finding more and more blues that I cannot take down reliably.  If I get just
one or two extra resists, that is the difference between killing the mob or
having to zone.  I also find blues that are pretty trivial to take down.  I
have not run into a green that I could not handle so long as I have a decent
amount of mana.
