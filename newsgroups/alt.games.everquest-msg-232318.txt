Sadly, if you're in pickup groups, this will happen to you.  The Rotation
idea doesn't work - there simply isn't TIME.  As a bard, in an LDON I'm
either beating on something, pulling, or keeping a mob mezzed - and
sometimes two of the list at once.  I don't have the time to stop and loot!
Do you want a break in pulls every six mobs so I can loot something?  Didn't
think so.

Similarly, the MT is beating on something nonstop (it's my job to make sure
of it!) and doesn't have time to loot either.  The healer is probably
medding (or should be), etc.

The group can afford one person, perhaps two, to do looting.  It can't
afford for everyone to take the time in rotation - that's the path to
failure.
