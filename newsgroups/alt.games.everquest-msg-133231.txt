 What's funny is FoH said they'd be selling power sources to other
guilds once PoP was released. Look for his thread about shard griefers
or whatever.

 The ONLY reason he doesn't like this is because if a guild on Veeshan
did take up the offer, it would interfere with FoHs uncontested VT
farming that they presently enjoy. Otherwise I don't see a difference.
