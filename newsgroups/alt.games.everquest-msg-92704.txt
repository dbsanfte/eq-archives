Ok, short update: Yesternight I got 5 glowing worm biles within 3 hours,
by just wiping the plains with my new roxorsthegame spell Insidious
Retrogression (~550 initial nuke AND 90second snare about as good
as Dooming Darkness).
Two friends (around level 40) helped me and got decent xp during the
time, for the sheer speed we took them down.

So let me state again: The glowing Wurm thing (Once I was pretty sure
the wurm was glowing it did indeed have a bile, the point is, I am almost
ALWAYS sure they glow lol) is maybe useful for lower levels, up to 45
maybe, were you can't take them out as they spawn. But at level 51 I
can solo dominate the southern plain and have my pet finish em off
often ending the fight with more pet health then it started, since the pet
actually gets the benefiting effect of its lifetaps (recent patch).

Oh well - went to Velks, actually got into a Frenzy Group after a while,
got a Ring of the Frost Spiders as a present from the group while I hadn't
joined them yet, got my silk threads and 4 blue bubs in 51 plus TWO of
the less common Velious Quest Armor Gems...
And this time I suceeded on the final combine :)

Hmm... smiley would have helped, actually believed you were serious :)
