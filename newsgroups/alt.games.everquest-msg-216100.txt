Actually, I put 1 point in each specialty, and trained the one I wanted 
up to the 40s, then just cast normally, and ended up specialized in 
Alteration.  Not that I am complaining that it ended up being alteration, 
but, just saying that you really have to be extremely careful as a 
shaman, if alteration is not the one you want.  More so than many other 
classes, as the one spell that a shaman casts a lot, and yet is not 
helped at all by specialization, is an alteration based spell.
