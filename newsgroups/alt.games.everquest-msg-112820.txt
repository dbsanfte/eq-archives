Waist - Braided Cinch Cord - LGuk Sage
Arms - Gatorscale Sleeves - UGuk Ancient Croc
Legs - Drake Hide Leggings - SolA Bartender
Feet - I'd go with Kobold Boots (SolA Predator) or Wolf Fur Slippers 
(Perma Scryer) - Both add mana - Offhand I can't think of any good, easy 
to get and/or cheap to buy int or chr feet
Shoulders - My chanter is wearing the 4th coldain shawl, but that's a 
shameless twink on my part. Don't know what else you might get for this 
slot either.
