While there are always some people who will abuse it,
what Bizbee fails to realize is that most of the
repetitive "falls to the ground" messages are from
Monks practicing their skill to raise it (since
there's no other way to do so), which won't be a
problem from the "recreational fainters".

I can't see people spamming an area with /faint emotes
any more often than any other animated emote.  And
yeah that happens at times, but not very often.
