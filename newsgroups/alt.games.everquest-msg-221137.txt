PS. I have the choice available to me to *choose* to have a vasectomy. 
There is no projection, because if I actually had any real worries about
getting my wife pregnant again I would probably go ahead and get one. 
Another element of responsibility is knowing what you can handle, and one
kid is plenty for me.  There is no castration involved in "fixing" a human.

Was a rather weak attempt at armchair psychology.  Here, let me show you how
it's done.

It's interesting that you capitalize "Fear" and "Castration" while bringing
up your projection theory.  One could safely assume that your post about
projection was in actuality your own projection.  And then your comment
about pets "minding a lot more not being allowed to go out and use their
reproductive organs" has the flavor of personal experience ("a lot" is very
personally subjective and generally only used by people in relating things
to themselves).  Do I detect an inadequacy or impotency problem?  You
should see a doctor, there are many wonderful cures beyond the classic
Viagra these days.
