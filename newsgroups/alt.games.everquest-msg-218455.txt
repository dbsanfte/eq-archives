Paladin can make himself useful.  Warrior's value is heavily dependent
both on how the rest of the group plays and on how well the rest of the
group plays.  Simple example:
A Paladin pulling in LDoN group that includes a Warrior.  Paladin uses
a stun or two early to hold agro until mob is slowed, Warrior taunts
mob off Paladin as soon as slow lands (well, as soon as he can anyway).
Both Warrior and Paladin stay in front of mob so pets and other melee
get back, and Warrior's kicks help keep mob from being pushed all over
hell and back by the others (I'm gonna make a hotkey threatening severe
bodily harm to the next BL or Ranger who creates an unnecessary add by
shoving a mob into a pacified mob nearby).  Paladin heads out for next
pull when mob is around 30%.
In one group where we worked it like that the Warrior was 2 levels
higher than my Paladin and had better gear, so even tho he did most of
the tanking I needed more healing than he did (of course, he was only
tanking slowed mobs, which also helps).  It was a "slaughter" mission
we completed in under an hour despite having a relatively low DPS
group.  Having a Warrior "leapfrog" my Paladin's position on the
hate list via Taunt seems to work well for avoiding caster agro.
