Hi,

Is anybody else having trouble locating a copy of PoP in the UK?  Every shop 
I've tried in Manchester and Leicester doesn't seem to have had it for weeks 
now.  All the mail order/online suppliers I've tried are out of stock and 
say it could be weeks before they get any more copies due to Ubisoft (UK) 
being the absolute pits to deal with (apparently).

Just wondered if anybody was having trouble locating a copy....

Ian
