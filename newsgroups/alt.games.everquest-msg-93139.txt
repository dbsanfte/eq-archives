Hi,

Thanks for the information regarding my account key problem.

The message that I get is that I haven't entered the account key properly
and not that the account key is in use.

As for the font, it actually looks pretty clear to me which is so
infuriatting, I could understand it if some of the letters and numbers
weren't very clear but they look very clear indeed.

I've taken a snap of the label just in case I'm asked for it, thanks for
suggesting that as I would never have thought of that. The label itself has
"EVERQUEST KUNARK" in what I would describe as a bold font with the 11 digit
number in a normal font.

Thanks again for your help, at least I know that I'm looking at what appears
to be the right number.

Derek
