One of the funniest things I've ever seen in a discussion group
was a football site that had a forum with a badword filter.
Instead of just censoring the bad words with [censored] or
"#@!#$%," it replaced them with the names of football players
(and in most cases very appropriately).  For example you might
read a post such as this; "You know that son of a Randy Moss
can't throw the ball worth Gilbert Brown.  I hate the Brett
Favreing Steelers!"
