Sorry to follow up my own post, but one point I forgot to make was that I 
have always considered it a bad sign when, say, leather padding is selling 
for 20 to 30pp on a server. Wouldn't that indicate that the economy there 
is wacked and there is just too much money floating around on that server 
if people are paying that much? I mean, it's not like the spiderling silks 
and skins are difficult or take much time to farm.
