Nationalism, fascism, territorialism, quaint notions of
national sovereignty, broken treaties, self defense, beliefs
in liberty and self-determination, defense pacts, outrage over
transparent lies, revulsion against racism, protection of 
the innocent -- the list goes on.

To say that it was only about "pure" economics is...  puerile.

Try cracking a history book sometime.  Or talk to someone who
was alive then.

Are you a Marxist, by any chance?  You share their weirdly
tunnel-visioned fixation on trying to interpret *everything* in
terms of economics, denying all other factors.
