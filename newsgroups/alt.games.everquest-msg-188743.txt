Get yourself a green ceramic ring, will cast strike (IIRC) on command
from inventory, that way you don't have to devote a slot to a nuke,
pluss having a mana free nuke can be usefull even if it is only 20
points or so.

Personally I think the best puller is an enchanter.  Nothing like having
a tashed slowed mob mezed and waiting for your tank to beat on when they
are ready.

Remember Bards, and Paladins also get the lull line and make better meat
shields than a cleric...

I have pulled quite a bit with my cleric in groups because the tanks
can't do it right. 

Even thought lots of people in seem to like to rely on monks, I find it
highly annoying. I remember once playing my enchanter, a monk took like
5 minutes to pull just one thing in karnors.  I was used to dealing with
large numbers there, and sitting around waiting for him to "break" up
the pull while everyone was at FM was extremely annoying.
