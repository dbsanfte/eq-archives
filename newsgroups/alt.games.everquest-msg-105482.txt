No they didnt believe it then even though we said it loud and hard. It was
no less true then either. Druids after level 35 or so are and always where
completely broken. It was pointed out many times but eventually the decent
druids give up and start a diffrent character. We now have the ridiculous
situation of where 1/10th of the people thought the concept of a druid was
really nifty and started one, these days you will be lucky to find 1/50th of
the high end population as a druid. The rest gave up and left, or switched
characters.
