Here is a question for anyone to help with input on (since I've always
wondered, and this is a good time to bring it up).

Can one get into trouble (legally?) for claiming to be an employee
representing a company and giving inside information (or just claiming that
they do/have) if this is not true?  Something like impersonating a police
officer or similar charges?

The headers of his post show his IP address.
His ISP should have record of who has that address.
Therefore they should know who he is.
And then Sony can do what they want about the situation. (good or bad, it's
their choice)

Am I right about this?  If not, then what parts are incorrect, and what are
the corrections of them?  I'd like to know (as others may too).
