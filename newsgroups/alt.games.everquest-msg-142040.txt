I was talking about exp groups.  Solo fine on undead? check out the mana to
dmg ratio, even worse are the resists rates on cleric undead dd's.  Far less
mana effiecient than a druids dd and dot's that work on anything and no
snare.  And how many good soloable undead spots are there in the game?

Rogues can solo well at level 60, especially backstabbing casters when they
are casting along with chaotic frontal backstab.  Outdoors work on instill
doubt and get a SBD snare and fear backstab.

Warriors can solo pretty well if equipped right.  I soloed my warrior about
70% of the way to level 57.  Truncheon of doom is 50% slow and if your lucky
enough to have a fungi and switch to 2 bloodpoints after Truncheon processes
soloing for a warrior becomes trivial.
