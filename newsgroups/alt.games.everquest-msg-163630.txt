The get the Lull line, if not the area version. It's better than the grilled
cheese sammich's they had to pull with before.

Hmmm players get nervous when their clerics and enchanters pull... dunno
why. ;P

Pulling enchanter soloable xp mobs at level 52, I'm averaging about 1 resist
in 30 overall. Usually it's been a oh @#$% here comes the camp resist. I
don't get to use it much in groups... except to pacify things we can't
handle that are wandering up (preemptive CC)

I used to use it as best I could do with the 'old' pacify in a few Kael
raids I was on, because we had a shaman to debuff, another enchanter that
wanted to tash and dot (and 1 level higher than me), and my charms for CC
were getting me creamed because my groups healer was a PALADIN. Oh yeah, the
druids kept cracking jokes (oooh the enchanter nuked! chain nuke or he's
gonna KS us guys)!
That was annoying btw: 40 more points of Chr that the other enchanter, same
charm, she would charm something for 10 min, I never had a charm last
through a fight. Got 11 rezzes that day. the RNG was not happy with me.

I expect the nerf bat, but can they really make the spell worse than it
already was?
