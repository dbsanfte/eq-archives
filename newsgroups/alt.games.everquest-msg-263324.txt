But it seems like it will still allow you to traverse the wilds if you want 
or need to--just sounds to me like it doesn't force you into mind-numbing 
travel if you don't.  And after experiencing CoH, this is a very good thing, 
as far as I'm concerned.

This travel issue in these games is by itself a make or break issue for me.
