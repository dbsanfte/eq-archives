Like I said.. BTDT

Your response was to attack me personally, rather than attacking the
logic of the post..

Ergo, everyone can only assume that you DON'T have any response,
therefore you simply resort to personal attacks on the author, instead
of trying to attack the rational of the post, which you have obviously
proven that you cannot...
