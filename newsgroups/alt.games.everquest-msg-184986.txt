I use an indestructictible keyboard for my PS2.  It looks kind of silly 
but it's functional.  No real problems with it, don't have to punch the 
keys hard or anything like that, it does have a different feel than a 
regular keyboard but you get used to it.
I have a regular keyboard for my computer. I bought a cover for it as 
soon as I bought it, this is the 3rd keyboard I had to buy because of 
spills and crumbs.  When I got this keyboard, I went to Office Depot, 
they sell keyboard covers, you actually buy a piece of paper to fill out 
with your keyboard's specs, once you do that you get a cover that fits 
your keyboard perfectly.  Haven't had any problems with the cover since 
we bought it except I think the two-sided tape needs replacing, we've 
had it for going on a year now.
