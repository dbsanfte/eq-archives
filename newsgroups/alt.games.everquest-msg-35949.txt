Since it's dropping posts like mad I'll assume you didn't read the 
original post.  NEVER did I get up and scream about what my gender 
preference was.  I started out by posting an anecdote about something I 
was having double problems with and the reply made by one person was rude 
and obviously written by someone who hadn't read my post, but had only 
skimmed it, then went running into the newsgroup to call someone a 'fag'.   
If that kind of post deserves respect, I'd rather lick a troll's hand 
(the one he scratches with).
