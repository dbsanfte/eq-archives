I have a similar system set up for spell casting (my main is an
Enchanter) where I have the 8 spell gems on hotkey bank 8 so that I can
just press the number key to cast. Combined with remapping some of the
movement and targetting keys to the top left qwerty keys I can do most
things without needing the mouse which is faster, more efficient and 
safer.

For instance, when I'm charming something and the charm breaks all I
need to do is press the ` key (next to 1) to stand up, press the Q key
to target the nearest mob (my ex-pet which is now charging at me) and
then 3 (to cast my AoE stun). I then press S (to walk backwards a few
steps) and then finally 8 to cast spell 8 which is where I drop the
charm spell. Result, ex-pet is recharmed almost immediately and before
he can do much damage to me at all.

Mouse-clicking is just soooooo slow in comparison ;)
