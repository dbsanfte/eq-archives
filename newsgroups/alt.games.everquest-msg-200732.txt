I have been crashing a lot during fights since I upgraded my system to 1 gig
of memory.  Here is what I have installed:

Pentium 4 2.2 gig
2 512 meg sticks of DDR 2100 memory
ABIT BD7 Raid Motherboard
Geforce4 TI 4200 with 128 megs of memory
Sound Blaster Audigy
Windows XP Pro with SP 1
DirectX 9.0a (yes, I upgraded after the help I had from this board)
Latest Nvidia drivers

I have run stress tests on the CPU and complete memory tests on the DDR
memory.  I can never get windows to crash while doing this.  I have run
3DMark 2001 SE in a loop mode for over four hours without any crashes.  I
turn all the particle effects down and the clip plane down to 60%.  Still, I
have been crashing fairly regularly during fighs in DL.  I do not know if
this is the ase for other zones since DL is ideal for my level.

My question is has anyone here upgraded their system to 1 gig of memory and
seen Everquest start to crash more frequently?  Needless to say this is
really pissing me off.  No other program is crashing due to the added
memory.
