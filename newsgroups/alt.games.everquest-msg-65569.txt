I have an Elsa GeForce2 GTS Pro (64mb ddr) and can say that, with the
exception of some issues with motherboard driver compatibility (a
known issue with AMD chipsets, long since fixed) this card, and this
company, are impeccable.  Finding one in your $150 range might be a
little difficult, as this is the high end card in the GeForce 2
line... the GTS2 32mb and GTS64mb boards (the standard models) come in
a little cheaper, and outperform the 'newer' mx models by a long
shot... and the pro even goes equal with/very close to the GF3 cards
in some benchmarks... there are some things the pro can't do that the
gf3 can, but as of now, nobody seems to be using these features...

Companies I have heard good things about or done business with:

Elsa - IMO opinion, the cream of the crop.   Excellent, rock solid
product, built with grade a materials, and tech support par none.
They got me through a lot of issues that made EQ unplayable because of
AMD chipset problems...  and an excellent website as well.

Hercules (surprise surprise surprise) - they are an excellent
manufacturer in their own right, and, surprisingly, an excellent OEM
as well.

PNY (never used one of their video cards, but the rest of their
product line has always done well by me)

Have never heard any bad, per se, about any OEM's, but I tend to make
it a point to try to stick with either well known or highly rated
smaller companies.  Makes things safer.

And for future consideration, try to find a card that truly supports
the DDR it carries, like the GTS line... it does make a difference.
