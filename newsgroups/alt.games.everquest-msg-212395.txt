 From L1 to L19 the trolls and iksar I've played had 2/tick standing
regen and 4/tick sitting.  Starting at L20 they've have 2/tick standing
and 6/tick sitting (i.e. exactly double normal regen).  Now I have not
played any of these to 50 or higher, but it is my understanding that
their regen continues to be double that of other races (i.e. 2 standing
and 8 sitting at 50, 4 standing and 10 sitting at 51+, don't know what
levels you get additional bumps to "natural" regen).  AA regen for
trolls and iksar was originally double that of other races also, but
SOE pronounced that to be a mistake and nerfed it (and refunded the AA
points after the resulting outcry).  Anyhow, it's not +4, it's double,
which scales with level the same as for everybody else.

Actually, it takes 15 ticks to regen 60hp for a L1 to L19 troll.

Um, not constant, double normal, scales with level...

All your arguments about other means of regen overwhelming natural
regen still apply, but even the puny 3/tick extra from 20 thru 49
can be very helpful to a non-twink, at least in my experience.  For
a class that sits most of the time, and yet consumes HP (grouped
24+ Shaman, grouped Necro whenever they get their first hp->mana
conversion), that's gonna be nearly 1800 extra hp per hour.  For a
ghetto SK working without a healer (long ago I used to partner a
warrior with an iksar SK) it improves your sustainable kill-rate.
But yeah, for a twink with a regen item it isn't gonna mean much.
