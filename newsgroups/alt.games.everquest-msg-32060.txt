Ive been unemployed because of non everquest reasons since may. sold
my only everquest-capable computer before then because I was playing
too much. I now wish I was joining you in monster-bashing and dungeon
raiding. I have had too much time on my hands and no money to buy
another pc with a 3d card. is the game still as fun as it was last
year?
