Your maturity amazes me.  Or lack thereof, of coures.

"Point of order,"  nice analogy.  You come to our newsgroup, say hi to your
homies and then toss out an implied threat first thing.

You are not welcome here.   You will not get help from many of the regulars.
EQ is designed for adults, and it's obvious that you do not belong in that
group of people.

You are as welcome here as your little friends.  You are welcome to play EQ
and curse in public channels and kill steal from other newbies and you are
welcome to call them "fucking n00bs."

You are welcome to continue paying Verant $9.89/mo for a game in which the
majority of the players will take one look at your "argue first, think
second" attitude and they will look for someone to replace you in their
group.   You are welcome to (and should) created a necro for they do not
need to make friends for many many levels, and hopefully by the time you hit
that level you will have matured (but not likely).

Here's a clue:  "Don't fuck with me and I won't fuck with you" is GUARANTEED
to piss off a lot of people.  THAT is a THREAT.  People don't reply well to
threats.

You are a newsgroup bully.   What does that mean?  Nothing at all...ng
bullies are pathetic.  They think they're important but in fact they're a
polish joke...confusing that word with impotent.

As all the kids are saying nowadays:  You ARE the weakest link goodbye.
