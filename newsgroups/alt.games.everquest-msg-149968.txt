If it kills just the cleric, fair lesson.  Its when the aggro pulled mobs

come in and wipe the whole raid that this is a problem.  Since
you are doing this under controlled circumstances, I assume you
have a "sufficient to kill the cleric and not the rest of the raid"
pull coming in, and I say go for it.
