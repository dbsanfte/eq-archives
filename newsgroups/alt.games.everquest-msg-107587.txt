    The Al'Kabor line isn't intended to be used when soloing (and if it was,
it's a failure). It was intended to be a big nuke in terms of area covered -
if you play with it you'll see that it can actually hit targets that are
pretty far apart. That doesn't make it useful to you, or pretty much anyone,
but it does have that property.

    And that's why it REALLY sucks. Harry Potter nukes harder than Al'Kabor.

    Did you ever play with your rain spell at level 4 or 12? Here's how they
work:

    Target a mob, cast the rain spell. The first "wave" will come down in a
fairly tight pillar around the targetted critter, hitting up to four mobs.
If you hit four things, the second and third waves do nothing. If you hit
less than four targets, when the second wave comes a few seconds later (all
waves come down in the same spot), it will hit up to four targets - but the
maximum number of times the spell will deal damage is four. A few quick
examples:

1) You have four mobs in a tight pattern, and Energy Storm them. The first
wave hits all four. The second and third waves do nothing.
2) You have three mobs in a tight pattern, and Energy Storm them. The first
wave hits all three. If they're still in the same spot when the second wave
hits, one of them will take damage and the other two won't. The third wave
does nothing.
3) (This is a typical mage rain.) You have two mobs in front of you fighting
the pet. You cast a rain on them. The first wave hits both. One runs out of
the rain to kill you, the other stays in place to fight the pet. The one
fighting the pet will eat two more waves of damage.

    The only other thing to know about Rain spells is this: if a wave would
get the killshot on a mob, it will be resisted in full. It's something to do
with unattributed damage poofing corpses. It will still "use up" one of your
four chances to deal damage, though.

> the target?

    No. Many casters have been eaten by mobs that wander under the rain
after it's been cast.

    You want to stick with your column AoEs - they're best for quadding. For
now, keep using Column of Lightning. At 34 you'll get Circle of Force and
the fun will begin. :-)
