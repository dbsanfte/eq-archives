No, the approach used by Verant is the same one police use...

"Did you recognize the attacker"

"Did anyone know you were going to be out alone carrying $5000 Cash in
unmarked bills"

"Why were you walking alone through Times Square carrying $5000 Cash in
Unmarked bills"

Etc.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
