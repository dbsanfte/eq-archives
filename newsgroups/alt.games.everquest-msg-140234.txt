I truly hate the xp grind.. 54 is a struggle.. I hate it..

There is an insanely extreme difference after 51.. Yes.. 51 is a hell
level.. but i really think 51+ is all hell levels..

Thats why i have an alt.. to hear the ding sound once more.. lol.. Try to
keep him under 30.. then start a new one.. play it when you throw up too
much of boredom from xp camping :)
