Yeah it always amazed me how much MORE I learned about other classes when I
started a new one.  It's become much less now but I still learn new things
by playing new classes.

Combining this topic and the next into one, yeah, at very low levels mana
will be much more useful than INT items (assuming you're not talking about a
Stein of Moggok or something else with high INT) and yeah, AC can be
semi-important.  I don't think it does nearly as much good on a caster than
a meleer, but I might be wrong.  I, personally, would much rather have a
couple of gold (or better) fire opal rings than AC, INT OR mana until level
16 or so. :)
