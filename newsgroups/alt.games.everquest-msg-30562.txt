Have you been reading the thread?  I'm not quite sure how to explain it
better, but I'll try.  It seems that some quest related NPCs are very
serious underconns.  They will con green to you, so you attack, and promptly
have your ass handed to you.  There was a suggestion that this was to
discourage players killing these NPCs, which seems reasonable.  The problem
is, that you don't necessarily know they are quest NPCs before you attack
them.  Hopefully, you do learn from your mistake.  An example or two of
these NPCs was presented in the thread.  I think that about covers it.
