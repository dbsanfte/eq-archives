Well ram may be cheap in the states but here in sweden it is not, well
not that cheap.

256 MB PC2100 DDR around $80+
512 MB PC2100 DDR around $200+

Shure that might be considered cheap if your last name is Gates..

And i also feal that because memory is cheap it doesen't mean that
programming should be sloppy, what if there will be an EQ2 will that
one require 1GB ram?, no problem ram is cheap :)
