LoL glad to have made your day, and nope not upset any more either, it
will amount to little ( on the monk possibly) or I just find another
game. To be honest there's lots of them out there but leave it to yall
to find what suits ya so I cant be accused of trolling for some other
game company.

Kinda like the job I lost only to only find a better one I wouldn't
have found if I hadn't been "downsized"  by the local corporate
as...errr manager..

And BTW the arse that laid me off from my last job is still living in
that hell factory trading ulcers for paychecks while I am free enough
to enjoy a game or two.

Have a great day :)
