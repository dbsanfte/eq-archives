It's wrong to expect it and wrong to think that NBG is a better system
than giving everyone a chance to profit from an XP group. People don't
need things they can buy any less than they do things that they can
win.

Example 1: Level 52 Monk_01 wants to camp the Tranquil Staff and asks
Level 60 Shaman_02, who is LFG and who he doesn't know, to join him at
the camp. Shaman_02 was going to spend the time soloing in Sebilis to
save money for a copy of Malo that's on sale for 70k. OTOH, if he can
sell a TStaff, he'll have enough to buy the spell and help his
fledgeling guild do new encounters that they couldn't do without Malo.
If he stays in OS and grinds away, Monk_01 has no chance of getting
his TStaff. If he agrees to go on the condition that he be allowed to
roll on the TStaff, giving up his opportunity to farm thousands of
plat from NG, is he somehow a bad guy?

Similarly, if a group in Plane of Valor (where the only decent loot is
spell parchments) is looking for someone to add serious DPS and asks a
high-level rogue who was on his way to Nurga to build Chardok faction
and raise plat to buy a Horn of Hsgara to come and contribute to their
group, is it unreasonable to ask for an equal chance at loot drops or
at least some sort of compensation for *not* rolling on spells?

Specifically, in the second situation, the caster's mafia was out in
full force. The group organizer was the cleric and he'd dictated that
only he, the enchanter, and the shaman could roll for parchments. When
I suggested that, in return for forgoing rolls on the parchment drops,
perhaps the rolls for claws and metallic liquid should be melee only.
In a grand display of missing the point, the leader said, "Those rings
have mana," then got in a snit for about a half an hour about what a
greedy fuck I was.

Pickup groups work best when everyone has the same amount to gain in
them. Otherwise, you wind up in a position where you're either asking
or demanding that strangers do you favors, giving up their own
pursuits in-game to help with yours.
