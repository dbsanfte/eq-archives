1) Yup, someone mentioned the big one you'd most likely get flamed for (and
you're guilty of it, but I don't really care...mistakes out of ignorance
don't bother me).  Top posting.

Top posting is the norm in LOTS of newsgroups, but not this one.

2) Don't be afraid to use that Block feature on people who seem to be a
waste of time.  You're using OE6, so you'd just highlight the subject line,
then click on Message >> Block Sender.

If you really want to go crazy (I did, when I first found the feature) with
message board rules, you can block messages with certain words/phrases in
the subject line.  I used to block anything with "fuck," "wtf," (both are
just whiners), or any class that I wasn't interested in playing (back when a
LOT of the talk was the world finding out about classes, back in '99).
