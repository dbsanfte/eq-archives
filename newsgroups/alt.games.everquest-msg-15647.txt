Oh, I understand that. The lengthy titles were a bit of mock bombast.

Exactly my assumption and exactly the response I expected. Like the folks
who insist on "/shout DING level 7!"ing, the idea that somebody would want
to do that is rather odd to me. I feel no urge to tell people that I've
decided to quit a game and for the life of me cannot fathom why somebody
else would. I imagine Larry does not want to answer because it *was* a vent
for venting's sake and he is not too inclined to admit as much, for whatever
reason.

No matter. I've grown rather tired of the subject, and seeing as it is
developing into something it was not intended to be, I shall let it lie. My
preconceived notions of those folks who choose to announce their decision to
quit a game will remain unless I am directed otherwise by one of the folks
in question.
