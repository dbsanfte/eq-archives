First of all, EQ *isn't* the game for me, I quit over a year ago :)
Secondly, I used an exaggerated example. How many times you have 
something else planned (outside of EQ), but you end up staying in the 
game cause you HAVE to stay for the CR?

I don't think buying a coffin is a viable option starting at level 1. 
Actually if I remember correctly, buying coffins hurt my pocket even at 
level 48. The only good part about it was that it was fun as hell to go 
buy a coffin as an iksar monk :)

In EQ they are. In DAOC they're not necessary at all. I thought that's 
what this thread was about

Wow, he did? A lot must have changed in the last year. I've had my

Yup. That's why I like the con/exp penalty in DAOC too. However, in DAOC 
you don't lose levels/abilities
