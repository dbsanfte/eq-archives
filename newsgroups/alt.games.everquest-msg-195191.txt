That is what they do, approximately, for some maintenance.  (I say
approximately because they do several servers at once).  What you have
overlooked is that many patches involve a *client* update as well as a
server update.

In a maintenance rotation, when would you suggest they do the client update?
Suppose I play on two servers.  At some point, under your suggetion, one
would be updated, and one would not.  If my client has not yet updated, I
could not play on the updated server.  If my client has updated, I could not
play on the un-updated server.
