The implementation of mounts in EQ is really bizarre. A lot of people can
faster than their mount, they certainly fight better without a mount, a
mount can't fight, you can't charge with a lance and skewer someone, and it
forces you to finish off casting spells although the lightest tap of a level
1 fish can interrupt your spells. Perhaps people should just use a mouse on
a string... when they need to interrupt the spell, they tug the string, and
the mouse's vicious nip stops the spell!

Mounts have plenty of in game limits, there is no game balance reason
whatsoever for them to have that one, and there's no logic to it anyway.
That's one thing I miss about pen and paper games, steeds were combat
enhancers, not mobile deck chairs.
