He doesn't seem quite so annoying any more. I started a new character 
and he didn't seem to say that quite so much. Maybe they fixed something.

4 weeks until release seems reasonable to me.  It's basically finished 
and working. There are bugs and thing that need tweaking but 4 weeks 
plus the first few weeks of live will see that sorted out.
The game was great fun several weeks ago when I first got into beta and 
they've added and fixed a ton of stuff since then.

I can't wait for it to launch so I can play properly.
