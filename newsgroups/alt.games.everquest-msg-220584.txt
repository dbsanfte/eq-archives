I would guess that the mob isn't able to be angered by sitting whilst 
mezzed.  Once the mob wakes up, it realises someone had the audacity to 
sit down in it's august presence, and gets a wee bit irritated about 
it.  Irritated enough to add more than the 1 point of hate a successful 
taunt gives a warrior over the next highest on the list.

That would seem to be the only explanation for the scenario.  (I tried 
this out with an enchanter last night and it seemed to go for her 
sometimes when she sat but never when she stood.)
