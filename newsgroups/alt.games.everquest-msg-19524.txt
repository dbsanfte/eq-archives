True that.  But cmon Alex, you don't really go to SA for gripping, in-depth
game reviews now do you?  The guy's a tool who it seems would do just as
well working for some porn industry insider mag covering all the 'juicy'
tidbits of the 'genre'.

Did he even give his specs?  Bout the time he neglected to say what exactly
the fuck he was running, I gave it the usual attention I do to a SA game
review...not alot.  Your experience is mine too.  I can usually play as long
as the servers hold out.

Yeah.  I'm with you but I think you take it too seriously.  The wittiness of
his comic-like game review was apparently lost on both of us.

Yup.  Personally, I'm taking anything anyone says about it with a grain of
salt until it's actually stable and optimized, since I play it too and
continue see some great potential there (deja vu rears its ugly head).

I think alot of us went into it knowing exactly what was wrong so no
surprises and thats why you don't see alot of people who are fans sitting
about saying what a peace of shit it is.  Usually the talk is quite the
contrary.  Now, if the guy had said it was more like a EQ meets Bladerunner,
may have payed him a wee bit more attention.  Hmm, nah.
