Very bad idea with the red lines character models,I was just logging
in for the 1st time after a week or so after rebuilding my computer
and wasted hours to solve this "issue".
Another nail in the coffin for EQ,instead of fixing graphic bugs like
the west bug,they have nothing better to do than to toy around 
exactly with the most sensitve file in EQ,the EQGraphicsDX9.dll.
