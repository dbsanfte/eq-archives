My mom is dead too, Have a seance.
Flirt online, go meet people, flirt with someone on the bus.
I dont have kids either so if you have nieces and nephews or friends
with spawn borrow them and sugar them up.
Wash your towels or buy some big fluffy towels dry so smell good and
fluffy and roll in them, if you want crinkles and crackles, buy a bunch
rice paper and put on ground and roll in it.

NEXT!!
