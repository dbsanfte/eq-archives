My favorite Cabalis story...

Preface: I'm on the road to raising faction via bone chips, and am
quite familiar with the various NPCs and what factions they're on. 


Another enchanter asked for help killing the epic mob in Cabalis.  As
I had been through it once for my epic, I went out to help lead people
there, plan strategy, etc.  And I took my rogue since a 2nd enchanter
doesn't do much good most times.

Enchanter makes it into Cabalis and got killed.  

"But, I used Iksar illusion and the guards out front con'd
indifferent... !  Why did those crusaders ago?"

Ranger makes it almost to Cabalis and gets killed in Field of Bone.

"But... I con'd dubious to the guards out front!"


I very LOUDLY reminded them that enchanters get invisibility and
rangers get superior camoflauge, both very good spells when venturing
in areas where you haven't tested your faction out.
