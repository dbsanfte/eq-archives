|When were rangers last nerfed?

	Let's see, the last time would be when we went from having the best lull
to having one of the worst.

|They can buff +ATK better than any other class

	Shaman/BL's get the nod here.

|They are better trackers than any other class.

	Marginal utility.

|They are better outdoor pullers than any other class

	Not any more.

|They have the best invuln disc (better than monks, warriors, rogues etc
|anyway.. I dunno about versus DA)

	It lasts longer, but the reuse time on the pure fighter versions is...?

|They have the joint best (debatable) spell in the game : ensnare
|(ok very debatable now) They have the best slow of melees

	Snares are nice, but they're not even close to being the best spell in the
game.  Yes, we have a nice slow, if you don't mind using a Kunark-era weapon.

|No don't make them useless,  but dude.. archery is so out of whack now.  If
|it got nerfed, you couldn't really have much cause for complaint.

	There is nothing "out of whack" about it.  Hunters are solidly behind
comparatively-equipped Rogues and Monks in terms of DPS, which is where they
should be as a non-tanking fighter class.
