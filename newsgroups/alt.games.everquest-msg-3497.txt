Did his name change from red to green first, before you? I only ask
because I *believe* (and I'm sure I'll be corrected if wrong) that until
you hit your trade button turning your name green, you can keep putting
things in, taking them out, etc.  It is only after you hit Trade that you
will get the "You must complete or cancel the transaction" message if you
try to make more changes. So, if he put the money up, and then pulled it
before you could put your item in the window and hit trade without you
noticing, the trade would have gone through. Of course, if you paused and
double checked right as you were hitting the trade button, that wouldn't
explain it either.
