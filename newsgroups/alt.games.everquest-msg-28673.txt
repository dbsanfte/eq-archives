Ive been able to use my 'rain spells' as the killing blow.  Both my wizard
and my mage have been able to kill MOBs with a rain spell.  I dont use the
often though becuase they have the nasty effect of hurting everyone in the
radius of the spell.

With my wizard I perform the root and nuke tactic and have killed orcs,
wasps, and other low level things with the Rain of Ice.  With my Mage Rain
of Blades took out a MOB and my pet :(.
