I remember a year or so ago someone posted a picture on everlore that
showed a secret island, no mobs on it, I believe an NPC or two, with a
white sandy beach, and shrubbery and palmtrees.  When asked where it was I
recall that it was said to be in OOT, but through 2 underwater secret
passages.  Where you pass through the first, then are taken out to an
opening, then there is another.  Does anyone know of this place?  Heard of
it?  Anything?  Or is time for me to just start swimming around with a
froggie?
