for shamans,  the malo line is very comparable to the tash line.  I guess my
comments were to vague and general.  I don't see mezzing 10 mobs before most
parties would be wiped out anyhow, but 3 or 4 extras does seem reasonable.
Pacify is an excellent point to an advantage that Enchanters have over
shaman, but Clerics get that spell line also.  I think it's the healing with
slow, hast, and damage, that make me think the shaman is the most powerful.
I'm sorry if my original post sounded trollish, but I would like to see some
points to why other classes are equally powerful.  Maybe I hijacked the
thread in the wrong way.
