A 57 Cleric can easily get a ton of useful lowbie Enchanter items.
You really oughta do your own research though.  That said, I suggest
you at least get the pieces for the Fine Antique Ring quest, it will
serve the Enchanter well for many levels.  You might also consider
making a new character yourself to duo with the Enchanter, rather
than PLing.  That way you won't have her trying to learn to play her
character effectively while fizzling up a storm at 24 (Enchanter is
not the most trivial character to play in EQ).
