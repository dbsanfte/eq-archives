Look through your spell book and at the complete list of spells 1-65.
You will want to specialize in the branch that you will use the most.
Most Druids (if not all of them) specialize in Alteration.
Specialization means less fizzles and reduced mana cost when casting.

I choose Alt for my druid, and never regretted it.
