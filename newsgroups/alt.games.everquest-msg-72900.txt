On the one hand, I can see what you're saying. Particularly if the
"asking for donations" messages indicated or implied that the funds
would only go to pay for server costs. But on the other hand, if the
person running the site really does a lot of the in-game research
themselves, then I guess the ability to go to Luclin and *explore* for
the primary purpose of publishing the findings wouldn't be totally out
of line either. 

*shrug*. You'll rarely if ever get a chance to get back donated funds
once the check has been cashed, so I figure don't lose any sleep over
it.
