Ya left out Bard you scumsucker, the likes of which have ruined your own lands, 
you'll not ruin mine!  I think it's a pretty decent list, but I would have SKs 
above Paladins, just because in certain situations they are the BEST pullers in 
the end-game, faster feign recycle than monks, more HP.  I would actually move 
Enchanters down a bit, since you really only need one enchanter on most raids 
(chain-rune raids excepted of course).  I know the only class my guild is NOT 
looking to increase is our enchanter class, and the enchanters have been very 
ademant that we don't need any more. 

Cleric	Never have enough of these
Warrior Very useful, but only need a couple
Wizard  Damage Damage Damage
Rogue   Manafree Damage Damage Damage
Monk    Pulling and Damage
Shaman  Slows and debuffs, healing, buffs
SK      Pulling, controlling MOB during MA transistions
Bard    Resists, debuffs, buffs, manadrain, mana mana mana
Enchanter  Hastes, debuffs, brain buffs
Ranger  Damage from afar
Pally   Tanking and healing the healers
Necro   Decent damage on long fights
Mage    Damage but most useful for modrods (much higher on 200khp mobs)
Druid   Healing, some damage, buffs
Beastlord  Not enough to know yet, epic could be nice depending on resists

I've gone on many 55+ raids, and we're done without almost every class, except 
for clerics and warrior.  A good group who raids together daily can work around 
missing one or two useful classes, especially on known mobs, but for a pickup 
group, or new raiders, having enough of every class certainly helps.  
Certain types of fights will change this order drastically, like very long 
fights making mages a key componant.  Scouting the two top guilds on our server 
shows that they have 30-40 mod rods on the ground before every boss mob fight.  
Mages are a huge part of their strategy, guess we need to pull all those mages 
out of retirement.  
As a side note, my guild has killed Trakanon over and over to get VP keys.  It's 
not something we look forward to, but since he's contested (3 or 4 new guilds 
have decided they want to check it out too), we race to get him whenever he's up 
and we're not actively raiding elsewhere.  We often ended up raiding with small, 
unbalanced raid teams.  Raiding Trak without an enchanter is trivial, even doing 
Juggs without an enchanter isn't tough with good pullers.  Doing Trak without a 
necro on the other hand is a bitch.  Most folks just NEED that DMF to get PR 
high enough to resist the AEs.
