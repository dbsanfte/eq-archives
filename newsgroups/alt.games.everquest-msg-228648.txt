Well therein lies the problem.  Necromancer pets don't come cheap and they
don't have much hp.  Reclaim energy gives pet hp/10 mana.  After quickly
looking over the lists of pet hp and casting costs it would seem a
necromancer would need through specialization and focus effects cut the
casting cost of his pet in half to break even on mana spent to mana
reclaimed.  Added is the fact that all the 59+ pets cost a peridot + bone
chip to cast, and there is no Necromancer aa ability like Elemental Pact,
which I really wish there was - I have a terrible habbit of forgetting to
buy new reagents, so much so that I often have to put post-it notes on the
side of my monitor to remind me.
