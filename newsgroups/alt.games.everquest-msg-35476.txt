First off, he wasn't "offering" kisses, he was buying them. Second, I'm going to
give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you missed this part from
the original posting:

Now, I could write paragraphs about this but if you honestly cannot
see what's wrong with some guy doing this to some girl he's just met,
with no prompting from her and with no time for her to respond then
there's no way for me to enlighten you. This person isn't concerned with
"being romantic", he's only concerned with building a romantic fantasy
in order to make himself feel better.

Now THAT'S funny! :-) Tell, me, Mr Worm-Hater: What, exactly, is the
payoff from ingratiating myself with "Lelilali"? She doesn't give the name
of any of her characters, so on the extremely low chance that she plays
on my server, I'm not going to recognize her. The odds that she lives in
my town and is going to think highly enough of me for "slagging my gender"
to want to meet me in real-life are just about the same as the odds for
that lesbian menege-e-tois that P. Tang seems to think I fantasize about.
In any case, "Lelilali" has made her preferences quite clear so I'd say
that trying to ingratiate myself with her would be a waste of time,
in any case.

I dunno, maybe I'm missing the boat on this one. Are any of the female
readers of this list finding themselves suddenly irresistably attracted to
me due to my "slagging my gender"? If so, send me an email!

> An enormous blazing overeaction if ever i heard one.

Y'know, you say that because YOU are normal and have a reasonably
secure ego. The biggest mistake you can make online is to assume that
everyone you interact with is like you. I've seen it happen online many times.
There's a class of men who are totally sucked in by the power trip of "romancing"
a woman online where it's safe and she really can't do anything to stop you.
You don't have to  acknowledge anything short of a "get lost jerk". It's further
complicated by the fact that women tend to flirt more online than they do in
real life and  it feeds into the fantasy lives of these guys. I've seen it happen
over and over to women I know in real-life. Best thing is to put a stop to it
before
it even starts.

It isn't just Lelilali. There was a post along similar lines here within the
last month, and there's a posting in the Newbie Zone right now by a woman
who essentially was trying to figure out why some guy she barely knew online
got huffy and stormed off when she wanted to group with another guy.

If recognizing a problem and advising women players to recognize the symptoms
and stop it before it starts is slagging my gender then I guess you can consider
yourself slagged. *shrug*
