He's a level 50 monk, he can handle the 1stone that 40pp would way.
Or he could do like almost every other monk in the game and have some
kind of coin-purse.
As to the suggestion that he couldn't run to the bank, he's a fucking
monk, he's pretty much forced to be bound in a city (yes, I know of
several melee bind points that aren't in cities, but I've never seen
another person bound in any of them), and if he can't hit the damn
bank when he's there, he's an ass.
I have taken to carrying 500pp, 6 coffins, and several stacks of
periodots with me all the time now.  It's amazing how having those few
things on me will make any type of group wipeout pretty much not a
problem anymore.
