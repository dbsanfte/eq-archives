At 36 try SolB, Echo Caverns, Great Divide (you'll want the faction from one
side or the other as you get higher anyway), EW, DL.

When in groups, look for a group that is doing yellows and low reds - if a
group is doing blues, your xp is likely to stink, especially if they are low
blues. Make sure that you are doing more than just playing mana song -
participate in the battle in some way and make sure you do some damage to
the mob. Remember when grouped that the group comes first, but either melee
or get a chant in from time to time. Figure in a group that mana is going to
be in demand (but also remember that you are the final word on what song is
right for the moment), but that haste is also going to be big (too many
groups don't realize that you have this), and your chants, chains, charms
can be devastatingly powerful. You will, however, get more xp if you get at
least some damage on the mob (clerics have the same basic issue, where they
seem to get more xp if they cast during battle as opposed to sitting it out
because no one needs a heal right now - but you don't want to run out of
mana for no reason!).
