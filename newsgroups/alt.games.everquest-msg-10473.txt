Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem, if you notice the flashing icon and
start running.  Heck, Bonds of Force is 2.5 second casting time, and
I've noticed no problems getting far enough ahead after a BoF resist to
try again, so 1.5 seconds would be easy.  I don't think I've tried any
slower spells against a mob running at me (well, at least with the
expectation of getting the spell off before the mob arrives, as opposed
to planning on channeling through the hits), but if you can get enough
ahead for 3 seconds, you might even be able to DD kite with
jboots/tboots, using the Draught spells.  Hmmm...time to get off my ass
and stop playing my alts and get my Wizard to 51 to try that (50 now).
