Nah, if your a druid, then Sow and lev yourself. Run through the
tunnel carefully. When you come out the other end climb up the
zonewall as high as you can and run "over" the zone. Most times I can
run from one end to the other without hitting the ground. High enough
to run over the castle. Keep an eye on your lev though, the fall will
kill you.
