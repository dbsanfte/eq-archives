This is not as important as it used to be, if you try to attack a Red target
it gives you a warning first, telling you it's gonna hand your ass to you if
you hit it again :�)
Yep, did this myself, never re-mapped the key, just learnt not to do it.
Having a 30 min rot time on your corpse made lessons hard ones but quickly
learnt...Wonder how new players today would cope with the old style of
things :�)
