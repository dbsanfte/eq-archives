That was my initial assumption also. However, when you consider that
you can mow through more mobs in the same amount of time with a full
group *and* get xp bonuses on them, it is better to have a full group.

Otoh, it *is* a bad idea to bring more into the group if you are
already experiencing unnecessary downtime due to infrequent spawns.
