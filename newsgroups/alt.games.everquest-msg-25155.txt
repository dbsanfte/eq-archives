I read your web page of requirements. Yep. Kind of sad, but pretty much
in line with the uberguilds on Xev. Not as *specifically* draconic, but
still right up there. I have to tell you, I put in <easily> twenty hours
a week, most weeks. Probably considerably more. But if I find myself in
a guild where I'm being told that I *have to* put in twenty hours a week
unless I can come up with documentation for a death in the family, etc.
then I'm in the wrong guild. If I have a week where my dear Uncle Jerome
wasn't thoughtful enough to die, but I decide to go work on my back deck
for several nights and I miss two raids, I don't expect to have to "Do
the right thing and leave or the officers will help you in your
decision."
  Man.... just sad. Not your guild specifically, but all these ones that
have determined that having a Real Life (tm) is some sort of evil thing
that you need to be punished for........ I just don't know. I think if
you recruited people who have traditionally been very active players and
fast levelers, they will likely continue to be that way. And if they hit
a slump where they just don't feel like raiding, or even playing, then
what's the harm? Are they cutting into your loot? Jeopardizing your
raid? (If so, then the raid party is too small, IMO) Naw. If there is no
planes, slash ubermob capable guild that can't live with people just
being people with real life concerns as well as EQ, then I guess I'll
either have to help build one myself, or never get there.
  On the plus side, at least I didn't see a rule on your page like on
one Xev guild I could name that says that all loot from raids is
considered guild property, even if you won the roll and are carrying it
and if you ever have the bad taste to quit the guild, you have to give
it all back. That would *definitely* be the last straw in my book.
