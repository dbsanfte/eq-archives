On Wed, 03 Apr 2002 19:16:25 GMT, "Xavier" <no@no.com> (if that IS his

None of which is what the two kids were said to be doing.

And here you're just flat out wrong. That's exactly what the channel
is meant to be for, and if that bothers you you're expected to turn it
off.

The people who want to shut up anyone who doesn't meet their own
personal requirements are the ones who need a wakeup call. It's funny
that they are being called prepubescent when its the supposed adults
who are being so immature about it.
