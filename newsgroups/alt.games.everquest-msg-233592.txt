In the big scheme of things you are absolutely right about this.  
The necro and the beastlord standing around doing nothing with their pets at
their feet during battle *won't* get the blame if you lose.  
On the other hand, I will remember them and choose not to group with them

I for one was grateful for those clerics when I needed a rez, and always
donated generously.  OTOH, my cleric never charges for rezzes.
