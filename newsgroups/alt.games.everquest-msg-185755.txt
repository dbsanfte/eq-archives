Ok, finally found one.  Spawned on the ground right next to the trunk of a platform tree
near the POD lift at kelethin.  ONLY on this spot did I find another, some 15 to 20
minutes later.

Still have not found any sign of the Thicket Twig in Misty Thicket.  Aside from MT, the
only other thicket zone is Shadeweaver's Thicket on Luclin, correct?
