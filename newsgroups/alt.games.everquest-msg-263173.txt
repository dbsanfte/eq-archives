If it's only a change in summoned pets, it's the best of both worlds. 
Summoned pets stick around (and don't get agro anymore from anything) 
and charmed pets will still break. They do specifically mention summoned 
pets. We shall see.

Concidering everyone but an enchanter can ditch their pets at will (/pet 
go away or some such.. I don't know I'm an enchanter :)) I don't see how 
it could be a nerf if it is just summoned pets. Unless some loony 
enchanter has figured out some great leet method of soloing by killing 
their own pets.
