    I hate people who go looking for buffs in the middle of a camp. "Guys, I 
*need* to go get KEI. It'll take me 20 minutes, during which you'll do 
nothing. But don't worry, I'm sure we'll make up that time during the 45 
minutes I spend with you after that before logging!"

    How did I ever level up as a cleric with no KEI, with tanks that had my 
buffs and not someone else's, and with no flowing thought? It boggles the 
mind!

    James
