	I didn't say twinks were insecure.

	I said anyone who says "you don't like twinking because you're
jealous" is insecure.  

	You may be confusing the two because you may think that all
twinks hold the opinion that anti-twinks are simply jealous.  This is
not so.  I twink, and I do not hold the opinion that anti-twinks are
simply jealous.  When I was anti-twink, my opinions had nothing to do
with jealousy.

	Therefore, not all twinks hold the opinion that anti-twinks
are just jealous.

	Anyone who says "anti-twinks are just jealous" is, in essence,
saying "Anti-twinks dislike twinking because they want to be as l33t
as I am!"  This is what we call "dick-waving."  And yes, I think it
screams "I'm an insecure fuck" pretty loudly.

	Not really.

	Correct.  Which is why I twink them with gear that will get
them through levels 1-10 fairly quickly and with a minimum of fuss,
but which will start to become obsolete by the teen levels.  I fail to
see how this is inconsistent with my statements.

>"good" and "bad" *levels* of twinking? 

	No.  "Good" and "Bad" are value labels that you choose to
attach to my description.  I did not attach value labels.  There is
"heavy twinking" and there is "light twinking."  At no point did I say
that "heavy twinking" is "bad" while "light twinking" is good.

	Moreover, applying value labels implies that I care about
whether or not others twink.  As I've stated, I don't care.  "Heavy"
twinking vs. "light" twinking is a useful, non-judgemental way to
describe the difference between a 2nd level warrior in full cobalt and
dual Lammys vs a 2nd level warrior in full leather and dual langseax.
