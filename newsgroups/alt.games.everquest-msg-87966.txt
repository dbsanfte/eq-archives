 Tis' his opinion and a reponse should be expected. But a disection of =

 I actually figured that it was obvious any male would come to your aid =
and thus put you on that pedestal for which you thrive. Most men also =
have a hidden agenda when taking such a position. You are either too =
nieve to take notice, or you sink into this character for it is the only =

 It is a dump. Kinda like a group of trolls that infested what used to =
be a good source of information. Now, it seems one must pass an =
inspection of the self appointed Gods in here. I will say some in here =
offer good info, but many come in here seeking information. What you =
offer is criticizem of proper news group ettiquette, followed by a very =
un-educated stance of the Canadian inability to skate. You impress me =
not and your glass for sure :-)
"I am Lokari, show me attention PLEASE !!!!"   Old song my friend, seen =
it many times.

 Oh please accept my humble invitation. It could be fun and =
adventurious.=20

Newsflash- In the game, your just another PC period. Its not real as is =
this NG. You can say whatever you wish about who you are. In all =
actuallity, its who you want to be, not who you are. But after a while =
of being a listener as opposed to a loudmouth, people start to see =
through you indeed. Afterall, your Canadian, and a Woman. What the hell =
could you possibly know ?

LOL, Have a Nice Day lesser one. Consider this ranting done because my =
point was made. I had you at hello so too speak. So please either block =
me and shut up, or get in the game and be shut up. Choice is yours, but =
be warned. You pull this line of BS in the game, and I will promise you =
lvl 2 may be your last.  Just ask Stein :-)
