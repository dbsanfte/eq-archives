I hate mem blur...it works about as often as the built-in mezz chance of
blurring.  But yeah, stunning + mez or root is the best solution in the best
of cases.

Trouble is when multiple critters are hitting you.  AE mez works great at
lower levels in most zones but once you get to learn your craft and trust
your healers single target mez is the way to go.  I don't think I was a good
enough enchanter until about 25 or so.  Of course, it also helps to have
healers that understand to heal you fast, AND to give you symbol.  It also
helps to have tanks who understand that when there's an enchanter in the
group, DON'T TRY TO SAVE THE CASTERS!!  Cleric keeps enchanter alive,
enchanter keeps everyone else alive.

Anyway, when you have a critter that does 400+ points a round damage and you
only have 2000hp it tends to be those very critters that are magic resistant
to some extent, so you gotta have a healer you trust.  Outdoors my usual
deal is to root them asap then back off.  If the critter is the tank's
target I slow/tash it, if it's an add I tash/mez it.

Sucky thing about being an enchanter at high levels.  If you tash at the
start of the fight, you will be attacked.  If you do nothing (assuming no
shaman), the tanks take a big beating.  So usually my only choice is to slow
first THEN tash...obviously not the most desirable order.

I love playing an enchanter...the only pure INT caster with no AC that's
MEANT to be banged around. <g>  I LOVE jumping into a fight and
chain-stunning (make sure you have the pages for your level 20 stun!) when
the cleric's at 10% health and highest on the hate list, but now with time
to heal himself.

Enchanters are by far the most powerful class.  The best part is, most
people don't realize it.  We're also the ones that're allowed to be
bossiest. :)
