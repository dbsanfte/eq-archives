You getting a bit soft in your old age aren't you Bizbee? The first thing I
thought after reading him was:

"Please develop testicular cancer, and may it cause a huge swelling in your
throat where it is most obvious that your testicle reside. May it continue
growing, swelling and pressing in against your airways until eventually
bursting internally and dumping litres of fluid into your trachea, down into
your lungs. May your last breath be spent choking on your own puss, blood
and and testicular fluid. Bascially: die fucktard, horribly.

Oh - and I mean that in the nicest possible way."
