Because of the choice of zones I have made in leveling I have not fought a
whole lot of undead and have not yet really used many of the undead line of
spells. The other day I made my first visit to the Burning Wood and thought
it would be interesting to charm the mouldering gorillas. Indeed it was fun,
if a little nerve racking as its impossible to know when the charm will
break. I concluded the best strategy would be to break charm and re-charm -
However I could not find an easy way to break the charm. I assumed Hide
would work as it does on regular skelly pets - but this did not seem to
work. Also it became apparent that you need to keep the pet alive at least
until you can kill it yourself - if the mob kills it you dont get the XP.

If someone could post some tips on undead charming - spell combos etc. that
would be great as I would like to practise some more of this.
