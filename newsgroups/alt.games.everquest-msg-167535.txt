Indeed I know exactly how you feel. My bard hit 51 just the other day.
I tried the Plane of Nightmares, and its supposed to be insane
experience for high level players (and the number of people hunting
there proves that.) However the experience still seems to go
dreadfully slow to me. I get about a quarter of a blue (maybe that) a
kill, and that might sounds good, but its really not. These new mobs
hit for 375 and take down a level 60 tank in seconds to nothing. You
have to med up big time between pulls. Anyway experience in the 50's
totally blows and the game is just getting dull to me. The only fun I
have had since level 40 was going on a Naggy raid last night and it
was funny as hell since a bunch of idiots pushed the dragon into the
lava and two groups of people died LOL. But they beat it anyway. Well
in any case im very temped and will probably stop playing my bard and
play a more usefull class like Cleric or Enchanter so that I can enjoy
the lower levels where I actually gain a level every now and then. I
can't wait for a new game to come out.
