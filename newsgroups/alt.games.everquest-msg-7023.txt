I just installed one of these as a replacement for my V5 5500 after
Tribes 2 and lack of decent OpenGL support finally put a fork in it.
I was satisfied with it in EQ at 1024 x 768, 2x FSAA, maxium clip plane
but I HAD to keep particle effects off ( directX mode ran better than
Glide after the "prep for Velious patch" IMO)

So far my experience with the GeForce3 playing EQ for about 15 min:

Framerate is doesn't drop much anymore in the usually laggy places I
have seen. Everything is maxed out in EQ's video settings and I can
turn particles on for the first time. Running with the new GF3 AA
setting "Quincunx" (have they fired the guy that named that yet?)
jaggies are under control but there is still a lot of pixel shimer
in some texures that that the voodoo didn't have, but maybe adjusting
some driver settings can cure that.
