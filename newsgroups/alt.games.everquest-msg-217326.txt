Or better yet, they secretly nerfed my defensive capabilities. Or I'm
losing my mind.  Probably the latter, but I just wanted to check with
others to see if just maybe I"m not the only one feeling
sorta...different.

Rak and I have enjoyed duoing the Nobles/Highborns camp in Veksar
lately.  We took a break from it when LDoN came out, though, and only
started hunting there again last Saturday.  To my dismay, I saw my health
bar going lower than I've ever seen it before, and I heard a lot of teeth
grinding from Rakyn, followed by complaints of severely heavy mana usage
trying to keep me alive.

We've gone over everything...spells we use (no change there on buffs...in
fact, I now have an increased DS)...gear (I've upgraded my AC and HP, no
changes for Rak)...and general tactics (no change there).  But Rak says he
no longer has mana to nuke because he's busy trying to keep me alive.

We're wondering if we just entirely misremembered what Veksar nobles used
to be like for us, but by any chance have any chain clases here noticed a
shift in their defensive abilities since LDoN came out?  I've heard many
reports of resists and tradeskill successes being messed up...so it sounds
like the RNG has gone renegade...and stories of casting bugs...but no
hints of mitigation/avoidance changes.  It *seems* like it's a mitigation
thing to me...numbers are just consistently higher....but hell if don't I
suck at parsing myself. (Oh, my statistics teacher would cry to see me
now!)

So, um, any other rangers, rogues, or shaman notice a change in their
sponging abilities?
