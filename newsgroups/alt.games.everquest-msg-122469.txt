Our guild's lower level members did another Naggy raid last night. Naggy
was a bit tougher since the last patch, but went down. A guildie jumped
on the corpse to log all the loot and hold the corpse till the rolling
could start.

Coincidentally (*cough*) sombody trains a bunch of bats and such through
the staging area up to the mouth of the lair where Naggy dropped.
Guildie get's knocked off corpse, but lives. Go back to examine
corpse....

Empty, except for a sulfer.

Stolen: Two GoFM, Pally book, Diamond, Shammy hammer.  The REAL pisser
will be if it wasn't even a pally.

/petition finds only a Guide online who says a GM will pull the logs to
find out who ninja'd and get back to raid leader today.

But for fifty bucks, this asshole just made a hell of a haul.

This was on Xev, by the way. I'll let you know what we find out.
