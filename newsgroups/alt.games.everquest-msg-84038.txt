Possibly spawns Ry'Gorr avengers.  See invis, backstab, about the same level
as a Ry'Gorr elite

Yeah, but if druids didn't have sow, how would you keep up with all the "sow
plz" people?  Your ignore list can only fit so many ignorant n00bs.  And
don't forget to complain about rangers getting sow (and BLs).

And if by, "nuke harder than a mage" you really mean "get a shitload of
resists on hard to cast nukes" then yes, druids at 60 do indeed nuke harder
than a mage.  We have one freakin lure resist spell, and its a damn debuff.

Hey, did I mention that RoDK drops a whole hell of a lot more often than
RoTG?
