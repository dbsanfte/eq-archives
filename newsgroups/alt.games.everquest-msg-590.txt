Well, bud, being so brand spanking new to the game in comparison to most, I
will bow to the experienced voices and say that since I've yet to get anywhere
near those levels, I can't argue.  Maybe grouping is not only required, but a
lot more fun in high level scenarios.  I'd like to find out, but thus far I
have never gotten any exposure to the "good side" of grouping. To this point,
I get group experience in one of two ways. Sometimes, I manage to get time on
at the same time as a couple of IRL friends and we go out together and group,
as we did this weekend, when three of us hooked up to hunt in Qeynos Hills.
Good idea, right? Except that with such a limited choice of characters, we
wound up with a Monk (6) and two Rangers (7).  Not exactly the "well oiled
machine" that Verant refers to, eh?  The other way is when I've managed to get
invited to join a group with people I don't know. Thus far that's been an
unmitigated disaster. Probably just not good groups and I'm not experience
enough to know a bad one when I see one.
  But as to the soloing stuff, I have to answer one thing you said in this
post:
**************
"There is no risk to 90% of the soloing I see.  Sitting and camping a
single-spawn that barely cons blue to you is about as exciting as watching
paint dry.  If you're going to solo and bitch about experience, at least fight
stuff that cons even to you, or pull 5 or 6 blue mobs at a time, but since I
NEVER see anyone doing that."
**************
I don't know who you watch solo, but that's not my style, and I've really come
to enjoy soloing at these lowbie levels a lot (5-10).  I spend a lot of that
time on corpse runs, I can tell you. I ignore blues unless there is absolutely
nothing else around. I don't "camp" anything. I keep moving and looking for
targets, and take on only blacks and yellows, then going toe-to-toe with them
until it runs or I go down. (By the time I realize I should have run away, I'm
so far down on HP/Mana/and-or Stamina that I'd never escape anyway, so I keep
fighting.)  I may die more than some, but when I win the xp is a lot better,
and I've made several levels in one session that way.
  I guess it just won't work at high levels, and there are some quests/areas
where a solo will never be able to go, so I'll have to learn good group
skills.  But it sure would be nice if there were more solo friendly elements
to the game. It can (in my limited experience) be really challenging and a lot
more fun than watching paint dry.
