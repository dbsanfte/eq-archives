Not many more AA needed for my skill and would like some comments from
others who already have the skill.

I was under the impression that Dire Charm worked on mobs up to LVL45.

When we killed Klandicar the other day a Cragwyrm and a Gravid Drake
aggroed. I conventionally charmed the Cragwyrm and sent it off to do battle
against Kland but my guildmate Chanter Dire Charmed the Gravid Drake. From
all my research I learn the minimum level for A Gravid Drake is LVL48.

So from experience of others, what is the LVL limit of mobs that can be Dire
Charmed?
