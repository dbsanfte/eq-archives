Wired Magazine was quoted as saying:
> Ultima Online, the first commercially successful role-playing game,

Nit-pick: shoudn't that be "commercially successful online role-playing
game"?  I'm pretty sure there were many successful commercial role-playing
games before UO.

> This year, the game's 225,000 players will be entertained with holiday

Hmmm....UO has 225k?  That's around what DAoC had last time they released
numbers, so I'd guess DAoC is a little bigger now.  So, the top 3 would
probably be EQ, DAoC, UO?  Anyone seen numbers for the others, such as AO,
AC, AC2, E&B, Neocron?  I'm just curious how the various games rank in terms
of number of players.  (And Lineage is pretty big in Korea...it might be
ahead of DAoC and UO in numbers...maybe even ahead of EQ).

I wonder if it really is millions (plural) yet.  Let's give EQ 500k, UO and
DAoC 250k each.  That's one million.  I've heard that AC has around 70k.  I
doubt AC + AC2 + AO + the various less common ones add up to a million.
Of course, like I said, Lineage is pretty big, so maybe there 2 million or
more MMORPG players worldwide.
