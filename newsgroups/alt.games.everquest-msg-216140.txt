The errors I encountered were indeed that bad.  Like I said elsewhere, 
maybe it was just bad luck that all the information I happened to be 
interested in when I went there seemed to invariably be incorrect.  I 
gave up on it a very long time ago as a result.  More than once it had me 
running of to some very out of the way place to purchase a spell that was 
not available where it said it should be.
