I never had any problems with that spell.  It was healing about 10% of his 
HPs when I was fighting Gargs.  I think this was my process:

( I would have Allure on me )
Pull with 1 Dot ( heaviest one, not Engulf, because 2 dots would aggro them 
on me)
Send pet
Alternate between Lifetaps and mend bones
Engulf near end, if needed
Leach at end

After the battle, if it was efficient to heal him, I would, and it would 
almost always heal 10%.

Do you have a "/pet report health" ( I think that is it ) hot key?  You can 
see if it is working with that.
