Here's what I think:

Enchanter is about the only one that makes sense for Jewelry, because of the
need for enchanted metals.

A cleric would be a good smith because of the need for his or her own armor
and also because clerics can imbue stones which are used in cultural smithing,
though, ideally, you'd want a smith that can forage because some of the dyes
and tempers for higher level smithing require foraging.  However, since dyes
and tempers require brewing, you could leave that up to your brewer.

A druid or ranger would be best for tailoring since they are good in outdoor
zones where they can hunt animals.  (Not that they aren't good indoors too,
no flames please)

Gnomes are the only ones that can tinker.  I don't know what class would be
best for a tinkerer... maybe Mage.

Shaman are the only ones that can do Alchemy.  They'd also make a good
brewer..

Mages, Wizards, and Necros could learn most of the skills quickly, but
would need more stuff from other players at higher levels, which means it would
take more time and money.

Monks, Warriors, Rogues, and Bards are probably bad choices for tradeskills
as their WIS and INTs are low, which means without a lot of WIS or INT gear,
they will learn painfully and expensively slowly.  The higher of WIS or INT is
what determines how fast they learn
