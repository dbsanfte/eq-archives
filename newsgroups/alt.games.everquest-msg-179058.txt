>Level 20 to 40 is pretty boring for all classes. However, keep in mind

I'll clarify for him.  Level 20-40 is boring for all classes if you want it 
to be boring.  To keep it from being boring, find 5 other people who want 
to have fun and group with them constantly and see new places together.  Go 
check out some dungeons.  My original warrior did levels 23-45 with the 
same group of people and we had a blast.  Our crowd control was a bard - I 
guarantee you he was never bored that whole time.
