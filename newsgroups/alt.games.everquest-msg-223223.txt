here's an interesting link -

http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/faq/faq1.shtml

You'll note that no one uses the phrases blue/green and red/green color
blindness on most sites.

From my reading red/green color-blindness results from Deuteranopia,
where the green cones (who's primary purpose is distinguishing between
red and green) are deficient.

I still haven't determined what technical term best describes whet
people call blue/green colorblindness.
