As others have posted, the bane of the enchanter pet owners is to turn
around and the pet is just gone.  You have no idea where, but from
previous experience you know that at some point the pathing demons got
into  him and he scooted off faster than an elder snow griffin for parts
unknown.  Currently the enchanter has two options, invis and hope that
makes the pet poof, or retrace your steps keeping an eye out for the
wayward pet to come barreling back towards you.  In either case its a
good idea to look for taunting messages so you know its time to get the
heck out of the zone.
