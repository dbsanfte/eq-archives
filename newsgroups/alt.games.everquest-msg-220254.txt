   I'm innocent!  I never killed any of those kittens in real life.  And they
know for certain that one was killed by a dog.  This is sort of a  rural area,
and not all the local wildlife is kitten friendly.

   But this incident highlights to me my original point.  These people don't get
their cat fixed, and when she has kittens, they don't keep them safe.  And I
stand by my original adjective.  

Deplorable.
