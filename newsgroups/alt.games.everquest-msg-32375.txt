    Not really, what you seem to have missed was actually said in another

    Yes, the two largest nations which are described (internally and
externally) as communist were the former USSR and (currently) China.

    Both claim to be communist nations.  Both are described as communist
nations.
    I never said it was a successful implimentation of communism... in fact
I think we proved that the Soviet Union was specifically a failure
(ultimately).
    See, part of the problem here is preception of the arguement.  The
discussion was that Verant is not "communist" in the enforcement of their
rules, and what the original poster thought was a violation of his (U.S.)
first amendment rights.
    I suggested that the posters description of this being communist stems
from him not knowing what the word means.  I further gave an historical
lineage of how he (might) has come to think that communist means
"controling, oppressive, and denying of civil rights."
    I am not well enough versed in the particulars of BOTH nations to
discuss at length their particular flavors of communist ideals, nor their
implimentations or failures to impliment them.  So I would (and do) not have
argued that point.

    What I did say was (and is) that both nations have and do express(ed)
that they are communist, and that they hold communist ideals, and as a
result of other factors within and without both nations this has resulted in
the perception (in the uneducated) that communism is synonymous with denial
of civil rights.

    Heh... Income Tax in the United States was specifically unconstitutional
until 1913 and the 16th ammendment.

LOL.
