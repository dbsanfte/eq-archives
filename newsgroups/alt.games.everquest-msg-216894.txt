There's a spot in KC basement where things agro through walls. Likewise the 
goblin tunnels in LOIO. Likewise much of Hate. Likewise....

You're right, I am not looking at the hundreds of complex equations that 
happen every minute in a battle, all of which hinge on a known-faulty 
random number generator.

I retried one this weekend, in the interest of giving them a fair shot. 
Yep, we lost it, and we were grinding through mobs at a rate that would 
have had a Slaughter finished inside an hour.

How fucking arrogant of you to assume you know someons character's

I am always careful with my mana. I also am always careful with my aggro.

I do it all the time, provided I think the tank has enough aggro. 
Frequently I can pull a CHeal and sit immediately after with no fear.

I stay far enough away that I can stand again if the mob comes for me. I 
sit, and immediately stand if the mob shows interest. Then the mob reverts 
back to his prior target, the MA.

Last night, our Monk (52) was a  better tank than our pally (55). How sad 
is that, especially after the AC nerf?

No, I have proven why I want a buffer of mana to deal with my sudden need 
for CHealing 1.3 times as often.

You are so clue resistant it is not funny. Here, I will dumb it down for 
you:

Me have 20m. 20m good for heal one warrior through pull. Warrior go ld go 
bye bye. Now me try to heal ranger with mana that barely do job on warrior. 
SOW PLZ for cr?

Only if one is deliberately being obtuse.

It is common for a tank to come to a group with a virtue, aego, or 
whatever. If I have been planning my healing strategy around that 
buff(which is reasonable- it lasts many hours) or some other buff(KEI, 
regrowth, whatever) and one of those factors changes, then my healing is 
instantly costing more per minute. That is mana I might not have because 
the monk decided to pull when I fucking told him not to.

Temperance: 48 AC 800 HP 550 mana
Shield of Words + Resolution: 31 AC 300 mana + 16AC 250 HP 110 mana 
Shield of Words + Symbol of Naltron: 31 AC 300 mana + 525 HP 315 mana

So Temp gets me 48 and 800 for 550, Shield of Words and Symbol gets me 31 
AC and 525 HP for 615, and SoW plus Reso gets me 47 and 250 for 410.

SoW and Symbol is right out- there's no advantage- it does not last as long 
or provide as much benefit, and it still consumes a dot. Now the 
competition is SoW and Resolution, which is a difference of 550 HP and 
140mana, and lasts 2/3 the time Temperance does. All told, except in the 
tightest of tight pinches, I would choose the Temp.

Yep, you are slumming in LDON. Slumming and "balls to the wall" is not 
quite the same thing, now is it?

We all remember how it works, we just don't agree that the cleric should be 
at 20m for it.

Link your rangers Magelo?

OK, make it normal then.

I said not uber twinked. IE things that are reasonable at the level they 
are at- no FT3 items, or planar stun weapons, or ornate, or...

You get the point.
