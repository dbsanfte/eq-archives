I have an ATI All in Wonder 128. It seems to me most problems with video
cards I see here are people with the ATI cards.

I have the problem where the screen flickers when I look at inventory. Then
when I get off the inventory screen there is black clor where the menus on
the screen were.  I have only had EQ a week and I haven't played much at all
beause of this issue.

I have been thinking of upgrading to a new video card anyway. Are there any
other cards I need to be wary of?
