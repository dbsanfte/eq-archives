Hm,no way I am a "raider",although I am only missing
Agnarr for elementals if I can trust the Seer,got my flags
more by coincidence,some lucky pickupraids and during
my short memberships in 3 raiding guilds.
Left them,because I was bored to tears by raiding and
rewards arent that great,maybe raids were worth it
for the charm upgrade and some aas.
So my gear is mostly Bazaar bought,except weapons
and some armour parts,I have spent 12k Ldon points.

Ok,to my point.
I *like* the GoD Trials,they give me a sense of danger,
I never had since doing the journey from FP to Qeynos
for the first time or visiting ToV,when it was new.
And I like it that the mobs respawn in GoD,so you really
must be careful not to die or you will not see the "end mob",
which is a good thing.
I dont need to be succesful on *every* trial to have fun,
and the xp you get in GoD makes a trial worthwile
any time.

Surely I am in the minority concerning God,but I think
what made a lot of people quit is the combination 
of burn out and the terrible implementation of DX9,while
at the same time leaving (very) old bugs alone,and probably
the poll for transfering game items for rl money wasnt too
helpful in keeping the customers. :)

Maybe I would have quit,if GoD would have been the 
same style  like PoP,endless flagging with no rewards,
while at  the same time separating the player base.

If you have a closer look ,GoD is not that bad,you can 
achieve a lot with single groups unlike PoP.
