What sort of place would be best for powerlevelling a 23rd level enchanter?
I have a 53 druid and it seems like a luclin dungeon would be best? I hate
PC though, it attracts the worst sort of bullies who refuse to share the
zone with anyone. Nothing more annoying than someone hogging the bandits
because they like the loot and can't be bothered harassing hill giants as
they are too green.

I mainly use him for enchanting metals so I'm not too fussed about loot etc.
 Would kurn's be good? 2 boxing with an enchanter/druid can be horrendous
because of the spell juggling and also because of the trouble finding decent
mobs that dont resist all his casts :P
