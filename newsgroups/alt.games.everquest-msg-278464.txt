We used this,worked fine,my 1st CH chain ever.

I think for one its the equipment nowadays,and the other key is the
raid leader.
I suppose people setting up a pickup raid want their alts have
flagged.
My Raid leader seemed very experienced,we did 6 Raids in 24h and
didnt wipe once,raid targets were Grummus,Hedge,Terris Thule,
Maniac Behemoth,Tallon and Vallon Zek.
At most we were 35 people in Raid.

I still find raids boring,1h setting up,1h killing trash mobs,2
minutes boss killing.I prefere single group content like (L)don
or the new missions,this gives me more the feeling that my
contribution really counts and I have to give my best to succeed.
Though I have to say the charm upgrade is pretty nice from the
few PoP raids.  =)
