Remember, it's the higher of INT and WIS that gets used to determine
your chance of skill-ups (in most tradeskills, at least).  So your
BST's low INT shouldn't matter as long as he has decent WIS.

Now, my poor Monk with base WIS 80 INT 75 is having a heck of a time
raising his tradeskills.  With various WIS items and a WIS potion
"borrowed" from my Druid alt (there's a fine, quick quest in Rivervale
for getting those) I can get all the way to WIS 134.

I've never seen even a guess at a formula for the chance of a skill-up,
but it seems clear that they're rarer as your skill increases.  My Monk
went from Brewing 46 to 68 in just under 100 combines (about 4.5 combines
per skill-up), but later, going from 140-160 or so I found it was taking
about 15 combines per skill-up.

Fortunately, Brewing is pretty cheap to practice, since it looks like
I'll be at it a while!  (I understand the cheap practice is balanced by
the cost of the GM trophy, which requires a tinkered ingredient that's
moderately expensive.)
