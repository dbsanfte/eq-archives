I have to go to the opposite extreme. At least in the 50+ game, I
would say that each class has a very specific role and that it's
really when people step out of their roles that things become
inefficient and death becomes much more likely.

A cleric should buff and heal. If things go badly, they should rez.
Any time they step out of that role, it's a sign that something has
gone wrong or is about to.
