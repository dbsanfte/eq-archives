On the contrary, the changes to Vox and Naggy were some of the best
things Verant ever did, and I only wish they had had the guts to make it
in the other places where it is needed, like the planes.

Without those changes, noone would be able to go on a dragon raid until
they were level 55 or so. Two groups of level 55s, or one of 60s, could
take down Vox/Naggy no problem. And as they could organise much faster
than the larger numbers of level 50s needed at the moment, then they
would always take that spawn before lower levels had a chance.

Which would mean that the game would be mindless levelling until 55,
instead of until 47 as at present. 

It could have been done better though - there should be a way of
temporarily and voluntarily dropping your level down to the level where
a mob/dungeon is a fair fight. Sort of like what people do by dieing
multiple times before fighting vox, then getting res'd again after the
fight.
