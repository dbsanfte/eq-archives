>Stonebrunt-  very very rarely is there more than 2 groups going at
>once, and this zone is HUGE. 

It's not all that easy to GET to Stonebrunt if  you can't port into tox.  Then
you have to run through the warrens.  You need a good map.  And for lower
levels: sow and camoflauge before you go in, run fast and hope that it holds
till you  get to Stonebrunt zone...
My level 34 ranger and level 32 wizard friend like the area - great with my
tracking - but getting there can be a challenge.
