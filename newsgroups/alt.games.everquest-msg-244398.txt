And yet I see enchanter charm used in XP groups roughly once a month.
I've seen it used as a method of sustained DPS once since PoP came
out.

I take that back. If you count Dire Charm, I've seen it a bit more
often, but that's hardly what you're talking about.

Once we have cleric, tank, slower and we're looking for DPS classes,
we are *not* looking for an enchanter. Other people's priorities will
differ, but I'm looking for, in order, Beastlord, Wizard, Necro,
Ranger, Rogue, other. And, of the three DPS types, one of them has to
be able to snare.
