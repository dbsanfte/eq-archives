Sure there's a downside -- you have to spend 60 levels and a
gazillion AA points as a Paladin being sub-part to a Warrior
in every aspect of melee.

I've got a 60.99 Paladin myself (with 6.78 AA points and counting),
and one of the bigger gripes in the Paladin community is that
we're not allowed to do *anything* better than a Warrior, melee-wise,
even for a moment in limited specialized circumstances.

Rangers/Rogues are allowed to put out more damage than a Warrior
because they can't *take* damage as well.  You'd think that at
least Paladins/SK's could be able to take damage better than
a Warrior because we can't put out as much.  Or something.  But
no, that's not in The Vision.  (Yes, we're compensated by having
spells, but the issue here is melee.)

That's also why the five Paladin fighting disciplines all
suck big donkey dicks.  There's nothing there that's even
remotely as useful as the Ranger Trueshot Discipline, the Monk
Stonestance discipline, etc. etc.  I have, in fact, activated
my Paladin's disciplines a grand total of eight times in his
entire career, and half of those were just for giggles.  None
are worth using, except in a "well, couldn't hurt..." sense.

So when Slay Undead came along, it was nice to have something
that was ours, unique, and actually superior to Warriors, even
if undead mobs aren't exactly in large supply.

And RP-wise, a Paladin *ought* to be able to kick undead butt
better than a Warrior.

(Note:  I'm aware they rescinded the nerf -- I'm just
discussing the flaws in their reasoning for wanting to
originally do the nerf.)

...yeah, so?

I'd say that the reason Paladins finally got a way to "increase
their situational damage by such a large amount" was because
they were too underpowered, on average, without it.

Slay Undead has given a lot of Paladins a reason to keep
playing (and many retirees have come back to the game for it).

And have been for two+ years.

*gasp*!  The horror, the horror...

...but not if it gives them any situational advantage over
ordinary warrior output, apparently...

My feeling is that the Slay Undead AA expenditures bring the
classes *into* relative balance.
