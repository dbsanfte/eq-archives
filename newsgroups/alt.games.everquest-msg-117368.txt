Actually, I think that if I had to pick a 6 person group made up
of all the same class, Palys would probably be it.

Heals, melee, ghetto mez, taunts, LoH...all possible with
6 paladins.

6 Rangers wouldn't be too bad, either...but it's more outside
based.  I'd love to see 6 rangers bowkiting the same mob...
