> The best way to deny port beggars is not to reply "sorry busy" or "no, I

  I think this is a bit rude.  Unless the person is being very rude or
demanding, I think everyone who asks deserves some sort of response.  It's
lame to just leave them hanging, letting them think that you're AFK, or that
you missed the tell, or are thinking about it, or whatever.  "No" should be
enough for anybody, but I think a person is entitled to at least that in
response.

  And what does it matter what THEY respond?  I personally kind of like
hearing a person's response to being denied a teleport, it gives you an idea
of their character.  If they get rude about it, and act as if it's your duty
to do them a favor, I've gained valuable information: that this is a person
I want to avoid at all costs.  Nothing that they can say can hurt me and as
long as you're not gullible enough to fall for "I'll pay well", you're not
really put out by any of their attempts to change your mind.

  Also, as Jason noted, you can use this as an oppurtunity to try to
"reform" them, though that may not be how you want to spend your time, you
may end up saving them, yourself or other teleporters some grief in the
future by explaining things from a different perspective.
