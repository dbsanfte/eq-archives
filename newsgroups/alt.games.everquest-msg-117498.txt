I'm supposed to give the giant traitor Wenglawks a note from the dragons of
skyshrine.  I know he used to be located in a noble room near the exit path
to wakening lands, but now he has been moved to another room with some
commoners.  The 'commoners' are red to my 48 bard and Wenglawks is blue.  He
used to wander away after a bit to give you a chance to speak to him in
private, but does he still do that?  Does anyone have a good strategy for
getting him away from the other giants to be able to exchange notes?  If no
better ideas are found then I plan to get a sow on, sing invis, open the
door, cast a long range song on him and train the lot to EW zone.  Then when
I zone back in I *might* be able to catch him alone while he  walks back to
position.
