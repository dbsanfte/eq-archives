...because Reagan wasn't elected until '80?  Because no president has a shot
at strongly affecting the economy in just 2 years?  He made a decision that
made life kinda rough until about '84.  Was it necessary?  Dunno.  Possibly.
It was a tough time to live, though.

And the inflation started a lot closer to '75, not '70.
