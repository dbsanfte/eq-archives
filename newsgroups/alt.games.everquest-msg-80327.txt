Sarnak broodlings spawn just a little further out than the hatchlings which spawn right next to Cabilis. Between the Goblin ruins
where the outriders are and the Skeleton ruins. They will not be past the hill with the Iksar statue and the row of pillars. That
zone is very large even in that small area of it. A druid or ranger to track them would speed the process up greatly.
