Hmm... It may not _all_ have been in HTML, but still.

HTML is not binary, of course.  

And in my view, MIME _is_ bad in newsgroups.  Multipurpose Internet _Mail_ 
Extensions.  It ain't News extensions for a reason.  But then, I don't 
like it in email either.  My mail was fine without being extended, thank 
you very much.

But then, I probably lead the curve on pickiness about such things. :)
