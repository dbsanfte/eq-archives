I fell down the same hole a few days ago ... serves me right for not paying
attention, I popped back in PoK at 0% of level 39 (Yay didnt lose my level)
never did it even occur to me to petition.

It was my dumb-arse mistake, I couldnt be bothered to re-lev myself and I
wasnt watching the screen, In the end I didnt even bother getting a rez at
all, I only lost 11 % at 39 thats like 11 kills.

On the plus side I got to watch my friend shot tea out his nose when he saw
me falling =) and it gave my guild a good laugh (isnt it nice to be loved)
