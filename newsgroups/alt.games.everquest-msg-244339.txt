Hi All;

I've been putting junk into tribute points and have about 11k worth now. In
a heavy usage situation I turn on FT4 (I have FT11).  But, I can't seem to
get excited about any of the other tribute abilities, probably because I
don't understand how they would benefit me and/or my group.  Maybe Improved
Healing IV for a 20% increase in instant heals and I'm not sure about that.
I already have the healing aa for a 20% increase in instant heals.

My question:  What are other clerics turning on in situations above a normal
XP grind?

Thanks to all in advance for you time and thoughts.
