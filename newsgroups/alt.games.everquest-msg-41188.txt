     The higher you get , the tougher it becomes to solo. There are many
blue mobs I can't solo successfully at this point but they are still out
there, but as a monk it's a little easier than most classes to find out if
you can solo something. Most classes have to be close to a zone line if they
want to survive an encounter they can't win. Monks just use their get out of
death free card and Feign. The trick is to find mobs you actually can solo
that are blue and stick with them for a while. I don't remember exactly what
I was fighting at 28 but I would imagine you could do well with the aviaks
in S Karana, the forest giants in Warsilik Woods, or the goblin mines in
LOIO.

    And if you can't solo, working as a Duo with the right partner will net
you much more experience usually than a full group. I recently teamed with a
lv 48 bard killing Hill Giants and we were killing so fast that even though
most were green I was gaining experience at a pretty good rate. We were
dropping a giant every two minutes with no pause at all in between except
for the time it took to find another and sometimes that was no time at all
if we got an add during the fight. My favorite partners are Shamans, Druids,
and Bards.

   Good luck, and hopefully you have saved at least 30 points to put into
Flying Kick. It rocks, but it's slow to raise at first because of the
relatively long delay.
