As a 65 cleric with ft 15 + 5 + 8 + 3 (emperor shawl, aoz, aa) plus
minimum c3 on adventures, it's not a big deal. However, I do remember it
being very noticable back in the days of doing exp in tier 2 PoP planes
like PoV and HoH when my mana regen was much more limited. 

I vaguely recall they were originally planning to add an 80% slow for
shamen back in PoP beta but people pointed out how much difference that
5% made in dps and they quickly ditched the idea.

Another factor is that shamen tend to take hits a bit better than
enchanters, so you also save a bit of mana there on the occasional early
agro from slow.

IMO, the biggest problem with all 3 slows is the amount they make a
slowing class required at the high end. SOE has had to assume a slower
in encounters, even dungeons, and because all three slows are so
powerful, just like cleric's complete heal,, they tune for slowed dps,
putting a group without a slower at a severe disadvantage.

In retrospect, I think they should never have allowed slows in the game
that reduced dps by more than 25% or so, so that mob damage wasn't
trivialized by having a slower if it was balanced for a group without
one.
