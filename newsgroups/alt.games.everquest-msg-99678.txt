This topic has been discussed before, and I understand that the
Freeport guards are on two seperate factions - NFP and EFP/WFP. I also
understand that for my dark elf shadowknight, getting decent EFP/WFP
faction is as easy as killing some orcs (did so - now I can run around
those parts of FP at my leisure). Getting decent NFP faction, as I
understand it, requires that I kill EFP/WFP guards - them being
corrupt and all.

My problem is that I am not a high enough level to consider fighting
guards. Is there any other way to improve NFP faction than by killing
EFP/WFP guards? Something a lower level player could do that is.

Thanks,
Rumbledor
