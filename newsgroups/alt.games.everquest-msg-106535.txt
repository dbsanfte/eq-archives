  You said it, "zone chat".  A general PvP discussion that has nothing
whatsoever to do with the zone isn't exactly "zone chat."  Why not move the
discussion into a chat channel called PvP?  You get rid of some of the
discussion that some people in the zone don't want to hear, and you enable
people to continue the discussion while they move outside the zone.
