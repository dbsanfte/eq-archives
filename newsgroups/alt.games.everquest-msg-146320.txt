    Too bad your level doesn't kill mobs. Your DPS does. DPS is uncapped -
people keep getting better and better weapons after they hit level 60.
There's reasons why a level 60 FoH monk can solo the entire Disco area in
Sebilis now, but could not back when Kunark was the current expansion.

    And that level of difficulty goes up as characters progress. These
changes were supposed to be a kick in the pants to people who'd progressed
well past the zones they liked to bottom-feed in. My guild's main tank
shouldn't be soloing the Drolvarg Captain camp in KC, he should be someplace
that's a challenge so that a group that's challenged by Drolvarg Captain can
move in there.

    Yeah, things like more HPs/better damage avoidance/better damage
mitigation/enhanced crits (especially for wizards) are all about raids.
/boggle.

    They have to group. Make the bonus sufficiently high on mobs that a
group, and only a group, can kill and people that want to be optimal will
group. Although there are exceptions like the soloable level 70 mob in
Shadow Haven with a fast respawn time. ;-)

    Or, they have to keep upgrading gear. Which is what the level 60's in
game now have been doing for two expansions. If the frogs in Sebilis were
considered well designed risk/reward for warriors with Jade Maces and
Lamentations, they shouldn't still be good risk/reward for warriors with
Blades of Carnage and Acrylia Handled Broadswords.
