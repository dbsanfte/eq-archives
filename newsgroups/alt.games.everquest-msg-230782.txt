hmm... the devil?

Naw, Yantis is a individal that owns numerous EQ sites.  To include
sites that auction plat and characters for real money.  He also
aquires various Class sites ( Monkly Buisness, EQBeastlords, and now
EQDruids as well) and gathers information from those sites and resells
them as Player Guides and get rich quick Plat guides on his Auciton
sites.   
To most who care about the state of EQ, and do not like EBay accounts.
Yantis is the Devil Incarnate.   It would be too kind to call him
Cazic Thule himself....
