Lol, thats a point, but no, I meant cheaper as in less exp cost to be one.  I looked
for a JBB for my shaman from level 30 to 51 and never saw one in the bazaar at any
price, so I assume if I wanted one I'd have to camp one, which would not cost any
cash particularly.  I have no idea how important they are really since I didn't have
one, didn't really feel the need but wanted to get one just to see.

Base wisdom isn't all that important, IMO, and the cudgel quest series can be done
for any race of shaman, just takes a little more work for non Iksar.   I don't know
anything about scaled mystic armor so can't speak as to the utility of that.
