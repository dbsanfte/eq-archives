snare=1st level spell that druids get. Makes them move slower. Lots of
classes get similar spells.
dot=Damage Over Time (an acronym). Not sure if wizards get any of these, but
druids,necros,shamans,enchanter,bards,SK (maybe more) do.
nuke=direct damage spell. Your speciality.
Kite=run around with the monster chasing you (or maybe chasing the monster)
