Amazingly dull. I dont play EQ, but let me comment on how you can
solve an EQ problem. Kill the scammer!

I dont diet, but let me comment on how you can solve a dieting
problem. Quit eating!
I dont work, but let me comment on how you can solve the employment
problem. Start working!

I never liked journalists who comment on things without doing a little
bit of research. He didn't even bother to look at a game synopsis, or
ask someone about the game. He just has all the answers.

Yantis once again comes off as a scam-master, a virtual Fagin (see
Oliver Twist) to thousands of kids in many games scamming plat for a
few bucks.
