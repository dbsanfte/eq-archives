Hell yeah, China will be a superpower soon, the biggest ever probably.
That's a scary thought. I doubt the US will ever fall like the British
Empire did because of a number of reasons:

1. Britain relied on other stolen countries for it's resources. When the
colonies were lost, the mainland coal mines couldn't provide coal at a price
that could compete with the rest of the world, and as a consequence the
government subsidised primary industry to keep our steel industry afloat.
Pretty soon it became unfeasible to keep the mines open and by that time
both Coal and Steel were severely damaged. America has plenty of it's own
resources that are much easier to mine than the narrow coal veins of the
British Isles so it's pretty safe there.

2. Mainland Britain was crippled economically by two huge wars, that also
killed much of it's male working population. The colonies were dissolved to
regain funds to pay war debts to the USA. Britain was still rationing food,
clothing, etc into the 1950's.

3. Technological advancements were no longer a main strength of Britain. The
USA was advancing at a much faster rate than us and far east countries like
Japan, China and Korea jumped onto the band wagon. That was the final straw
pretty much, they could make everything faster, cheaper and more advanced
than us and we lost much of our secondary industry. Although a lot of
technological innovations and research are still pioneered by Britain it is
usually for foreign companies that take them back to their own countries for
production.

4. Britain was based on old ideals that quickly became outdated by the
*then* freer thinking USA. Instead of welcoming new ideas for industry or
taking advantage of our strengths we tried to hold onto the idea that we
were still a superpower even though much of our territory was gone. We
concentrated on areas that we floundering rather than replacing them with
areas where we were stronger and tied up too much capital that could have
been spent elsewhere.

5. The 1980's saw a devastating recession in Britain, which (even though we
were forced to pay out ï¿½1.6billion on the Falklands) forced us to rethink
our spending budget. Our military took the brunt of that and our relations
with the USA mean we don't need the fighting force we once had. We became a
defensive country rather than an offensive one I supppose, helped by the end
of the Cold War. Personally I would put a bit more money into the defence
budget but that's not going to happen any time soon.

It makes me sad to see Britain as it is now but we're just a small island
and we have no need to try to become a superpower again. Our power was based
on military might and the land we had taken and we won't ever regain that so
we just have to move on, try to reform the country and keep doing what we're
doing pretty much. We offer the world support in conflicts and try to be a
good citizen globally with treaties and such. We're America's biggest ally
and I guess we're mostly happy with that role.

To be honest I'm pretty happy with it. There need to be a lot of changes
here but that's something that is hopefully going to happen with time
