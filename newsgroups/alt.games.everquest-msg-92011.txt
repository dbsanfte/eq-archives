Our guild currently has 2 level 60 warriors, a level 56, and four or
five level 51 to 54. One of the reasons we're not doing bigger raids
is that we don't have enough "defensive disc" warriors. Of all the
classes, warriors are the only one that can dual wield / double attack
and don't bleed like a ranger if they start to get hit.
