Yeah, things sure have changed in Lower Guk.  I have held the Sav, Cav, 
Sage, Exe cycle with a group, but only at very odd hours.  When I first 
started going to Guk, that was at least three camps during peak hours.  I 
hear horror stories about pre-kunark that would be 5 camps, the 4 named 
and a group camping the wanderers.
I was in Lower Guk with a guildie a couple weeks ago, there was a necro 
soloing the Frenzy room, and we basically had everything else on the lower 
level.  So nice to be in Guk without all the silly /ooc I remember.
