Actually, I remembered that, but I think everything actually called "root"
does work that way.  The druid spell is something like "ensnaring roots".

Basic root, as cast by Wizards and Clerics and Enchanters and whomever else
I'm forgetting is checked every tick.  I think the Druid spells are checked
at 1 tick, and then every 5 ticks.  Wizards, etc., get a second line of
roots that allegedly tend to last longer, but a lot of people believe that
is because the maximum length is longer, rather than giving less frequent
break checks to the mob like Druid's roots get.
