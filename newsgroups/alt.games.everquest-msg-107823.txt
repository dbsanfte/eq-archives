I solo'd level 35 with my warrior on the "a skeleton"s in Najena. (The
ones for the Ghoulbane quest.) They were still giving xp at 36.  You
could try there. Nothing else aggro's on you in the areas where they
are.

That said, I only did it out of sheer bloodymindedness to prove it could
be done, and it was incredibly stupid of me.  Go get a group. You're
soloing days are over and you're going to need to learn some group
skills soon.
