You can actually really pick whatever you want, cause any race is able
to fit exp groups just fine. As for the end game, it doesn't matter
either, since I've seen woodelf warriors (weak by starting stats) tank
the Vindicator and dragons just as well as most ogres. By that time,
some uber shaman will buff you to the smitherens anyways. You can
always even out your stats through good items. I geuss the middle game
without twink stuff is easier as an ogre and items, that have AC (go
for AC as warrior, period) that also has several stats on is very
expensive in most cases. I don't really know, how the distribution of
items for warriors to boost the various stats are .. maybe it's easy
to get STA/STR items.
