I really liked Cazic at 29 to 30+ and I never had a problem picking up a
group.  Sometimes early am on Eastern US time is tough, but still do-able.
(just med behind the tree in the court yard, or right near the zone line if
your alone)
SolA was fun, but those twisty turns and lava turned me off.  Definitely a
good place to go even if it is just to sight see. :)
From what I have read, Runnyeye is the new place to go for some nice
goodies, and pretty good cash, but the trains I have heard of are murder.
Paw is really nice, lots to be had, good cash, and good exp.
I have done Dalnir, and without Levitate on it could get ugly.  There are a
lot of critters down there.  But the brute caves that lead to Dalnir offer
great experience, and they don't aggro on eachother so you can kill them one
at a time and space them out so you have minimal down time to heal.
Good luck, where ever you decide to go.
