Sounds like what I heard. I wondered what their high level purpose will be
later. There's the /pet hold command now (don't remember if BST's get that
one earlier), which would ease the dungeon problems a bit. I'm not sure how
many high level raids happen in dungeons, but I'd think pet's might 
sometimes not be what people want around? If that's the case, the BST might
be fun at low level and totally screwed later.
