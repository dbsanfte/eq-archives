Exp will still be there tommorrow.
Exploring will still be there when you crawl out of bed on Saturday
morning.

Cursed and AoW will most likely be gone for a week if they aren't killed
patch day.

By raiding on patch day, you get to kill all the week long spawns. Then
you have days free for levelling or exploring. If you skip the patchday
spawns, someone else will kill them, and you get nothing.

If you've just joined a high level raiding guild, capable of taking down
cursed, I would advise you to keep your head down a little more for a
while. Officers have a hard enough time keeping the guild focussed at
times like this, and having a new member 'rocking the boat' because they
can't be bothered to wait a few hours, won't win you any friends.

We've cut back pre-PoP raiding to patchday cursed/emp/seru, and a
weendend single day VT clear. We too, have people whining about how they
want to grind to L65 asap. We also have people whining about not raiding
enough. Officers don't like people whining. Valid concerns, sure, but
once the decision has been made, and a valid reason for it, then shut up
and eat your pie. ):o)
