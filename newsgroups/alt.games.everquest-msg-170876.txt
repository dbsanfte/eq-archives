My Ogre Warrior had 700ish HP at level 19.  Sitting regen is 20 HP
per minute at 19.  It's fairly easy for a Warrior to have 2000ish
HP in upper 40s with sitting regen at 30HP per minute, even with
bandaging to half you've got 30 minute wait if you need to be near
full HP to engage a mob.  As for casters, my 33 Druid takes over
10 minutes to med from empty to full, so if I'm the healer in a
group and a fight leaves the melees badly beat up and me at or near
OOM it could easily take more than 15 minutes until we're near
full strength again.  I'm not convinced that this is necessarily
an intrinsicly bad thing (though given xp awards, death penalties,
and the general setup of most places in EQ it's definitely far
from wonderful), but his 30 minutes is hardly far enough from
truth to qualify as "lame", IMO.
