Yet another in the long series of "what would go well with..."
questions: A friend of mine and I are going to be starting characters to
play together pretty much exclusively. He is going to play an Enchanter
(race undecided). We both want to play good characters (as opposed to
evil). Neither of us have any real experience playing pure casters, so
we're not sure what would go well with an enchanter. Any thoughts? Also,
any recommendations for what races do well as enchanters?

Thanks in advance.
