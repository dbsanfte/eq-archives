In halflife:

It doesn't take you several weeks-to-months of tedium to reach PvP ability.
You don't have to run for a half hour plus to get back to where you were
before you were PKd.
Nobody is innately more powerful than you are...skill and connection are
the relevant factors.
You KNOW you are going to be attacked in half life, it is the entire
purpose of the game. You might go several days in the frontier and never
see someone from another realm...that leads to complacency and death when
someone decides to play william tell and not aim for the apple.
Half life does not feature 20 v 1 gang bangs, DAoC will. A lot.
In half life, if someone performs some decisive action against your team,
it only affects you for that game, and usually not even that long. If
another realm captures one of your realm relics, YOUR WHOLE REALM IS FUCKED
until/unless you can get it back. Want to have every single character in
your realm get 10% less xp than normal? Just wait for the powerlevelers in
a different realm to hit level 40 and grab all the relics before anyone in
your realm is above level 20 and able to defend yourselves. That gives the
other realm a 20% swing in the rate they will gain xp. +10% for them for
having your relic, -10% for you for not having yours.

The only high level game is RvR...if that isn't fun, then you have
completely wasted all the time getting there.
