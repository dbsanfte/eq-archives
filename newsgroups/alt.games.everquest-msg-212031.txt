The reason the warrens, pc, and befallen have such high ZEM's is because
they are sub 30 dungeons; that made them part of the upgrades to make
dungeons more appealing to the under 30 crowd.

The reason it's important to remember that a ZEM is a whole number goes
back to the formula for base xp from a mob -

Mob_level^2 * ZEM

Given the xp to get through level x is
x^3 * 1000 * Some_multiplier (1.1 at 30, 1.2 at 35 and 1.3 at 40 if
my memory serves me)

We have a level 40 elemental warrior (the average, they seem to be 39-41)
giving
40^2 * 100 = 160,000

For the enchanter I was pl'ing there, xp to get through 41 is
89,597,300
To get through 40 is 
83,200,000
the xp to get from 41 to 42 is
6,397,300

160,000/6,397,300 = 2.5% of a level a kill

This matches my experience - I saw mostly 2%'s alternating with
3%'s while PL'ing my enchanter in the Hole.
