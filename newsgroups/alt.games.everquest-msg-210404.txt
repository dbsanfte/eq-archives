I guess if this were the real world "twinking" is when daddy buys you a 
ferrari for your birthday, right? or maybe some rich stranger bumps into 
you at the mall and hands you the keys...

Then, by your logic, if daddy makes you clean clean up the garage, take 
out the garbage, and recycle the bottles first -- before he gives you 
that ferrari... well then its ok, because now you've earned it.

That's what the bazaar is. A bunch of rich old folks with more money 
than bank space, looking to unload their older ferraris to make some 
room, willing to give them to any 4 year old who can handle cleaning the 
newbie yard.

If that's not twinking, its something equivalent.
