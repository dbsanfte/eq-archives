Oh, yes, and the above is specifically one of the things you do.  When you
give another player a job, you can choose to have them place a "bond", a sum
of money that they'll get back when they finish the job.  If they rip you
off, that bond is immediately placed as the price on the person's head, and
any interested bounty hunter can take the job, kill the guy, steal his
money, and take the bounty.
