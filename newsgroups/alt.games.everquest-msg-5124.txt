Not long at all! I read every word. Aye, it was in UnRest, the room with the
patio.  I went up the stairs, crept ever-so-close to a carrion ghoul, waited
until he jumped me and ran back to my group, thinking that I was pulling
successfully! NOT! You guessed it, I aggro'd the Entire house!  I announced
to the zone it was my fault too... DOH!

Needless to say, I don't want to do THAT again...
