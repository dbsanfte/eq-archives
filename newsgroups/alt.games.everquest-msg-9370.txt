any  giant in ew, gd, ic, kael, wl,will give u both dorf and dragon.   to
get yelinak and dain you have 2 options.

option 1: do quests
option 2: hunt tormax area  in kael.   you dont have to kill tormax hijmself
to get the faction, just his henchmen.

btw, if you  arent 55+, i wouldnt suggest using the tormax  area option.
