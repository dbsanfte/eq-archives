I was at work :-)

What does that have to do with it? How many Americans are at work or Uni at
3am EST???

Since I got home at 6pm (BST) and the servers should have come back by 7pm
but I was still unable to get back on line at 10pm I think I have a
reasonable gripe.

That's a side issue, the fact that after a big patch, it is often 24 hours
before I can log back on.

Regardless of who suffers, whether its european or asian players, the fact
that some one suffers is a good reason to stagger patches. Other games do
big patches like this over consecutive days or weeks, that way a player can
have characters on multiple servers, and be able to play when they want,
with the inconvenience of having to use a different character, maybe.

I understand the need to patch, and the fact that there are so many actually
shows that VI are still showing an active interest in promoting the game,
and a concern for problems that are reported. I just think it could be
handled better, say a 5 hour patch every fortnight, instead of a 10 hour
patch every month?
