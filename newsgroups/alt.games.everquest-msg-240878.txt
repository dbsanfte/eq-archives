Possible.  Personally, I've never had a GM show up and ask me stupid 
trivial questions.  I've definitely heard of GMs responding to situations 
unreasonably, though.

I think this one's my favorite:
}>}}Or /tt target one... what is 6 x 5? wait for 
}>}}/tt target two...  and that divided by 10 is?

Ok... you caught me.  I'm botting a character.  Ummm... so?  Plenty of 
folks bot without using macro programs.

The point is, how often have you seen GMs come in and try to 'trip you 
up'?  Wouldn't you feel justly annoyed if they did this while you were 
trying to take down a challenging target?  I know I would.  And I suspect 
they know that, too.  Thus, they generally don't administer 'are you 
paying attention?' spotchecks, especially when someone may already be 
spammed or tellbombed by say, for example, a raid.  Usually, if someone 
has petitioned something, they will try to figure out who the leaders of 
the two raids are, and talk to them.  In general, they probably won't 
punish the -entire- raid, just because they came in in the middle of 
Farglik's leet cyb0r session and got a mistell...  Or because 
raid_drone_006 missed the GM tag and was a bit cheeky... And this gives 
joe_raid_programmer_01 plenty of time to alt-tab to the appropriate window 
to respond.
