Well, that's always true, of course, but there's a difference
between (to oneself) "Sheesh, shouldn't have responded to
this offer for a port; this is way beyond cheap" and (to the
other party) "don't insult me."   I see one as just learning
not to clarify price before services are agreed upon and the
other as just rude.

But, as an example, since the one actually doing the service
gets to determine what's reasonable, is it okay for my cleric
to always respond to rez requests from druids in CS or TD
with "Sure, 2kpp."  That's *reasonable*, right?  And no one's
going to argue that's too much, I'm sure.  After all, if I'm the
only visible 56+ cleric online except for a couple of 60s in
nToV or Ssra...
