Hm. I had trouble staying away from him with SoW up *after* Ensnaring
him. The bastard is *fast*.

I'm thinking that the most viable method of soloing him would be
straight kiting. If Ensnare lands, just keep casting Stinging Swarm and
running around. Of course, one third of the damage goes to waste, but
this is probably better than wasting all your mana casting Terrorize
Animal and having it resisted.
