Just an FYI, if you are doing tailoring only for the shawl quests, the
general consensus seems to be you will get your shawl quicker if you don't
bother, and just try the combines.  There is a 2% to 5% success rate, even
at extremely low tailoring skill, and if you fail, you do get to keep the
shawl you used in the combine, you just have to get the rest of the
ingredients again.  (I know, those ingredients are a pain in the butt, but
compare that to farming greens for weeks to get drops to get your tailoring
skill up high enough).  Take a gander at the message boards on eqtraders.com
for information on this.  Whatever you do though, don't post a "How do I get
tailoring up high enough for the shawl quests, I don't really give a damn
about tailoring" post.  They are not met with any kind responses in general.
That being said, I am busily getting my tailoring up high enough anyway,
what can I say, I'm a masochist.
