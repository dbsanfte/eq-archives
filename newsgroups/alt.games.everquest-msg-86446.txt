Dont even bother wasting points on ANY tradeskills, they all go up easily
enough at the low levels where you *can* use training points (only up to 21,
then you have to "learn in the field").   Exception of course is Jewelcraft
since its so fecking expensive to raise at ANY level.  (unless you hunt in
Xorbb for bars and get crap gems in normal hunting at least).  Oh, and I
would imagine alchemy is also a good choice for points, but I've never had a
shaman high enough to do it so I don't really know.
