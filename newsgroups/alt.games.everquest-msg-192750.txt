    Don't know if you mean greens or XP-giving mobs, I'll mention both.

    In the way of greens, mow down goblins in Sol A. Lots of cash and fine
steel drops, and the vendor is conveniently located in the dungeon. I can
think of other greens with excellent drops, but they would mostly be good
race folks and I know you won't kill them for RP reasons.

    Blues? I'd think that you could solo stuff in the back of Sol B, given
that you have slow and a pet. If you can kill the LDCs, then not only can
you get the standard amount of plat off them, but 1-4 Spider Silks. Given
how much silks sell for these days, that's a fair chunk of change.

    If you can kill any of the humanoid mobs there (and that's a big if - I
think you'd need to be grouped), the stuff in LoY is excellent cash. For
example, the trolls I kill in Nadox. Most are green to me, with the odd
light blue, so I'd guess they're high 40's to very low 50's in level. Each
one drops 7-8 pp, possible gems (Fire Opals are the best gem on the custom
table they use), possible Zraxthil weapons, and the odd droppable item that
sells for a good chunk of change to a vendor. There's also, depending where
you set up, lots of "easy" droppables like Coral Rings, Ceremonial Hate
Candles, and the like that the group will quickly fill up on. If you had
friends, or once you get much higher in level, the place will become a cash
cow for you. You might be able to get a pick-up group in Dulak, I'm not
certain.
