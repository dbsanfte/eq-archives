I've always disliked it when people punt Gnomes -- Such a waste of
perfectly good food ........

mmmmm, Gnome sirloin chops.  Rub them with a little olive oil,
salt and pepper than toss a fire ball at them.  Of course, Bos
is a bit less civilized about it - he likes his rare to the 
point of still squirming.

The other nice thing about Gnomes is there's usually plenty left to
share with the pets.
