It took me forever to figure this one out.  Now bear with me, I just do this
stuff automaitcally in game.  If you want to send a message to someone who
has ALREADY sent you a TELL here is what you do.  Without hitting enter or /
hit either r or t (sorry, I always forget with letter it is, just do it
automatically when playing).  You will then see /tell PlayerName okay at
this point hit shift+tab and this will take you through all the names of
people who have sent you tells.  Oh yes you have to keep hitting shift+tab
to switch to next name.  Now when you have the name just type your message.
I know it is not a macro, but it is the second best thing.  I did some
reserch on making a macro like you described about a year ago and from what
I found it is not possible.
I hope that made sence and that I got all the keystrokes right.
If not send me and e-mail at maiddaraya@yahoo.com and I will write down what
I am doing while in the game and send that to you.
