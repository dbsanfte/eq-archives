 Backweb agent is a program used by some manufactures and also a stand alone
program to search for updates for your PC in the background while you are on
the web, so it doesn't disturb your browsing. Compaq uses it in their
service connection. McAfee used to use it also. If you  close the programs
in your system tray before signing into the game, it should solve the
problem.
