Logged in this morning to do a quick check for Froglok
Ton Warriors (Iksar Illusion Quest) and when to cast a
spell (#4) that I had mapped to Alt-q (second mapping)
and  nothing happened.
I dropped back to the staple Alt-4 and that worked.
Spell went off, frog went dead!
So, investigating my keys I found that all my ALT-[X]
keys in the secondary command listing were changed
to SHIFT-[X].
I was wondering if anyone else has seen this?
