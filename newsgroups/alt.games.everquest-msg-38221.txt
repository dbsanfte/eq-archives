Okay, if you see anyone perpetrating deliberate misspellings of any word, I
advise you to follow the Nevers: 1) Never group with them; 2) Never listen
to a thing they say; 3) Never buff or heal them; and 4) Never give them
anything.  I'm sure there are a couple of people who use d00dspeak while
maintaining a modicum of intelligence but the majority of those who use it
are 13-year-old buttwads who will shout "[your character's name, misspelled]
SUXX0RS!" if you refuse to heal, buff, port, or otherwise assist them.

Common d00dspeak terms:
1337    pronounced "Leet," means elite
ph47    pronounced "phat," means great, awesome
13vv7    pronounced "lewt" means loot
haxx0r    means hacker; d00ds think using this word makes them one
roxx0r    means "rocks" which means "is excellent"
suxx0r    means "sucks"
u    means "you," not really d00dspeak but there isn't a one of them who
doesn't use it
plz    supposed to mean "please," but what it really means is "or I'll keep
bugging you"
!!!1!!1!    this is a d00dspeak exclamation point

Note: add z instead of s to conjugate or pluralize (sp?) these words, ex.
"d00d, that suxx0rz!  u need ph47 13vv7z!"
