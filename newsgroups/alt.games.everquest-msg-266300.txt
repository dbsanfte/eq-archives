Their response above was after me telling him many, many, many times 
that I was being followed around and didn't appreciate it. He just 
kept repeating the "party line"

This was my final response after dealing with a CS person doing a very 
nice impression of a brick.

I didn't? I guess if you say so.

How many times do you have to explain something to someone who is not 
listening? Oh, wait a minute, this thread answers that question quite 
well.

LOL, this wasn't a neighbor, this was a moron following me around and 
that was explained in no uncertain terms. The CS person kept repeating 
the same line.

Glad you think it went down that way, did the tooth fairy leave you a 
quarter last night?

As much as I'm laughing now from my Berlin hotel room?

I really can't believe this thread has gone on as long as it has. I 
will take some of the responsibility for this as I should have 
detailed the conversation line by line as it transpired. Everyone has 
a frustration threshold beyond which you know any further discussion 
is futile. This is my last word on this. Now back to work.
