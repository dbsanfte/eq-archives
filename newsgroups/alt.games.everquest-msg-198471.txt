Shamen (Shamani?) may do best in trials without the traditional group,
but with a more AE-based approach. Before the pet aggro changes, my
guild fronted a group was Shaman, Cleric, Enchanter, Mage, Wizard,
Wizard. AE Slow, AE Stun, pet tank, AE nuke, and Banish Summoned got
that group through the first four waves five times, lost to the Prime
Executioner four times, and eventually got them flagged.

If you have a shaman in the trials group, it's probably best to go
without an enchanter and to have a warrior tank. AE slow means that
you're probably going to have to tank a fair amount of the time
anyway. Even superior paladin/SK taunting tactics only work on one MOb
at a time.

There's no shame in going out of guild for trials help. I can't think
of a single big guild on Torv that I didn't group with for trials at
one time or another.
