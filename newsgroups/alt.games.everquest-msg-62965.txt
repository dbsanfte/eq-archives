I'll know about that in about 3 hours when I get there and check it out. I
told them NOT to install the DX8, but naturally, they never listen ("..but
the attachment said 'open me' so I did..."). So, I won't know until I get
there as they often tell me they didn't when in fact they *did*...


But these are the same people who insist that installing any other software
or games on their system will "break" EQ, install it anyway, download 20
gigs of porno, spyware and other crap, "break" EQ with some offbeat DLL,
call me and then uninstall it all before I get there, where I find it
sitting neatly in the recycle bin. I then here "the kids (ages 4 & 6)  must
have done it!" :-)

The *other* half of the time, their "major crisis" is "normal" windows
behavior. I sometimes wonder why I do this to myself, but it does keep the
rent paid and *someone* has to do it!
