Whoa...maybe that was a bit whiney. (Note to self...less beer and more sleep
makes for better posts.) Sorry for being a jackass lastnight. I went back
out and created a new character. Hopefully I will get a chance to see all of
you that tried to help ground me, and not give up too soon. I can't believe
I was such a weenie!

On the bright side...I am now seeing that there are people that actually
give a damn. In between the shots of 'toughen up' I got some great URL's.
Time to start reading.

Thanks,
Knightsend
