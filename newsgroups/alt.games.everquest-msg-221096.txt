Both sets of figures are correct.  They're just not for the same thing.  

The BCS report (http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/bcs1.htm) shows 
~50,000 sexual offences from April 02 to March 03 reported to local 
constabularies.  These are official figures.

In the UK, downloading child porn, under age sex, flashing, rape, 
pinching someone's ass and various other offences fall into this 
category.  The proportion of those figures which are actually rapes is 
vastly smaller.

The Home Office Research Study 
(http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/hors237.pdf) only has factual 
figures up until 1999, and shows (as reported to police and recorded 
via the exact same mechanism) 7,809 rapes in 1999.  Look at appendix E.  

So both sets of figures can be completely coherent with each other.  
The other point is that they are only the reported crimes, and one of 
the key reasons for the home office paper was the belief that by far 
the majority of this type of crime goes unreported.  The same is true 
in the US.  The main cause of this is the personal anguish that a 
prosecution causes the victim, and the low success rate.

Rape is vastly lower in the UK than it is in the US.  The same is true 
of all of Europe.

Regarding the gun argument, it's pretty circular.  Because the US has 
made it so easy in the past for criminals to get guns, ordinary 
citizens need them.  There is no way to remove guns from circulation, 
therefore people have to have the means to defend against them.

In the UK, guns are almost completely illegal.  We've never had 
anything like the level of gun crime there is in the US.  The 
unfortunate side affect of other countries providing easy access to 
weapons however is that they get brought into countries that don't.

Gun crime in the UK is increasing dramatically.  We have a shooting 
making the news nearly every week here now.  Although, a shooting is 
still unusual enough to make the national news which should illustrate 
the point.

My view is that in the rape scenario, a rapist who knows exactly what 
they intend to do is more likely to have a gun because they have 
prepared, and a victim is less likely to.  I would prefer therefore 
that guns remain illegal in the UK.  Making guns illegal in the US 
won't practically solve the gun crime problems there since everone

And just for the record, leaving the "gang and drug related" gun crime 
out of any discussion on the subject would completely invalidate any 
argument.
