Well, you do have to switch out from inventory.  However, like pretty much
everything else in the game, there's nothing stopping you from making an
inventory slot a HOTBUTTON.  So just click on the inventory slot and hold
the mouse button down until the window pops onto your cursor, then click it
onto your hotbutton palette.
