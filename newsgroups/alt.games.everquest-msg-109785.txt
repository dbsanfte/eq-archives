What's you DEX? Consider raising that stat to have your Waki (you really
should have a Yak or better by now) proc more often (a 6/22 weapon IS a bit
feeble if you want to be MA, unless you can get more Procs out of it).

Rule of thumb for Warriors... AC is King! Go for high AC over any stat.
Find at least one weapon that does a lot of damage per second (Icetooths
really isn't going to cut it at this level) that can HOLD a mobs attention
(procs help, but are unreliable... concentrate on getting as BIG a weapon as
you can).

With your current gear, first priority should be a high dam/sec weapon
(2-hander, possibly, but a good 1-hander will do)... Followed by better AC,
some kind of Haste item (FBSS are getting real cheap again), better resists,
more HP, and finally better stats in the order STR, STA, DEX then AGL.

Basically... a weapon will do twice its listed damage plus one point...
multiplied by a percentage of your ATK factor. I don't know the exact
formula, but I suspect it's been parsed/worked out somewhere. Crits and
Crippling Blows damage are, again, percentage multiples of your base damage.

Your ATK factor is based mainly on your Offence skill, your Weapon skill,
and a multiplier based on STR. There are a couple of jumps in the scale
where at some levels your ATK (if maxxed) will push you up to the next grade
(level 30, I think, is the first big jump).
