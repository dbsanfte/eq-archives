Can't answer for you specific card, I have a Geforce 2 MX400.  I have
downloaded the very lates drivers from NVIDIA for that, same ones as for
your card I think, not certain.  I am using DX8.  I have no problems with it
now, the prior drivers from NVIDIA were a major problem for me with DX8, but
worked fine with DX7.  I believe the version of the drivers I now have is
21.84, not certain about that though.
