Just when I thought EQ had become a grinde...

Played last night and whilst wondering around I received a tell asking
me to join a group to go to Kaesora hey why not was my reply - but I
am only 32 I replied and with little experience in the game - thats ok
just come over was the response. So I made up the last member of 40+
people - they probably needed a member the mobs could beat up and they
could heal quickly - well I came with a pet as well so what the hell.

In we went clr,pal,dru,shm,shm and me - ok probably not the best group
ever. I ran in the frenzied room like an idiot end up stuck to the
floor big spider eating me well I died. Any way got rezzed twice
unfortunatly to the same spot which wasnt a great idea as there was a
huge spider eating me alive again, so we scrapped that idea and
decided that I should run in, we eventually got to the Library where
we meet up with a 60 bst. The bst kindly pulls mobs one by one for us
for a good hour and we beat them to death. He leaves we carry on only
interesting bit our puller brings more than one at a time which was
fun. Anyway Druid dies and someone had to leave we then decide to
leave so we get ported to the gate by the cleric I think and we part
leaving the casters to collect the druid.

Point is:-
Just when I thought it had become tedious I met a few people out there
who  are good, and didnt whine about the mistakes I made and didnt
care too much about my level - they just enjoyed the game and got on
with it. Stay around long enough and these people will show up - not
everybody in the game is a social moron - if you have met one or more
carry on and ignore them!
