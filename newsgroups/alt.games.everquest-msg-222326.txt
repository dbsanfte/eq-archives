Last night I was fooling around hunting kodiaks, accidentally
aggroed Bloodmaw, and decided to gate (I really don't have the
mana to keep my pet alive long enough to kill that guy!).  I'm
bound in POK... but disconnected.  Repeatedly got the "you have
an active character" message, finally got that to stop but when I
tried to log in, disconnected again.  Well, its late, so off I go
to bed.  Get up this morning though, same thing.  Eventually I
try chat, asking if POK is down  on FV or something.  People on
there don't know of any such problem... of course its been a long
time since chat included tech GMs, who won't be on till Monday 9
am pacific IF they aren't on fire at the time.  But since there
aren't hordes of FV people making the same complaint, I don't
really need a GM to tell me somethings wrong on my end.

I go to Morel-Thule and discover that my characters in POK can't
log in there either, but one in Great Divide can.

So I exit out to desktop, haul up windows explorer, delete
everything in my folder with the name poknowledge in it and log
back in.  Patcher gets the files replaced, and I'm in, in POK. 
Rapidly I get an LDoN call, before I've even finished my start of
the day summons... which on only 50% mana is a squeeze anyway. 
Off to BB where it ends up taking about half an hour to actually
get moving, but we manage to get it together, finish our run with
about 25 minutes to spare, open up a couple barrels... then time
to go back to BB to split the loot, and heck, why not stick
together and do it again now that we know each other and how to
work together well.  

Boom, disconnect again.

How can I be corrupting just the POK files?

Sigh.  Well, I had some this and that to do, and I tried it a few
more times, but I guess its time to wipe them all again and
restart.  But if it happens a third time, then what... stay out
of POK for the rest of my virtual life?
