Or in more contemporary taste, "My Immortal" by Evanescence.

Sorry, necros.

"Lay your hands on me" by some other Whitesnake-esque  band (white lion? 
bon jovi? the mind reels)

Mama put these swords in the ground, I can't jolt them anymore...

How about "The Warrior" (god knows which 80's one-hit-wonder...)

Any of the Klingon drinking songs one hears at cons would be lovely too.

Mage: "Ring of Fire", Johnny Cash (in honor of the group DS)

Shaman: No clue.
