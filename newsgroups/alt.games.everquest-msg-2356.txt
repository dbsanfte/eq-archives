Have to say I only mildly care and that's because I had hoped that
with UO's d00d appeal gameplay combined with PhAt GraPhicS would help
suck the remaining d00ds from EQ to UO2.

Having played UO; if there is a hell out there, it will be like my UO
experience. The game itself was ok, but the social retards you are
forced to deal with make the experience miserable. Basically, I don't
care how fantastic the game would have looked, a combination of UO's
lax enforcement and a mass quantity of a-hole wannabe virtual ganstas
would have sucked out all desire to play that game.

Better yet, maybe somebody woke up to the fact that most servers on EQ
are non-PvP and why would a majority of online players who enjoy this
sort of play fork out another 10 bucks a month to play in a world
where only 1/3rd of it would be non-PvP. I think EA figured out that
it's as much about the exploiting, PKing, cracking, macros,
free-for-all as it is about the latest software.

What they really need to work on is figuring out how one can be a kewl
d00d with a kewl d00d house, horse, pet, and no lag. Forget new
graphics, get the old game working.
