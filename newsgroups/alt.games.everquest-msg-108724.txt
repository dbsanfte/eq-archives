Well, here's the answer (as far as I can tell right now). I fiddled with the
Datarate.txt was set at 7.0 lowered it to 6, 5 and 4 had lockups all the
time, set it back to 7.

I went to everquestlive.com and searched for the problem, found their info
on >512MB memory problem made setting like they suggested. Had lockups all
the time, changed it back to default.

Finally, I opened the case and played EQ with the case off. I have had no
lockups since that time. That's been 4 days now with no lockups (including a
Fear raid where EVERYONE went LD, I was still there (well, I died, but I
DIDN'T go LD)).

After 4 days of intense play, I'm ready to say it was heat, just like Sean
suggested. But it seems to be Heat combined with something strenuous that EQ
does at the same time.

Thanks for the help!
