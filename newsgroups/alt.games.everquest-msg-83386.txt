Oh, and by the way, you never answered my question.  If
a blastula is a "human being," is a single blastula that
will develop into twins one "human being," or is it two
"human beings" in one body?

You never addressed the parasitic twin scenario I 
gave.  Is that foot a "human being" from the time
of fertilization?  Is is "murder" to remove it?  Is
that torso?  Is that almost-complete fetus?  Is that
anencephalic that is not a parasitic twin?

If the anencephaphalic parasite is not "human" but
the non-parasite is "human," what distinguishes the
two?

If you are going to claim that a zygote is a "human being"
from conception then you have to address this.  Otherwise,
you are just blowing smoke.
