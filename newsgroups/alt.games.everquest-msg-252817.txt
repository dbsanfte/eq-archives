Only because of his inexperience or because he's just a tad too low. As 
he gains a level or two his charms, nukes, & dots will stick ever 
better, and risk will drop to 0. And he'll still only have to kill <20% 
of each -running- mob to get the xp.

If the charm gets resisted he misses the xp for the kill. That is hardly 
a 'risk'.

An enchanter? AE stun, mez. memblur. med. Add dealt with. And that's 
only if the lulls got resisted and multiple mobs aggro in the first place.

he'd be pulling from long range; something would have to go very badly 
for him to die on the way to the gaurd.

A few nukes and dots on low-health running mobs? Presumably from nearly 
full mana.

That doesn't mean its not an exploit.

I don't *think* its a bannable offense though. But calling it a 
'legitimate tactic' is pretty weak too.
