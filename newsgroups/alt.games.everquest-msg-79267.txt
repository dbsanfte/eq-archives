Shhhh

It's a game, chill a little, count to ten then post. This is not my opinion
but it is an opinion voiced by many and if I am an idiot please do yourself
a favour, suffer me no more and filter me, Freeman, 2 E's

My opinion of it is simple, I have none. My Druid is 48th, my Nec 44 and my
main only 51. Even if I were to reach the levels that would make me viable
for such raids (and the fact that this will probably never happen bothers me
not) I'd not be attending any as I do not have the time or, to tell the
truth, the dedication to put in. That others do, I do consider commendable
in a way but that these people can get so strung out about it, well....
