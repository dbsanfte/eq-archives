99% of clerics spend nothing of their own income on gems, other than the
very first outlay.  They get dibs on gems in Seb to cover costs, or cash in
HS/wherever to recover costs.   Rezzing can be very profitable.. probably
second only to porters

I thought that was druids.

Monks have no real money making methods, but early on our gear requirements
are very low.   I went my first 45 levels without ever looting a mob for pp,
not like it really mattered.. sure my gear sucked ass (cured silk, crescent
armour) but things like fungis were 100kpp+ back then
