I'd rather see people do a simple quest, that gets them to a zone they 
didn't see. If the game has to reward the player to motivate them so be 
it... it benefits the game long term because then I won't have to group 
with idiots who don't know how to zone farther than the pok books go, 
and who have seen only 7 zones from 1 to 60.

And a few hundred pp??...farming some spider silks will get you cash as 
fast. So its not like I'm looking for an excuse to reward players with 
pp. I'm looking to give players something rewarding to do that is 
hopefully slightly more fun and entirely less menial.
