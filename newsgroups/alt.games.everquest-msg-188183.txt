Well that is a relief. Test is always going up and down. But on the
same token, Test is going up and down enough that its extremely
unlikely anyone was in there since the last downtime, which was last
night. If a revenant got up there without any player being involved,
couldn't this happen again and again? I am still a bit worried its a
new mob, especially since it was moving around. Most of the time a
bugged mob just stands in place or runs into a wall. He was distinctly
pathfinding.

I have been there a number of times before, but never for experience
(and not even remotely recently). Epics etc.
