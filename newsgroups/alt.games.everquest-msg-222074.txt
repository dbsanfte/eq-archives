    My vote would be PoN if you can find a competant group. I found that PoD
mobs have too many freakin annoying habits and PoI a little to
claustrophobic with near-compulsory near-guaranteed-fatal adds.

    Of the three I think PoN, depending on where you camp I guess (i loved
the waterfall for sheer convenience), is more forgiving of people still on
the learning curve who aren't a time guild's alt with a time guild's alt's
gear.

Cheers,
James
