  I have to admit I watch X Play religiously, have it tivoed and
everything.  For what it's worth, the quality of this show, and I think
*only* this show, survived the merger intact. 	They reviewed EQII at 4
stars out of five, WoW at 5 out of 5, and CoH at 3 out of 5.  WoW also
won their MMORPG of the year award.  Their observations of all three
games pretty much jives with the general consensus that I've been
reading in the various gaming forums that I visit.

  I like the old Screen Savers.  A low budget little show that didn't
look flashy, but offered some good information in a fun format.  Now
that's its been done over in super-slick "aren't we so terribly cool" G4
format it's almost painful for me to watch.  And I really miss the edgy,
bad taste exuberance that was Unscrewed with Martin Sergeant.  It was
the third highest rated show on the merged network, but they killed it
because it was just not up to the fluff standard that G4 seems to
embrace to heartily.
