Pentium still has the performance edge over athlons but athlons are the
better buy for the price.
I agree, no mention of the mobo makes me cringe at the thought of some PC
Chips mobo...eugh.
Asus, Abit or at least Gigabyte...wouldn't trust anyone else.

Eww onboard anything I stay well away from. Rather spend the 10 or 15 quid
on a low end sound Sound Blaster or equivalent. On board sound is often
CMedia and I haven't many good words to say about their chipsets.

I don't think I could have a PC without a floppy, still far to
useful..although I must admit, I only use it for booting from and the like
as well.
