I was a bit off on my numbers, I just checked, completely unbuffed I'm at 
1166AC.  I did gain a bit more than 200hp yesterday though, thanks 
Chestplate of Vindication and Troubadour Crown.  Now that my unbuffed STA 
is above 100, I'm a real tank.  Woot!

However, in true dumb bard fashion I was so excited about getting the new 
BP that I immediately died.  I know better than to go exploring on raids, 
but figured we were done, and had some energy to work off.  Get a tell 
from loot coordinator to get the BP, let out a hearty Woot!, and walked 
right into a Protector of Zek.  I think anger at seeing me get excited 
over taking his the BP off of his dead comrade over-rode my Ally faction, 
because he jumped me HARD.  /gu Thanks for the BP guys, can I get a rez?

Arolpin
