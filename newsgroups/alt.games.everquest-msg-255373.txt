Grin.  I can remember the first time I saw a *mud pet*.  I tried to attack him!
 It's master informed me they'd been in the game for *a long time*.  I laughed
and responded "I don't get into town much".  It was the truth.  (I musta
upgraded my computer or video card or something.... or maybe it had just been a
long long time since I had to venture into *civilization*.  Honestly, that's
probably it.)

Hail and well met Crash!  My ranger was my *first* and has lived much like
yours :)  
She has seen and done more *excitement* than all my other characters put
together, but alas, you are right.
I think the first blow was when I spent *****all***** my money on a really
*nice* bow and found out that even though I was a master at archery and
50-something I still sucked.  Bad enough that I sucked, but when I asked *here*
what I was doing wrong I got BERATED for not being uber enough to realize how
much I sucked and that it was my own fault for expecting too much without
having to **work** for it!!!!!!  You can google it.  I'm still saddened by the
reality of it.
(Sarcastic Bitterness On: Because, of course, without being 65 and having TS
and a bunch of AAs you *are* going to suck if you are a ranger.  I want someone
to tell me how you can solo to 65 and get TS, untwinked.  I thought rangers
were *known* for being loners????  Oh, and your untwinked armor sucks too, BTW.
Duh.
Over, done with, gone.)  
I should just delete this post rather than send it, but the ranger in me is
still alive and well...
and hiding in the forest, waiting for the PTB to wake up.
