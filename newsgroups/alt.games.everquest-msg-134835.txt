Yes, it is, as near as I can tell, objective and not biased.  It may have 
other flaws, though, like that it only demonstrates correlation and not 
causation, as I remember.  I'd have to do some serious digging to find it 
again.  I wouldn't necessarily take it as proof, but it's pretty 
substantial evidence.

So what's the malarky side got?
