Well, yes, ToV was simple to get to unless you are a total idiot...  I 
have made the run, without any porter the whole way in the past (to WW, 
need velium hounds).  It's really not difficult at all.  For raids it's 
even simpler, Druid/Wizards get full groups, succor across SG, people 
invis/levi, and run to ToV.  A number of folks, like me, just run across 
SG rather than wait on a succor, as we know the way, and it's really not 
a hard run to make, never once have I died doing it.  If the dragon is up 
at the ToV entrance, then run fast, and click in. :b  (OK, actually, set 
up a CoTH group with a nonKoS mage at the ToV zone in, and just CoTH 
people from SG zone line to ToV zone in.  I've done that a few times too, 
again, never died doing it (including several runs past the dragon while 
I was KoS).  This was all done at levels from the high 50s (pre PoP) to 
the mid 60s.

Seriously though, so long as people listened, it was really quite trivial 
to do the run.

Port in to Cobalt Scar, get SoE/Invis, run to SG, Succor/Evac across, 
zone out, CoTH to ToV, zone in.  I admit, we have a few folks in the 
guild who somehow managed to mess even that simple process up.
