My adventures of last night:

I spent an hour and a half trying to get the patch. It quit after 1/3
was done, then it stopped patching after 2/3 was done. After watching
the patch bar not budge for 15 minutes, I asked someone who'd patched
earlier if he could get me the gequip file; downloading it from him
took me less than 20 minutes.
Stonebrunt patch? I haven't even downloaded the Warrens...

Now, after I got online I was kind of annoyed at having wasted half my
play time with the patch server, so I soloed (a 51 necro wanted a
partner, but he wanted to go to BW and I didn't feel like it). I spent
an hour and a half pulling things to the south wall of KC and either
nuking them or dotting them, depending on mana, clarity, and whether
or not it had 8 legs. Someone in wolf form came up to me, watched me
for a minute or two as I parked my mobs and killed them and
complimented me on my 'kiting' - I'd *never* have thought someone
would stand around to admire my solo tactics :)
I wasn't getting any spectacular lag spikes or packet loss and never
noticed a thing until someone shouted that half the zone was link
dead. A minute later there were 20 people in the zone. I wasn't lagged
but was getting worried about a potential server crash - especially
when someone claimed the servers had been locked - so I grabbed the
first blue spider I saw, snared, fire debuffed, hit it with 3 shots of
starfire and dinged to level 50 :) I headed to bank, and MT and
Rivervale were empty. Camped, logged in my alts to transfer some stuff
in EC, and there were 22 people in the zone. It was an eerie feeling
to not have a chat buffer full of auction green. Did a /who all count,
and there were 499 people on the server at 11 pm EST. Count was up to
600 by the time I was done transferring, so at least people were
starting to get back in... 

I guess I'm most annoyed because this patch meant the Nagafen raid I
had scheduled for tomorrow got canceled; I doubt I'll get a second
chance to see him. Oh well.
