 Well.. There's usually a reason nobody responds to those types of
questions. Dozens, if not hundreds, of other guilds fought those same
mobs and were able to come up with tactics on their own.  Anyone else
should be able to as well. Including you. Or I guess stake out
Safehouse.

 Another free hint: His stun is directional based so you could avoid it
if if there were no pillars if you pay attention to what's happening. I
think that's one of the reasons they made PoP like they did where the
walls, for all practical purposes, don't exist. At least as far as
spells go.
