Ya know, I've had that quest done except for the urn from Drusilla for a
year or more.  Including all the faction work.  So...  how was it you
crashed the zone exactly?

About that.

Tend to be impossible to get single unless you have a feign puller or
pacification.

Yeah, and semi-fast (and high strength so they hit on the high end of that
often).

Not MR at all.  Only MR-type issue is that you need to use a certain
enchanter mez if you want to use enchanter to CC.

Eh.  Who knows.  It's not that uncommon, but it's not terribly common
either.  Expect to make a day of it, but you might get lucky and get it in
half an hour.

> 6) need 57 enchanter to mez

Ahh, you knew about the enchanter thingy then.  :)

Hits for under 200s, stays on the higher range of hits often, hits fairly
fast.  They have some pretty hefty damage output, but I can solo one so it
can't be all *that* bad.  I'd guess about 15 to 20k hitpoints.

There are lots of fairly safe spots to rest and med (or pee).  If you are
very cautious about it, you can probably handle it with that duo (though I'm
basing that off rangers I've known, so the state of your equipment might
influence that).

With you not being familiar with the layout and all, I'd definitely suggest
adding an enchanter and a cleric for your first try until you see how it
goes.  You may realize you don't need them for next time.

Getting down to them is the hardest part.  The shrooms can be a pain.  If
you're not there for exp or loot and simply for the sinew, you can probably
avoid the majority of them.  I'd guarantee you'll have to fight one or two
though.  For reference, I 2-box down there sometimes and I got into a
particularly nasty situation where 2 cleric mobs wandered into range of the
cleric shroom I was fighting.  I killed that thing 14 times before I saw an
exp message.

Most important of all, though it only takes one fight in Sebilis to figure
this out, every mob must be snared.  :)
