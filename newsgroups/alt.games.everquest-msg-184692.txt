When clearing PoF to do Cazic, I use agro on CT to pull the various mobs
out - useful when the last few mobs are scattered around the zone or I feel
too lazy to run into the temple.

The entire zone most definately does agro (exceptions being paladin epic
mob, the broken golem - shissar does assist)

PoG has more examples of this (mini bosses being called by their minions, as
well as Tunare calling almost the lot), and Kael as a mini version (tormax
will call to arms his 2 wingmen).  The classic old example is Vulak - if you
didn't clear nToV first, he'd call all the lords and ladies to assist him
