    The best way to do that is to strengthen the organizations that are 
already in the game - guilds. Guilds go out and recruit unguilded folks, 
unguilded folks decide to start a guild to get the benefits - this 
encourages people to come together in community. This IS encouraging 
interaction, and it's not solo-unfriendly. Imagine if, as a way of 
encouraging interaction, they ensured that no mobs in DoN were soloable. How 
much whining would we hear then? That is the alternative - instead of giving 
perks to those who group, punish those who do not.
