I hope you don't have to maintain two versions to do that.  If you do, you
might want to look into a system that lets you write with XML markup which
can be converted to different output formats.  DocBook, for example.

Maybe just XML with two style sheets--one for generating the HTML FAQ and
one for the Usenet FAQ--would be good enough.
