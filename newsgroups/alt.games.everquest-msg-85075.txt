My reaction to your story is to wonder why on earth you're trying to
powerlevel people in Crushbone, of all places.  CB is full of people
still learning the hard fact of EQ life that the mob you want is not
always the mob you get.  And quarreling endlessly about it.

Why wouldn't you take them to the Karanas, for example, where nobody
gives a damn if you kill another gorge hound?  Emperor Crush is
considered valuable by the levels who frequent CB (although I'm damned
if I can remember what, if anything, he drops) and to see a level 45
dr00d pulling him out of the tower no doubt angered them in turn.

To avoid disputes, stay away from disputatious places :)
