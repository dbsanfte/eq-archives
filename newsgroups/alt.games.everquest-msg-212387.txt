Not entirely.  You can examine your faith, and you may find that it is 
misplaced, and thereby lose said faith.  You may also not find any reason 
to believe it is misplaced, and retain your faith.  This does not mean 
that you can prove that it is right, just that you have found no good 
reason to believe it is wrong.  There are many out there with blind faith 
who will overlook all the flaws in their faith, and hold to it 
regardless, but that is not true of all people who have faith in various 
things.
