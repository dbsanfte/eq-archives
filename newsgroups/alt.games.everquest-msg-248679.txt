No, I was pretty rude, so I deserved it. :) While I do think it would be a
better world if the people who hotly debate such matters (particularly
those who make such claims as "The game will suck because _____ is a bad
idea") were informed as to the true colors of that game...it doesn't
excuse me from acting like a spastic brat.

Not to mention I have NOTHING against folks having discussions about
theory.

My excuse for brat-dome is that I had just corrected yet another
new-to-EQ2-person on their misconception that clerics are no longer the
only pure healers. Dear gods but that is such a hard concept for EQ-L
players to accept!  I even had one woman say "Yes, I know the devs SAY
that druids, shaman and clerics are all now equal in their healing
abilities, but I just have a FEELING that clerics will be better healers
regardless." 

Lady, unless you are an oracle at delphi (or however you spell that), I
don't give a ratonga's butt-hair what "feelings" you have about game
mechanics...if the devs say it works this way, then it works this way!
