Hehe, i used it a little in NFP to port people.
Dont see the change as a big problem, since its just 70 mana to gate 
back. True, you have to zone 2 times, but half the time you translocated 
people you went to safe spot and went in "no cast, no sit, no camp, no 
nothing" mode, untill you zones, so had to zone to WFP and back anyway.
