She stands upon
Southhampton Dock
with her handkerchief
and her summer frock
clings to her wet body in the rain.

Easily the best song on the album. The Final Cut itself is a damn fine song 
also. I always felt like Not Now John was kind of the odd man out on that 
album.

I *heart* the Final Cut. I remember seeing Floyd on their 95 tour (Junior 
year in high school :) in Phoenix and how sad I was that they ignored one 
of their finest albums.
