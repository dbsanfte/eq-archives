   It _was_ fun.  Fun enough that I put off a
corpse run, something I very rarely do.  But 
I don't think that it could ever be the main
way of doing things.  Of about 6 or so people
on the dock, I was the only one that responded
in character to the opening question.  Most of
the others ignored him, except for the who came
back with "?" and "WTF?".  And it took about an
hour of the other person's time, albeit a fairly
nice chunk of that was hanging around while I 
found "his" items.  I have no idea how long he
spent looking for a participant before he 
found me.
   Maybe people on a Legends would be more in
tune to this sort of thing, but I wouldn't bet
the mortgage payment on it.

           though, especially if the fix the
           "no reward" part of it.
