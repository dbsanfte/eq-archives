I believe he described his procedure for writing the juveniles as something
like "write the best novel you can, and cut the sex".  The only other nod
toward non-adults is that the protagonists in them are usually late
teens/young adults.

As far as the non-juvenile stories go...I don't recall any smut in "The
Menace from Earth".  The lead character was a female who was smart,
extremely competent, and aware of the different roles for men and women in
our society and willing to work within the system, which is a type of female
character that draws the ire of many critics as being unrealistic or a
fantasy--but I believe I've read the Heinlein's wife was such a woman, and I
met several such women when I was a student at Caltech.  They are not
unrealistic--just very rare (dammit!).
