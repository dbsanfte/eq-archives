When my druid has to kill animals, he doesn't lay the sword to them. Fire
and other spells only.  And if you say I'm hunting for the items rather than
sport, then using fire to kill them is better than the blade or club. You
wouldn't want your leather bashed or chopped up, or meat smashed and
shredded beyond use.  Fire would just burn the hair/fur off the leather, and
make the meat cooked.  If I'm hunting animals for food I'd rather have the
looted meat come pre-cooked.
I do wish there was a tailoring recipe for the following...
1)  Snake skin belt
2)  Alligator shoes, gloves, tunics and other items. (made from ruined, LQ,
MQ, and HQ alligator or crocodile skins, like cat, bear, and wolf pelts).
3)  Lizard man skin armor
4)  Lizard man tail belt or whip (made from tail).
5)  Maybe a set or pieces of armor made from zombie skin and bone chips
(would probably be quest armor and Necro only).
