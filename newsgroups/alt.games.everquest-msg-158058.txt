The main problem is, when everyone sees the proc, they picture it in a true
melee's hands. "If I had that hammer, I'd solo Innoruuk!" or whatever
exaggeration they may have. They don't seem to picture it in a Clerics's
hands.

Clerics have a 1HB cap of 175, Dodge cap of 75, Defense cap of 200, and a
Bash cap of 165. (Once again, perhaps Lance Berg can correct any mistakes I
may have made.)

As you can see, Clerics lack Double Attack, Riposte, Parry, while having a
very low Dodge cap. Clerics also lack true plate mitigation, which is a
benefit that Paladins have over Clerics. The average Cleric has to kill very
quickly in order to prevent being beaten down too badly. Now sure, there are
Clerics with Vex Thal gear that can be pretty good tanks, however in all
fairness they're very well equipped - so they deserve to be better.

If you look at the logs Erik Larsson posted, you'll see that he dealt an
average of 22.78 DPS over the course of 4 fights. However, looking at the
logs, I also have to point out that he does not appear to be tanking, so
that on it's own makes an unfair comparison. If Larsson were tanking, he
would be getting stunned a lot more, and he'd have to stop and try to
channel a heal - hence causing a considerable loss in damage.

Larsson, it's also evident that you were grouped during your logs. If you
would like a better example, you should solo something you can kill with
moderate difficulty using your own buffs - no outside assistance and no
undead mobs.
