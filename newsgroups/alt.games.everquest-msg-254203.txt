If you're DOTted and close to dead, an extra 3 regen/tick can be
a life saver!  And as others have noted, it reduces downtime a
little bit.  But you're right, it was mostly swamped by the more
recent "sitting regen" patch.

My monk was somewhere in his late 20s when he found out about it.
I was in a pickup duo with another monk, and I saw the animation
for it, and asked what he was doing.  After we finished I headed
straight for the tome vendor!  (This was before the regen patch.)

One way of looking at it is, assume you don't have to stop to
heal up more than once per 5 minutes, and that when you do you
always rest for at least 1 minute (or close to it, since you
often spent another few ticks finding the next mob).  Then it
heals you for 30 each time you stop to rest.  That means you
get to stand up sooner; how much sooner depends on how much you
were healing per tick at the END of your healing period.  If
you were, say, a Human Monk below level 50 prior to the regen
patch, you'd be regenning 2-3/tick (assuming no regen items or
buffs), so this would have saved you 10-15 ticks of sitting.
After the patch, though, you're probably getting 10-20/tick by
the time you stand up, so you only save 2-3 ticks at most.

So yeah, it's pretty small now, but every little bit still helps.

Hm, not sure I've ever tried to Feign after activating the
discipline.  (Or if I did, I was too busy watching whatever
it was that made me Feign. :-)  But I know if you try to
activate the discipline while Feigned, it works but breaks
the Feign, which is even more of a pain in the butt!
