I just thought of an idea...possibly lame ,its late and I'm tiered,so the
chances are high.
Ok the idea is a group of 4 or five tutors would charge gp or pp for
training some one in the art of mid to high level grouping.The group
consisting of all the basic class types (tank,healer,mezzer,and nuker) .So
if a healer type wanted training the healer tutor would step out of the
group and give "tell" lessons in the ear of the healer apprentice.Like....
use this spell now so it will do this ...,don't forget to do this and
ect.This all happening while the group is actually fighting a high level
mob.If the student is failing the group the teacher would intervene....Uhhh
the more I write about it the dumber it seems....what do you think?
