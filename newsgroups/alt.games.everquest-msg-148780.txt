>>>To my surprise, everyone went right by me, even though by now gnolls
pretty much hate me.  The caster must have escaped, b/c a minute later all
the guardsmen come back, again go right by me, and back through the
door...<<<


The first time I hunted in here was with my level 8 ranger a few months ago
and I had a similar experience. Everything on the first floor and around the
bridges were in the light blue to even range and for the most part I was
able to wander around the zone without attracting agro, paricularly around
the scrawny and patrolling gnoll spawns.

Later on, around level 12-15, I was able to dance with the gnoll guardsmen
all night long, and not get smacked for it, even with the lowest possible
faction for the gnolls of blackburrow. Like I said, this was my first time
leveling up a character in this dungeon, so I had no prior experience about
what was to be expected, although I had heard stories about legendary trains
of awsome magnetude.

Not sure if it was by luck or design, but at the time, I didn't really care.
I was too damn busy running around like a chicken with its head cut off
looking for components for my newbie armor. =)  (damn giant field rats.....)
