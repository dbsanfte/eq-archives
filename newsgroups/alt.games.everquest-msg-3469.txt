Yeah, though lately it seems as though the darkies have the upper hand.
Oasis of Marr is in a constant battle for possession. Humans will mostly
kill shorties on sight. <sigh> Which seems stupid to me because the darkies
are growing big in numbers. Dark elves seem to be real popular.

I played Rallon Zek for about 2 hours. I played a dwarf that got slaughtered
every 2 minutes by a another newbie dwarf. Real hard to survive. I found a
sort of "sanctuary" with PvP Teams. Things aren't over camped. EC is not
full of auction spam, actually I rarely see anyone in the tunnels. It also
adds
a lot more "realism" to the game. People tend to like to have everything
handed
out to them, like the easiness of traveling from point A to point B. I like
the
challenge and the fear of knowing that someone can take you out deep in the
forest.
