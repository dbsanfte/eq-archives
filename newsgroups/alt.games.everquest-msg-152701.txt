> Tiggy: the magic kitty

That's funny. We also have one that we call "The Magic Cat".  The cat's
original name was Sassy, but is now called Fat Cat. Runt of the litter,
apparently, and VERY undernourished after being abandoned, she was so
small that we were afraid to have her spayed at the normal time, waiting
instead for her to "grow up a bit". Literally too small to definitely
survive surgery. But after more than a year of unlimited food available,
she got no larger. you could hold her in one hand easily.

Well, we broke down and got her spayed (the meowing during heat was
unbearable) and as many cats do, she lost all hyperactivity tendencies
and started EATING. She got no taller, nor any longer, but balooned up
until she looked like a football balanced on four slightly longer than
normal toothpicks. :-(

The reason she is the "Magic Cat" is that, while sitting or lying on the
sofa or loveseat, you can be talking, watching TV, listening to music,
reading, etc. and suddenly realize that there's a cat asleep on your
lap. No clue when or how she arrived there. And this cat now weighs more
than a stack of t-bone steaks. But she just seems to magically appear in
your lap, already sound asleep.

By the way, after reading your post, Frog, I'll say that you are one
hell of a good human being.
