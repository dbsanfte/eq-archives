I see it in every tradeskill I do where I can do a lot of combines in a 
row, along with other things that can skill-up, such as combat skills and 
swimming.  I did swimming yesterday with my idiot Dwarf and he would 
consistenly get 3-4 skill-ups in 30 seconds, followed by 1-4 minutes of 
nada.

I will sit there and fletch for a minute and not get a skill-up, and then 
get 3 out of 4, then none for the next 10-15, then 3 in a row, etc.  
Happens all the time - way too often to be purely random.  This particular 
phenomenon happens to all tradeskillers I have talked to about it, I'm 
surprised you haven't noticed it.

Pottery is a joke to raise.  I was surprised any time I -didn't- get a 
skill-up when I was doing it.  It's calmed down now that I'm on vials, but  
I swear a retarded troll could master it in no time.

Fletching is where I notice the piss-poor RNG the most because I have 
fletched with most of my characters, even the ones who can't use bows.  
Fletching doesn't go up every combine like Pottery did, but isn't insanely 
hard to get a skill-up in at the lower levels, so there were enough times 
between skill-ups to see the obvious highs and lows in the skill-ups.

I'm only around 85 in Tailoring, and get pretty decent amounts of skill-
ups, but the problem is the number of combines it would take in a row to 
get a feel for the ups and downs of the RNG.  I will only do a few attempts 
now and then when I have the stuff.  I have about 3 backpacks full of 
swatches between all my characters at the moment because I gank every 
spider I see.  When I start Wu's, I'm hoping to have enough to get though 
those pieces pretty quickly.

My Jewelcraft is still pretty low ( if I got back to it, I will be working 
with early Gold ), and I saw decent skill-ups, but I know that will change.  
My Guild-bud who has mastered everything has about a 205 in Jewelry now, so 
I get to hear his success rates on Jewelry and the other trades.  I fear 
some of them at the higher levels.

Yes, I mentioned that was what most people would like to see, but, we don't 
see a lot of that going on ( in tailoring for example ) except for 10-
slotters, maybe Wu's, and the insane high-level tailored items.  I was 
shooting for items with lower trivials that a trade-skiller can be happy 
about making, but Verant won't think is too much of a money-maker and 
"unbalance" the game.  A nice LORE NO-DROP item will unbalance the game a 
lot less than one you can make over and over and sell.  As much as I want 
to make a ton of cash from tradeskilling, it doesn't seem to be in 
TheVision, unless you have invested tons of plat into it, and insane 
amounts of time in the cases like Tailoring.
