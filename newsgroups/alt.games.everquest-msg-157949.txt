I saw a few comments on eqnecro.... but generally the comments and thoughts
are more aligned with , "Good, no one will pester me".

As it is, I understand that the spell Summon Corpse does not work on corpses
above level 60 any way. Not sure if Conjure Corpse does or not. Or if
there's a higher one than that.

The nerf the necros complain about is "Twitch plz" instead of depending on
mages for rods. Our mana and time is better spent on DOTs and DDs  during a
fight than twitching a cleric or wizzie. I don't mind twitching the chanter
during break in (though I'd prefer to see more chanters), or twitching
buffers as we get ready- just not during the fight.
