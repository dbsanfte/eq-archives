Quite a shock isn't it?  I'm still getting over it myself.  I found out that
51-52 takes twice the amount of exp as 50-51 because when I died at 51 I
only took a 5% hit.  The amount you lose when you die is 10% of the
experience it took you to level in the previous level.  It sucks, but it's
that much more satisfying when you finally hear that ding.  Especially if
it's at 3:00AM and it means you can go to bed now.
