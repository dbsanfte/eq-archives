I have 2 bazaar mules.
I have 3 toons with 250 tradeskills and 1 at 242. Tailoring--( I just want 2
more skill ups )

I make and sell many PoTC quest items. Most items with most tradeskillers is
sold at the same price.
Everyone makes a few pp and can keep on skilling up.

Every now and then someone starts undercutting. Sometimes by just 1 gold
piece.
So my 2 mules start a price war with each other and eventually the
undercutter jumps in.

As one mule continues warring with the undercutter I log off one mule and
log on an inventory mule.
The mule buys out everything once the price is either near my cost or below
merchant sell back price.

Some days I make more plat doing this than in sales..
Definately more fun too.
