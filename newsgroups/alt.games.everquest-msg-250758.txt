Hmm, I have to say "that don't make no sense" to this, to which you'll 
naturally respond "its a fool that looks for logic in the corporate 
heart".

Revenue is revenue.  Declining revenue isn't so good, but flat revenue 
for the forseeable future?

While it makes sense for a gambler in the stock market to value a 
business based on the likelyhood of it becoming More valuable in the 
future, it seems to me that that is an approach doomed to failure in the 
long run, as it must inevitably lead to every business being overvalued. 
  I don't think I'm explaining what I mean very well, but essentially it 
means the entire stock market is really a gigantic Ponzi scheme.

If I'm right, don't tell anyone.

The trend of people percieving SOE as going downhill, rather than the

So if I were an analyst working on your theory, I'd be thinking "hmm, 
SOE's new stuff sucks.  EQ is the only thing that's working for them."

Yep, that makes sense too, if making money isn't the important thing, 
just looking like maybe you can win big on this Next venture.  Tinkering 
around with EQ isn't going to hit big no matter what you do, so you need 
something new... and since they've dropped the ball on all the other 
MMOG's they've tried so far (including the seemingly guarantee'd hit 
SWG), the only thing left  to try and swing for the fences on is EQ2.

This part makes sense to me, although I think its thinking based on the 
old school, non prescription markets.

Seems to me that the sales of boxes aren't really where the money is in 
this industry.  Boxes cost money to produce, and worse, have that nasty 
"money sitting on a shelf" thing going on.  LOY, which was available 
cheaper as a download (it was LOY wasn't it?) was the first thing I've 
seen them put out that burst part of that model; if you can sell design 
work without having to pay for packaging, split profits with the 
distribution chain, and worry about how many units to make in advance, 
boxes make more money.

But for the boxless box to work, you need an installed player base, as 
you really aren't going to see a lot of new customers from that.

This strikes me as very much in favor of your explaination for things: 
as the boxless box doesn't bring in new customers, its no more than a 
bump in the revenue stream.  If its not about milking EQ for all the 
money you can (which seems to me the sensible model, since there's been 
a lot more milk from me for this game than for any other in all my 
gaming life, even exceeding MTG and D&D/AD&D), but rather looking like 
at any moment you might dramatically increase your value, then this sort 
of posturing makes a great deal more sense.

I'm dissapointed, but then thats why magicians never reveal their 
tricks; its always a disspointment to see how its really done.
