Yes, we can "kill" them all.  It's worked in the past, and it will
continue to work.

That's fine if you post to a rec.games.chess.* group.  If you try to
post to dozens of groups that have nothing to do with chess, Jews, or
methods of fixing games, then it's just spam.  Have you looked at the
list of groups "Hal" posted to?  Most are groups that have nothing to do
with anything in his post, and are groups that he does not participate
in.  Pure spam.
