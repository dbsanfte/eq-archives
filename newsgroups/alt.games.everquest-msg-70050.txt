First of all, please don't think I take you to be an idiot, because as a
computer support representative I come across the 'simple' errors all the
time.  You have downloaded the latest EQW?  You have installed it in to the
same folder as Everquest.exe?  And you are running EQW.exe not Everquest.exe
to get into the game?

It is still surprising how many people forget to check the powerpoint you
know :-).
