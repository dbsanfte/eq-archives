I loved my Amiga.

I agree, there is more than reliability to consider.  The fact that when I
used MACs, I found that I preferred using the PC running Win95.  And I
preferred my Amiga at home to both of them.  Perhaps the MACs have changed
enough such that I would reconsider, having access to a command line is a
step in the right direction certainly.  :)
