*shrug* Same reason they get forage? They're travellers. They can live
a little off the land, but they're not *that* good at it.

That's my best shot.

Actually, I agree with what someone else said. Everyone oughta be able
to learn forage and tracking to some degree. "Adventurers" should
learn to make at least some use of the land, since they tend to spend
so much time out in the wild. Just that the "specialist"
hunters/nature priests are much better at it than anyone else.
