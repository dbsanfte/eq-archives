(I promise I do more than just bitch and whine.  I swear!)

So, my character name is Jennifer.  (Not really, it's an example.)  I have
had this character since October 23, 1999  and have almost 58 played days on
her.  She's not got a big rep, but her rep is good enough.  I'm part of a
very small guild with a very good rep that we take seriously.

I also want to note I can take a joke.

Tonight in PoK, I /ooc'd and someone named Jenyfer said, "You stole my
name!"  I thought it was amusing--y'know, joking around--and when they said
they'd duel me for it, I targeted, typed /duel.  (5 levels apart)  They
didn't accept, didn't expect it.

But then a moment later, they shouted that I was a name thief.

I still figured it was just good natured sparring over similar names.  Then
I got the first few tells.

Jenyfer: how long yu been playing that char?
Me:  Since october '99
Jenyfer:  bah yu stole my name
Me:  LOL....when did you start?  There's also a Jennyfer and a Jennyfyr too,
I think.

I hear nothing back from her right away, but a moment later I got a couple
of tells from people in other parts of Norrath.  A few quick /who's showed
they were in Jenyfer's guild.

"name thief lol"
"why does Jenyfer think you're a theif?"

I *still* figured it was an ongoing joke thing, that she'd told her guild
about the similar names and joked about the name thief thing.

Until they kept coming.

"ur a thief"

And so on. I'd get about a half-dozen t's about my name, only one didn't
accuse me of being a thief (it was blank).  Then I found out that she hadn't
told the whole story--just that I was a theif and that everyone should tell
me as much.

A moment later, I heard from Jenyfer again.

Jenyfer: "can u change yer name"

...

No.  I'm not changing my name for you.  I've had it 4+ years, I'm kind of
attached to it.  I was still assuming it was all a joke, but not so sure.
It was getting less funny anyway.

But then she logged and one of her guildmates told me they had a new MOTD:
"Send Jennifer a tell once a day telling her she's a thief."

Okay, joke's over.

Make a joke at my expense, I'll laugh.  Get your guild in on it, I'll laugh.
But just announce to them that I'm a thief and not even tell them why?  And
ask them to send me daily reminders of my alleged thiefdom?  Or have
guildmates ask me to change my name?  I don't think so.

God bless there was another guild officer online who changed it a few
minutes later on their own.

I can't believe someone got that worked up over THAT.  I am very proud of
myself for being level headed and non-flamey though. :D
