newshound007@freedom.net (newshound007) (if that IS his real name)

>I can't ever forget how much i hate that asshole Whitecure. Just yesterday, 
>he tried to pick a fight with me. He called my mother a slut, and then I 
>called him a fag. (I'm very clever, aren't I?) But then his friends 
>Lightcrusher and Bluemender joined in and started making fun of me. I 
>thought they were my friends, it really hurt my feelings.

>Also, in my opinion, EverQuest is getting way too easy. All the fucking
