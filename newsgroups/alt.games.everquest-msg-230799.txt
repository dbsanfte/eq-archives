Based on past experience, I'll likely regret this, but...

Do what makes you happy.  A lot depends on what you do with your playtime, 
but, generally, levels>AA.  Run speed is very nice for getting away from 
mobs when you need to, so, worth considering getting RS2 or so earlier, 
but, otherwise, level to 65 first, then 100% AA once you have a decent 
buffer.  AAs come very fast at level 65 compared to trying to get them at 
lower levels.
