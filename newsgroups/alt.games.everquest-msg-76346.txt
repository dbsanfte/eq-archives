She only spawns at night.  The best way to get her is to have track and look
for her in front of Guk.  A couple years ago, I looked for her with my mage and
killed everything I could find out there.  With my  guise of the deciever she
would do the ruby for item trade and I got the earring twice ( two seperate
times of course) in three rubies. After that I spent a lot more rubies and
never got the earring. Now with my druid, when I rarely pass through to guk I
can just check and see if she is up.  Good luck.
