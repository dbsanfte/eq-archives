Disagree. I enjoyed Sword very much, and am a huge fan of LOTR (as a
measure of my LOTR geekiness, be advised that I can read Tengwar).

Rip off? Sure, I suppose, in that any reluctant-hero-on-a-quest story
will be a rip off. But if you're labeling it on that basis, no doubt
stories in the same vein that predate LOTR can be found. There is
nothing new under the sun.

And again I'll disagree. The books following the first, while all fun
light reads, are generally based completely on the formula in the
first. But why not - the formula worked, run with it.
