They get a similar attitude when they double-pull.  I don't know *why* 
so many people do it, I'm not that high level and I've died quite enough 
due to having a secondary person decide the puller isn't doing his job 
fast enough.  But a lot of the time I or someone else has the nerve to 
say "can we please stick to one puller?" we'll get a sulky groupmate 
muttering about how we're not going fast enough.  Yeah, that's fine, 
only maybe the tank's a bit lower level than is good for multi pulls 
when we've got no healer, or maybe we're waiting on the healer to 
recover her mana before pulling that giant when I'm the only tank in 
sight.  Casters are particularly bad for this, I've noticed.  Tanks may 
pull when the healer is OOM but they learn fast when they die.  Casters 
otoh seem to think that because they're not getting hit (or because 
they, themselves, are full mana), the whole group is invulnerable.  And 
the common excuse for going off and pulling their own is "it's okay, 
I've got C3".  Then the moment the shit hits the fan you get "help 
me!!!" from someone getting hit by one mob while you're rooted and 
trying to fend off three.
