I was reading about the new Nurga and the freed slaves quest in there and
about how once a slave is freed, he repops in another zone and will never
respawn in Nurga again.  Curious if anyone knows who these slaves are and
where they start reappearing?  I did see two new NPC's in the tunnel in
Freeport leading to the PoK book and the sewers that talked about one going
through a lot of trauma, etc.  Curious if these are two of the slaves.

Not really looking for anything useful here, just my constant craving for
information.  Now speak up Number 6
