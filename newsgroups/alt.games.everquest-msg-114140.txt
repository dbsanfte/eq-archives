I, for one, am ecstatic whenever I hear about some new ubermob that it
takes the biggest guilds months to get to and kill. I hope that Vex
Thal is full of them and full of uberloot that makes primal pale by
comparison.

I say this in spite of the fact that my guild will probably not see
these zones or MObs any time in the forseeable future. Last night, we
took down Dozekar the Cursed for the first time and it taxed our
resources mightily. What I like about the existence of these massive
uber encounters is that they keep the bigger guilds out of our hair.
They're off doing MObs we're not even vaguely interested in, not
pulling shit to the zone line in ToV, making it impossible for us to
get to the Halls of Testing or taking down ubermobs to outfit alts.

Uberguilds are often difficult to deal with, but *bored* uberguilds
are infinitely worse.
