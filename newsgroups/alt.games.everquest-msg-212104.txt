As I understand it, it increases numerically.  It is a percentage of the 
amount of xp required to gain your current level.  This is why, when you 
are level 60, you lose close to one yellow of xp, as levelling from 59 to 
60 takes a huge amount of xp, and leveling from 60 to 61 takes a fairly 
small amount of xp.  The amount of xp you lose when you die in level 61 
is very small, due to how little xp is required to go from 60 to 61.
