Is this the same 13 year old with the "disposable income"?

In that case you need IT lessons... sign up for them at the same time as
Parenting lessons.

They are... Social Services will be making the call any day now.

Well this child obviously does... about computers at least, or so this
message claims.

Not posted here... but unsupervised minors being allowed to roam the
internet at will IS a threat to their lives... in a very real sense.

I think you'll find that any EULA constitutes a legal document, regardless
of wether or not it's for a game.

Really? I actually found that to be quite flattering.

HER computer??? You mean this child STILL has independant access to the

Okay... now I'll scare the "poop" out of you, sir...

There are people in this world whose attitude is "old enough to bleed, old

protect your child from people like that by monitoring her internet access.
