The bazaar limit are 500 traders. Happens often on Veeshan now. To be 
able to trade, just keep hitting begin trade till you get a spot when 
someone log/leave trader/go LD.
Or you could see if there some chanter around that you dont like, and 
try to get them to cast Sentinel, should clear up some space :)
