I did Eve for a while, starting in early beta and playing for a while
after release ("late beta"). I'm a big Elite fan, but the game failed
for me due to having very little content. They've been adding a bit
of PVE content gradually, but from a friend who stills play occasionally,
once you have a battleship (or a titan) there's not much to do unless
you want to PVP.
