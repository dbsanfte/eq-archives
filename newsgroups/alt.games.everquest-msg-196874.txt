I've hunted there many times and there are plenty to go around for two
soloing players.  Your offer to share the camp was generous and he was being
an ass.  I would have continued to hunt in the area and if he kept bothering
me I would have petitioned.

Contacting his guild leader is not such a bad move either. They may be a
prominant guild, but do they really want to be represented by someone like
this?  Most guilds work hard to keep their reputations clean and would not
want a bully like this to spoil their good name.  Keep a log so you can back
up what you say either to his guild leader or a GM.
