It's not really that bad. Monks are the only class in EQ that aren't
tied to equipment. A naked monk is 80-85% as effective as a fully
armored one (with the exception of resists).

A monk can fight (grouped) into his 40s with a full set of cured silk
and his fists. 

Being poor is part of being a monk (or at least it used to be) It
seems like every new monk I see today is completely twinked out. I am
not complaining. I am just pointing out the fact that playing a "true
monk" hasn't changed. You can still get by with the gear you can hunt
for or buy with the limited amount of looting and coin collection the
weight penalty allows.

I'm not knocking twinks. I am just pointing out that you don't need
access to large sums of PP to play the class and be effective. Monks
are very well balanced and extremely fun to play on any budget.
