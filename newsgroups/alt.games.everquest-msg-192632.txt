I am still fairly new to this game having played for just over 1 month
now. I have started grouping in PC over the past week or so with my
now 23d level Druid.

I have been told that the Druid in the group is a;most always viewed
as only a healer. My friend told me that in some groups (I think he
meant with more seasoned players) They might even get angry if the
Druid actually did any attacking instead of keeping everybody healed.

That's how I have played it. My sole task is the keep the party as
healthy as I can and I take it personally if one of the party gets
killed. I feel like I have let them down.

Now for my questions:

So far I have been left on the short end of the stick loot wise. I
hand back concentrating on the health bard of the players and use the
brief pauses between combats to heal and meditate. The tanks doing the
fighting are always on bent knee right after the fight taking first
shot at the loot. This leaves me the leftovers after combat and
healing have been done.  Is this how most groups are run?? Is it going
to be my Druid's lot in life to miss out on any of the good loot
because of my support role?

Shoud I say something to the rest of the group about it??

Another question I had is When youa re a member of a party is the cash
you get from a corpse always split automatically with the rest of the
group?
