It is 53K max in USA and without compression, that is just a little under
7Kbyte.  It is possible the higher connection rate is dropping too many
packet with EQ but I can play just fine with UO and Phantasy Star Online on
this PC at 56K.  Maybe EQ doesn't resend lost packet or something?  Either
way its very touchy with poor connection.
