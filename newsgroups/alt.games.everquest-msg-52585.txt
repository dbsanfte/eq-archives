   So this was a highly advanced tactic, not a boneheaded 
move made on a whim when I was drunk!  I feel better about
it, now.  It was risky, exhilarating, and well, risky.  And
pretty wasteful.  My mage is very mildly twinked; she still
has to watch her malachite budget.
   Thank you for the advice about the water pet.  If I knew 
what I was doing, I probably would have gone that way.
So water is better than earth?  What about fire and air?
