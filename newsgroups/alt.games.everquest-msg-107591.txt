Like the others have said the Hybrid XP penalty and there was also a mana
restriction also that reduced the amount available to hybrids were both removed
about a year ago. On a side note My Beastlord has never had a problem out
damaging my pet unless I chose to let him do all the work. Sounds like you need
to work on those melee, defense and casting skills some or it will be a long
road. My Vah Shir Beastlord is level 40 and only played 16 days. However half
that time was spent getting his brewing to 135 and his tailoring to 141. He also
has messed around with the Sonic Bane claw quest and getting a few rallic packs
also so total time leveling I am guessing is around 7 or 8 days.
