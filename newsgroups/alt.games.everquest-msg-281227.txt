And you feel, for some reason, that if tradeskills were profitable, there
would be less incentive to create macros for it?  I won't say you're wrong.

I'll say you're 100% unquestionably wrong.

Now if you would like to start a different (that is the key word) topic on
the subject of macroing and how to combat it, feel free.  But macroing would
be used with the current implementation whether it was profitable or a money
sink but required.

Give enough time and skill, a bot can be made that plays any game in
existence, in its totality and as good as an average player.  That's a silly
argument.
