Make sure you are using /say and have the NPC targeted.

Depends on your operating system.  My WinXP gives me fits swapping; my
Win98 machine just requires I have the application open or hit the
Windows key.

Several cites have merchants that sel them. Halas (chick hiding behind
one of the taverns), Kaladim (in the mine by the bank), etc.  Check
www.eqtraders.com for vendor locations.

You usually only get one shot, (pulling) before you have to melee.
You can shoot when they start to run.  You could also offer to shoot
arrows at mobs another group is fighting for your skill ups and most
groups will let you; it's unlikely you will KS the group and they will
like the extra damage done.  A DEX buff helps too.

If you were moving and stop to cast the server often does not see you
stop right away.  Stop and make a slight turn to the left or right
before you begin casting.  You can turn while casting.
