Update. After the patch (as of last night) the blacksmithing trivials
for banded had not changed. Gauntlets trivialed for me at 168 and cloaks
at 175.  I don't know if I have it in me to go further or not. Need to
look at both ornate chain and plate and see what each requires. I think
my tailoring is high enough that I can make myself a skinning knife,
take my delux sewing kit, and head on out to the warrens and make as
many paddings as possible. Or whatever the required bits for ornate
chain are.

Hrmm... I'm tempted to just stop here, but that 200 smithing skill
entiices me. Of course, I'm also running out of money quickly so that
may be a factor.
