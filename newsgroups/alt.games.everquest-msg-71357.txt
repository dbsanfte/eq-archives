Doubtful. Something that changes the scenery would require too drastic
a change, and there are limited "static" houses already in the game.

I think that would be going overboard personally.

>-Allow religion change?

Possible, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

>-Allow Alt-Tabbing out of the program?

Hope not...Why? Hackers.

>-Increase in the number of spell gems beyond 8?

Definately hope not. It would be too drastic a change to the strategy
of the game.

>-Recovery of thrown weapons and arrows?

Nice, but might be a pita to code. Arrows would be unrealistic to
recover, unless it's a slim chance. They don't tend to hold up well to
actual hunting/combat use.

>-A use for languages?

There already is. Perish the thought of RPing in a role-playing
game...

>-Better pathfinding for mobs?

Heh

>-Automap?

Don't hold your breath.
