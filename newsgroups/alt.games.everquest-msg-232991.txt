You sure you are in the right spot...took me about 6 spawns before he
popped.  From the OT zone facing towards BW, you want to take a hard right
and follow the zoneline...are you high-sunning to find out which mob belongs
to the pop spot?  We killed a lot of mobs in the general area to pass the
time but the only think i could see happening is you are at the wrong spot
or if you aren't doing it straight its popping after you leave and you have
to start the cycle over again.
