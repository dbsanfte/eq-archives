Look, each character has positives and negatives, and which character is 
best for you to play depends on your individual play style. Start 
playing a character that seems easy to start, like a dwarf warrior or a 
halfling druid. Explore the game for a while, and get some of the basic 
mechanics down, and then try something harder if you want to.

I think I've had at least one character of each class and race. My 
favorites are the dark elf necro (not an easy beginner class) and the 
dwarf cleric (fairly good for beginners). Lately, I've been playing a 
gnome mage, erudite mage (harder than the gnome), and troll beastlord.

Don't worry about which is the best stat wise, and just try what tickles 
your fancy. I enjoyed my human druid more than the wood elf or halfling. 
Play what makes YOU happy.
