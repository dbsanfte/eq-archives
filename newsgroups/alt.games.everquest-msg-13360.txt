Wonderful, Dan! Always glad to hear your opinion. Now, on to the meat of
it. Why?

Ah. Quoting Verants exploit policy. So in other words, you can't come up
with a way to justify it to make sense outside of saying, "Those are the
rules Verant imposed, so that's that."
  Mind you.... I have no problem with that. I play the game, and if I
wish to continue playing, I will abide by the rules. I also like to
understand them, though, where possible and enjoy hearing others'
thoughts on their origins or rationale, if any.

Sorry.... apples and oarnges. The instance you cite is clearly true, but
I don't see how it applies to the "laws" imposed by Verant in our
virtual world.

In the instance I cited, I died repeatedly. (My root sucked on those
Minos) and I eventually gave up and left. Not from guilt, but from lack
of xp gain or loot.
