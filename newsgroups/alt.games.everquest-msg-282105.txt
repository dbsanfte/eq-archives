But by using DirectX, they are tied to what MicroSoft is willing to
support. Thus, if their developers license requires they use the latest
and greatest DirectX available, once the latest DX no longer supports
the older version of windows, neither will the software. I believe DX9c
or whatever dropped W98 support (though with some fancy hacking, it
should still be usable, as it works with ME)
Their hands are likely contractually tied.
