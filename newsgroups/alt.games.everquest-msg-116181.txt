Well, what I am saying is perfectly consistent with bards, because bards have no
special attacks (like kick) to be active when ID triggers.  So they pass that particular
test every time.

To reiterate, my understanding is that all special attack buttons must be up at the time
ID kicks in, and it must also pass the kick test.  Bards don't have special attacks, so
their null set of special attack buttons are "up".  I don't know if the kick skill affects
whether or not kick connects in ID, that's just what I've read from a couple of places.
I have no particular reason to believe it other than the fact that it sounds logical.  Of
course logic never stood in the way of Verant (for example, scorpions carrying
money).

Ciao.
