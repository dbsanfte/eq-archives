And it goes too deep, too.

For example, I need Iron Sheets to make Maple Strongboxes.  Fair
enough, but the person making the Iron Sheets needs Eolith Temper to
make the sheets, so he, in turn, needs a scholar.

Hence my 2 alts.  With my main I now have 1 of the three Crafting
types.  Annoying, but necessary if you want to be able to craft at
your own speed, and don't want to be hanging around for a week to get
a component, or spend a fortune to buy them from the broker.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
