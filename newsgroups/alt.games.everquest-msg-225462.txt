OK - I got a couple of things wrong in my post to Bob, but I'll
try not to do that this time :)

Planes come in tiers.

Tier 1 = Nightmare, Innovation, Disease and Justice.

To get into tier 1 planes you just need to be level 46.

Tier 2 = Valor, Storms and Crypt of Decay (I always thought
CoD was 3, but it's 2).

There are 2 ways to get into these planes now -

1.  Be level 55
2.  get flagged for them.

To get flagged for PoV/PoS you complete a trial in PoJ.

Trials are 6 person events - the nature of them varies, but
they were tough for all but endgame players at the release of
PoP.  They have gotten much easier as people leveled to 65
and got their pop spells and gear.

There are 2 ways to flag for CoD - one is a quest that I don't
know the details of.  The second is killing Grummus in PoD -
It took us a 40 person raid, average level 64 to take him.  Our
Guild Leader was with Sigil early in PoP and they wiped to him
with 60+ people.

Tier 3 = Halls of Honor, Bastion of Thunder, Tactics and Torment(?)

Torment I'm not absolutely positive of.

You can get into HoH and BoT by merely getting to 62.  You can
also get into HoH, BoT, and Tactics by quests.  The HoH and Tactics
quests flag whole groups and can be done by single groups.  The
BoT flag requires drops off named giants in PoS - we used to 2 group
them with difficulty, now we can 2 group them easily.  Everyone 
needs to get that flag on their own.

Tactics and HoH also have raid flags - Tactics you need to kill
Manaetic Behemoth in PoI factory (for which you need to trigger
and kill Xanamech to get flagged for the factory).  HoH you need to
kill Aerin Dar in PoV - Crystalline dragon.  We beat him Tues with
50 peopel, avg level 64.

Torment I'm not so sure about - I think you can get that flag by
being in a Terris Thule fight, for which you need to get flagged
for Plane of Nightmare B (by doing the hedge maze trial in PoN -
the limit for this is 18 people at a time).

The next step is the Tower of Fennin Ro (I believe)  I'm not clear
on how to flag for that - except that it requires completing trials
in HoH B.  We're at least a couple of months from trying to flag
for there.

After that is Tier 4 - the elementals.  

Finally is Tier 5 - Time.
