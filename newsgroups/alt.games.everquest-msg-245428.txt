Beggers.  Hate 'em.

My level 7 rogue, a kitty dressed in a few bits of banded fresh from the 
Bazaar*, popped up at the Soulbinder after getting ganged-upon by gnolls in 
time to be accosted by a level 1 gnome warrior asking if I would mind helping 
out "a little fellow".

Granted, he had very good English, but he didn't seem to like my advice 
(which was to hunt, loot, and sell in North Qeynos)** because he walked off 
and kept /shouting to the rest of the PoK for someone to help him with armor 
and weapons.

Sigh.

* Banded mail armor, currently selling for 1 plat per AC on MR, which is, as 
I understand it, the proper going price for the stuff.  So why the heck was 
someone on Firiona Vie selling the chest piece for /50/?!  Bleah.

** I've yet to find a newbie area as easily lucrative as North Qeynos.  Not 
only plague rat tails and cracked staffs, but rat skulls and eyes, snake 
poison glands, king snake jawbones, and skeleton tibias all sell for 2 gold 
/each/.  Afterwards, Blackburrow is even richer -- any gnoll part that's 
stackable (apart from "a patch of gnoll fur") also sells for 2 gold each.  
Woo hoo!
