Yea, whining always seems to win out.  Money I guess.....

God I long for the days of the EQ of old when 30 people got gang raped
at the entrance to Black Burrow because of a train from the deep.
When you had to find an uber necro to summon your corpse out of the
Hole.  When dying had consequences so you figured out tactics and
strategies to avoid it if possible, recover quickly if not.

Even in Vanguard, which was supposed to be the next gen hardcore gamer
game, it's retarded easy.  No real consequences for death, easy-kill
mobs if you have even half a clue, but still a metric assload of tards
who worry about single pulling mobs.  Jeebus, I'm getting old and
cranky.

Luckily the House O' Booze has ready made groups every week so we can
tear it up as we wish.  But pickup groups are tough sometimes....

I digressed, the dps ratio's won't happen for the reason you said.
Sad.
