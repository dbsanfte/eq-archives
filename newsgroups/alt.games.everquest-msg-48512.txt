Have to agree here. The DL groups are often very efficient and in off time
you almost always have something to talk about. No idiots training your
camp, no beggars, no extreme auctioning and always a helping hand when you
need one (clear entrance to KC or help get a corpse from the middle of the
battlefield and such).

Good zone, great people :)
