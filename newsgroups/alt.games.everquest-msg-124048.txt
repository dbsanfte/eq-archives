I agree.  Rogues are a disappointment.  My dark elf rogue has some useful 
skills.  Hide and sneak come in very handy, I admit.  Ultravision is 
another plus.  But what USE is a rogue?  First of all (and I think I've 
already ranted on this one elsewhere) rogues - despite the name - can't 
solo well.  Think about that.  'Rogue' means one alone, someone who does 
their own thing, goes where they please, and generally doesn't follow the 
herd.  But in EQ, a rogue has to group.  Where's the sense in that?

Secondly, you're right.  Pick locks is of no use since there are very few 
if any locked doors.  Pick pockets is of no use as far as I can see 
although I may reconsider that if I ever get better at it.  Disarm traps...  
Well, WHAT traps?  The only traps I've met so far are simple concealed 
holes in the floor such as those that drop you into the Qeynos sewers - and 
send traps doesn't sense them.

As for melee skills - WHAT melee skills?  At level 11 I'm doing an average 
of 10 points damage per hit because in order to get my extra "backstab from 
the front" attack I have to use a piercing weapon.  And I can't find a 
single one of those with a damage more than 5.  My alt warrior hits better 
than that at level 6.

I like rogues.  It's just a shame that Verant are 'indifferent' to them.
