Also be aware of a problem that can occur if you use text logging.  I
noticed that after my log file got above a few meg, I would start to get
brief pauses as my harddrive was accessed to write to the log file.   Turn
off logging and the problem would go away.  Renaming the log file to
something else (or deleting it) helped for awhile until the new log file
grew in size like the last.  As you get higher in levels, it seems that more
is written to the file as you do faster damage or are in a raid situation
which compounds the problem.  I am not sure if this would happen if you had
one of the newer 7200 rpm harddrives selling now.
