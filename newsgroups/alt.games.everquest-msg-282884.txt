So far so good.

Why not?  Did you feel like you might have done something wrong (and you
haven't told us the full story)?  I can understand not wanting to get into a
flamewar on /shout or /ooc (or even /tell), but a simple "huh?  it was /ooc'd
as rotting" seems only polite, and you may learn that you missed a retraction
or something.

It's not a common nor old enough phrase to have a formal definition in most
dictionaries.  Its meaning is defined by people who use it.  That said, what
you describe (looting something that's been offered as rot) doesn't qualify
for my definition, nor the one at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Looting.
