Your router uses NAT (network address translation), so a different IP
address for the computers behind it is unneeded.

You are using the same address for all of the computers behind your router
for the Internet. However, as I mentioned before, you are using NAT. Your
router knows which packet goes to each computer and with route it
accordingly. The system at the distant end doesn't care. It will send the
packets to the correct IP address even if you do have several systems
sharing the same one.

For instance, both me and my wife play Everquest. We use NAT and have the
same external IP Address. We both connect to the same server, the only
difference is the account.

We have no problems whatsoever, even when playing at the same time. We do
the same thing with Unreal Tournament, Need for Speed, and Quake III Arena.
