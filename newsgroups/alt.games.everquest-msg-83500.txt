As has been discussed before, obscurity does not change whether it's allowed
or not when it comes to trademarked or copyrighted names.  They are
explicitly not allowed in game, and if someone were to use the name Lokari
in game, which she does not, then if it were petitioned, it should be
changed.  I can't say that a GM would or would not change the name, but
under the rules Verant presents, they should.  I would also mention that
just because it is obscure to us here in the US, does not mean that it is
obscure elsewhere in the world.
