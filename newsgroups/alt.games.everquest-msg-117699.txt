Aha, you're paying attention.  You are correct that levels get tougher
as you get closer to 60, except for 60.  Level 60 takes only about 60%
as much exp as level 59, and is roughly equivilant to level 56 in
terms of raw exp cost.
So one level 59 is basically 3 AA levels, which gives you a feeling
for how fricking annoying 59 is.
