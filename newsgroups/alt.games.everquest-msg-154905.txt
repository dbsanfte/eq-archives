I think Verant's idea is that guilds are supposed to be like the one I'm in
(Scions of Veeshan, The Nameless).  Here's the description of us, from our
charter:

    The Scions of Veeshan have evolved slowly but surely over the last two
    years of their existence. This guild was created at the very beginning
    of the Nameless's life and has survived many a crisis of growth,
    leadership and evolution. We think that in the main, we have now
    achieved a balance between "rights and obligations" that will keep us
    going foward for a long, long time. We are an association of players who
    share many essential core values: honesty and fairness, a certain level
    of maturity, a strong sense of humour, an irreverent respect for one
    another, a refusal to disadvantage casual players. But first and
    foremost, we have a relaxed, playful attitude. Don't misunderstand--we
    are a sleeping giant, but when we roll over, things die.

    Our main purpose in playing Everquest is the enjoyment of the journey
    itself, the pure pleasure of social gaming. We aren't competing against
    the designers of the game to see how quickly we can "beat" their latest
    creations. We're not driven to raid every locale, complete every quest,
    kill every mob, loot every item there is. There's nothing wrong in
    making our characters as powerful as they can be, of course. But the
    process of doing so should never become "work" lest we lose sight of the
    fact that we're really supposed to be playing here. If you're not having
    fun, you're not playing anymore. We believe there's no "endgame" to
    Everquest, no ultimate goal to be achieved at all costs. Raiding is fun
    simply because it brings many of us together to accomplish things that
    we couldn't do alone. Killing the last mob and looting it are are great,
    but ultimately not really the reward of the raid. We're happy tourists
    that will look in wonder and amazement at the world around us, while
    wiping the blood of the locals off our swords and plundering their goods
    to our profit.

Here's the first rule in our rules section of the charter:

    The Scions recruit players, not characters. Therefore, everyone is
    welcome to apply, without regard to their main character's class. 

(This is at www.scionsofveeshan.com, if anyone wants to read the whole
thing).

What will the Mage nerf mean to our Mages?  Well, they will be less useful
on raids.  But they can still come.  The only circumstances I've ever seen
us tell someone they could not come on a raid are:

1. They are too low level for the zone.  You don't come to Halls of Testing
at 50, because the AoE spells will eat you up.  Or, their level is high
enough, but they are missing resists or equipment that is needed.

2. They didn't show up on time.  (We often stretch this point...although now
that we are doing more raids in areas where the is competition for camps, we
are being more strict about this).

3. So many want to come that lag will be a problem.  We've done this once or
twice on General raids for Rogues, where there are generally several Rogues
from different guilds, all bringing their guilds, for an evening of multiple
general killings.

4. When, for some reason, the person running the raid only wants a specific
number of groups.  Someone might be told then that the raid is full.
However, they would be told that whether they are a Mage or a Cleric or a
Warrior.  If they were a Cleric, and the raid leader decided having another
Cleric would be worth while, he'd up the number of groups, and that Mage or
Warrior could then come, too.

Note that none of those were "your class is useless".
