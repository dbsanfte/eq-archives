Actually that's exactly what I was trying to point out. You bet you
SBC/Yahoo keep logs of what IP is assigned to what customer when. If
you have an exact time and an IP, they will be able to tell exactly
who was using it.

Of course, SOE won't easily have access to that data, so in a sense
that makes you somewhat safer (if you remember to release/renew your
IP every time you switch between the accounts).

But I still firmly believe they can ID you. I don't know this, but if
I was the programmer writing the login code for SOE, part of what I'd
silently transmit to login would be an ID that uniquely identifies
your computer (processor ID, mac address, windows product id, class id
of your control panel, EQ cd key codes... anything that's very
unlikley to change). But who knows. I still doubt they'd actually
follow this trail unless you do something monumentally bad, at which
point they'd just supoena your identify from SBC/Yahoo anyway.
