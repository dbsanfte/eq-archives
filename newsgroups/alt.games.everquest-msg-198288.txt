At some levels, it is definitely true that getting AA can get harder after 
you level.  Going from 60 to 61 was not one of those.  I can still solo the 
same mobs for AAXP I did at level 60.  I can still group in the same places  
for xp as well.  I know that will change soon, but, I did manage to get 
flagged for PoS/PoV where the mobs I fight now are white to yellow to me 
which means dark blue to 65.
