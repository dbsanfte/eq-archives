Success.

Went in to the Tox with ranger, started killing mobs, which went down 
very easily.  Restricted track to red mobs only, about 6 on track. 
After killing about 20 mobs the Reeking Skunk popped.  I tracked him 
down and watched him for a bit, then logged out and got my Berzerker. 
No friends online, only 5 guildmates, all busy somewhere far from POK.

Went to Tox, looked around for quite a while, finally found the skunk 
far from where I'd left him, followed him for a bit but concluded I 
might as well give him a shot.  Pulled with throwing axe and he followed 
me to the POK book, where I engaged in melee.  Got him down to 60% but 
was at 35%, so I zoned out.

Well now one guildmate was dead and waiting rez, so I managed to get a 
haste off him, and another who'd been AFK popped up long enough to give 
me a DS; he was busy feeding the baby but saw my plea on the screen and 
took time to hit me with the buff.

Back I went, wandered around for a bit (glad DS now lasts 15 minutes, 
would definately have lost it) and finally found skunk again. Engaged, 
and this time things went much more smoothly, I finished him off with 
37% of my hp bar left.  I suspect I could have taken him without the 
buffs by running and throwing axes, as long as my SOW held out... he 
didn't run particularly fast.

However, to my annoyance he Was immune to stun, and to snare.  This sort 
of thing bugs me, its a berserker epic mob, and yet the only special 
powers a berserker has are useless on him; IMO he should be -more- 
vulnerable to them, heck, it should almost -require- a berzerker to kill 
him!  If he'd been stunnable I would have been able to kill him without 
the buffs easily... or snare would have made running away to recover and 
throw axes a stronger possibility.

I was dissapointed that he didn't proc anything; regular skunks give you 
a neg cha buff that lasts quite a while, he should have given me a ng 
200 cha buff that lasts 20 hours, then I'd feel like I'd been up against 
an epic skunk!  As it stands the only thing skunky about him was his 
general appearance.

He also didn't run at end of fight, some mobs do, some don't; it would 
have been annoying if he had since he wasn't snareable, but as it 
stands, don't worry about that.

Looked it up, the next two mobs spawn in EJ and in Stonebrunt.  So much 
for my sub 20 ranger plan.  The EJ one won't be bad, some of those mobs 
should still be blue to me, if I find a level 40+ tracker partner we can 
go as an exp duo while we try to spawn the Disease Ridden Gorilla.

The Stonebrunt one, though, is a pain, too high for my one day wonder, 
too low for anyone who can group with me and get exp.  Maybe there's 
someone in the guild I who has a tracker alt I can PL, although Berzerk 
doesn't seem like a very good PL class... probably I can just stand 
there and let the mobs try and beat me down thru my standing regen while 
PLee kills them; a little DS wouldn't hurt either.
