Bloodpoint?  Why bother till he's 50?  (I'm generally anti-twinking so I'm
biting my tongue).
Look for a decent weapon (ie. bloodstained fang).  It's great to do high
damage, but it's not much good if the tank you're opposite can't keep the
agro on him.  If you outdamage him ever few seconds even while he's
taunting, you'll be taking way too many hits.  Keep it reasonable.

You're doing fine here.  Keep the Neth weapon over the BSFang mainhand.
Flashy backstabs don't make you a good rogue.  Backstabs are only a portion
of our damage, don't neglect pure DPS over looking fancy.

I'd disagree.
Fast is useless if it's not doing much damage.  You've got to look at the
bigger picture.  3/17 is not preferred over 5/20 or 8/24.  Until you're 20+
damage bonus kicks in, don't worry too much about speed over damage.  Just
get decetn weapons in general.  Later, your offhand will NOT need to be high
damage, but GOOD RATIO.  Again,  8/20 = 16/40 offhand.
