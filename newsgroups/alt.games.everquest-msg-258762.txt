I've seen it less, recently.  A couple years ago, it was fairly commonly 
used to describe Dark Elves, frequently in an insulting tone.

Say what you like.  I may be range-slot equippable, but hardly

In general, I have no problem with language evolving.  "Phat" and 
"Bling-bling", for example, after a little minor resistance, have 
eventually found their way into my vocabulary and made themselves comfy.  
Despite the fact they're umm... not very Norrathian.

I'd be very interested to see your poll substantiating that "most people" 
assertion.  And further proof that they, assuming they 'quite rightly' 
favor your particular choice, are in fact 'quite right' to do so.

The fact they -bother- to try and come up with a different spelling 
suggests to me that they do 'quite rightly' attach some sort of importance 
to it, and are at least -trying- to be inoffensive, and on that count, 
bravo.  But why they couldn't use one of the other scads of words meaning 
'bad' listed in any reputable thesaurus, and thus completely avoid the 
chance of offense, is beyond me.  'Pisspoor' and 'execrable' look like 
particularly fun choices, in my eyes.  Or 'fusty'!  Now that's a lovely 
word.

Or if all else fails, you could always just say it's bad.
