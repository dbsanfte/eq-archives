Yes removing the staff will help.  You will get two checks
of HtH instead of one.  
As for a level 4 monk getting to qeynos to up faction? 
Teleport, Some druid or wizard ported him to NK, then
escorted him safely to Qeynos for a bind, and start the
faction game.  Thousands of Gnolls later....  He won't be
able to bank for ages, but usually not a problem as a
newbie, esp if it's a secondary character.

Forage will take care of food and drink for him, so he
doesn't need merchant faction.  It's relatively simple to
avoid the KOS npc in a newbie area.  1-4 North Qeynos, 5-7
Qeynos Hills, 8-15 or so Blackburrow.  By then he should
have killed enough gnolls that he is no longer KOS, and can
actually start turning in some of those fangs he collected
over the ages.
