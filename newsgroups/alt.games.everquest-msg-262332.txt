Agree entirely, and they both do deserve some credit for the improvement of
the economy during their second terms.  To continue that comparison, though,
the economy didn't tumble after Reagan like it did after Clinton.

I'm quick to blame the recent tumble on a whole lot of speculation (i.e.,
the "dot com" boom and bust) and shady accounting (see Worldcom, Enron,
etc.).  But to do that just takes credit away from Clinton for being
president during the "boom".  As well, some of the "boom" and "bust" of
Reagan's term and after could easily be pinned on the S&L screwups.

This is the rhetoric I've never understood why people buy into.  If I'm a
multi-millionaire, do you really think I care about how rich other
multi-millionaires are?  The only way to justify that rhetoric is by saying
that he wants business owners to be successful.  In which case, I'd say
that's a pretty damn good idea if you want the rest of us poor suckers
employed.

I've seen the division explained as "tax and spend vs. borrow and spend" and
I have to say I'd rather the government "borrow and spend".  Of course, I'd
prefer the government to simply shut down a good 90% of their programs, but
we all know that isn't going to happen.
