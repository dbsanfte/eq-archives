I find life mostly tedious with occassional happiness.  In all
honesty I'd prefer to never have existed.  I wish I was one of
those people who seemed to blindly enjoy the drudgery of day-to-
day existance.  Or at least not mind it.

That being said, I don't find life bad enough to end it.  At this
point, I may as well wait and see how things turn out!
