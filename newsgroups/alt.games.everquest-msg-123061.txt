Alchemy is level capped.  Specifically, (Level-24)*5 is the cap.

For all tradeskills, you will not get the skill at a level above 1 when you
put one point into it.  It does not matter what level you start at, each
point you train in the tradeskill gives you one point in the tradeskill.
So, at level 60, if you decide to take up tailoring, and put one point in
it, your skill level will be one.  This does include Alchemy.  You cannot
train any tradeskill above 21 with the trainer, at that point he will tell
you to go out and practice your skill or somesuch.
