I think a compass doesn't have to be in main inventory any more.  I
hadn't used my compass in months, but the other day I dusted it off and
I'm sure it worked out of a pack.  If the compass is in main inventory
though you can make a button for it so you can use it when not in
inventory mode.  Just right click and hold the button.  

Most people train a few points in sense heading skill and work it up so
they can tell what direction they're going.  But a compass is great for
starting out or for if sense heading fails twice in a row and you get
frustrated.  

To tell what a normal item does right click on it and hold the button
down and you'll see the stats.  If an item doesn't give any stats it's
only good for selling.
