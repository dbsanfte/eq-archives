Whats your opinion on them?

Personally I think they suck the salty ones big time and gameplay wise is 
very "consolish". If I wanted to special moves and twitch reflex games I 
would have gotten an Xbox or Playstation.

As a matter of fact I dislike it so much (and it will be such an integral 
part of grouping) that I will not be renewing my subscription. WoW is coming 
out, I may give that a burl instead.

PS - there is no EQ2 in the subject line on purpose, the Sandy Vagina 
Brigade can lick my taint if they can't fugure out Heroic Opportunities is 
EQ2 related.
