I haven't gotten to the real hard hitters, but I have been on Vox and Naggy
raids, and it is absolutely true.  You cannot hit even the unnamed fire and
ice giants within those dragon's lairs from a good distance.  Of course, the
same is true of the dragons.  I don't know if it has to be exactly melee
range for a player character, but yes, you have to be close enough to hit,
that if by hitting you piss the bastard off enough, he can swat you without
taking a step.  I had thought that maybe the distance did some funny math
with resists, but even Lure of Ice (the only true Lure I have at 52) will
never hit beyond that range.

That said, there is at least one quickiness that applies only to those
dragons . . . the booting of players with agro who are 53 and up.  Maybe the
melee range rule was created only for Naggy and Vox and their escorts.  I
couldn't say on that score.  I did tag the king of Kael (forgot name) once
when he was pulled to WL zone, but the battle spam went so fast, I have no
idea if it hit or not.  I got faction, so I was happy.
