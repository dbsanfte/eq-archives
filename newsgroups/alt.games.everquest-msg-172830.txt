I went and purchased the $50 gold pack; thinking I spend $50 on most
PC games anyway.  I Played the game with an open mind for the free
month almost.  I had developed a wizard (12lvl),  a rogue (lvl8),  a
necromancer (lvl5), and a druid (lvl4).  outside of a few differences
the play is the same  for all of the classes.  The thing I am saying
is that the play didn't feel that much different for either class.
The main thing is that the graphics are so out of date for a first
person didn't help me continue to play it.  I love a indepth game more
than graphics EQ isn't close to that type of game play.  The main
thing is it is a multi on-line game, well for what it's worth the more
players in a certain area the worst the lagg and LD were.  I went to
the bazarr and coudn't even move very well let alone try to do
business.  Everytime the game hiccup from lag the player would be
heading in a differnet direction, making trying to get to places
difficult.  Granted I didn't really build up my characters to 51+ but
at this rate who would want to...  The constant leveling is the only
thing that is interesting but not enough to pay a monthly fee for.  I
have morrowind and it is more indepth, better graphics, game play, and
social interaction then this game and it is single player.  If I'm
going to pay to play, the game should at least be level with nonpaying
games, or one better beat them.  I really was looking for more game
play then I was used to.  This is not it,  I feel I got my $50 out of
it but just, to contiune to play is just bending over and asking for
it.  Everone has an opinion and this just happens to be mine.  In the
future I will be checking the progess of EQ2.  If they improve the
enviroment, net coding, graphics, and game questing maybe I will pay
for it.  I can chat with all kinds of people on ICQ nad not pay a
dime.... 


Just my point of view without getting so far into it I try to recover
my losses like some loser gambler.
