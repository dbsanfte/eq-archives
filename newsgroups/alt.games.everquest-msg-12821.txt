For those of us pitifully low level types that will never get near the Sleeper's
Tomb for months to come, can somebody expand on this storyline and also what
happened in this specific incident? I hear tons of rumors about the sleeper, (e.g.
if he's "awakened" then he comes out and HT's the entire zone or server and kills
everyone, etc.) but have no clue about the truth of it.  Something about some
guardians around him, and you're not supposed to kill the last one? EQAtlas seems
to have no information on this zone.
