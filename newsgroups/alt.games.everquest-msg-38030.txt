Hmm for some very big reason, such as Verant saying time 
and time again that there never will be horses (fairly recently even)
I really doubt the validity of either that post or the article in that
magazine.

The biggest part that does not ring true is the increase the movement
speed of all mobs part to be as fast as the horse. That makes no sense
if you think about it and is a pretty good hoax clue. I mean, why do
that? Just make the horse not quite as fast. Just does not ring true
at all.
