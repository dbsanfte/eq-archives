Remove rangers and shamans as well, that way there'll be no porters
and no classes capable of casting sow. Then your warrior can run
slowly across norrath attacking things with a huge 2handed weapon -
and if you get encumbered, look up an enchanter for a 10 point str
buff. Now, doesn't that sound fun?
