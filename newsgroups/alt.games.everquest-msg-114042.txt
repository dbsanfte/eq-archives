It is too possible to make a game not sensetive to LD's and lag, but i can
tell you it won't be an action game :)
Wordks fine for things like chess, GO, reversi and so on, but for an action
oriented game like an MMORPG
it is impossible. Verant is probably doing whatever they can to minimize
problems on their end, but they don't own nor control
the internet, there are far too many factors that play in to whether you are
connected to the gameserver or not.
And there are far too many exploit issues with instant removal from the
gameworld when you loose connection on your end.
I know i would be ever so tempted to "pull the plug" in a situation where i
am baout to die in an unfortunate place to save my hide.
