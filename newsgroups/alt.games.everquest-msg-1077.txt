So basically My 58 ranger will Loose exp with the patch?
Lets say I had 58,000 exp, Will my exp now drop to 50,000?  They are
going to strip the exp penalties, but they are also going to have a
mark of how much exp is needed for Ranger at lvl 58  to be 58.
Instead of adding what I already have they will be taking this away to
equal what my exp bar already shows, hense i'm loosing alot of exp.
Why does this upset me?  Well when I die I will loose a bigger chunk
of exp than I did before, but this don't take into account the extra
1000 or so mobs they errased.  Does any of this make sense?  I just
forsee problems with this next patch big time.  Either people will
loose lvls or gain.  I just can't see it going through smoothly.
Expect not to even get online after the patch IMHO.
