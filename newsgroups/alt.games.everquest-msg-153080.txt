I play a level 34 bard, and my friend plays a level 35 druid.
We are looking for some tactics/hunting suggestions.
I dont want to be just a mana-battery for the druid, and my hp/ac are waaay
to low for me to act as a tank.
I was thinking I could charm-kite while the druid sticks a dot on the mob we
want to kill.
Or we could both just dot-kite the mob, but my dots/dds are pretty lame at
level 34.

Any suggestions?
