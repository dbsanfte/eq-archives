Asking opinions is one thing, and a perfectly acceptable one at that.
Lamely and decptively attempting to generate interest about your own
(pathetic looking) site, under the guise of asking for opinions is another
matter entirely.
If you didn't post under the name "Bytes", and didn't use the same email
address to post as the domain is registered to, perhaps no one would have
said anything.  However, this thinly veiled attempt at free marketing has
likely had quite the opposite effect from what you intended.  Rather than
seeing the site and subscribing (though I doubt anyone with any common sense
would anyway), people will read this thread, realize that you assumed that
we were all monumentally stupid (in that we might not notice the ruse),
relish in this astonishing display of ineptitude, and merely laugh off the
whole matter...

Today's lesson:  Don't be dumb.
