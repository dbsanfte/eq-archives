I agree.
	On Wednesday I went in and some idiot is using 
Shout with all CAPS... we should kill the m'fers, they all should
die...
then someone else was shouting back at them...
I attempted to handle this with an OOC requesting it to be moved to
OOC if not tell.... no response,  I then took it to SHOUT incase they
had OOC off... both disregarded the message.
Then I took it to personal tell to each..  (who the hell am I, well I
was just tired of hearing about it)  One obliged and went to OOC..
the other turned it into a personal assault, telling me I was happy to
see the people die and I was a sorry fuck...
Needless to say this pissed me off right out!!!
Then he goes to say He is in the military and I could not have any
comprehension of what went on and what he has see.
(Ive done my military time I spent time in Shield and Storm)
well, I continue to tell the individual that He was incorrect and
please desist the converstion because it was quite upsetting already
without him throwing false accusations...

Some people are quite the dimwit fucks... and very hatefull too.
makes me very sad.

in the end he asked me to stop talking about it....(wasnt that what I
had asked of him in the first place?)  I pointed out that that is all
I wanted and bid him a better day than he had started..


Hunt well all
