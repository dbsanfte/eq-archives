I figure there are bunches of people reading this NG, I may as well give it
a shot. . .

I've been looking for a missing friend for upwards of a year.  He's about 6'
tall, blondish, green/bluegrey eyes.  He was working as a piercer in the
Austin, Texas area about two years ago and kind of vanished.  He answered to
"Goose" or "Gustav," but the name on his driver's license is "Eric Gustav
Johnson."

If you  happen to know him (or someone you might think is him), let me know
by removing the spam traps in my reply address.
