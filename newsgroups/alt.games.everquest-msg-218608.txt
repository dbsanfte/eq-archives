don't know about the keyboard, but recently I had to rebuild my
machine.  I did not do a reinstall of EQ, so nothing has changed
there.  But now on the new system load with the exact same drivers and
version of direct X, anytime I open a new window. i.e. inventory,
containers, or even when I cast a spell (when the spell casting bar
pops up), I get a two second lag/freeze of graphics.  Sound doesn't
skip, just video frame rate.

I have no idea what is causing it.  I have read my UI error log, and
the only errors showing are the common ones of missing standard files
and will look in default dir for the file.  

any ideas would be appreciated.
