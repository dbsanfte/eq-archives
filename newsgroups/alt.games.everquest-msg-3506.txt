Just type /friend <character name> and that will remove them. This
brings up a question that I have, though. Why not have the friends list
be server independent? I play on a couple different servers, and I have
no desire to look up any of my friends' names from server A, while I am
on server B. Anyone heard of any reasons for this? Just curious. Thanks.
