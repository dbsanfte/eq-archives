I have to say, that "Scheduled Downtime" thing annoys me.

In the world I come from, you schedule things weeks in advance.  You let
people know well beforehand when a server is coming down and work with them
on issues that may arise.  It's a laborious but necessary step when you talk
about any server downtime.

When I see Sony say, "In four hours Drinal will be coming down for scheduled
maintenance" with no prior warning, I have to shake my head.  If they did
that in the "real" world, they'd be handed their walking papers.
"Scheduled" does not mean you slap something on a web page a few hours
before it actually happens.  That's freakin' *un*scheduled in the eyes of
most of the business world.

To step off my soapbox, though, most individual server maintenance is indeed
scheduled weeks in advance.
