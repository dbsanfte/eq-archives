Yes, lots of people are upset about the lack of useful information on 
EQPlayers.  However, they post their concerns on the Sony site, where 
Sony will see them.  That's marginally more constructive than moaning 
every single time Sony patches in a forum that Sony doesn't read.

There are three reasons I can see for moaning in here,

1. in the hope of warning other people
2. in the hope of getting it fixed
3. just to vent because it frustrates you

Well, #1 we all know it's broken, #2 no one who can fix it reads this 
forum and #3 can be also resolved by checking somewhere that *does* get 
updated.

So that leaves me with

#4 Likes to moan and wants to just cry about something for the hell of it.
