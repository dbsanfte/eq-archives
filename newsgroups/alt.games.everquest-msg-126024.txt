 I didn't agree with it all but overall it seemed fine with a little
tweaking. Most of your changes are what I would have made. However, each
guild would probably rank things a little differently based upon the
encounters they've done. For example, we can kill Shei with no deaths
(other than the DT) but Burrower still eludes us. I'm guessing it has to
do to the fact we're light on casters usually. Due to the small hit-box
on Burrower I'd say casters probably do more damage than melee. Either
that or we suck which is always possible. 

 Arch Lich just kicks our ass.  We need to work on strategy more on him.
Rampage seems to be our downfall as we end up with a lot of dead
clerics.

 Sont is just a zerg fest. I hate that encounter. We'll not a total zerg
if you can find 12 mana-burn wizards that aren't doing anything that
day.
