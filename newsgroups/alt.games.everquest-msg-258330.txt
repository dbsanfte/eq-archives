There's two different things here.  One is the movie line, with two+ 
people in it.  Yea, that's fine, and doesn't put you ahead of anyone, 
because the person(s) in the loser lines step out, as you only need one 
transaction.  The other is the merging deal where, say, you're on the 
freeway heading toward the exit that 80% of everyone on the entire freeway 
wants... say, at the interchange with another major freeway, or the exit 
for the ballpark.  Most of the people get in line behind the 1/4 mile of 
cars who wait their turn to use the one-lane exit.  But then there's 
the jackasses who think the line's too long, and dodge back onto the 
freeway to scootch up the line and join the queue at the last possible 
moment.  -That- is putting yourself ahead of others, and is just rude.

It's even more fun when they decide to use the shoulder.  Sorry pal, maybe 
the guy behind me will let you in.  Of course, someone invariably -does- 
let them in, reinforcing for them that this is a peachy-keen idea, despite 
the fact it ends up making the polite people wait twice as long, and 
involves lots of dangerous bobbing in and out, trying to merge.  And 
driving on the -shoulder-! /rude.

I wouldn't say it's comparable to the movie-line example at all.
