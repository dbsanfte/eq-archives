Do you get AA points faster at 60 than 52?

I've heard two opinions on this.

One says: an AA point is the amount of exp from 50-51 and since  (to use
their numbers although they may have been purely an example) levelling at 60
takes 300 points and 50-51 as the baseline takes only 100, you can gain AA
points thrice as fast at 60 than at 52.

The other side says: AA is like regular exp. As long as you hunt mobs that
give the same amount of exp relative to your level, you'll get AA points
just as fast no matter what level you are (ignoring hell levels.)

Which is true?
