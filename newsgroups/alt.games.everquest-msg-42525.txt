Most people have answered some of your questions.  I'll offer my two
coppers for the questions they haven't answered. 
 
At 20 you can do the langseax quest easily with a shaman so you'll
have SoW to keep up with Frostbite.  You may get a Langseax of the
Wolves, a nice 2hander at your level.  A langseax sells for about 20pp
on most servers, if I recall correctly.  They are fairly easy to get
on Xegony server.  Silvery axe, a lore item from the king's room in
Perma, has the same damage but one less delay.  You may get it cheap
after a Vox raid if you know a higher level going in there or aution
for one; it will cost more than the langseax.

Permafrost entrance has a warp point near the entrance.  I tried as a
solo warrior to fight at the entrance & could not get exp there.  The
mob starts to run and you chase it.  When it reaches the first turn
(where 2 other goblins are waiting), it warps to the top of a ladder.
There's usually a higher level healer mob by the ladder.  Needless to
say, the two by the warp point jump on you, the healed one comes back
with the healer and you're lucky to zone.  If you don't chase, you can
try using a bow to shoot the runner who will stop just before the warp
point, but bring LOTS of arrows.  To fight there, you really need a
partner to snare or root the goblin before it warps away.  EXP is good
though and a group can do well.  Deeper in there's an archeologist
that drops a weight reduction bag & rarely a +STR mask.  Also not too
far in one mob drops the Cold Iron Morningstar, an nice 1hb magical
weapon and rarely the Runed Circlet (AC4 +4 WIS +4 INT).  Usual drops
include rawhide & ringmail armor & rarely some bronze; the weapon
drops are usually rusty or fine steel with a few rare bronze pieces.
Permafrsot crystals drop commonly, stack, and sell for almost nothing
to merchants, but a smith once paid me 1 pp per crystal for a stack of
20.
