To Jakugg more or less

Seriously though, Sounds like you are doing the right thing.  I have also
started to limit my EQ times.  Other than a few "must ding" sessions, I have
been only playing about 2 hours a night, down from 4 or 5.  I have actually
started reading again.   I enjoy the social aspect of EQ the most and
sometimes log on, chat for a short while with my friends list, and log off.

I consider EQ almost a hobby.  I have many hobbies and have found that over
the last 10 years of so, I bounce from hobby to hobby about every 4 months
or so.   EQ has at least been the cheapest one so far :-) and I have noticed
the $ difference.   I am sticking around in EQ to see luclin and then I
might drop out on a more permanant basis.  My long term interest lean
towards Star Wars Galaxies but who knows what will happen in that time.

Winter is coming in my world and I expect that will keep me playing SOME
form of mmorpg.

I like the idea of a dedicated EQ night or two a week.  Something that you
and your friends can schedule in advance.  That way, you waste less time LFG
and utilize the game time the best.    I know, being able to log on and
start fighting with Jakugg and Tiru almost instantly has kept me from
getting discouraged in the LFG hunt.

Anyway, Enjoy life the best you can
