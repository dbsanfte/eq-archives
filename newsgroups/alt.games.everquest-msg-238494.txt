Simply have a friend that can cast an illusion such as DE, Orge or
Troll and con the golem at the entrance - or buy illusion potions in
the bazaar. It takes time but there are a lot of sarnak ruins in OT.
The hammer is useful but it only casts during combat, so if you pick a
nasty mob you could be dead before it processes.
