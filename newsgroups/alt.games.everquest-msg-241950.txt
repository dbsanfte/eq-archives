Heck, would make my day if the 50+ to 65's would quit KSing the lower
levels.  I've given up on playing my alts in those zones due to the KSing.
Last night, a friend and me were taking out the commander with our level 38
and 36 alts.  I went out and pulled commander and noticed someone following
us...when we got it down to about 55%, he nuked it away from us and gave the
sword to his alt.  When I checked my log, he never even attempted to touch
it until we had it close to half health.  That's just not right.  I didn't
even need the sword, it's just the point.  KSing just isn't right.  To date,
/report has not even gotten a response.
