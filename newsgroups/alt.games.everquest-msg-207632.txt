Actually, I two-box a Bard as the "secondary" to my Paladin,
and it works out surprisingly well.  True, twisting three songs
is mostly too much keyboard juggling (although still possible when
necessary), but two is easy with appropriate
hotkeys, and even one (i.e., "set and forget" for the duration
of a fight) works just fine for most situations.

Although I do much more with him, I get huge increases in
efficiency even on days when I'm feeling lazy just by
using the Snare/Slow song during fights (and autofight
from the rear of the mob, Bards put out pretty good melee
damage if they're not being squashed like a bug), mana song
between fights, and Selos when traveling (or running for
my life).

Probably not as efficient as a shaman/paladin duo, but
a heck of a lot of fun, and more versatile in some ways,
since Bards are such a "Swiss Army knife" with their big
bag of tricks.

See my post yesterday in the "most powerful overall duo" thread.
