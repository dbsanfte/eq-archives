	Archery.

	Initial reports from SF are that Hartsman doesn't like Endless Quiver, and
feels that Rangers are doing too much damage with Archery.  VanCouvering is
shucking and jiving us on the Glade that they don't have anything planned and
they'll let us know beforehand if they change Archery...but currently on Test,
arrows break root.  Must be unbalancing if Rangers can take 20 minutes to kill
a mob a Druid could quad in 5.
