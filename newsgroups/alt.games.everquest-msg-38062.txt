If it comes to their attention because someone complains that their
account was compromised, then they will get canceled.  However, if it
comes to their attention because, say, a GM sees you talking about it in
guildchat, they are very unlikely to do anything.  Heck, Verant even
stated once that they looked into actually supporting account sharing,
but couldn't think of a way to do it that wouldn't lead to too many
customer service problems...that's a pretty good sign that they don't
really have a problem with account sharing per se, they just don't want
to have the problems that it can lead to.
