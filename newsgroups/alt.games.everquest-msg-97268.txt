 Hello all. What in the world is the best way to get to Overthere? I tried
to go thru FM's last night and stayed lost the whole time in there. I was at
the spot the map said the entrance was but couldn't see a dang thing. The
problem is those stupid giants can see thru inv. and are everywhere. I spent
more time running and hiding than anything. I know you can come in thru
Oasis but am kos there. I've heard something about taking the boat and
jumping off early but figure if you do and do it wrong yours in for a mess.
haha  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.  =)
