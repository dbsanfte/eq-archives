I have a sneaking suspicion that this did play a part. I've noticed at 
least the server I played on to drop significantly in population since 
launch.

I can imagine a scenario where declining numbers led them to give the 
green light to this sort of drastic field test.

I can't imagine they would ever have underestimated Blizzard's success 
in this market.

This is serious business. Many players see this as heresy, a betrayal of 
the public trust in the name of the almighty dollar. They claim that 
demand was high for this sort of service. I never knew that to be the 
case, but of course that could be due to the fact that this sort of 
practice has always been view as reprehensible by most players, so I 
just didn't see much of it. Odd though that they would facilitate a 
practice typically disapproved of by the player base.

My worry is that coinage won't do people a lot of good if sellers can 
actually get real money for their items.

If they don't step up their persecution of the IGE's, then I agree. This 
will just legitimize them, thereby increasing their presence.

If it works here, you can bet on it being in every game they have before 
long.

Oh, it's already stirred up. Swizzlestick Online Entertainment has seen 
to that. We're just riding the waves and trying to stay afloat.
