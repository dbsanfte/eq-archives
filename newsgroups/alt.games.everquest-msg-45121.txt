1) I was paraphrasing a bit.  I appologize for using quotation marks, that was
a mistake on my part.

2) Given up on X no archiving your posts yet, so they could be searched for?

3) I have better things to do with my time.

Liar.    You posted several times about your habit of repeatedly doing Paw
camps.

Of course.  That explains the frothing.

Hey, moron.

Here is a quote from a couple lines above.

Still deny that you said it?

My god, you really do enjoy these flame wars, don't you.  It was an offhand
comment, you're the one trying to blow it up into some big fucking deal.

Whatever, I'm done giving you your amusement.  You can go masturbate over
someone elses posts.  Although I'm sure you'll begin to stalk me through the
newsgroup posting bullshit one liners after every message of mine (given up on
the pot shots at Dan yet?) as you so often accuse others of doing.
