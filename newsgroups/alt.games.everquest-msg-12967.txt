Why I feel the need to respond to this, I do not know but here it goes.

Had you read my post
"Headed to Kunark. LoIO, OT, FM, WW, you name it, I went there. No one needs
a warrior. Hell, other than LoIO, most places are deserted."......."Went to
Lavastorm, SolA and B, NRo, SRo, the swamp, Ferrot and everywhere in
between. Deserted or filled with low level people."

Over the past 35 levels I have grouped with dozens of people. In 35 levels I
have died 7 times and none of those times where while I was in a group. I
always give half of my loot to the cleric on duty since they cannot usually
loot because they are medding. I know my job, I do my job, and I do it well.
I stand there and get beat up keeping the attention of the MOB while
inflicting as much damage as I can.

I am fairly certain that people do not keep me on a friends list and log off
the moment they see me coming towards the zone they are in. I go out of my
way to help others. From killing a MOB that is tearing them apart to giving
away items and Plat to help them get where they want to be. Here's a perfect
example of How I am in-game.

--I went to Crystal Caverns and ran across an Herbologist. When I killed
him, he dropped a Crystal Covered Shroud. This is a pretty nice item for a
caster. I am a warrior and have no need for it at all. Price Check on it was
1500-1700pp. Now, I could have made a fortune. I could have sold it for
enough to Purchase a dozen SoW potions. Instead I sold it for....get
ready.......Nothing. That's right, nothing. Why? Am I crazy? No. I ran
across a caster that I had grouped with in the past. He had been saving and
saving for an item he wanted. If he had paid me for it, then he would not
have gotten the item he wanted (or it would have taken him a lot longer) so
I gave it to him. This may sound crazy to you but to me, having something th
at is such a good item for a caster sitting in my bank unused just because
someone cannot afford to pay the price I want seems ridicules. If it had
cost me something, I would have felt different, But it didn't. It was free,
therefore I gave it to him for free--

This is how I play. I do everything I can for the people around me. I never
beg for anything. No SoW? No problem, May take a little longer but I'll run
without it. Picked up something for free and I can't use it? Here you go.
It's yours (If they offer a little I take it.....I'm not crazy....But I do
not *require* payment of any sort).

My reasons for not being able to find a group reside in the fact that
everywhere I go is either deserted or the groups are full. (I can count up
to 6, so I can see that the group has no room) or the people are to low for
me to group with. My question to this NG was "What do you do when this
happens to you?" "What zones should I visit that has more people so I have a
better chance of finding a group with a spot open?" "What advice can you
give me?" (Too bad none of the Server status monitors can tell me how many
people are in each zone. Then I would know exactly where to go).

I thank those of you that answered my question with helpful comments. They
do show me that I am not alone and I am in a place that many others have
been in from time to time. It seems that, at certain levels, groups are
easier or harder to find depending on level. It would appear that it is just
another one of those things that I have to wait through and be patient. I
started a trade skill so that, while I am waiting for spots to open up, I
can be doing something constructive. This has helped me a great deal. I am
getting into groups at a normal rate, but I have something interesting to do
in the meantime (Brewing is now up to 95 and pottery is up to 80.....I know,
lame skills but fun when you have to test your drinks). By the time I hit
40, I should be an expert drunk....uuumm...I mean Brewer.
