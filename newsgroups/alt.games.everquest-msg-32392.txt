Exactly.
If I get a drive by clarity and see the caster right in front of me, I
toss a sow. If I don't see the caster or don't even know who cast it,
I'll /say thanks! and hope the caster sees the message. There *is* a
certain degree of unspoken understanding here, but it still hinges on
the buff being volunteered or at least requested, and on people
realizing they're not going to get the "counterbuff" every time
without asking for it.
