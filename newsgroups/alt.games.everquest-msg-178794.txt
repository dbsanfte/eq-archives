I'd like to see a server, role playing or not, that restricted
the game to the original world.  Maybe add Kunark, maybe Velious,
but not Luclin and above?  Why draw the line there?  Because that
where the hardware requirements take a serious upgrade.  This
would provide those of us who, for whatever reasons, don't want
to upgrade, or just want to play the original game.  The original
world is so empty now, because, I guess, Verant is rewarding
everyone who buys the upgrades, that the game suffers
tremendously.  While I don't long for the days of waiting in line
to join a camp, it's silly when I can go to Oasis, W Commonlands,
Guk, High Pass, or even the Misty Thicket, and be the only player
in the zone.  In addition, I think the easy transport system of
Luclin, and now the ridiculous POP books, removes a large portion
of the flavor of the game.
