my monk has 54 mr with buffs (bad, i know, but he really hasn't got good
resist gear) and he was finding very green mobs who couldn't touch him
before, can now root him, and light blue mobs are much more dangerous;
reassuring as he approaches the 50's mark. Oh well, mobs i can't get xp from
will now be able to kick me around like a half flat football. Joy joy joy.

I guess on the plus side, makers of resist gear will do nicely.
