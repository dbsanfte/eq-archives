I have no idea how pervasive the Oracle 9 bug may have been or
how long it took Oracle to fix it, but I *can* see that the
previous poster was saying the "switch from Oracle 9 to 8 due
to a bug" was something that happened to SWG Beta, not EQ Beta.
So if you pointed out when EQ Beta was because you thought this
meant the story had to be false, well, try again.
