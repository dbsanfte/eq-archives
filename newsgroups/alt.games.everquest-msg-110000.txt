Not what I said.  If a person does not know what he does is wrong then
he is innocent, but if he merely lies and says it's ok then he is
guilty.  This is a personal morality.  In fact the law also does allow
for "innocent by reason of insanity" which is another way of saying
"was not able to tell right from wrong".

You are correct that the law is "the attempt to legislate a subset of
morality".  But that does not mean that you can logically define
morality by referring to the law since the law is defined by referring
to morality.  That would be a circular definition.
