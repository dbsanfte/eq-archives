uh no. Warriors have a HUGE advantage in hit points. They have a small
advantage in armor class. They have a LARGE advantage in the block skill
shared only with monks. They have a ridiculously large advantage in the
defensive skill .

On the other hand they are supposed to do significantly less dammage than
monks,rogues,wizards, magicians, and perhaps beastmasters. The wizards and
magicians are still waiting.

Even the wizard can tank a blow or 3. Never confuse the ability to take a
whack with being the absolute best hands down at it.

Oh and martin if your monk is tanking your pulling dain wrong :p Everyone
knows it is the cleric who should be tanking:)
