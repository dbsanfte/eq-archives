At the wizard evac spots, EJ is fairly safe, but SF is dangerous. I've
ported to SF maybe 6 times (don't fight in Kunark a whole lot), and only
once have I not picked up a mob on zone-in. Cazic-Thule is also kinda hairy
at the level you actually get it (34), I usually get jumped by a (now very
green) warder about half the time.
