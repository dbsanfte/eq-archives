Sorry to assault the possible innocent victims on the other newsgroups...
But for the future, do not crosspost this junk to other newsgroups.

As for the matter on hand...  We have already argued this issue on our own
newsgroup, that being alt.games.everquest.  The fact of the matter at this
time, is that shocker@ua.com is sadly misinformed, and woefully jumping the
gun.  Any addiction is not the fault of the provider of things, with the
exception of illegal drugs.  Every addiction does make it the user's
responsibility to try and exercise some self control, and at the same time,
it is also the loved one's responsibility to help a person who is addicted
to break the cycle in question.  Given the mother was well aware of her
son's problems, despite the fact that he is 21, does not mean a mother is
absolved of her own responsibilities to her son.

I am not saying that she is fully responsible, but she has no real right or
claim to money to damages she saw happening before her, and failed to do
anything about it after the fact.  Excuses asside, warning labels on
'potentially' addictive games is as useless as warning signs on cigarettes,
alcohol and gambling.  People will continue to smoke, drink and gamble, it
requires ourselves to not drink in excess, or to stop smoking or gamble
ourselves into debt, and it is the same for us not to take a game way to
seriously.

The hype of how the media and games of recent have 'desensitized' the youth
of America and in some cases other countries, can, strangely enough, be
pointed out in one comic book story.  By treating out children in a bubble
environment, where their sole understanding of the world is through TV or a
microcosm where it has no real true interaction of the parent or at least
the attempt at such, will create the very problem 'concerned' parents are
worried about.  It is NOT the role of the government to instruct the
parent's children on proper form, it is the PARENTS role to help form it.
It is NOT the game or entertainment groups fault for 'desensitizing' the
child to the effects, it is the PARENTS fault for using the media and games
themselves to be the substitute for being there for their children.

Surprisingly enough, it does require human interaction and cooperation in
Everquest to progress further into the game.  It requires a sense of trust
to do certain things, and like real life...  There are people with bad
intentions as well.  One of the things stated on the box is that it is
recommended for Teens, which means there will be issues that will require
someone a bit more mature, not someone who is 6 to 12.  Adults play this
possibly to remember the days of Dungeons and Dragons, or a game that
doesn't require to be twitch oriented.  Either case, the majority of us
know when to say, "Ok...  I got to go."

This is the point of anything we do...  Knowing when to say, "Time to
stop."  It isn't the job of anyone else to tell you what to do.  But, if
you feel concern for someone, you shouldn't just ignore the problem and
hope it will go away, you should help or try and do something about it,
don't have someone else do it for you.
