No, you don't. You're a whining little pansy ass who feels that
everyone should kiss your ass and try to make you feel better. You
think you're special because you had friends die. You're not. Cars
crash. Planes crash. Trains derail. House fires claim lives. Murderers
kill people. Every day, more people die senselessly than did in the
WTC attack. People lose fathers, brothers, friends, mothers, sisters,
spouses to violence daily.

Beleive it or not, there are a LOT of people who don't think it's
appropriate for there to be a "Never forget 9-11" banner in EQ.

There's a time and place to mourn. EQ ain't it.

The events were tragic. The lives lost are a tragedy. Instead of
staying hooked on the death of your friends, why not celebrate the
time that you had with them when they were alive?

You think Verant was insensitive for not putting up a memorial MOTD?
Well, I think it's even more insensitive to choose the tragic events
of a year ago as a springboard to use to flame and insult them and to
call them "unamerican fucks" because they choose to remember in a
quiet, respectful manner and let others do the same.

I see one heartless, childish bastard here. It's you.
