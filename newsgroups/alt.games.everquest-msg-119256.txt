You do realize that they can't *actively* monitor guildchat. Yes, they
have logs, but those have to be opened externally. There is no
realtime monitoring of guildchat without actually being in the guild.

Also, was it a GM or a GUIDE you who was in the zone? The difference
is critical here. If it was a guide, guides have NO way to know what
was said in your guild chat even after the fact. They have no access
to any server-side logs, and your guildchat never reaches them
client-side since they're not in your guild.

Something happened to Tunare. Could have been any number of things
from bug to "feature". Frankly, you're being an idiot for assuming the
guide/GM killed her out of spite. A GM would be risking his paycheck.
A guide would be risking his position in the program and possibly his
play account as well. (Yes, guides CAN have their play accounts banned
over abuse of guide powers)
