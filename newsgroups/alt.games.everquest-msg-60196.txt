Wow, how absurd is that!?!?

I would hazard to say that when running a business, in general doing
what the customer wants *is* doing it right.

Your statement should properly read "... the players don't want PvP
done the way I think is right".

Don't confuse "fair fight" with "fair rules". All reasonable players
want fair rules, by which I mean rules that apply equally to everyone.
We have that. What individual combatants do within those rules will
determine if they win or lose an engagement.


Frankly, I don't think it possible that *your* concept of "fair" could
ever be implemented in a reasonable battle simulation, because you
seem intent on removing human variability from the picture. 

Taken to an extreme, you'll be insisting that a chess master have a
lobotomy before you will play against him. Otherwise, even though
you're following the same rules, it just wouldn't be fair.
