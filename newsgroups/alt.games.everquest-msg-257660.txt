Woops, missed this email before replying to the other. Seems you do
acknowledge that line.

I guess I'll just leave it that while, in principle, I also prefer #2,
especially IRL, in my MMORPGs I #1 for things like killstealing.  Just
simplifies my life if I don't have to be responsible for teaching someone
