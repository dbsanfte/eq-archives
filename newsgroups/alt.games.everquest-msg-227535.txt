The strangest guild death I've seen was of Halo of Fire on Bristlebane.
This is second-hand and not too detailed since I wasn't a member; I just
knew a few people and had grouped and raided with them a few times.  If
anyone out there knows more, feel free to add and correct me.

Anyway, their founder and guildleader had been retired for a while now
and someone else had taken over as GL, and everything seemed to be
just fine.  The founder came back one day though, and managed to convince
the current leader to turn over the GL tag temporarily.  However, within
hours of getting it, he disbanded the guild.

This was of course met with confusion and anger by most of the members.
It wasn't simply a prank; the founder felt justified in doing so
because he didn't like the current state of the guild or something like
that, and thought he had the right to do so as founder.  Whether he
did or not was debatable, but irrelevant at that point anyway.

He might have been on to something; rather than reform, most of the
members scattered to various other guilds, so perhaps there was too
much internal friction to remain viable anyway.  It's still the most
sudden guild death I know of though.
