I use Bigpond Cable for the sole reason it is the only cable I can get and I
don't want to go ADSL (I have a ingrained distrust of anything relying on
Plain Old Telephone System), but I can assure you I am far from happy with
Bigpond as a service provider. There usenet server has always been shite -
posts are only kept for 7 days and a lot of posts don't come through at all
compared to news.uq.edu.au here at work.

Telstra also have frequent DNS issues and do not follow industry best
practices: ie, all their DNS servers are on the same subnet so when that
subnet fails... *gurgling sound*

But the biggest thing I dislike is their traffic quota - you get billed both
ways on their broadband. Uploading and downloading traffic both come off
your quota. This is unusual to say the least and can be a real killer in
online gaming. This is not just with individual account holders either -
this is reflected in their dealings with other ISP's as they do not
recognise peering at all. They claim "they have no peer in Australia" and
hence the reason the ACCC watchdog is itching to take a bite out of them at
the moment.

Bascially they are assholes. Anyway  - I will be moving soon, my next place
is going to have Optus Cable I swear : )
