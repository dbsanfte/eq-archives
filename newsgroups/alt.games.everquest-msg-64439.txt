  Also, for those of us who just get stuck on the "Checking for updated
files, please wait..." part, at least one person on the board has posted
that after leaving the patcher on and leaving the computer, she came back to
find that it was actually downloading, albeit very slowly.  So it may just
be congestion afterall.

  Good luck.
