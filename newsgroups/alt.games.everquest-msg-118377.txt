And for that kind of use, I have no argument with Java. Unfortunately,
I've seen more than one firm insisting on using Java for applications
that are and will always be single platform, apparently for no reason
except that they read that it's the Best New Thing, and therefore they
blindly feel they should be using it.

Proof positive that politics isn't the only field with its fair share
of idiots.
