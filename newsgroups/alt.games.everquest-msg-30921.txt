All runes, pages and words are part of the torturous Research skill that INT
casters are subject to if they want some of their most important spells
(they have to make them, not buy them).

A lot of the researched spells are ALSO buyable and unless you want to keep
track of which are which (a royal pain, even for those who HAVE to know
them) I'd either give them to the correct class or sell them to merchants.

- All runes go to wizards
- All pages (even the ones that look like words) go to enchanters
- MOST words go to necros, but about a dozen (there's about 4 dozen total
words) go to magicians.

I've never been in a group that said "no" when I asked if I could have
<whatever> piece of research material for the class I was playing.
