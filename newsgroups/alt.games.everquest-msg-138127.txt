There are several Dragon scales that are dropped, besides the ones for the
wurmy. Being a Dark Elf you can do the part involving Tektite without any
problem. I would do the Tektite quest get the Scale then head to Burning
Woods and try trading for the other 2 Scales. Gylon or whatever his name, is
not too bad a 40 Druid might be able to kite by bringing to the zone. They
other wurm Alazlon will be much togher due to location (by the Giant
Stronghold).
