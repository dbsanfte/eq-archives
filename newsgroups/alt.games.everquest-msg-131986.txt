Education is indeed important, but not disinformed brainwashing.

AIDS is a farce perpetrated upon the world population by a global
medical-pharmaceutical-industrial complex. It makes a lot of money for
a lot of people at the expense of the wellbeing, health, and even
lives of it's victims.

AIDS itself is not a single disease, but a medical definition. It
consists of being HIV positive in conjunction with any of a number of
"indicator" diseases (tuberculosis, cervical cancer, etc.). The list
of indicator diseases in the U.S. is constantly growing, giving the
illusion of the spread of AIDS. Furthermore, the list of indicator
diseases in the U.S. is different than the list in Africa, which is
different from the list in Asia, etc. This means that a person
diagnosed with AIDS in Africa could come to the U.S. and they would no
longer have AIDS. The symptoms of HIV + indicator disease are
identical to the indicator disease alone.

HIV is a retrovirus and unremarkable in this regard. It has not been
demonstrated to be contagious except in very rare circumstances.
Contracting HIV will result in mild flu like symptoms for one to two
weeks followed by immunity to further infection.

Testing for HIV consists not of checking for the presence of the virus
itself - it is too rare in the human bloodstream, even during the peak
of infection - but checking for the presence of HIV antibodies. This
would be the same as checking for Chicken Pox antibodies, and, if
found, declaring you to be infected with Chicken Pox. The presence of
antibodies indicates immunity to the disease, not infection.

HIV is commonly treated with AZT. AZT was developed in the 1960's for
chemotherapy but deemed too dangerous. Oddly, the symptoms of AZT
poisoning are similar to those purported for AIDS. The result being
that a healthy patient found to be HIV positive is told that they are
going to die a lingering, painful death, then given a drug that kills
them in just that way. Read that last sentence again. People are being
killed by a treatment for a disease they don't have.

AIDS education is important. Try these links if you want to learn
