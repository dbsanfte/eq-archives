I agree. Look here : http://mmogchart.com/ the numbers here for EQ don't
show that it is heading for the grave. Granted WoW may have more people than
EQ2, but that doesn't mean it is better. Both have their pros and cons, but
both games are still new, though EQ2 does have 5+ years of EQ lore to fall
back on.
