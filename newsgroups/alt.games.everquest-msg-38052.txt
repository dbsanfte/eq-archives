On losing connection.

I have had this problem from our work network and determined that it is the
firewall.  I have not found out the exact cause because I can't justify
messing with the firewall because EQ isn't working.  My guess is that some
TCP/UDP ports are open and others are not.  It randomly allows me to connect
and play for a while, then I drop to the server screen and get the "You
already have a character" message.

If I were you, I'd get a 30-day free trial dial up account from some other
vendor and attempt to connect that way.  At least you can determine if its
your system or your network.  That's exactly what I did.  Plugged my laptop
into my office phone and used earthlink to connect.  (After hours of course
:) )
