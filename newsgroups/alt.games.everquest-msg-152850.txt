Eh, they aren't junk, they're just a rip-off.  From all I've seen, they work 
just fine, but there is generally a cheaper card that does just as well.  Ie, 
for the GF 4 MX, it was the GF 3 Ti200 thingy.  MX means it's a dumbed-down 
card... so it's based on the GF 4 chip, but a bit of the power's been removed 
somehow so it ends up not being any better than he next level down, but they 
can still put GF 4 on the box and charge more for it.  Even a GF 2 MX400 is 
still reasonable for EQ, though.
