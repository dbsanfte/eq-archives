Well, some others who have passed the mark may give you a more accurate
timeframe, but I am specifically waiting for level 30 for my Ranger before
going to Runnyeye. The biggest thing at 30 is the SoW which gives a fighting
chance to zone once the proverbial hits the fan - as it most surely does on
regular occasions. Outdoors, tracking and plain olde "watching your six"
keep a Ranger out of strife, but indoors I am guessing you would be
stumbling into MoB's aggro range before you actually see them quite
frequently. Wandering MoB's are pretty hard to avoid in corridors as opposed
to in the middle of a plains so add's are a  much bigger problem.

Soloing shouldn't be a problem though - I actually find it easier to solo
than group even though it is a lot slower xp-wise... No little fella's to
look after though, just a girlfriend who has a knack for inventing tasks
that need requiring as soon as the EQ logo appears....  : )
