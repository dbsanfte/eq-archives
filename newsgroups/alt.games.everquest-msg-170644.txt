Been having connection problems of my own (turns out there is some local
problem on base with Comcast that they are working to solve).  Try going to
www.dslreports.com and going to Our Tools, and Speed Tests, and run one of
those.  Find out if your download speed is where it should be (within the
range your provider advertises).  Also www.2wire.com has a bandwidth test
that you can run over and over (the one on dslreports is limited on usage by
one person).
