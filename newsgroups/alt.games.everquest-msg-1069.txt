Rogues can put "pick lock" on a button, and make a hot key for it.
They can press the hot key.  It greys out for a while, and then becomes
usable again.

Why?

The way a Rogue picks a lock is by putting his or her lockpicks on the
cursor, and then clicking on the locked item (or hitting the "u" key).
So, anyone know what use a "pick lock" button is?
