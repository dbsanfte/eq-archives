*Shrug*  I don't think I could say any class is more prone to that than 
any other.  Personally, I was most amused by the time it was the MA not 
paying attention, heh. "Dude, what're you waiting for?  Get aggro! Call 
assist! Argh! We're dead!"

I can make some educated guesses.  It never hurts to find out if others 
have thought of reasons that I haven't.  I've never seen these wipes, but 
that'd largely be because non-hold pets seem to be banned on 90% of our 
raids, so granted, yes, they don't happen.  On the rare occasions I -have- 
seen pet-induced wipe, it's usually because all the pets were on the same 
side, or three 'small army of pets' people all triggered that AA from the 
same side, and pushed the dang mob through a wall.  I really don't see 
where /pet hold is gonna help with that.  But more of our pet  casters 
having spent more time actually using a pet on a raid, now... that 
-might- help avoid those wipes.

True, but you still gotta draw an imaginary line somewhere and say 'I'm 
allowing this much room.'

We have a buttload of beastlords, particularly.  (That -is- the right 
collective noun, isn't it? :) )  All told, probably 10-15% of any given 
raid is assorted pet casters.  And that's not even counting our usual 
school of shamans and flock of enchanters. 

We can argue all day about what makes up a 'sizable fraction of DPS'.  But 
when we wipe on a mob at 1%, clearly our DPS was about 1% too low, hm?  If 
telling all our non-pet-/hold pet users not to use a pet only costs us 
2-3%, we still have to consider the tradeoffs.

Well... at least one of the classes who have pets, don't even -get- it.  
Many of our pet casters surely do have that AA.  But I guarantee it's a 
pretty low priority for enchanters, since we have to talk SOE into letting 
us have it first.  And there are some guildies that I wouldn't fault for 
putting that one off, and working on getting say, level 65 first.
