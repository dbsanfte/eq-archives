    And here is more proof that nobody at VI plays a cleric or has a single
fucking clue what a cleric does versus what other healers do. Let me just
get this out of my system first:

    UNLESS YAULP V GIVES ME DOUBLE ATTACK AND ENHANCED MANA REGEN IT IS A
USELESS POS! IT WILL ONLY BE USED TO CARRY HEAVY LOADS AND BEFORE SMITHING
COMBINES!!!

    Ok, that felt good. ;-)

    Looks to be too slow to be a good "fast heal", but the healing per
second chain-casting it would be an upgrade on DL. I'd really have to play
with it for a bit to see if it would crack the healing lineup. What's the
range on it - same as DL?

    This spell is so worthless for a level 60 cleric it makes me wince. For
50 mana more, at the same spell level, I can COMPLETE HEAL EVERYONE IN MY
GODDAMN PARTY! Why would a level 60 cleric want this watered down piece of
shit? The faster casting time is meaningless, because this is a heal over
time anyways - this won't be saving anyone that WoR won't save. But do you
know what really burns me? THIS is the spell the druids should have got.
This would have been something they didn't have before, which is damned
useful. And had they got it at level 54, when they're going to get the 75%
CH instead, it would have been very useful for a good chunk of their careers
(modulo tinkering with the mana cost a bit). If these four spells are what
they're offering the cleric community in return for whoring out CH, screw
them.
