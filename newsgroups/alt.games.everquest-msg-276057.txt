This is just an update and addendum:

VS was taken down by SoE on Vazaelle and has not be bought back up
since the patch few days ago.

I know VS is one tough mob but as I was saying on the night of the
battle, he had impossibly high resist. Malo was used since it is
unresistable but nearly all of my beast dot and nukes were resisted
and that had never happened to me before.  The nukes I got in were
migtated to sub-50 damage. The person leading the raid is a wizard who
has done this before and he couldn't get ONE nuke to land at all.
This is why we all thought vs was bugged.  In the group that night was
another wizard, 2 chanty, 54 ranger (bags full of arrows) and a mage
along with 65 pally as backup tank.

2 70 clerics against vs would have been overkill in most cases but not
that day.
