Hello,
I'm the editor of www.impulsegamer.com, an up and coming online games review
website. We are currently looking for writers who would like to do reviews
of games for us. Please note that this is an unpaid position as we don't
make a cent out of the site, that is something we are planning for the
future. However if you would like to write for us please drop us a line at
this address. If you are interested, have a look at the site and you will
see our format is extremely easy to write reviews for.

Serious respondents only please, no flamers.

Tory.
