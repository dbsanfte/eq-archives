That may be the cruxt of the problem. Regardless of what happens or how 
it turns out, is there really any reason to be overly "bitter" about any 
of it? So you purchase a game (if you actually *do* go ahead and do so 
after experiencing the beta - I'd wager you will) and it falls short of 
your expectations. What are we, six? Let's keep it in perspective. If it 
isn't what you were hoping for, walk away. There is no sense in an adult 
(in their 50's no less?) getting so emotional about it.

Yeah, yeah, blah, blah about throwing $50 or $75 down the drain. You're 
not new here. That's the risk you run with *any* PC game today. I'd be 
fully in favor of a system which prevents that possibility, but that's 
for another discussion.
