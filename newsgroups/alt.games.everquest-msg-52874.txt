I'm a level 16 warrior, talked to a guy on top of the gates at Qeynos, and
he said that if I kill Robbie Shilster, who wanders the plains of NK, and
bring back his helm, blah, blah, blah....

I'm in NK, but don't know where this Robbie Shilster charactar is, nor do I
have any idea what level he is.  People I ask don't seem to know, and I
can't find him on quest servers.  Any ideas or help?

I'm getting destroyed by some monsters in NK, which I expect, but I don't
want to spend too much time looking if I can't kill Robbie anyway!

Thanks,

Mike
