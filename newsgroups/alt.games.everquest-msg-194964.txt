Bards are about the best soloer they can do just about anything if you can
twist (play more then one song ).

snare,charm,fear,mez,haste,slow,buff,debuff,dots,dd,
lull,heal,(clarity(mana regen for others),locate
corpses,invisability,(faster then sow travel)selos .this is possible beacuse
they dont have to stop to sing new songs and not many songs need man to
work.no doubt i have missed some of there abilities but you get the idea of
what they can do.
at lvl 12 they get there first dd so killing anything that doesnt cast or
whole groups of them(one at a time) is no problem.
just beware that you will not get much time to talk or do anything else
because you will be none stop at the keybord.
hehe yes i have a bard lvl 50, also bst lvl 36,necro lvl 22,mage lvl
28,enchanter lvl 23,monk lvl 30,druid lvl 36,shadowknight lvl 25.
