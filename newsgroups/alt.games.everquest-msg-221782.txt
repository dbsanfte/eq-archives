HI All;

I've not been much into making a fashion statement. But, lately thinking of
making myself all one particular color. I believe I understand the basics,
buying a prismatic dye in the bazaar, then apply it to the slot I want,
adjust the tint while looking at a preview window then save. However, the
info I can't seem to find is: what if at some point I don't like the color
or just plain get tired of it. How do I remove the dye and revert back to
the slot's default, meaning, whatever is in the slot is what I see???

Also, if there are any tricks or quirks that might happen to me during this
process, I would appreciate a heads up. A search of this group only turned
up the basic "how do I dye" question.

Thank you all in advance for your time in answering this question.
