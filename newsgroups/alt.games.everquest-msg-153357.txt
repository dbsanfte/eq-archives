This is all well and good, and certainly a case where a wizard using a
weapon is helpful. However, you are speaking mainly of PL'ing
circumstances. Under normal conditions, I still see little need as a
wizard (in my 20's) to even carry a weapon. Any melee I could provide
would be a joke, proc or no proc, and only take away from med time for
more effective casting.
