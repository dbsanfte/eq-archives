    I'm very happy for you.  But what in this thread gave you any idea
that anyone here wanted to disconnect with this "addition"? (Running a
spell checker isn't enough.  You have to also check to see if the word
it suggests is correct in the context you are using it.)  Believe it or
not, it is possible to play this game for entertainment, without having
it adversely affect other areas of one's life.  Please explain why I
should trust you or care one whit about anything you are prattling on
about?

    Posts like this remind me of a reformed alcoholic wandering up to
people at a cocktail party and lecturing them on how it's possible to
kick the lure of demon rum if they just have a bit a strength of
character like _they_ did, never considering that some people are
capable of finding balance without any help.
