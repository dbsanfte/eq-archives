As I don't petition of any names that aren't so blatantly derogatory and/or
sexual that my "public conscience" kicks in to protect any kids that might
be playing, convincing a GM isn't an issue.  Lokari's simple, unable to be
misconstrued statement leads me to conclude that she must not use Lokari, a
name that violates the naming rules (however obscurely) and is "by
definition" offensive to her.  I was just checking the facts.
