The lag is not because of a connection slowdown between you and the game
server.  The lag is due to the large number of people that are crammed in
such a small area. When you are in the Bazaar your system is trying to
process each one of their animations at one time. This illustrates the
limitations of the graphics engine that SONY is using in the game.  To solve
the problem turn your clip plane to zero.  You will not see very far in
front of you but then you will be able to walk around in the bazaar without
too much hesitation.  Then when you leave, set your clip plane back to where
you prefer it to be.
