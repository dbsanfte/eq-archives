I just made level 34.   Went to Iceclad - I was the only one there I think :) 
Snared 3 snow cougars (dark blue) and ran around casting Lightning Strike until
they all died.  Is this the proper way of doing this?  For some reason I
thought there was an area effect DOT???
Also, it seems to me that I was getting just as good experience kiting ONE
yellow cockatrice in the overthere.  I think I'd be leary of trying to kite
several yellows because they tend to resist my spells more often.  Am I missing
something?
