I had the exact same problem yesterday. Logged in but was told I wasn't
subscribed. I checked my credit card account and the last payment had been
made on 2nd August so it should have been billed again on 2nd November. My
card expired in September but like yours the number stayed the name, only
the expiry date changed. (Also it's a Mastercard like yours).

I'd been meaning to swap my sub to my other card (Visa) with a lower
interest rate anyway so I did that and it worked fine.

So it looks like if your card expires you have to renew your subscription
even if the actual card number stays the same.
