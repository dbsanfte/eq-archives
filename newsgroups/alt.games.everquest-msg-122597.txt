The upper level game is anything BUT boring.

The problem you're facing is that you're a LONG LONG LONG way from the upper
level game.

The other problem is that you don't have the time to devote to really
playing the upper level game.

So, your choices are:

1. Twink some other toon and have a little fun, such as a monk

2. Stop playing if it's too boring.

3. Adjust your playstyle and group up in a dungeon, or join a pickup fear
raid.  Lemme tell YOU, nothing is more exciting than the creative ways
people can die on pickup fear raids.
