Unfortunately no, but I'm remaining hopeful. I re-upped EQ for a few months
to see if that would help - probably not but here's hoping. From what I've
read it takes the best (for me personally) of EQ and SWG and kind of melds
them. But after the total dejection after seeing SWG go the route it's gone
I'm kind of guarded about it now.
