    He didn't say that formula 10 uses 18.4 minutes always. He said formula
10 is used to calculate the duration.

    Each spell seems to have a (minlevel, maxlevel, value_minlevel,
value_maxlevel) associated with it. Minlevel and maxlevel are the levels at
which the minimum and maximum duration of the spell occur, and value_x is
the actual duration at x. How do you decide what the duration is between
those two points? Easiest way is a straight line, where duration(level
between min and max) = value_minlevel + (value_maxlevel -
value_minlevel)x(current level - minlevel)/(maxlevel-minlevel). His theory
is that if the spell uses durationformula 10, that tells the game to compute
duration using a formula like the above.
