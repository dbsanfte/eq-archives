    Because the average pure melee has no effective damage mitigation
techniques, at least nowhere near those of good soloists. That is one
mistake in my post I'd like to correct now - replace "soloists" with "good
solo classes". The classes that solo poorly (cleric, rogue, warrior, and now
monk) are classes that are in higher demand for groups, so they have
efficient XP options available. This is balanced, or rather as balanced as
it's going to get. Trying to shoehorn everyone into XP groups, regardless of
what a class is best designed to do (like classes with higher AoE DPS than
single-target DPS, or classes with damage output that has efficiency as a
function of time), is going to be just as big a waste of time as trying to
turn those four classes into solo classes.
