    Blazzax quads for 5700. That's four hits, each for 5700 damage max. The
charm chickens now have a charm that cannot be resisted. And so forth. I
feel for guilds that just made the elemental planes like Monual's, as now
it's pretty much a catch 22. You require elemental gear to farm elemental
mobs. But hey, apparently the drop tables have been updated, so the people
that have been there for months will have something new to do! =/
