You mean magazines like Computer Gaming World?

I read their DAoC review and it was complete crap. The writer mentions
serveral negatives (such as lack of content), and then procedes to
give it 4.5/5 stars and declare it king of the MMPRPGs.

From all of the reviews I have read online and off, most reviews
appear to be ex-EQers with an axe to grind.

DAoC is a good game and a worthy competetor to EQ, but it is not
superior or ground breaking. 

>Ding Dong the King is dead

Yeah right....Do you write for CGW?

When DAoC (or any other MMPRPG) is 3 years old and still has the same
number of susbscribers as EQ does now, then you can declare a new
king.
