I'm no bible quoter but even I am quite familiar with the line:

"Let ye who have not sinned cast the first stone."

But more importantly, not everyone who is executed by the state in a 
capital punishment system is going to be guilty. That means every now 
and then the state "murders" somebody innocent. And the blood is on 
every citizens hands who support that system.

Actually Old Testament is not Christrian doctrine by and large. 
Christian doctrine is the (good) example of Christ's life and teachings. 
Even a non-christian like me knows that.
