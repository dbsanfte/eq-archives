OK  Here yuo go.
For the force feed to work you need 2 of the Stat food and drink.  you don't
get the effects of the sta untill you eat one, and then eq just checks that
the next thing you are suposed to auto eat is the same thing.
So stat food in slot 1,  Stat drink in slot 2, Fish roll's in slot 3(verry
eaasy to make fresh fish, and batwings last for 1.5-2 hours don't remember
the exact number), Fuzzlecutter formula 5000 ( 2.5 gp lasts 1.5 hours)

First go get an eag timer that goes to 45 min.  Set it for 40- 44 min (you
want a little lee-way when you are talking about 1000+pp worth of
expendables) Eat one Stat food and drink, now right click on a fish roll and
a FF5K you should eather get a **** cakes a bite, or a You could not posobly
eat a nother thing.  When the buzzer goes off just right click on the
regular food and reset the alarm.  Remeber to force feed when you first sign
on, and those 4 Items will last for ever...  Unless you lose the effect when
you die... Been lucky haven't done that in a long time, not since I found
out about this..  :nocks on wood.

Now you may have seen that I said that the 2 none stat foods I mentioned
last for at least 1.5 hours, but that I am telling you to eat every more
often then haff that time.  Well that is because when you force feed your
self you only get half the time value. a snack only last minutes.

As for the race diferences there is only one race that I know of the eates
more than the others and that is Halflings.  doesn't make sence that those
little people eat so much, but they do get that great +5% mod to XP.

The food has to go into one of your 8 primary slot's not into bags.you could
getaway with 3 slots if you Rotated the Fish Rolls and FF5K into #3, but you
have to have the back up stat food's in slots higher than the none Stat
food.  This is the price you pay to cheat the system..  Er bend the system.
;-)

Good luck
