I too am in the beta, and while I agree with your friends 
assertion, that doesn't mean they won't release it. It doesn't
suck much ass in my opinion though. It is a fun game, yet buggy,
and too much of jumping through the same hoops over and over
again (see Everquest). The game has made me quit my mmorpg
playing altogether, for the time being.
