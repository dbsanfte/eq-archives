There is a post on the official site about what to do in your case to update 
your beta application. Check there first.

The offer is for existing EverQuest players and the qualifications 
include -- in addition to buying LoE before the end of 2003 -- maintaining 
an active EverQuest account from the date of your application. If all that 
checks out, email the address listed on the site and they should be able to 
get you set up.
