This computer is 30 g, 90 % full and I have a ton of junk on it, but
it still has enough room for me to install a hefty sized game or two.
My old computer was 4g, I had everquest and some stuff on it; the
thing I had to avoid was multiple hefty sized games, and movie files.
I think you should have room for news :)

As for netscape, I use netscape 3 for my mail. It's the only edition
that does what I want (aka have deferred delivery as default) without
a ton of bells and whistles. Ok, so it could line wrap better, and it
doesn't handle looooooooong mails well, but it serves its purpose :)
