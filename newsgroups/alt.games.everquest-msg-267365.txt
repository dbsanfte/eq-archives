Been knocking around Usenet since 1984.  Seen this argument, oh, maybe 
1000 times in its various incarnations.  Have never, ever, seen any 
difference whatsoever in understanding a top poster from a bottom 
poster.  Or middle posters.  Or any variant you like.  At least since 
readnews was upgraded in 1986.

Maybe you have more problems than I.

But hey, it wouldn't be Usenet if people didn't argue about trivial 
things that don't matter.  Carry on.
