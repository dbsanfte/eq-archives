Between cleric and enchanter, if you're looking to who will be more in
demand at the high end, go cleric.

More than two or three enchanters on a large raid is superfluous - they
don't stack well.  Clerics, on the other hand...

Neither class is what you could call a solo class, although enchanters
could probably do it better than clerics.  But charm solo can be very risky.
