As I said above, I'm not sure he'll actually despawn on his
own.  I've never been on a failed Ixiblat kill;  he's really
not that difficult a fight by the time most guilds can start
attempting him.

But I remember some cleric that had to go looking for help
after their turn-in because their guild couldn't kill him and
that took hours.  But my memory of that is flawed, at best.
It was more of a "we've been asked to help guild XXX kill
Ixiblat because they can't.  Grab a port and we'll help 'em
out."
