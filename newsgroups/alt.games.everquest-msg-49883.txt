Good advice, but remember erudites start with agility 70 or something. Get
that agility up to 75 before you even think about charisma or int, else you
will run slow.

Tough class/race to start off as though. I started as a druid, and in
retrospect, i think that was a great choice. High elf/felwithe would be
easier for a chanter.
