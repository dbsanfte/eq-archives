I'm sorry, but these just don't add up.
Celestial healing does about 750hps for 220 mana.
Complete Heal on a level 51 troll with Resolution/Symbol of Naltron
should heal about 2400hps assuming you hit it at 20% health.  Complete
heal takes 400 mana.

Are you telling me, in the time it takes for that warrior to lose
750hps, you can regen 220 mana but you can't regen an additional 180
mana in the time it takes him to lose another 1450hps?

Somewhere, something is very broken.
