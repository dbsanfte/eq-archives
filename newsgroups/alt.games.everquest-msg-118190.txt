I have a co-worker who was commenting on the graphics for the game
"Wolfenstein" so I decided to try the demo just to see (only need the demo
since I'm just wanting to walk around a bit and see the texture and lighting
effects and realism).  I downloaded it at
http://www.activision.com/games/wolfenstein/index.html and would have to say
I hope EQ2 is this good or even better.  If anyone has played this one or
any of the ones that use what they refer to as the "Quake3 game engine" then
I'll be pleased with EQ2 if it is like this or better.  Running around in
the first level reminded me of the screenshots of Befallen for EQ2.
    Can anyone confirm that this is the sort of graphics engine they're
using, if not better one?
