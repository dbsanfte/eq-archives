You know, I've seen that a few times now, as the next game nears
release.

But the funny thing is, as much as I believe you are right - they do
have the mistakes everyone else made to look on - no one seems to be
*learning* from them, not even people who *should* know better like
Raph. :-)

Every launch since AC1, with the partial exception of DAoC who at
least got the stability half right, has been terrible!

So that's not so much what I'm referring to when I mention their
inexperience. Inexperience leads to what happened in DAoC - haphazard
nerfing/balance, poor handling of the player population, changes made
without thinking the consequences through, bugs and exploits, things
like that.

Also note I didn't say "failure". I'm referring to quality, not
popularity.
