I get the feeling it is going to mirror the so-called "Bloody Kithicor"
event of 1999, which, quite literally, changed the game world forever and
altered the way people play it. If this event ends up to be half as
interesting as that entire tale, I'll be pleased.

I highly recommend you read at least the opening explanation of Bloody
Kithicor here, under "we are at war": http://www.1fol.cjb.net

It is fascinating stuff. It's also the kind of thing I have long wanted
Verant to keep on doing.
