Sure, but some classes get fun later, some are only fun in the
beginning. I hate much downtime and slow advancement ( call me
a PLer whatever). So I'm looking into a class with good soloing
punch and spells. Already tried a Necro and quite like it, but
I'd like to see something else now. Mage with the elementals was
kind of appealing.

: Or would you consider continuing to play a class that you hate?

Not really. But you can't tell from playing levels 1-5 or so ..
and 5+ already meant some time invested :)
