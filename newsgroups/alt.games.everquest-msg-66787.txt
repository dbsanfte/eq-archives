From what I've heard from rangers (obviously I can't test the spell myself
;) )  the difference is in the casting time.  Tangling Weeds is nearly instant
casting.  The ranger was waiting until the very end of combat to snare them
(helped with ducking snare related aggro) and having no problems with runners
getting even a few steps.
