Oooh.  Oooh.  Here's another couple:

=========stands on soapbox==========
1. Change the stupid naming rules.  For example, my character was named "Atchoo Blesyoo" up until she was in her mid-30's.  At which point,
the GM's took away her surname because "Atchoo Blesyoo forms a common phrase.  ...a dialogue, if you will."  This removed quite a bit of
actual enjoyment I took from the game because I continually got compliments on the name, and I LIKE COMPLIMENTS.  They could write the rules
so that vulgar names could be avoided, while allowing people to take some enjoyment in clever names.
=========steps off of soapbox=========

2. Procs and effects should occur nearer the levels (or closer to the levels) where a character might actually care.  For example, I got
some Elder Spiritist Vambs (effect: Drones of Doom).  This effect requires level 45.  By level 45, DoD will have been moved to the back of
Atchoo's spell book.  If it occured within, say, a couple of levels of when she first obtained the DoD spell, it would've been a useful
piece.  As it is, it provides a good way to annoy a MOB.
