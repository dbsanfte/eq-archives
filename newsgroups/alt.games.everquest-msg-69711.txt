It does, easily.

Grim is a pushover once you get ensnare on him. SoC gives you the time
you need if the first one fails. Everything else is unreliable enough
that he's going to be all over you if it doesnt work.

I killed him easily in my 30s, while on a new server with almost no
one higher level at the time. Just gotta know what spells are useful
in which situation. When ensnare is resisted, the fast casting SoC
goes off, then you've got what, fifteen or twenty seconds where you
can try another couple ensnares in relative safety. If THOSE are
resisted too... well then you're really unlucky but you're not hosed
until he kills you.
