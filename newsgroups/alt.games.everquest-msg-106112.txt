Like everyone is saying they have a chance to drop off any Sarnak caster in
several zones. Lake of Ill Omen, The Overthere. Burning Woods and Chardock. I
wear 2 that I got soloing the Sarnak ruins north of the Warslik Woods zone
between the mud hole with the Klok and the ocean. I was actually camping Zorash
for the rare nodrop boots for the Iksar Dreadscale armor quest. Before the boots
drop I had gotten 3 Earrings of station but I gave one away be shouting to the
zone before the corpse rotted. I had gotten several Sarnak ceremonial daggers,
Emblazoned tabards, ceremonial swords. Made 3 levels soloing there also. Easy to
do for a Shadow Knight fear kiting the casters.
