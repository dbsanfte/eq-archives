"I've petitioned this over and over..."

Definately a sign to me that this guy is starting to lose the plot. Someone
is exploiting a bug - sure /bug and /petition it, then move on. Who gives a
crap if some idiot gets 3 level before getting canned? Oh that's right - the
pissing contest crowd does....

Heh- I hope they all level to 60 in 3 days and get away with it, just to
really annoy the crap out of the dick watchers : )
