    In RL, if I see a gold watch I have to know something about watches to
tell what make it is. If it has a visible label, I need to know something
about watches to know if it's a knockoff or not. In EQ, I see the exact name
of whatever I'm looking at when inspecting - it doesn't matter if my chain
tunic looks the same as other chain tunics or not, you know exactly what it
is.

    In RL, if I'm wearing long underwear you can't tell. You certainly can't
tell what colour it is unless I'm giving you a plumber's preview or
something. In EQ, you can tell exactly what leggings a robe-wearing
character is wearing. Ditto for other items that might be hidden from view,
like rings on a gauntlet-wearing character.

    And in a brief inspection, they figure out the exact proper name for
every item I carry on my person short of my packs and their contents? No
matter whether they've EVER seen such a thing before, or whether it's a
brand-new GM artifact?

    In all the RP games I've ever played, people were introduced by what
they look like: "You see a tall, muscular man in a suit of chain mail, with
a flaming sword in his hand." Not "You see a level 47 paladin in Seb Scale
armour with a Soulfire." I can see why they have inspections implemented,
but I cannot understand why some folks who would otherwise be very disposed
to roleplaying would defend the current implementation.
