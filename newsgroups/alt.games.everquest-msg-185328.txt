Five slots on buffs is too many, you are unlikely to be throwing these off
in combat so you dont need many - no mention of several good stacking
buffs (stat buffs, resist buffs and DS buffs), you dont hold a slot for
the combat useable buff of spikeshield - cycle the ong term buffs and hit
spikeshield and you pull a DS of 11 points.....

Your arrow spells overlap dont they? if you want two DDs get one that is
of a different source of damage (and so a different resist) if you can. No
DoT (OK flame lick is crap for damage but it is an AC debuff, minor though
it is). Never underestimate the ability to root something on top of the
snare and either run like hell, or heal by spell or bandage, or stand
pumping arrows into it.

You also do not leave yourself any slots to pick target specific spells.
