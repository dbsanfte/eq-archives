There are various theories on how the "secondary stat" helps
tradeskills.  One is that the stat provides a "booster" to
the higher of INT/WIS, the other is that it's an "alternate"
stat, so that what actually affects skill-ups is the
highest of INT/WIS/XXX, where "XXX" is the alternate stat
for a given tradeskill.

The jury's still out, but most evidence I've seen seems
to indicate that it's the latter case, and not the former.
If so, since your INT is already sky-high, you're not likely
to see any gain by trying to boost any other stat, since
it's unlikely you could get it to exceed your INT.

The higher of INT/WIS/XXX also makes sense in that it
would provide some relief to those classes that aren't
casters (and thus don't have high INT or WIS).  An Ogre
Warrior would thus still be able to be a decent blacksmith,
because STR is the "alternate" stat for smithing.  And
likewise for a Rogue, whose high DEX would help him
be a good fletcher.  If INT/WIS were the primary determination
of tradeskill skill gain, it would "discriminate" against
non-casters.
