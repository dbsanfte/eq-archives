Yes, EQ can be played through a dialup.  But it depends a LOT on
the quality of your modem, the telephone lines in your house, the
telephone lines between your house and the local phone company
switch, and the competency of the folks at your ISP.

A few years ago (before LDoN of course) I had dialup and could play
EQ just fine.  Downloading patches was slow, but I was generally
satisfied.  Then my local ISP got bought out by a regional ISP,
and things started going downhill.  If I'd try to make any sort of
sustained connection (like downloading a patch), the connection
would invariably crap out on me.  It got to the point where it
might literally take 20 or more tries to download an average-sized
patch.  Short connections (like accessing a web page) worked fine,
but my ability to play EQ was destroyed.

Eventually, I terminated my dialup service in disgust.  I can only
assume that someone at the new ISP didn't know what they were doing.

In your case, though, I don't see why LDoN would be causing connection
problems.  I suppose it's possible that instanced dungeons impose
a bit higher traffic load on the modem, and that extra bit pushes
your modem/phone line/isp over the edge.  Yes, I'm reaching.

I tend to look at modems and such as voodoo, honestly.  Sometimes
they work and sometimes they don't, and beyond testing and replacing
your modem and phone cord, there's not much you can really do to
fix it.  You could try moving to see if it's your house or neighborhood
phone lines, but that seems a bit extreme.
