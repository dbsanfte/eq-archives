Best soloers are necros, druids, and wizards (tough at low levels tho), and
maybe bards if youre dextrous.
The concept of a best class in a group is a bit meaningless, since youre
only doing your own part and are useless on your own.
In any case, theres a continual changing of rules, and if an class if
perceived as being more powerful it gets the nerf bat. Most classes have had
their good days and bad days. Monks (damage mitigation) and enchanters
(charm) are a couple of the recent casualties.
