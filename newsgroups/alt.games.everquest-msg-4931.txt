1. Is is considered bad EQ ettiquette to loot other peoples kills if they
leave them on the ground?  I've done this before and no one has ever said
anything but I don't want to be considered to be stealing someone else's
loot.

2. If I delete one of my characters, how long will I have to wait to be able
to use that name again on that same server?

3. Is there a way to see the actual level of your skills rather than just
the word descriptions (i.e., feeble, bad, etc)?

Thanks in advance for answers.
