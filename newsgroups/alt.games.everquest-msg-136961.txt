I would say it started with my implication that you are a homophobe,
but if you prefer explicit insults then my next message was the first
"attack", both dated July 28 IIRC.

Now, are you saying that
(a) its ok as long as the other guy started, or
(b) its ok as long as *you* feel like using it because you don't like
my arguments, or
(c) you're a good little lemming?

I'll just call you EQ2.   Or maybe EQ/2.

Other than in the general promotion of human rights it does not
directly affect anyone  but those in same-sex relationships.
Repetition does not prove your point.

Here's a tip: if you could show one way that the common-law
recognition of same-sex couples has at all directly affected "everyone
in this country", you *might* be able to extend that observation to
marriage.   Since a single example only illustrates a point, you would
then need to prove the general case somewhow, but at least you would
have a start at a substantive argument.   The fact that you, who seems
passionate on this issue, was unaware of any change in law re:
same-sex couples certaintly suggests that the effects on "everyone in
this country" are neglieable.

Because I DONT think its a bad thing.  The nature of democrary is to
foster leaders who are dependent on a popularity contest in order to
keep their job.  An appointed judge becomes free of many political
pressures (unlike an elected judge), and keeps office much longer than
any one session of government.  Hence we have judges willing to make
gutsy decisions, and politicians claiming they are somehow "unclear"
on an issue.

Since you voiced a concern about legislatures "shoving" laws "down our
throats", how can you oppose the courts' ability to compensate for
that?

Read that again, and think of your attitudes (and rants) in your
posts.  Then you'll understand why I just laughed.

Funny you should mention those.  I was wondering if my messages are
too complex for you to follow.  You keep ignoring certain points, like
the legal recognition of same-sex couples with common-law status.  (Do
you really think the step from common-law to married is so large?)
You claim some knowledge that great expense will result from same-sex
marriage, but you clearly didn't know that most of the benefits and
responsibilities of "couples" are already applied to same-sex couples
in Canada.  We disagree on Section 15, but you ignored my example of
its use *as I stated* by one court (and no, that example is not
unique).  You introduce financial and population percentage concerns,
then claim they are not issues for you.

My conclusion at this point is that you object to same-sex marriage
for reasons of your own (fair enough), but are unable to show any
reasoned argument or factual evidence to justify that objection,
beyond your inherent right to hold an opinion.

I find that there is no merit to the argument that the rights and
interests of heterosexuals would be affected by granting same-sex
couples the freedom to marry...
