232 wisdom with epic equipped.  But guess what, mana pool is rarely an
issue.  I learned long ago that a cleric with a 150 wisdom was just as
good as one with 255 wisdom and 500 extra mana, for almost all intents
and purposes.  You see, the key is not how much mana you have, but
what you do with it, and how quickly you get it back.  Mana pool only
matters if you are going after a tough mob thats doing damage faster
than your mana regen pool is capable of resupplying it.  Mana flow
is the real key, and the epic doens't do jack for mana flow.  I'd trade all
my wisdom gear in a heartbeat for FT15 and MP III, put either of those
on my epic and I'd stop thinking of it as such a joke.

Oh, and that 232 wisdom is off a 100 base wisdom.  If I was a high elf
cleric, I'd have been at 255 long long ago.  This being my second cleric,
I deliberately started with a lower wis in order to get better other stats
and potential for useful smithed armor (too bad that part never worked out),
because as I said, raw mana pool just isn't all that important.

Without some proof one way or the other, its hard to argue this one.  The
only numbers I've seen posted suggested that a cleric (not a well
equipped cleric, mind you, any cleric with MoR [common drop spell]
and YV and HoJ, both vendor buyables, and UHoF, trade in level
54 spell, far from hard to get ahold of) would outdamage the average
warrior (meaning one with actual equipment from sub endgame
sources)

Is this false?  I can't get real numbers out of anyone.

If you are basing your assumption on the fact that you find the
idea repulsive, then you'll have to find another patsy.  If on
the other hand, you've got some facts, well I DO keep asking
for them.

I can get SoS too.  And YV is 25% haste if thats not available.  And YV
boosts my attack up another 60 points or so.  And a chanter CAN
melee... but better not take any ripostes, where a cleric can laugh that
sort of thing off.

I keep saying this: Clerics sponge like rogues and rangers, and do melee
damage like warriors and paladins, they are not a replacement for either.
They do, however, have the best line of heals in the game and quite a few
other utility spells.

Monks, on the other hand, sponge like warriors and do melee damage like
rangers and rogues, AND have FD and the capability to keep themselves
adequately healed.

Any comments from a monk about cleric melee capabilities tend to make
me laugh, of COURSE I'm not a melee compared to "best plus best",
but I've been in plenty of groups where another warrior worth of damage
would be welcome, if I can do that without significantly reducing my healing
power, I just can't see where anyone can complain.

People have never complained about melee shaman, why is this?  Since they
have haste they are capable of doing credible but not astonishing damage
output.  Now that clerics are capable of the same, whats the problem
with them doing so?  Particularly since with YV, I'm really not losing much
in the way of mana regen while meleeing.

root nuke them to death, are you Certain my melee output is a joke?"
