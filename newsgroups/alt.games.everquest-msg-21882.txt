Yep -- the SBLive series is known to have stuttering problems
with W2K.  Don't know why Creative hasn't fixed it by now -- I'm
guessing there's something about the design of the hardware
itself that's totally braindead for a "real" operating system
that they didn't have to worry about in the 95/98/Me codebase.

If it's of any help, I just helped friend's SBLive/W2K problems
by disabling the "Sound acceleration" in the audio drivers.  Once
that was done, there aren't any issues at all (this also works
for other games like Star Trek: Armada.)

Don't let the SBLive issue dissuade you from using W2K, though.
It's the first Microsoft OS that I've truly been happy with due
to it's stability and reliability.

Mike
