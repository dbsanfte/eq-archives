You're only asked twice after every patch, neither time knocks you out of
the game.  You can configure ZA Pro (at least...don't know about freeware)
to always allow everquest.exe (and maybe some others) to access the internet
and after that it won't bother you again.

Win2k or WinXP eh?  Just download a freeware utility that quickly and easily
disables the Win key.  Go to www.downloads.com and do a search on Winkey
killer.  Then just unzip it and run it once to disable, run it again to
re-enable.  If you're afraid you'll forget to run it, just toss a shortcut
to it in your Start Up folder.

I'd recommend sticking the printer on the non-EQ computer...printing takes a
lot of resources anyway, even when you don't run into a problem.

Well, go to your wife's PC and do that...or read a book.  There's a hell of
a lot of stuff you can do while medding. :)

Try DAOC.  Still can't alt-tab...in fact, that's by FAR the easiest way to
exit the game considering the game EXITS when you hit those keys (and
considering the fact it takes so damned long to exit the "correct" way).
Less downtime.  Granted, there's no real reason to play unless you get into
PvP but STILL, it's less downtime.

LD due to what you mentioned is avoidable.  In over 2.5 years I can count on
one hand the number of times I've died due to unavoidable link deaths.

Are you a professional GAMING software developer?  They're a different
breed.  Sounds more likely to be a hardware problem anyway (something funky
about your particular card or mismatched memory perhaps?)...or OS.  Do you
get lock ups in either 98 or XP?
