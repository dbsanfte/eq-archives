I think, that mostly a little differentiation between 'Need to have'
and 'Nice to have' are called for.

Yes; I SoW my Shaman all the time, but I have a low lvl Beastlord
which works just fine without the SoW. Frankly I dont get the big deal
about the SoW - Yes its *very* nice to have, when running from a
battle gone bad ... but in my oppinion, you can learn to deal with
that too.

If people thinks its so important - well choose a class that gets that
damned spell ...

Good hunting all ... and take care out there :o)
