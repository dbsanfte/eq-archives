As far as I know there isn't anything "easy" like GLSs or HQ bear pelts.
It's said repeatedly that FOB is a very good newbie zone and it is
except for building your fortune. Except for bone chips and now maybe
spiderling and spider silks there are no "treasure" drops around Cabilis
for low level adventurers to sell to higher levels. Compare this with EC
and all the pelt drops and the willowisps.

My 23 iksar monk has earned about 300pp in his life staying exclusively
around Cabilis; he can't even spend any of it because there is no trade
economy there. My 19 wood elf ranger moved to Freeport at lvl 5 and had
300pp by about lvl 12.
