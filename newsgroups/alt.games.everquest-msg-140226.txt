No, it doesn't come down to a simple "apples apples" comparison.

CRT's are much more flexible when it comes to resoultion. If you run an LCD
screen outside it's native resolution, you get either a black band where
pixels should be, or you get interpolation, which looks like aliasing.

You have to judge your usage based on your needs, this is true, but they
aren't as similar as people would like to think, certainly not as
transparantly similar as amd vs. intel. cpus.
