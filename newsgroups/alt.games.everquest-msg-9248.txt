Well, there's other things for you to kill in the zone.  Best you can hope
for is to share the spawn, and that's never fun.

Nope, would have been a waste of time petitioning.  Fact is, if she had said
"I'm a tailor," that's a fantastic reason to be killing wisps.  You ARE
allowed to farm for stuff you need.  Level 60 necros ARE allowed to go into
Nektulos and wipe out the decayed skel population without apologizing.

Assuming everything you said was 100% correct this shaman was pretty
pathetic, but still not worth petitioning.

And Iron Knights aren't an impressive guild on Zeb...hell, I don't think
I've seen more than a couple of them.  But, nothing is stopping you from
looking for a guild officer and ask for help.  I know nothing about IK so I
don't know if they'd help or just laugh...but it doesn't hurt to ask.
