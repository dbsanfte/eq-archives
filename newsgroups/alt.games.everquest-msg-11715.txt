Nah, BB isn't too bad, though the critters aren't as plentiful as, say,
Freeport.  Not even as plentiful as Steamfont (if you can find the newbie
area :) ).  BUT, it's good enough because there's rarely much competition.

My first real character was a (well, still is, currently level 24 cleric
born on 4/1/99) dwarf.  What a pain in the ass I found Kaladim to be!!  ONE
vendor that I could find had food...and it cost 16 or 26c (I forget) each!
ACK!  That was after searching through the damned zone for 10 minutes.  To
buy DRINK I had to go outside and buy it from a danged Billy Idol wannabe.

After over 2 years I like Kaladim just fine...I know my way to the warrior,
cleric, and rogue guild and the bank...that's all ya need to know. :)  But
back then?  Nah, Kaladim isn't very user-friendly.
