Hi guys!

Is anyone else having a problem in getting EQ to log text to the character
files? It seems that my files haven't been updating in a week or two, and
though I've tried using the /log on command, my text still isn't being saved
in the files. Any ideas as to what might of happened?

Thanks, as always for any replies ..

Stevie.
