Paladin with Deepwater Helm (easily available) can do it with brief
(2 minute) downtime as long as the mobs root easily so that you can
heal in the middle of a fight when necessary.  This most definitely
_does_ include giants (we're talking light-blue to low dark-blue mobs
here), most of the mobs I've solo'd since 45 have been giants (Kunark,
Velious, and old-world).  Still get better xp in a decent group tho.
