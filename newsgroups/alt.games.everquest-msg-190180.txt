I dont mind spending the plat (I make enough selling junk in the bazaar =
etc).  I would still prefer to quest it, not getting it isnt gonna help =
me more than getting it :)=20

I will probably change priorites, ie more dex for soloing (bow =
kiting....or bow rooting...(why does no one bow root??), dunno bout much =
higher as im a newb.
Yup, you are right, we usually try and pick places we can fight single =
pulls (either he lulls indoors or I harmony outdoors), a warrior/cleric =
combo would probably be better in some situations, but we like exploring =
and I feel the ranger gives more versatility in this respect.

We are intending to join a guild at some point, so far we have had no =
need, and also didnt want to be applying for guilds before level 30, and =
really want to try and get as far as we possibly can without joining one =
(as we are newbies)
Alot of people I have seen who have joined guilds early, or even alot of =
the people in some guilds, seem to be quite inept players (and as I say, =
I am new). =20
