Rabotev, of course!

  With PoV groups all full when Ada logs on, and no time to just hang around
not gaining xp while waiting for a spot to open up, I decide to work on what
I can. Rab can solo the Dandolak these days, so I grind away, and soon he
hears the almost forgotten sound of levelling: DING! 56.
Time to buy new spells.

  Not many spells worth buying at this level. I do, however, plunk down 2k
for Wake of Karana. This is one of the more fun powers of druids: to control
a zonewide effect. Rain dosne't really hurt my ability to function all that
much, but it does slow down my frame rate somewhat, and some people are
really grateful to have it gone in a flash.

  I scribe it, buy a stack of opals, and head for East Commons to try it.
There is no rain, so I try to start some...but Karana dosen't hear.
Hmmmm...is this part of the gods aren't listening to mortals" thing, or does
Karana just not listen to Tunare worshippers?

  Later in Dulak, it rains, and someone ooc's "My kingdom for an opal to
stop the rain!" Well, I happen to still have some, so when I fhinish a quad
and have enough mana again, I mem, then cast...and lo and behold, the rain
stops. It had been going for some time, so it might have been due to
stop...but usually a natural stop is more gradual than this was. It cut off
rather quickly. So, maybe there is a chance the call will be ignored? Or are
the spell decriptions all wrong, it stops rain but can't start it?

  Whatever. Next few levels will be slow...but satisfying, as Rab gets some
really good stuff: Natureskin at 57, a semi-complete heal at 58. Plus the
ability ot join LDoNs with anyone.
