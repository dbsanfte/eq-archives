I understand shared accounts.  I'm a EULA violator myself.

I only starting using Usenet in 1995, you've probably been posting to
Usenet longer than I have, of course, back then Usenet access wasn't
very common at all.

My comment about 1991 was concerning my ID online, in 1991 I was a
GEnie user and a Delphi user and neither were Internet providers at
that time, only online service providers.  I don't think anyone could
"browse" back then.
I've been wrong before so correct me if I am. And using Usenet back
then was a Pine thing was it not?
