So TwoHead, anyone who points out that your rules are not rules is a
"rules lawyer"?

And someone who makes up his own rules and passes them off to the
newsgroup as if they have real validity is what?  A TwoHead?

In a post where someone was talking about pulling the mobs to guards, and
your reply twice said that "exploiting the guards was an actionable
offense," what point were you trying to make?  The only "exploitation" of
guards that can get one into trouble is training them
on another player. The original poster was certainly not doing that.
So why the double TwoHead warning?

Finally, when you post messages in the form:

<TwoHead warning/rule with no basis in fact>
<Other stuff>
<TwoHead warning/rule with no basis in fact>
<Don't tell me my warning/rule is wrong because if you do I'll call
you a rules lawyer>

don't expect the rest of us to oblige you by not pointing out that your
warning/rule has no basis in fact.
