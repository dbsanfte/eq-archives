Here's the simplest case to illustrate how a group can be much better.
Let's take two warriors vs a solo warrior.

Let:
	F = time for solo warrior to kill mob
	D = time to heal back damage taken during fight

Assume fighting in an area where there is a steady supply of mobs.

The solo warrior gets a kill every F+D.

How about a pair of warriors?  They are doing twice the damage to the
mob, so their fight takes F/2.  Since the fight only lasts half as long,
the mob only outputs half the damage.  Furthermore, that damage is
shared between the two warriors.  Since the warriors heal in parallel,
the healing time is only D/4.

So, the group gets a kill every F/2+D/4.  Ignoring the small grouping
bonus, they each get half the XP per kill they would get solo.  However,
they can kill two mobs in F+D/2.  So, each memeber of the duo gets in
F+D/2 the same XP the solo warrior gets in F+D.

If D is long compared to F, this can be very significant.  Suppose F is
2 minutes and D is 12 minutes.  A person in a group of 2 is then getting
in 8 minutes the XP the solo warrior takes 14 minutes to get.

How about 3 warriors?  F/3 + D/9 is how fast they are killing, but now
they are getting 1/3 the XP, so the group gets 3 kills in F+D/3,
compared to the solo player getting 1 kill for 3x the XP in F+D.  Group
wins even more.  With F of 2 and D of 12, group gets in 6 minutes the XP
the solo warrior gets in 14.

With 6, it is F+D/6 for the group, so each group member gets in 4
minutes the XP that the solo warrior gets 14.

I'll leave it to someone else to work things out for, say, Warrior and
Cleric, or other combinations, or situations where there are not steady
mobs, so someone has to go and pull.
