Yeah, what they said. : ) I have a level 33 Druid that until now had barely
seen over 200pp. But as soon as I hit 32 and 33, my bank account swelled to
well over 1k. On an average solo outing, I would bring in around 100pp in a
matter of less than an hour or two. In a group, I can imagine that the loot
is crazy high.
