No, but Bweekle the Gnome is capable of looking at what the X'Aridot
the Dark Elf passing by him on the street is wearing. That is the
"roleplay action" I was referring to and you know it DAMN well. You
know what? I'm done with you. This little tripe above just proved that
you're not worth arguing with. You'll twist an argument in insane
angles until you win, no matter who's right and who's wrong. Go play
your fucking bullshit elsewhere. I don't have time for it.

If you're not intentionally twisting the argument, then you're such an
idiot it's a wonder how you manage to operate the computer...
