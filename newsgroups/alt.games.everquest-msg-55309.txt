> The Overthere than staying at FM fort and you should be happy about people
> inviting you.

i would be happy for people to explain which "fort" they are referring
to as many zones contain forts. since i am in FM and looking for a
group there, when someone says "come to fort" i would assume they mean
the fort im standing in front of. lack of communication scares me when
i tank for someone cause if theyre gonna do that then maybe they might
fail to gimme an AFK message after ive said "2 Tumps incoming!" thus
letting me solo them while theyre taking a whiz or answering the door
or whatever. If people are going to invite someone from some other
zone they should say where they are like "Hey!...we got a group
camping the backdoor of the sarnak fort in LOIO if you wanna join us"
instead of "come to fort" or "BD". if people get their panties in a
bunch from someone typing plz instead of please then why not expect a
little info when recruiting more people.
