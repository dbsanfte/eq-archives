I dont mind giving sow, depending on how people ask for it. Someone asking politely
get sow, even the usual "Sow pls" get one. But people who think its my duty to
supply them with sow, or even worse, just do a /who DRUID and start begging without
even knowing where i am.
You mention Qeynos, so you probably know WK. Try to imagine every time you run
throught it 2-3 people beg you for sow, from doing a /who DRUID, so they do not
know where you are, and when you refuce to run to the other end of the zone to sow
them they get angry and start calling your names.
Its so bad that i now at level 34 have been forced to go /roleplay (want people to
see my guild tag, /anon hide it), because i get between 1-5 begs for
sow/buffs/ports/money/items in each zone i go through.
