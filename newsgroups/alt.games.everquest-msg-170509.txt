> Red    - 3 levels higher than you

Just to clarify: RED is at LEAST 3 levels higher than you, but can be much,
much higher.  So unless you know the level of the MOB, and know that it is
only a few levels higher than you, you should run quickly anytime you see a
red con MOB that doesn't like you.

Also, when you con a MOB, you will see a message that says "X regards you
amiably" "X scowls ready to attack" "X looks at you indifferently"  This
will let you know if a MOB will attack you or not. Even MOBS of much higher
level will not bother you if they con indifferent, amiable, warmly etc...
Watch out for the ones that are ready to attack.
