At the lower levels this might be fine but have you every tried to
bandage up 7500 hit points? LOL even if you had the gauze press
that is a ton of bandages to go thru.

That all depends on what level they'd be fighting at. No way 6 melee
could solo well against PoP mobs anyway, they hit too hard too fast.
But against whimpy old-world or kunark mobs it would work, barely.
A warrior starting at 50% would get Low- health agro quick, and if
they can bandage to 100% it would still take a lot of time between
pulls. Compared to an all caster group which could pull almost non-stop.

I think it would be way too frustratingly slow for many people to
put up with it for long.
