As someone else says you have a higher chance of getting hit by lightning
or even winning the lottery. No one is really getting anthrax randomly
mailed to them. It was mailed to a few people known to be at media
places. No one is going to target Joe smoe at his home address that they
don't even know. 

Besides, now that you know about it the instant you started having
problems you'd see a doctor, contact the center for disease control, etc.
The only reason why the one or two people died was because they just
figured they were sick at first for too long, then it was too late.
