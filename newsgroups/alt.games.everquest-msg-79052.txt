Ok, here's the scenerio that has made me glad I have added HIDE to my
Spellbook/medding key... (hiding when I med):
Sitting down medding...
out of noplace...
Hail, Jarrek.
*Sigh*
I already know what they want... I just stand, SoW, Nod and re-med.  I'm not
even nice about it anymore.  I've never received a donation for it and
rarely more than a /thank.  Would it kill them to /salute? /bow?  You know
what? From now on, no SoW unless they /grovel before me.  *hysterical evil
laughter*
