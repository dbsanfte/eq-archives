I should have read a little more in depth.  Thanks for pointing that out - I
missed it.

From what you're saying, I can't imagine -why- someone would want this on
their PC.  If you have no control, then what's the use, except as an
intrusion point from outside sources?  Unless, of course, you can shutdown
any pushes from elsewhere and you totally control what goes in your xSides
space.  That would undermine their reason for having the whole xSides
running, so I would venture a guess that you won't have total control.

You'll probably get s cute little window popping up in there each day "Do
you want this cute little Widget?  It has a great calendar, blah blah
blah..."  The people who this software is aimed at will click [ OK ] and
there's intrusion #1.  It won't stop from there.

Maybe some IPChain rules can block this kind of stuff  =)  Then again, why
have this software if you're running IPMasquing from a linux box?

What browser are you running?  OS?

I can't imagine NOT having this setup.  I'd be in deep crap without it - my
wife would be kicking me off of EQ to read her e-mail or browse constantly.
That is just -unacceptable-! *snort*

Now, if I could just get my MD 7.2 box to boot correctly, I'd be much
happier.  The sucker forgot how to boot from the HDD ( /dev/hda5 ) and now I
load the kernel from a floppy, which then proceeds to boot from the HDD
after the kernel is loaded.  I'm glad I rarely shut the box down - the
kittens, on the other hand...

Thanks for reading the whole article and pointing that info out.  I think
I'll go back and read it all, now.
