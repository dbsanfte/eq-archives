These are handy macros, but they don't do what he was
asking for.

I don't think there are any macro commands that do, unfortunately.

Targetting for 2/3rds of us most often consists of using the /assist button.

Pullers have to actually use point and click to select their
targets, while if the main tank is seperate he can use /assist
for most of his target select needs...right up till that priority
target rears its ugly head and he needs to switch.

If you are on crowd control duty, though, you want precisely
-not- to target the mob the main is on.  Worse, in a multiple
overpull, you want to target each and every mob out there
-but- the one the main is on.

While you can get some limited use out of the f8 key to target
the closest mob quickly, mainly this means point and click.
Worse, since there's an ongoing melee, it means manuevering
around like mad to get a clear angle on each mob.

One helpful hint: when that massive pull comes in, the main
should back up a bit between mez's, so that the mez'd mobs
stand seperate, while the unmezed ones advance.  If they
are all in a cluster, you just have to keep clicking on em
randomly till one pops up that hasn't been damaged.  Or
pop the cluster with AOE mez, that's what its for, after all.

Another good targetting plan for crowd control is.../assist.
Not on the main tank, on the nuker/healer that got aggro'd
unintentionally.  This requires that the target clear his target
registery so his assailant becomes his target, but it sure saves
a lot of running around trying to get a good angle.  It also
assumes the target has the good sense not to hit back with
a mez coming.

Be aware of your group and what its doing; your plan to
have them switch to the unmezable mob won't work so
well if you have DOTs or pets on the first target... DOTs
are impossible, pets merely very difficult to get clear.
This is one advantage to root parking instead of mezing,
root doesn't care about DOTs.  Pets are a different issue,
yes they make mobs unmezable... but they are often a parking
method on their own.

If there is a macro command to switch to the next mob that
isn't the main target of your group and hasn't already been
mezzed, I'd like to hear about it... but I really don't think there
is anything of the sort.
