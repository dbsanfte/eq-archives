I think this is more to do with a new expansion, ppl not getting on, systems
not compatible etc as well as those on line wanting to get into the new zone
and look around, servers are likely emptier than normal and those on are off
doing other things.

The best place to have auctions would be NFP due to easy access to a bank.
Most ppl have good faction with the Paladins there (even evil characters as
they normally kill the Guards in EC and WC) but EC is the Bazaar zone on
most servers (including mine) I'd bet it picks up again after the weekend.
