Then again, it could be argued that art is its own reward. If the 
"artist" wouldn't do it for free, then it's not art, but soulless 
corporate pap.

Yes and no... There is a difference between "losing" and "not making". 
If I were to make a copy of a mediocre CD which I would never have 
bought, neither the artist nor the record company have lost any money.

On the other hand, I've been known to buy multiple instances of an album 
I really like, for no other purpose than to give more of my money to the 
artist and the record company that supports them.

I think that the only reasonable solution is one in which the artists 
distribute their work for free, and people freely donate to them as they 
see fit. Cut out the useless corporate middleman.
