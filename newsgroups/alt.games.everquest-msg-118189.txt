Great response Jekke.

I hate when people dismiss characters for not taking the slow route to
L60 totally untwinked and clueless, without knowing the circumstances.
50 days to L60 shows a certain degree of determination and focus, but
certainly not the same as having a druid/shaman shadow for 60 levels and
zero in all secondary skills. You got there on your own merits by the
sound of it, and shouldn't be denigrated for it.


Back to the main topic of the thread:

200+ days played. Started Demo as first char out of the box without much
of a clue. Twinked? Well, I was ecstatic when I got my PGT in my low
20s, a guildie passed me a GZ at about L27 and I thought I was a god,
still in some crafted in late 40s, but eventually getting dual Yaks held
my place in the ubers.
