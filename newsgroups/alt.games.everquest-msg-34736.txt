If I had been the developer, I'd have made it so each epic's end test, be it
battle or otherwise, had to be soloed by the character going for the epic.
It wouldn't be that hard to have some kind of mystic portal that only admits
a member of the appropriate class who hasn't got an epic yet.  Then you
could tailor class-specific problems to each epic, tweaking the design ever
so carefully to ensure that winning is the hardest thing you've done to date
but just barely possible.  That would make it much more personal and, IMHO,
much more rewarding.  I'm much more of a solo player by inclination, though,
so that probably has something to do with it.
