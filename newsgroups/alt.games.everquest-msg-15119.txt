Most likely, not "only". Hundreds of people who were never in beta love to
trot out how they were in beta since the beginning, and for this reason the
utter nonsense they are spouting is somehow less stupid. I don't believe
anyone who says they were in beta anymore.

A joke because it is so easy to obtain. Theres no accomplishment in level
40.

No, 50 isn't all that great either. Having an impressive level doesn't
start until 55.

No room for debate here...if your friends are twits, that is their own
fault.
