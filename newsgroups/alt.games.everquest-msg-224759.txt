    This wasn't the first attempt to kill him. Others had seen the regen/HPs
he had previously.

    It was likely a mistake, like so much of what's in EQ. Or when he was
switched over to being immune to all resistable spells, some dev lowered his
regen and HPs at the same time to "balance" it. The devs never imagined 150+
people with manaburners/lifeburners would be willing to eat 20+ deaths each
to kill it, especially seeing as how most servers had already woken the
Sleeper when the change was done.
