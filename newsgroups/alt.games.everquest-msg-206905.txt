Anyone that got banned for that would have to be an idiot.  I mean,
seriously, "/tell GM I was about to die, is it a crime to zone out?  Are you
telling me I have to remain in the zone and die, that I don't have the
option to zone out?"
followed by "/tell GM And I still wanted to be in that zone, is it a crime
to zone in?  Are you telling me that if I run from a mob I am in essence
banned from that zone?"
and if you're feeling ballsy "/tell GM Could you please go find someone
doing something a touch worse than *ZONING* to bother?"
