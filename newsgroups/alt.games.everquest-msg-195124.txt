I just read this and it jogged my memory, I meant to do a follow up post to
a thread I did a month or so ago regarding my Jboots and how I stumbled into
the AC in 15minutes in south ro to get the ring.  A few people said that it
was just uncanny luck so I actually went back again last week to kill some
time and sure enough, old ugly AC was up within 45min (granted, I was
starting to lose faith after 30min) but there he was after killing 3 cycles
of 'sand mummy'  a terrorantule spawned after first Sand mummy, some named
sand giant the 2nd time, and 3rd was AC.

I don't know, it sure seems fairly easy IMHO to spawn the guy.  One day I
will try it a 3rd time and see if I can do it in under an hour.  The great
thing is, this zone is almost always empty.
