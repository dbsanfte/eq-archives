For once, I'm with the crowd, reroll the character.  Wis is the single least
important stat for a wizard; skill learning checks are all based on your best of
wis or int, wis doesn't help you with any of your rolls, nothing.  If you'd put
those points into dex or stamina or strenght or... well anything but wisdom, I'd
have argued that it might be fun to play... but Wis is just a sink, total waste
of your potential.
