Check out the quest for getting into Crypt of Decay for a relatively
quick way to get flagged for a Tier 2 zone. I can't find the URL atm
but the safehouse has a good thread on the placeholders and mobs that
you need. About a month ago, they upped the spawn rates so now you
have 4 PH spawning every 20 minutes instead of just one. Combine that
with the fact that you can now flag a group with one turnin instead of
just one person and it's pretty easy to get in now. It's easier with a
tracker but you could probably do the quest solo once you figure out
the pathing. Running 2 groups of 4 people in different parts of the
zone, took us about 5 hours to get all 4 pieces along with one or two
duplicates. 

Don't expect it to be an easy zone (compared to PoV/S),lots of narrow
corridors with mobs in little alcoves that are hard to see, many
roamers and occasional random unslowable mobs that hit for over 700
(Greater Corrupted Pussling and Elite Death Knights). ... and all
that's just pulling to zone in <g>. We haven't had the cojones yet to
go in much past that.
