It just occurred to me, why dont mobs have archers who use arrows on
you?
Imagine a pack of goblin archer who pelt you with arrows but are
pretty weak
when you run up and whack them with an axe. This would make the game a
little
more strategic, at least is places where there arent caster mobs.

Also, maybe they could raise monks ability to block and dodge but
lower the
AC. That would be more realistic. I used to play a pen and paper game
similar to
D&D where you had both a "target class" (how easy are you to hit) and
an "armor class" (if you get hit, how easy is it to damage you) In
regular D&D something like a small bat and a rock golem would have the
same AC. Having 2 different stats made more sense. It would be hard to
hit the bat but once you did you ended up doing a lot of damage. Easy
to hit the rock golem but often your weapon damage wouldnt exceed the
armor defense. We called that a *ptink* So it would make sense that
the higher the agility of the monk makes him harder to hit, but once
you do it does more damage. That same high agility gives him the
ability to jump and duck unlike someone in field plate armor.

Then again this isnt verants vision (i.e. Porting, nuking, sowing,
begging, oocing)/troll off
