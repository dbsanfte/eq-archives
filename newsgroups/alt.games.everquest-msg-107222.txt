Keep in mind that you get more experience in any dungeon than you do
outside.  The closest dungeon that is about your level is Crushbone (off of
Greater Faydark).  Estate of Unrest will be good in a few levels.  Since you
mention Freeport, Befallen is probably a good place to hunt.  Remember to
bind yourself nearby though 'cause it's also a great place to die. :)

Raw silk is the best you can do until you find something better off of
critters.  Don't buy robes from NPCs, they just cost WAY too much.  All
wizards have to worry about until high levels is mana and INT items.  Just
keep upgrading your armor as you come across stuff that give you these
things.

We're a few months away, but also keep your eye out for armor that has high
AC, hitpoints and resists (poison, disease, fire, cold, magic) because
you're going to need them soon enough.  I spent most of my younger years
ignoring that and at level 57 I'm only now starting to get a decent resist
kit set up.

If you got those from www.allakhazam.com or http://eq.castersrealm.com I
can't really help you.  I CAN tell you that wizards are one of the classes
that highly rely on grouping (all classes can solo, but some are better than
others) so if you're not into grouping I'd suggest a druid, mage, or necro
alt for when you can't find groups with the wizard.
