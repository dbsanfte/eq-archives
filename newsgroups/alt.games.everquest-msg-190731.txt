.... I wasn't.  I am now (at least until I see if Gravity is a good platform
for me).  It actually addresses one of my pet peeves about OE - the
piss-poor quoting algorithm.  I usually just tack things back together if
it's small words that get dropped.  I figure it's better to have every other
line misquoted than the continuous
lines
of
one
word
breaks.
(as OE snaps off each word at the end of the line for each successive level
of quotation).

Still, I hope the color thing can be disabled.  It's always kinda irritated
me when Dejagoogle did it.

Currently using OE 6 on XP, and it still bites.

It's great for getting the newest fansubbed episode of Raimurio Sekitan, or
snagging a few Hamasaki Ayumi songs, but I don't use it for communication.
