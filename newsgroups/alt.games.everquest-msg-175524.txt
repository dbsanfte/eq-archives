No. A select minority that were both clueless about the process of
software development and unwilling to let such cluelessness keep them
from posing as an authority on the subject would grumble about it.
Then, we would tell them to shut the fuck up.

Changes to EQ go through two or three layers on testing before going
live. First, they are tested on internal testing servers which, as
best as I can tell, tend to have less than 100 active players who play
selectively for the purpose of testing. Then, changes are vetted to
the public test server. At non-patch peak, test can have as few as 300
people on it and has an active population of probably less than 1,000
players.

If the content is large, there's a third stage where players on live
servers are selected to beta test the content before it goes live. We
don't have any reliable numbers to work from, but I consider it safe
to say that the number of people involved in this content at any given
time is significantly less than play on test.

If we are super-optimistic in our estimates, maybe 1,500 people vet
new content before it goes live with 300 to 350 concurrent users
maximum. That means that certain things are going to slip through the
cracks:

(1) Economic effects of change - Public Test has no normal economy to
speak of. I have never seen more than 60 vendors in the bazaar ever on
that server. Unlike production server economies, plenty of basic gear
is simply unavailable at any price.

(2) Glitches with specific MObs or zones - There was a brief bug a
while back wherein the MObs in Crushbone were each dropping 9999 plat
9999 gold 9999 silver 9999 copper. Even if this code went live on test
for a week in advance, it's entirely possible that no one went to
Crushbone on test that week or few enough people went that no one
reported the bug.

(3) Problems with high-end content, particularly time sinks - Do you
know how many bugs people on test have caught in Vex Thal? None.
Nobody's doing Vex Thal. Nobody's farming Sleeper's. On test,
"high-end content" still means NToV, Glyphed/Cursed and King Tormax.

Even if Verant tested Vex Thal extensively in-house, I guarantee that
they didn't make all of their testers go through the mind-numbing key
quest. When they beta'd out Plane of Time, I guarantee that they
didn't make the testers spend months progressing through the lesser
planes.

If SOE *did* do the sort of testing required to catch all of these
errors before they go live, we'd never see the damned content. Fixes
would never be put in. Content would never be added. We'd all still be
crowded into Soulsek B, Guk, and Permafrost, eternally level 50.

Or, if changes were made, the game would cost a hundred dollars a
month in order to support the thousands of full-time playtesters that
would be needed to get it out in a timely fashion.

In a complex system like EverQuest where the cost of entry is
extremely low compared to any other similarly complex product and
updates need to be made frequently, the *only* way to do quality
control is the way SOE does it: write it, test it as thoroughly as you
can internally, vet it to a subset of the public, take it live, then
fix what's broken.

If someone familiar with the software process can tell me how to
support an environment like EverQuest better without stretching out
the patching process or making the game prohibitively expensive, I'd
sure like to see it.
