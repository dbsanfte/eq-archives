I won't deny that in many cases I was "as good as" a knight tank, and
preferable in many cases because I could tank almost on a par with knights,
but still do real damage.

Knights are fucked, imho.  They are where the problem lies, where the
problem always was.

Tanking is about a) holding agro as much as b) living through the attacks,
and knights a) beat me by soooooooo much in either generating or retaining
agro, and b) were "a bit" better (mainly because of  more HP/AC)

The problem was the trade off with a knights better tankability was too
small versus the DPS gain of my extra damage (I was maybe 0.8 behind for
tanking, but 1.5 ahead for damage)

Sure I've tanked big stuff, but I think thats more because I raid daily, and
have pretty nice gear.

I didn't tank Tormax, CT, AL etc because I was a monk, I tanked him because
I had over xxx HP (obviously very different since PoP.. I had <5k HP when i
tanked Tormy and AL, now its >7k HP and LR 5)

A guildie rogue was/is in a similar position.. which is why I am so adamant
the problem wasn't with monks but with knights (and the whole AC system).
He is a rogue, but a full-time cleric botter.

He tanks all his groups, from Velk to DN to CT, to PoV, HoH, tactics and
CoD.  He's tanked HoT just like me, he's tanked CT, ST Ancients, Doze, Yeli,
and so on.

Why were monks over powered, when rogues were not?  He was within 0.2 of my
tankability based on actual events (aka who tanked what) whilst his damage
was still 1+ ahead of mine

No clerics, wizards or chanters in AE groups-early SoL?

Monks had a good zone to exp in, Velks (once I finally got my epic at 60, I
could solo reasonably well there) now I dunno about your server, but on
Prexus Velks was FULL of people.  A handfull of monks running around, druids
soloing at the bottom, and groups in every camp spot.

The mobs were pretty easy for DBlue, but hey I could go 40 mins without
finding a damn mob to kill.

My guilds AA count (remained the same pretty much from early SoL to now) was
and is:
Chanter (like 400+)
SK (400+)
Rogue (200+)
Cleric (170+)
Monk (170+)
Cleric (150+)
Warrior (150+)
Monk  (150+

Untwinked (and I mean really untwinked, my first haste item was an FBSS at
49.. wearing a CSS and wielding batons into the 50's+) I couldn't solo or
tank shit.  Green mobs in DL could own me.

The only stuff I ever solod in DL was the yetis in the cave (sweet spot,
those mobs were over cons and safe from adds).  I couldn't tank BW, SF,
Karnors, Seb etc etc, even with a cleric.

Im sure untwinked people have MUCH better gear than I did (fbss was over
10k, fungi was unbuyable, I had 1k.. heck there wasn't even spider fur
pieces like now, thats some badass cheap armour) and so do much better than
I did versus the same mobs.. but they thats old hat content now.

My monk + a real cleric couldn't duo the BW undead without a necro (fear
kite)
I took my SK to BW at mid 30's, and using a (bot) cleric, I tanked anything,
from undead to named giants (gorgul, pretty big miscon)

Thats so not overpowered its not even funny.

Well I don't rate overpowering (or unbalanced) solely on the direct increase
it adds to exp

You can sneak through the entire of Vexthal.  You can sneak round the entire
nToV, through all of old world, Luclin, and 99% of PoP.   Risk free.

I don't know what AA opened up more "options" and content-skipping, spoilers
and the like, than shroud.
