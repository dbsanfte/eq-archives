Coterie General Cape (anywhere from 250 to 500 pp in the bazaar).  Why you
ask?  40 HP.  Always beef up the HP as a Necro (DEs need it more than any
other except maybe Erudite).

Adamantite Band for about 250pp (75 HP)

Platinum Fire Wedding rings between 200 to 275pp ea (55 HP)

Lizard Skin Sash about 200pp (10 HP/25 Mana)

Shardtooth's Flayed Skin (35 HP/35 Mana) (You can sell the advisor Robe and
get Int elsewhere such as Gatorscale sleeves)



You trade HP for Mana all the time, so it works better to add to HPs than to
add to Int.
