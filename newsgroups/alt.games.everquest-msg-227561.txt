: We have platinum on Tarew Marr, Luclin, Cazic, 7th
: Hammer, Ayonae Ro, Vazelle, Maelin, Firiona, and stromm with many
: kinds of items also avail on these servers for competitive prices.

Lot's of plat and gear on 9 different servers, husband and wife team, no
others doing this for them, it's an on-the-side way of getting money.  What
part of all that stikes anyone as a lie?  Scammers need to learn that most
of us know when they are trying to bs us.  The problem is the small
percentage that acually fall for these scams.

I expect that there will be a response or two stating, "They are legit!  I
know.  I've used them dozens of times."  Yeah, right.  And I am the rightful
heir to the throne of England, Scotland and Wales.
