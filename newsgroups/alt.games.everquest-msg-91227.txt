Granted, it *could* be done. And as for taking a naked character just to
make the run I'd have no problem trying it. Unfortunately, the huge
downside to this trip is that there is no bank I could use anywhere near
E.Commons. That means that I would have to carry my life savings with
me. It only takes one small "slip-up" where a moment of server lag makes
that Giant in FM "appear" to be down the hill when actually he's right
in your path, and ... "oops". Life savings gone. Plus (again, due to the
lack of banking) even if I made it safely to EC and negotiated a good
purchase, I'd lose the ability to duel/suicide for the "poor man's port"
back to FoB, and would have to make the trip safely in revers, *again*
with the equivalent of my life savings at risk.

Given all that, I think I'll take my chances on GFey. It may only have
20% of the commerce on Innoruuk, but it's not like I'm looking for
anything rare, or even specific. Just a few low end decent weapons to
see me into my mid levels. Plus, the brief access to the bazaar and the
cheap ten slot bank containers there would make the trip worth while
anyway. Besides, the GFey spires is a common destination for many
players, and you could get lucky finding somebody coming back from a
raid with a bunch of "vendor trash" on them, etc. that could set me
right up.
