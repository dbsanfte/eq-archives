I have gotten kind of burnt out playing my monk in the post 50 levels. The
exp is so slow and the impossibility of soloing has really taken a lot of
the fun out of it for me. When I do find the time to play anymore, it's
usually on of my alts. But last night in Maidens Eye, I had a really amazing
fight.
    It was me, a 53 monk, 2 paly's both close to my level, a 60 cleric, a 60
chanter and a 57 mage. We had been pulling consistently the four armed
bastards that hang out in the big building in the center with the occasional
Toilers or other wanderers joining in the fun. It was almost too easy, and
then right after starting a fight with two of the 4 arm things, we got 3
adds at one time and as luck would have it, that's when the God's of EQ
decided to kick the chanter Link Dead. So now we are facing the original two
4 armed thingies, a ravenous beast, a toiler, and a vampire bat. The fight
was touch and go for a long time and I said at one point every one zone,
I'll try to keep their attention for a few seconds. I didn't use mend till
things seemed really desperate, but the fight went on long enough that mend
recycled and I was able to use it a second time. At one point one of the
paly's used LOH on me and saved my ass. We managed to keep the chanter alive
while he was ld and he logged back on just as we were finishing the fight.
    If I could have that much fun every night with my monk, I'd play him a
lot more often. Man that was fun.
