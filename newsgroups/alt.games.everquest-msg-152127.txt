I'm assuming you've tried & failed.  I know there's some way to do it with
an OEM OS, though for the life of me I forget where I saw the info, sorry.

Push comes to shove, if you can't install it with the activation number you
have, find a friend with a non-OEM version and ask them for theirs.  But it
really should install ok with what you have.
