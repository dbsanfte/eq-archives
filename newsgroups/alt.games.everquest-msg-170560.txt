It wasn't a permanent loss of STR, just... you'd get into the middle of 
a fight, and all of a sudden you'd start losing it - I noticed when I 
started becoming encumbered in the middle of every fight.  I knew I had 
plenty of STA, and my bags were fairly empty, so... yeah, very weird.  
Someone mentioned that it was linked to losing health, but I didn't stay 
long enough after to watch for that.
