All I can tell you is what I did--at the end of my first EQ2 month I 
canceled my sub.

At the end of my first WoW month I changed from one month recurring billing 
to quarterly recurring billing.

Were there no WoW for comparison, I'd most likely still be (mostly) happily 
playing EQ2.  But there is and I ain't.

If you need to email, then chainbreaker (naturally) at comcast dot
