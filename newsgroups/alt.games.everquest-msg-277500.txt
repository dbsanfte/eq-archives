I don't know if the rules have changed within the past couple of years, but 
I do know that I've had trouble in the past using the same name twice, but 
not always. It seemed that I stood a greater chance of re-using the name of 
one of my deleted characters if the new character was of the same race. I 
had at least one situation where I was unable to use a deleted character's 
name for one of a different race.

Therefore, I, myself, would be careful of how I created any temporary 
characters just to check for name availability.
