You can't improve your faction more than 2000 points, so 2000*4 = 8000
bone chips max. You've got 5000 more bone chip (1250 stacks!) to turn in
to max out faction. I would have thought you'd have gone from "scowling"
to "glaring" so far, at least, although those are both merely different
levels of KOS.

I've heard that there are a few other quests you can do once you get to
non-KOS that give you more than the +1 faction point adjustment that the
bone chip quest does. Turning in Explorer Knives, Goblin Watcher Torches,
and Maruader Snout Rings might be worth looking into.

It took my Dark Elf Shadowknight 250 goblin/sarnak/renegade kills to go
from Scowling to Glaring, and 250 more for Glaring to Apprehensive with
the Troopers. Cabilis faction farming is the pits, but at least it's doable.
Looks like my Troll Beastlord will get to amiable with all of Cabilis
*long* before he gets to amiable with Ogre Beastlords, even though he
doesn't start off KOS to Ogres.

The Cabilis Shaman Guild is notoriously hostile to non-Iksar,
non-Evil-Worshippers.  (Crusader Quarg is actually on Shaman faction, not
Crusader faction.)  "They say" that Bertoxx/Cazic/Innoruuk worshippers can
eventually become non-KOS.  Agnostics and Good-Worshippers will always be
KOS to them.  Rallos Zek is one of those borderline cases I'm not sure
about.
