My wizard is currently 47 wearing TBoots and a Dragoon Dirk.
Since level 6.

Money spent on caster gear sometimes seems useless to me, unless
of course you want to quad-kite all day.  But she has no trouble

And, she can port to the planes now.  It's funny when folks see
her in EC translocating folks and they ask her where she died.
