I use Comcast, a Linksys router and have 3-4 machines running at any given
time, but only run one session of EQ... Never had a problem with it
connecting... You've intrigued me enough to want to get a buddy over to try
both of them though... At a guess, I'm thinking packets are being sent to
the router from the EQ server, which then doesnt know which machine they
should be sent to and ends up sending them to the wrong machine, causing a
conflict and crashing the game...

This is speculation on my part, and is NOT intended as the be-all end-all
answer to why the problem happens....
