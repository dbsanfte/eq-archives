Frogloks were the next vote winners after Kerrans, I think.
Pixies were around the same number of votes. If you think about it
though, pixies would be even harder to fairly implement. You'd have to
give them perm levitate or something which is kind of  a huge
advantage. They are also quite small, which would make all the work of
texturing them and such seem kind of a waste when its hard to make
them out.
