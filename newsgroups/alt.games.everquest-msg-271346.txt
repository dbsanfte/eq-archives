Yeah, you either need a rogue, (maybe a bard, but I don't think 
lockpicking is high enough for it), or you need to go deep into The Hole, 
and kill a shaman epic mob for the key.  You might need a shaman to 
respawn him with the key though, not sure off hand...

It used to be that you could agro duel someone with, whatever that spell 
is that tosses you in the air, to get tossed up top, I had heard it's 
been nerfed.  You can also get agro from a mob inside, and get him to 
open the door for you, or at least it used to work.  Of course, then 
there is the minor issue of getting up the elevator also, I am thinking 
that is keyed too, but I could be wrong.
