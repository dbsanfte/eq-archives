There are definitely going to be some strange times ahead for the cleric =
class.  Who knows the outcome for sure until they go live.  I read =
through your post, and while I'd like a few more spells etc. to add to =
my book, I would not want a DoT or any more offensive spells.  This is =
not the role of our class, we are not a hybrid and I for one would not =
want to waste mana on these spells during combat when I could squeeze =
out one more Cel Heal or Com Heal.

There has been quite a lot of debate on this topic, some feel that =
clerics are getting the shaft, some are indifferent... either way, I =
don't think that there are any people that feel this is 'balancing' to =
the cleric class.
