The Roman Legions never came up against the longbow to my knowledge, but the
Parthians definately did the "27 arrows in their chest" trick with their
horse archers. Reports observed Roman Legionares with their sheilds nailed
to their sheild arm by multiple arrows whilst others unable to move as they
were literally nailed to the ground also. Horse archers used short bows
(usually of intricate laminate construction) and fire a very quick
projectile with a low trajectory, but have neither the range or stopping
power of a long bow.

Unlike Hollywood where everyone dies politely dies/collapses quickly with a
single gunshot/punch/sword thrust, a lot of classical and medievil accounts
detail soldiers fighting on with appalling injuries. Of course, blood loss
and infection take their toll and actual *survival* may be less common, but
actually taking someone out of a fight is a pretty difficult and gruesome
task.

Cheers
