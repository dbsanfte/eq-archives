Red herring argument, and the 3rd time someones said it.  8/

They have a revenue model in place to support updating old content: your 
subscription fees. If they deemed they needed another 50c or $1.00 per 
month to make revamping zones profitable they could easily have done so.

And most importantly they don't have to stop generating new profitable 
expansions. Its not like they had to choose between the two. They could 
have had their cake and eaten it too.

If your theory is simple greed it falls short. Had they been greedy 
enough they would have taken the opportunity to build 'profitable' zone 
revamps into the subscription fee and raise the price accordingly.

Some time ago they jacked the price up 23% from 9.95 to 12.95 in a fit 
of unmitigated raw greed. They could easily have made it 13.95 and 
generated enough revenue from that extra buck to *profitably* revamp a 
zone every month thereafter. In fact a breif analysis indicates that it 
would be *more* profitable than doing an expansion at that price!! Plus 
it would have been good PR at the time too, as the playerbase would have 
seen at least *some* return value on the jacked up price.
