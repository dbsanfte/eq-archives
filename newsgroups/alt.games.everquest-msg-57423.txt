I found this to be quite handy last night in a Hate raid... not
because I as a cleric could Heroic Bond other groups (every
group had at least one cleric, imagine that, in purple land) but
because I, as group six leader, could just

/tell (enchanter) G6 C2 fade

and we -all- got refreshed, without

/g (warrior) you are the weakest link
select (warrior)
disband
Invite enchanter
wait for group C2
disband enchanter
invite warrior

really, thats such an undertaking that it
usually doesn't happen, the chanter tended
to just individually C2 on request.  If
mana cost is anything like Heroic Bond,
though, group C2 is better if there are
at least 3 mana users in the group

I've also been in raids where all groups
were held at 5 members, so the group
buffers could more easily freshen up
everyone... thats a thing of the past too,
which means raids can consist of fewer
groups, and my group heals are more
effective, since my group now has one
more member.

Also, the buffs themselves are one fifth
more efficient, since the buffer isn't buffing
himself again and again, but rather six -other-
people.
