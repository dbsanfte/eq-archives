It needs a few corrections.  You describe the
"packet loss" indicators as, "the number of
information packets that are being received
by the world server".  Actually, it's the
*percentage* (not "number") of information packets
sent which were *NOT* received by the world server
(first number) or *NOT* received by your own 
computer (second number).

Also, I'm pretty sure that the "info uploaded"
figure is actually the "info downloaded" figure
instead (i.e., it's the *incoming* bytes/sec,
on average, not the outgoing as you say).
