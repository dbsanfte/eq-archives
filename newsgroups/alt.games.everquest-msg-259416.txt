And you were wrong - not about things greening out, but about
getting AA's at lower levels being faster.  I abhor misinformation,
and you were spreading it.

No, I was providing correct information, so that newer players
aren't mislead by your misinformation.

Oh, and you might want to look again.  Maybe someone needs to
hold your hand to show it to you:

http://eq.crgaming.com

Left hand side, third group of links with the header
"Popular Areas", 12th link in the group "Patch History".

Surely even someone who makes the absurd claim that
a 58 solo's XP faster than a 65 can group it isn't so
clueless as to claim that link isn't there.

But, just in case you are (which wouldn't surprise me)
that link leads here: http://eq.crgaming.com/patches.asp

Then, September 6th, 2002 you get:
http://eq.crgaming.com/archives.asp?Day=6&Month=9&Year=2002&ID=4751
&Action=View

At the bottom of that you click the "here" in "Click here for details"
and get : http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4751

There's the high con bonus.

Then, under June 11, 2003 you'll find:
http://eq.crgaming.com/archives.asp?Day=11&Month=6&Year=2003&ID=5134
&Action=View

Once again, click the "here" in "Click here for details" and you get:
http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=5134

That's the boost to the grouping bonus.

I note how you call me a troll, but the best you can do to support your
contention that a level 58 solos for XP faster than a 65 is "Walk
around".  Where are your numbers?  Where is the empirical evidence?  Logs?

Here's a few for you (The xp given per kill was established long ago
by folks using ShowEQ.  These numbers also tally with my observations)

The easiest DB mob a 58 can fight is level 43.  The easiest DB mob
a 65 can fight is level 50  (Con players at 58, you'll see that 43
is the lowest DB.  75% of your level rounded down.  The level 50 for
65's comes from the patch note above).

Level 43 mobs give 43*43*ZEM XP per kill to a solo player, or 
1849*ZEM.  

Level 50 mobs give 50*50*ZEM XP per kill to a solo player, or
2500*ZEM

So, ZEM's being equal, a level 50 mob gives 2500/1849 = 1.35,
or 35% more XP per kill.

This, in turn,implies the 58 has to kill 35% more 43's per hour than the 65
has to kill 50's in order to equal his xp rate.

Now, the question is -- can he do that?  Let's compare 2 
BL's (since we both have one).  One 65, the other 58.

First a nice chart: http://www.beastlords.org/warder/ward-info.php

My DPoC focused, buffed and equipped warder is level 61, has 
~6k hp, max hit of 79, 96% haste, +115 atk, +90 dex, a 155
proc and a minimum of 7% higher mitigation than any unfocused
warder.  He's fighting mobs that are 65% slowed and I can
heal him for 2100HP every 11.25 seconds.  Additionally I have
pet hold and the pet has astounding out of combat regen due to
focus.

I personally have 1200 ac, 1400 (self buffed) atk, 4800 (self buffed)
HP, 86% (self-buffed) haste.  And +9 mana/hp per tick from SD, +1200
hp/480 mana every 15 minutes from paragon.  Additionally, a 65 has
3 mana per tick standing regen.  I am a bazaar+1 group drops geared
BL (with a couple of raid pieces).

Compared too:

The 58 BL warder is level 45, 3750 hp (all mage toys+tuna+brawn), 
max hit 62, 76% haste, +50 atk, +90 dex, a 122 proc and is fighting
mobs that are 30% slowed.  The 58 can heal his pet for 1250 every
9.75 seconds.

The 58 bl haste is 41% max (Since he has no haste buff for himself
at this level - and that's only if he has a very nice haste item),
+325 hp from buffs, 7 levels less hp, 5 mana/hp per tick from SR and 
1 mana per tick standing.

Do you still want to claim that the 58 will get aa's faster than the
65?

His pet is slower, weaker and only 2 levels higher than the mob he's
fighting.  He's slower and on a lower damage table than I am.

My pet is faster, stronger and 11 levels above the mobs he's fighting.

My mobs hit harder, but they are attacking half as fast as the lower
level mobs.

We won't even mention the fact that my BL has never had any trouble finding
groups quickly at 65.  Then we hunt mobs that are level 62 and up.

A level 65 player in a full group killing level 62 mobs gets:

62*62*2.16*2.34*ZEM / 6 = 3238*ZEM
Alternativey - use the 1.8 bonuse for 5, then divide by 5 people (6th
is free).
62*62*1.8*2.34*ZEM / 5 = 3238*ZEM  (do you understand why the bonus
for 6 players is calculated as 2.16 now?)

So, the 58 killing 43's is getting 1849*ZEM, versus the 65 in
a group killing hard mobs getting 3238*ZEM.  Now the 58 has to
kill mobs 3238/1849 = 1.75 times as fast as the full group.

Since an average group of 65's tends to kill at around 33 mobs
per hours (we did that) the 58 has to kill his at 57 per hour.

When we XP'd in the Purifying Plant the mobs were level 64-65
(about half 65).  A level 65 mob gives a 65 player in a full
group:

65*65*1.8*2.6/5*ZEM = 3954*ZEM.

Because of their lower HP we managed 30 per hour down there.

3954/1849 = 2.13.  Now the 58 has to kill 64 an hour to keep up.

I've pegged 60 an hour in Dulak - with a 65 mage and low 50's
BL duo'd.  I very much doubt a 58 BL can do it solo.

Of course, the bar is even higher if we consider kill rates in
BoT, where my mage used to charm mobs that did over 500DPS 
(hasted and armed).  My BL lost 70ish DPS by not fighting when
I did that, he just slowed, used his pet, hasted, and buffed.

The kill rates then were pretty astronomical - clearing all 
mid sands and half of upper was common.

I didn't do that solo/duo much though, I prefer to have a snarer
when I do it (I'm a wimp, what can I say).

But I'll tell you what, you go ahead and stay 58 if that suits you.

But if you insist on claiming that AA come faster at that level, then
you're a complete moron.
