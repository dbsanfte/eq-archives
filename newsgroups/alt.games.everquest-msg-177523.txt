[32] Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess =
also before my Father which is in heaven.

[33] But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before =
my Father which is in heaven.

[34] Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send =
peace, but a sword.

[35] For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the =
daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother =
in law.

[36] And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

[37] He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: =
and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

[38] And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not =
worthy of me.

[39] He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life =
for my sake shall find it.

[40] He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me =
receiveth him that sent me.

[41] He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive =
a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of =
a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.

[42] And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a =
cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, =
he shall in no wise lose his reward.
