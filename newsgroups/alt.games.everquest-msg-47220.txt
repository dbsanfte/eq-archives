BZZZTTT! Wrong answer. It's the exact opposite, because of 4 magic
words:

***PRIMARY HAND DAMAGE BONUS***

Primary:
Best weapon, with bais towards speed over pure ratio

Secondary:
Bias toward larger damage and pure ratio

I believe the bonus is 11 damage per successful hit at L60, but don't
quote me on that. What damage bonus means, is that every single
successful hit, you get a fixed amount added to the damage. You hit more
often, you get more of those bonuses in a given time. Pick up a
Wurmslayer (high delay, great ratio, primary only) and test it yourself
if you don't believe me.

For the specific example:

Lam/Lam and Lam/CSS are about the same because the slight extra hps on
the Lam balance the slight extra offhand damage on the CSS. Get
whichever you find a bargain on first. Both are better than CSS/Lam
