	Cool!  Some guy has been selling chaining of some FT 1 ring for
	ages, but as he wants like 9k or such I figured a better goal would
	be to hunt down a 2+ item at those prices... But if FT stacks, then
	the FT 1 ring (no drop of course) would be a decent 'starter' ring.

	First, however, I want a horse. :-)

	My chars are only lvl 24 and 26, but I borrow my friend's lvl 45
	mage to farm HGs, hehe. -Also is handy to grab the mage-summoned
	focus effect items, most of which are better then "normal" ones and
	some (like save 15% mana on DD spells) that don't exist as normal
	items at all AFAICT?

	A question on the "Affliction" effect stuff.  Is that only DoTs and
	such, or is it any "damage" spell?  Players seem to think it's only
	DoTs, but Allahazam's description seems to imply any spell that does
	"hit point damage" or such?

	Thx for the link.  Hehe, I only started playing again since PoP. :-)
	I was very happy when I came back and found all my "junk" items all
	had some focus effect or another on them. :-)
