>What point? 

I thought he had a few good points, and I thought
he made them in a well written, tongue-in-cheek
manner. I accept the possibility I could be wrong
though.

First point; I know in the title of his post, he
asked if EQ was evil, but the text was asking if
the players were evil. That is, instead of the
players being the heroes, they are, in fact, the
villains.

Second point; He feels that he and his guild are
no more than a gang of well-armed thugs, and finds
the mobs intelligence somewhat lacking.

Third point; there is no alternative to this
perceived evil. There is no other viable
lifestyle, other than killing.

>His point looked to me to be that the game is evil because

Exactly. 

Perhaps he may feel it is similar to 'the war on
terrorism.' 

We have the tanks, and they have the stones.

Which may have been what he meant when he said;
"....Everquest in many ways matches incentives
with some of the most savage and deprived
neighborhoods and countries throughout the world."

As I said, I don't think he really meant that the
game was evil, but rather, that the game forces
the players into being 'evil'

You would have to ask him for clarification
though.
