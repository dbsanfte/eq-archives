    My level 13 necromancer would like every Kobold Molar she could get her
hands on, as the XP the quest gives is still visible and the cash/ringmail
reward has proven very rewarding - only caster I've EVER had that bought all
her spells at every level so far without any external aid. Too bad they're
No Drop, and poof on half the kobolds I need to fight from green aggro.
