Don't plan to switch or even try II.

EQ has, for me, some life left to it, it probably helps that I go 
offline for several months every year, so I come back freshened up a bit.

EQII will be a much smaller place, filled with bugs and really dismal 
balance issues.  I don't have to know anything about the game to know 
that; its the nature of the beast, EQ has had many years of expansions 
and bug fixes (could still use tons more) and balancing (thats by no 
means complete either); unless the new game is either a clone of EQ or 
has had 5 years and 400,000 playtesters and costs out at $320 for the 
box, it really can't be competitive.

If I'm going to start over, I'll want something new, not something that 
is sort of EQ only not so much.

SWG was more intriguing, COH more unique, WOW more tempting... none have 
budged me so far, but I will still consider the latter two after they've 
had some time to debug and balance and expand.
