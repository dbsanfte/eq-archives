Aye, I don't even know that notice was given, I'm just presuming that it 
was, since he said it was obvious. :)

They could, sure.  But past experience tells me that when the hamster 
dies, generally we get 'You Have Been Diconnected' with just a lag spike 
to warn us... And then have to deduce that the hamster died, and we didn't 
just LD, on the basis that there's now 15 General Chat channels on the 
chat server. :)
