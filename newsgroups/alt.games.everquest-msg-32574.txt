    I can imagine that's a "must dispel now" effect. I was nearly killed
last night by the Death Beetle's DoT, and that isn't as strong as EBolt. (I
imagine those glands are an unpleasant shock at times too.)

    Evade means rarely having to say you're sorry. ;-) I was invited to
Bats/Bugs at level 40 in Sol B, where most mobs are even cons or so. So I
started using a few poisons, to stay useful to the group - a few Lower
Resists II on Stone Spider and Death Beetle, but mostly Injected II (41
initial damage, 41 dam/tick for 5 ticks). My opening would be backstab,
autoattack (poison procs here), Evade. I could usually get them off me,
unless our crazy tank switched targets for the tenth time or backed up from
a rooted mob yet again. Not that I'm bitter.

    If it's the screenshot I'm thinking of, he had the warrior sit, too.
When someone's sitting the damage possible apparently goes up - max backstab
observed on a fighting opponent is just over 1100, but on the sitting
opponent with discipline activated the rogue in question landed a shot for
over 1300 damage. And seeing as how casters med.....

    It's funny - most people say rogues stink in PvP. But what they really
mean is rogues suck at duels, where everyone is prepared and there's room to
move. I can just imagine the VERY quick feeling of horror a caster on a PvP
server would get if he suddenly saw, "Rogue's muscles bulge with force of
will." Followed by one or two damage messages and LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.

    Ah, INT-caster armour - is that a 1-ply or 2-ply robe? ;-)

    If you get attacked by a rogue AND someone else, though, isn't it time
to cut losses and bail? Or are you able to take on superior numbers? In what
little I've read about PvP, the usual strategy against numbers is to run and
hope to split them up, just run, or have numbers of your own.

    Splurt must be a tough cast in PvP. Good for the long fight, but if he
can finish you fast he KNOWS he can Pumice it away before it does the bulk
of the damage it'll do. Splurt-Shadow Step must be fun - if a PvP target is
running around, does a DoT do 4/9ths damage? (Two thirds PvP rule, two
thirds moving target)

    That's good to know, that multiple attacks can stop spellcasting with
ease.

    As a 59 cleric without them, I can personally disprove that everyone has
them. :-/ But I despise camping items, so I'm likely the exception.

    /pet guard me is the standard, then?

    /cry - what did I do to you! Oh, yeah - you're a PK, and I'm a bluebie

    How does it react to an invisible opponent? Do you need See Invis up?
Does the opponent need up ITU or Invis to avoid an attack if you don't have
a see invis effect (although with DMF, like you ever lack one).

    VERY nice feature. Although you must begin to know the names of people
as time goes by, and know to get ready when the usual suspects zone in.

    It's good to hear that there's balance. When most people hear about PvP,
it's the big three - WIZ, NEC, DRU - beating the heck out of everyone else.
Nice to see that one class, or one small subset of classes, doesn't own
everyone else.
