first of all, I remember when monks were one of the most respected classes.
If you played a monk past 25, you knew yours stuff... then Kunark came out.
Ah well


On to the meat of the rant:
First, you'd be amazed at the number of people that play WITHOUT spell
effects on. So no lit up like a Christmas tree
Second, I've got a bug with the new UI. Other peoples spells don't show up
unless they specifically cast it on me.
Third, if you see a mob, target it, run over to it, and even attack and
miss, generally you don't see anything but full health.

But yes he was being a jerk. When I pull I usually walk up, throw a star,
whack it with a stick, and if it doesn't come I figure it's already engaged.
(good ks'r monks pull with flying kick.)

Well when I pull with my monk, which I haven't played in 6 months.

You can't call someone a killstealer if you never have agro on the mob he
'killstole' from you.

Now the cleric druid combo that was ks'ing from me was fun (they'd run up
after I had tash'd slowed dot'd and sic'd pet, and beat me at my own game,
the cleric atoning and druid dotting as the atone landed)

I got them though... They thought I'd gotten another (they were targeting me
specifically because I am an enchanter and thus weak soloer)...
unfortunately what they thought was tash slow dot was charm haste rune IV
berserker, hide as the atone is being cast...

GM told me that was the funniest /petition he ever read. Also requested I
not do it again or he'd officially warn me... though he did also tell them
to stop ks'ing me
