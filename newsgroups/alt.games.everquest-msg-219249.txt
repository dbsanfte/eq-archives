By itself, no. That's why you find other things to do while you're
tradeskilling. People to talk to, so on.

Thing is, personal experience when it comes to the opinions of others
CAN be very biased. In fact, it almost always is. I've seen people who
have played for years say that nobody roleplays in EQ and the majority
of EQers thing roleplaying is stupid, however, I had no trouble
finding roleplayers when I looked and am hard-pressed to find a more
people who think it's stupid than who don't when I bring it up... Who
you associate with can easily skew perceptions of the overall opinion
of things.

But only so much can be learned by someone explaining how to do it,
which is what the initial practice points at your trainer reflect and
the fact you can't dump more than 21 points at the trainer. You're in
a fantasy role playing game, yes, but there has to be some degree of
realism worked into it to make the game feasible overall.

They don't have to revolve around doing it, no, but it would be going
beyond the reasonable expectation of suspending disbelief to make it
so that you can master a tradeskill by running around and doing quests
rather than actually using the skill.
