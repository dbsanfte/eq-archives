I've done some newb armor quests that involved tradable bits (frog wizard,
troll beastlord, ogre warrior), and some that did not (wood elf druid,
dark elf shadowknight, human ranger, vah shir rogue), and some that were
tradable but not vendable (vah shir warrior on FV). And frankly, my vote
is tradable and vendable bits all the way.

(1) Definitely cuts down on the length of time one has to devote to newb
armor quests. While the quests give you something to do from 1-12, with
vendable items you aren't required to do nothing but the quest in order
to get your drops. With my troll beastlord and frog wizard, I was able to
explore other zones for fun, loot, and xp without feeling like I was
screwing over my chances of getting quest drops from the mobs while they
would still give me xp.

(2) The fact that the drops are tradable and vendable means an extra,
level-appropriate income stream for the aspiring newb. I made ~600pp from
spiderling silks and zombie skins by level 5 while xping off spiderlings
and zombies, and felt really cheezy while doing it. On the other hand, I
felt really good about getting a few gold from selling to merchants the
quest bits I didn't need: I was making some money *and* helping out other
newbie frogs.

(3) Most of the newbie armor quest drops aren't actually that fun. They're
endurance tests. Yippie. Rare drops off mobs that spawn in random spots
and wander randomly in zones with ultra-low visibility. Nothing more
exciting than camping green mobs for hours for that last drop you need and
still not getting it. Or being killed constantly by aggressive red mobs
with huge aggro range while simply trying to *find* the mobs that drop
what you want. These quests are high-visibility introductions for new
players to the world of EQ. They should evoke something more than a
post-dental-visit cry of "thank god it's over". With sellable drops, at
least there's the chance that someone else found something you're looking
for while you were offline.

(4) And it's not like you actually *have* to buy the drops. I bought about
75% of the drops for my frog wizard quests, camped 20% myself, was given
the remaining 4% by frogs who didn't need drops they'd gotten. Of the drops
I bought, most were ones I eventually got anyway from chance encounters.
Of the ones I camped myself, half were ones I never saw on vendors ever.
Just because stuff is vendable doesn't mean you will actually find them on
merchants when you need them.

>Let's see Iksar quests next!

And vah shir quests too! :/
