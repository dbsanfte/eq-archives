I was one of the many that jumped ship back in November 2004, and the 
impression Ive got from listening to the various forums is that SOE is 
trying very hard to regain lost ground, and has indeed learned a lot from 
its mistakes from POP through to OOW.
If they wanted to kill off eq it would be very easy, just pull the plug 
(metaphorically speaking).

Trouble is, its still SOE, and future lessons probably have to be learned 
the hard way too, as your post suggests. EQ may have improved dramatically, 
but its still the same clueless stubborn extremely-greedy company running 
it.
