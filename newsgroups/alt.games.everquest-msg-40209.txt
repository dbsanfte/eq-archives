so i suffered my first real yucky death...lost a bunch of great equpment in
kithicor forest.  luckily, an in-game friend had set me up with a little bit
of cash prior, so i went back to freeport to re-equip.  i found the leather
shop in west freeport, and went to dude myself out from head-to-toe in
leather armour.  checked to make sure my race and class (dwarf warrior)
could use the stuff.  okey-dokey.  spend about 12 pp...AND I GET THE RED
ERROR MESSAGE TELLING ME IT'S FORBIDDEN FOR EITHER CLASS, RACE OR DEITY
REASONS!  only thing i can think of is i'm good and i'm in a bad port of
freeport...
any suggestions?
tia.
