I wouldn't call it common.  It does happen, and it is brutal and tragic.
How about we kill the rapist, and not the innocent child?

BTW, you lost me on the mystic thing.

Hardly.  I'm just saying that, the majority of women were not victims of
rape.  You can't use it as a justification for killing babies.  And as far
as those who are victims go, how about we bring the rapist to justice,
instead of committing another atrocity?

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
