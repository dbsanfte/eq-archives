I did look there, I just didn't wade through the pages and pages of
followups to the table post.  Thanks for the info, I'll be sure to do so
next time.  I did get the mob names at some point, just had to guess where
they were, my guesses were about the same as yours.  The Coterie and Tro Jeg
were the ones I was concerned about, as there are a number of spawn points
for them in the zones in question.  I was hoping for some definate
information on a specific camp, or that they can spawn in any of them, or
some such.  I'll dig into the mounds of posts there, and see what I can
find.
