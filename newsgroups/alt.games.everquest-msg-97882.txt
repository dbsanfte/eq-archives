Excuse me?  Enchanters are not only one-third of the holy trinity, but are 
pretty much considered to be about as balanced as any class, if not overpowered.  
Not only that, but they DID just make changes to the memory blur type spells, 
which are the baliwick of enchanters.
An enchanter whining about needing fixes, I guess you want to be able to solo as 
well as a druid too.  /boggle
