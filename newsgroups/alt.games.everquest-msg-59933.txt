I am looking at putting together some training boxes, but I would like these
to double as some EQ party boxes as well.

I am looking at the following items as possibilities.  I know they will all
work for the training side, but it is the integrated video that may be the
problem:

I am trying to keep the form factor small for portability (will add LCD
later).  Once again, EQ is secondary, but I would like to get a very small
system that will run it if possible.

Thanks,

Brian
