Alt P is correct. The party window may well be hidden behind the Main menu
(Alt M). Mine was when I first went to full screen mode and I didn't realize
it until later. I kept going back to half screen mode (the default) to find
the status of the group. Silly me.

Click the little boxes in the upper left and lower right corners (if
available) to move your windows around and put them in the positions and
sizes you like. I'd also recommend going to a higher resolution (800x600 or
higher) when in full screen mode so the boxes and icons are smaller and take
up less screen space. It is a little annoying to then go back to half screen
mode when medding or checking inventory where everything is shrunk down to
640x480 but you'll get used to it. Full screen mode is way better than half
even with the unreadable blue text for emotes, pet messages and whatnot.

Read the manual supplement.txt (forget the exact file name) in your EQ
directory. It tells you the options for your .ini file.
