Yep, 100pp was pretty much standard for the longest time.  My fiancee
gave me a couple more stacks of them on Saturday.  An hour after
listing them at 30pp each (the cheapest of the 7 dealers in the
bazaar) they were snatched up.  I am sure that a lot of this will be a
"ride the wave" thing while you can.  Many simply just dont want to
take the time.  I mean, if you are someone like Ryme or Ninor (not
sure if she still plays) or a few of the other with high 6 digit
incomes in Norrathian Plat, 600p is a drop in the bucket.  I am doing
OK, but I will NEVER see paying that much as acceptable for me LOL.  I
think back to last Halloween when I had 22 stacks of Silk Swatches
from the EK events.  Man, could have been sitting on a
goldmine....well, Platinum LOL.

Ahh, but you are.  Iron oxide is a GROUND SPAWN in one low level zone.
At least unless it was changed with some other modifications that were
made to the zone.  Havent been there to check it out lately.

My point on this was how amazing some of the prices are that are being
paid or asked for various items in relation to how expensive they are
to make or how easy they are to obtain=)
