Sorry, you don't know that for a fact, because it doesn't happen.  They
don't *try* the new mission.  They *simulate* trying the new mission with
computer models and such.

It's a ridiculous method of testing that misses some glaringly obvious
bugs that never should have made it live.

To answer your question, what Sony could do is actually *do* things instead
of relying on computer models and hoping the *models* don't have any bugs.

Legitimate bugs, like characters being able to gain an AA point by spinning
clockwise three times while clicking their skills button as fast as possible
and doing the yawn /emote with a banker targeted...  those are fine. 
Because you're right about one thing, they can't test every possible
situation.  Some of the worst bugs fall into this category, including most
dupe bugs, etc.

Ridiculous bugs include putting in a new monster mission, announcing it in
the patch, and it being so broken that it requires GM assistance to
transport out the first people to try it on the live servers and get stuck. 
Nobody at Sony did that mission before it went live.  Not once.  Obviously.

Ridiculous bugs include making a mission only winnable by looting a shard,
then not putting in the shards.  Nobody at Sony did that mission before it
went live.  Not once.  Obviously.

Ridiculous bugs include putting in a spell that when cast on a player causes
them to take obscene amounts of damage from anything that hits them.  Nobody
at Sony actually tried the spell.  Obviously.
