Why?
IF he should suffer some kind of relapse I'd be all for bringing up
his past, but while he's acting like a normal, contributing member,
his posts will get more respect from me than this particular diatribe
of yours will.
You spend enough time complaining about Madbomma etc. to make you the
LAST person who should campaign for stalking and harassing another
poster over past troubles.
