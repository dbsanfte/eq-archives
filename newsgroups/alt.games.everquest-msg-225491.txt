While I was aware of this about Naggy, I really had it driven home while 
clearing the giants; they too are immune to spells outside melee range, 
and it took me casting on three seperate giants and getting 100% resists 
before I realized it.  I wasn't alone though, I spoke to the other mage 
in the giant clearing team and she -also- hadn't been able to land a 
spell and didn't know why.  Once we both started running up to where the 
  rogues stood neither of us had a single resist.

Why its a standard resist message instead of a much more informative 
"hey you have to get closer to cast on a giant, dork" message I don't 
know, its very deceptive.

The casting box on Naggy seems to be small enough that the ping ponging 
that went on caused half the spells I cast to miss... although that 
could be an illusion, perhaps Naggy's resists are so high that he just 
naturally resisted my efforts.  We had no Tash, just Malosi, and the 
bards weren't singing OOS, having been ordered to sing nothing but their 
two resist songs.  It looked to me, though, that when I was dead under 
his belly spells landed, and when he swung around to any other position 
(I always started casting in the right place, but he'd get moved during 
the cast duration!) I'd get resisted.

He was malosied by about 50%, as its the first thing I stuck.  I'd have 
stuck it sooner, but we were explicitly ordered not to cast it at all... 
apparantly the raid leader believes its a very high aggro spell for some 
reason.  I'm afraid I disobeyed this order, but not until after the 
"nuke freely" message; given my own head I'd have cast it the second we 
got into the room, I've never seen it aggro anything that had -any- 
reason to hate someone else.  With all the low level casters in the 
raid, I felt the time and mana spent on malosi would result in a lot 
more net damage (via lessened resistances to their nukes) than any nuke 
in my arsenal
