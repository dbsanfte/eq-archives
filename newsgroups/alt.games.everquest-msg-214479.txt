You can tell if you've hidden by targeting yourself. ie. /target myself
If you fail then you are hidden, if you target yourself then you are not.
(This one trick on this though, if you have see invisibility up you cannot
use this method)
Also, its my understanding that Hide (any hide) will work against
undead & living (but you cannot move unless you are a Rogue and
sneaking).
