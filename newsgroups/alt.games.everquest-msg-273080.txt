My provisioner is up to 27 now.  I've started making Fayberry Milks (tier 
3).  The top quality lasts 3:22 hours.  I have had no problem selling the 
lesser versions (minimum time 2:45 or thereabouts) for 30s each.  If I ever 
feel bored enough to fight with the keg/stove to get more of the top 
quality, I might start selling it.  If so, it'll be around 40s each until I 
start getting competition (food goes for a LOT less...like 2s).

Now, imagine if you will consuming one of these pricy babies a minute before 
your puller brings in a few extra adds and you die...? :p
