I wouldn't discount the difference KEI makes in one fight though.

For my warrior with a fungi, each tick a fight lasts is akin to my
putting on an additional item with 15 hps, without removing any of my
other items.

With my caster, each tick a fight lasts is akin to putting on an item
with an additional 14 mana.  This is in addition to the extra mana KEI
adds to your overall pool in the first place.  If a kite lasts 2
minutes, I go from, let's say, a 2000 mana caster to a (2280 +
whatever bonus 25 to my main stat adds) mana caster.  That difference
gets even more pronounced the lower level I go.

That makes a huge difference when I'm kiting.
