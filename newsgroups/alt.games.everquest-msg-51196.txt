It's not like you usually need the skill points for much of anything else.
It took me longer to raise my skill level with a WIS of 135ish at the time,
STR of 130ish.  I did not take my own advice, and advanced as far as
possible sharpening rusty weapons until I couldn't anymore.  Then I gave
away the remainder of my sharpening stones to someone in Qeynos where they
are not available.  That part of raising the skill is not the hard part
though, it gets expensive quickly.
