I play on The Rathe, and my original EQ character was a human Necromancer
named Ezrad Gravecreeper, who I deleted when he was lvl 20. I had quit EQ
for about 5 months and when I came back I started using my current main,
Zyrtryx Conjureblade, a High Elf Magician, and was tired of having to do
corpse runs all the time as Ezrad due to the fact that Gather Shadows had a
bad habit of either fizzling or wearing off soon after casting about 80% of
the time I cast it, even when I had Divination maxed for whatever level he
was at the time.

I'm slow at levelling my character, because I have a few alts that I also
run. I spent about 4 months playing EQ when I originally ran Ezrad (This was
right after Luclin came out and I spent way more time at the EC flea market
than a should have), and I've had Zyrtyx now for about seven months (not
counting the two months I took off from EQ), and he's only lvl 40.

I spend a lot of time working on tradeskills with Zyrtryx (I'm working on
Baking and Brewing, but haven't decided which one to GM yet, and I'm also
doing Fishing) because I can't find a group when I want one, and I'm not too
fond of soloing. The problem is that Magicians are apparently an overlooked
and underrated class and its hard to find groups. And its seriously ticking
me off. Especially when I spend a great deal of time sitting in a zone
ooc'ing that I'm LFG only to get no responses whatsoever even when I know
there are groups there that aren't full. Some of the people in my guild have
offered to help, but I get a feeling its more out of pity than out of
genuinely wanting to group with me, and from what I've seen finding another
guild won't help, because its pretty much because of anti-Magician bias more
than anything. (For the record, I'd take a Magician over a Wizard in a group
any day, unless we really needed someone who could do ports and no Druids
were around, because with a Magician you're getting a caster AND a tank -
namely the pet)

I want to get to lvl 44 so I can solo HGs. I can't do it at 40 because a
giant can destroy my pet faster than I can heal the pet or nuke the giant to
death, but at lvl 44 I get spells that will change all that. (A nuke that
does twice as much damage as my current one, a fire-based dot, a better pet
healing spell, and a pet heal over time spell, mainly)

Unfortunately, its a pain in the butt getting a group so I CAN level.

So basically, what I want to ask is this (I know you're going ask why didn't
I skip all the above and just ask the question, but....):

Should I just suck it up, go solo the Yetis in DL to level up, then tell the
people who won't group with me now to go to Hell if a  they ever need my
help for a corpse run or to save them from a train or something later
on.....

Or I should I just dump the Magician as my main (I won't delete him - His
tradeskills are too high for me to not at least keep him for a tradeskill
mule) and go level up a group-friendly alt?

I've recreated Ezrad as a DE Necro and have him up to lvl 8 so far, but I've
also got a lvl 8 Vah Shir Shaman (currently just used as a storage toon), a
14 Halfling Ranger and a lvl 15 Human Monk that I could use.....
