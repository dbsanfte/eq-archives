I referred to it as mudflation earlier, but this is what I was actually 
thinking of. This is what takes all the replayability out of EQ. It was 
really fun on your first character, but once you can twink like crazy or 
buy all that gear much earlier than before, that just leaves a long grind 
right back to the upper levels.

I've tried just not twinking at all, but it doesn't work when everyone 
around still does it. Heck, even earning your own plat through farming 
tradeskill items detracts from the experience.

I think a NODROP server is a great idea.
