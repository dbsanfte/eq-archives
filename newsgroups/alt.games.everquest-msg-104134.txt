I was having a few problems with everquest and decided it was time to
reinstall everything and try out windows xp. Well, now i've got a weird
problem where occasionally i'll either get a garbled screen or a black
screen. By sitting and camping back to the server list i can get the screen
back.

I have a geforce 2, latest drivers, that seems fine when i try out the demos
from nvidia designed to test out it's capabilities. I have 512 meg ram and
have tried turning of half the models just in case.

Has anyone got any ideas as to what is causing this and how to fix it?

Thank ye kindly!
