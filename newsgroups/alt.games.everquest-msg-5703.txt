Levelitis is actually a social disorder that occurs when players want to
continue playing EQ with their friends.  Once your social group reaches
levels 51-60; there isn't a big "need" to gain levels because your friends
will never really "out-level" you.  If I had the choice of making my main
character level 51 tomorrow, with the penalty that level 51 would also be
the highest that character could ever go; I would do it in a red-hot second.

The phat-lewtz thing is something I've never understood.  Good loot can
certainly extend a warrior's ability to solo into the latter levels, but is
a sebelite chest (6000pp) that much better than my blood-stained tunic
(100pp)?  Will a jade chokadai prod make me any better of a shaman than an
ebon war spear?  I would be willing to bet that a sebelite chest and a slime
coated harpoon would not allow me to solo creatures that I could not
normally solo with my blood-stained tunic and ebon war spear.  However, we
are talking a huge difference in money to acquire the items or a huge
difference in time to acquire the items.  It is not logical and makes no
sense mathematically.  I honestly believe the whole item thing is Verant's
version of the skinner box; and just like the skinner box, the rats pressed
the lever most often when rewards were given at random intervals, rather
than every time the lever was pushed.
