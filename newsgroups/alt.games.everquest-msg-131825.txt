Hm. This comes too close after the atheism threads to be a coincidence. 
Maybe there is a God after all... :)

The funniest thing is, I had already decided to trade in my PC as part-
payment for a PowerMac, even if it meant leaving EQ, because I really want 
to own a computer that doesn't suck (well, I already do, an SGI Indy, but 
the poor thing is about ten years old and growing long in the tooth by now), 
and because I diss Microsoft at every chance I get, and it was high time to 
put my money where my mouth is.

Well, it looks like I'll get to have my cake and eat it too. :)
