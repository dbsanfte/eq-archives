heh wasn't disputing your facts biz, is all hearsay to me though.  My
original post was based on what the news reports said and then my follow
up based on what you said.  I clearly don't know the facts other than
what folks have said, you included, so I tossed that clause in.

Say what you will about OJ, but you can't fault the jurors for that
verdict.  The prosecution seemed to forget they needed to prove their
case while busy buying new suits and having their hair done.  While OJ
going free may have been a travesty of justice, so too would have been
convicting him based on the case presented.

Well if you followed this case as closely as you apparently followed
this judge's opinion, then you know that she wasn't convicted cause she
was wearing a blue shirt, not because folks didn't like the railroad and
the victim certainly was killed, no question about that.
