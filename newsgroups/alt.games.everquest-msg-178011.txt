Well for a time VT/Emp/Seru were the endgame.  There was no advancement..
nothing higher to kill, nothing new to explore.

Now though, is even half of PoP defeated?   RZ is just a mob on the way to
the "new end-game" (obviously different mob, but I guess like killing AL or
shei, on the way to end-game Luclin)

Before all you could do was farm.. now theres a lot of chances to make a
name for yourself, be the first to do something game-wide etc

We have a big raid crew online before anybody else, since our first ever
cursed kill, we've killed every single pop since.. so we've killed him an
absolute assload too.

The loot was extremely unbalanced (1 monk/dru BP, 2 plate bp's, 5+ chain
BP's).. I already said abut the weapon drop-rates...  but definately too
much ranger gear!

Ranger gear...  I think just about every boss mob we've killed in PoP has
dropped a fuckin bow.  STOP with the ranger gear plz!
