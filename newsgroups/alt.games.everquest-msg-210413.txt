Fine Steel and Velium weapons sell for upwards of 3-6pp each. Find a place
that drops those, such as Unrest (now) or Tizmak caves in GD (when you get
a couple lvls). Those are instant cash items that you dont have to wait
around to try to sell to someone. You can make a few hundred off that sort
of stuff a day with little effort.
