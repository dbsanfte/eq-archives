In that regard, my friends started EQ shortly before I did. They called 
it quaynoze before I ever saw the word, and its a known fact that the 
human brain sees what it expects to see, so -I- didn't even notice that 
it didn't have a u for some months thereafter. (Starting in Freeport, 
and not even going to qeynos for the first couple months didn't help 
either).

But even so... really... the number q words without u is pretty darn 
small, and I for one, am prepared to forgive the education system for 
glossing over them, particularly since they are all borrowed words from 
Turkish, Arabic, and Persian and don't follow english pronounciation 
rules anyway.

Oh, and I'm not an 'American'.
