Anyone know what they mean when they say server?

I'm assuming the word server means, lots of servers, handling various zones
and other functions, like login, db, etc. Since they are instancing most
zones when required, one 'server', could be any number of real servers,
able to support a huge number of instanced zones.

With EQ1, each zone required X resource on Server Y.  You needed Z number
of servers to cope with all the zones, for each 'world'.

With EQ2, there's no reason to suspect that instances of zones can't run on
different back-end servers.  In which case, a small number of 'world
servers' is perfectly reasonable from a technical stance, if they can just
shove more instance handling boxes on the back.

The issue then of course is login and db queries.

So basically, I think it's more flexible than EQ's approach, and hence,
doesn't require the same number of 'worlds', alongside all the other points
people have mentioned already.
