It isnt a problem at all . The high tech computer industry faces this right
now , in that everyone who wanted a computer now has one . Now to sell a
computer it has to be a better computer as an upgrade , or a cheaper
computer for new births into the marketplace. Kinda like being able to make
velium jewelry , and kinda like being able to make luclinite jewelry :p They
have the right idea it is just that there implementation is sadly lacking
for most of the tradeskills.
