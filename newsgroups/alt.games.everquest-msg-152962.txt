I agree; like with the Bullsmasher quest, one of my characters turned
in quite a few boxes to the guy in the Ak'anon warrior guild before
she finally got the Bullsmasher, but like your Sledgemallet quest, I
just did it off and on in short stints, not this whole BS about having
to spend days camping for an item (which I refuse to do and wouldn't
be able to anyway even if I wanted to).

I'm in agreement with you and Rumbledor about this whole "camping"
deal; does Verant really have no clue about people actually having a
life and not being able to spend DAYS online (or call in sick or take
time off from work) just to get some rare mob?  I'm pretty much
resigned to the fact that I'll probably never get an epic item either
<shrug>.
