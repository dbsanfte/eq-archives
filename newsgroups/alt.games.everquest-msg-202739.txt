Don't count on it. Pre KEI it was blamed on all the EBAYed toons.
Always some whiners reason to blame something other than the fact a player
may be just not a good player.
Prior to the EBAY grumblers it was the great Evils of twinking and
powerleveling.
But again some that seek to blame can only find a solution in nerfing.
Oh I call it a nerf. Sony has never called any nerf a nerf btw.
Just a fix, balancing, adjustment, whatever.

My mains have been rogues over the years and started so horrible they have
been unnerfed over time.
However playing many alts Fungis and uber weapons made playing lowbies a fun
change of pace.
KEI made the casters a good change of pace.
I generally disagree with nerfs on principal as being a bad form of making
game changes.
I don't know of any other game with such massive downtime. Why make a game
.. work ?
