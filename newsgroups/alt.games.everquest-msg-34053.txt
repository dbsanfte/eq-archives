3 charges of 0.0 cast time Conflagration, Lore item, drops in Hate I
think, wizard only. Conflagration is a 380-390damage (in pvp) fire-based
dd. For whatever reason, it seems to have a different resistance check
or something, as every time I get flag wanded it does 80%-100% of its
maximum possible damage, whereas draught of fire or ordinary
conflagration from the same person will be far more random (anywhere
from 5%-100%).

After reading the replies, it seems people do have gate up on blue
servers quite a bit more than I expected. Hey, you learn something every
day! :p
