Greetings!

If I remember correctly, the full screen, transparent inventory box thingie
is a feature that comes with the Scars of Velious Expansion.  At the time
the expansion was released, updating wiht the expansion was the only way to
enable the feature . . . I am not certain if they have changed this though.
When I installed  Scars of Velious, it happened by itself (I hit "I" and the
inventory box came up instead of changing screens like it used to)

I hope this helps :)
