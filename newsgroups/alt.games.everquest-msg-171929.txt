/quote kaev:
Whether he's saying that or not, there are an awful lot of players
who behave as if they believe it to be true.  This has been true for
years, and it isn't just Enchanters that all the morons try to jam
into some tiny little pigeon-hole.  Ask a Bard about grouping and
mana song.  Or consider the ever popular belief (recently stated
once again in this group by some idiot or other) that "all Wizards
are good for is ports and evec".  Or the amazement people express
when they discover how well things can go in a group with a well
played Druid, Paladin, or Shadow Knight in it (of course, some won't
get it, they'll tell their friends "XXXXX is easy, we did it with
just a Druid for a healer", as they lead them to their doom).

That reads to me as a post decrying the ignorance of many players.
It's not much of a rant.  And besides, you snipped that and replied
to my little joke along the same lines, insisting that I was much
more ignorant than I believed myself to be.  My reference to the
/quote kaev
all-to-common "stfu and play manasong" morons
/quote
came several posts later as an attempt to illustrate the difference
between the idiots I encounter when I join groups (I very rarely
lead, it is not one of my strengths so I have to be somewhere I know
intimately if I'm gonna lead or I'm likely to be the group's biggest
liability) and the idiots you encounter when you group (and I'd be
willing to bet that you are usually the group's leader, whether you
are tagged as such by the game mechanic or not).

No way.  I posted that on a Tuesday and its been ages since I settled
into a Monday and Friday only schedule for being a moron.

It appears to me that we're talking about the same problem (players
players demonstrating crippling ignorance) from two very different
collections of experience.  In my case, most of the people I've grouped
with were very ignorant of what other classes could do and many of them
didn't know a whole helluva lot about what their own class could do
beyond one or two simple tactics they never varied from.  This has
meant that, in general, most of the people I've been grouped with have
no business at all trying to tell somebody else what they ought to be
doing, hell half the time they don't even seem to know what they're
doing.  The best thing that happens with a group like that is to have a
player join who actually knows how to use his/her class effectively,
and the last thing we need is for the group leader to start demanding
that the newcomer cripple themself.

We see the same stupidity James, but our roles are very different.  As
I noted above I am not a strong leader.  So I have naturally tended to
play flexible support classes where my attention to detail helps make
me effective.  That doesn't prevent me from filling a narrow role,
even a stereotypical role, when it is warranted.  You, on the other
hand, are apparently much more assertive, and as noted above I would
be surprised to learn that you were not usually your group's defacto
leader even when somebody else had the tag.  The narrow and easily
managed role of your Cleric frees you to exercise your talent as a
leader.  The difference then is that when I'm grouped the leader is
the one most likely to cripple the group with ignorance (due simply to
greater opportunity to make a mess of things) and newcomers bring hope
of improvement, while when you're grouped a newcomer is more a source
of dread as you already have the existing collection of characters
measured and fitted into your plans.
