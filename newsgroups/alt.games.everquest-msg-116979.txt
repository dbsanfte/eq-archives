 Which isn't even what I said. What I said was "However, I don't think
I've even see a Ranger outdamge me in any one of my parses."

 Obviously disciplines are an exception. Trueshot every 72 minutes? I
don't think I really need to worry about that Ranger.

 Not anymore they can't since the stacking issues were fixed. Also,
again with the 'certain conditions'. I'm talking about overall averages
across the board, not certain encounters/conditions. That's like me
adding in the 32000 hits from finishing blow and saying I'm getting
511dps.

 In addition to the link Martin posted (I haven't checked it out)
there's the thread I posted previously:

http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=10627.topic

 Primal buff alone gets you about 15% rather than 30%. Still a rather
nice boost in damage output for the soloer. Add in other ATK buffs in
raid situations and you'll see the 30%.


 Anyway, not meant as a Monk vs Ranger thread. In 'certain
circumstances' I can see a Ranger outdamaging me, that much is a given.
For all those 'normal circumstances' I don't see it happening.
