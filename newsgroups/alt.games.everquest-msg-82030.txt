Heh-heh, bards do decent damage eventually.  Plus we can toss in a 599 pt 
nuke once every 5 minutes (assuming epic).  <flexes>

Nope.  Been an issue forever, think it truly is working as intended, and 
only enchanters will ever have an AE mez.  I actually hope it is that way, 
because frankly, if bards had AE mez, enchanters would deserve duel wield 
and plate.  Class balance and all.

Yeah, and it gets to be a lot like work when you are trying to get him 
every time he spawns.  Though it's not really that much time.  For the 
spawned Trak for my epic I think I was logged on for less than an hour, 
and I started in Nexes.  Of course I travel a bit better than most--see 
rant about traveling with warriors.

Two songs that bards have use mana, level 39 charm song, which is limited 
to mobs level 51 and below, and our level 43 nuke that does max 530ish 
targetted AE damage and blows the majority of our manabar.  The real bitch 
is that bards have no way to boost mana regen, meditate is capped at about 
10, clarity and manasong don't do anything, neither do mod-rods or necro 
twitchs.  It does seem that the AA mana regen does affect bards, which 
makes soloing by charm-fighting viable again, once you hit 55 and dump 
enough AA points in to get mental clarity maxxed out. 
The best place to find out bard info, other than your nearest bard would 
be www.eqdiva.com  We're not quite as into figuring out the quests and 
posting the newest gear as the rogues, but we talk alot.

Hmmm, yeah, I guess I can think of quite a few 60 monks, but only because 
you guys are everywhere doing solo exp.  I used to be suprised when I was 
the only character for 3 zones other than a monk hiding out doing exp in a 
corner.
