Not refering to Wood (the ae)
Although admittedly, its a bit of a stretch to compare NR and quis/elix -
but what else would you class it as?

I can just use quiesensce in tier 2-3 zones and keep my (tanking) monk alive
np.

Its my main heal for SolRo, for the spider queen, for every mob just about
that casts an AE in the elementals.
It works just fine on riposte damage and brief agro on people - the only
time it isnt effective (just like any HoT) is uncontrolled agro.

In a 1 minute or so PoE exp group fight, he will proc on average 4 times.
Never had a resist or partial resist either.
Btw 200+DPS is too high - its more like 170+ DPS (for rogues and monks)

That figure uses these weapons as its guideline btw,
Rogue mainhand: Khalshazar,  16/20 Piercer, Skill Mod: Backstab +15 %
Rogue offhand: Tendonslicer, 15/20 Piercer, Skill Mod: Backstab +10 %
Monk mainhand: Rune Etched Bamboo Bo, 42/28 2H Blunt  Effect: Claw of Khati
Sha (Combat)
(Ferocity, Punishing blade, ingenuity, Wu's 5, Ambidex, Fury of ages all
maxed, for both chars where applicable)

I offer only Fo7 and Boar on raids too. I will keep Bih'li and Ferine up on
my group, but not on anybody else unless friends ask.
I have guild shamans who will cast every stat buff including group PE
though.

The difference between my raid buffs and exp group buffs is down to space
and effectivness though.
In exp groups I don't have Bot9, Kazad and WoGall - I have just Virtue.
I don't need a slot open for Spirit of Wood, I don't need levi or DMF, EB or
resists
I don't have to worry about every group having the maximum possible ATK or
mana regen cuz it doesn't matter... in exp groups it does make a hugely
noticable difference though.

UV, see invis, combats stamina loss from being underwater.

Because some shamans probably don't see or understand what an extra ATK buff
means.

How so?

Well of course.  But what 2k heals exist that cost 1% mana to cast, cast in
<2 seconds, and can be chained continously?
