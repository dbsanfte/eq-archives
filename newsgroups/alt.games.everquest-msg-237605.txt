Same problem here - until I got LDoN. 59-65 went quickly - just need to try
for groups where you are one of the lowest. The easiest way is start a group
yourself and using the LFG tool you can send tells to pick them. It would be
rare to get a 63-65 to group (they would lose too many adv points) but you
should be able to pick up 60-62's.
