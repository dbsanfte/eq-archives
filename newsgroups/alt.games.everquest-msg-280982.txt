Aye, it's helpful on a Cursed raid.  Definately needed for an Emperor raid
or you're stuck camping the Assasin's room. :)  There are also a good number
of locked rogue-only doors in Vex Thal (goo1 comes to mind).  There's also a
door or two in Sebilis if my memory serves me correctly.

But aside from that as an easier-and-more-commonly obtained goal, having a
rogue along for the City of Mist or Chardok for the royal family for the 1.0
epic is quite helpful (for rangers, shammies, enchanters, clerics).
