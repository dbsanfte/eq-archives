I've noticed that many Rogues don't -want- to chain stun their targets since
it's a little bit harder to keep up. Necromancer/Rogue would pretty much
allow the Rogue to get constant free shots when Fear kiting. -Of course, if
that suits their fancy that would be fine, too... <shrug>

Cleric/Warrior... that would work. Cleric/Shadow Knight, also would work.
Cleric/Paladin, once again, would also work.


The goal isn't really just to make an uber pair, just one that both people
would like so that they can play together for a long time. It doesn't seem
that they want to pair up and raid Sebilis. They probably just want to spend
time together.
