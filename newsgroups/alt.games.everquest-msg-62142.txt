Ok.  I have DX8.0 installed, re-installed my video and sound drivers,
updated my eqclient.ini to dx8 and patched thru the Test server.

Last nite I logged on to Povar into NFP.  Everything looked fine.  I zone
into WFP and everything still looked fine *until* I saw the NPCs and PCs.
They were all floating in the air!  Not bobbing like they were lev'd, just
looked like they were on the wrong y-axis.  As I would approach them they
would lower to the ground.  It also appeared that I too was above the
ground.  After changing my eqclient.ini back to dx7 everything returned to
normal.

Any ideas on what I did wrong?

Thanks.
