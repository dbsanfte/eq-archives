Sort of.

%T is your target's name
%O is the object pronoun (him, her, it) of your target
%P is the possessive pronoun (his, hers, its) of your target
%S is the subject pronoun (he, she, it) of your target

I believe %R is the race of your target (only works for players) and %M is 
the pet name, if your target has a pet.

Anyways, in your case, make the macro:

/pause 2, /target Drood
/g Now healing %T
/pause 2, /cast 8
/pause 2, /cast 8
/cast 8

The first pause, btw, is because sometimes there's lag in switching 
targets.  If you don't do something like that, you occasionally get the 
wrong value for %T (Now Healing Target, or worse, Now Healing A Troll 
Invader!)  Also note that prefacing a line with a pause actually causes the 
pause to happen after the line executes, which is a bit counterintuitive.  
The first pause executes after the /target command.

I only suggest the last sequence of casting to combat fizzles.  Putting 
three in a row like that with pauses in between does a better job of 
ensuring the spell actually fires (if it fires the first time, the second 
two times will just give you a 'can't do that' type message), which can be 
important in healing.

You'll still have to change the name every time you want to change the 
target, using that macro.  It's really only useful if you have a well-
defined tank that you're almost always healing.  I think most people would 
just handle the targeting themselves and use lines 2 through 4 in a macro.
