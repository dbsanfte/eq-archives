You can be bound in Paineel, you won't be able to bank there, as you will be
KOS, but it's not hard to avoid the guards on zoning into Paineel.  It's also
not that far of a run to go to erudin if you want to bank.  You can't be bound
in Stonebrunt at the kitty village however.  I would say at 18, you will have
trouble soloing in stonebrunt, but not positive of that, as I am higher level
and a druid.  the mobs around your level are in camps more like the orc camps in
g'fay or EC.  Most of the camps have 4+ Kobolds, but they are close to the zone
line.  If you go now while the zone is new and popular, you can probably find a
group at any time of day or night.  I don't expect that to last due to the
Trivial Loot Code.  The zone is very pretty and there are mobs that con blue to
a 53,  so there is a wide level range, though I would say the greater part of
the zone is probably 15-35.
