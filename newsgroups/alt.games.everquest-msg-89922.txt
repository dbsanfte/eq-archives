When the leader (either group leader or ACTUAL leader) or designated "RUN"
caller makes the call, you're perfectly within your rights to run and not
feel too guilty about it.

Certainly any OOM healer should run, and all INT casters should at least
retreat some & maybe get one last nuke off to give the folks staying a
little better chance.  Often melee folks will stay to the bitter end unless
the fight is so hopeless the truth sinks into their thick skulls.
