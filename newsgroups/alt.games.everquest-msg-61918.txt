Least it's big and obvious enough that people know exactly what they're
getting into when they see you coming. ):oP

I guess every high level warrior in the game is doing it wrong wielding
sceptres, jaelens, primals etc, when they could taunt just as well with
a 30/40 1hb blam stick from PoM and do more damage? I assume the term
'damage bonus' means nothing to you?

Wurmslayer is, and always has been (since it became primary only), part
of the 'black pearl jewelery' school of warriorship. The one where they
teach you not to dribble so much in public, and the highest honour is a
doctorate in walking and chewing gum at he same time.
