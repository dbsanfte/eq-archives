The web pages I found on the Cray X1 contradict your claims about
the same computer. I guess you don't read well.

Oh lets see. Cray says their X1 will do teraflops, and you claim it
does gigaflops. I guess you know more about their computer than they
do.

You didn't.

I'll bet there are video cards for a Cray. I see no reason to stick

If the computer is so much faster than the regular PC, then the
overhead of the emulation is overwhelmed by the speed of the faster
machine emulating a slower machine. Any moron should be able to
figure that out, even you.

I haven't added anything together.

You said the Cray X1 was only a gigaflop computer,  I proved its a
teraflop machine.
