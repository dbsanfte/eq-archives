Well, it's similar to when you buy a bar of platinum and then combine it with
a gem, and get something like a ring.  I had to use an entire BAR of platinum
to get one measly ring!?  Maybe their bars are like tiny sticks.  Or take two
swatches of silk and make an entire robe... thems is big swatches!

Ok, trade skills don't make a lot of sense, but at least they're tedious and
worthless.  :P
