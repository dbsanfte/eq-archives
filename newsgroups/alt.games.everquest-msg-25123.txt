While I can understand that enough +HP items might make you survive a few
more hits if you're lucky (at low levels anyway, at high levels 300 extra HP
will let you survive about 1 extra round), I still find it hard to believe
that a pure caster could get enough AC to make any noticeable difference to
the damage they take.

Excluding planar and high-end Velious items (most of which are no drop
anyway), the highest AC item I can find on eqprices (which I use for item
searches 'cus the options are nice) is the Insignia Protector which drops
off the Queen in Chardok (AC25, listed price insanely high). Most everything
else you might actually be able to get your hands on is AC15 or a lot lower
(and those are mostly robes). Even if you get the best AC gear you can, your
AC is still going to be pitiful compared to that of even a poorly equipped
melee class (or even non-primary melee, like a shaman). I seem to remember
last time this was discussed here the view was that regardless of how hard
you try, a pure caster's AC is always going to be so awful that you will get
hit for maximum damage nearly every time anyway.

Not especially representative, but for the hell of it: AC from equipment of
a few randomly chosen L35 characters off the player lists on casters realm -
Cleric 122, Warrior 167, Shaman 112, Wizard 55, Enchanter 67 (actually that
was the highest AC of the L30-39 enchanters listed for MT, most were in the
45-50 range).
