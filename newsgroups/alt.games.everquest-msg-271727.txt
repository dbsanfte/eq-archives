Dead simple.  There are far more many people in EQ than in any of the other
games you've listed.  It therefore follows that there are more rude people,
too.

EQ in and of itself doesn't make people rude; they're rude to begin with.
And EQ doesn't draw rude people more than any other game might (in fact, you
might argue the other way, as other games make griefing far more "enjoyable"
than EQ does).

The rude people in EQ are more visible because there are more of them,
that's all.  And actually, with the EQ population in a steep decline of
late, I bet if you went back to it know you'd find far less rude people than
when you left, and virtually no problems of trains, etc.
