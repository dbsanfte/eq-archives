Guess I should have included some reference. Here's his 1/25 post:

"I started EQ when there were 4 servers. I have since convinced 3-5 friends
to join this server but you know what? F Verant and F their retard customer
service. If they think I'm an idiot and will accept their half assed
bullshit then they obviosly can do with one less customer. Thanks for being
a bunch of assholes Verant. If you want to reply then you know where to look
you bunch of special olympics rejects.

-Ian (joined EQ lame crap 1999, done with them in 2002)"
