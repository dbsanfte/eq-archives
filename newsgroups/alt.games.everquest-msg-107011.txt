I'd respond thusly:

a) the idea that Verant can't restrict or prohibit real-life
sales of in-game items is silly, at best. Certainly from a legal
standpoint, this is just waiting for the right lawsuit for Verant
(or some other MM game vendor) to nail down the case law in their
favor. Personally, I agree with them (OF COURSE this falls within
their intellectucal property rights. I mean, duh); but
regardless, the real point is that your proposed service is
doomed to legal abolishment as obviously as Napster always was.

b) that's not to say that Verant _has to_ ban such real-life
trading; whether to do so is really up to them. From a marketing
standpoint I can see it either way. They seem quite clear on what
they choose, though, so how could you guarantee your customers
the stability or safety of your auction market?

c) Even if you don't agree with any of the above and your version
of the legal status is correct, you'll need to provide some
information about your capacity to fight the inevitable legal
battle. Who are your lawyers, what is their expertise and history
winning such cases? How much money will you have on hand to fight
with, and how is that fund secured or bonded?
