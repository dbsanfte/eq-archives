What's sad, Ben Stein really angered me. I always respected him, until
he blamed Sony for causing his sons addiction. You know, maybe poor
parenting skills caused the kid to somewhat withdraw from reality. And
the mother of the guy who blew his brains out, jesus christ...she knew
he was a nut needing to be medicated, said so on the program. and
she's suing? Thank her for the stupid fucking alarm feature now.
