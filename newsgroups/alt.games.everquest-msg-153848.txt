The game's designed for grouping, but if you prefer to solo, more
power to you.

As others have pointed out, the main drawback to soloing is that
if you ever *do* start grouping regularly, the group is going to
suffer for it. The other members will *depend* on you to hold
aggro, and if you're not used to it, somebody who *does*
know how how to do their job and is depending on you to
do yours may die. Don't expect them to be happy about it.

The solution to that particular dilemma is to group at least
occasionally (once every 5 levels or so, say). That will give you
better familiarity with the capabilities of other classes, and the
role of your own class, as the game develops. If you can't do
that much, best that you stick to soloing altogether, or at least
warn people when thinking of joining a group.

Or go play Morrowind. :-) An excellent RPG, of enormous
scope, designed for soloing, and which won't cost a monthly
subscription.
