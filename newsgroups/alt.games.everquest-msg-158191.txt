Ah yes!  I remember my FIRST Bind!  I was so thrilled to be able to do
something for the party in front of me that had just made that suicidal run
all the way across Antonica!

Yeah, I remember this!  These days I toss off Binding and SOW's as a matter
of course, a simple housekeeping chore like picking up the dogs toys...
Thanks for reminding me of how much fun it used to be!

<shrug>  Well, there's a difference between rendering a simple utility spell
that MOST classes in the game have obsolete, and rendering a class defining
ability useless.

Not that I'm going to cry over this, nor quit...  I WILL make my opinion
known though, and discuss it with people.
