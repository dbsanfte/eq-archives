My mom had a ticket for the plane that hit the second tower, but decided 
she'd rather go golfing than go to California.  It was a near thing for 
me, I didn't lose someone I value dearly, but it was a brutal wake up 
call.  

But I'd like to go back to sleep now, it's been a year, ok?  It would be 
nice if I could log into another world for a bit of escapism without 
having 'Oh yeah, reality sucks! NEVER FORGET!' shoved down my throat.

And on that note...

CIHYS?
