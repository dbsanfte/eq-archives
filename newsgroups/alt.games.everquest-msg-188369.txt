If your problem is having to pay for new features, that's always been
the case. Most new features have come as parts of expansions only -
level 60 cap, Velious UI, Velious armor textures, etc, Luclin models,
AA's, so on. One simply can never pass level 50 or do their epic quest
without having at least Kunark. So, the having to pay for new features
is nothing new. It always has been EQ's "direction".
