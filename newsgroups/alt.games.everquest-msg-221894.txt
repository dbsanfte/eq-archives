Q has never been quit. /q was, and (way) earlier, so was /e. /e used to
cause a lot of problems for people who used /r to reply to tells and
missed.

In actual fact, through most of beta, x was attack. It was only moved to
a in beta 4 and beyond. It was also remappable all the way back to beta
4 and I still boggle at people who actually continued to use a for
attack once they found out it could be remapped. Having come from UO,
where you didn't have to hit return to start chatting, the first thing I
did when I started in EQ was remap every significant key off the
alphabetical part of the keyboard so I didn't get unexpected results
when I'd forget to hit enter before trying to talk to people.

Now the worst that can happen is I accidently open my inventory window
when I hit backspace.
