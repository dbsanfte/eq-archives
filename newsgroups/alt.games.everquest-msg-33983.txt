I know that people are giving necromancers a lot of acclaim for soloing, but
are they any good in a group?

I started and Iksar Necro and want to know whether or not I'll be welcome in
a group later on...you don't see a lot of "Lvl 12 necro lfg" messages.

What strategies would I use in a group? I assume I would send my pet in,
DoT, debuff, perhaps fear, and then give mana/health to other players that
needed it...but is that the case?
