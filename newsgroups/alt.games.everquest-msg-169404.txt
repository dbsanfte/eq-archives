When you are teaching languages, it won't show improvement on your skills
list until you log out and back in again.  I had a guildie PL me overnight
while I slept once and he spent all night doing languages for me.  when I
came back to my computer those languages still showed only 2 or 3 skill in
them.  when I in again the next day, not only that language but 4 others
were suddenly mastered.  he mastered me in 6 languages that night and got me
clost to mastering several others.  Tell the guy to log out and in again, he
will see the change;)
