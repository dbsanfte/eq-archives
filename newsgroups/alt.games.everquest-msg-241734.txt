This sounds sooooooooooo familar.  I was in your shoes just before the big
update.

There is a thread on this message board where everyone helped me, but just
in case your server will not get messages that old I will tell you some of
the things that people told me.
1). Make a HOTKEY for your /loc.  That way when you are fighting or close to
death you can get your location.
2). When death is near and you can not win, hit the /loc and DO NOT RUN!
When you run you loose your location.
3). Make friends who can retreive your body.  Not sure of all the different
Classes that can do this, but there are a few.  For some all you have to do
is Group with that class and "BANG" your corpse appears where you are.  For
others you have to be closer. (good thing you /loc)
4). You can get a Chip Bone Rod at most merchants.  This gives you 3 tries
at finding your corpse. (good thing you /loc)
5). Make 2 more HOTKEYS /who corpse  &  /corpse   These will help you find
thearea your corpse is in, and how many you have laying around.

Some clips from my posts on this subject:

Ben, most potion merchants sell a 'chipped bone rod' which will when
cast aim you to face the direction of your corpse. Just start running in
the direction of the body and you will get to it. Careful not to get too
lost, as the rod only has 3 charges on it.

Alternately, you can get a cleric with 'sense undead' or a bard with a
song that does the same thing, or a necro that can actually group with
you and summon your body to you at the edge of the zone.

I personally would recommend the necro if you have the money to buy the
coffin component, as running into the desert may get you killed again if
you dont have your arms and armor. I haven't oplayed my necro baby
lately so i can't remember offhand how much the component costs, but it
is castable by a necro under 20.

at eq.toolbox IIRC they have downloadable maps for all zones, and an
additional little download that puts gridlines across the map. I find it
invaluable for finding things by location.

I think you have a little confusion to the /loc command. This tells
your current location in the zone and not the corpse location. One
good tactic is if you know you are doomed and are all alone, take a
/loc just before you die and jot it down on a piece of paper so when
you get back to the zone, you know where your body will be near.
Learning how to find locations is pretty crucial for many instances -
so its wise to set up a /loc hotkey as well. Some people have problems
finding locations, and its really not hard. What I do is spam myself
with the /loc hotkey and begin to move. Ill rotate myself about until
the numbers start heading in the direction of the location I need to
get to.

However, if you are still under level 10, you dont need to worry about
your body, as you will reappear at your bind point with all of your
equipment.

Also, if you think you are near your body, set up a hotkey with the
/corpse command, this will summon your body to where you are at if you
are very close to it. This will help in case your body fell just under
a hill and you cant quite see it (also good for dragging your body or
anothers with consent to a safer place).

You asked earlier about what to tip necros or someone finding your
body. Necros, Bards and Shadow Knights can cast a spell (or sing a
song for bards) that can point them in the direction of your body if
they are grouped with you. Theres no associated cost with this, but a
little tip of whatever you can afford is considered polite. Be careful
with the bone chipped rods. These are great tools but use them
sparingly. They only have 3 charges I believe and each time you click
to use it, it will use up a charge. If you run out of charges before
you find your body, you've wasted a rod and are back to square one.

Summoning your body is another matter. Necromancers and Shadow Knights
can summon your body with a rather steep cost. Im not sure of the cost
of the coffins for the lesser summon corspe, but the higher level
coffins can cost up to 150 plat (maybe a little bit more).

just go to the zone and do a /w necro or /w bard, and ask them if they
have a couple minutes to help you out. They can both locate and drag
your corpse to a safe spot you can get to, don't need to summon it
really.

Corpse retrieval 101 :)

First, make a hotkey with /loc on it

/hot Location /loc

will do it, and put it in your hotkey bank.

Now, anytime you start getting hit (in a fight, or
just get jumped) hit it.

the numbers are like so:
First number is north south, positive is north
Second number is east west, positive is west

So, if you died at 1000, -2000 and you are currently
at 0, 0 you would run east-northeast to get to your
body.

That, however, doesn't help you right now -

First thing buy a Chipped Bone Rod
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14510

Now, run to the zone you died in, right click
the rod and you will be spun to point at your corpse.

I can't remember exactly where to get these anymore,
but they are sold in Freeport.

Second, you can ask a level 4+ bard, and necro or
a level 9+ shadowknight to help find it, they have
spells/songs that will point them to your corpse.
