Thanks for the post Woland

Allakhazam. Picked up on it yesterday on their update page.  Allakhazam 
declared their position in what I think will be the defining battle over 
whose 'game' is it anyway.

Allakhazam's Update page and comments are below:

Plus they link to a full version of the same post as you link to in 
their forums at:

Me I am going to support "camp 1"

/Rant on

While I will research a problem or quest both inside and outside the 
game. I could be even tempted (When I earn more) to pay for being able 
to research quicker outside the game.

In the end I see the game as a challenge to defeat a foe or find a 
solution to a problem using the tools and equipment that the game 
provides. Living or dying by my decisions.

So far I have reported bugs I've seen and I have yet to find an exploit, 
but would report it if I found it.

I feel those who are willing to pay to directly effect the game through 
dubious means.

I say dubious as currently I don't know of any laws about theft of money 
from a game and selling it for real money.

Should have their accounts banned and be blacklisted from all future 
games.

I agree that if an obvious Cheat is discovered it should be reported at 
once.

A friend of mines son proudly showed me a cheat for MS Age of Empire 
series that he had got from a magazine

It let loose an "AC Cobra" car with a super-cannon that reduced the 
Viking computer opposition to smoking pixels

I was amazed that Microsoft would even write such a blatant cheat into 
the game.

I want to be entertained and have my grey matter exercised. Unless the 
coding is so up the creek a game will have a solution that is possible 
using the available tools. To use cheats and hacks defeats for me the 
whole purpose of playing.

So to get back onto track.

I joined EQ because it seemed to be hack / exploit / cheat proof.

If SOE doesn't do something about this. If it gets to seriously effect 
my attempts to play properly then just like Unreal Tournament (Automated 
macros that allowed online players to kill as people spawned or never 
miss with any weapon)  I'll vote with my feet and leave.
