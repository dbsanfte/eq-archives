Real life cropped up a few months ago, so I ended up taking a several
month break from EQ.  Since I've come back I've noticed a drastic
difference.  Yesterday I ended up with some time off work, so I was
playing in the middle of the day for once and for the life of me I
couldn't find a group.  Several times I was the only one in FM.  And
there was one group in OT, however, they had a full group, so I couldn't
get into it.  This is not me predicting the downfall of EQ.  I was just
trying to figure out why.  Here are the possible reasons I could come up
with.

1. EQ numbers just aren't what they used to be.

2. So many people have gotten into higher levels that there are very few
<  50 characters out there.

3. Since, PoP has come out, more people are focusing on their higher
level characters, and will return to some of their alts when the newness
wears off.

4. People were just out messing around with the halloween events, rather
than focusing on the grind that day, so it was just an aberration.


Personally, I would love to do a good dungeon crawl rather than these
outside zones anyway, but it's hard to find a group that knows what it's
doing.
