Why is that ugly? When was the United States voted world cop? Why should 
we be held accountable for other goverments actions? I'm an "ugly 
American" because I don't want us so involved in world affairs that we 
are held accountable for someone else's actions?? WHY THE HELL SHOULD I 
PAY TO FEED AND CLOTHE SOMEONE WHO'S ONLY AIM IN LIFE IS TO KILL MY 
FELLOW COUNTRYMEN?? Do you have ANY idea how much money the United 
States doles out in "world welfare"?? Well then YES count me ugly. I'll 
be proud to wear that moniker.
