Eastern Wastes,Bodyguards are level 50,have around 10k hps,
and hit for max 80.
Root/dotting with my 55 Druid I get 1 blue in 30 minutes,not the
best xp I know,and I only suggest this cause you said you
try to avoid PoP and Ldon.
Maybe you can kill them faster with a Necro fearkiting,unsure
about that.

I do them(of course not exclusively) cause loot is not that bad,
they drop Coldain heads,going price for one is 50p,and as a
foraging class I get Tufts of dire wolf fur too.
Oh,and they do *not* give faction hits.
