Well, he did say that there had to be a valid reason.  Here in the US, a 
business person can legally decide that he does not want to do business 
with you because you are wearing a red shirt, or because he just doesn't 
feel like it (so long as he is not discriminating based on race, 
religion, gender, age (with some exceptions), disability, (did I miss 
any?)).  If you break a dress code, or become a nuisance, then I would 
gather that it is OK to boot you even in Italy.
