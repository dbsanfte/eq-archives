My theory on lack of Iksar armor quests is that Iksars are the only
necromancer  race with natural regeneration.  This means that ones you
get "Dark Pact" at level 8, you almost have permanent Clarity without
any loss of life.  All other races lose quite a bit of HP's during
Dark Pact and have to Lifetap or rest to heal.  Quite an advantage!

As for money-making, get out of Kunark (easy with PoK) and head almost
anywhere, but I would suggest Paineel, even at level one!  You have to
run past the guards to the newbie field, but they take about 5 seconds
to aggro, so don't hang out around them.  Kill lots of rats for the
groovy Plague Rat Tails, which sell for almost 2 pp, and save the meat
for sandwiches.  Also there are tons of skeletons everywhere for
beaucoups bone chips.  At level 5 or 6, go into the Warrens for tons
of XP and bitchin' loot (throw out the Kobold Molars for now, unless
you have massive storage space -- mule, anyone?}.

  It'll take about 3 million kills, but you'll be amiable to the
guards of Paineel, with a new place to trade!  Now you are able to
turn in those Kobold Molars for even better loot and XP!  You'll even
be tolerated somewhat in Erudin, at least enough to get through town
if you wish.

One of the biggest pains with Iksars is finding places to shop, so any
new faction is good!  

If you can't quest for armor, then buy the good stuff in the Bazaar!

P.S.  It used to be good to level up to five in Toxullia Forest, but
now the Kobolds there don't have any faction, but there are rare
Kobolds in the Paineel newbie field to at least get you started on
your amiable status.
