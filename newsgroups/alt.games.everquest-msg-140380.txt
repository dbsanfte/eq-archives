Since I had a petition refused for the name, Iamthehealer I have since taken
to just ignoring the presence of people with, what I consider, inappropriate
names. The other day I offered an explaination to a player of why I wouldn't
heal him.
When I mentioned roleplaying his response was similar, go to the Roleplay
server then.
Mine, to such comments, will always be the same, Nope I can roleplay here
just fine, it's not me that is losing out.
If they set up a roleplay encouraged server but with normal rules I'd take
that split. FV was not around when I first started playing and I am certain
I could not get a transfer there, with equipment.
