Not really.  I saw people selling items for less than mine last night, 
but that didn't make me change my prices.  Once somebody buys the lower-
priced one, mine is back in the race.  Meanwhile, I'm off doing 
something else without having to worry about missing a "wtb ___" shout.  
Which is, basically, exactly what Dan was saying.
