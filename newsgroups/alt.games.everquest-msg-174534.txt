Hmm, one shouldnt be able to chain cast that fast are you sure you did nt
aggro others? Also you do have to think about dark blues....when you get
high enough a DB one level below you can give you serious trouble...when
its formidible they really can mean it.

AAAaaah...this question...as I understand it the con refers to the level
of the mob solely and makes no adjustments for any special abilites above
and beyond the norm for that sort of mob....this is referred to the mob
being an undercon. Some mobs are famous for being undercons Kizdean Gix,
Dorn in NRo etc - usually for having some poweful ability (Kizdean has his
Harm touch and SK spells)

Treant - con it and see whether it likes you or not - dont assume then all
walking trees like you as they an be withered or corrupted...
