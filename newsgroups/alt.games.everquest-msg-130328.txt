WOW! Hold the phone! The OP should NOT take all this at face value. I
dont' normally answer top posters, but with this much inaccurate stuff
being tossed out, let's go through the list.

Perhaps that explains the differences, but I seem to think it works the
same for monks as necros and SKs (assuming the spell is successful) and
it's NOT how you have it laid out.

Incorrect. FD *will* work, but you *must* remain feigned over the course
of the dots. I've done it with my necro many times. If you succeed in FD
with dots on the mob, and stand back up, after the dot fires again you
reaggro. But if you stay down in your feign till the dots wear off,
you're fine.

Well, swings happen virtually instantaneously, so that's not an issue,
but yes. If a cast has begun and hits you after you FD, it will break FD
and you'll be attacked.
 
> FD will fail if you have a pet attacking the mob

Incorrect. You can FD while a pet is attacking just fine. However, if
you stay FD'd too long, your pet will poof. (Unless that was changed in
a recent patch.) But the FD still holds and you're fine in terms of the
mob attacking you.
 
> FD will fail if you are caught in the range of an AOE

Varies from situation to situation, but something to be cautious of,
yes.

Not sure on that one. I usually solo'd. Anyone? Anyone? Beauller?
 
> I have also heard some mobs can't be fooled

I've heard that too, though I never met one that wasn't a result of one
of the many VI bugs in FD that keep cropping up. However, beyond a
certain level (35?) mobs get a much better chance to "remember" you
after you stand up from an FD and not have you cleared off the hate
list.

On to the Original Poster's questions.

See above. It will work, but if you stand up while the DoTs are running,
it's another attack and you're back on the hate list. This applies to
your Engulfing Darkness line, but only because it contains a damage DoT
component. If it were a regular snare with no DoT, it wouldn't affect
FD. Same for debuffs, etc. If no new damage is being applied to the mob
each tick by the spell, you're fine.

This is not true at all. If FD succeeds, any NPC's in the area who are
fooled will simply think you are dead and ignore you and drop you off
their hate list (assuming you were on it or are KOS to them.)

Hope that helps.
