Already did that...she was killed by her own kind, but her actions in
life prompted several of the gods to decide she was worthy of a "real"
chance at life, so they took her from Innoruuk and reincarnated her
into a half elf who happened to take up schooling in the ways of a
druid. ;-)

The "good dark elf" routine can be good when done right with a solid
background to it... It's no worse than the "evil high elf" routine,
after all.

( I also have the "half dark elf bard follower of Tunare whose daddy
is trying to turn him to the dark side" routine going on another
character. ;-) )
