Yes, but DT says that making this comment is equivalent to asking
for a lower fail rate.

I disagree with that viewpoint, it could also be asking for a
higher "trivial" point, so that you continue to learn (even if at
a much slower pace) until the fail rate is much lower.

Or it could just be a comment on the innate silliness of the
system, without any request for redress at all, sort of a "howl
at the moon"
