Obviously, you must live under a rock.  You mean to tell me that you and
your friends have never jumped to the conclusion that a guy was gay/woman
was lesbian based on little more than the way he/she looked and moved?  If
you  can honestly claim that, you are better than the students at our local
high school who have already decided that one of their fellow students is
gay based solely on the way he moves and talks (not what he talks about, but
how he talks).  There has never been a hint of him having a relationship
with another male, but as far as they're concerned he's gay and he's a prime
target for someone who hates gays.

Oh boy, you mean to say you've never heard the term "hate laws" or to be
more specific "hate crime laws" before?  It's simply the term used for the
laws relating to attacks on specific people -- be they gay, Afro-American,
native, Jewish, Catholics etc. -- just because they happen to belong to said
groups.  It's got nothing to do with "legislating human attraction" as you
put it -- other than if you hate gays and go out of your way to kill someone
who's gay it can be classified as a "hate crime".  You're free to hate
whomever you wish to hate -- you're  just not free to assault them or torch
their home because of your feelings.
