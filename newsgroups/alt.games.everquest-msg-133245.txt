No idea about the rest but buffed AC doesn't vary;  it's not
raw AC, but "final" AC.  So, at least, the "+sum of buffs"
should be moved to outside the formula.  Or at least that's
my experience.

> Third, is the cleric line of AC buffs at all worthwhile?

On the tank(s), yes, assuming they aren't at or above the soft
cap. On the cleric, probably, assuming they've paid any attention
at all to having *reasonable* AC.  It's reasonably useless on
everyone else.

Nope, and it doesn't even help the enchanter.  Their AC is too low
even WITH the buff to make a difference.  AC doesn't matter below
a certain point;  you're still going to get hit for max.  And it
doesn't matter above a certain point as much either; diminishing
returns kick in.  Within that range, though, somewhere between robe
wearer's AC and the soft caps, it makes a tremendous difference.

Ask the next level 60 warrior you see if he'll trade out any piece
of armor he has for one with the exact same stats but another 30 AC...
Until they hit the soft cap, AC > all for tanks.   Enchanters, wizards,
etc. are all going to drop if they get and maintain aggro for a few
rounds;  the object there is to make sure they either don't get aggro
or they don't have it for long.   Tanks, however, have to get hit and
AC is pretty much the only thing that let's a healer keep them on their
feet.
