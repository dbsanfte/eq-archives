For the purpose of online relationships, where the man cannot hear the woman
and gauge her reactions in person, it would help for a little more
directness, to say the least.

I was given this from her, "I do want you in my world, and not just in game,
but I dont want this to be a hard thing for you to do."

In woman-speak...I want you to listen to my problems, feel remorse and
concern for my affairs, but at the same time I won't even engage you in a 2
minute /tell conversation the few times you greet me hello.

Yeah, she's a nice one.  /wink
