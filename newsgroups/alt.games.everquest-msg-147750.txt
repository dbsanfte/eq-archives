He is on AB. I've also said via email that I'll help him get his corpse
too so now he has two options...

Best advice to the original poster is to consider joining a good guild.
Generally someone in a guild will drop what they are doing and go
help you out when things like this happen.

And also to say that petition probably would work eventually. I recently
fell in
the chasm in karana just out of HHK due to an enormous amount of lag.
And couldn't get to my corpse or even see it. And I'm level 36 so I couldn't
use the
summon corpse spell I've got to find it.

They answered my petition and got my corpse back although it took about
4 hours for them to get to me.
