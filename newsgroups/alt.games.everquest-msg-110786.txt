    I'm the last person to try an exploit - I still refuse to camp the
corner in SG instead of run across, for example. My understanding was the
same as Dude's - our guild druid casts Harmony on Sontalak, and we can
squeeze by because of the lowered aggro radius. He doesn't really move
around before you cast that, so I'm not sure where the "roots" part comes
from. Can you elaborate? I wouldn't want to do it if it wasn't legit.
