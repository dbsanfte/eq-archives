Looking my direction and seeing that I have a suit and a watch on, is not a
problem.  Reaching out, grabbing my hand to see if I am wearing a Rolex
(uber loot) or a Ralex (rusty loot) IS a problem.  Just as it would be a
problem if they reached in my coat to see if it's Armani or Sears.  Now, if
you ASKED me what type of watch it is, or if you ASKED me where I got my
suit, I'd tell you.

Asking is just common courtesy.  But, I guess, if you don't have any common
courtesy in real life, you'd have no idea how to bring it into a community
based game.

And yes, it is Ostrich Syndrome.  If I see that you are inspecting me, I get
upset.  If I don't know that you are inspecting me, you are bothering me in
no way.  (Ostrich head in the sand).  So, before you call my references or
analogies absurd, perhaps you should know what they mean first ... unless
you are simply TRYING to be argumentative, in which case I'll point you to
my common courtesy statement above.
