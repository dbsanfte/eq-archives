I can tell you I have the same issue, both with the game freezing 5
seconds while it saves and a total lock (no mouse, no keyboard, have
to hold power button to reset it.)  I have tried updating my bios, my
video drivers, my soundcard drivers, directx, 4in1 drivers.  Nothing
has worked that way.  I have disabled Norton Antivirus and closed all
programs that start and same issue.  I too have a Sound Blaster live
series (i think is the culpret) but different system other then that.
