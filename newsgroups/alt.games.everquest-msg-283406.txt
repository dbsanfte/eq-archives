Probably has a lot to do with the fact that you are on FV, so there is
a lot more available tradable FT items.

Doesn't seem odd at all to me, augs you can move as you upgrade
equipment.

Without AAs, the cap is 15 mana regen from items plus tribute.  With
AAs you can boost that to 20 mana regen from items plus tribute. 
(Tribute mana regen counts the same as item mana regen).
