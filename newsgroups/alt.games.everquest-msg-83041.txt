If you then turn through that arc again does it do the same thing again 
or does it get better?  If it's better the second time around it's 
likely related to either swapping or loading something (textures maybe?)

I had this kind of problem in parts of Velious and fixed it by adding 
more RAM.  But the problem pretty much went away when I went to 384Mb 
(had 128 before, this was before Luclin).

Now after Luclin I'm at 768Mb and I don't have the drive crunching a 
lot, but I do have lag in those areas, and I believe it's video lag (or 
processor) related to the Luclin graphics engine problems.  Of course I 
upgraded to W2k since then too, and I believe it may handle swap a bit 
differently.

Have you tried turning off all the graphics options and adding the 
UseUmbra=False line?  It helped quite a bit for me, but then I took it 
out again so I could see at least a little in foggy zones.

When you exit EQ does the drive crunch quite a bit loading windows stuff 
back in when you hit the start button?  For me that was the clincher 
that I didn't have enough RAM, though as you say 512Mb should be enough 
(assuming you don't have too many models turned on, etc).
