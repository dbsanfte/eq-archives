This happens now... if your character is running when he goes
LD he keeps running in a straight line till something stops him.
I've had to do some pretty fancy CRs for people, a good reason
to carry chipped bone rods as a cleric, and to have one
in the bank so you can do your -own- locating if you don't happen
to be a necro, bard or (I think?) SK

Difference with the suggested plan would be that your character
would path to the nearest zone, instead of just running straight.
