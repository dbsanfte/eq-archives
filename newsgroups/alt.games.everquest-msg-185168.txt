And the golden rule is keep a spare - keyboards are almost throwaway items
anyway. If you have a spare you are not going into withdrawls waiting for
the "washed" one to dry... or be tempted to use it when it could still has
water in it.

I always leave a washed keyboard somewhere for a week or so to be completely
certain it *is* fully dry.
