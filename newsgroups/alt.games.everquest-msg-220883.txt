    That hits the nail on the head for me. I'm definitely the roleplaying
kind but the game "story" isn't worth reading [why NPC's don't just *Talk*
is beyond me, how very nonimmersive], and you can't really participate in it
since nothing changes. I find peoples descriptions of their characters as
their "toon" to be fairly appropriate since EQ is basically a medieval
fantasy first person simulator with a comedy-epic theme.

    And yeah, the complete moral bankruptcy of the faction system only adds
to the comedy factor. You can cold bloodedly murder 2-3 guards in freeport
before anyone considers bringing you to justice. Firiona Vie paladins will
*love* my necromancy practising, serial mass murderer shadowknight if I kill
enough things they hate and provide grisly evidence that I have done so.

    I did consider starting a character on the FV server but the "only
having one character" thing struck me as a completely unnecessary
restriction for a newbie at the time, and I had friends on Povar.
