Thank you, it's a testament to the power of this character generator that
one can express a character concept so easily. My first char (my main) looks
like a dufus because, well, it was my first attempt. The first time I was so
eager to get in game and my character concept so unformed in my mind that I
didn't really wind up with a look that I'm crazy about, although he does
look like a Super Hero in flashy red and yellow tights and wings on this
head, LOL!
