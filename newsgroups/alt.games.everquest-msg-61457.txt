Pro is a superset of Home, so aside from it costing more, there is no
disadvantage to getting Pro.  Basically, Home is missing some
features, and some of the defaults are different.  Here's a
comparison:

http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/windowsxp_home_pro.asp

Also look at the feature lists at www.microsoft.com.  Keep in mind
when looking at those lists that Pro is a superset of Home, so if you
see something listed with Home you really want, and don't see it
listed with Pro, that's OK.

Here's a quick list of what Pro has that Home doesn't.  If you need or
want anything from this list, get Pro.  Otherwise, save $100 and get
Home.

1. Remote Desktop.  Let's you access your XP desktop from any version
of Windows that supports Terminal Services Client (e.g., Win 98).
Note that Home *does* support Remote Assistance, which is something
that allows tech support people to connect to your desktop for
troubleshooting.

2. Multiprocessor support.  Pro supports up to two CPUs.

3. Backup and ASR.  Home does *not* have a backup utilitity.  ASR is
"Automatic System Recovery", which lets you completely recover the
system from a backup (e.g., hard disk dies...but in new one, and
restore from backup).

4. Dynamic Disks and Logical Volume Manager are Pro only.

5. Integrated FAX support is not included by default in Home.  It's on
the CD.

6. IIS.  Note that they've dropped Personal Web Server, so that Home
comes with no web serving software.  If you have a burning need to
have your system compromised, you'll need to get Pro.  (If you want to
serve web pages...get Apache (www.apache.org).  The Windows version
should work fine on XP Home, and it's a better server than IIS).

7. Encrypted File System.  Pro let's you specify that files or folders
should be encrypted on the disk.

8. File-level access control.

9. Microsoft is not going to submit Home for C2 certification.  You
don't care about this.

10. Only Pro can join a Windows domain.  Home is like 9x on a Windows
network.  All the things that require domain membership are missing
from Home.

11. All the change and configuration management stuff that falls under
IntelliMirror.

12. Multi-language support.  I'm a little unclear on just what this
means, since the feature list at www.microsoft.com does say Home
supports multiple input methods so you can input other languages, and
that it supports other languages for apps.  This might just mean that
you can't switch the language that the system is using on Home.  On
Pro, I believe you can say "Gosh darn, I'm tired of this English
stuff...I feel like seeing everything in German", and basically switch
to the German version of XP Pro on the fly.

13. No 64-bit version.  If you are getting an Itanium, you have to get
Pro.

14. A bunch of network stuff: IPSec, SNMP, Simple TCP/IP services, SAP
Agent, Netware client, Network Monitor.

15. Different settings for what's in the Start menu, caching, and
stuff like that.

16. This doesn't matter to you, since you are getting it with a new
system, but for people upgrading, Home can upgrade from 98, 98SE, and
Me.  Pro can upgrade from those, NT 4.0 Workstation, and Win2K Pro.
