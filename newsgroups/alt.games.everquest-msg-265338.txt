Not that much different from any other mmog experience. Most people make 
occasional mistakes and no one holds it against them. Some people gain 
reputations for being morons and will get shunned. But like Mark says, it's 
a huge community and mostly nobody tracks that kind of thing and pickup 
groups are still a major institution. I do have one or two on my ignore 
list, but these guys were really special case ...
