I was checking "who all 61" yesterday, before many stores had PoP in stock.
It seems that somehow the 2 uber guilds
on my server each had 90% of their players in PoP already and lvl 61. When I
looked specifically at the 2nd tier guilds , some who have as many players
as the more powerful guilds, very few were in PoP , or lvl 61. Was there
some guarenteed way of getting PoP Monday? I paid in full for it weeks ago,
and still wont get my copy till Tues.  It seems more than a coincidence that
all these players in same guilds got it "early" and few others did.
