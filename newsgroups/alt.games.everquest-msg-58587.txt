One might Torpor a caster for a heal.  One DOES Torpor the mob
for the attack speed and movement effects.  A mob that's hitting
30% less often throughout a fight is doing 30% less possible damage.
That 30% less damage, combined with the other abilities (HP buffs,
regen, etc), is enough to negate the need for a cleric in XP groups
at that level.
