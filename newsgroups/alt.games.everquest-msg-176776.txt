Speaking from the viewpoint of a shaman here, snare is not necessary,
although it sure makes life easier.  I pull with Malosini, then run far
enough ahead to get a root off.  You could do the same with a snare, if
fizzled or resisted, run some more.  After that, life gets easier, I slow
the mob, and then DoT it.  Once it's slowed, even if it catches up to me, I
can reroot between hits.  Shaman, of course, get none of the above, except
for the unresistable debuff, at level 60, assuming you have 60k+ to toss
around for a copy of Malo, or are in a guild that can take down the mobs
that drop it, and get lucky.
