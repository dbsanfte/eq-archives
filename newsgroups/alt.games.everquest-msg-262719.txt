Ah... but here you commit a fundamental error.

Buying it is not actually an a sanctioned option. Buying gear in EQ is 
equivalent to running out of money in monopoly, heading over to ToyRUs 
and buying a package of 10k monopoly money for 1.99USD.

You are in a distinct minority.

Sure it does. In many distinct ways:

The vast majority of the playerbase raids and selects where they go to 
hunt based on potential rewards. The primary reward in EQ is items. If 
they can buy the items they don't need to engage the content... and will 
rapidly find it boring to engage content with no reward. They will quit. 
EQ will die. An then the 20 people like you who think playing is its own 
reward will have the world to yourself until Sony yanks the plug on the 
profitless game.

A large number of people rate their performance according to what they 
have accomplished in EQ in terms of gear, items, levels, etc. These 
people will be so disgusted that any asshat with a few bucks can surpass 
them that they'll leave the game. That's bad the health of the game's 
finances... a *lot* of people would quit if the Time+ gear they spent 
months earning could be purchased for a few bucks by a clueless newbie.

If you can buy any item (including the epics, per the argument at hand) 
guilds will not bother to progress through zones to earn them. They will 
simply buy them, roll around in a few zones discovering that the drops 
are inferior to what they bought, get bored and quit. This is bad for 
the economic health of the game.
