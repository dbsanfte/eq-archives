-- I have a 23 Level Barbarian Shaman that I started way back in 2000,
left EQ for awhile and now am working on levelling up.  When I first
rolled him, I put too many pts into Strength, thinking that would help
with Soloing, on the advice of a friend.  Of course, I learned later
that I should have put more pts into Wisdom for spells or Stamina for
hitpoints.  So now I look for gear that gives me pts for Wisdom
primarily and AC secondarily.  I enjoy playing a Barbarian, I don't
think I'd change that.  Back in the days before PoP and Luclin it was
a bit of a pain getting around but that added to the challenge and the
fun.  I also have an Iksar Shaman I made as a throwaway character but
don't plan on doing anything with him.

-Robert.
