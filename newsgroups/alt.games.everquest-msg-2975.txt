I play all classes of characters Healers, Casters and Tanks in one form or
another. Tanks have a responsibleity to Taunt from the begining of fight
some tanks belive they only have to taunt when someone is in trouble.
Healers have to be carefull not to overheal as stupid as it sounds at the
start of a fight I have seen healers start overhealing when the tank drops a
bub of health and wonder why the mob argos on them. If DOTing dont stack
DOTs 1 right after another let the tank do his job. Finally a heavy Nuker
should even cast a spell till the mob is at half life, this is the main
reason Wizards have such a hard time finding groups they cast too early and
dont know how to play the class also inexperieced players feel the wizard is
just loafing when he does his job properly. Also on a side note I like to
assign the backup healer if possible the job of watching the Nuker or
primary healers health.
This tactic works real good also helps pulling the mob off of the weaker
character.
