I am training my piercing in OT right now, i play a necro and shure he is only
lvl 25, but mobs have a tendency to move back and forth when low on health so
i can get good piercing skill here :) not shure if my other skills go up as 
much but that's where resists help up, getting smacked by a kunark rhino a few 
times help :)
