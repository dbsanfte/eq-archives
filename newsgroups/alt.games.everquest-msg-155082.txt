It's random, but that's because the mob does periodic checks to see if charm
breaks.  Your CHA has an effect on whether or not charm breaks.  I've
noticed that my charms tend to last a LOT longer with a high CHA - once I
got it over 200, it became a little more reliable, and at 255, I can usually
keep something charmed for several minutes.  But it will still sometimes
fail after a few seconds.

So to answer the original question, yes, you can get your CHA up through
items so that your charm lasts longer.  But you're a druid - getting your
CHA up will probably mean taking hits in other stats that are far more
important, like WIS.

I wouldn't worry about it.
