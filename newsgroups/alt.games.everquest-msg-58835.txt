 Technically it's called Harm Touch. Deathtouch as a skill would be nice
though. Insta 20k damage. 2 SKs could take out Phara Dar in .63 seconds
heh. 

 SKs get summon corpse at level 51. (Once they locate and scribe the
spell of course)

 Also the darkness line is good if you don't have a druid (or wizard of
the appropriate level) to snare mobs.

 Mend heals 20%. Also most monks (not all though. bad monks!) religously
practice Bind Wound and carry bandages along with them. You can bandage
up to 50%. The ability to bandage to 70% happens at level 51 once your
skill gets to 201. This usually makes for good downtime healing
especially if regen is available.
