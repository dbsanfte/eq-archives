Step One:  Don't Solo That Camp.

Without the ability to feign death, you're not going to be able to
single-pull the camp without some sort of assistance.  If you want to solo
you're going to have to have the "Lull" line of spells, and you're going to
have to hope it's not resisted, because that really ticks them off.
Paladins aren't made for pulling, nor are they made for soloing.

By far the best outdoors pull tool (even better than a monk) is Harmony, a
level 9 (IIRC) druid spell...I assume rangers get it at 22, but I'm too lazy
to look.

Enchanters can deal with overpulls, as can a 15 bard to some extent.
