Then you made a reply as if Bill was suggesting that rezzing the dead is
unprofitable because the dead are naked... when if you hadn't snipped, it was
pretty clear that he was saying casting KEI on the live people running back
into the dungeons where their dead bodies and the rest of their adventure
awaits would be unprofitable.
