Back when they first started allowing force eat/drinking, they
outright said that you didn't get the same nourishment from doing so.
Not sure if I missed what you were saying, but, yes, you do go through
food/drink faster force-eating/drinking.

However, I can say with almost complete confidence that autoattack has
zero impact on consumption rates.
