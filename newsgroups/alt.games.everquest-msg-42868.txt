Making an illegitimate claim like that would be absurd.   His life depends
primarily upon people who would have been involved in the resistance.
He's not a nobody that would have gone unnoticed within the resistance
and only come to prominence later:   word of a Saudi millionaire fighting
the Soviets would spread like wildfire among the resistance.

While it's highly doubtful that he was a front-line soldier in the Afghan
resistance (at least on a regular basis), claims that he wasn't involved
at all just aren't believable.   He lives among people that would KNOW
the difference.   The fact that they not only allow him to continue to do
so but also protect and shelter him convinces me that it's true.
