Small nitpick on the EULA argument here.  I think the EULA is not so much of
a legal lever here since Yantis is not using his account to produce the pp.
He *could* totally quit the game and still trade in pp's and then what
affect would the EULA have?  Sony can ban him, but otherwise I don't think
that EULA has the value of the paper it's printed on, outside the game.
