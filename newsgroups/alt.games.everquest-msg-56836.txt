Then you'll need one or both of Soldiers of Tunare and Faydark's
Champions.

FD is easy - hit Crushbone and lay waste to the zone. Specifically the
named pops like Crush himself.

Soldiers of Tunare is much, much harder, as there are no mobs that I know
of (and confirmed somewhat by Allakhazams) that killing will raise this
faction - it's almost entirely quest based. Good 'ol catch-22. You can
kill maybe do the Orc Runner quest and turn in the goodies to the Pally
guild in Felwith (instead of the ranger guild in Kelethin) to raise
faction. The trick is finding a quest where the pay-off NPC is not already
KOS to you.

Good luck, and may you serve as a reminder to other Tunare followers -
don't go on PoG raids.
