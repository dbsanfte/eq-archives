In mid-May, 2005, we advised you via email, patch message and website 
announcement that the EverQuest subscription rates would be increasing in 
June, 2005.  We announced that the new pricing would be:

1 Month:        $14.99
3 Month:        $41.97
6 Month:        $77.94
12 Month:      $143.88

Due to a billing error, SOE undercharged you on any subscription cycles that 
were processed since the new pricing went into effect.  Accordingly, SOE 
will be processing a one-time additional charge to your credit card for the 
difference.  This small additional charge will appear on your next credit 
card statement.

Thank you for your understanding; we sincerely apologize for our error.  If 
you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact customer 
service.
