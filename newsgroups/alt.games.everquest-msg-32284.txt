I have been a regular on Everquest for over 12 months now, and I have
several characters on the go (see below for details), all of whom reside on
the Morell-Thule server. I live in England, and find that most of the large
guilds are often on US time, whether it's east or west coast. That restricts
my involvement in guild activities, my main hours are Monday-Thursday 6pm to
11pm, and most of the day at the weekends.

I am searching for a guild that has the majority of members on British or
Western European time. It doesn't have to be a large guild, or have many
high level players, because I know these will develop over time. The main
thing is that I need people who will be playing at the same kind of times as
me, and not people who I see on rare occasions because one of us is playing
out of our usual hours.

If you think you have a guild that would fit this description, and you would
be prepared to enrol my characters, then please reply to this post or
contact me in game. Many thanks in advance.
