I should have said mid level.  30 - 45 .  Lets see. THe just took 2 great
area's away from us at this level, Mines of Nugra and Temple of Dogra.
These where fun crawls, and the only exceptable place to get chardok
faction.  So now when a player needs Chardok faction they are going to have
to kill 2800 level 50+ goblins rather than have to go after Level 30+.

Now for what your rebuttle is going to be,  " they gave you LoY for this
level range"  Have you been there?  I was there with a good group of 40 -
55, and we got stomped once we got away from the yard trash mobs.  Are there
still area's for this level to grow?  Yes there are, but a lot of what is
left are the areas that noone wanted to go to before because of bad pathing,
underconning mobs, huge trains, or unaceptable faction hits, overpowered
magic users.

As for your "What changes are you talking about that made low levels harder,
prior to this change to group buffs?"
 If you remeber about 4 -6 mounths ago they made casting mobs use stronger
spell, "more in tune with there level".  I wonder if that was caused by the
fact that a group of 6 uber buffed characters could take down a lvl 50
chanter  when they where all around 35 - 40.  Also what I was saying before,
that they are constantly raising the bar for good content.  SoE is making
more and more content for the power gamers at the coust of the casual gamer.
They just nerfed the drobs in LoY because they where overpowered for the
encounter.  Quite a few of those items on a dificulty level would come form
level 20 - 30 characters now.  Case in point Zraxthril Forged Flamberge Was
9/28, now 9/35.  This was done because it was to good of a drop from a level
50 - 55 mob that had 5500+HP, hits for 120 - 150,  and always comes in
pairs.

I will agrea that they made the first 10 levels menial.  They should have to
do courpse runns from level 5 on.  However, is not taking XP away from a
level 9 character hurting your play in any way? They do learn that death
hurts before they get to the grouping levels, so they should have the "don't
want to die" leason etched in there brains.   As for the other Improvments
to the lower levels, they simply make learning the interface, and
interactions easyier for first timers.  I personaly think they should have
never added the "do you realy want to attack this red NPC" adition. It goes
away at 10 when all the other changes happen, and we are left with a lvl 10
charcter that has no idea where ther courps is or why that gaurd just killed
than.

IF you are an old timer, then get over it.  None of this effects you.  You
should have a level 65 character with 400 AA by now.  Oh Wait you couldn't
you spend tomuch time here flamming everyone to actualy play.


NOW BACK TO WHAT THIS POST WAS ABOUT.  It was supose to be a poke at all the
KEI adicks.    I for one having characters under and over 45, and plan on
makeing the pest of what I have.  Did i use these buffs when available.
Hell yeah.  I had Eago, KEI, POT9, Boar, and a couple of others on everytime
I went on a raid, or xp outing.  I used it while it lasted, and let the
healers know when they fayded.  I was the MA a lot and as a SK I would use
my agro spells a lot, so I would run my mana down as fast as the nukers to
keep agro.  Are we going to have to ADAPT to the new situation. Yep.  those
that don't will never learn there characters strengths and weaknesses, and
fail to move on with the rest of there group. This is the basis of the
"Peter Principle" whitch states. "in a hierarchically structured
administration(Guild or Group), people tend to be promoted up to their level
of incompetence".  A character that may have been great with all the extra
buffes before may not know how to play with what there are given now.  The
group may pull them through a level or two, but sooner or later they will
see that what was a great asset to the group is now just dead weight, and
will find someone else that can fill the role.
