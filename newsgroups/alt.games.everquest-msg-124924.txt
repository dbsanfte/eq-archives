Six 3 ring binders:  
1-3: Maps (alpha/zone): A - I, J - Q, R - Z
4: Pricing by class
5: Luclin maps (Put it in it's own binder... wish I'd have done that with all
the maps, separated by Kunark, Antontica... etc... then alpha, will probably
take the time to do that someday)
6: Tradeskills, (between my BF and myself we do smithing, baking, fletching,
jewelry, sewing, pottery, and alchemy.  Everything but brewing and tinkering. 
)
7: Class specific info and quests
