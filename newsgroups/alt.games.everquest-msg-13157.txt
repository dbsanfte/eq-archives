    Aye, but I don't think they'd fall for it the SECOND time you Feigned
Death while setting up your ambush. Or the third, fourth, or however many
times the average monk FDs to get a proper split. The game engine, however,
cannot make the distinction of second, third, fourth attempt at FD. That's
why it's not "RP".

    I get the idea many of these go hand in hand. They imagine a world
"working" one way, and when the players do it another they can't justify it
within their narrow "RP" framework. Reading those comments by Kendrick was
pretty chilling - um, Kendrick, people in EQ kill the same thing over and
over, and even switch factions for personal gain, all the time.

    Verant has always been clear on this, so I don't know why you aren't. If
you're using world geometry in a way that "doesn't make sense", then it's an
exploit. If you moving one step makes the mob run all the way around the
room again to get to you, it's an exploit - the "real life" mob wouldn't do
this. If the Avatar of CT can't run past a line in a room to get at you if
you stand in the right spot, it's an exploit - why would the "real" Avatar
stop moving?

    It's an exploit because it stops spell effects that they feel SHOULD
nail people in the different atmosphere, but doesn't because of coding.

    Reliably pissed off the enemy, sure. But the "ignoring" part is where
you get problems. Why would a Warder NOT go kill these newly-ressed folks,
or NOT just summon/stroll under the bridge and pound stuff flat? (I don't
disagree with using CotH to clear aggro - VI made specific arrangements to
have it do just that when they briefly broke it.)

    And here, we differ. You've been TOLD not to exploit, and yet as soon as
you find an aspect of the game engine that clearly isn't as intended, you
use it to advantage? Hmm - summoning is to prevent people from being in
risk-free locations vs. summoners. Yet if I stand HERE, I'm risk-free vs.
summoners. Exploit? Do I need to be a genius?

    As for fixing it, I'm sure we'll get a ton of "fixes" out of this, and
all the problems that go with the "fixes".

    (b) is exploiting. Why is that tough?

    I do wonder about this reason given by VI, though. I've (obviously)
never been in ST - is there a place under the bridge where the clerics were
abusing the air/water boundary? The only message I could find that alluded
to this was a mention by Conquest of a warrior being blasted into the "ice
lava" beneath the bridge, and the Warder following him down. Were the
clerics sitting in a form of lava?

    And I agree with you there. I, like you, wish they'd said "DON'T DO
THIS, DUH!" It's obvious the top players will do whatever it takes to
succeed unless it's specifically communicated to them to not do it. I don't
begrudge them their desire to achieve, but the resulting nerfs rain down on
MY head, too.
