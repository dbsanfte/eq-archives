Haven't noticed any improvement in drop rates; they're still extremely
rare.  Spent an entire day slaughtering steam and earth elementals
wholesale, got 1 Mercury.  No Charcoal, no Swirling Mist.  Makes ya
wanna cry.

I gave up on making Banded a long time ago, as I was focussing on
trying to drive my skill up.  I started telling people who wanted
Banded that all they had to do was go get the raw materials, bring it
to me, and I'd make the armour for free.  I *never* have had to make a
piece of Banded since; folks would rather do without than run to
Kaladim and get the raw materials.

As for being able to "legitimately charge a lot more", most folks
don't want to pay anything now as it is.  I've had people complain
because I won't sell Fine Plate to them for 5 Plat per AC.  They'd
have an anyeurism if I charged by the effort required to make Cultural
armour.

(I've had people call me names because I wouldn't trade my Fine Plate
for their Bronze.)
