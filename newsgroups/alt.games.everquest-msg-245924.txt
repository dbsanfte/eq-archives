    I'm with you Danny.  I had no interest in CoH till I read Richard's
narrative.  Now I am seriously thinking about giving it a try.  I can't
really see myself giving up EQ, of course, but having another on-line game
to play, especially one that can be played in one or two hour blocks to
good effect might be good as a little "vacation".

   One thing Richard.  You said that you weren't going to be posting any
more of Umbriel's adventures here.  Personally, I wish you would.  Yes, CoH
is a different game than EQ, but it is a MMORPG, and I think it would be
nice to read about a comparison and contrast of how it handles things
relative to EQ.  Having a bit of perspective on how a competitor handles
things is hardly wildly off topic.

   Please reconsider.
