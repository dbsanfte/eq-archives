I have gotten my necro up to level 24 pretty easily.  Now I am camped next
to ill omen figting blue to yellow tigers, goblins sarnaks and such.  Thing
is, I keep dying and losing a LOT of exp, which is frustrating as hell.  I
decided to take a break from my necro and got a monk up to level 12 and a
druid up to 10, but I want to play the necro more.  I don't know why suddely
I'm having all these problems, but I keep getting fear or darkness resisted,
and they either come right for me and I have to feign or die, or the stay on
my pet, he dies, then the same thing as before happens to me.  What am I
doing wrong? Do I need to group at this level?
