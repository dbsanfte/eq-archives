Ok lets day you are going to fight in OT by the FM side and that you are
evil , the mobs you are expecting to see bezerkers, knights, tiger types,
rhinos, birds and spiked and thurned...The only caster they you will most
likly see if you lvl from 30 to 40 there are the goons....

Lets say you will fight at the lake near  the mill ... the chance to see a
casting mob are very , very small and you might say oh once ever 10h of
playing I get hit with a magic np.

You might fight the gaints in FM

Or in any other place where you are willing to take magic hits cause you
just don't care , like in DL fighting by the wall , sure the spiders cast,
sure they root the pullers but if you are not pulling you just don't care
cause they cast junk and the only real problem might be poison, which is in
no way affected by the - mag

Ok So here is the point, he asked the question  with some parameters , if
you think its stupid don't answer, if you know the answer/ have a addition
or a question and you want to share go ahead.

if you just want to be a richard ....save your self the bandwidth
