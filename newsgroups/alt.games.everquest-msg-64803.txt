Monday I went to a store with my old computer, and made a new one using some
of it's parts (modem, dvd, cd writer, hard drive) got a new hard drive, 512
DDRAM, an MSI K7 board with an AMD 1.9 XP, and a GeForce 3 card.. so
yesterday I got home with it, got on, brought all my eq files from my old
hard drive to my new one, reinstalled eq, kunark and velious, (to make sure
the paths were re-established on my c drive instead of my d drive), and then
dragged all of the eq file back into the directory (so I wouldn't have to
patch again).. go online (first time with new puter) and tried to patch..
wouldn't connect, cause it was crowded.. I didn't know that, I thought
something was wrong with my modem.. so I deleted my modem and restarted my
computer, it reloaded itself, I got back online and tried.. (complete
coincidense) it then connected.. I was like ah, it was the modem (found out
later it was just too many people hitting the patch server).  so it gets
about three fourths of the way done and... crash.. KERNEL32.DLL.. I'm like..
thats a windows file, nothing to do with eq, unless the patch was messing
with it, and it shouldn't have been.. so I'm like grr.. whatever.. try
agian.. same thing again.. this wouldn't be that bad if it didn't take about
40 minutes to get to the point where it crashes.  so I try it again. it
works, (now this is only the pre-patch, the bar, not the big patch screen)..
so then the patch screen comes up, yippee, fun, it's patching.. 4 hours.
hmm.. ok, if thats what it takes.. lets just say at 2 hours it gave me a
message, Local File IO error.. (like it couldn't figure that out when it
TRIED to write to the file in the first place??).. grr.. retry.. nope,
messed up again.. made sure all of the files were NOT read-only.. uh huh,
everythings fine, poop, was hoping that would fix it.. someone here said to
delete everquest.exe and let it start from scratch.. that is what I was
gonna do next, so with a second opinion to support me, I do it.. now it's
patching with about 20 minutes left.. (I'm expecting more errors, but it's
moving along.... slowly.)

thanks for listening, i'm hoping my new computer will rock eq (or at least
not be rocked)
