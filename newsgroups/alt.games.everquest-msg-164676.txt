I play a human druid.  I don't know about other classes, but I love my
druid.  The problem with low wis on humans hurt when I was low lvl, but as I
leveled and got money to get her some nice gear, I really don't notice the
difference.  When I look at what I "could" have had in wis if I played a
wood elf sometimes it is hard to take, but I don't think I miss out on too
many things=)

Take a look at my magelo and you tell me if being a human hurt me=)  I'm
quite happy.  But then again.. I couldn't tell ya about the other classes.
