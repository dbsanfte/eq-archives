I think you are being a bit overly dramatic here.

I have spent hours waiting for boats that never showed up (bugged or
broken) in the past. The system was broken and a CS nightmare. Nothing
beats having a GM tell you to get (ie buy)  a port from a Wizard or
Druid after waiting for 45mins in Erudin for a broken boat that will
never come.

>Remember back when people would make the 
>dreaded run from Qeynos to Freeport at level 1 to be with their friends?  

Been there...done that....about 50 times. There is no "adventure" in
running through a mostly empty zone like West Karana for 25 minutes or
getting "insta-dead" the first time you pop into Kithicor at night. It
simply teaches players to run along zone walls, and to sit and use the
/tim key before zoning..

>Remember back when the docks were full and it was a thrill if some 
>condescending wizard or druid will give you a free teleport?

No, I remember the Druid/Wizard rings being full, and players leveling
up port mules to whore for plat.

>Norrath is losing its fill of vastness with all this easy travel. 

Norrath still has a "feel" of vastness. The ability to port between
the major cities opens up many more zones for newbies to explore and
hunt in. Yes, travel is trivial now, but you gain the ability to hunt
in many more places. Especially if you are a casual player with only a
couple of hours to play. 

>Remember back when you were a low-level individual and you had to work your way from

1. Leave Freeport....
2. Follow zone wall through East Commonlands...
3. Follow zone wall through West Commonlands...
4. Wait at Kithicor zone line until 8am (tedious like waiting for a
boat)
5. Follow zone wall to Rivervale or High Pass..

The first couple of times can be new and exciting. After that it is
simply tedious.

Norrath is bigger now than it was then. Players have many more hunting
options now. Travel pre-Luclin/PoP was tedious and time-wasting. It
added a timesink to the game, not a challenge.

Then don't use them. It is as simple as that.

They hardly ever worked right. Hardly anyone would miss them.

It promoted a feeling of "you are sitting in front of a PC staring at
a monitor". 

>-- one saddened EQ lover.

No one is forcing you to use the books. Go ahead...ride the boats and
walk/run everywhere if that is what makes EQ fun for you. No one is
stopping you.
