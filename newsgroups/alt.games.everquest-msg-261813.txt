I still crave a cig on occasion - and it's been nearly 14 years since I
quit...  for me they were part of an "environment" and were props as much as
nicotine fixes...  so, when I visit cold climes in the winter, I want one
with the first morning coffee...  and when I go to a bar - I occasionally
want one...  occasionally with stress hits a pinnacle...  OTH - if I get hit
in the face with a load of smoke (even during a craving) I gag...  it's
about the desire - not the reality for me.

The trick is NOT having one.  I don't think the craving ever goes away...
