Are there any money-making quests around the Freeport area?  When I 
started my wood elf bard, I didn't play her for long because she couldn't 
win a fight with a bat to save her life.  When I rerolled her, the first 
thing I did was run to Kaladim, pick up the bard note, and bring it back 
- 4 gold, lots of exp, and I could buy 2 spells right then and there.  
The first spell gave me a bit of an edge in fighting until I could level 
up and start showing those bats who was boss :)

MUCH caution.  I'm at level 6 now.  I better learn to STOP singing that 
when I run into town very, VERY soon...

> Level 3 = Jaxon's Jig of Vigor (Rest0res Stam)

Okay, I have to ask - is this one of ANY use in early levels?  I don't 
think I've run out of stamina once so far.  Even my 19 shaman doesn't use 
much.

> Level 4 = L's Locating Lyric (Locate's targets corpse)
> Level 5 = Selo's Acclerando (Makes you run faster)

Buy a percussion instrument (ie, hand drum) when you get this song and 
start practicing, as it apparently increases your speed even more 
(haven't gotten good enough to tell the diff yet :) ).  I was very 
confused until a high-level bard friend explained to me that I couldn't 
equip it until I wasn't holding anything in either slot.  Mean game. :)

> Level 6 = Hymn of Restoration (Healing)

This apparently also improves when you use a string instrument.  
Unfortunately, you're not allowed to use one until level 8.
