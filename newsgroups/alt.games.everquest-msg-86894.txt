Not true. You're assuming a genuine offer. 

There was a case widely touted on the ranger boards a while back
of a rogue named Backs (Baxs?)  Stabber. He was aucioning a
shattered emerald for MQ. He found gulls, let them hand in their
epic quest parts so far setting them back hugely in their quests,
took the money and trades first if he could, but let them destroy
if they wouldnt anyway.

He never completed it, ever, and a half payment still didnt put
him at any "risk"; it just reduced the potential reward from his scam,
which is meaningless as he did it over and over and over and took a
remarkably long time to get banned, presumably ebaying or muling the
rewards all the while.
