Rooting a mezed mob is different, as is rooting a mob you are soloing,
In one instance (Hopefully) no one is beating on it, and in the other
one one person is, and only occasionally.  We are talking overagroing
through spellcasting.  I've yet to have a root stick for more than a
second in PoN in a group where people are beating on a mob.
