I wasn't so much thinking about the Bazaar prices, as the prospect of 
professional paid farmers camping all the spots with worthwhile 
droppable loot, and not giving a fuck about the PNP because they play 
disposable powerlevelled characters. That's what I'm talking about when 
I say "ruining the game". I haven't seen any instances of that yet, but 
if real world money enters the scene in a big way, I simply can't 
conceive it not happening, unless Sony really stomps the worm while it's 
still small.
