Presumably, since in an earlier patch message they said
that they had not yet been able to "fix" corpse timers
not counting down while offline.

Sigh.

I think this is a big mistake on their part.  This change
really screws over people who manage to die soon before 
they *have* to log for the night (or those who die
during non-primetime when a Cleric is hard to find), and 
I can't see any good reason for them to "fix" the way 
it has been working all this time.
