Is your website more cooperative yet? I want screenshots!

Oh, and what's the purple chain and red plate?

(I'm currently wearing plain leather, deep green leather, dark brown

It's a huge contrast from level 53, when everything I wore was plain
leather (darker gloves and boots and invis sleeves) :) )
