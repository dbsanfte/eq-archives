You could (faction allowing) go to Highkeep and work the warrior and
raider rooms for a bit. Lots of group opportunities. The Overthere is
very good for p/u groups and fast xp groups, though the loot sucks. Next
door is the Giant Fort in FM. Also very good. Paw would be nice as well,
but you may have to bring your own group there. It's a bit on the early
side, but you could take the ship to Iceclad in Vellious and try to get
into snow cougar groups there.
