Not really -- white will always win more games than black,
given equal opponents.   Even a player who would prefer
to play defensively can transition into a defensive postion
faster with white and without pressure by black.

Whether that advantage shows up in the real world with
the *rare* "equal opponents" is something else.   Real
world results rarely reflect ideal situations.   Chess isn't
"balanced" in game design -- white has an advantage in
tempo.    In the real world that often means he gets to
make the first mistake ... :D
