Because my focus was not on spiritual leaders. :) Thats why I ignored
Delenn.  There is a history of believable women in
medical/emotional/spiritual leadership positions, not so for military and
political leaders.

But since you *did* bring her up...

I agree with everything you say..thank you for articulating it better than
I have.  I want to like the character, but I've always had to fight to
believe that Sheridan could fall in love with her and that she was worthy
of so much respect by some people.

I'd love to be a woman like her. :) Fortunately I've learned that there's
more than one kind of strong person, so I'm saved from trying too hard.
