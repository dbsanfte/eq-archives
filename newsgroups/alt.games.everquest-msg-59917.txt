Sense spells were fixed some months back, they no longer
target pets of any kind.  They are still fairly useless, mind you,
but at least there is the -chance- they will give you information
you are interested in.

I think the one time my cleric ever actively (as opposed to
for Divination practice while waiting for the boat) cast sense
undead was to do the Bracer of the Revenant quest, clear out
the rifraff at the ghoul and skellie tower area, and it points you
straight at the quest mob... further away than  any track but
ranger.
