Heh.. Ok, I will admit to having such a hotkey on my cleric. And
I will admit to having used it a few times. Like a lot of
clerics, I'm using all my equipment slots on mana boosters and
mana regeneration items so dont have the greatest HP or AC....

For the most part, I rarely get agro or get hit. I have carefully
watched which heals get me attacked and killed when so I know how
to time heals of various degrees to keep from getting agro. I'm
really good at landing a CH on the MT just as the mob falls over
dead.

The problem occurs when the mobs refuse to obey the timing rules
;) That is where you have to be flexable.

The answer though to the original question is still, dont TRY to
gain agro as a BL, just add dps to the MA target as your default
action.



> we have 2 pallies, 2 beastlords, a druid and a necro ... I see
lots of off-tanking?

Definatly not. Necros CAN mez mobs using screaming terror. The
problem is most players dont know that and most necros wont
volunteer to do it. Personally, when I play my necro thats mostly
what I do, mezing and healing. (YES, Healing!) I'll match my
Necro against any wimpy chanter in the mez department.
