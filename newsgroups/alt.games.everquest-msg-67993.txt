 I have a VooDoo5 in my wife's PC and when EQ went to DX7 D3D became
much faster than Glide. The difference was most notable in tree-filled
Kunark zones. I will grant you that overall most Glide/D3D games work
better in Glide, but EQ was a different beast after the DX7
requirement.

I don't think that the new features in SoL could be done in Glide. It
appears that SoL relies heavily on T&L. Most of the cards currently
having problems do not have Hardware T&L embedded in them.
