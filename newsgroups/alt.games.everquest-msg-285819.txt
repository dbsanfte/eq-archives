	The domain's expired...  I always got a big kick out of these
and so I wanted to help out and renew the domain for the guy, but you
can't do that anymore (you used to be able to renew a domain even if
you weren't the owner).  

	So does anyone know where I can contact the wtf comics guy?  I'd
be happy to renew his domain for him if it meant he'd draw more comics...
