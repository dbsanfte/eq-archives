With the newui when it first came out people suggest copying all of the
files from default UI to your <insert name here for UISKINS file>.  Since
the last patch it has been suggested that you just put the new skin on it's
own into the customised folder.
IE ... I use the vert skin and have just copied that into my folder called
vert under the UI folder (not the default UI files).  If there is a problem
loading my skin it defaults to the Verant version in the default folder.
I think that makes sense o)
