If they're gonna do all that why not just sell the shit for RL $$
and be done with it?  Is it so freaking hard to enter the game to
take action in the game?  And if they did that sort of stupid shit
you do know what would follow, don't you?  Spam to end all spam
from pharmers and wannabe pharmers:  "Attention FayMart Shoppers".
Bah! and Humbug! don't begin to describe how disgusting I find
that suggestion.  The negative effects of the Bazaar are bad enough,
it's still a net plus for the game, shit like you're suggesting
would fix that in a huge hurry.
