No caster is hard. Even those with shitload of spells (chanters) are easy
to manage, as you slowly grow into them. If you buy one or PL it madly,
don't wonde r if you can't play the class, though :)

Most useful casters at higher levels are Cleric, Chanter and Shaman. That is,
if you look for getting into groups. Druids, Wizards, Necros, Mages etc
all have a hard time finding groups, whatever the few exceptional followups
to this will state :)

SK's and Pallies aren't casters, they're hybrids. Of those, only the SK can solo
more or less through fear kiting, but they're not THAT good at it, either.

Most caster classes offer medium. However, as a caster you are not in the
same problems as the large Ogre Warrior not finding a cheap BP for his
size or whatever. Casters are a lot less item dependent, we initially
more or less only care about getting our Wis and Int up.

This is a religious question. Soloing and passin areas are two things. 
Clerics get no invis, which is a big issue for travel at some spots, but they
are plate, so they can take a few hits. Druids and Wizards can port, and
like all other casters, can invis. Shamen are about the most versatile of all
the classes. SK's get FD and Invis, so travelling for them is ratehr easy and
safe.

If its about soloing, Necros arguably solo best, especially if their opponent
is undead. Shamen can also solo quite well, Clerics are pretty bad at it. Mages
have no means to mez or root a mob (asfaik), soloing Chanters is more of a
tricky possibility than anything else. Druids also solo very well and supposedly,
Wizards can, too.

Can't say much about these, they're not very important in most cases anyway :)
