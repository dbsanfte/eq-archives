It WAS bugged such that their hack job fix for the broken class
XP penalties gave the classes that had suffered it bonus Alt XP

Essentially, it used to go like this:

Mob A = 100 xp
Class A level 1 = 100xp
Class B level 1 = 200xp

So , Class B would have to kill two Mob A's to ding.

They "fixed" this by doing the following:

Mob A = 100 xp for Class A
Mob A = 200 xp for Class B

such that nobody who had suffered the penalty would suddenly ding
because they'd earnt level 80's worth of XP for a non penalty stricken
class.

Alt XP however, said 

Class A level 1 AA = 100xp
Class B level 1 AA = 100xp

but the XP from the critters was still being doubled for "Class B".

I wonder if VI learnt from this about the dangers of lashup fixes?
