Okay I am in a guild that is one kill (Cornaiv) away from Time access.
There is currently one guild on our server in Time and they have been
farming the holy hell out of it for oh about 6 months.  There is another
guild that is also only the Rathe away from Time hence my question.  We have
been told by our uber guild that there is no need for concern Time is
instanced and there is plenty for everyone.  In guild chat I have been
hearing that anything more then three guilds in that zone screws up the
instancing (there are currently 7 elemental guilds on my server).  Anyone
able to shed some light for me on the instancing in Time and if there is a
limit as to how many guilds before it goes boom.
