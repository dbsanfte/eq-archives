1) Yes, they can have you cast spells.  I've teamed with casters while
hunting them, the caster got Charmed, and I started taking damage.

2) No, it is not specifically Slot 8.  I used to keep Yaulp there, for the
same supposed reason.  It doesn't work.  At one point our Druid was healing
the EE almost as fast as I was damaging it (I won the race).  Her heal spell
was in Slot 3, I believe I recall her saying.  That ticked her off; she had
Gate in Slot 8, so that she'd bounce out of the Zone if she got Charmed.
But, it doesn't work like that.
