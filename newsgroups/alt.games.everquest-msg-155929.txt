I think in real life in the gaseous department I would be a level 60 Rogue.
I have mastered the arts on Intra-Vehicle Assasination, Intra Vehicle Apply
Poison, Instill Doubt and Set Trap. Of course they all make heavy use of the
discipline Control Decibel, but that is childs play to a true master...

***Intra-Vehicle Assasination.***

In it's simplest form just required exisite timing after a controlled silent
but deadly release. After the target has been judged just to be within AoE
range but as yet unaware, pose the simple question with a worried look on
your face: "Can you smell petrol?" (Altered as per fuel of vehicle, ie:
Diesel, Gas etc).

Suspect inhales hence resist is bypassed completely and they take full
damage in 3 nauseous waves.

***Intra Vehicle Apply Poison***

Most basic of all attacks. Does not even need use of Control Decibel, just
release and wind own window up. The normal reaction for other passengers is
to immediately wind their windows down which immediately draws AoE rain
damage down on top of them. Can be resisted easily through use of Hold
Breath ability but that can be countered with Extend Affliction focus items,
my favourite being refried beans. Smokers who have little Hold Breath skill
are a prime candidate for this attack.

***Instill Doubt***

Very advanced technique as it has a heavy reliance on surrounding built
enviroment. I have found the hollowed extruded aluminium bench seats at my
local shopping centre bus stop to be perfect though as they have a
magnificent 'tuning fork' effect.

Simply wait until the bench seat you are sitting on becomes full and using
Control Decibel let rip a "Rumbler". The effect is then not only deafening
as it is amplified by the hollowed extruded aluminium bench seat but is
actually <felt> along the entire length of the seat as well. AoE Fear effect
immediate upon failure of SvDisgust roll.

***Set Trap***

Again highly reliant on surrounds to determine best tactic. I have found the
bus to my work at Uni to be the best vehicular based ambush spot as everyone
get's off the bust at the same stop and it is a completley packed bus.

I simply arrange so I am sitting close to middle exit of the bus and hop up
early when approaching destination. Once bus slows to a stop, using Control
Decibel discipline aim for the loudest possible release without risk of
accidental Draw Mud proc.

Perfect entrapment. Everyone can see the shimmering, billowing cloud of AoE
rain effect but it is at the only exit for those at the rear of the bus
(which is why you don't choose the front exit - everyone on board can flee
to the middle exit) and they need to get off.  Resist saves are Disgust and
Belief and damage can be mitigated by Hold Breath skill but the sheerscope
of the attack and mobs affected make it effective nethertheless. Again,
Extend Affliction focus items maximise effects.
