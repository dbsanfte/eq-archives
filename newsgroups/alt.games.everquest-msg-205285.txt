Reverse experience with the free plat thing...I had a half-elf warrior I 
started (just to play around with...wasn't gonna do anything with him), 
and from the start he was recieving things....One FEMALE char gave him 
some armor "cause I was helped when I was young"...GOOD armor, too.  
Several male chars freely tossed a little plat and some items his way, 
then, one night, I was killing rats by Freeport, West Gate, and a female 
'chanter came up and gave him almost 500pp.  I was stunned.  When I asked 
why, she said "because I can afford it and I don't want to run all the 
way to the bank."  I told her thanks, then she added "besides, you're 
cute"  talk about being left speechless!  And, while I was still trying 
to figure out what happened, an female wizard came up to me, cast 
levitate on me, and proceeded to have me run around with her, jumping off 
the gates and stuff "because it's fun".  Were the females REALLY female?  
Hell, I don't know.  I just know they gave me stuff, with no mention of a 
return, and left me with a smile.

Since that day, I have have been rather free with giving items, casting 
what spells I can, etc for people..usually newbies...to kinda make-up-
for-the-kindness-done-to-me.  Just my story.

Miznit, 24 Wizard, E'ci
