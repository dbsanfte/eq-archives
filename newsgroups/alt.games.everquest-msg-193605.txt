    Tea Annie is also one of my EZ board handles.
 
    I can't say that I'm pleased that someone is using a name
that I am known by.  OTOH, I don't really play on EMarr, and it's
not like I have either copyrights out for the names "Annie" or
"Tea", or any combination of the two.  I can only hope that the
EMarr Teaanie isn't some kind of colossal jerk or deranged
stalker or something.  However, I can't say I have very high
hopes in this regard, if my namesake was forming a guild in OOC
in the PoK.  I guess that decent guilds can get started this way,
in theory, but I wouldn't be inclined to join one.

   OT here... Friday was my last day of work before I quit due to
the Big Move.  I felt odd as I cleaned out my desk.  And it was
even more odd when I realized how much tea I had on hand.  Maybe
I'm the deranged one.

Annie
