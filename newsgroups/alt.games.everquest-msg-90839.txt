You do have some good points.  Now, I am a newbie at DAoC, but will help
where I can:

DAoC Pluses:

* No Zoning
* Smooth Gfx
* Faster Load Times
* No "Corpse Retrievals"
* Quests for EVERY level
* AWESOME Graphics

DAoC Minuses:

* Boring same as same terrain
* Confusing Interface (to an EQ veteran)
* More expensive
* Can't run away from a fight if using "attack abilities"

Try it.  You'll problably like it.
