Well that is one way but druids now are mostly shuttle for group members to
get to raid spots and considered only minor support in raids. Why use a
druid at all any more when ports are not needed when a Wizard and Cleric
would do the job so much better?

I believe that has been the biggest argument about druids. They get into
raids now mostly because of their ability to get players to and from the
raid spots the fastest. Imagine if that was not the case anymore and anyone
could do it for free.
