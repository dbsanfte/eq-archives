 As you can see by all the different responses, there's really no right
answer.  One group I had while growing up in EQ was:

Monk, Shaman, Druid, Enchanter and we did quite well.


 Up until 40 you don't really need a Cleric because if you die you don't
lose much xp. The good part about any group of four as that it's not
that hard to find two other people LFGing that can fill those spots.
