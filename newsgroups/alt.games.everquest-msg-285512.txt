As usual, when I see the way the game handles updates I come here to gripe.

There's no need to tell me that doing this doesn't help, I know... or 
rather I know doing this won't change anything.  But it helps me to vent 
about it.

There's no use telling me that its always been this way.  A) No, in 
fact, it hasn't.  And B) it wouldn't matter if it had.

Go to the site
http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/network_status.vm
and as of 9:50am EST it shows all servers as UP.

But it also says all servers "will be" going down at 4am PST, which is 7 
am EST.  So what's wrong with this?

"All EverQuest servers will be coming down at 4:00 AM PST (-8 UTC) on 
Tuesday 12/05/2006 for a game update. Estimated downtime is 8 hours."

Well A) "will be" is wrong.  Either they DID go down at that point, or 
the did NOT, and since its well after that point, leaving this poor 
tense up is just sloppy.  I know, when written "will be" was right, but 
exactly how many seconds of effort would it take for some web flunky to 
go in at close to the appointed time and change the text so its correct?

B) start at 4am, continue for 8 hours, there is No Way those servers are 
actually "UP".

Sure, they may actually be up and running, for SOE to go in and test, 
but in what way is that the least bit interesting to the people using 
the site?

They are NOT up, for us, and there's a perfectly good tool sitting there 
that could be used to communicate their status to us, but SOE does not 
use it for that purpose.

Now lets go try and log in and see what message we get.

Hey, pleasant surprise, I logged in all the way to server select, where 
I see all servers as locked.  This is MUCH better than the previous 
setup, where I'd get the same message whether they were still patching, 
or whether there was merely congestion from people logging in.

Back to the web site though, I just refreshed, and it still shows all 
servers as UP.

Unconscionable.  Earlier, I assumed that the web site was looking at the 
same thing the server select screen looks at, and since we couldn't get 
to server select, the UP messages were just wrong.  But no, now server 
select tells the truth, Locked, while the web site lies with UP.

Its a small thing, I know.  I'm not threatening to quit EQ over it.

But it continues to piss me off just as much every time there's a patch 
and I have to look at how incompetently its being handled, Again.
