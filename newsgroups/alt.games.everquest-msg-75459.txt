What a waste.  Those domesticated dogs usualy drop HQ pelts.  After that,
it's probably LQ or ruined.  I could have used it for my tailoring....

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
