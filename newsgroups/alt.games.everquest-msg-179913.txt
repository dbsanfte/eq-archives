Hi all,

	I am relatively new to the game as a lvl9 Magician.  However, I
can't seem to get sense heading to work.  I have only put a couple of
skill points into it (needed them for more important things at the
time), but now that my character is getting around more knowing which
way I am heading is getting to be much more important.

	Any advice on getting it working or improving this skill would be
greatly appreciated.

	Thanks.

Regards,

Wayne...
