The snare has to come from one of the melees obviously, or they will
use root. With two healers at least, root is not the concern it might
have been.


>Shaman does not get evac.

Unless druid or wizard is in, the group is going to be sans evac
regardless. Evac is not so important you have to give a spot for it no
matter what. He can pick up other people for the spots that require
it.

Damage shields are not very necessary. Especially when the mob is
being slowed anyways.

He distinctly said he doesn't care about ports.

The druid skin line does not stack with the cleric's version, and he
already has a cleric.

Unnecesary with sow and not useable in half the hunting grounds
anyways. 

All these things are great but you're still taking significantly
longer to kill mobs and have very reduced aggro control by having
three support classes to one melee. In the long run it may be
extremely easy and safe exp but its gonna be SLOW. Especially with
three casters and no enchanter.

If he's going to get a druid along with the shaman, dump the cleric.
But don't go druid shaman cleric in a four person group.

Except just not as efficient as most other combos. Four people is
going to be able to succeed even if its four warriors together. He
asked which is best.

As a general rule, when choosing a support class, go shaman if you
want melee heavy and druid if you want caster heavy. That way you
maximize their usefulness. He wanted both shaman and cleric, and that
means his best bet is to go melee heavy.
