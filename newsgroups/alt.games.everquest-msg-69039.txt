Someone told me to remove robe and put it back on.  This seemed to fix
the elbow to shoulder problem I was having.  Still having a problem
when I cast.  Robe pops up and looks like it is in sitting postion
even though I'm standing.  When the spell completes the robe drops
back to normal standing position.  Basically I'm now a flasher. I sure
hope that doesn't become a bannable offense!
