huh? a 36 man raid is frequently optimum with 9 clerics ! one for each group
and 4 for the main tank cheal group. That one class represents 25% of the
people there, while only representing 1/15 or 6.7% of the actual classes.
You are overrepresented already ridiculously. In groups you fall to 1/6th
instead of 1/4th. Cry me a river :p

I dont really mind if clerics are the game played on easy. The rest of us
just dont want to have to depend on them.

Not really true in the first place. REALLY not true when you consider
defensive. Any truth it does have is a an artifact of a broken armor class
rating. My monk has a 1250 AC , the best monks I actually know hover around
1400. Warriors easily go up to 1800  . If AC was linear as it should be then
warriors would tank so much better they would make monks look like rogues.
The rumours I have heard indicate any armor class over 1100 really has no
effect whatsoever.
