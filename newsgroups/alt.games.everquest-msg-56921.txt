And I didn't even know what munge means, and I have no filters turned on at
all, and yet I get a max of 15-20 junk emails a week, and NONE of that can I
attribute to posting my real email address here.

But assuming that I get ALL my spam because of posting here, 15-20 junk
mails a week is NOTHING.
