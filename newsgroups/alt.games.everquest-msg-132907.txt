Yea, it's a toughie.  But in my expeience, there's more time than one 
would think that you're standing around picking your nose, waiting for a 
boat, waiting for a port, trying to sell junk in ec, waitng for 
your friend to get a boat or a port, whatever.  If you just make a hotkey 
with appropriate pauses to fire it off 4-5 times, and hit it occasionally 
during this dead time, it goes up.  Slowly, but it gets there.
