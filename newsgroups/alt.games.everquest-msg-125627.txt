http://eq.castersrealm.com/ is one of my favorites. Hits the biggest
stories mainly...

http://www.everlore.com/ is okay, but way too much "fluff", IMO. Seems
they'll post any submitted news stories.

http://eqvault.ign.com/ used to be a lot better, but they've been
lagging behind a LOT lately, it seems. About a year ago, it was
probably the best source of EQ news...

Finally, http://everquest.allakhazam.com/. This site is mainly for
equipment and quest info, having an extensive database for both.
Probably the best source of this information. Their "Premium service"
opens new search options as well as a few other extras, but all the
information is available for free. They do cover the big news stories,
though. Basicly, if you need to know where to find an item or how to
do a quest, Allakhazam's is your place. Just don't trust their item
prices. As with any user-submitted prices for items, they get skewed
easily by some joker posting 100000000pp for a rusty dagger or some
junk like that.
