Out of curiousity Lance...since you play both a shaman with competency and
mage with competency (or so it sounds from your post), is the effort to
pet canni, and the time it takes away from your nuking, significantly
greater than the effort of your shaman to do regular canni?  And if it is
more work, is it proportional to how much greater the man regen over
shaman regen is?

As you can imagine, my husband is pleased to get back the hat of "the
fastest mana regen in the game" with this change (especially since shaman
spell cost is balanced around their mana regen...I don't believe mage
spell cost was ever balanced against pet canni).  So I'm curious about it
from the POV of someone who has played both (and not as bots).
