For Pandas/Granitebacks... stick to the area just southwest of the Cat
Village... there's a little flat area where the visibility isn't too bad

Other than that, just keep your speakers turned up so you can hear any
possible adds before they get too close (thank god those pandas don't have
Kunark agro radius!) ;o)
