Love PoJ exit, I did 3 levels there=) very happy memories of 
grouping there. I share your hatred for Karnors=) the trains are 
horrible, only had 3 really fun groupings there with guildies - 
the pickup groups sucked wadd.

This cleric gets levitation potions in bazaar, or mooches lev 
rings from her high level mage friend, uses her gnomish vanishing 
device or cloudy potions, and has run3 but prior to run 3 used 
shammy-ia-a-bottle [sow potions]

It isnt impossible, just annoying =) though I will confess that I 
still have all my sol ro quest armor, and a pack of sow,lev and 
invis potions in the bank for corpse runs=) as well as a couple 
chipped bone rods in case I dont recognize where I died.

<yup, 56 and I still solo =\>
