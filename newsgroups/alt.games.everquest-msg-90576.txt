<Stormhammer stuff snipped>

Hehe.  Reminds me of that Twilight Zone where the guy gets killed and
suddenly starts getting everything he wants.  He gets really bored of it and
says something like, "If this is heaven, I'd rather be in Hell."  And the
fat man tells him, "But this IS Hell" and starts laughing at him.

Seriously, I know the text is a joke, but if Stormhammer were anything close
to that, I'd pay the better money to get back to Povar.  As it is, I expect
I will never know first hand what the Legends severs are like, though.  I'll
probably stick with Povar until I retire the toons.
