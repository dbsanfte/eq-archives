On a new server when the bugs(tarants/scarabs), mummies, and madmen are
hunted to extinction for leveling and there is no-one of applicable
level available to kill the SGs.  when I was leveling in NRo on
Torv(month 1 of the server)  4 person team at derv 3, the way we broke
the camp, was to wait for the SG to come by and bounce the camp for us. 
There was also an SG which wandered right into our usual med spot so we
were forced to med on the wall.
