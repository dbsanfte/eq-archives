There is a tiny possibility you fell through the world logging in,
that could make your corpse warp to the zone safe spot after you eat
the 10k death while linkdead.

That is the most likely possibility I could think of.

You know, if you go linkdead while running, you keep running? Boy did
that save my butt a few times while quad kiting raptors.. but it was a
bit disconcerting finding myself hovering over water with no land in
sight in any direction when I log back in.... *cracks out the /loc
hotkey*

Now the man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight,
so he loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamite!
He waited and he waited for the cat to come around;
Ninety-seven pieces of the man is all they ever found....
