I prefer *slaughter x number of mobs* myself.  In a true pickup group you have
no idea how the other members are going to play.  If no one has a map or
tracking and you get assasination / rescue you can be pretty darn screwed.  No
*way* do you have the same odds of completing such a quest as you do on a
*slaughter x*.  I don't even think it's close.
If I'm playing with a bunch of friends who have good gear and maps I'm up for
anything.
