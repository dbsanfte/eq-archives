I remember reading somewhere, I know .. it doesn't narrow the search much
:), about some db mobs that were real good for getting AAs at 52 but turned
lb at 53 but now that my gnome mage is making his way through 52 I can't for
the life of me find the page again lol. Could well have been on Mage
Compendium but I've been looking for a while on there and other forums
without success.

Question I do have about AA exp though is ... do the mobs need to give
normal exp to give AA exp? ... if I ever find the camp I've mentioned is it
better to stay at 52 while getting AAs or will dinging to 53 and killing the
same mobs when they're lb make no difference to the rate they move the AA
bar?
