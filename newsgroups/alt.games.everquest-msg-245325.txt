Out of curiosity, how often do you think your 5k WMBS is actually
purchased by the person who's actually going to use it and how many
times is it bought by a speculator?

As for the "greedy plat seekers," you might want to keep in mind that
they are also generally trying to buy upgrades. Getting 8k for a WMBS
puts me a lot closer to saving the 75k I need for my ornate bracer.
