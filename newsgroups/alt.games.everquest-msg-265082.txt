These are things like the little gnoll camps throughout Antonica.  If
you clear out the mobs belonging to them, you have a chance of
triggering some kind of even or special spawn.  They are, AIUI, used
for certain of the armour quests, for instance.

This is all gathered from the beta forums, I haven't actually tried it
in game.

People have been complaining that there is not enough solo content.  I
don't think this is the kind of content they've been asking for
(quests and dungeons seem to be what most people complain about), but
it is a form of solo content.

Aren't these the ones in the villages, i.e. no in the city itself?  I
know there are now four different entrances in Castleview Hamlet,
where before there was only the one.  I assume these will get some
kind of differentiation eventually, perhaps with quest NPCs.
