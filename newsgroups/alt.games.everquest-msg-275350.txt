Gah! Speaking as a former cleric (well, and as a current one, although my 
little baby cleric isn't yet in a position to be valuable to anyone)....that 
just makes me shudder. I almost always made sure I was the last to leave an 
area if things went wrong. I've gone down casting heals on other players 
multiple times. Of course, that was in EQ...EQ2 might not have the same 
breed of noble clerics that EQ has.
