I'm suddenly reminded of a scene from Buffy where that geek andrew had to
stab a pig and sacrifice it.... "that'll do pig"

To be honest, I probably _could_ kill and skin an animal if I had to, but
I'd need a good reason.  And that's only because my father rehabilitated
hawks and owls, which meant I had to handle a LOT of dead rodents.  
Cutting a mouse in 3 pieces and forcefeeding a young hawk gets you used to
gooey messes.  (He also picked up fresh roadkill...whee!  Anyone else on
a.g.e ever been to a Roadkill Cafe?  I miss those out here.)

It's been a while, though, so I'd probably be a little shaken the first
couple of times I knocked off a critter.
