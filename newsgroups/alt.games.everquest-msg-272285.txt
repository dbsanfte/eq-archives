I suppose the designers would say that it was your own fault, because you
didn't complete the quests while you were on an appropriate level. That you
couldn't finish them alone until now was by design; they were designed to be
group quests.

Maybe, but the effect would be a reduced incitement to group, because the
soloers would just wait a little longer before taking on the quests. This,
in turn, would punish the groupers, because fewer people would accept
invitations, and it would generally be against the whole philosophy of the
game.

I tend to solo a lot myself. In fact, I doubt I would be grouping at all,
were it not because some quests force me to. This would be a pity, because
occasionally I do get into a really enjoyable group, where everybody are
loyally trying to make the group work for everybody, and when this happens,
life in Norrath is at its best.
