A petition remains in the queue for 3 hours as I recall.  If you get no
response within that time frame, you will have to petition again.  Yes, it
sucks big time, because that means you get to go to the back of the queue
again.  One time that I petitioned I never got a response, all other times I
have gotten a quick response with a satisfactory resolution to my problem.
