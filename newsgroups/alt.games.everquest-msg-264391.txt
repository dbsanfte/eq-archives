Gak. Not sure why I assumed monk there. And in fact that rather 
highlights the difficulty in settling this. The loss of dps from a monk, 
would likely be more significant than that of a warrior pulling... 
meanwhile in many camps pulling might simply require the sk/pali to spin 
180 degrees spear/stun to pick up a mob and a social add and then turn 
around again, resuming their dps on the mob (now at 21%...)

Clearly the situational logistics of pulling, including who and how, 
dramatically shift the comparative efficiency of large pulls vs small 
ones. 

The real shift to favouring large pulls occurs when all pulls, or small 
pulls are very time consuming. But this isn't always the case; it isn't 
even generally the case, ime at least.
