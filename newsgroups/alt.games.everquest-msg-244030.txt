Absolutely right. The weapon (and a lot of other items) have recommended
levels. This means that you can equip the item at a lower level, but with
lesser stats. These will increase as you raise in levels. Eventually, when
you hit the recommended level of the item, you will get the "full" stats
from the item - the stats written in red.
