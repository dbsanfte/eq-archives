Dark Ember if your cash is in the 1-2k range, drops at Rygorr fort
from Blacksmith I think and 41 is a good level there. Nice stats and a
decent proc. My 55 is still using this weapon just no real reason to
change it.

Cheaper is velium etched stone mace for the 200p range +3Wis and str
not bad to swing either. Drops 99% of the time from Named Tizmak in
GD, Razorhooves I think is its name. YOu can track him and kill easily
at 41.

Higher end stuff too numerous to mention check out eqdruids.com.

Suggest you also pick up a decent shield with manna, wis, and ac to
replace that book before 50. Count on spending 2-4k.
