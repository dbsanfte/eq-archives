Dense?  Less than mature?  Neither is trolling in and of itself.

His WTC thread was stupid.  He gave absolutely no thought when starting the
thread...at least, that's how I read it.  To be a troll he'd've had to have
started the thread TO start a war.  I think he (based on other posts) simply
screwed up.

When being non-dense and mature are required for Usenet it will surely die a
quick death.
