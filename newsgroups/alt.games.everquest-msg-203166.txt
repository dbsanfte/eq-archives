His charm is better than mine, with the extra flags for time.

I don't quite understand why that doesn't equate to more AA's tho.

I originally thought it was an AA for each zone now "unlocked" zone, but
when I did my AA's and charm again last night (go go Prexus crash - 17 or so
hours downtime, 24 hour+ rollback/character restoration from backup, and 2
subsequent crashes since!) I actually paid attention to this text this time.

Anyway, one of my stories was for Rallos Zek, and one for Solusek Ro.  Not
that im complaining of course, but getting an AA for every advance in PoP,
regardless of the zones new status, doesn't seem to be right...
