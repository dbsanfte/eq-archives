Au contraire. Buy your laptop with the least amount of memory you can get,
and get more memory from someone else than your laptop manufacturer. They
all have huge markups on memory, for both laptops and stationary computers.
Identical memory without a "Compaq" sticker is often half the price.

For laptop memory I recommend buying from crucial.com, where you can select
what laptop model you have and they know what kind of memory you need, and
will guarantee that it works with your model.

Damn, now you're making me jealous since my laptop has a crappy Mach64 based
card that, although it will *run* pre-luclin EQ, isn't even usable for trade
skills.
