Try Dulak Harbor instead.  I got a Carved Fox Ear while questing for the Charm
of the Emerald Warrior there.  The Fox Ear wasn't very useful to me, but the
Emerald Warrior one is great for wood/high elves and others who are willing to
max faction with the Emerald Warriors in Kelethin (3 AC, 8 Dex, 15 hp, 15 PR at
max faction).
