I was farming pelts and silk for tailoring in EK and noticed this kicking 
in.  Sure was nice for nuking that Hill Giant and still getting him re-
rooted without getting whomped on.

When I rooted the HG, let him hit me and then see Tarbul running straight 
at me ( I swear he wasn't there a second ago ), the only extended range I 
needed was to extend my ass out of Tarbul's range ASAP.  Thank god for the 
AC popping the other day.

I still see people bickering on other boards about whether Hasten will take 
plat instead of gold.  Just for the record, I used plat, not gold and it 
worked.  I'm sure most of you know that works in most, if not all, cases.  
I've done it on various quests and it's worked everytime.  It was fun 
keeping Hasten hailed and turning the stuff in solo.  For the first minute 
and a half he wouldn't respond to me and was pissing me off ( the bastard 
is -fast- with -his- boots ), and then I realized I was invisible.  Pure 
genious.
