I wonder why mudflation hasn't made alchemy profitable?

I mean, we're told that there's more and more money in the game, that 
this is driving prices up for items...

This -should- mean that while someone might not have paid 100pp in 1999 
plat for a DS potion, they'd be happy to spend 100pp in 2004 plat for 
the same potion, given that its only 10pp in 1999 pp.

There are tons of nice shaman potions out there, all we need is for the 
price to drop to what, a tenth what it is now?  Since components are 
bought off vendors, thats not going to happen, but if there's sufficient 
inflation, the value of a pp will drop to where the same thing occurs, 
more or less.
