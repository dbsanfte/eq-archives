As many of you probably know, Innoruuk server went down again yesterday.

My wife & I had just pulled a named Vamp in the Castle in Tenebrous at
the time. When it came back up my wife was still in TM and I was naked
at my bind point :(

I petitioned and a Guide came and gave me 100% GM rezz! I was very happy
with that, looted my stuff and then got jumped by various roaming
nasties. A quick stun & mezz and I gated out. As it was late (I'm in the
UK) I camped out and noticed (at 5 seconds... (typical!)) that the rezz
hadn't restored my lost EXP. I had 26% before I died. 16% after the
death and it was still showing 16% after the rezz.

The Guide who had rezzed me was no longer on so I petitioned again and
another guide told me there was nothing they could do as there was no
corpse. She escalated it to a GM but they hadn't got back to me by the
time I had to log and go to bed.

Has anyone else experienced a GM rezz failing or is this a one-off? It
is frustrating as I turned down a 75% rezz from a Pally in my guild in
order to get the 100% GM rezz! I guess some you win and some you lose!

I'm not whining about this as, in practical terms, it just means I have
extra playing to do and playing EQ is no great hardship :) I'm just
curious to know if this has happened to anyone else.

Xanthalas, 56 Beguiler (less 10% exp! hehe :)
