Oddly enough...

Ok, first off - an instrument in your secondary slot will always make
the song more effective.

That being said:  Tonight was the first time in over half a year that
I got a message saying that my instrument skill (in this case, brass)
had gone up when I didn't have the instrument equipped!

*that's* new to me.  Not complaining though - and I realize I wasn't
get full effect of the song, but I don't mind the skill raise!
