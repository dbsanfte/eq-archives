The epic pet is situational now -

Level 61 Ward of Xegony - Level 60, Max hit 83, 3800 HP, 45pt DS with
Flameshield of Ro

Epic Pet - Level 49, Max hit 83, 4300hp, innate 50pt DS

The moment you start hunting harder mobs in Tier one, or Tier 2+
mobs the epic needs to be put away.  The simple reason is that 
much of it's damage is from procs, and they won't land on level 60+
mobs.

Some mages like it for tanking lower level mobs, as it pulls aggro
better, has more hp and an innate DS.  It's also nice because you
can have a pet when your naked.

As an example of what the 61 air pet can do - Yesterday in Nadox
I had a fully equipped air pet (summoned armor/focus/weapons/belt/virtue)

We used it to tank the Spiritseeker of Nadox while a wizard, druid
and I burned and an eq/am3 ranger with a 38/40 bow used trueshot on
it - and the pet never lost aggro, and held up to the beating fairly
well.

The same with many rangers (40% item haste isn't easy to get for
folks in lower powered guilds).
