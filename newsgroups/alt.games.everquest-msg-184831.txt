Was running through Dreadlands today... game froze.  Still heard
sound, but video froze and mouse was non-responsive.

Hit CTRL-ALT-DEL, and the game kicked in and I started running for a
few seconds before it went into windowed mode, and the Ctrl Alt Del
box popped up.  I cancelled the box, and the game ran for another
second or two, then gave the "You Are Disconnected" message.

Ever since then (even after rebooting), the game keeps playing in
windowed mode. (Text slightly squished an all.)  Can't get it to go
back to fullscreen.

Any suggestions?
