BTW, in East Commonlands, the Shadow wolves spawn/roam in the northern
half of the zone between the entrance to Nektulos to the West
Commonlands zone line.  I once thought that no more than three could
ever be up at one time, but, to my surprise, I saw 5 of them there
last night.  No paws, but dropped several tibias.  You may have to
kill 20+ to get a paw, and it may be a long hunt.

Was checking zone to see if it is safe now.  Couldn't find any more
Dark Elf military, and the guards were back, as were several
lowby-looking players.  Appears safe.  

North Ro, on the other hand, has the Troll Army Comanded by level 70
DE's.  Standing there, near the docks, facing Freeport.
