I've spent the past week AE'ing droga (60 monk, 60cleric, 60wizard) to a)
get chardok faction  b) to plevel my little gnome wizard some

60 wizard is epicfied, was using gelid and (if 1 didnt kill them all) Jyll's
wave of heat .

If they were agro on the wizard, as soon as epic faded (hint: not long with
20-30+ mobs hitting you), I couldn't cast either spell, no matter how many
times I tried.  Easy to channel through?   The cleric was lucky to even get
DA off if the ae went wrong, even 6-8 tizmaks will interrupt 95% of heals on
a 60 cleric (60 for months, so skills are maxed)

I spent a long time testing all these
