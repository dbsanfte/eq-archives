Look at the shape that the zone makes.  Compare that shape to a nearby 
zone's name.  I thought it was a nice touch.

They are Enchanters.  They will usually cast these spells on you:

tash*
choke
a knockback stun
charm
sanity warp

The battle will get much harder if you let them get their pet summoned.

If you are an enchanter yourself, and get charmed by one of the eyes, your 
pet will no longer be your pet and will just stand there until the server 
gets rebooted.  I had several pets in the gorge at one time and finally got 
a GM to get rid of them.

Get a High MR and don't let them summon a pet.  Get someone to "break" the 
camp for you.  Then see how well you do against them.

Muddites and Minos roam by there, and the higher minos can put a hurtin' on 
ya ( Chasm minos, I think ) while you try to med.
