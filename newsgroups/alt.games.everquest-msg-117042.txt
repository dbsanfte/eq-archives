But they are still missing the point, that people actually use these
games to join together in order to have fun and socialize with family
and friends

Whether its EQ or AD&D .... or Monopoly, its always possible to find
and dig into the negative side - and apparently so much more fun that
to focus on the possitive aspects of a game.
