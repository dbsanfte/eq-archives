I've been on the receiving end of one of these heals below and was extremely
grateful!!
Please don't ever stop helping us if we're near dead... it's most
appreciated.

----------------------------

 I've had it happen to me in the past as well, a monster has me damn near
dead, I'm lying on the ground bleeding
to death with the monster still hitting me, and suddenly boom, I am healed.
In my mind, I'm lucky I lived, if the healer or anyone else wants the
monster, take it.
