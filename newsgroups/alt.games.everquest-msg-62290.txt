If the `kill list' is character based then the issue of guild responsibility
is somewhat reduced. You still give every member of the guild a chance to PK
until they are noticed.

Sure, but this is how pirate towns worked historically isn't it? The
reason to build is because even PK'ers need somewhere safe to bind,
gear up and sell their ill-gotten gains. And, since they're able to
create wealth without labor, it could be very lucrative to make a 
town to serve their needs.

It sounds cool. Effectively there will be `orderly' towns and some
less reputable ones. With the possibility of PK'ers agreeing to a
truce in a single town if the economic situation encourages such. At
which point the orderly towns would, hopefully, consider destroying
the town....hm, the degree to which a town can be reduced / destroyed
is going to be a fine balancing act.

It still seems like the countryside, and process of levelling, are 
going to be exceptionally dangerous.

And, to an extent, I don't really care if SB happens or not. I'm mostly
interested in how the designers planned to balance out the more predatory
parts of human nature :)
