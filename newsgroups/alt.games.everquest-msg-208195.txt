Not looking at it from a raid perspective but I'd think that this
hurts the monks a lot less than any other pulling class since monks
are a lot less dependent on spells when pulling than anyone lse. So,
they became better pullers in relation to everyone else because they
got nerfed less. It would seem to me that the pacify/harmony pullers
will be hurt by this the most, making that unuseable in a lot of
places. 

... and yes, I do see where my arguement doesn't apply to you
specifically. Pulling for raids is a whole different ballgame.
