The "bum cam" views (first and second F9 views) can't
have the camera angle changed, I don't believe, but the
third and fourth can.  They have full range of camera
motion:

Alt-left and Alt-right = rotate camera 360 degrees around you.

Alt-Home and Alt-End = Move camera in/out.

Alt-Up and Alt-Down = Move camera up and down (altitude).

Alt-PgUp and Alt-PgDn = Move camera up and down (angle of view).

Note that an obstacle in the way will restrict the camera
"position" (it must always have a clear line of sight from
the "camera" to your character), so to get the best feel
for it, experiment in a wide open area at first.

As far as being "locked in place", the camera position/angle
will remain the same for each view, even if you leave the
game and come back later, but the camera will not "swing"
around with you in the third and fourth views as you rotate
your character to look N/E/W/S, it will always be facing
whatever compass direction you last placed it to view.
