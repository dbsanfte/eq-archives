and it only has half the pixel shaders and it has tried to force it's
own version of DX9 (CG) on games developers and failed badly and so on
and so on ... this article which is actually written by a Nvidia
apologist (well I think he is) probably describes Nvidia's failures
with DX9 far better than I can.

Why Use the Pixel shaders which are not used by anyone else and require
special compiling when you can get the proper DX9 configuration out of
the box so to speak (translation is that if SOE went this way they
would have to spend extra money .. fat chance).

Agree with this but given their past and questionable history with GoD
and the upcoming expansion .... I think this is highly likely ... can
anyone smell a Brenlo in the wings?

Let's see do SOE buy a solution for a lot less money or do we buy a
solution which costs a lot more.  I think SOE will go for the out of
the box DX9 (fully compliant DX9 not an Nvidia hybrid) solution which
costs less and will alienate the Nvidia community.

Don't get me wrong if this next expansion is a full proper DX9
implementation then Nvidia cards old and new will run but so badly
compared to the ATI solutions there won't be a comparison.

It could be a hybrid solution like Halo but to what end why not just
stick with DX8?

PS sorry if I lost the majority of you in tech talk and hope those that
are sticking with this understand it.
