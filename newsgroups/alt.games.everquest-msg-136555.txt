Getting lost!  The last time I ran it, I got very, very lost, lol.  Well I
will try again.

If  memory serves, Hill Giants from 34 to 39.

At 39 I went to the Wakening Lands to buy a spell and got killed by Wuoshi.
The CR was a nighmare.  Don't go to WL until you are at least indiff to CoV.
(May be different for you - I heard onece that on serverds other than FV,
Wuoshi was perma killed.) So, after that I made a real effort to get my CoV
faction up.  Killed Frost giants in groups in Great Divide until I could
solo them.

Moved to Timorouse Deep and single killed Spirocs until 40 and then quadded
until 50 (should have left at 49 as soon as I got the new AoE) Been quadding
Wyvern and just made 53 yesterday.
