There are no games that are similar to EQ, though if you can be more
specific about what you want to do in a game there are some substitutes.

Give it a few weeks and I feel pretty confident that Verant will get the
bugs worked out.   Also make sure that you've updated your video & sound
drivers AFTER you upgrade to dx8.1.  If the problem is that you don't have
the latest drivers it's your fault, not Verant's.
