 Any mob 51+ can summon. Although there are a few who don't I think.
There are also a few below that can (think Fire Giants).

 Mobs can only summon once every 15 (Somewhere around there) seconds.
You would more than likely be summoned no matter where you were,
regardless of range. Being a monk I'm nearly always in melee range and I
still get summoned.

 Also, mobs that are not damaged wont summon. So more than likely
someone was fighting the ebon lotus thing and had either died or feigned
death and then you aggroed it and got a summon. At least I've never had
mobs summon me without doing some damage to them first.
