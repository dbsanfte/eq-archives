Probably want to be at least 15th level before hitting Paludal, at least for
the main bandit camps.  You may be able to get into a Phlarg group at
earlier levels, but it's not easy to get to them because you have to get
past the higher level recondites.  Also the Phlargs give you the crud and
unless you can remove disease you will be in trouble.

If you want to avoid Oasis from 12-15, try the sewers in Queynos.  Stick to
the left hand wall and fight the bandits and smugglers.  Very good exp and
almost always empty.
