Had this NG not had an influx of the "DAoC R0x, EQ Suxx0rs" posts then yours
might be treated differently and we might just all laugh at it knowing that
Verant would never consider doing such a thing.
Unfortunately, we get such trolling from the pro DAoC camp that this is
likely to be viewed in the same way, whether it was meant that way or not.

Yes, I knew this happened, I was actually chatting to my friend on the phone
when he found out yesterday afternoon (GMT) He lost exp from a roll back
(although he claims he lost no money, gained in that time, from it) then
logged back on to find he had gained much more exp than he lost. Did I even
think, way I wish Verant were so kind and generous? No, I've been on that
side and the grass only looks greener, it doesn't taste as good.

You have posted as a way of showing how a game company should treat their
players, so what now...we all boycott Verant and go play DAoC? We realise
what a tyrannical power SOE really is and join forces to plot their
downfall? What?
