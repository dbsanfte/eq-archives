Normally when I have free time to kill, I waste them on EQ but I had
to take a break after a freak accident killed my character in PoK.
Seems I ran into a rare but known bug where player can fall for 20000
damages (yes, twenty-thousands, the max possible damage in EQ
universe)  I've filed petition, reported myself (quoting where it says
I fell) and then bug report.  Not sure if Sony would do anything or if
I'd have to get someone to rez me.

I'm sure some of you had fell for 20K.  If you have, where were you
and did you get full XP refund or did you have to get someone to rez
you.
