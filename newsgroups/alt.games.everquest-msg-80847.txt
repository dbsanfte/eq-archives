 We weren't looking for maximum exp, we just wanted to move on to the
next wing. North didn't seem a bad wait (less than two hours maybe), but
we literally waited four hours once in the West wing waiting for that
damned named skelly to pop. In my opinion that is an unbearable wait if
you're trying to 'do' the dungeon as intended. And we couldn't just do
North again because there was two groups there already. Then again,
maybe Verants intention was to get more rogues into groups. Or not since
if you have a rogue you'll more than likely go straight to South Wing.

 So try it a few more times and see how it goes. Basing everything on
your one time there isn't a very accurate sampling in my opinion.
