My read would be that given the choice of comparing to necro or Druid,
or someplace between, he said that they will be less than druids, but
not as good as SKs,  implying that Druids would be less soloable than
Necros and Beastmasters would fall below that.  Although considering
that SKs are reasonably soloable they are better than warriors, or
Rogues.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
