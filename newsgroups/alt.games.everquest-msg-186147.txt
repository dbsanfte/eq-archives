They already fixed the mage problem.  Indifferent pets (when wielded by an
intelligent pet caster who knows how to *keep* them indifferent) make the
issue of pets taking the long way to get to a target a very small issue
indeed.

I'm betting the "dead spots" won't be fixed with this.  I don't know exactly
how they're implementing the change to pathing, but I'm guessing it will be
a switch from laid out paths (currently) to an overlay grid with
point-to-point travel.  I know of a couple tried-and-true dead spots to test
out after this goes live, so we'll see.  With a grid system, though, I can
see the distinct possibility of even more dead spots showing up.

I'm not sure that I'd call it a monk nerf, per se, but there's no doubt that
monks take the brunt of any downside of this.  There are entire areas of
mobs that are 1-group mobs that will probably move out of the range of a
single group with this change.  The biggest culprits are of course in
Velious, where Sony decided to make everything walk back instantaneously
after a feign.  In raiding I don't see it having a huge impact, but there
will be some particular pulls (NToV triplets come instantly to mind) that
may cross the line to impossible except by a force so well-equipped and/or
huge that any force that could handle it would have no interest in doing so.
