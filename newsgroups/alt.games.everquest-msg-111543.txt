Ignorance is forgiveable, at least your willing to admit that fact.

IIRC, there is an article on the Casterrealm site that talks about EQ2, and
they describe how a character will be created.

It's a brand new system, so it would be impossible to switch over from EQ1
to EQ2.

Please forgive my shortness with you, but you are about the 6th or 7th
person to talk about switching between the two games.
