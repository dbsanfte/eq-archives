Tunare, the home of my former main Kaev, is pretty busy as well.

I think TLC is a badly flawed attempt to implement a good idea.  Bolting
their TLC implementation onto a game/loot/quest system designed without
it makes for all sort of stupidities.  And given FV's designation as a
"roleplaying preferred" server the worst of its side-effects is that
many quests become next to impossible without resorting to a combination
of spoilers and "remporary" low level alts made to collect quest bits
off green mobs (tho I near now that /raid kills the TLC, wonder how long
until they fix that), which kinda kill the "immersion" that I see as a
big part of an RP environment.  Items should be individually TLC
flagged, with max level, just as they are individually flagged for so
many other attributes.

My L37 Human Druid has no language other than Human above 10, heh.
He's not a bigot, just a lazy SOB.
