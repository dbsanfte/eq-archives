Yeah but judges appointed by republicans rarely behave as they are supposed
to .They have the tendency to really irritate republicans after a few years
on the bench :) Many times republican appointed judges decide in ways that
are contrary to what 80% of republicans would have wanted. The problem with
appointing judges who try and interpert the law instead of writing it is
that you create a 2 edged sword.

Liberal appointed judges on the other hand frequently make outrageous
decisions. The recent case in new york is a point for that. The law was very
clear on what was supposed to happen. The law was completely ignored. Since
the democrats control the state anyway what they SHOULD have done is call a
special session and just appoint lawtenburg as senator since that is
completely within their right and the law to do. (or if you want to make it
a less bitter pill just rewrite the election laws).

Incidently I didnt really care if that senate seat was won or lost for this
particular election anyway. It is a democrat voting area of the country and
any republican there is an aberration .
