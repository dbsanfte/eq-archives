Hello, all.

I'm looking for a little advice.  I'm a 19 druid (first character),
and I have the opportunity to use 2 items.  One, the Prayer Cloth of
Tunare, has a +3 wis boost.  The other, a Frozen Mantle, has a +10
mana boost.  Which do you think would be more beneficial to me?  I
just want to check and see what the benefits are of wis vs. mana.  AC
on the FM is better as well, but I'm willing to sacrifice that for
better casting.

Of course, on Allakhazam, I see something about the FM that indicates
a level of 35.  Not sure if that's a upper or lower limit.  If it's a
lower limit...this question is moot!

Sorry for such a basic question.  Just trying to learn the ropes!
