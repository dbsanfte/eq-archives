You'd be suprised.     It's not hard to imagine situations where someone
could miss out on a few raids, or join a more advanced guild as a new
member, and end up being blocked due to having missed one of the early raids
on a mob no longer worth killing for that guild.  Grummus or Aren'dar, for
two.  You can get around it and "catch up" using the quests... but then when
the next god is killed, you can't go forward until you convince a whole
bunch of people to go back and spend thier time to get you caught up.
