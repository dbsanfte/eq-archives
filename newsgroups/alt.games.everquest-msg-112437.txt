Not knowing what the hell you are talking about I have to take the meagre
facts presented at face value. A person or persons left your guild for
greener pastures with another guild? Don't feel bad, it's not that your
guild sucks. It's not that your guild doesn't raid enough. It's not even
that your guild is a bunch of boring lame fucks. No - it's none of those...

...it's you.

Just you. No-one else.

Now that that has been stettled, can you please take your lame ass bitching
to a forum where people give a fuck about inconsequential, inane drivel like
this? May I suggest alt.lamefuck.bitching.cocksuckers?

Sometimes I wish people could be forced to un-learn touch typing - that way
we wouldn't be subjected to postings from incoherants fucks like you with
their heads up their arses.
