WS is good for two things.  Add in bestow DA and it's almost useful.

1. Moving a mob.
2. Filling in for a short time until a real tank comes along.

Many things can get you pulled out of the frontal arc not least the
mob summoning you out of it.  As you get to higher level raiding mobs
will quite happily kill you with WS up.

For a short space of time once an hour.  A Paladin can rampage tank
the entire Jelvan event with WoT and half a dozen self heals.
