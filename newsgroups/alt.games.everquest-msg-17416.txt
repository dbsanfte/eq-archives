I haven't actually tried it, but I'd assume it is the same as teleporting to a
Velious ring for which you do not have the Dragon Tooth on you.   You are
moved to the "safe spot" of the current zone you are in, without changing
zones.

There would be no CR.  You would not be able to get in.

That is why it's generally recommended that you get a couple bubbles into 46
before going... if you die a couple of times and lose your level, you will be
unable to reenter the plane to loot your corpse until you regain the level.
(either through rez, or being powerleveled by friends, since you can't kill
anything naked.)... and if you don't get your level and corpse back within 24
hours online.... *poof*
