They were strong, but they lacked the foresight to understand that if
you piss a lot of people off at the same time, they might rally
against you.  In other words, these 'civilizations' lacked the
intelligence to guide their strength, and so in a totally Darwinistic
sense, they were not fit to survive.

Strength isn't the only variable that decides who is fit to survive
and who isn't.
