That's not so much an "argument" as simply the definitions of free
will and causality at odds with each other. (Which is indeed how they
stand.) But absolute causality is an assumption, and one that is
unproven, although I'll grant that all evidence up to quantum physics
supports it... and its possible that that quantum physics will
eventually be explained in terms of cause and effect... although time
itself at the quantum level starts looking funny... so cause and
effect might not really be meaningful terms to apply there.

No. The answer to life the universe and everything is 42. <g>

/agree

For the purposes of this argument /agree
