-15 is the "base" amount, it's likely much higher with a good drum
equipped.  (Yes, I play a bard.  :-)

From the looks of the Lucy data, you're probably right.  Malos and
Malosinia have the same effects in the same "slots", but Malosinia
just has larger effects, so it'd be a classic "overwrite" situation.

The rest look pretty good.  Again according to Lucy:

Howl of Tashan:   Slot 2:  Decrease Magic Resist by 48 (L61) to 50 (L64) 
Malos:            Slot 3:  Decrease Magic Resist by 55 
Malosinia:        Slot 3:  Decrease Magic Resist by 70 
Harmony of Sound: Slot 4:  Decrease Magic Resist by 15

Malos and Malosinia obviously clash, but since HoT and HoS
put their MR debuff into different "slots", it looks as if they
should stack just fine.

I'm looking for an MR-debuff that resides in slot 1, even if it's
a minor one, but haven't found one yet.  There may not be one.

Thanks for the help.
