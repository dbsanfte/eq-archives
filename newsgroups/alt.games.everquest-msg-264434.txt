You get the message in re citizenship after every XP kill while you're
in the holding pattern.  I killed all the way up to about 170%, then
headed out.  I was at 220% when I finished the citizenship quest, and
double-dinged.

For my experience, they don't.  I hit Level 9, then killed all the way
to 10.  The creatures I was killing while L9 obviously were giving XP.
When I got 100% needed, i.e., I was now at L9 + 100%, the creatures
(Oakmyst fawns) changed to grey - no more XP from them.  I was still
Level 9.  I then went on the quest and got more XP, but stayed Level 9
until I finished the quest.
