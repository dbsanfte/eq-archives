No, there really aren't.  I cant think of any flowing thought item cheaper,
and even the ones you loot are probably not to be had by anyone <50.
There's some new stuff in ldon, but probably would cost you more effort than
what it would take to earn the cash to buy a solstice.   There's an item in
hollowshade that could be won by a group of low 40's (maybe) but has way
crappier stats than the solstice.  The solstice is basically the run3 of FT
items. <g>
