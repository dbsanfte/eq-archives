I guess I am a bit dense also.  When I first read this it had over 86
pages and I was just skimming thru.  I did not notice this connection
until I read a post after the Morsereg quote pointing out the
connection:


Quote from Dadani of Brell

Then when he kind of walked in on the situation once it was in motion,
I still didn't think too much about his involvement, because he didn't
know that the Sanornik character and I were the same person, so I
figured no harm would come of it.


Quote from Morsereg

Now, on to the Dadani situation. Dadani = Morsereg's second account.
She was just a lvl 1 mule I created to sit in the bazaar and sell shit
while I played or slept. While auctioning several nights ago, I saw
Danun (Sukliz) looking for a thurg bp MQ, and knew someone who had it
(Sanornik... who's real name is Melissa, and who's main's name is
Awelyian).


I did not find this thread as funny as most nor entertaining.  The
entire thread is spoiled with not having at difenent ending or
resolution, just speculation.
