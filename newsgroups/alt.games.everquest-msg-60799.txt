We can take this further still... well, not further, but more clarification;
no damaging roots (druids) no damaging snares (necros) no damaging
stuns (higher level cleric stuns, druid stuns...) no AOE spells with damage,
nothing with even a single point of damage can touch the mezed mobs.
Archers and people throwing need to worry about line of sight as their
target moves possibly crosssing a mezed mob.

There -are- spells that do no damage at all, and if you have any you should
be looking closely at them to see if they might be better than nominally
higher level spells that have damage.  For example, the level 5 cleric stun
(and relatively low level paladin, same spell) does no damage, making
it vastly superior to the remainder of the stun line.

Acidentally broken mez kills more people than any other single cause.
