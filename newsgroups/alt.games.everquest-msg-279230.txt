It involves a lot more than one alternate hotbar, as the spells/abilities 
get replaced multiple times as you level.  At level 36, I have at least 3 
levels of most of the spells I use, and it takes two hotbars to contain the 
spells that I use frequently, plus another hotbar to contain the spells 
that I use infrequently (I could just use them out of the book I suppose, 
but I am too lazy).  Not to mention, I also do tradeskills, including all 
the added tradeskill buffs required by the change that allowed me to make 
most of my own subcomponents.
