Going waaaaaay off topic of the group here, but ... That's a recent quote 
that Pat Robertson gave in an interview in the last week or two.  There is 
no record of Bush actually saying that, just Robertson's word for it.  Not 
to say he's right or wrong, but it's a his word against Bush's word 
situation.  And the White House says he "never said that".  It's simply 
hearsay until someone can prove otherwise.  (FYI, article on CNN here: 
http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/19/robertson.bush.iraq/)

Though it's interesting that Robertson, who supports Bush, would claim he 
said something so potentially damaging just before elections.
