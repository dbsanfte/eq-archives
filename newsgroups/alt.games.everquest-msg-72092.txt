... of gaining and losing the samn damn bb of exp!!!!! I've been playing EQ
right along with everyone else, for the better part of 2 years+ and I've
never had this much trouble just hanging on to 1 lousy bb of exp! Sheesh, I
feel like I'm a newbie newbie, and I can't even figure out why the heck I
keep dying. It isn't like I don't know how to stay alive. Darklet is a 17th
season druid  now... is it just harder at that age, or am I screwing myself
in some way?

Thoughts anyway?
