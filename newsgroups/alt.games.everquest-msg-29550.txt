And thank god for that. :)  I STILL once in awhile shudder when I think 
about what it would be like if the NPCs really *could* fight back...

(As for example 4, I think he's trying to say that when you're fighting, 
you tend to get pushed back a little, until at last you're unable to hit 
your target, although the target is still hitting you.  Simple solution, 
move forward when you notice yourself moving back.)
