Ah!  So the Qeynos faction problem is not repeated in Halas?  I remember
something about if you hand these in in Qe you get bad rogue guild faction,
which includes the corrupt guards.  Some of these guards, like their
Lutenant, are rather nasty critters.

I know there is some quest in Halas that drops White Rose faction, which is
the Rogue guild there.  A real pain since the Banker in Halas is a member of
that Rogue Guild.  I have been avoiding Gnoll Fangs in BB with a L8 Rogue
because she can't afford any Rogue faction hits.

So if Lysbith McNaff takes them with no negative hits, that will be a great
solution to that issue.
