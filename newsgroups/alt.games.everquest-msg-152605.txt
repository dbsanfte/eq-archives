That's a little warm, but it shouldn't crash.  You might want to think about
a higher-quality CPU cooler, maybe from Thermaltake or Coolermaster,
especially if you're using the one that came in the box from AMD.  Also, the
quality of your case (material, ventilation, etc.) can make a big difference
in CPU and system temps.  When I bought a new case my CPU started running 5
or 10F cooler when idle.

My computer runs hotter when running seti@home than any other program, games
included.  However, I would also be dubious about heat being the issue here
since 52C is not really an outrageous temp.
