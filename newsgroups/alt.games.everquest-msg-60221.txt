}Hmm.  I thought support characters were there to offer support. . .
}Frankly, if the casters (and some hybrids) don't make the tanks (and/or
}hybrids) feel confident, there is a problem.  Especially if the caster is a
}Cleric or and Enchanter.

Ideally, in this sense, everyone should be a support character. :)

}As a class, Enchanters are in a unique position.  They're flexible to the
}point of being a little difficult -- there's a steep learning curve.

Yep yep, I'm level 51 and -still- have a ton to learn.  Just this week 
we're in fear, and I'm learning how amazingly effective chain-stunning can 
be. :)  There's two other chanters of higher level (usually, depending on 
who's on at the moment).  The lvl 60 is doing most of the mezzing, because 
we really want it to stick the first time, the level 54 is doing most of 
the buffing (and strangely, she keeps charming things, which would make 
sense if she then sent them into combat, but she doesn't.  I don't get 
that, but it seems to be working, so... whatever. :) ), and that leaves 
me.  In the space of one pull, I'm filling in the gaps in mezzing, 
tashing, buffing, slowing if the shammies haven't shown up yet, and also 
getting some 'extra room' to try new stuff in.  And what's really worked 
suprisingly well is memming three stuns and chain-stunning the heck out of 
the glare lords and tentacle terrors... I remember after one TT having the 
tanks all say "holy crow! I didn't even lose my junk buffs!"  That really 
made me feel important. :)

}Also, the Enchanter's "crowd control" duties often carry over to "group
}control".

Yep, the drawback to the chain stunning is that, being 51, I still have a 
high resist rate, and don't always get enough mem-blurrage in there to 
avoid massive aggro.  So when the mob resists, it beats the heck out of me 
for a few seconds.  There was a scareling this afternoon that was being 
particularly tough, leading to our group cleric saying (in /gu) to our 
guildleader (also a cleric), "Mommy! Zinny's tanking again! make him 
stop!"  So I asked her when she last had to heal a tank, and we had a 
little talk about whether it was more mana-efficient to remedy me a few 
times or Cheal a tank...  Our results were inconclusive, basically 
because I think it made her sulky.  But what it really came down to was 
"healing the chanter is more stressful".  So perhaps my experiment may 
well have been more mana efficient for her, but she wasn't feeling -good- 
about it, so it may well be a bad strategy.  I'll save it for when I'm 
grouped with one of the other clerics. :)

}I maintain that my decision not to be a "Rules Lawyer" is a valid one.

It probably makes you (in my opinion) much more fun to group with.  But if 
there -is- a fundamental flaw in my strategy, that may lead to less 
deaths and more efficiency, it'd be sweet to know that.  Although, as Sang 
points out, 'less deaths' is really a less important consideration with a 
c2'ed lvl 60 cleric around and a couple necs feeding her mana. :) We tried 
Terror last night with (basically) not enough people there, and the 
carnage was unbelievable, but those two tries and the rezzes and rebuff 
and whatnot took about an hour -total-.  Big loss, especially since, even 
if we failed, trying was a hell of a blast.  So I lost 8% of a death's 
worth of exp.  Oh, ow.  It was worth it.

}in the words of my Enchanter's guild
}sponsor/mentor, "It's a fucking online game.  There is no room for drama
}here.  You're not here to be a l33t hax0r kiddie.  You're here to have fun.
}So have fun!  If you can make other people happy while you're having fun,
}you make yourself look good , you make me look good, and you make the guild
}look good."

Hehe, that seems to be our guild's whole philosophy too.  But we're a very 
small guild... Only reason we can even be in fear is that a larger guild 
invited us to join them because we're fun to have around. :)  But I 
wouldn't trade my little happy guildtag for all the loot in NToV.  (Well, 
ok, -all- the loot might be a tough one... I can switch back afterward, 
right? :)

}The point that I have made here again and again is that you and I, having
}different play styles, have very different goals.  Your idea of fun is
}learning the system, using it as efficiently as possible, and using the
}numbers to win.  That's great, and it reveals a good mind.  Enjoy it.
}That's kind of what we're here to do.  8)

}> Anyone who still believes EQ is a roleplaying game
}Reads the packaging?  *grin*

Hehe, yesterday I was on my little 18 twinkie monk in HH pass, and this 
Gnome with a red name (!!!) shows up, and roleplays the heck out of being 
a PK who is 'immune to your normal magics', and having no respect for my 
lizard butt, except insofar as I prove 'useful' to him in obtaining 
rawhide armors for his research studies.  Even if he was roleplaying 
rather an annoying person, and one who was difficult to group with 
effectively, being a wizard obsessed with his ability to 'unleash 
destructive forces' (meaning: overnuke too early when the cleric hasn't a 
prayer of healing him), we not only were able to get a bit of exp, but I 
found myself RPing as well, and it was, on the whole, at least as much fun 
per hour as camping phat lewtz in fear, possibly more.  Logging back in 
after LD to explain the dangers of trying to connect by dialup via a small 
ISP in Kunark... gee, is that ooc or not? :)
