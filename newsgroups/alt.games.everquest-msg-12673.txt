I really liked The Warrens but you have to be a lot more careful there than
anywhere else not to do too much damage.  In other words, in The Warrens
it's dangerous to have the druid do ANY direct damage (even melee).
Whereas in any other zone just as long as you counted HP damage dealt by the
newbie and kept below that, you were ok (and really speeds up the PLing).
