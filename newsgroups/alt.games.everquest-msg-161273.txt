<sigh>  Well, obviously we disagree on the basis of FACTS.  The only thing
we could do is start flinging sources at each other.  The Ballots weren't
all recounted even ONCE.  The first recount was mandated by Florida law, and
required that all the ballots be run through the machines again.  A large
number of the counties only ran through the "undercount" ballots, and not
any of the others.  Certain counties recounted by hand, but most did not,
and of those that did, many were delayed by violent demonstrations featuring
prominant national Republican Party workers and were disregarded by
Katherine Harris.

The only full manual recount that was done, was done by the press AFTER Bush
was already in office.
