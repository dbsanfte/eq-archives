Someone else also suggested this.  Have had a look and I can do dark 
blue and white cons, just!  It gets a bit sticky if root keeps failing 
early, but it is possible.  Five kills so far and no armour, but I shall 
keep plugging away at it.  1% xp per kill, which is the same as I am 
getting for a quad in Cobalt atm so I will probably swap between the 
two.  Umbral for when cobalt is busy, since in the 1.5 hrs I was there I 
only saw one other in the zone.

OK, I'll go and look up his details, thanks.
