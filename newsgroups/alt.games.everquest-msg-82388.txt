Hardly, as you now go on to say, as you finally get it . . .

Who is "finally grasping" the issue? Such a statement as that goes a long
way toward demonstrating precisely the peculiar distortion of perception
which has been among you for so long.

It's a hell of a lot more than just "basic", it's fundamental.  And contrary
to what you say, it has *everything* to do with the argument, because
honesty is the only thing that needs to be lacking in order for anyone,
whether it be  a scientist, doctor or some hooker on the street, to develop
a "pro choice" argument that denies a designation of "human" to a healthy,
whole, fertilized zygote with the DNA of homo sapiens.  If you are not
honest, you can argue any damned thing you want to, and you may very well
want to, need to, be required to in order to avoid the social stigma which
attaches to the contrary position.  If there's one thing more important that
honesty, it's social standing and the need to avoid even the slightest taint
of any appearance of inappropriate thought formation, let alone the speech
that goes to express it.

There's another thing more important than honesty and that is freedom from
guilt, for which reason it is very convenient to be able to dishonestly
split intellectual hairs about where the humanity of a person begins--it
never really works though, as like every other form of dishonest
rationalization it always comes back to haunt you, as it begins to creep out
of you in every manner of peculiar unconscious fashion:  it can make you
mean to an extreme of viciousness, because you know you are underneath it
all a killer at heart--and so your heart seeks to shrug that off on to a
scapegoat with the appearance of a worse killer than yourself; that effigy
can be any object of shared social spite, Israel and Sharon, any object that
meets the criterion for being altogether as inappropriate a target as the
reason for needing it in the first place:  it must be an object that is in
fact innocent of the opprobrium that you would heap upon it, or it's no
good--it has to fit the image of your other victim, the unborn infant, the
Christ, the Jew, the Christian.  The Palestinian would never do because what
he does is too much like what you do, for is not abortion quite like a
suicide bombing?  Certainly because it kills you; your own offspring; your
flesh and blood and tissue.

It's truly bizarre the way these unconscious repressions come out, both
individually and socially, how they are always coming out in little, totally
ass-backward hateful subliminal flashes of opinion and attitude which are
the messages of guilt repression.  No matter how carefully devised is the
nest of lies you have woven out of that filthy fabric of split-hairs to wear
on your head like a stocking cap or a backward baseball cap--it's just no
good because the truth is so cold and penetrating, that it just goes right
through the weave, both ways, in and out:  it comes out like poisoned air in
your art.  See for example the film that was on the Sci-Fi Channel tonight
with Jennifer Jason Leigh, "eXistenz".

I almost never watch that channel, but flipping through it from time to
time, one can't help but make note of this bizarre contemporary sci-fi
cinematic fetish for all these gooey looking excrescences that keep showing
up on film in the form of little gremlins of every size and shape.  Tonight,
at last, I perceived the Freudian symbolism in that stuff--as it is now
showing itself forth in the unconscious projections, the Durkheimian
*conscience collectif* of every generation born since Roe v. Wade.  It's
just the sort of thing you Gen-Xers have oozing around in your heads and
popping out like pimple juice in your art.  The very thing you have kept
buried down in the darkest archetypal depths of your collective
unconsciousness, being squeezed out in all these movies and upon the
triggers in every High School Mass Shooting, it's all that dark, gooey wrath
in that muttering hiphop chant of lunacy you call "music"

You watch the utterly orgiastic expression on Ms Leigh's face (and she has
been for some time, in my view, one of the few young actresses that is worth
a damn) when she is shooting somebody--and you see in that fantastically
crazed expression, all the sensuality of a human ego in the rarely
recognized state of expressing the righteousness of evil--it's how people
look when they fully know somewhere down inside the absolute wrongness of
what they do, and yet at the same time you are giving full vent to that
ethically blind Id animal down inside with its volcanically explosive need
to say, despite the Super Ego's knowledge, "I am justified. I deny the
guilt!  I get to do what I want."  Every murder of passion is done in that
state of mind, every act of hair-splitting dishonesty is backed by that same
passion, and there is no arguing with you about it.
