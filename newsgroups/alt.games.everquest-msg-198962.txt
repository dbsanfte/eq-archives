Actually, I've stopped the KEI game alltogether.  I KEI guildies in casting
range - for free, of course, I've never charged a guildie and never shall -
and if I see someone charging outrageously for KEI I'll start buffing for
free just to piss 'em off.  But I stopped whoring KEI over this very issue;
I made back the 45K I paid for KEI by selling high-end pottery items.
Anyone need a spiritstone?
