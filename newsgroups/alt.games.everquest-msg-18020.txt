I am having problems with Divine Aura and the lvl 2 Cleric I am
trying at the moment.  Bought the spell, scribed it and tried to
memorise it.  I got the "you have finished memorising Divine Aura"
but no icon appears in the spell slot. When I try clicking on
that slot I keep getting " You have not recovered"
Any ideas!?
