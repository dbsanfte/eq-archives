Yes, that's the odious part, all right. You've identified it
perfectly.

The difficulty is that some seem to assume the first two parts of the
equation are correct, and are remarkably unwilling to even consider
otherwise.

For my own use, I'd rewrite the above as:

I have found a way.
That way works for me.
Mine is not the only way.
If you're interested, ask me and I'll consider talking about it.
If you're not interested, then I won't pester you, and I'd appreciate
the same courtesy.
