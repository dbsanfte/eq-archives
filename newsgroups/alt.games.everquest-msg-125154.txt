Well, actually I live below the Polar Circle. But I just wanted to
remind Tim that the sun has this nasty habit of rising at wildly
disparate times of the day in certain parts of the world, and that
this way of doing things would be less than perfect there. The worst
would be to work on the actual North Pole, where the longest day of
the year actually lasts nearly 190 days.

And yes, i do believe that my contract not only specifies how long
my work day is, but also that if I work overtime, I am guaranteed
that the overtime won't exceed a certain number of hours, and that
I'll be allowed a certain amount of hours rest before I next have
to go to work. Hmm, I think that it's something like 10 hours rest,
although that rule often gets bent a bit...
