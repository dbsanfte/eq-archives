As someone who left UO after 3.5 years of playing, either solely on
the PvP side of the game, or when the game was a pure PvP environment,
I am glad that I DON'T play on the PvP servers.  Grief play, while not
as prevelant in EQ as it was in UO, is still an issue on the blue
servers.  And from what I have seen of the PvP servers, it is far
worse there.

True, not everyone gets their rocks off ganking a new character.  Just
75% or so of the population.  I guess that makes them feel truly
superior.  PvP at its' finest.

As possibly one of the top 20 of all time PK's on UO, it isn't fear,
or lack of challange that keeps me away from PvP servers.  It is
boredom.  All the kewl d00d l33t's, or Ubers, as they are called in
this game, are boring.  Same smack talk, because they were fortunate
to be there first.  How many times do you think someone can stand to
see

ha ha, I roxxered your newb ass...

How many times can you stand to say it?
