To me, it's not a question of how good EQ 2 will be.  I enjoy playing EQ, 
and I have spent a huge amount of time getting my main to where he is.  I 
intend to continue playing EQ even after EQ 2 comes out because I still 
enjoy it quite a bit.  Who knows, EQ2 could very well be much better.  If 
most of my friends in EQ take the plunge, then, I may do so as well.
