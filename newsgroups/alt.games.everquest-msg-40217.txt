That's weird alright.  Are you SURE you checked BOTH race and class?  I
don't think you could have bought deity specific armor from a vendor, and
there's no such thing as evil only armor.  If the armor truly says dwarves
and warriors can wear then you should type /bug and give a bug report and
then /petition a gm to fix it so you can wear it or give you your money
back.  Because you definitely should be able to shop and tell if something
fits you or not.  If you can't that is a bug in the game.
