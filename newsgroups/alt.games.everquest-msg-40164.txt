Dont loose time doing crapy quest for low wis items.
Do xp as much as you can, level quick. when you reach 30,
you should have 200pp with regular loot. at 34, you become
a true healer and can group with higher players than you and you can try
good loot camps
like CC in partner with a warrior or monk. Sell stuff you loot there and you
cn reach 2k before you hit 40.
Keep cash for your spells (dont forget) and buy mojor wis items like 6wis
rings, CGS 9wis, Veil 7 or 8 wis, adamantite epaulet, etc ...
You gonna level really quicker with a crappy equip and as soon you have cash
to buy a good piece of equip, your wisdom will increase really quicly.

400pp :  2 x 6 wis ring
400pp    CGS 9 wis
400pp    veil 7 wis
400pp    2 x RMB 5wis
1600pp  +38 wis

in CC : rygor oracle cloak 2 or 3 wis
          crystaline belt 3 wis


at 39+ go to SolB and try to get a seat in rares room for good auctionnable
loots
           or simply Rygorr fort (really good spot for loot)

at rygorr fort : gauntlet of the black  wis 3 or 4
                     rygorr armor to sell for cash

And you can auction for rez to make extra monney because spells and reagents
for symbols r expensive.
At low level, low wisdom = quicly fm :)
If you have to burn a full mana bar on a fight, so it s time to find a
better puller or better balanced group !
