Yes, I thought that when I read the article.  Sounds like he didn't
actually bother reading it, if he considers an article dealing with
the systems/operations "hype."

Still, we must be tolerant of (yet another) Born-Again MMORPG'er who
has seen the Gaming Light and froths on behalf of (yet another)

there'll be some other game to froth over   ;)
