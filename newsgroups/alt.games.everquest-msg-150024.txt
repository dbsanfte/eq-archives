No.  That was a rumor for a while, but it has been
confirmed (through extensive testing, and admissions
by the Verant folks) that:

1.  The highest of INT/WIS/XXX determines your
skill-up rate.  (XXX is DEX for fletching, STR for
smithing, and unknown or non-existent for other
tradeskills.)

2.  The only thing that affects your success rate
is your current skill level for that tradeskill,
versus the "trivial" level for the item you're
trying to make.  Period.
