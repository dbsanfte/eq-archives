    Depends when you started and who you are. I got smithing to banded
trivial before the changes to trivials, and earned another 5 points doing
Fine Steel Plate for various alts of friends. So 180 skill. Then I got an
item which gives +15% to Blacksmithing (there's two such items in game, one
in Vex Thal and one in Ssra). So an effective skill of 207, which means most
of the old dwarven cultural stuff is effectively trivial. I have the Earthen
Tempers in the bank, and I'm just waiting for a guild ENC to get bored so I
can replace my warrior's crafted pieces. =)
