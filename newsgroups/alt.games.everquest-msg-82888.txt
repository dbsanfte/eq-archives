	I think I was out of Stonebrunt by 24...it's hard to remember.  I
generally play him alongside an RL friend's Ranger these days.  Around 24 she
got bored with Stonebrunt and wanted us to move to Cazic.

	Around that level, maybe 22 or 23, when I was there solo, I was pulling
the catfishers off the docks.  (Now that I think back, I'm 99% certain I
dinged 24 doing just that...I wanted to hit the spell level before we moved.)
When I was with Tuvili, we set up at a niche along the side of the mountain
going left from the Warrens...I forget the /loc.  Few if any wanderers, I
could have soloed there easily.
