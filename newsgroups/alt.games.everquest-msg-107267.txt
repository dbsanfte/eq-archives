LOL I stare back if they don't speak. If they do, I *always* answer
them. I say "Hello" and smile. I do *not* SoW them, or heal them, or
anything else automatically. After all, they haven't asked for anything;
how the hell am I supposed to know what they want? I'm a druid, not Miss
Cleo, fer cryin' out loud! /evil grin A few will actually start a
conversation; those will get a SoW, and maybe other buffs if I have
plenty of mana and nothing else to do. Some will respond "sow plz"; for
those, I have a "/em pulls a small, squealing, female piggy from her
backpack and hands it to %T" hotkey. And a surprising number will simply
not say anything more and go away. =P
