    If you want low, easy blues to solo, try Dawnshroud near Netherbian Lair 
zone. Set up on the zone wall, on the side opposite the patch of mushrooms 
(so right hand side facing out from Neth zone), and run forwards to find 
stuff to pull. Lots of very easy zelniaks, wolves are tougher but you should 
still be able to handle them. It would help if you brought a SoW potion 
along - there's very fast green mobs (Lightcrawlers) that can aggro which 
are really annoying if you can't outrun them and bring them to Jobaber to 
kill.
