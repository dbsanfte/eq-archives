No, even with many, many people in your vicinity doing their thing it's
fine most of the time [1]. Having a low ping isn't nearly as important
as it is in FPS games.

Snap. EQ is vastly more sedate than FPS games, like you'd expect, but it
can be just as exciting and addictive.

With my ageing system and distance from the EQ 'Merkin servers, I get
pings of around 250-300ms, which has never been a problem; no mob will
take your head off with an AWP before you so much as register them.

[1] It is still wise to disable various messages in your text buffer and
disable/cut down particle effects and your clip plane when things get
busy. A command in the game:  " /serverfilter on " will stop the types
of messages you've disabled in your client from even being sent to you,
reducing lag.
