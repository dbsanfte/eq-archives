    The information is laid out quite nicely. Good work, J!

    *cringe* Let me guess - she liked the helm, the BP, and the legs because
they had more WIS than what she has now. Jakugg, you HAVE to impress upon
her the importance of AC/HP gear. For example, those arms she likely doesn't
want have one less WIS than she has now - but also have more than 10 AC
more, and 35 HPs. When things hit the fan she needs to be able to take hits
while casting small heals on people like enchanters, bards and shamans who
are the only people who can turn a wipeout into a victory. She should also
look at a mana calculator - those gloves give her more total mana than
Gauntlets of the Black ever could, even at level 60. The only pieces she
should consider passing on are the boots (the gem for them is highly sought
after - check the tables to see why - and expensive) and the bracer, and
she'll likely get a bracer anyways because the other plate classes need the
same gems for them as she did for the boots.

    If I see one more person roll on something, then say "What did I just
win?" I'll snap.

    Good. No need for groovy graphics on pure information pages. 8)

    I think you'd find that most uberguilds agree about how good Thurg
armour is. You really do need something of Thurg/PoG/Kunark quality on your
tanks before farming ToV armour, and Thurg/PoG has the useful stats, HPs and
especially resists on it that Kunark doesn't.
