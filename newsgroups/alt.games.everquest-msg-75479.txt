I don't believe you lose the skill points...  However, if you have already
spent them with the trainer getting new skills that you would have just
acquired at your new level, you will lose the ability to use those skills
until you regain your new level again.

Also, if you get new spells at your new level, you scribe them, mem them,
die, lose level...  Your new spells will remain scribed, but you will be
unable to mem them again until regaining your new level.
