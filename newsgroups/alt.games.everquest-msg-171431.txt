I saw a level 20 guild cleric in Pal and decided to see what the hubbub was 
about over there and asked them if they wanted a partner.  I ran over there 
( was level 20 ) and joined them and their 4 friends to make a full group 
at "camp 1", the closest camp to the SH zone.

It was sick.  Horrible.  Nasty.  Just plain... wrong.  The EXP rolled in so 
quickly I would look and think I had 2.5 yellows and then realize it was 
3.5.  I stayed until I was halfway through 22 and couldn't take it anymore 
and joined a Vox raid with my main.
