As an avid pine user I can tell you that yes, you can "plonk" users.  Pine
actually has pretty good filtering features.

If you go to the Main Menu, (M) then Setup (S) then Roles (R) then filters
(F)

Set the Content Type to News.
then set your criteria under "FILTERED MESSAGE CONDITIONS BEGIN HERE"

you can filter by a whole bunch of options, though you will most likely
want the From.  Simply put in the persons nane or e-mail address and you
have set it to filter those news messages.

Then you need to go down under "ACTIONS BEGIN HERE"
and the first heading is "Filter Action"

Select delete.  And poof, all done.

You should also look into Roles, those can be pretty sweet too.

Have fun! :)
