Yes, but, the userbase increasing would not affect the per user bandwidth 
usage.  If bandwidth usage doubles, and, at the same time, the userbase 
doubles, then, they are still taking in the same amount of money per MB 
of bandwidth used.  The bandwidth per user would need to increase 
significantly in order to correctly justify a cost increase based on 
that.  I am not complaining at the cost increase personally, I still feel 
that I am getting excellent value for the money I spend.
