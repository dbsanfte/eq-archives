Hi

I used to be able to put item links into my socials by editing the
.ini file and adding the control char item# item name control-char.
But, since one of the patchs this week (not sure if it was the big one
or the small), it somes up looking like a link, but doesn't work.

For example, if I put ...  [ASCII18]0017969Hand Made Backpack[ASCII18]

I get what appears to be a link titled ... e Backpack

And, of course, it doesn't work.

Any ideas?

--Kevin
