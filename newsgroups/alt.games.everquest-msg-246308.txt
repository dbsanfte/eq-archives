Have you found that there are decidedly *few* tankers? My gut level
perception is that the ratio goes something like:

Blasters        50%
Controllers    25%
Defenders     10%
Scrappers     10%
Tankers          5%

My level 20 Empathy Defender has been in many groups of 7 blasters lol.

Glad to see you made a Tanker, hope to hook up with him some time and see
how the tanker/controller option works. My Empathy healer keeps hoping to
find a Tanker in groups and I just don't see many.

Illusion Controllers are said to be one of the better classes for soloing at
the high levels because of their extraordinary pet powers but without a
healing capability I'm not sure how viable that really is, so I'm thinking
of adding the Healing pooled power set. I added Storm as my Secondary to
gain some crowd control for grouping, so I'm looking forward to seeing how
well this Hero plays out across the board.
