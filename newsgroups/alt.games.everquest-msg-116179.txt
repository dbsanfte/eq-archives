Because it dosent matter . In a free and open buisness enviroment the best
product rises to the top eventually. What microsoft had going for it was
2-fold . The product is extremely easy to install and use, and the platform
it was made for was a competitive market so that it constantly sees upgrades
and price lowering.

Macintosh was a similiar operating system but they kept the platform closed
and thus much more expensive. The vax operating system was obnoxious to
learn how to use and was not designed for personal computers. Microsoft will
not stay dominant forever or even for very much longer. What people do not
understand is that the personal computer industry is still only 20 years
old.
