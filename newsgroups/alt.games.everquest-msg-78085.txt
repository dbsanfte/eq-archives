simple and easy ingame

or mess with it in your eqclient.ini file (I didn't write this btw):
[TextColors]
- Oooh, pretty colors!  Change these colors in-game using /usercolor
<channel code> <red> <green> <blue>.  Using the RGB color code (0 - 255).  0
0 0 for black, 255 255 255 for white, 255 0 0 for bright red, 0 255 0 for
bright green, 0 0 255 for bright blue.  I hope you get the idea.  The
channel codes are:
1- Say
2- Tell
3- Group
4- Guild
5- OOC
6- AUC
7- SHOUT
8- Emote
9- Spells (your casting, spell hitting, interuptions, scribing, meming)
10- You hit other
11- Other hits you
12- You miss other
13- Other misses you
14- Broadcasts (duel, motd, server GM broadcasts)
15- Skills (taunt, sense heading, skill level-ups, disarm, etc.)
16- Disciplines
17- Unused
18- Default (your typing in the pop-up carriage, etc.)
19- Unused
20- Merchant offer price
21- Merchant buy/sell
22- Your death messages
23- Other death messages (mob, other player, even a GM *chuckles*)
24- Other damages other
25- Other misses other
26- /who list
27- /yell
28- Hit for non-melee messages
29- Spell worn off
30- Money splits
31- Loot messages
32- /random
33- Other's spells
34- Spell failures (resists, fizzles, spell recovery time)
