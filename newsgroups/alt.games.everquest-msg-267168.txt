    Most corporations do pay a monthly fee for support and the expansion 
packs are
the new versions. This business model might be selling apples to your 
example of selling
oranges but that doesn't invalidate the model from being applied to oranges 
successfully.

    Now you could still not have OoW(XP) or GoD(2000), or LDoN(NT) but I bet 
your still paying
a monthly support fee for LoY(Win95). And when Sony(Microsoft) suddenly 
announces a new all inclusive
upgrade path Platinum(XP) for a suddenly low price you say hey maybe I 
should, just to get the latest.
You then don't just chuck your monthly support out the window.

     Microsoft went through their period of  releasing product not ready, 
buggy and sometimes in some
weird direction(ME). I really don't see much difference in any large 
successful software house from Sony.
I have always paid for monthly support, always faced having to upgrade to 
the newest version to get the new
content (and usually receive ton'o'bugs as well). Yes I can choose to not 
pay for support I also can choose to play
by myself and tell all my customers we just don't offer that or I have a bug 
that they just will have to live with.

    Now start a thread on someone needing to sue a software company for 
breach of contract when said paid software does not do the things they 
stated it would and I will join you on your soapbox.
