You'd be suprised.  Minimum on 'em seems to be a few pp from the get-go, 
unless you get your pottery high enough to make the poison vials, in 
which case you'll save a bit of coin.  Tradeoff being that you have to 
farm an old world skin for every combine and they trivial in the 160s.

Give you gf access and a budget and have her do it *grin*.

Check eqtraders.  They have a make poison section with some nice links.  
From what I hear a lot of the PoP poisons are very nice.

You "apply poison" to a piercing weapon.  Yes, you can fail on this, and 
yes, the poison poofs when you do.  It also takes 7 seconds to apply the 
poison, and it forces you to sit while you do it, sounds kinda like bind 
wounds.  Supposedly with higher skill in this area it will cut the time 
down a bit.  Then when the weapon is in your primary hand it has a chance 
to proc that poison.  The site below says something about being able to 
apply poison to a weapon ahead of time and swap it out when you need the 
proc or something.  Not sure how that works, or if you can keep multiple 
weapons each with a different poison on 'em.

from: http://kikyara.tripod.com/basics.html
The poison wears off (your weapon) when:
you leave the zone 
you are disconnected 
you camp 

The duration of the poison's effect on the target varies by poison and by 
level.

Check the safehouse forums as well.

I've heard rumors that the skillup checks on this stuff use DEX as a 
secondary check (much like fletching), but I've also heard that's BS and 
you need to invest in a set of WIS/INT gear and have KEI up while 
tradeskilling as a rogue.

I'm not really looking forward to doing all this on my rogue, but it does 
sound pretty useful.
