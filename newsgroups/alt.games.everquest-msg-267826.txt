I think the difference between your normal Game I, Game II, Game III and 
the EQ I, EQ II thing is that SOE thinks EQ is a seperate game that 
people will still not only play due to not wanting to spend on the 
upgrade, but due to it being different in type.

Similar, perhaps, to someone buying LOE and playing it at the same time, 
or instead of, EQ I, or vice versa.

I don't think thats a very strong arguement; both are fantasy RPG 
MMOG's, difference is in style and perhaps graphic quality, rather than 
type.  But I think its the one that's being made when people keep saying 
that the two games are different and need their own groups, while Diablo 
I and II did not (because in that case, Diablo II took over the flagship 
position, and Diablo I became just an old legacy game)
