I'm pretty sure that they still consider that an exploit. I know a
friend of mine got a warning in ToFS for fear kiting mobs into the
wall at zone-in there. Strangely enough, they don't seem to consider
it an exploit if you pull to the same spots so a mob doesn't get a
chance to run when it gets low on hitpoints. Either that or I just got
lucky with a guide that time <g>. 

Just an option, but you might consider SolB Kobolds. You can use that
same splitting strategy at the zone line between SolA and B. Works
even better if you root one mob at the zone line, then zone out. You
also never have to worry about eating a death due to someone being in
your way there.  Heck, you might not even need to split em given your
level of twinkage. 

Rgds, Frank
