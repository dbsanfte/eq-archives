Probably won't help much, but for what it's worth, I was recently doing exp
grind in Lower Guk with a partner in the safe hall.  A monk comes in there
pulling the lighter cons from the other side.  He made TONS of battle spam,
but the froggie ghouls were still getting their hits in.  Not enough to
cause him any down time, but they were hitting.  So a successful attack from
that monk couldn't have been resetting the ghouls' delay timers, as his
delay was much shorter than theirs . . . if it did work that way, they would
have always almost gotten their turn to attack, when his delay would have
cycled and he would have reset their delay timers again with yet another
successful attack.
