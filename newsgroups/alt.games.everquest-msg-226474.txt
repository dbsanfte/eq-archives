Im still at a loss how this helped anyone, care to expand on that?

Gimping a whole class of players is the worst possible way to "help"
others.  I maintain you leave a game as is and the players will pick
the classes that fit the game best. Changing rules in a way that
negates the choices and time investment players made over months even
years isnt just bad game design its cruel. Looking back thats when EQ
stopped being fun for a lot of us imho.

Couldnt agree more on this but it exists because they have ignored the
problem since before PoP. This latest slight of hand may be an
admission that they cant find a way to fix it.

My War had about the same results but the problem is that players
perceive that War cant hold agro therefore problems getting a group.
Also since equipment plays such a great role in a war holding agro the
results are going to be very mixed and you cant really fault the
players. 

I contend the whole idea of classes that had no spells (pure melee)
was flawed. Certainly seems to be at this point and after playing
games where all classes are casters. Balance is much less of an issue
in those games and the "tank" classes find it easier to adjust to
situations. Perhaps this should be the real point of discussion.
