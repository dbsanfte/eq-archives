Hey, I started playing again

- right after the patch
- an hour after the patch
- this morning after I woke up

and I noticed that when I

- fought something
- went to <zone>
- tried to make a <tradeskill item>

that somehow

- I couldn't hit worth shit
- I failed 5000 times without a skill increase
- the spiders stopped dropping silks
- the hill giants all gave me wedgies and sent me home

Did Verant nerf

- this
- that
- the other

?

Thanks,

--
