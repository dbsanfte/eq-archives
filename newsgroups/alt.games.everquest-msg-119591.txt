I have been very successful soloing the Sulking Brutes in the Cave that
leads to Dalnir from lvl 27 to lvl 30 with my necro.  There is a two spawn
room (the one that leads to Dalnir's Crypt) and a three spawn room.  The
Brutes do not help each other, and it's a static 15 minute respawn.

Finding the cave entrance is a pain.  I finally had to do a /loc down to the
single digits to find it with any degree of success.  The /loc is pos 3510
pos 3960.

Good Luck
