From the talk from Artifact about Horizons, they're shooting at
overall world focus, with the Withered Aegis(SP? Just WA. ;P)
constantly encroaching on civilized lands if not kept in check. The
focus they're aiming for is to give players a unified interest in
protecting the world from a spread of corruption, if for nothing else,
to protect the resource regions from being overrun by undead. It's not
something that a single player or group is going to be able to be
successful at, by the sound of it.

Whether or not they successfully implement this concept, it's still
wait and see. The game's live, yeah, but everyone's still in the early
stages. We'll see in a few months how well they pull it off.
