I know it's a hard concept to figure out, but work with me. Toilet.
John. That porcelin bowl with water that flushes down a hole when you
pull down this little lever.

The cat, once trained (which was done in a matter of a couple weeks)
used the toilet EVERY TIME. Never a single mess to clean up, and this
was an indoor cat. 

"Cats can't be trained" is bull. It's not that they can't figure out
stupid tricks. It's that they have better things to do. ><

Man: Fetch the stick, Fluffy!
Fluffy: Get your own damn stick, you threw it away.
