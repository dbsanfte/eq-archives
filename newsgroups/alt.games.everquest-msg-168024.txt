At the very least, it can make your guild a lot of money and/or spells you
can't kill for yourself

You should, reward your monks :)

He's easier than Vindi.  Does that help?

Named rat in DN.  Killable with a handfull of people, and drops the
willsapper

I don't know how to rate zland..  compared to other first broods, he really
is gimp.

Hmm.. Imo a guild that can comfortably kill Vindi can kill Zlandi, although
it is a very different fight (ae fear and.. rotting flesh? a resistable dot)
He has really nice loot though,  ST key, Cowl of mortality, heart of zland
etc :)

What about innie?  His loot is kinda trashy (even for a guild <vindi) but
hes still "a boss/god"
