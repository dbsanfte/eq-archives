For monks I can suggest practicing Instill Doubt while feigned. It still 
runs a skill check, and you don't draw suspicions of the overly eager to 
petition you morons when you practice it while afk.
Also one can add mend, sneak, sense heading and FD itself to it. Long as 
you make sure you don't stand up, it will look like an afk monk playing 
dead. None of the other abilities will produce any visible effect
