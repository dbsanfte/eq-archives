Very well said.  Monks and myself would love SONY to actually tell us what
the class we play is meant to be.

The following was posted on teh Official Monk Forum at EQLIVE.  It was
written by Xaynn.

"Originally, prior to Kunark back when the level cap was 50, Monks were
envisioned as "light tanks" capable of very high DPS.  They had a very
limited selection of gear.  So limited, in fact, that many chose to use
their naked fists over any weapon.  Look at the pre-Kunark armor that was
available for monks:  Silk, Cured Silk, Mesh, Netted, and Shivercrap when
the original Planes came out.  I honestly don't remember when Wu's became
available, but I think it was after Kunark.

This lack of gear was offset by innate abilities, namely much higher skill
caps, and reinforced with a weight limit that gave an ( at the time )
appreciable AC boost.

Lets look at the lvl 50 skill caps so you can see how a monk made up for not
having any gear by using his "skill".  We'll include BstLrds for comparison
purposes, even though they didn't exist at the time.

As these numbers clearly show, Monks were the most "skilled" of any
melee/hybrid.  In some cases by a huge margin: 50 points in Dodge ( 33%
better than nearest ), 42 points in Dual Wield ( 25% better than nearest ),
40 points in 1HB/2HB ( 20% better than nearest ), 20 points in Defense over
a Warrior.

Also remember that the damage a monk does with his naked fists increases
with his level.  No other class had or has this ( though, honestly, I'm
unsure of BstLrds ).

I don't believe that there were different damage tables or different defense
tables at this time.  It's my belief that differences in performance were
accomplished by means of the differences in skill caps.  There was no such
thing as a "Leather Class" or a "Plate Class".  Proof of this is Old World
items with Plate Graphic that are monk equipable.  Items were individually
determined to be appropriate or inappropriate for each class/race on an item
by item basis.

...Enter Kunark.

With Kunark, the level cap was raised to 60.  Because so many of the game
mechanics at that point were based on skill caps, the natural move was to
increase them with the new level.  However, there was a software limitation
at the time that prevented any skill cap over 252.  It was the same
limitation that prevented stats from going over 255 and that caused resists
over 255 to actually roll over into the negatives ( although still
displaying a positive number ).  The last two problems have since been
addressed with stats going as high as 355 and resists going as high as 500+
( before they lose additional meaning ).

Again, BstLrds did not exist at this time and are only included for
comparison purposes.

As these numbers clearly show, Monks lost the majority of their "skill"
advantage, almost across the board.  To offset this, Verant created "Monk
Damage" tables.  I do not know if BstLrds have access to these tables or
not, but if they do, then I personally find some of their % gains from 50 to
60 incongruous to say the least, specifically in Offense, Block, Riposte,
and Hand to Hand.

Later, all melee were moved to the monk offense tables and monks were given
even better offense tables.

Thus began the devaluation of skill caps and the loss of their meaning
relative to each other across classes.  A Monk's offensive skill is
meaningless when compared to any other class's because that number
represents the monk's placement on his class specific table.  Without
knowing the values in that table compared to the table used by the class
against which the monk is being compared, no valid comparison based on skill
cap alone can be made.

I don't believe that separate defensive tables had yet been created.

...Enter Velious and Luclin

These expansions' major flaw was a lack of attention paid to itemization,
and specifically how those items would affect a class defined in part on
it's relative lack of gear comparable to that obtainable by other classes.

Monks were never "supposed" to get gear with AC levels comparable to gear
that Warriors could obtain.  But we did.  And because defense was still
based on skill caps, we out performed them at any given AC level, as we
should have based on skill.

Further complicating this was the fact that the most commonly encountered
softcap in these two expansions was around 1400AC, which was obtainable by
both Upper end Monks and Warriors.  Once either class achieved this "magic
number", other avenues of toon improvement yielded greater benefits than
increasing AC did.  And once that "magic number" was reached, Monks still
had a skill based avoidance advantage due to Block being more effective than
Parry ( approx 14% at max skill for both ).

Also introduced in Velious was the idea of "armor types".  Originally
designed as a method of reducing raid item rottage, by increasing the number
of classes that could use each drop ( as opposed to having a necro robe
drop, a quest item would drop which could be used by a
necro/chanter/mage/wizard ), the idea caught on with the players.  Druids
and Monks ( and later BstLrds ) became "Leather Classes" because their quest
pieces had the word "Leather" in them.  Warriors/Clerics/SKs/Pallies/Bards
became "Plate Classes",  Shaman/Rogues/Rangers became "Chain Classes" and
the Int Casters became "Silk Classes".

These divisions blatantly ignored the fact that previously there were pieces
of armor of each "type" that each class could wear.  In fact many monks at
the time actually preferred "Cloth" based armor to "Leather" based due to
weight consideratons.  Some monks still prefer the Cloth graphic chest over
the leather for purely asthetic reasons.

It also completely ignored the fact that nothing about the groupings made
any sense from a "defensive" point of view.  What do a Shaman, a Rogue, and
a Ranger have in common defensively?  What defensive characteristics do
Warriors and Bards and Clerics share?  Let alone a Druid and a Monk.

But the idea had caught on.

Lastly, it was during this time that SoE obtained Verant.  While Verant may
have had many flaws in their managment and customer communication, one thing
they had was a Vision(tm).  Each class had a definition and a purpose.
Players may have disagreed with the Vision(tm) and/or it's implementation
( and did often and sometimes quite loudly ), but it was there and it was
comforting on a certain level.

SoE had no Vision(tm).  Inspiration, perhaps, albeit most often fueled by a
seemingly ravenous need to increase revenue even at the cost of Customer
Service, but there was no observable cohesive unifying force for consistency
in such matters as "class definition" or "class balance".

...Enter Planes of Power ( PoP ) almost...

Prior to the release of PoP, several areas were identified as "problems".
One was unlimited mana for raid encounters via droppable mod rods.  One was
the  concept of an unlimited "Complete" heal.  One was the monopolization of
certain then desirable content via the use of manaburn.

And one was the fact that in certain cases, Upper end Monks were
outperforming comparably equipped Warriors, defensively as well as
offensively.

The answer SoE devised to the last problem was to put monks on their own
defensive table.  After all, they were a "Leather Class" and the table idea
had worked out so well when applied to offense, why shouldn't it work when
applied to defense?

The problem was that they over adjusted.  They recognized this within about
2 months and then partially reversed it, most likely by gradually increasing
the values on the new table until they reached a point of being "close
enough".

It's my belief that when they discovered their "fix" didn't actually address
the "problem", they also stealth implemented a drastic reduction in
effective AC gains beyond the soft cap.  Drastic to the tune of 40 displayed
AC yielding the benefits previously associated with 1 AC pre-soft cap, while
warriors still gained 1 real for every 4 displayed post soft cap.  Whether
Monks and Warriors actually share the same softcap for any given ATK level
or not, I do not know.  I do, however, know ours is a much harder soft cap
than their's.  Possibly harder than any other class's except perhaps the Int
Casters.

Eventually, all classes were moved to separate defensive tables, most
probably based on their "armor type", though Bards do not seem to mitigate
near as well as other plate based hybrids at comparable AC levels, despite
having identical defense skillcaps.

Perhaps the division was more along the lines of Tank/Other/Monk, with Bards
being in the "Other" category.

Warriors eventually got an innate mitigation bonus.  Whether this was
implemented via a separate table or simply as a class modifier to the
existing table, I have no clue.

In any case, the final validity of any skill cap was removed from all melee
considerations.  Each class or subset of classes had its own table.  The
skill levels only matter within the confines of that table and have no
relation whatsoever to the skill caps of any class not on the same table.

And a class that had been in part defined as being competitive through
"skills" as opposed to "equipment" lost a major part of its definition.
Monks now had to find gear that allowed them to compete.  Every meaningful
defensive AA is available to all classes ( CS/ID/CA/LR ), even the Int
Casters.  The only thing left was gear.

Except that their definition had changed into something that was never ever
"supposed" to compete as a tank.  Nor were we "supposed" to compete as pure
DPS.  And it was gear that had caused these definition changes in the first
place.

Leaving us with the role of puller, which was something even Verant had said
we were never "supposed" to be.

The game has changed around us.  We've been put on separate offense tables
to compensate for the devaluation of our skills as well as separate defense
tables to correct our having been allowed to obtain gear that we shouldn't
have.

Balancing our melee means considering our tables vs the tables of all the
other classes at various equipment levels for all test subjects.  A task at
least an order of magnitude more difficult than simply adjusting our skill
caps.

Balancing our utility means giving us abilities that in part currently
define other classes while still keeping us true to the "pure melee" ideal.
Abilities that when combined with our current utility don't allow "game
breaking" exploits, despite such "accidents" happening repeatedly for other
classes ( AE Kiting, Charm Kiting, Charm Exploits, Manaburn, etc ) and
taking sometimes several months or more for even an attempt at a "fix" to be
put into place.

It's my honest opinion that Monks are broken because we were based on a part
of the game that has long since been obsoleted.  We were based on "skills".
Those skills are now buried in some hidden set of tables that differ
possibly quite dramatically based on class.

It's also my honest opinion that Monks are still broken because no one at
SoE understands what we were originally, and what we've since become, well
enough to figure out what we should be, let alone figure out exactly how to
fix us.

It's my fear that they don't even care any more when so relatively few of us
are left and the overwhelming opinion seems to be that EQ itself no longer
matters in the face of such things as EQ2, CoH, and WoW, let alone given the
fact that it's now a 5 year old game that has been pushed so far past it's
original goal that it seems in some ways to be on the verge of collapse at
any moment.

It sure would be nice to hear different.

It would be even better to see proof.

I feel the worst for those that have already given up, because it didn't
have to be like this.

Or maybe it's envy that I feel for them.
