There is a difference between "playing a role" and "making excuses"
that seems to escape an awful lot of people.  To play a role you
submerge your wants/needs/attitudes beneath those of the character
you are seeking to portray.  OTOH, inventing an RP excuse for doing
what you're going to do anyway is no different from any other sort
of behavior rationalization, so unless the role you are playing is
that of self-absorbed ass it amounts to pretending to roleplay rather
than roleplaying.  That is not to say that either of these (RPing a
self-absorbed ass or pretending to roleplay) cannot be fun, but I'll
hazard a guess that a "Team Manaburn" that goes out assassinating
dragons and kings for raw profit is most likely to be a crew of
self-interested jerks who quite frankly don't give a damn about
either how their actions might impact other players or roleplaying.
