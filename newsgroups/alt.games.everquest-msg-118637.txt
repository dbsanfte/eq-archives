I get disconnected about once every 10-15 minutes.  It's not a set interval,
but it is quiet steady in the fact that it happens very often.  I don't get
disconnected from my ISP, just from everquest.. I'm thinking maybe it's my
modem.. cause my laptop can stay connected to EQ though.. it might possibly
be the phone line, as I have them connected to different phone lines, I'll
check that, but I doubt thats what it is.. I was wondering if someone can
tell me what the top of the line 56k modem is at the moment?  Thank you,
