Of course it can.. it all depends on what you are calculating.
Massively parellel computer systems lend themseves to programs which
can be broken up into distinct sections of code that are independent
of each other. This usually lent itself to modeling equations, and
that is all the programs can do. The programs also tended to be
hand-optimized for assembly at speed bottlenecks.

It would be like comparing say... an Indy Car to a Ford Escort. Indy
Car is great at doing 4 left turns on a 2.5 mile track, but Ford
Escort you can drive anywhere. And head to head on a street, with
traffic... the Indy Car not only loses its advantages, but runs out of
gas real fast :>.
