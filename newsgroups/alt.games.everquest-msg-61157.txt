Also, this is blasphemy here, pretty much, but you might want to give
Dark age of Camelot a go. I'm a dyed in the wool EQ player, but DAoC on
my sojourn there seemed easier, more polished and a little more "quakeesque".

The power differential at low levels wasnt as cruel as EQ; on the down side
it didnt seem anywhere near as sociable as EQ, or to contain the depth of
world and story that EQ does. On the up side the content that *was* there
was far far more accessible and pleasant to use, given their NPC interaction
system.

EQ has a LOT going for it if you have the patience, but there are other
choices out there now.

Oh, and if you stick with EQ... Qeynos is a nice backwater place to level
up; lots to kill, out of the way, not many high level or uberbeggar
geeks wandering through to spoil your immersion.

Freeport is a hectic metropolis, with all the detritus that comes with it.

Both places may be a little more to your liking than GFay... Qeynos has
the *magnificent* newbie dungeon of blackburrow too, of course, which 
can see you a fair way in, and is a good location to start to make friends
who play your times.
