Emmett the bard is still available, currently parked at level 31 IIRC.
I simply haven't bothered with Test for ages because of the problems
with time differences, but if the Monday (or Wednesday, whatever)
Night Fight gets up and running again, I'll be there - for a few
hours, at least.

I didn't want to continue leveling Emmett because of the grouping
problems that would lead to if we get started up again, plus I've
discovered I have some RL friends that play on Bristlebane, so that's
where my focus has been lately.  Currently I have 4 bards on the go -
two active ones at levels 23, and 30, and two parked at 29 and 31, all
intended for grouping with different people!  And yet because of the
times I play, I spend most of my time soloing.

Currently woodshedding with the following bards:
Banneth on Bristlebane
Ricken on Antonius Bayle
