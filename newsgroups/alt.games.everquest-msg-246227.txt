Except that physically walking the guy out takes several minutes. So 
your effective mission time is shorter. It takes me just as long to 
clear to an assasinate as a hostage... I can drop the boss in 30-40 
seconds.... the rescure is 5 minutes or more.

Sad part is every rescue that I've failed (usually when 3 or 4 manning 
an ldon) was failed *while* walking the hostage back. Those 5 more 
minutes made the difference.
