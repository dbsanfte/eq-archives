OK, this wouldn't be terrible at level 10.  But it doesn't scale up as 
we go, and doesn't get replaced till level 63.  At level 30, untwinked, 
I had just over 1000 hp (1004 to be precise).  3 hp per tic for a minute 
  is 30 hp, or a grand total of 3% extra healing, once every 5 minutes 
at best.  I still run it whenever bandaging up or when running around 
looking for my next mammoth... but its more a case of going thru the 
motions, rather than any real noticable effect.

Haven't bought this one yet.  Annoys me how disciplines are hidden in 
out of the way spots on vendors for other classes.  Although I hear this 
one is on a vendor in POK.

At any rate, I haven't heard a lot of people crowing about how useful 
this is; does increasing resists by an amount this small really mean much?

More importantly, will using it prevent me using not just the 
disciplines on this list, but (as War Cry line seems to) my far more 
important stun/snare/jolt abilities?  For 5 minutes?  Incredible.  Is 
there a way to click it off once its running?

I guess this one is useful on specific targets, fear is certainly quite 
annoying, and complete immunity is much better than a minor increase in 
resists.

This would be nice, I seem to miss as often as I hit, even getting a 
double attack and triple frenzy all missing at once point on a blue mob. 
  If my rough guess is correct this would double my damage output for 5 
ticks.

I dont crit much at the moment, but when I do its normally for about the 
same amount as my usual hits, or sometimes up to half again as much. 
Seems to me this will be less of an improvement than Inspired Anger. 
Still, assuming the endurance thing isn't a problem, I could chain them 
one after the other to give 10 tics of higher damage output.

Two tics?  Wow, that seems like a very short duration.  Still, should be 
long enough for a slow to land, and there are certainly mobs where its 
very hard to remain standing till they are slowed.  The autoriposte part 
will be sweet indeed given my tendancy to stick with big slow weapons.

This looks nice too, assuming my "50% misses" observation holds true 
till this level, this will mean going to a mere 25% misses, which 
will...double my damage output?  No, increase it by half.  But for a 
full minute, instead of the 5 tics of the earlier disciplines, and can 
chain with them, so now its 20 tics of increased damage output (again 
assuming endurance not a problem)

Hmm, seems like this, too, will roughly double damage output... perhaps 
more due to the minimum damage part.  Can someone tell me more about 
that part?

> Battle Focus - Level 59. Avoid every attack for 2 ticks. Recast of 40 mins.

Umm, this doesn't sound as good as autoriposting for two tics; the 
earlier discipline not only lets me not take damage but also makes me 
deal out ludicrous amounts assuming an unslowed quad hitting mob and a 
big assed molly hatchet in my hand.  Does increase "don't hit me" time 
to 4 tics, though, or doubles the number or times per hour I can do that 
for the two tics while hoping slow lands.

OK, this seems lame.  Blind rage is more than 3 times as good, PLUS 
increases minimum damage, AND has a shorter recast time to boot!

Oh come on, 3 tics?  How often is this going to come in handy?  I'm sure 
by this point I'll have Run 3, which makes me faster than almost all 
mobs almost all the time.  Only use I can think of would be when 
severely damaged to the point where I'm running so slow that Run 3 just 
doesn't cut it, and want to get away.  Can I make it to a zone line in 3 
tics in that situation?  Bah, I should just die if it comes down to that!

I've never been a melee at 63, don't really have a handle on what this 
will entail.  Seems situational, although I do get bashed a good deal at 
my level, which is annoying... but only when playing MT.  By 63 are 
berserkers really going to be MT a lot?

OK, assume 5k hp.  This is 1000 hp.  Thats 20%.  This is soo much more 
in scale with things than Focussed will.  If we got periodic upgrades 
thru our operating life that kept the will series at about 20% I 
wouldn't be complaining about it.  At level 62, Focussed Will is going 
to be good for 30 hp, then suddenly at 63 we get one thats good for 1000?

This is sad.  Damage output from crits has been estimated at 2.7%; a 
level 65 discipline that will take that to 5.4%?  Compared to the 
several disciplines above that either double (100%) or at least increase 
by half (50%) damage output for their duration?  What a JOKE!

No wonder berserks are so... berserk.  Whenever they start to lose the 
red rage, all they have to do is read over the description of their 
level 65 discipline!
