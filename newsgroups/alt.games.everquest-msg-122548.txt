Then you got really lucky with the "sneak" portion of "sneak/hide."

Rogues are the ONLY class, no matter which race or religion,
that can successfully Hide AND Sneak at the same time.  Any
other class, again, no matter which race or religion, will "break"
Hide the moment they move, even if successfully Sneaking.

Sneak works 100% of the time on any mob in the game, as
long as you're out of the front arc of the mob.  Dragons will
walk "over" your head if you're sneaking as long as you luck
out of their "viewing" arc.  You can follow Trakanon around in
his lair all day, if you stay under his belly and sneak.

As an aside, only rogues (reguardless of race/religion) will get
success/fail message on both Hide and Sneak.  EVERYBODY
WITH THE HIDE SKILL will "look like" they hid when using the
skill.  Without the success/fail message, the only way to know
you hid was to con a non-indifferent mob and see if it's now
indifferent to you.  If it is, Hide worked.  You'll disappear on your
own screen reguardless.
