More procs = good :)

Very nice.  Now mages can end the timeless Conj V. Evoc debate.

I don't use earth pets (and would hesitate to use Fire,even if it's DPS
was good) because of root.  WHy would I spend AA to handicap my BL pet?

Interested to see parses.

This and the mage version - Very appreciated.  We've asked for AA's to
enhance our pets for ages.

What's not to like :)

More ability to take punishment for the 'chanter is always good.

Very nice considering how we use MGB during fights now.

Hmmmm - so, group songs are now going to hit pets - but only if the bard
in question puts AA into it.  Putting the burden on the buffer is not going
to get group spells to hit pets - these AA's are going to be way down
on their list.

Rumor on the Tower is that the duration is incredibly short and the reuse
timer incredibly long - if that's true it'll be about useless.

Ooooh - higher int boost?  Wait, people at that level are already capped;
Hell - I'm capped, and would still cap with VoQ if I had 3 levels of IE.

The only one people care about - extra mana regen.  But only in dungeons,
as you can't use it with a horse.

Extra HP is nice, but again - ehhh

Resists are good - unuseable still where you can't lev.

Wrong desc on this I think - necro variant.

YAY! :)

Why don't wizards get a fire/magic based variants of Iceflame?  Also
I wonder if Spell/AA/Item foci stack - that'd be great for them, make them 
head and shoulders the best nukers.

Can't wait to see who gets this - I'd take it on either of my chars
in an instant

OOOH - gonna love our druidess even more :)

Again, should the burden be on the buffer?

I like these :)

Yet another AA with the wrong desc :-P

For classes that didn't get it in pop?

<sigh>  Wrong desc again - should be the necro variant of this.

!  Nice, more DPS is always good

Swarm pet without push?  VERY cool for necros.

Wizard?  Wonder how much damage, how is aggro attributed (and the
healing wards too).

Hmmm - interesting.  Possibly very nice to have for while waiting for 
TS to pop.

Again, with any luck a Wiz only aa.  With other casters getting 
the better FoM lines, they are losing ground in their forte.
