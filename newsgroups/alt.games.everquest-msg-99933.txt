I had this problem for a while.  It happened seemingly randomly in
several different zones.  I have not had it happen since I changed
my textures setting from high to medium.  I had also turned off
dynamic lighting at the same time, but have since turned dynamic
lighting back on (my human cleric alt needs light, heh) without
any recurrence of the problem.

If, as another poster speculated, the problem's root is a memory
usage bug, you might be able to reduce or eliminate it by reducing
memory usage thru the options (as I did by changing textures from
high to medium).  My first attempt to get rid of it was to turn
the texture caching off, but it seemed to make no difference on
or off.  These results are hardly conclusive, but are consistent
with the memory usage bug hypothesis.  Hope this helps, I quit
experimenting as soon as the problem stopped recurring.

I run with all the new models on.  My system has an Athlon XP 1600+,
512MB DDR, GeForce2 Ti, and a cheap generic soundcard.
