Everyone in the group needs to be within 7? levels of each other.  So, 
no, you could not take a single level 50 into a level 20 dungeon, as you 
could not get the adventure.  Well, OK, I take that back, start at level 
51 or 52, take xp deaths down to level 20ish, get three other level 20ish 
folks to group with you, get an adventure, get clicky rezzed back to 
level 50ish, zone in.  Since I don't know anyone who has tried this, I 
can't say if it will really work.
