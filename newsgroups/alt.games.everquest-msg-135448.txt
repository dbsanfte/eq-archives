Lesa "Never attacked you personally"

Lesa: "Looks like you had as much trouble with reading comprehension
on that front as you did with theWashington Post article."

Lesa:  "No, I don't belive it will teach tolerance while there are
adults like you in the world"

Lesa:  "warning, for some slow-witted individuals; heavy sarcasm
approaching"


There are plenty more examples of your personal attacks on me, but
what I have posted is sufficient to show that when you post that you
never attacked me personally, that post was a lie.

I had thought that it was just the subject matter that caused your
posts to be bitchy.  But, as it turns out, you seem to resort to lies
and personal attacks on any post where you have no logical argument.

Therefor I have no choice but to put you back in to the MKF..
Permanently this time.

And you call yourself a Star Trek fan... Shame on you... :^)

Have a happy... :^)
