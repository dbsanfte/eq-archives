This one more unconfirmed, though:

Rumors from the Safehouse  message boards are that as part of next
weeks changes, all hell levels (with the exception of 54 and 59) will
be removed from the game.

Since this is just rumor at the moment we can't provide any further
details on how Sony may address their previous reasons for not being
able to fix hell levels (i.e. it would cause all players who had
finished those levels already to gain massive experience).

Wonderful news if this goes through for new players and old players
wishing to make alts.
