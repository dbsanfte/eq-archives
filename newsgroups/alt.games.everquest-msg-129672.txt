Man, I disagree with this so intensely my brain is trying to crawl out of my 
nose and start typing all by itself...

First, I don't believe that (natural == good). In fact, I tend to believe 
the opposite, but then again, I've had it up to my ears of the "natural" 
argument, being a vegetarian (ooh... but people are natural omnivores, don't 
you know that?). Bah. I mean, what's the point of doing what's "natural"? We 
may as well be monkeys, if we were going to be "natural".

As for the "inevitable" part... well, yes so far, but that's what medical 
technology is for. I actually believe that mankind will not fulfill its 
potential until death becomes optional. When that happens, people will start 
taking responsibility for their actions, because they will know they *will* 
have to live with them. No more leaving the mess for our grandchildren. And 
stagnation? In fact, quite the opposite... Endless innovation, when people 
realize they have all the time in the world to learn new things, take up new 
jobs, develop potential artistic skills... Lack of time would never be an 
excuse again not to fulfill your capabilities.

If you reduced human lifespan by half, all you'd get is twice the number of 
generations making exactly the same mistakes all over again. The fact that 
man is the longest-lived mammal is no coincidence. Death sucks the big one, 
and what sucks most about it is having been born within just a few 
generations of mankind finally doing away with it.

/sigh
