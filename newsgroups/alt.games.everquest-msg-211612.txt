The problem with fizzles is that you are now stuck with the 3 second delay
that is set in the macro before you  can do anything. Once a macro starts
you have to let it finnish.  When ever you have an important spell on a
macro you should have it cast 3 times.  You can take out the closing pause
if you get rid of the /sit /stand, which if you arn't going to be paying
attention to the cleric would be a good idea. Sit agro will get him waised
in no time, especialy if you have him sitting just after the spell lands.

Since these are important macros, Aren't all heals important. i would build
in a 1/10th second buffer for lag into the macro. I used to say to do a .2
or .3 , but lately there hasn't been any major constant lag even in our 60+
member raids.

I would set it up like this.

/pause 1, /target <party member>
/pause 6, /cast 2
/pause 6, /cast 2
/pause 6, /cast 2
/g incoming heal for %t, unless I got 3 fizzles.

Fizzle delay is always 1/2 second + lag gives you a delay of 6.  If you have
more than 3 fizzles ( yes it happens, 12 in a row here once on a spell that
was 5 levels old) you can just hit the macro again.  The extra attempts at
casting won't do anything, just give you the you cant do that message.

Hope this helped.
