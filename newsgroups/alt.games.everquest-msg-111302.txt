LOL I was waiting for that line. There is nothing unreliable about my
connection it has been a couple of weeks since I last saw a "you have been
disconnected" message. I have never suffered one during a trade but others
who I have been dealing with have had this happen (not to mention countless
of shouts whining that it has happened to them) I do not consider the risk
"great" I just don't see a need to put my items at risk needlessly, if you
have the 8k to by my Axe then I'd expect you know what it's stats are, if
you want to see it first then I doubt you have the funds. When I paid 15k
(my most expensive purchase to date) for my breeches I only needed to check
them once and that was just before I hit trade. If someone has an item I
want at a price I consider reasonable then I buy it, I don't ask for stats,
I know them or else I wouldn't want the item in the first place.
If you are just shopping for bargains to sell on then I don't care for your
trade anyway, I'd rather sell them cheap to someone that wants them for what
they are than to someone to make money from them.
If I lose "potential" customers for my "paranoia" good, they can go waste
someone elses time and leave me to sell to real buyers.
