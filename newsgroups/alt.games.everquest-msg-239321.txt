There are a very few weapons, including summoned Cleric Hammers
that have non-standard proc rates.  For the rest...

At a 305 DEX most main-hand weapon procs fire an average of 2.05
times per minute.  Weapon delay, including weapon delay modifiers,
does not affect the frequency of procs over time (i.e. the faster
you swing the less the chance of a proc on that particular attack).
Likewise, double  and triple attack do not affect proc frequency
(you get one chance to proc per weapon per delay cycle, regardless
of the number of swings you get on any particular attack).  Procs
from off-hand attacks are half as frequent.  The Weapon Affinity
AA from GoD increases proc frequency by 10 to 50% (10% / level of
the AA).

It appears from parsing that procs are checked in the order: weapon
then augment then combat innate, and if one fires the others are
not checked, but the per swing chance of a proc is not compensated
for this effect.  This means that augment procs occur at a slightly
lower frequency if the weapon has a built-in proc, and combat innate
proc frequency is lowered by the presence of either or both of the
other proc types.

I've seen it claimed that off-hand procs can fire whether you get an
actual swing or not, dunno if that's true.  What the highend players
do report consistently from their parsing is that off-hand procs occur
half as often as main-hand procs.

Oh, and it's not useful to think in terms of proc "timers".  While it
is, of course, possible to create a "timer" based system that would
produce the observed results with roughly 4327 times as much code as
the multiply plus three consecutive tests vs. RNG values that are
actually required, it would take several programming pairs, each of
which consisted of a half-trained genius and a retarded tapeworm,
working at cross-purposes and with no direct communication permitted
over a period of approximately 17 years to accomplish such a wondrous
feat.  And while SOE does have an elite dev team "fire-brigade" that
meets those qualifications, everybody knows that they've been far too
busy with important tasks like fixing Alchemy, creating and coping
with the Bard song code, and the first 19356 versions of the Bazaar
code to spare such a substantial effort for any side projects.
