I also had a darkwood staff or something that was basically all

BST or something as a class now too.

Ahahah wow, new faction.
Yeah I've never heard of Primordial malice.

I really doubt it. They are like the ogres in that no quest you can do
from a non kos point raises all the factions so really no one but
those who start non kos can ever be fully non kos. There are some good
races which are the same way, such as the Halvlings in Rivervale. No
quest raises that cleric one so no matter how many halfling pluses you
get in the wild, those people outside the cleric guild (and near one
exit) are going to kill you in passing by. For the most part you can't
even raise that faction from its base point as a GOOD race so evils
are really SOL. No, before you say, the halfling guise for a dark elf
won't work because its your god Innoruuk they really won't like (don't
know if a DEF enchanter who is agnostic can start the quest or not to
raise that faction)

One way they further make that hard in BOTH grobb and Ogguk is actual
competing factions in the city itself even IF you are a native. For
example the ogre warriors are somewhat in competition with the ogre
sks, and your faction will show that. The troll sks are also in
competition witht he troll warriors and you even will start out glower
dubious I think. In both of those cases many quests or kills you can
get to raise one, also lowers the other though usually not to the
point where you'd be KOS.. it would just be a pretty impossible chore
as the same race though to get both high in some cases.
