They sure do.  I've found myself encumbered many times, only to open my
inventory and have a ton of copper.  I destroy it or drop it and free up
quite a few pounds.

From my observations, copper weighs the most, then silver, on up. If you are
at a level that you are hesitant to drop copper or silver on the ground, run
to the closest bank and leave it there, or exchange it for higher value
(less weighty) coins.
