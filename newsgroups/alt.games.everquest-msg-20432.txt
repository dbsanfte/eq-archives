The DE reaver is a triggered spawn from a druid or ranger on their epic
quest. Since the quest do NOT involve killing him, just running away, he
will roam the area for a while after the druid are gone.
When i did that part all in zone 4 hours before it got a warning, got a
warning again at 8 AM, another warning just before i triggered spawn, 2
warnings while i ran away, and a warning when i zoned.
So think noone got hurt when i did it, but you never know, someone might
just walk in. Sometime you just get unlucky, and NOTHING can stop you from
dying
Camped Gynok for around 10 hours in Befallen, 2 sec after he pop a level 11
rogue enter, she died before i finished casting the first spell. Sometime
shit just happens.
