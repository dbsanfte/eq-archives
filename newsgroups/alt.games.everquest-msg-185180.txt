Having had some advice from folkses in here, I suggested my autobuild group
(bunch of friends who have a habit of appearing in nex at the same time I do
some nights) that we go and whack some things in the burning wood. Our group
consisted of:

53 pally with his new heavenly heal over time bolt from the sky type spell.
He also has the two tined corpse pitchfork which I constantly drool over.
(would like to see what that thing does with 200 dex, 100% haste and soul
abrasion 3)
51 sk (meeeeee)
40 wizzy
39 ranger

Uber group? No! But we haven't been as strong since our cleric quit, and
those two little guys really need to pull their socks up. Or quit their jobs
or dump their wives or something. Actually everybody has a job but us single
guys are kicking more ass hrm

Anyway, everybody bar the ranger got c3 and after a few standard pulls the
wizzy went LD and didnt come back. Losing your C3 nuker, even if he can only
chain nuke for 380 or whatever is a bit of a blow we noticed. Pally was
healing a lot so after our first med break ( :p ) I was about to suggest we
start fear kiting when this dark blue named gorilla crawls up the hill next
to us. If I remember his name ill fill it in... Gullerback thats it.

Anyway, I was down to half mana but our hp were going strong. We medded up a
fraction longer and I decided that an attempted fear kite was in order. I
move into range, cast dooming darkness and yup you guessed it... resist :)

"Woot, this is going to be interesting" I thought, moved back, and recast.
Resist. Sent pet.

Pally grabs agro and begins stun/tanking. I recast. Resist.

I rush in and start whacking away, having given up on the snare I cast fear
(my only vague reasoning for this was to test if we had any vague chance of
viably fear kiting the bastard) resist.

I throw in my nukes... he eats them but 390hp doesn't mean much to this guy.
I switch to debuffs (gotta spend that mana on something right?), take down
his strength and armour class. Sure spent the mana anyway. Battle ensues.
Pally drops to a fraction of a bubble, uses LOH and continues to tank. We
get him down a fair way, swapping agro between me and the pally a little to
give him a chance to heal himself... my hitpoints go down to half and stay
there.

The final stage of the battle begins - gullerback has one bubble left but so
does the pally and I'm down to about 2. We're not going to make it like this
but I only have enough mana for either a feign death or an agro spell. I can
tank and die or live and let him eat my friends. <clicks agro spell>

And he reflected, both at the time and forever after, that he could not
decently have done anything else...

Gullerback begins taking kuloth to pieces, while the pally throws a quick
heal or two on himself and begins trying to regain agro. I drop to a bubble,
half a bubble, a fraction of a bubble - click feign death... insufficient
mana... back away a little, pally still hasnt gained agro.... feign
death..... nope... you go one better and pull the real thing.

The nexus sure is cold this time of year. W00t! we won! <elevator music> Inc
rez! Post-rez I've only lost what I gained since I came to burning wood 40
mins ago... I don't mind cos I've learned an important lesson about named
mobs and resists ;)

I loot my corpse, and realise, with a shudder, that my c3 is gone unless I
walk or get a port up to nex to renew it. Mindful of accusations people have
thrown at me regarding inability to group without it, I decide against
making the effort, just to see what it's like. We begin to fear kite and I
quickly realise that nuking isn't worth the extra med time. We tried tanking
to cut down my med time but it didn't really work - ate the pally's mana
faster than a starving drolvarg - and didn't really cut my med time. When
the battle ended I still had x amount of ticks at 19 mana/tick to regen
enough back to kite again.

To cut a long story short, kiting wurms was a load of fun but took up half
my mana pool per fight - ouchy :) Other things weren't as tough, but my
basic gist is I was able to fear kite for a group with no C3... it just
meant med breaks that lasted longer than each fight. Slowest exp I've had in
a long time, although I think the ranger was having a ball since we were
whacking mostly red cons hehe.

Anyway, will no doubt mention BW in many of my future "Rants". Thoughts so
far: plenty of potential for soloing, probably groups at my level are
overkillish, haven't tried the giant fort yet :)

Regards,
James
