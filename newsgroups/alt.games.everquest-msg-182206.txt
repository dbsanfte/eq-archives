Nope. Dot = a Damage Over Time spell. One that causes constant damage,
instead of one that just does damage once. Kite = Either slow down or root a
mob or use SoW on yourself to keep it from closing in on you while you
attack. (Or Fear Kite, which sort of explains itself: Fear the mob then
attack it while its fleeing) Snare is a spell that makes a mob move slower,
instead of stopping it from moving like Root does.

So basically, they hit the mob with a Snare (or other spell that slows a mob
down), threw a Damage Over Time spell on it, then Nuked it with direct
damage spells. (The character in your example sounds like a Druid or a
Ranger high lvl enough to cast those types of spells)
