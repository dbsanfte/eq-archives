There is a difference between needed and non needed, and useful and not 
useful.

Clerics are often useful.  They are rarely needed.  This is true of most 
classes, exceptions are rare indeed.

Once upon a time, there was a "holy trinity" in the game, and few groups 
would even consider making a move without a cleric, enchanter, and 
warrior.  This meant at most three slots for the other 12 or so classes 
to compete for.  That time is long past, for most content, even when its 
serious work, a trinity of any healer, any tank, any CC will serve, and 
the need for some real DPS instead of that supplied by mere tanks means 
that the other classes aren't so much "also ran".

Note that even then, for most content, this setup wasn't the only 
possible approach, but it was the one that 90% of the people on the 
servers seemed to think necessary; you could sit a druid LFG for hours 
while watching groups sit around /ooc group of five needs cleric at your 
level range.

When people see someone suggesting, as you have, that clerics are the 
lynchpin to a successful group, I think it does a couple things;  one, 
it triggers a flashback to those bad old days, and at the same time, 
contradicts what people have repeatedly experienced in more recent 
gaming; we all know that there are lots of alternatives to a cleric, in 
fact that perfectly viable groups can be built with no nominal "healer" 
class at all... we know it because we've done it, and the only people 
that haven't are those who play clerics or partner with one exclusively.

As an aside, "Even the makers of the game" isn't a good approach to 
take, since SOE, and Verant before them, have a long track record of 
explaining class roles and abilities in ways that are entirely wrong.
