I have played EQ on Win 98 and Win ME so far, and i never noticed any 
problems with my c:\temp dir. I ALWAYS have that dir (am used to it, so 
when i reformat, i make the dir, no matter if i have something in it or 
not). And EQ never deleted anything from it, or deleted the dir, no 
matter if it was empty or not.
