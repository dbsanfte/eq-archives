Oh really?  The only way?  How about this way?

Leave the account, but subtract the amount of the refund from it.
E.g., if someone is paid up 3 months in advance and gets a refund for
that 3 months ($30) and for Luclin ($30), set their account at -$30.
If they later reactivate, they will have to pay back the $30 Luclin
refund to get back to 0 and be allowed to play.
