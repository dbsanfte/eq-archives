Twink means that you have much better armour then others of the same level.
So you need to tranfser money/items from your existing character to you're
new one. This can be done by a friend who transfers the equipment to your
new character,or indeed a second account.

There are also e-bay player who bought money/items on e-bay for real money
but that people are just sick, its cheating in my opinion and I don't give
real money to buy some everquest items, its just a game and some people
forget that.
