Doesn't actually mean the DoN tank can't do it though... but I see 
you're going there yourself...

That was my leaning as well. :)

That dove-tails with what I said in my rambling last post, where I 
commented about the perception of adequacy. Like you I suspect that *if* 
they actually let a DoN geared knight tank in RSS and the group was 
actually paying attention they'd probably do just fine, get some drops, 
get decent xp, and yes even perhaps wipe now and then. But overall it 
would be 'effective'.

Sadly, this sort of attitude/behaviour while common of uberguilders is 
also common in general in support classes, even totally gimped ones. 
After all, in most one-group content, like most old raid content, you 
just need adequate healing and a good main tank. The rest of the raid 
can be made up of half wits in cloth armour. As long as they don't pull 
aggro and they stay at the back it hardly matters if they're even at the 
keyboard, nevermind what they are equipped with. 

This results in bards, monks, rogues, & casters who all cherry pick 
tanks with the same criteria as the 'whining uberguilders', while 
turning away players who are at their own gear level, or even well 
beyond it.

Its bad enough being turned away by a group of uberguild snobs who 
aren't willing to have to actually adapt or pay attention while they do 
one group content, and <gasp> risk the odd death... its far worse to be 
turned away by a group of gimps who think its ok for them to have gear 
they found lying in a friends alts bank or soloed by kiting in some 
outdoor velious/luclin zone, yet absolutely insist upon OoW raid gear on 
the people they group with. 

(Although I have heard some horror stories by enchanters who can't get 
into groups because they don't have the CC spells the group insists they 
have, and of course they can only get those spells being in the very 
groups that are excluding them...so its not solely a problem for tanks.)

But that's life. I don't think there is a real fix for that except for 
the 1-group geared tank to make friends, and find good regular groups.

We just need more 1-group content that behaves like modern raid content, 
demanding a little more from everyone present than that they just be 
present. Of course, this will doom the weaker players and worse everyone 
who groups with them...
