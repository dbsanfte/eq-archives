Despite people hollering and screaming differently, critters really don't
get THAT much mana.  Usually my casting 3 Mana Sieves (about 370 each, for
me) is enough to drain pretty much everything I cast it on (special
encounters not included).

Granted, that's 10 casts for you but my mana stealer doesn't do a 6 second
stun like Thunder does.

I don't see Every Day use for it, but it looks like a fairly ok spell.
