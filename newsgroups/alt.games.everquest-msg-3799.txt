I'am sorry if  I make the impression I'am comparing another titles with your
beloved game, all I want to say is that the monthly online service fee as
far as I know, is not yet a consideration on both systems. I'am actually
thinking about the Sega's Phantasy Star Online(RPG) and Square's Final
Fantasy XI(although the game is not on the market yet, but from I heard it
from interviews and magazines the game will just like Phantasy Star Online,
that means no monthly fee)

In fact I personally don't think it is a bad idea to download from the
internet if you've cable/DSL modem(distributed through those download
servers all over the world), computer game magazines, local computer shops,
newsagent ..etc. Maybe I should say I hope Sony not to charge me for the
software itself, but the account and all those necessary overheads. I got
EverQuest in Hong Kong as a value set which included the EverQuest: The
Ruins of Kunark+The Scars of Velious at a cost of US 44 dollars(I was
persuaded by shop assistant), if I bought both boxes separately I actually
require to pay US 54 dollars. Let alone I've to pay for the monthly service
fees(I actually choose the default 3 months option after the one month free
trial which will cost slightly less). If I do spend 15 to 20 hours a month
for the game I probably will say it is worthy.

I think I shouldn't say something like that even I don't like  some of terms
from the user agreement and software license. If you can make a laugh out of
it, it is not too bad afterall. I think it is not very scientific to regard
it as 35 cents a day. What really matter I think is the time you spend on
playing the game, I just don't enjoy the game as much as you, I probably
like a more fast pace console games. Although I've learned from TV that
there're banks do issue credit card for online shopping here in Hong Kong(to
encourage more people using transaction or shopping online), which means a
very low credit limit(less than US1200), unfortunely the one I got is not
one of those cards. I do feel annoy that the bank give too large the credit
limit, even they feel you're a good customer they should realize whether you
will spend that much money using credit card. I actually call the card
center to help me out, although they didn't lower my limit, it promises to
take care my concern for that transaction with Sony. I personally like the
way Amazon.com protecting customers information, if Sony take the same
approach I won't have the complaint.
