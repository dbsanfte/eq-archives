Really not trying to join in this debate here, just curious from a factual standpoint:

Assuming the majority of customers are in the continental US, and therefore Sony wants to patch during
the early morning in that part of the world so that they inconvenience the lowest possible number of
people, wouldn't it make more sense for longer patches to start somewhat earlier than that? A four hour
patch that starts from 3 am to 6am (depending on time zone) would end from 7 am to 10 am, which isn't
too bad. But get much longer than that and you risk cutting into some major daytime playing hours.
Granted, at 3am some people still haven't quit playing for the night, but I would guess that more
people in a given time zone play at noon than at 3am. Anyone know if they ever roll back the start time
for the long patches?


*Disclaimer* I'm only asking a question, here. In no way should any of this be considered an expressed
opinion on the current state of patching, time zones, the idea of sharing the burden of lost playtime,
who is/is not a clueless moron, religion, politics, etc. Thank you.
