	The raids I've fought RC on were public.  The chance of disaster in a
public raid increases in direct proportion to the number of people moved over
any distance of hostile terrain.  (Among numerous other factors, of course.
:-)

	Unfortunately that's largely true of my guild as well; as a member
recently said, we turn into the Keystone Kops any time we try to get more than
12 people someplace.  We can probably handle RC with nominal attendance, but
we'll pull him to zone if we try. :-)
