Usenet spam is generally calculated using Breidhart's Index.

It takes into account the number of times something's been posted and the
number of groups it's crossposted into.  If the value goes over 20...it's
spam. 

What I don't understand is why this problem was posted into 
rec.games.video.sony, which is mainly about the Playstation - not Everquest.
