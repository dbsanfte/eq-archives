Is it possible to get faction up to indifferent or better with runnyeye?
Been killing named evil eyes for a few days and while the pbbs are nice, its
boring since I get no xp's.  They still scowl.  I don't think I ever killed
any runnyeye except I don't remember if the picklaws gave runnyeye faction
hits when I was there so long ago.
