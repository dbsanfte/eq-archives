i wasnt begging really..

just taking a chance by asking some higher-ups if they want to give me
anything :)
i know i always have some old stuff that i could give away. some of the
banded armor i have i almost consider junk. but to a level 1-10, it should
be a nice thing to have - if everyone didnt seem to already be a twink. if
there is a level 50-60 Ranger who is dressed in full Plane - plate, their
Ivy Etched might be junk to them now.

i dont "need" anything though... im sure i could get to 60 one day with the
same stuff i've had the past 20-40 levels.

i was able to get a Bracer by myself. the shadownight-orc in Everfrost was
light blue at 40 but still hurt me bad. with the other bracer and the tunic,
a level 50-ish wizard helped me get them.

anyway, if you have anything a 40+ ranger could use, i play as "Dondie" on
Xegony.
