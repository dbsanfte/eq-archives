"IP" is completely irrelevant to the entire concept of item/character sales. 
If I have a Sword of Intellectual Properties, and I sell it for real world
cash to someone else, it is *still* a Sword of Intellectual Properties,
*still* on Sony's servers, and any "IP" claim to be made was not put at
risk whatsoever.

Sony must argue exactly that, by the way, or be faced with the
counter-argument of "dillution" for everytime someone clicks the destroy
button.  =P
