#1: do the Stein of Mogguk quest to get, err, a Stein of Mogguk :)
#2: while in Ogguk for #1, see if you can get a Crude Stein by either a)
looting one off a dead Bouncer if anyone is killing them, or b) checking
the merchants to see if anyone has sold one to a merchant. If you can't
get one either way, try to buy one in your server's auction zone.

After that, some other things you could get would be:

- silk evening tunic from Qeynos, +5 cha.
- silver rose quartz rings, +2 int each. very cheap to buy, or make with
a low jewelcraft skill
- silver jaded bracers, cheap to buy, or make with low jewelcraft skill.
If you can afford it, the golden ones will be better for you.

After those things, don't worry about it much until you are in your mid
20's. At that point, try to get:

- polished bone bracers from Beholder's gorge
- golden cat's eye agate bracers
- if you have a good group, you could start your quest for the
Incandescant Gloves.
- silver star ruby veil (if you can afford it)
- flowing black robe from Najena

At 30+, try to start working on getting:

- drake hide leggings from Solusek's Eye
- gatorscale sleeves from Upper Guk
- runed circlet from Permafrost (you could probably do this mid to late
20's with a good group)
- braided cinch cord
- incandescant mask
- save up to buy, or make if jewelcrafting, electrum star ruby rings if
you want more cha, golden sapphire earrings

These are just the basics, there's obviously plenty of other things you
could get. For a non-twink, though, I think most of this should be
doable. I'm going by my enchanter's progression, roughly, as mine was
also not twinked. I wore the silk evening tunic until 28; people always
thought I was on a corpse recovery, heh. But it doesn't matter what
equipment you have, as long as you play your class intelligently. You'll
get a nice +cha buff at 20 or 24, I think, so that will help as well.

Good luck and hope that helps.
