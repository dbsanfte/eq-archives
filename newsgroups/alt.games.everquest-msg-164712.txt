This brought back some memories for me.  What was everyone's very first
computer game.

If I go with mac it was Lemonade Stand, if I go with PC it was Kings Quest.
Loved KQ, and actually jumped on Sierra's The Realm becaue of the KQ game.
Unfotunately The Realm is pretty much obsolete, but nekkid Fufu fighting
sure was fun.
