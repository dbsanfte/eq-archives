I'm looking forward to our guod being able to do the higher level
quests - we've recently got access to our first guild raid, so that

Thanks for posting your adventures - gives us slow levellers something
to look forward to.    :)

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
