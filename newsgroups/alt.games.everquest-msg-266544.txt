Well, a quick google of the subject says that, out of 60-80 million
cases of food poisoning a year, 6-8 million people die of it. Another
articles says that 9000 deaths per year in the US are attributable
to food poisoning.

Sounds like waaaaaaayyyy too much of a risk to use to trap a TV
dinner thief.
