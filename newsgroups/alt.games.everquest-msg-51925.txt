And this my friends is the basis around wholesale - retail market. Typically
the wholesaler can get mass quantities of the product so he sells low and
usually in mass quantities. His profit margin will usually be higher than
yours for the same time period as it does not take him as long to gather and
sell as it does for you to buy low and sell high. A smart consumer will look
for these wholesalers and put them in their friends list for future buys.
But if in a hurry and not much time people will pay a bit more to a
retailer. In your story the seller spent the time productive leveling up and
got a HQ bear skin in one fight soon as he got it sold it and went right
back at it and he made 25pp. You sold it and made 18pp yet it took you a
little longer to sell it looking for the right buyer. During this time you
were not getting XP like he was. Now he could have saved then till he was so
encumbered as to maybe get killed and try and look for a retail consumer but
it was not worth it to him for all the down time that he could be getting
more HQ pelts and XP.
