I love KEI, but I don't seek it out (I do however instantly shout "YES!"
when an enchanter shouts for a port in exchange for KEI).

My EJ gorilla epic camp I refuse to work without it though, too damned many
adds for my normal mana.  I just end up running around, getting all 3 PH's
and whatever else attacks me into a pseudo-quad and kill them.  Total
score - too many pseudo-quads to count (at least 12)  - 1 fake tainted.
BAH.  I'd be happy right now with a VSR stone, then I could get my
half-epic.
