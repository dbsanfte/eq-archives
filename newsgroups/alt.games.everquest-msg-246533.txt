Horrible skills by use designer who ruined ultima Online, turning it
into a little macrofest game.

".. are predicting will be the first million-subscriber online game. "

AHAHHA... AHAHAHAH

I don't know why they continue to pay the guy. Whatever he touches
turns to suck. He took the SWG universe and made it into yet another
game with virtually nothing initially to kill and nothing to do but
make a few things and own a house.

I saw his name attached to SWG and stayed the hell away, after logging
into the beta for about 45 minutes and seeing how horrible it was.
