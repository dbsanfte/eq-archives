During a Guild Raid on Dalnir on Morell Thule 2 groups of 30-40's, with 50+
Druid and Enchanter in support, fought on level 2 for 3 hours or so. At the
end we all headed for the Big Boss at the bottom. We cleared right through
to the end room, when the previous room respawned and we got overrun, (spent
too long getting pictures on the big table :)). Our Cleric Gated, and I got
to the TP with 1 bub HP left. I was then able to sing invis and get all the
way back down without being seen once with the Cleric. I then had to do it
again when he cast Gate instead of revive (bah - stupid High Elves).

I'd recommend Dalnir Raids to any guilds for monk items - they go crazy down
there :)
