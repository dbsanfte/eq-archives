OK, so I've done Ixxy a fair number of times - maybe 8 or 9 by now. I could
swear in those times (last one a few months ago), that his AoE was
directional and point blank. In reading Illya's however, I'm seeing a
targeted AoE instead and a 30' range.

Can anyone verify that one for me? It does seem explainable since we always
turn him away from the raid force and only have the MT in front of him, it
would give the same effect of directional (given the relatively short range
of the AoE).

Also, I don't recall ever taking damage from the AoE but perhaps once - yet
it says it's unresistable. I'm wondering whether I've just had my facts off
(which has been known to happen), or if perhaps he was changed when they
changed the cleric epic around a year or more ago.

TIA,

Sing
