Sorry about the new topic, but I figure this has strayed far enough from 
the original topic to warrant a new one.

This could be an interesting test of this theory:
Have someone chain stun a mob (say a pally), and have warrior mash taunt.  
Now, the stuns should certainly out-aggro the warrior's taunt (as 
demonstrated by the paladin's ability to grab aggro quickly in PoP groups).  
But as soon as the taunt succeeds, the mob should start beating on the 
warrior instead of the pally.  The warrior should not be hitting the mob at 
all to rule out any external aggro generation that might otherwise out-
aggro the paladin.

My feeling is that taunt adds a certain ammount to the hate list, and 
warriors just have to taunt multiple times to get back on top of the list.

Has anything like this been done before?  Any volunteers?
