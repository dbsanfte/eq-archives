Yes, it is.  That you deny it is, well, mind boggling.

Otherwise I'll go make a new Monk and name him Yuck Foo.  Or how about my new
necro named Fother Mucker?  Perfectly acceptable if we follow your illogic.

Luckily, Verant can do whatever the hell they want whether or not it's
specifically listed in the rules (since it is, after all, their game).  I
would petition Tigole Bitties on principle (just changing the last name would
be fine, Tigole is a cool name on its own).  It's clearly someone trying to
get around the rules that have been laid out, and they should be called on it.
I'd like to think that there's still a small sense of Norrath being a world
instead of a big pretty chatroom.
