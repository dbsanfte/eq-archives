Every character of mine who has it has a dedicated slot to it (unless
I'm fighting exclusively root resistant mobs).  I can't imagine anything
more useful.  The mana can be a bit of a problem once in awhile for my
enchanter though.

There's some very good reasons.  As a 54 enchanter mem blur works
occasionally at best (maybe 1/3 of the time, or perhaps more like after
3 castings).  You don't know when it worked.  If you have to cast it
more than once you are right back where you were with taunting, only you
are using mana & medding time for it.  I've found that more often than
not if you cast it after a taunt it gets rid of the taunt, but seems to
leave you higher up on the hate list.  It takes some time to refresh,
much longer than root.  You have to dedicate a slot to it if you are
going to do that too, and I'm sure not going to give up something else
for a crappy, maybe working spell that you can't immediately recast.  

Basicly after a certain lv, probably somewhere around 35 mem blur
becomes extremely limited, but still a utility spell in certain rare
situations, or good for pling people (poorly in my experience).

Justi - 54 Enchanter - Call me a "Chanter" and I might just dispell that
mob you snared and dotted, but crack dealer is fine by me.
