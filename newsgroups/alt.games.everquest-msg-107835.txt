If you make a 

/g %t is my pet!  Give him a bisquit, not a blasting, please!

hotkey, your group will soon get the point.  If your group has so much 
battlespam that they don't see pet calls, then they're probably not seeing 
assist calls, please heal calls, or mez calls either.  Seriously, it's 
just like any other battlecall.  Groups that can't communicate are doomed 
to failure.

You might want to check that.  The mob will continue to cast on your party 
members, but they should be getting 'a_mob cast ubernuke_01 on you, but 
you are protected' messages.  I confirmed as recently as last night that 
if I charm the mob I get the message, and as recently as last week with 
another bard.
