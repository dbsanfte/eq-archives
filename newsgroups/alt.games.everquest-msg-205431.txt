There's a way to guarantee a win from a casino:  progressive betting:

For example, bet 100pp.  If you win, you get paid 200pp after having paid
out 100pp.

If you lose, bet 200pp.  If you win, you get paid 400pp after having paid
out 300pp.

If you lose, bet 400pp.  If you win, you get paid 800pp after having paid
out 700pp.

If you lose, bet 800pp... you get the idea.  Eventually you will win a bet
and win 100pp.

This is why Vegas allows for a narrow range of betting - minimum $50,
maximum $500, or something like that.  To prevent progressive betting.  You
may run into EQ casino operators who are not aware of this; take advantage
of them while you can!

Or do what I do: ignore casino operators as being mildly less interesting
than leeches, and don't give them any of your money under any circumstances.
