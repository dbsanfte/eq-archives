Would also be nice to have some kind of limited scripting support for
chatting... so that in my INI I could have:
PUBLIC:ALL::Druids Suck:/say Hey, %name ... can you back that up?;/duel
%name
TELL:GUILD:IN:Hello:r Hey, %name what's up?
TELL:GUILD:IN:SoW me:r Ok %name, I'll SoW you;/target %name;/spell 2
PUBLIC:ALL:IN:SoW me:/say I never bought SoW.. it's been replaced by my
Cloth Sandles of Super Fastness +50


Obviously, if a guild mate asks for sow, it would hit the line where I reply
OK and sow them by targeting them, casting SOW.  OF course they'd have to be
close enough.
If some n00b just waltzes up and asks for SoW I'd reply that I like my
shoes.
If a guildmate IN my zone says hello, I respond.
Anyone says druids suck near me, I respond and challenge the %name who said
it!
Etc.,  GAWD would this rock.
I know it's been requested before... but the more we bitch about it the
better our chances...
