Not having played an SK I can't help with your other questions, but I
can with this one. Everybody who's engaged the mob in some fashion has a
place on it's "hate list". The creature is going to attack whoever is on
top of that list in most any case. If you are the MA Tank (and as an SK,
let's hope it's not often) Then right in the beginning of the battle
you're going to want to be keeping that taunt button mashed and swinging
as fast as possible to get way up on the hate list. That's because if
the rogue suddenly pops in with some huge-ass backstab, or the wizard
drops the old wrath of god nuke on it, that will suddenly drop a huge
amount of hate on them and if they make the top of the list, the mob
will turn on them so you want to be as high as possible. For longer,
drawn out fights, I've laid off hitting the taunt button for a few
seconds if it looks like a wizard or rogue is getting ready to fire. I
can't confirm this, but it has seemed like, when a mob turns on a
caster, if I have taunt primed and ready, one hit of it can sometimes
turn the mob back to me. I dont' know if that's because I was only
*barely* off the top of the hate list, or if the renewed taunt was a big
spike in hate, but that's my perception of it. When you are *not* the MA
Tank, of course, you'll want to leave the button alone. Keep it mashed
constantly when soloing, get in that habit, and keep it so that you'll
always have the skill maxed out.
 Oh, and for forty levels, I tied sense heading into my taunt hotkey.
Maxed that out every level fast too and didn't have to even think about
it.
