But why why why must they do all the servers at once?

"fix" one, see if it works, move on the the next.  If it takes 8 hours
to do what, 30 servers?  Then surely it really only takes 20 minutes
to do one.  Put that one on line and let the -real- testers, the
players, get in and beat it up for a while; there's a 50% chance
that its going to need a second short patch in an hour or so.  SInce
at the end of that hour you are looking at only 33% of the servers
with the patch completed, you eliminate the need for a second
repair for the remaining 66%.

Save down time on all players (no sever down for more
than 30 minutes, most only for 20) and save labor time
(66% of machines don't need the secondary patch process)

Roll arndom selection as to which servers get hit when.

Also, encourage people to have secondary characters on a
number of servers, so they can tinker around a little if they
want for the relatively brief time thier main server is
down.  In particular, I'm thinking of the PvP servers,
patch day would be a fun time to go play hunt the wabbit...
or to -be- the wabbit!
