    It's almost as bad to set this up as it is for a ranger to set up their
ATK buffs. Apparently they have to go through some silly ritual of casting
to finally get the right buff/buffs on them, and then usually get the whole
shebang wiped out when someone casts Brell's on their group.

> Which of the three conflict with the cleric and mage self only buffs?

    PotG - the mana regen components don't stack. http://lucy.fnord.net is a
GREAT database - it shows everything in the spdat file, and what it
conflicts with and why. We use it to plan out how to block various mob
AoE's - the AoE will be in the spdat, so we can see what it might overwrite
or not be able to overwrite. It's also fun to see the fake stuff that's been
put in there to play with folks that parse the spdat.

    PotG and the cleric AC buff line (like Bulwark of Faith) stack because
the parts that give AC in these spells take up different "slots" in the
spdat. Aegolism, being a combination of BoF and Marzin and Heroism, uses
slot 2 (Increase Max HPs by 1100), slot 3 (Increase HPs by 1100 when buff
lands), and slot 4 (Increase AC by 54). Heroism, in contrast, uses slot one
(Increase AC by 18), and slots two and three for the HP effects. PotG is the
same as Heroism, with the added mana regen component in slot four. If two
spells have the same effect in the same slot, they don't stack. The effect
we were facing is Sermon of Ssraeshza, which is an AC change in slot four -
it'll conflict with Aegolism, but not PotG which has mana regen there.
There's also some problems with two other effects in the area which blow out
PotG and Koadic's Endless Intellect, but we were able to get those
controlled.

    If it didn't have the mana regen component I'm sure you'd already have a
version, possibly even lower level. It's something for druids to ask for in
caster balancing.
