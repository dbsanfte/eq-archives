 ST takes 2 hours. 3 at most. I wouldn't classify it as a 'pain' to
clear, especially since there are lots of times when ST is the only
thing up. The disappointing part about post-awakening excursions is that
you only really get to kill three things. Everytime I'm there it just
feels like a wasted zone.

 For the price of a ST key and a very rare scale I'd say yeah, they are
just OK. Not worth it in my opinion. Ring of Superiority and Earring of
the Icecaster (Jorlleag) are fairly comparable. Not as good, true, but
more in line with what it takes to get them.

 Sont sometimes drops a peerless BP. Or matchless. Whatever the better
one is. Not overly great but it's something, anyway. Good gimp gear.
