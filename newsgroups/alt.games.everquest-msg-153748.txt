You're missing the point.  Mod rods are a means of mana transfer.
"Extra" mana isn't just useful where encounters are tuned for a
near infinite supply of healing (and/or damage-inflicting) mana.
It's useful in every encounter in the game where you don't have
either enough healing power to keep the tank(s) alive or enough
mana to kill the mob, and it's useful for every guild pushing
their limits.
