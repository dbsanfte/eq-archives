Right, we dont talk about lvl 10 mobs, We talk about good XP giving mobs
in Mid to high levels ...

Hmm, when SK wont cast spells and wont hit any kind of Taunt, SK would
get XP as the Monk would die ;)

The avoidance was nerfed and isnt that good anymore.
And, the mana you save, as you don't need to heal that much == More DoTs
with less agro =)

Compare following mid to high 50th situation:

all chars 55/56 perhaps:
Duo1: Monk/Shaman
Duo2: SK/Shaman

Place: PoN as there is way better XP than other places.
Monk will have to use Stone Stance Disc until Slow sticks. (Ask those
Duos, they wont survive without that) and Shaman needs to Heal alot.
Reuse time of Disc is around 6 Minutes at that Level I think.
Shaman needs to be carefull not to get too much Agro.

SK will pull, hold agro all the time, as he is debuffing snaring ...
So shaman can Slow Dot Heal without beeing Hit.

After Monknerf, Monk will get hit way more than SK while Tanking.

This is Sad, as Monk/Shaman was known as the Best Dou-Tag-Team but SoE
hit them with a real bad Nerfstick =(
