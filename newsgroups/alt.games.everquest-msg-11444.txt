Well after finally finding updated drivers for my Stealth Video Card ( which
I discovered this evening, is not on the approved eq devices list <sigh>). I
loaded them up- got into game and Voila the game worked - or so I thought.
Now I am experiencing the next bug I read about on the message boards at
Sony. The game runs fine then all of a sudden- It Begins to Rain --
Game locks system again- I have to cold boot again. Anyone having rain
lock-ups now or have a possible solution? Thanks.
