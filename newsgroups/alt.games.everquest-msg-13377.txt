Similar thing happened to me when hunting the undead sprite guards.  A horror
jumped me and harm touched, then I get a message that I feel rejuvenated.  There
was no message of 'so and so' begins to cast a spell or whatever you get with
players casting, and there was no particle effect that I noticed like with a
heal.  But nevertheless I got back almost all the HP that I had lost to the harm
touch.

In your message you mention the mage epic possibly being broken because of the
fairies disappearance.  The undead sprite guards seem to drop everything the
fairy guards used to drop including the power of earth, twice woven cloak and
twice woven silk.
