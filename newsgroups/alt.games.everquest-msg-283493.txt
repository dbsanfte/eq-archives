Not sure you would know because you haven't played with DodH yet (?)
but do shrouds solve this issue?

Yes, but with newer augs it will cost you.  I typically pay 1500 or so
to move an augment.  What you need is an augmentatin distiller.  They
are sold in the bazaar.  As you enter from PoK take your first right
and find the first NPC on the right, conveniently next to a augment
pool.  You can also find them for sale in Butcherblook at the LDON camp
and in the Guild Hall.  (GH requires DoN).

Its so easy to get that you may want to think about spending more on
the mana pool and focus effects since you will inevitably loot some
mana regen items on your own sooner or later.
