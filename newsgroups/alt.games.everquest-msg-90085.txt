It's pretty rare, but not incredibly rare.

It's used by tailors to make Fleeting Quivers, which are really
excellent items for high-end archers.

The problem is that many high-end archers have no clue what a Fleeting
Quiver can do for them, and so are unwilling to pay even whit it costs
to make one.

When the Fleeting Quiver finally showed up as a valid recipe, the
highest price I saw on the HQ Lion Skins was 600 plat each, but that
was quite some time ago. I suspect the bottom has fallen out of that
particular market. 

You *might* be able to get a few hundred plat if you can find a
high-end tailor. Certainly don't just sell it to a merchant.
