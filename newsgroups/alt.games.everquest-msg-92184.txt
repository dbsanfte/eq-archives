Which server is this?  Do me a favor, go there again, zone in, see where 
people are medding.  If it is the right side (which means they want you to 
train left), ask why that server zones left.  I'm really curious as to why 
one server would be different than the others on a consensus issue like 
this.  (Also, since I assume that since 90% of EQ players drive on the 
right, they would just naturally train right also.)
