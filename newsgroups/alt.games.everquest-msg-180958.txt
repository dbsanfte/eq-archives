You posted this on several newsgroups where this was an off-topic post:

http://groups.google.com/groups?&as_uauthors=phreakhack

alt.design.grahpics and microsoft.public.webdesign.htlm are certainly not
places one would go to find information about stupid pool tricks.  That fact
that you posted this off-topic drivel in several newsgroups qualifies it as
spam and you as a spammer.  Whether you want to admit that or not.

Nice attempt to backpedal.  But your deeds speak louder than your words:
you spammed and were flamed because you spammed.  You tried to promote a web
site and instead damaged its reputation.

Live with it.
