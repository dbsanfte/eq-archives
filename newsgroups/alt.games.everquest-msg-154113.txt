She does make a valid point, and not all who raid are "uber".  It'd be
awful nice to see large scale high-level encounters where efficiency of
healing was not so critical to success, but frankly I doubt VI is up to
the task of designing such encounters.  There are lots of places where
a group can adapt their tactics to the resources at hand, but I've not
heard of any raid-level boss mob fights where clever tactics allow
a force short on Clerics to compensate with alternative strengths of
the characters present.  For that matter, VI hasn't even come up with
mob special abilities, like the negative-HP buff James suggested, or
a "special" AI, make a CHeal-chain ineffective.
