Even easier than that is after you set it up the way you want it LOCK the
window. If the window is locked it willnot disapier.  I have 12(sone to be
13) windows open. General/ tell-Group/ Spell spam / Skill /
Shout-OOC-Auction(very thin) / My damage / My being damaged / Others damage
/ (next week adding Pet damage to its own window) / Chat channel 1(officers)
/ Chat channel 2 (alliance) /Chat channle 3 ( training -Raid) /And a regular
Raid chat window.

I have never had a Locked window disapier, and never had any of them revert
to some outher use.
