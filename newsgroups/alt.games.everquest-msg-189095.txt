What faction is being farmed BTW? UGuk or Gukta?

I know on Cazic Thule most times I check out LGuk it's very nearly
deserted. Usually only 2-3 people in the zone. There's been a few
times I've been the only person in the zone... this at level 56 BTW,
though I'm at 57 now.

Problem with LGuk is that at 56 everything was greening out. 90% of
MOBs were green or light blue (maybe half each way) and 10% dark
blue... mainly named MOBs.
