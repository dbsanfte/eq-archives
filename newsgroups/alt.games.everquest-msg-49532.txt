So you want to pay 10$ a month to pretty much solo with a chat system
integrated in it?
Maybe if you werent such a dipshit, people would think more of you and
decide to group with you. Oh, and FYI I have seen alot of groups do good in
OS without an enc, bard or necro. They had a harder time, true, but they got
farther than what I would have expected. It's not all about what classes you
have, its also about skills.
Maybe if you got past level 20 you would know that. Go explore the rest of
the place before you make fun of it, it makes you look like the stupid one.

PS If youre having fun in DAoC, knock yourself out. and stop trolling here
while youre at it
