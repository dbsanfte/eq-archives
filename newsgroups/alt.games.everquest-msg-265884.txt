Actually, its -you- who are insisting that we restrict this discussion 
to one very narrow definition killstealing.

First: you made up those stats didn't you? Come on admit it. Those came 
right out of your butt didn't they? 

Second: here's a good example of you trying to force killstealing back 
into that little narrow definition of yours. A definition which is 
clearly not sufficient to describe its usage by CoH players in CoH. 
Based on its usage within the CoH forums, your butt generated statistics 
notwithstanding, of course.
