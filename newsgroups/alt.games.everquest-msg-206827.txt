This is true if your bard wants to wait till 56 to get this part of his 
epic.  If, however, you are interested in the bard as a partner for 
massive slaughter needed to get the cleric epic drops, just pick one 
thats under level 56 so he doesn't have this easy out!

That said, its not as easy as you make out, I've tried it and what 
happens is you aggro the mobs that you are popping back to origins, and 
they wander around angry at you and telling their buddies.  Its easy to 
get dozens of angry mobs all over the area you are running around in 
popping mobs home.  And its hard to tell which one's you've already 
popped back.  So while you don't have to -kill- hundreds of mobs with 
this method you do still have to pop hundreds of them, and you end up 
having to zone out after a bit because the angry mob ratio gets so 
high.  It seems to be a matter of luck as to how long it takes to pop 
the correct mob to his spawn site.  In the meantime, your kill crew is 
sitting there with little to do but wait and hope you get lucky, or pull 
mobs over from nearby.

I'll have to try this again sometime, but since dropping out of my guild 
I no longer have presumed access to the scale I'll need to finish epic 
anyway, and since I didn't do it back at 52, that will be a bit of a hassle.

Since I've started two new alts since that point I'm not sure I'll ever 
get back to it!
