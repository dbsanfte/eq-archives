I've used dx9 since it came out mid last year (actually, I got it while it
was considdered beta, too) it runs perfectly.  I play everquest, unreal
tournament, and terminator 3. no problems at all from t3 and ut. I also
watch alot of dvd's (literal and converted/transferred .vob files) and divx
encoded videos with absolutely no problems what so ever.

And, while im using a much higher end (and specifically supporting dx9)
video card now, I also did this on 32mb geforce2 mx, also with no problems.
