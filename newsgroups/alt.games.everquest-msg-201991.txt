 Well yes, that is your opinion. I personally feel it's a little
misguided. You basically described my guild. Except for the last part.
We are in the Elemental Planes. And as I said in a previous post we raid
at least 5 days a week.

 Basically if the guild is worth joining they won't have a problem
getting people to come to them despite how out of date their webpage may
happen to be.

 Well.. I'm not exactly sure of your level range or how competitive your
server is but for the most part posting a calendar of events is
impossible. Now I'sure some guilds can post their Emperor Crush raid a
week in advance and not have to worry that he wont be up but as you get
higher the mobs are in more demand. You simply can not schedule raids
like that because the mobs lifetime is measured in hours from when it
spawns.

 And you also don't want to post every mob you've killed because then
other guilds will then know when to expect them to repop. Hmm what's
that, you killed Solusek Ro monday night? Oh, I think I'll get my guild
in there early on thursday...
