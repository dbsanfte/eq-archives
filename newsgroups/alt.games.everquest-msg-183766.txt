I would suggest starting on a "normal" blue server and figure out what class
you like. Then re-roll on FV or a Zek if you really want to play on one of
those. Unless of course you have done lots of reading and have friends
already on one of those servers.

The reason for not starting on a Zek is learning a new interface, new game,
and new class, all while worrying about who is around the corner waiting to
kill you, may not let you enjoy the game fully (of course you may just like
the danger element).

You could start and re-roll alot on FV, possibly finding some high level to
hold your cash/items for the new character as you restart, but if you aren't
doing that might as well experiment on a server where you can create 8
different characters easily.........
