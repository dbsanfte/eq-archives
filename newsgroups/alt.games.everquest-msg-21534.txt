    With me it's always the clarity I'm thinking about. I have the weakest
mana recovery of any caster in the game, and I'm the one person who must use
mana on every pull. When I have no mana acceleration, things slow to a
crawl - and EQ at a crawl is just not exciting enough to play.

    Bards are more than adequate, especially if you have a shaman. There are
special instances where other classes work well, too, like having a druid
for Bats in Sol B.

    We never seem to have the room for this. EIther the mob is a caster, or
it summons, or if we try and lure it off for a root it causes adds. I think
the last time I used this was Captain in Karnor's, when we had no enchanter.
(If not for Cel Heal, we could not have stayed. Right after I left and a
higher, better equipped cleric came in without Cel Heal, they trained out.)

>Mana-wise I'm rarely the weakest link... thats the paladins.

    When we need a med break, it isn't for the paladin, it isn't for the
ENCH, it isn't even for the shaman (Cel Heal + Cann = cleric Infuse). It's
for me. Needing a break of any sort is a sign of weakness. ;-)

    My faction standing with Trakanon cannot get any worse. My faction
standing with Venril Sathir cannot get any worse. ;-)

    On high level raids a friend of mine has a better technique - sit down
and die. Amazing how well it works. ;-)

    Ah, XP in raids. Another rant inc.: I gave up caring. On my one and only
Hate raid, the one "KS" group that formed created a huge amount of
resentment amongst everyone else on the raid. Trying to use an Atone/Nuke
strategy doesn't work, as EVERY cleric in EVERY group is doing the exact
same thing. I was under pressure to nuke from my group, so we could "get our
share of kills". The KS group was even breaking mezzes early to get the
damage in, and possibly kill the mob before the first mob was dead.

    Then, on the last day, I joined the ENCH support group. Me, two ENCHs,
the main SHM for the raid, a bard, and a poor druid that had gone LD and
lost his KS group spot. It was wonderful. No worrying about XP - there was
no way we could outdamage anyone. The group chat was almost all shop talk,
and words of support on rolls for drops. I /shouted that ANY broken mezzes
would be Atoned to protect the enchanters, and they stopped cold. The
enchanters and shaman, who had had up to ten deaths per day prior to my
joining, only had one each afterwards - wipeout with a cleric (me) able to
camp. I was a CLERIC on the third day, vital and able to showcase what few
skills I have - not just a healer with poor offensive output.

    Likely not. To me, three stuns is mana intensive, and means the critter
in question cannot be allowed to cast ANY spells. An example is the ICGs in
Crypt in Seb - once one starts trying to CHeal itself, it must be stopped
cold. But most mobs can be allowed to cast spells. Take a typical frog
wizard. If I see it's casting a magic-based nuke on a tank, I don't care. We
have group resist magic, and that spell WILL bounce. So let it cast - saves
me healing mana if it does. So I don't need to have total stun coverage -
just be able to, say, stop two spells in a row.

    I usually have Gate in the second slot. Some people figure if there's
trouble, they can DA, sit and mem Gate, then Gate. But I've found sometimes
the wave of death comes too damn fast. Chef, monk does a poor pull of four
mobs, ENCH is just getting control when two more Krups come in and cream her
in seconds flat. She evaporated. I had enough time to punch Gate and tell
everyone to get out (no evac). Had I DA'ed, I would have had things on me
for the Gate attempt, and likely died beside the enchanter.

    Cel Heal is great for control situations. It is awful for uncontrolled
situations. When we lack control, I want the target healed NOW, as the
target won't last long enough for that second or third tick of healing to
help.

    No, really badly. As in "there are changes required to fundamental group
strategy" badly.

>and clerical attentions

    If I'm doing a me-park, it's to get the thing OFF the ENCH ASAP. That is
exactly where my attention should be. And it tends to be less mana intensive
than chain-healing a constantly interrupted enchanter, as rarely does the
enchanter need more than ONE clear shot to put the mob to sleep.

    You have space to move mobs around without adds, overcoming proximity
aggro to get it glued to you when you move it, and have time to root it
before the enchanter has it sound asleep? Sigh, I miss the outdoors. ;-)

    Turning of the Unnatural is the price we pay for Cel Heal. ;-) VI just
cannot get new cleric spells right, it seems. Maybe it's because our role is
so narrow, but many new spells are either a quantum leap above what we used
to have (and frequently require nerfing), or are total junk.

    Ah, earth pet root. That keeps getting re-applied by the pet, so that
should be OK. But was it working when YOU root-parked something, then tried
to move it?
