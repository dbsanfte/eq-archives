As much as it pains me to admit it, Your right.  I hadn't considered that
fact until after I sent the post and was thinking about the idea later.  Of
course even the idea that if your playing multiple games they could divide
your monthly fee between them (appealing as that might sound) wouldn't work.
I would expect that their answer would be it takes the majority of each of
those monthly fees to pay for the maintenance, salaries, connection fees,
etc..  I really wouldn't have much of a problem paying for more than one
monthly account fee (I have two now, for different computers and am
considering adding another), but it would be nice if there was some way to
consolidate them.
