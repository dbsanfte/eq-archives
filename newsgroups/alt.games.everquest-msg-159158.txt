Yes I know the feeling....
I have been playing (without quiting for over 3.5 years) and I still
run across acronyms I dont know  or can't figure out.
Hehe... never been good  with them to begin with.

Which  reminds me... I have seen this in post  heres and still haven't
figured it out?? IIRC, what the heck does that mean??

I am DEFINATELY not good with DooD speak and don't  want to be!! ;-)
