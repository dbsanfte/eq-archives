You jump a lot do you?
Because unless you have some seriously whacked out character stats,
loss of the stamina bar means absolutely nothing.

And pointing to the existence of the spell invigor doesn't mean much.
Two words:  True North.

As for the rest of your comments about rangers, I have just one thing
to say:  Don't sweat it.  You're not tanks, but you make damn good
pullers.

Especially once you get to level 65 and start hunting in *some* of the
PoP zones.  Hell, as a monk sometimes I perfer rangers to do the
pulling.  With harmony they do a very nice job of dealing with
clustered mobs.
