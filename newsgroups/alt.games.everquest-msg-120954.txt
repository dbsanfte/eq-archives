I have that situation with my 58 Paladin now.  Improved Healing II items
are useless to me, because the only healing spells worth using
at my level are the level 57 Superior Heal, and the level 58
Healing Wave of Prexus.

Sure, I could instead use Greater Healing (level 39), but
even *with* a 20% boost from the Healing II item, it's
inferior to the level 57 Superior Heal.
