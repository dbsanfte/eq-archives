Really, really, REALLY small. Existing beta testers only, pretty much. Both
because they don't have to spend the time figuring the game out, and
because they are apparently getting a playtime head start on non-testers.

Well, I'm not exactly claiming to be nostradamus here, I just made those
numbers up for the sake of arguement.

The engine is stable...until release. All bets are off then.

The team is dedicated...until release. All bets are off then.

I haven't seen a single iota of difference in the attitudes between the
DAoC devs, and the EQ/UO devs when those games were in beta.

There has yet to be a MMORPG game that has had a stable release, and I
highly doubt that DAoC will be the first. The real trouble that the game
will run into will be a few months down the line; Fighting monsters at
level 1 in DAoC is *EXACTLY* the same as fighting them at level 50. The
only difference is that the numbers have scaled up. That is really
goddamned boring. At least in EQ, things change as you level up. There is
NO reason to level up for the PvE game in DAoC aside from ego strokes/sense
of accomplishment. The only reason to level is PvP, and as is well
established: PEOPLE HATE PVP. Once they find out that PvP is the *only*
endgame (and that they are ALPHA TESTING IT, not even beta), subscription
rates will fall through the floor.
