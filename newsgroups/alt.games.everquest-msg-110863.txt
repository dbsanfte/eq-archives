Ever heard the saying: "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth"?

Someone does a nice thing and picks up a stray under leveled character to
let them get some experience only to be whinged about because they got
killed? It's like a parasite whinging at the stupidity of it's host, well,
except even rats are smart enough to flee a sinking ship.

I am still trying to figure out how you weren't the first to die - what
songs were you playing? Health, Mana and a Haste - you should have been
drawing some aggro. You were twisting right? I know it's rude to question
but a level 43 who doesn't recognise cannonballing in a shaman is a bit of a
worry, it like wondering who the heck summoned an Earth Elemental with only
one magician in the group...
