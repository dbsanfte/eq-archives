didn't know that, very cool ;)  helps explain why gf's monk still has her
starting food at lvl 41 (she also forages).  also makes sense with halflings
generally being portrayed as very fond of food ;)

/nod.  knew that about the horses.

you forgot to mention large races (or at least vah shir) also consume food
very quickly (i think they get cut in half even without force feeding).
