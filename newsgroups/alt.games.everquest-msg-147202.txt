Hmm stop me if Im wrong but slavery existed long before the birth of
Abraham, who is generally seen as the beginning of Judeo-Christian
culture. Its as old as warfare to be exact. Study the subject some
before you lay blame for the creation. As for the african slave trade
that was in place long before the first euro stepped foot on African
soil. Not lessening the blame only setting your facts straight. On a
side note, every culture that has practiced slavery has paid a
horrible price for the crime. Divine justice perhaps?
Now for gay rights, or any other rights for that matter, refer to the
current state of affairs of gays in the middle-east to compare the
difference. Besides many of us out here that have no connection to any
church oppose what's being passed off as "gay" rights. 
And btw they have every right to be opposed just as you have every
right to your opinion, wrong and misinformed as it may be.
