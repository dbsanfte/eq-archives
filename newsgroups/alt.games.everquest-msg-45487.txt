Part of the point of a roleplaying server is to
make life difficult for the power crowd. The
language barrier helps with that.

This is simply silly.

Too difficult to program.

again, why? There are a profusion of casters who
can cast bind. Most will do it for free.

Not a bad idea

Probably too hard to program, but not a bad
idea.

How is this different from faction?

Doesn't really add anything to the game- see
above

see above

see above

and this is different how?

sounds good

too difficult to program

how is this different? I know some are under

elaborate further please

good luck with this one- most of EQ's player

But you want more banks than that :) Why not
auction where there are banks?

casters can play in Velious. Mages summon,
wizzies and druids port, shamans buff and slow,
enchanters and clerics cause aggro :)
