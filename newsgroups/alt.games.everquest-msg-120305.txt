I will be installing a new hard disk soon, what should I do
to have a smooth tranfer of the EQ files to the new hhd?
The two hdd-s will , for a time, both be present on my computer.
I have original EQ, Kunark and Velious.
I want to avoid, if possible, a lot of 'patching time' associated with a

new installation.
Also, it would be nice if I could transfer the files associated with
the custom hotkeys of my chars.
Another question, does EQ use the Registry?, can i do a 'directory move'

from my old hdd to the new?

Any comments appreciated.
T.
