They'll want to look for it, but not wear it until twenty or so levels
later. Find some good Mana/HP gear first to get you through the levels
until your INT really starts giving you a serious mana pool. Worked for
my necro, anyway.

Oh, and Ditto on the jboots. If you're going to be soloing, try parking
your new wizzy (after a reasonable number of levels, of course) on the
AC island in OoT and bring your main(s) there to get the camp. Let wizzy
loot ring. Voila. Life will be far sweeter.
