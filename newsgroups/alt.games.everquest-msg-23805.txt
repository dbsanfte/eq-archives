Only item to stack with haste from another item is the Fleeting Quiver
and only for bow delay.

>Max haste you can have is 100%

Yes, at level 60.  Although, there's a slight variance depending on
who you ask.  Anywhere between 100 to 105%.  Personally, I consider
that within tolerance of the idiotic integer math that I'm pretty sure
EQ uses instead of floating point math (although, using floating point
math to calculate delay would cause the server to grind to a halt).

>lowest, effective, delay of any weapon is 10.

Wrong.
Delay CAN get lower than 10.
This false information no doubt is a result of the fact that it is
it's rare to find anyone with significantly lower than 20 delay weapon
and 100% haste cap.
