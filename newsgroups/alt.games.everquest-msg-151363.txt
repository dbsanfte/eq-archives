So it seems that the recent patch fixed most of my link viewing
problems, I do still see the occaisional broken link but its on
the order of 10%, instead of pre patch which was about 90%
broken.

I noticed something I may have simply missed before, when
someone in your group loots, the loot message is itself a link.
So no more looting something, then looking for it in your
bags and setting up a link to it... not unless you are on a raid
anyway.  Oh well, the practice has been good for me, if
I'm designated looter for a KS group on a raid, I'll be ready.

The color of links also changed, to some sort of neon pink, used
to come up blue, but now it turns that color blue only if my
cursor is over it.  Dunno if thats the way it was supposed to
be all along, all I can say is that I did not go in and change any
text colors myself, but there it is.
