You should be able to pick up an Executioners Axe for less than that...I 
only paid 300 for mine. It's 25/50 but procs haste, so the delay isnt 
that bad.

Jagged Blade of War (36/41, procs Rage of Zek)...it can be split into 2 
1hs weapons: The Blade of Tactics (14/24, procs Rage of Tallon) and The 
Blade of Strategy (14/24, procs Rage of Vallon). Its the Warrior epic 
weapon though, so good luck getting it :P
