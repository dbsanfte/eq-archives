Blah. Allakhazam holds nothing on this guy except that he's level 30 or 
so. He's in the Run toward the gypsy camp from the stone bridge in North 
Karana and turn left.  He's in the first building on the right.

Unfortunately, he's on Qeynos faction.

errand for me, you are a life saver. I hate having to turn folks away 
like that. Here is your payment and you have my deepest thanks. 
[Mon Jul 23 02:17:20 2001] Your faction standing with MerchantsofQeynos 
got better.
[Mon Jul 23 02:17:20 2001] Your faction standing with CircleOfUnseenHands 
got worse.
[Mon Jul 23 02:17:20 2001] Your faction standing with AntoniusBayle got 
better.
[Mon Jul 23 02:17:20 2001] Your faction standing with 
CoalitionofTradefolk got better.
[Mon Jul 23 02:17:20 2001] Your faction standing with GuardsofQeynos got 
better.
