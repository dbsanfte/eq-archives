Martin, if you think because Xev hasn't freed the Sleeper because its
guilds aren't capable or are lagging behind, you are horrifically
wrong. Something almost unique to Xev - the top guilds actually get
along - and its worth reminding people that it works on a ffa system,
for those of you still under the misconception that that breeds hatred
and bad feelings. Harm and AV left the warders up on purpose.

Frankly, (Legends of) Harmonium and Altera Vita are as good as any
guild outside the top three out there, and probably better than many.
In this fantasy world where your guild comes over, it's quite possible
it would find itself no better than third on the totem pole.

Not to damage any illusions about Xev or anything.
