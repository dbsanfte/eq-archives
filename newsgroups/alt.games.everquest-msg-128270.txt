a CPU doesnt rely on software to operate most of the time.

and "SoundBlaster" can mean a LOT of cards. from the original 8bit ISA
soundblaster, the SoundBlaster Pro, SB16, SB32, SB64, then the PCI versions
of SB16, all the Ensoniq based SoundBlasters (PCI 64, PCI 128), the Emu10K
SB line (SB 512, SB Live, etc) the SB Audigy, the SB Exidigy, etc..

also, the type of sound card means LITTLE to someone running Windows now.
as long as the sound card has Windows drivers (VxD or WDM), it works. no
need to worry about compatibility or settings.

however, EverQuest is a poor example of working with cards. Verant designed
EQ to use its own custom drivers and bypass what Windows uses (to some
extent). this REALLY breaks some shit.

one way to test this - if you card supports WaveTable midi (either in
hardware, or using some good software, such as the SB SoundFonts, or Yamaha
SoftSynth), and you set Windows to use the WaveTable midi by default -
EverQuest will NOT use it, and instead still use its own midi driver - which
doesnt work right with WDM sound drivers (but isnt so bad with VXD drivers).

also, brining up Sound Cards still doesnt answer "how many programs have you
used that did not tolerate  anon Pentium cpu" ?
