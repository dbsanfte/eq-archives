That's just blatantly wrong.  Even with the most well-oiled instance
crushing machine of a group, I could make faster experience solo in WoW.  A
big part of that is that the experience reward from quests was significant,
so while grinding through a quest I was getting experience the whole time,
comparable to the experience gained with a group in an instance (and better,
depending) and then a big chunk at the end of my grind from finishing the
quest.

You never lost additional experience in certain levels.  Experience loss on
death has always been a flat equation.  It's the actual experience required
per level that had bumps (and in those "hell levels" death actually seemed
to hurt less due to this, with the death the following level seeming to hurt
more due to the contrast).  That's long long long been changed.  WoW's death
penalty is meaningless except for one thing, it punishes warriors (and, by
extension, groups/raids relying on those warriors).

WoW has incredible graphics, and *cohesive* content.  Right up until you get
to max level, then they did the same thing EQ did and start throwing in
everything but the kitchen sink (next expansion, "Kitchen Sink Wars").  For
a casual player who wants an immersive game, I highly recommend WoW.

Those are the most idiotic questions I've seen in a long time. 
Congratulations.  Everybody can learn from everybody, and does so
continually.
