If you had read what I was replying to (aka the lines you snipped),
you would have seen I was replying to someone who wanted to hotkey
spell gems since that'd make it more convenient to cast while typing
out lines, aka. manually clicking the hotkeys, in which case you might
as well click the spell gems.

Me, I'm so used to my hotkeys now that it occasionally takes me a
moment to remember I activate them my clicking and don't have to
finish typing the line I was writing first :)
