Also a lie. Takes 10 minutes for a ranger to solo a rock golem in pov using
the snare, root, shoot with bow method.

Another thing they are not pointing out is that archery is specifically
nerfed for soloing. If the mob is either rooted or moving then archery
dammage is cut in half. I have no problems at all with a rangers ability to
without risk kill a hard pov mob every 10 minutes. I do not even have a
problem with archery dammage and ranger dammage as a whole. The dammage is
situational unlike rogue dammage which is supposed to be but isnt , and we
can use every bit of dammage we can get our hands on :)

Any ranger that dies to even 15 adds is completely incompetent. The mobs
dont move that fast, rangers have inherent sow, and there is a zoneout. Lag
and connection issues can kill anyone though it sems to hate casters the
worst.
