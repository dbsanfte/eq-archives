Thats not so bad, you should see on Veeshan sometimes. I dont mind the 
"selling all on me behind jades", or "selling 3 bags of stuff at bank 
sign", but some people for one reason of the other are starting to 
auction that on EQSN too (the server auction channel). I doubt anyone 
would ever run to NFP to check out what someones selling.
