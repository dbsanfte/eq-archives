Was working fine for me last night.

Yes, I noticed the same, and, they are scattered on the merchant, sorted 
alphabetically, so you actually need to know the name to get somewhere 
near it, otherwise, you have to search and examine to see what tier it's 
for, at least until we all get used to it.

Yep, overall, sucks.  I have armor that I have been passing on to other 
guildies as I upgrade it, much of which was made by fellow guildies.

Don't have a horse, so not really a nerf for me, but, I am not sure I see 
the reason behind it.

Have not done anything but tradeskilling since the patch, as last night 
was raid night in EQ1, so I will reserve comments on the other changes
