Is this an AoE then?  I see some saying yes, some saying no.  Longer cast 
time on the CH would mean you need more clerics in the chain, but, once 
started, the cast time should not be a huge issue in the overall scheme 
of things.  How frequent is the AoE?  Looks like lots of group heals/mgb 
heals will be needed.
