I'm not arguing with your numbers, but do they take into account what
percentage of druids run anonymous vs other classes. Anonymous
characters won't show up on a /who all <class> search.

I don't see too many rogues or warriors running around with the anon
flag on. However, I see lots of druids (if appearances and spells cast
indicate the class) running around anon.
