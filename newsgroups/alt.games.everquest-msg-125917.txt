Actually you become accustomed to it very quickly and is not much of a
hassle at all and if you turn the situation around can actually be of
benefit...ie, if eveyone hates you already then there is no use worry about
keeping good faction all the time ; )

Just keep gather shadows up all the time when travelling, and get in the
habit of reapplying it before heading through a known unsafe area. Keep an
eye out for a circlet of shadows - this makes the job much easier and frees
up a spell slot.

When shadows start to fade - immediately look around for any possible
aggrable mobs so you can hopefully get out of range before it goes
completely. Then re-apply.

It all becomes second nature fairly quickly and I have to say as a dark elf
necro I get generate unexpected aggro less often than on the good characters
I have played, becuase I am expecting it all the time. On the good
characters I would forget to be so careful and get whacked by evil NPC's in
unexpected places quite often.
