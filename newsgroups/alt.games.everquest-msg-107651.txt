So, you paying 400pp for an item means you did more work for that item then the
person who actually went to the location and tried to get it themselves? Paying
money is harder work then actually seeking out the item yourself? I do not
agree with that. Personally, I believe that both people "earned" it, the one
that payed for it (with EQ money) and the one that spent the time getting it
themselves.

The TLC, as believed by a good faction of the EverQuest playerbase, was an
in-affective and useless code. It did not stop farming, it only changed who was
farming. It did not stop the exploitation of people with desired items, it only
changed who exploited people. By making it so that a set of people are not
premitted to get an item, you make it so that another set of people (those that
can get the item) can exploit the first set. Look at it this way. If there is
an item you want to have, you can buy the item from someone or get it yourself.
If someone is charging to much money for it (more then you can afford), you can
buy it from someone else or get it yourself. If everyone is charging to much
money for it, you can STILL get it yourself. The TLC made it so that you could
no longer get it yourself. If you wanted the item, you had to pay for the item
and pay what ever the price that the seller wanted for it. You had no other
options. Hence, the unreasonably high cost of simple easy to get item that were
under the TLC code.

So, only high level players that farm KS people? Sorry that is not true. If you
as a low level was in an area camping something and a high level came along and
KSed you, you do not need a stupid code to keep them from doing it. You have
the basic rules to stop them. Heck, the code did not give you the item if they
desired to KS you anyway. If they KSed you, you both lost the item. I hate to
break this to you, bud, but there are Jerk who play EverQuest. These Jerks know
no bondaries or limitation. To steriotype all groups of people in a style of
game play as a Jerk because of one person doing one thing one time against you
is wrong. It would be the same as saying that all low levels who got items
under the TLC were exploiting their advantages when the sold it to high levels
by charging more then it was worth. Both statements are wrong.

Does it matter what my alternate character went through? It is not a real
person, I am the real person. My alternate does not spend real money. My
alternate does not pay the bills. My alternate does not take real life time to
get an item. My alternate is not the payer of the price for obtaining the item.
Neither is mine main/high level. I am the payer of the price. It is my
investment of time that "earned" me the money. And since I invested something
that I own, I should be allowed to do with it what I wish. If you want the
item, you invest something you own be it your own time gaining the item or your
time gaining the money to buy the item. But, you should not require me to give
you that which I payed for on my own.

What Risk-Reward? Do you mean that the risk of not leveling with my high level
character in the time invested, not staying up with those levels I normally
group with, possibily dieing (and yes, high levels can die from green mobs) and
not getting a rez for an item, the value of spending 2-3 years gaining level to
do something. Do you mean to tell me that all of these Risks are not enough for
the Reward of some lowly vitural pixial item that I want for one of my
alternatives? Ah, again I do not like your defination of what is a sufficient
Risk. It does not agree with my defination of sufficient Risk. And since I do
not see you in a position of authority to make the judgement call of assigning
the value of Risk to an action, I do not feel I need to follow it. Why do you
not follow my value of Risk? I believe I am just as much in a position of
authority to make the value judgement calls as you, so why is your value better
then mine?

Oh, and by the way, a person that buys an item which is dropped or quested from
a mob/area that the person themselves cannot go/kill, how is that different
from someone placing said item on an alternative that could not go. A level 20
who saved money to by a Wurmslayer could not possibly get the Wurmslayer by
killing the mobs for the quest pieces. How is that different from a level 60
killing the quest mobs, getting the Wurmslayer, and placing it on their level
20 alternative? Many people against twinking feel it is ok for them to buy
items they could not get but it is not ok from someone else to camp or work for
the item themselves. Why?

What "facts" are you getting straight here? I see no facts listed. This whole
paragraph is very confusing. Are you trying to suggest that the more a person
twinks an alternative,  the more they want uber items, the more they will beg?
I do not see the connection. Why would someone who already has an uber item beg
someone who has less for something less? Heck, I believe those that beg a lot
are those that lack the ability to twink their alternate character and not the
other way around. Just like those that BEG for SoW do so because they cannot
cast SoW themselves.

Low Level True Newbies do not know what a "heck of a lot of damage" is. They do
not know what a weapon does. Most of them often thing they are fighting wrong
when they do not have high damage and not because they have poor weapons or
just because they are lower level. Most of the Lower Level True Newbie does not
even know what all the numbers running across their text window is for. And
that is even if they have "Other Hits" on. Without "Other Hits" turned on, you
have no idea what damag someone is doing. Heck, even with "Other Hits" turned
on, it is very difficult to REALLY know if someone is out-damaging another
without parsing a log file. I can assure you that most Low Level True Newbies
would not know how to parse a log file, how to create one, or even with it is
stored. Without that, they have nothing to use to compare their damage with
anyone else other then their possibly mistake beliefs.

How is it that a True Newbie would know that the plate/chain you have could not
be obtained from a vendor? What is their reference to make that conculsion
since they would have enough "sense of intelligence" to know they have not yet
been to every vendor in the game? Heck, they know they have trouble finding out
which NPCs are vendors and which ones are guild masters and which ones are
simpily NPCs. Let alone to know which ones does/does not sell the items you are
wearing. No, sorry. Those low level players that have an inferiority complex
with other low level players over gear are themselves not "True Newbies". They
are just people who lack the ability to twink to the degree that others can and
are upset because someone else is doing something they want to do. I tell you
that a "true newbie" does not have a problem with twinks because a "true
newbie" does not know what a twink is. They cannot be upset for doing less
damage because they have no point of reference to know what less damage is. The
ones that are upset with twinking are the ones that say "It is ok when I do it
but not ok when you do it".

alternate characters beg>

Sorry, a "true newbie" is to intemidate by the whole experience of EverQuest,
normally. They are to intemidate by others playing the game. They have a hard
time asking question like "where is the ranger guild in Kelethin" during their
first set of experiences in playing the game. They do not even know what a
Wurmslayer is or what SOW means. Most of them make it to level 14-20 before
they understand what "bind" means. They would not beg. Only those that know the
worth of 5pp in an old server would beg for items and high amounts of platinum.
Only those that know what SoW is and does for you will get upset about you
refusing to give it. Beggers are not a newbie occurance. Beggers are an
experienced players occurance because they know that there ARE some people out
there that will give them something just to shut them up.

Yes, this is what I am saying. YOU did not beg when you started the game new.
YOU did not know what an exceptable level of equipment was for the first 20
levels or so was when YOU started the game new. YOU did not do many of the
begging demands that you are so against when YOU started the game new. This is
the same with the majority of those that start the game new. It is only those
that DO KNOW the game and start a new character that beg. It is only those that
DO KNOW what is exceptable level of equipment in the first 20 levels of the
game who have problems with others twinking. They have problems because others
are doing that which they KNOW is possible based on their already obtained
knowledge yet are unable to do themselves. Sure many of them place high moral
reasons behind them not doing it by saying "I am go good to twink". But you
know what? IF a person was truly of the state that they would not twink their
own character, they would not care about others twinking. Heck, those that are
truly on the state that they would not twink their own character would want
others to twink. Why? Because that would give them a since of accomplishment to
be able to achieve something that the majority of players do not and cannot
achieve. They can reach the same high levels again without ever twinking.
Hence, they are better then anyone else.

Sure, there are people that believe that they would want them to get rid of
No-Drop items. Sure there are some that believe they want Verant to make it
possible for them to buy or trade for all items in a quest. But you know what,
most people do not realize that what they think they want is not necessarily
what they want. People say they want to have No-Drop status removed from items,
that way they can do the quest easier or get the item easier. But you know,
easy quests are not liked. Easy obtainable items are not cherished. The more
work someone places into completing a quest or getting the items, the more they
cherish the rewards for their work.
