I have to backup what a few others have said, that basicly 35 Hp and 2 Wis 
is better than 2 AC.  

One hit?  Yeah, but it sure as hell ads up over your suit.

My Base HP are 1579, but thanks to all those little HP boosts (and some 
thanks to sta) I'm normally at 2326 HP.  Nope, those 15 hp on the earrings 
aren't much, but they certainly add to the pool.
