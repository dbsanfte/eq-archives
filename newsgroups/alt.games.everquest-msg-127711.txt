    Ready to laugh? We have one in recruitment now. ;-) Warrior, level 60,
crafted bracer. He's a very odd case, though - a friend of a guildy, he
bought the one SoD in circulation on the server. So he has a SoD and a
Crafted Bracer. It's iffy if he'll get in, but it's not the gear - it's the
language barrier and how it translates into slow reaction time for a class
that has to react fast.
