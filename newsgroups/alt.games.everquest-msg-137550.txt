It's still theft. The least you can do is be honest about it.

If he had made a sincere attempt to find the true owner, and failed, then I
would accept him keeping the items a lot more easily. However, he shrugged
it off and made a profit.

True. I'm not saying that thieves in EQ are neccessarily horrible people in
real life, although there probably is a connection to poor behavior on EQ
and poor behavior in RL. However, thieves still do ruin the experience for
others. If you have no problem screwing someone over for something
miniscule, what does that say for yourself when something valuable comes up?

Well, in this scenario, "A stranger is just a friend that steals your
items."
