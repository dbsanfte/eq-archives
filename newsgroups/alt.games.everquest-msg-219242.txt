I'd wonder why you thought there need to have been one?

Four years of expenience, being exposed to hundreds even thousands of 
opinions, few of them, if any, ever expressed "EQ Tradeskilling is 
Perfect the way it is. There is nothing I would do to improve it."

Most tradeskillers I encounter like the 'idea' of being a tradeskiller 
in EQ, far far far more than the actual 'act' of tradeskilling in EQ.

No. That is my assessment of the tradeskill system. And I *am* a 
tradeskiller; I do enjoy being able to make things, and I enjoy the 
meta-'tradeskill game'... but actually sitting on my ass performing 
combines to skill up? I can see lots of room to improve.
