}Just about all, if not all, of those blocked accesses are people
}"knocking".

I'd easily agree to just about all.  But we know hackers exist.  We know 
script kiddies exist.  And the existence of malevolent idiots is 
unquestionable.  I'd go for 99% "knocking" pretty easily.

}I haven't had ZA on my computer since changing systems
}because I've been too lazy to install it, and haven't had any such
}"strange things" turn up. Unless you've actively attracted the
}attention of hackers, chances of someone hacking you are probably less
}than someone breaking down your front door and robbing your home.

I really doubt I actively attracted malevolence to my IP address, which 
changes every time I'm forced to reconnect or reboot, but it is possible.  
After all, I post here and on several web boards, that's bound to tweak 
someone's nose at some point.

}Yeah, it's good to be careful. But you're being absolutely paranoid,
}which is just...neurotic.

Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get me. :) Or 
more to the point, just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean there aren't 
assholes out there trying to do naughty things to randomly accessible IP 
addresses.
