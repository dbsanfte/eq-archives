New trivial: 18. My skill is low- to mid-30s. I'd say double the
trivial level is *way* trivial.

I understand that. My gripe is that you become good enough to not
improve by making it, but not good enough to make it with any sort of
reliability. That doesn't jive. Their formula is not realistic.

I don't care if they say, "You failed again, you insufferable moron.
You are not worthy. Go flog yourself! If you bring the weak stuff in
here again, I'll gouge out your eyeballs and [beeeeeeeep] you!"

I'm not nitpicking the term, I'm complaining about the fact that once
something does become trivial - in the sense that it no longer
provides skill-ups - it should involve a higher success rate.
Otherwise, I should continue to improve.

I am aware of that as well. As I said in my other post, I was just
throwing down any information related to my smithing experience. I
should have been more clear.
