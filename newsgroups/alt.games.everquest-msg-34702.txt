I guess it really comes down to how much of a hassle it is for you. My 
enchanter hasn't done a lot of enchanting-for-hire. The few times I've done 
it I've charged just a pittance - usually just a gold per bar.


One time a guy comes up to me while I'm soloing in Blackburrow:

D-in_math says: Could you enchant some silver for me?
Me says: Sure, how much do you need done?
D-in_math says: I have twelve bars. How much?
Me says: How about 1pp for the lot?
D-in_math says: I guess so. That's a little high though. I usually don't 
have to pay more than 1gp per bar.


*sigh*
