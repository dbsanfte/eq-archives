 More than likely 80+ from what I heard. That's assuming you can turn
them in. I'm guessing you can since some have said they've done it, but
I wasn't able to get in trading range without aggroing the marines in
front of him. In the past people used to train him out then have someone
hail him but I don't think that works anymore. When he walks back he
doesn't stop for hails.

 Not that I'm aware of. Only other thing to do is get in faction hits on
Kunark dragons which may be a bit tough depending on your current level.

 Specultion on my part would be to answer this with a "no."

 All of them. Also Esorpa of the Ring in Western Wastes. Don't expect it
to move very fast from KoS though. I was on at least 8 VP clearings
along with some Talendor and Gorenaire kills thrown in and never made it
out of scowls.

 Only other way I have heard was to get puppet strings from Plane of
Fear and charm the Foreman. Apparently pets are amiable to their owner.
You'll need to bring a shaman/enchanter with you though to lower
foremans MR or you'll probably get resisted on the charm.
