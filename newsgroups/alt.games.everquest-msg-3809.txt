[reply on bottom]

One thing I wondered is, how come if I loot a dead mob when I dont have
anymore room, it tells me, "you have no room in your inventory....," but it
does not do this during trade.  Sure, I should make sure that I have room
first.. but.. I do this only because I know of the circumstances (which is
what Im arguing) that take place during a trade when I have no room.

It would probably eliviate many /petition 's, along with a lot less
heartache when this happens to someone.  No, this has never happened to me
fortunately, but, I know many others it has happened to, both personally and
seeing those infamous ooc's "could someone please return my wurmslayer to me
that I accidentally dropped on the ground...", etc...
