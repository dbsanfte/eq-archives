It would be best to know from beginning what type of weapon will i use so
i won't waste any practice points! Right?
What is the best 1HSlashing Sword or Axe in the game?
Or how about 2HSlashing? I believe the best compination would be 1HS +
SHIELD?
Am i right or wrong? What Experiences do you have?

>> And another question goes like this What are the most important

>get dx to 75 and then split between str and sta however you like


What is the advantage If i have Dexterity 75?

>> Bash, Taunt? What they do? Are they useful for soloing?

>Bash interrupts casters , taunt gets you hit instead of the casters ,

So if i like to solo i should develope Kick and Bash
