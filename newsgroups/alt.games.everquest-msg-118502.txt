Speaking of components - why don't the spell descriptions (when you right click
on the scroll or spell icon) show needed components?  Back when AC first came
out, I had a magician and I seem to recall at that time the pet spells actually
showed what component was needed, but this is no longer seems to be the case.
If I remembered correctly, why on earth did Verant take that out?
