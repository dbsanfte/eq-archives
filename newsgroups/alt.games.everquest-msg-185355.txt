I am a 54 High Elf Enchanter. This is my typical lineup:

1: Color Skew       - 44th Level 8 second AoE stun
2: Dazzle           - 49th Level 96 second Mezz
3: Color Shift      - 20th Level 6 second AoE stun
4: Berserker Spirit - 200hp shield buff (the best "heal" we get :)
5: Root             - 8th Level, max 48 seconds
6: Shiftless Deeds  - 44th Level slow spell
7: Tashania         - 44th Level MR debuff
8: Theft of Thought - If fighting casters (gives MOB's mana to you)
   or Fascination   - If Trains are likely (AoE Mezz - 36s I think)

I find the two Color spells are enough to stun-lock mobs completely.

Dazzle's cast time doesn't worry me as it always seems castable on a
Color-stunned mob and I like the extra breathing space which the 96
second duration gives.

I always have Berserker spirit on me as it effectively adds 200hp
which, at a fully buffed 1k hp, is a 20% increase. I also seem to get
fewer interrupts when the mob is hitting the shield instead of me. It
is the nearest thing us Chanters get to a heal as you can put
Berserker Spirit up - get hit to get your animation in on the fight.
Drop it (if the mob didn't hit you enough to drop it) and recast. This
means you can take 200 hp of damage without getting hurt which is the
equivalent to getting hurt for 200hp and then healing for 200hp.

The lowest level, fastest casting Root is all I need as if I want
something held for longer I'll mezz it and the mana cost of Root is
negligable. Usually I only use Root to help the Taunter regain aggro.

If my group does not have a Slower then I'll keep Shiftless Deeds
here, if they do then I'll maybe have the Fascination & ToT
combination up instead.

Tashania I wouldn't go without - I cast it in every fight. On some
mobs it makes no difference but on many it does and it is quick &
cheap to cast.

Theft of Thought is a fantastic spell when you are fighting casters.
Only downside is that it has to have it's own slot due to the recast
time.

I like to keep Fascination ready if I know there will be a chance of
several adds. For one or two adds a couple of stuns & Dazzles does the
trick nicely.

I generally swap out Tashania for utility buffs when they need casting
and then drop it straight back in again.

All this really does depend on what I am fighting of course but I
would say, unless I am fighting non-mezzable and/or non-stunnable mobs
(eg most Giants) then I will always have the first three memmed.

I agree wholeheartedly with your thoughts on single-pulls. We were
made to control crowds and the feeling you get when you stop a
group-slaughtering train is a real rush!
