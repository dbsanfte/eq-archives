After much prodding from the a.g.e regulars, I decided to have a go at 
soloing in Kael Arena. I cleared my way inside, and pulled a named mob, 
in this case, one Bjorak Stonefist (which I later found was a merchant 
anyway).

At any rate, I found that his summon rate was faster than my big fire 
nuke cast time, so I was reduced to use DoTs and try to take the 
pounding. This took a lot of time and a lot of mana, and I started 
getting repops that cut the attempt short.

So, is there a more workable strategy for a 65 druid (in laughable gear) 
to solo summoning mobs, particularly the giants in Kael?

Thanks.
