So was I the only one getting a distinct night & day in GFay?  The day
was misty and foggy, but definately day...looked like an irish day.

Night was dark and oppressive...wood & high elf infravision is not
what it's cracked up to be.

Another thing...orc pawns used to carry torches at night, but now
since it's eternal night, they carry them all the time.

Doesn't make much story sense...all those trees would have died from
lack of sunlight.
