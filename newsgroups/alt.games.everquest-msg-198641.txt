That's just it. That "good fit" doesn't necessarily have to do with the
fact that the optimum zones are the same for everyone. That "good fit"
should remain if some people level up to the point where they can
feasibly play in zones others can't. 

Good guild (imho): "Awesome! I made it through the trials! I can now get
into the better xp zones. Now let's try and get the rest of my friends
through." 

Bad guild (imho): "Awesome! I made it through the trials! Sorry people,
but I can get much better xp elsewhere. Look me up when you get
flagged."

If a player was in a tight-knit guild before, that shouldn't change, 
again imho. Semper fi, ya know?
