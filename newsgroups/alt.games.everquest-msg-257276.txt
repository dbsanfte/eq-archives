Hmmm, the forged velium throwables don't seem to have the Velium
Shards proc on them -- unlike the forged velium melee weapons.
On the other hand, all the Type 4 augments seem to work on range
weapons as well. It might be way useful to have one's pulling
shuriken or whatever proc Mirror or Ykesha in addition to the
1 pt of regular damage... Not sure if 30-1500 ldon points meets
your criteria of "cheap" though :)
