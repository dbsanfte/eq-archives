Actually it did and last I knew it still does.  There was a time when you
could buy egg-shaped pumice, same as crystal pumice nowadays except was
insta-cast.  Well some still have them and they tell me that to get more you
just sell one with at least 1 charge remaining to a vendor and then you
could buy back one with all its charges - expensive exercise though.  They
said Verant was aware of the problem but the effort to fix it so that
vendors didn't sell back fully recharged items wasn't worth it.  Maybe they
have fixed it now but it was possible at some point, at least with pumice.
