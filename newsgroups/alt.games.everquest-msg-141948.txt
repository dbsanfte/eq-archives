When I had to buy a new printer I got an Epson Stylus Photo 820.
Not only was it affordable, fast, and could make photo-quality
prints, but I was very pleased to discover that the color
cartridges (and BW as well) cost less than $20 (retail, down
near $10 ordering online), unlike my previous printer, the
cranky, slow, low-quality HP 520C.  I highly recommend it.
