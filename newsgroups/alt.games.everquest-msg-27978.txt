My advice is just ignore all these people. Regardless of whether a
shaman is theoretically a better healer, in practice I have fun with
my cleric, groups are very easy to get and right or wrong most people
would much rather have a cleric for healing. Oddly enough most of the
shaman and druids I've met want a cleric in the group. Very few like
being the primary healer. And I've never had an invite just because I
could rez.
