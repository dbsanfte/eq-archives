I normally sing slow, haste, heal and melee, and monk has no real trouble
keeping most of the aggro with this combo running.  Same with slow, haste,
DD.  As I said, its charm thats the trouble.

Solo, my charmed pet takes damage while it kills my target.  So I end
up eventually fighting a substantially damaged pet, and my relatively
wimpy bardic melee is more than up to that task.  But with monk
partner, the monk either has to stay out of the fray (in which case
why is she there?) or she gets aggro and my pet just helps.  Which
is still fine... except when we run out of victims and its time to kill
off the pet, which is perfectly healthy and simply will -not- switch
to the monk (who has no Taunt skill)

Not indoors I don't.  Pixie and run away, or when mobbed fear and
run away... but I'm not looking for tips on how to survive, I'm looking
for tips on how to duo more efficiently.

At this point I"ve resorted to "monk pull singles using FD and we
fight." and for adds, Pixie Strike mezzing.  Thing is those adds
are normally my bread and butter, the most effective damage
production I can do is having the mobs fight each other... instead
I'm having the mobs twiddle their thumbs.
