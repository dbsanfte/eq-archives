It doesn't affect us too badly here in Oz at all - we know that patch night
and patch repair nights are going to be completey nuked for us - we know not
to even bother trying. Only a very stupid Australian get's caught out
staring at a login screen for half a night, whereas with "the majority"
sometimes it's worth playing post patch - sometimes it's not. The only way
for them to find out is to spend the "half night staring at a login screen".

Me sitting back relaxing over a few beers in the local pub thinks playing
from Oz is mighty good indeedie.....  : )
