i played SB in beta, and even then i could tell the pvp was very cool

for example.....in EQ, you kill players...that's it......you can go to
kelethin and kill all the elf PC's and then the elf NPC's, if you wanted

they would just respawn.....

in SB you can burn the player-made towns and ALMOST feel like you're in a
real place

in DAoC, the structures just changed hands....SB was a little better

okay, okay...maybe it is just DAoC all over again =p
