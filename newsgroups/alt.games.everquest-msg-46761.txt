Don't bother, they trashed everybody's characters.  Everybody is now
level 24 with whatever eqp they had.  With the trivial loot code in,
there is almost no easy way to make quick cash.   The server goes live
Monday.

I had a level 9 druid who had JUST obtained a magic bloodforge hammer
and I was ready to start harvesting wisps for easy cash, and then they
take it down.  When I come back, I'm level 24 and CANNOT get any kind
of lightstones or GLS's off of any wisps any more.  I have 1 level 9
spell and no cash in the bank.  Time to wait for the server to go
"live", no point in playing any more.

Maybe we can have a big PvP bash or something?
