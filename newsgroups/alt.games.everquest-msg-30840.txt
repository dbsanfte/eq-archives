Bring a friend who can cast Invis on you (you will *not* be
able to do it properly yourself).  A Bard with the invis song
works great also.

Put 4 mini-stacks of 4 Red Wines in the trade window.  Then have
someone cast invis on you at THIS point (if you do it earlier,
initiating the trade will break the invis, which is why you
can't do it yourself).  Then press the Give button.  Ta daa.

After a few rounds of this, you won't need the invis anymore.
Giving him Red Wine raises faction standing with him VERY fast.
