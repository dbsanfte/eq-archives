Donal's Armour is mostly about the AC - only the legs & BP are useful
for their stats.  Most of the effects are, as you correctly point out,
a joke.  Though the boots & gloves are still quite nice & the arms are
OK, the rest (including the BP these days) is pretty useless.

Go for Velious armour if you're after stats and AC, EM if you're just
after stats, Donal's if you're just after AC.  Thurgadin stuff is easy
enough to obtain and decent quality, Kael & Skyshrine considerably
harder, but much better too.

As for melee, well... just for fun, I tried an experiment at level 54
with a borrowed Sash of the Dragonborn, Yaulp IV, 225 STR, and an 8/19
weapon against a Howling Stones mob.  Total melee damage output over an
approximately 60 second fight: 220.  Ho hum.
