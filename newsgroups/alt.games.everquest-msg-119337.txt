With a melee class the main thing is to have a Sta over 100 and there are
lots of item out there to do this. In combat with an sta under 100 when your
stanama bar runs out you will slow down your hitting, if its over 100 its
very little difference if any. On my Monk I put my extra points 5str 5dex
and 10agi. With gear I have found or bought all my main stats (str,
sta,dex,and agi) are in the 130 plus range unbuffed.
