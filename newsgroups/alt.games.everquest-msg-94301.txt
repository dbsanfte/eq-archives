I think the plan was to force people out of the MA - CH chain
mode of killing, force them to develop new tactics.

If you're going to use AE tactics on truly tough mobs, I'm
thinking you're also going to want multiple 'chanters to 
chain stuns, multiple clerics to group heal the nukers.

I know a typical AE group is Cleric/Chanter/Chanter/3(Wiz/Mage)

I think each group is *really* going to need a cleric.

If you're going to level people just for AE groups, look
around for 51+ mages as well.  A lot of semi retired 51+
mages out there would be happy to come back if they were
an integral part of the damage dealing, rather than being
mod/trans rod whores on raids.
