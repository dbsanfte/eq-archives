I had a newbie ask to inspect me yesterday...I said sure, he did. I get a tell
from him saying "Wow, all your stuff is incredible!!" (it's not...nice, but
hardly incredible..ok, with one exception). I laughed it off...the next tell I
got was him asking me if I had anything I could spare. Sadly, I wasn't
surprised.  I gave him a skull of Jhen'tra that I'd been holding for my monk
(for her sash/headband quests), that I can easily obtain again.

He thanked me. Then I get another tell from him (which, it seems, was meant for
someone else) saying "I got a skull of jhen'tra!"

now, this could easily have been him, genuinely excited that he got a relatively
nice item for a newbie, but it seemed kind of suspicious to me. Oh well, I
didn't say anything to him, and hope that I actually helped him.
