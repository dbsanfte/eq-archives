Um, no, I won't come rez you, have the shaman do it.

Anyone that -didn't- turn me down for a group is welcome to free rezzing 
as long as I'm not busy, you, however, are temporarily on the "do not 
rez" list.

Sadly, clicky clerics are so prevalent now, and its so easy to get to 
bodies in POP graveyards, that this is no longer a good stick to hold 
over their heads to go along with the carrot of a class with stuns, fast 
heals, group heals, still by far the best Cheal in the game, lull, root, 
melee damage (well, only post 56 and no longer competitive by elemental 
levels); all grouping a cleric does for you in terms of rez is relieve 
you of the indignity of having to beg/bribe someone to do it for you.

And this lot clearly didn't prize their dignitity, I'd frankly ask 
-anyone- but the guy I'd turned down, and if I couldn't find someone I'd 
dry loot and eat the exp rather than do that.

I have on occaision turned someone down as not needed... but what I 
meant was we have only one slot left and we -need- a (mezzer, slower, 
porter... ) and your class isn't that.  I've also turned people down for 
being far outside my level range and IMO inappropriate for the camp 
we're doing; I don't want a level 65 pulling down the exp if we are 
doing a mid 40s camp, and I don't want a 40 leeching exp in a group 
where he isn't able to stick anything to the mobs because we are killing 
stuff thats level 60+

Someone in my level range, asking to join a group that already has the 
basics covered or that has more than one slot open?  I hardly ever turn 
that down... if I do its probably cause I have them on ignore as they've 
grouped with me before and proven to be asses.

All that goes double for guild mates, though, I'll stretch any point I 
can to include a guildmate; while the idea of being friendly to clerics, 
enchanters, and warriors on general principle is fine, doing the same 
for guildmates is clearly in the best interest of the guild as well as 
myself.
