I'll take that as a compliment.  By way of explaination.  I put the 
quote the bit I am replying to at the top so that it follows on without 
forcing people to scroll past pages of text.  Then I put the full post 
at the bottom so that, if people want to, they can read the whole thing. 
  IMHO it's the best way to work.  I guess I'm alone in that.  But I'm 
not gonna change because a few ignorant malcontents start swearing at me 
in USENET.
