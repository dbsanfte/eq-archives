The way that SOE tells you to fix the problem leaves twomany ports open, and
trigerable from an outside source.  They tell you to open up like 3400
continuose ports, rather than tell you what ports the system works on (they
Pride in keeping that to them selfs).  IF you open all the ports that they
tell you to a snooper can see all the computers behinde your
Router/Firewall.  Here's what I do.  When I go on everquest, I go to
routersetup and change mycomputer to the DMZ spot. then when I get done I
deselect the dmz address.  This works if you only have one computer at a
time playing EQ, and have a good Firewal program running( zonealarm, NPFW,
ect.).  If you have more than one on at a time, you will have to do it there
way.

I would do it there way, but I like my privacy.
