Somewhat amusing related story. On a different server than mine, a
player (who was obviously more than a bit miffed at the CS folks he had
met there) apparently had a serious grudge out for a particular GM. (not
Guide... GM). Let's call the GM "Bob".

The player starts a new character and levels it straight up to 20 for
the sole purpose of being able to request the Surname of "Bobcybers". 
It's not long before it gets petitioned. (Hell, he may have asked
somebody to to it or petitioned it himself.) Obviously it's got to be
changed, but he's selected a time when there's no Seniors online, and
Bob, the GM, *IS* online. Bob now shows up to correct the matter
himself.

There followed a short conversation in /ooc where the player was saying
things to the effect of, "You've got to stop following me around this
way." and "We can't keep meeting like this." and "I really don't think
this relationship is going to work out."

It would have gone easier on this chap, I imagine, except that he
supposedly had attempted to switch his default chat from /group to /say,
but instead hit /ooc.

People got a huge laugh out of it, apparently, except the GM who flagged
the character from ever getting a surname and suspended him for a bit.
How he didn't get banned is beyond me, but it was still amusing.
