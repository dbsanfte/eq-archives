No, it isn't.  However, I don't even have the 2D targeting ring.  Such a
pain when the tank tells the group to assist and still has the wrong mob
targeted (he might not even realize it if he aggro'ed one mob while
pacifying another of the same type).  Nothing like that sinking feeling of
seeing Jobober running to the wrong target.  I put a giant "Back Off" button
on my UI, but when Gararn starts off by casting, it's already too late.
