Never.  Ever.  The only thing that gets better is that you will get some
resist debuff spells.

My personal favorite is Ro's Fiery Sundering (39 Druid), at least in terms
of druid line debuffs, I've never played an enchanter so I can't speak much
about tash line except for proccing it off my Jstick, which doesn't happen
nearly enough.  Anyways, Ro's Sundering is a lure based spell, so it's
virtually NEVER resisted  (at level 40 I can land it on red drolvarg ragers
in DL, and red Ice giants in Everfrost)  Ro's sundering is a ~40 Fire resist
debuff, and a minor AC debuff (5-10 or so), Velious drop only spell, I've
seen it drop from the lesser shardwurms (no ancients, elders or crystalline)
and Ry'Gorr elites, as well as hearing about it dropping in upper ToFS,
which is where my friend druids all got their copy.

Then at 52 we get Breath of Ro, which, while resistable, gives a ~30 fire
debuff, ~20 ac debuff and does 920 dmg in 1 minute from DoT, stacks with
Epic effect, Winged Death, Immolate and Drones of doom (or Drifting Death)

And at 53, Glamour of Tunare, an animal only, unresistable AFAIK, 20 point
magic resist debuff.

And the King of the Hill, Ro's Smoldering Disjunction at 56, which is
resisted regularly unless you open with Fiery Sundering for it's debuff
(which is overwritten by disjunction AFAIK), but gives ~65 fire resist , ~60
ATK, ~25 AC and a minor 150 dmg DD, unfortunately the DD component ups
resist rates on it massively due to single spell multi effect resist rate
issues.

Oh, and at 49 Fire, with 50 cold resist debuff, and Ice with 50 fire resist
debuff, but these are both just nukes with a VERY short term debuff
component on them.

There's also Fixation of Ro at 44, but it's only an ATK/AC debuff, no resist
lowers; and from what I hear, this spell rightfully deserves its nickname of
"Fizzle of Ro" because for no apparent reason it has nearly 3x the fizzle
rate of same level same skill spells.

Magicians and Shaman get the Malo line of debuffs that reduce
cold/fire/magic and poison.

Necro's get the Scent line that reduces fire/poison and disease.

Bards get Occlusion of Sound, minor, but every bit helps a lot in some
cases, cold/fire/magic debuff.

Enchanter Tash line is Magic resist only though.

That's about all I can tell you about resist debuffs, lol, everything but
druid stuff is straight out of the spdat parser.
