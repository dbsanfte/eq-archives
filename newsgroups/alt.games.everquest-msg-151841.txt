Personally my main is a now 52 wizzy, and i lov it, ive tried a dru and it
was so -so, i delted it to go for a shammy if iwant a buffer. Id say stick
with the wizzy, lvling is a pain but come 36 er so when Bonds of force
sticks go get a sow potion (or jboots if u can afford them) and go quading
in Eastern wastes, this was good untill 46 for me and the tusk s u get to
turn in in CS got me enough plat to get jboots, i still had a tough time and
my guild leadr said stick it out till 50, and im glad i listened, few levels
after ice comet and better spells (aoe & pbaoe) your second to none, theres
nothing greather then going back in to lguk and dropping the whole sage room
pops a cast or 2 of super nova, as far as raiding goes, drus ake good back
up healers, but theyre a dime a dozen 4-5 servers ive played on there are
way to many druids, and after 5+ they dont have alot to offer on a raid
besides junk buffs to fill spots for the aego & kei so they dont get
cancelled, i know this will piss some of u drus off out there, dont get me
wrong id play a dru to 60 to pl other toons but as far as the 2 classes goes
imo wizzies have to stuggle a bit in the begginging but in the end are 2nd
to none~
