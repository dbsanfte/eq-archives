My son only has a 20 meg harddrive and with all three expansions, plus
Windows XP Home he is about out of space. Does one HAVE to load all
expansions to get all the benefits of play or can you just load the latest
one or some combination that will take less hard drive space?

Planes of Power took up about 2220 MB of disk space by itself. The others
are fairly modest in hard disk usage.

Thanks,
Gary
