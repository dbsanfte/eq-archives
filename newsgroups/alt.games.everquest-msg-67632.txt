Wrong.  Go read the Play Nice Policy at:

http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/conduct.jsp

Item #7 says:

	"You may not defraud other players.

	Fraud in all transactions between players will result in
	disciplinary action when confirmed by an internal EQCSR. Fraud
	is defined as falsely representing one's intentions to make
	gain at another's expense. Examples of this activity include
	but are not limited to offering to drag the corpse of another
	player to safety but instead hiding it deeper in the dungeon
	as well as using flaws in a secure trade window to deprive
	someone of one of their items."
