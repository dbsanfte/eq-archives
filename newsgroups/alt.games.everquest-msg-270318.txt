Going through this process myself...

Yep. They appear to be serious. Looks like there's a one month window on 
creating the free accounts, but once your in its free until next 
January.

Ah... this confused me too.
On the matrix you want the last column. The first columns have free 
downloads for the full game including different expansions, but you only 
get a 14 day trial, not a free year with those. And signing up for that, 
requires CC authorization for 19.95 (for the game with expansion) and 
the subscription fee which will automatically be charged unless you 
cancel before the free trial is over.

The last column however, is a free download, free signup without credit 
card info, and free subscription.

rofl. I love that word. "disgruntled", the opposite of which must be 
"gruntled". I dunno... I envision a cute little bear cub with a new 
found honey pot as being 'gruntled'. I hope my postal worker is having a 
similiar day. ;)

Actually the you can even download it without bittorrent, for free, but 
I'm at 4% after 10+ hours give or take. Looks like they're really 
throttling bandwidth on that... which is understandable.

Ah...you are new to bittorrent. Bittorrent is a unique type of p2p 
software. It was designed to allow the distribution of very large files 
efficiently, by having the community that downloads them share them 
simultaneously. Your downloading your copy from users who have 
downloaded theirs, and people are downloading from you the part you have 
already downloaded.

Its becoming commonly used by companies to distribute software as it 
reduces their bandwidth requirements, as its essentially provided by 
people who are downloading the software. The best way to download Linux 
distros (routinely 3+ GB) in particular is via bittorrent.

Of course, it can and is also used to pirate music, movies, and 
software. But its the first p2p software that seems to be gaining 
widespread commercial use for legit purposes in addition to that.

I recommend reading the FAQ & Documentation on BitTorrent. It should 
explain all.

I'm guessing there is a considerable rush on downloads at the moment. On 
the upside I'm showing 31hrs remaining on bittorrent, getting 24kb/s, 
which is rapidly overtaking the download directly from funcom which had 
a 10 hour headstart.

That's if any of them notices us at all in the AO equivalent of the long 
abandoned Qeynos Hills, Nektulos Woods, or Tox Forest. :D
