You might want to think about the Shadowbound quests from Temple of Solusek
Ro they give a nice set of Nec only gear..


Shadowbound Boots
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM
AC: +5 HP: +15 Mana: +15

Shadowbound Gloves
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM
AC: +6 Str: +3 Dex: +3 Int: +3 Mana: +3

Robe of Enshroudment
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM
AC: +9 Agi: +4 Int: +4 Fire Resist: +4 Cold Resist: +4

I got them around level 24 and used them to about 37 level. Thats when I got
my first Shining Metallic Robe.

Dont stess too much on gear, untill I got the shadowbound I was mostly
wearing raw silk and I didnt do too badly )
When you hit your 40s thats when the gear starts to matter a lot <at least
that has been my experience>
As a last suggestion when you do hit 40 make it a point to get Journeymans
Boots, it makes soloing so much easier.

Redwhisper 54 Necromancer
Ayonae Ro Server
Proud member and officer of Soldiers of Valor

Good luck and have fun.
