I've been playing "SOCOM Navy Seals" and I dig it. It's pretty cool
knowing the others guy are seeing the exact same thing, the same way
as you do. Cool thing is even with all the jungle foliage on some
multi player level..No LAG, none, zilch.
I personally am going to go to SWG when it comes out. The only reason
I started to play EQ was to get a handle on how MMORPGs work, and I
guess it didn't really matter since SWG is such a different animal.
But still I got bit by the EQ bug.LOL.And what a bug it was.
