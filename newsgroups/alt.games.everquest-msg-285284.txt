Right after launch, the lag was horrendous (think Antonica in EQ2 at
launch if you played it).  At the mailbox, you would click the piece of
mail, then wait about 1.5 minutes for it to open.  The auction house
was much the same.

At some point though, they got that fixed up, and they also added some
sort of coding that reduced hardware lag in crowded areas as well.  Lag
is not been an issue for me for a LONG time.  The only place you really
see it is in battlegrounds, but that's somewhat to be expected, because
you're dealing with 3 parties (enemy <--> server <--> you).

As far as queues.  If you can't stand queues, don't roll on a high
population server.  It's that easy.  I play on Maelstrom and have never
had a queue, not once.  Before that I was on Alleria, and I never had a
queue.  However, when I went back to visit Alleria a few months ago,
one had crept up.
