How do I use the `modify' option to change the textures when there is NO
`Modify' button on the Options screen?! 

I installed SoL and told it to use some of the next character models, but
they're not showing up. I can see the Van Shir okay, but the other races look
the same as they did before I installed SoL. 

Oh, yeah, I see another patch coming to fix this one....NOT!
