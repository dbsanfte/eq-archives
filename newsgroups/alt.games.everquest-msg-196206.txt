If you can find enough wizards upset that they can't get kei then you may
have a case.  Oh yea, poor wizards get it free.  Do you really, seriously
believe what you just wrote?  I have never ever heard of a player kicked out
of a group for not having kei.  I also have never heard of a group not
inviting someone because he didnt have kei.  You have to have facts not
suppositions.  A lot of times even facts don't do it.
