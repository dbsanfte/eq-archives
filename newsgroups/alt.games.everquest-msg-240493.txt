OK, besides the coffin, what would be normal "fee/charge/tip" that I would
give a Necro?
Besides the region, how exact do I have to be on my corpse's location?

I spent all day yesterday trying to get to my corpse.  I died and looted my
body at least 6 times.  (I still have a body in N. Ro now)

Sorry for all the newbie questions ........... Ben
