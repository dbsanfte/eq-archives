I have to disagree about the Bazaar (although I wouldn't like all
Zones to be as packed).  The framerate is a bit frustrating, but it is
the only zone I have encountered where my low 20s char (my first) has
felt like part of the same world as the higher level characters.  In
the Bazaar you get to experience a bit of their world, instead of
never seeing them at all except in the Nexus as they port in and out. 
You can see all the stuff they sell you can never affford and feel
that if you stick at it you will be up there eventually.  When you are
playing elsewhere you only ever see/interact with people around your
level, which decreases the "real world" feeling of the game.
