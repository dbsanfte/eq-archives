I hadn't noticed this, saw something like it but thought they were 
referring to the vendor machine versus the trader, didn't try the 
faction guys.

To make things more confusing, you're used to putting things on by 
clicking on them, and when you get a message saying that doesn't work, 
you figure its because you aren't qualified to wear the gear.

Actually, putting on an item by clicking only works if the item doesn't 
have a clicky effect, otherwise it tries the effect instead.

You will also find that putting on a second shoulderpad, for example, is 
tough, because by default you'll simply swap the left pad with the one 
you are clicking on, and back and forth, leaving the right pad slot 
empty.  So learning to put items on manually is handy anyway.

Little quibble, do one of the quests, twice.  There are two quests, each 
yeilds one pad, only usable by someone of that faction.  They aren't 
unique (AO equivalent of Lore), so you can wear two the same... but 
doing both quests will give you one you can and one you can't wear. 
They seem to be identical other than their faction requirement.  You can 
do the clan version of the quest at first level with a little luck (the 
rollerrats could be trouble, but the worst that will happen is you die) 
  The Omni version is a little harder as you actually have to kill 
stuff, and that can be difficult at 1st level.

They do give boots.  You can buy chest, boots, pants, two sleeves, 
gloves, plus quest for shoulderpads.  The sleeves won't be wearable till 
7th level though, IIRC.  Whats missing are rings, bracelets, helmet and 
back... you even get a neck item, although it won't be useful till you 
get ten mission tokens on the mainland.

There's a helmet hinted at, by the way, apparantly you can make one from 
a rubbery lump of rollerrat flesh or something, but I can't find a 
recipee for it, and it might not be makeable on the island.

Or you could buy shades :)

What I think is most lacking on the island is ammo and nano 
replenishment kits.
