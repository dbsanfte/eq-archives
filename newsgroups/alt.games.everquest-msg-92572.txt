And because the cheapest spells also tend to cause the least damage, there's
less time you need to bother healing/re-casting your pet.  By the way, you
can also cast the spell on yourself to build up skill.  Definitely less
useful for a necro or mage than may be for a wizzie (which should have
evocation maxed within 10 minutes of the DING anyway), but there you go.
