I play the same way. I have 9 chars, from 13 troll beastlord to 28 half
elf bard. Two chars are guilded -- different guilds of course -- and I've
never really done anything with either guild, for various reasons.

Some suggestions:

1) Make at least one soloing class so if you find yourself groupless, you'll
have at least 1 char to play.

2) Find a friend who has similar play patterns -- times, servers, levelling
speed.  I have a Dark Elf Shadowknight that I only run with my friend's
Iksar Shaman.  Because we both have other characters, it's no big deal to
leave these guys sitting around for long periods of time until we can both
get online together. And since we only play these characters together,
they stay roughly the same level.

3) Find friends who have some alts and partner with whatever characters
they have at the time that are appropriate to your level. A friend of mine
is levelling up a ranger alt. As she does so, she can hunt with my 17
ranger, 21 warrior, 24 chanter, 28 bard. Just because she's going up levels
doesn't mean I have to keep pace with her.

4) Actively look for a guild. Don't wait for an invite. Search the web,
alla's, wherever, to see what guilds are available for the servers you
play on, at the times you play. When you're online, do a /who all Dark
Phoenixes Of Doom (or whatever the guild name is) and go chat them up, see
if they're useful, hit them up for an invite. If they're a lowlevel guild
it shouldn't be a problem that you level slow.
