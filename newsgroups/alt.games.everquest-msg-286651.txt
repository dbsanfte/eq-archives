	People seem to have widely differing opinions...  The necro
pet really isn't much of a tank.  Properly geared and buffed and with
some help from AAs he can be a significant source of DPS, but almost any
dot spell outpaces him 2-3 to one.  He _can_ interrupt casters, though.
And I use him to pull mobs from under water.

	Frankly, I sometimes don't even bother with a pet (if I know 
I'm likely to get adds or have to root a mob, for instance, or if the 
mobs have an AOE like the ones in the sand elf missions).

	If you're in a group situation and you NEED the pet for some
reason summoning haste makes it possible to actually make a new one before
the fight's over...  Last time I cared was an LDON mission I think.
