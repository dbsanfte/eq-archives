I just wanted to say, I really like some of the things in the new patch.

Non-binders getting more bind points in IC and Kael... always a good thing

Light blue /con mobs... gee, how long did it take them to figure this out?
You don't get XP or weapon skill gain from a mob that's green to you...
except sometimes... and there's no way for you to know which of those will
give XP...

Corpses you can't get to are now placed where you can... gee this will save
the GMs HOURS. Myself, I've had 3 corpses that I had to petition about, all
placed somewhere I couldn't get them... WTG.

Crit message now reports amount of damage you actually do... go figure.

Group Target Buffs... VERY nice and I think 95% directed towards Dragon and
the like raids... big time saver.

Cursor can catch falling item... WOOT this is such a pain, cures the common
scam "can I see that "insert giant sized weapon here".

Healing now shows amount healed... well it is nice and very consistent with
the other spells.

Foraging fix... thank god :)
