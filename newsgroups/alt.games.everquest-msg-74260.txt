Actually they got something like that in DAOC. Bows were so lethal in
PVP that they had to nerf them, they still might be too lethal now.
Basically no matter how bad assed you were in daoc a couple few people
with bows could kill you from far away and you'd have zero chance.

You are not thinking of the reverse though. Such characters as the
fellowship have "fairy tale main character protection" around them.
They kill the bad guys in one sword stroke or one arrow blow while the
bad guys are horrible shots. In EQ if WE could kill a creature in one
arrow blow it follows that said creatures could kill us in one arrow
blow ALSO (in fact they'd have to be able to for the sake of balance)

Instead in EQ we get bow disc which actually can be pretty darn good
in some dragon encounters with several rangers. Of course I'm thinking
that your post was a joke.
