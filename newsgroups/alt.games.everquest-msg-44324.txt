Like Lance & Jak said, it depends on if you have an enchanter in your group.
I can't speak for the non-enchanter groups, as my main IS one (level 54).

If you have an enchanter in the group it's the SOLE responsibility of the
healer to keep him alive.  It's the SOLE responsibility of the enchanter to
keep the HEALER alive.  When tanks get involved in caster aggro management
when an enchanter is there, people die much more often as they should.

If you have a wizard or necro in your group (and no enchanter) and they're
over-nuking/dot'ing and constantly pissing off the critter, tell them to
slow down.  If they ignore that advice, LET THEM DIE.  No, seriously!  They
have GOT to learn to let you get hit and a lot of dummies don't learn that
until their ass isn't continually saved.

A good cleric keeps everyone alive.  A GREAT cleric allows a dumb caster or
meleer to die when they continue to do stupid things.  This is as true at
level 14 as it is at 54 (and believe me...there's LOTS of dumb 50+ players
out there that claim not to be e-bay accounts).
