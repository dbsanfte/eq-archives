I was having a conversation in the SK channel on Combine a couple days 
ago, discussing the relative merits of SK/warrior/paladin as group and 
raid tanks and so on.

Out of the blue, one guy asks if I have a knight class character in 
endgame on another server.  I freely admit that not only do I not, that 
I'm talking from the persective of a 65 cleric back when 65 was top 
level, and have no experience with endgame in the past couple years 
whatsoever.  But that since on Combine we're limited to 60 for the next 
couple months, and 65 for quite a while after that, I still think I have 
a fairly good basis for the discussion.

He never says another word in the conversation.

Most people are never going to reach endgame stages, if history is any 
guide.  I'm pretty sure I'm not, the guild I'm in is only just now 
getting to NTOV stuff, and didn't make it into VP at all before Velious 
opened.  Our current plan is to farm NTOV for gear, then move backwards 
to VP, then up to ST... at our current raiding schedule, POP will be 
open before we're done with Velious.

And I've got you guys' brains to pick about stuff I'll probably never 
get around to experiencing.  Is "endgame" really so radically different 
that basic truisms about the various tank classes are going to be 
nonsensical?

Berg, 60 SK, top level, still lowbie
