They will have Ents in it. Without the Ents they would have to mess up the
plot horribly. If they did that, Legolas Aragorn and Glimi wouldnt meet
Merry and Pippin again. Not sure if they cut that part out if they would
even meet Gandalf.

They cant just say they magically got back together and Saurmon was
destoryed can they?
