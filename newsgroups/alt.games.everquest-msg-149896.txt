The way I see it, the game mechanics are (should be) the rules.  If it's
possible in the game, Verant really doesn't have a right to complain.
Granted, I don't play that way and I realize that I would be an arse for
doing so (and, of course, there's that little "I Agree" button).  Still,
making a bunch of "don't do this" rules is no substitute for competent
coding.
