Please tell me that you're making a little joke to amuse us all and point out some
of the problems with the exploit policy. If that story is true, did you *at least*
e-mail somebody higher up to get a judgement call on that GM/Guide's decision?
   And (again, if this is in fact true) for all of you "you know when you're
exploiting, so just don't do it" folks, do you care to make a call on this one?
The heart spiders in Guk are non-KOS, non factional.  I spent three levels there
pulling them to my partner by doing FD pulls and waiting till all but one left.
This was taking advantage of exactly the same mob characteristics that Serge used
in Dalnir on that mob. But rather than an exploit, I was applauded in this very
forum for learning good pulling techniques.
   How are we to know that one is and one is not an exploit in this case? I tell
you, this whole thing makes me *very* uneasy, and far more so when VI starts
showing a propensity to quickly pull out the suspend/ban/guilddelete stick on them
at the higher levels of the game.
  How hard would it be to just publish a list of exploits on their web sites, as
they are identified, so people *know* not to do it, then promptly get on with
fixing the code so it can't be exploited. Serg's technique sound like sound monk
tactics to me. And yet he has a warning on his record. Very unsettling.
