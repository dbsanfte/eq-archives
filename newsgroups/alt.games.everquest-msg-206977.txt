I thought it was because they were just being snotty, as well as not
wanting to divulge information that might lead other, lesser guilds to
compete with them on easy mobs that they farm regularly.

I certainly can't imagine that paternalistic attitude coming from
anyone in my server's higher level guilds.  I'd be more inclined to
believe it if you said they didn't mention anything just so they can
continue to tell you how much you suck.
