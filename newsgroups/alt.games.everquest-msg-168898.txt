I don't care if you have more of a "life" than me or how many years you've
played... my point is you made very specific claims about "the high end"
gane... yet your not in the high end game, so your clearly not speaking from
experience.

Your not speaking from experience..  so on what basis did you make those
initial claims?

I didn't question whether your right or not (which in my experiences you
are, actually...) just on what basis your claims were made on
