Okay, what's everyone's opinion on this..

The swear filter is ON by default.  The only way a person can hear any
of the swear without them being garbled is to turn it off.  This is an
act of free will.

So why do people get mad when people swear? They can just as easily
turn it off to avoid it if they want to, problem solved.  

I don't swear in game in shouts or in any messages, I was just curious
as to why everyone felt that way when there's an easy interjection
that's even on by default.
