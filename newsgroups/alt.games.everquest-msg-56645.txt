I picked up a copy today at my local Wal-Mart to keep me up during my
graveyard shift and as I read the wrapping's banner it says: Free EverQuest
CD inside! I was surprised but indeed it is true. All December 2001 issues
of Computer Gaming Monthly have a free FULL VERSION of the original
EverQuest inside and 10 day trial. I think it's pretty cool for whoever
wants to try out the game, or maybe even buy a couple of magazines and discs
and for 10 days have an extra account to exchange with and all sorts of
stuff.
