The difference is that in the second case, you can wait with checking
the exact details until you're really stuck, while in the first you
know from the beginning.  For me, this takes away some of the fun of
exploring, which is why I've pretty much never used any third-party
sites for EQ2 quests, except for ones that are bugged.  An example is
Cleansing the Corruption in Stormhold, which requires me to kill two
defiled squalls, but the squalls are bugged and seem to get stuck
where they can't be reached, which I didn't know until I checked it
outside the game.  Maybe later on I'll need to, but I hope not.
