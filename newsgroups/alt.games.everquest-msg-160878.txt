 Sometimes. Not in the Wastelands usually. The skellies come to mind.
Usually get 2-3 at once. There are also clumps of worms where you get
2-3. There is also a couple spots where you have to split frogs. I used
to pull two and we'd root the adds, but that doesn't work anymore.

 Well.. I disagree. To me our clerics seem to get wailed on much more
than previously. Obviously that's a function of the increased toughness
of the mobs causing the clerics to have to throw heals faster. PoP heal
aggro reminds me of Cazic Thule rings events which are harsh on healers.
