Because if you are refering to text in the previous reply the reader
must scroll down to see what the hell you are talking about and then
scroll back up again. Bottom posting is easier to read not top posting.

Which is fine if you already know the context. The propagation of
the newsfeed sometimes send posts out of order and no previous
message has been read by the reader.
