I've found that STR and STA are both extemely easy stats to raise for
a warrior. 

So I don't think STA loss will be much of an issue for him, even if
he's not playing a twink. Personally I think I would have chosen DEX
and AGI, as it seems all my weapons have STR and STA bonuses but the
DEX/AGI weaps are fairly uncommon, relatively speaking.
