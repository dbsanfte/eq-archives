I've often wondered about that.  It seems to me that this is what you'd want
from a zone to start your Planes raid from:

1. Both Wizards and Druids can port to it.

2. Safe for 46+ players, even if naked.

3. Not unduly far from banking, for both good and evil players.

4. Not too out of the way, so that people without ports can reasonably get
to it.

5. Not too crowded, so that if you use /ooc or /shout when organizing the
raid, that isn't lost in the general chatter of the zone.  (Now that there
are channels, this isn't that important).

For #1, pre-Kunark, the following zones come to mind: WC, NK, SRo, Tox.

There are guards occasionally near the NK Wizard spires.  I don't recall
what level they are, but perhaps that eliminates NK on point #2.

They all kind of suck on #3.

Tox and NK suck on #4.

#5 eliminates WC.

So, SRo makes sense, and Tox sort of does, except for it being a pain to get
to if you don't have a port.  A plus for Tox is that the reagent needed for
the ports is sold in Erudin.

Another advantage of SRo is that you can pass the time waiting for the raid
to start trying out your favorite AC theory. :-)
