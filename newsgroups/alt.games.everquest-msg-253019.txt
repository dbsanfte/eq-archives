My alts are in a family guild and my main in a raiding guild. The family
guild is far more my 'home', and I've known its members longer. I play
my alts with the family guild and my main helps them on raids and such,
but yeah, they know my 'raid guild' commitments mean I cant always
be there. It works well , but I dont abuse their hospitality or undermine
their guild. Its a net gain for us both; We all get to keep in touch
with one another ,company we like, they get the 'power boost' of my
time and god gear when they need it (although, to be honest, I think
they prefer my roleplay and stupidity more), and I get to keep a bit
of the EQ I love going.

It can work fine - I dont think that changing that open friendly nature
of a family guild because of a bad apple, starting to demand 100% 
unqualified commitment is a solution. Its just fighting fire with
fire, and the point of family guilds is rather that they're not fire,
but something more gentle and comfortable altogether... no?

Yeah. Agreed.
