Hmmn - I don't actually play games for the challenge of it, just as a
relaxing way of passing time. Even if I am playing single player games I
will normally keep the difficulty low so I can just meander along at my own
pace and generally goof around. Depending on how you play EQ - it can
definately cause stress, especially if you push yourself past exhaustion or
have a day of raid wipeouts. Of course the more competetive your play style
the more stress becomes involved. This is pretty low level stress mind you -
but still it is more than a than sitting on a deck chair with tequila in
hand.

Thanks for the info on the level break points btw - will keep that in mind
when I pick up LDoN. No hurry though - I still have PoP and LoY to catch up
on yet ; )
