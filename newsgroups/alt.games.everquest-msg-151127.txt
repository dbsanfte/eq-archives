| I liked the old particles.  They had heavy use of anti-aliasing and
| transparency.  The new ones look like a cartoon drawing.  Very out of
| context in this game.  I don't like them - except for the new ice
| comet.  All I could say when I first saw it was WOW!  It's like an
| actual comet that comes out of the sky and hits the target, with a
| cloud of dust spreading out after it lands.
