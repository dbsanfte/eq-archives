I downloaded the 3rd-party drivers for my Voodoo 5500 card from Verant's
website under "supported video cards", followed their upgrade info to
the letter (DX8.1 -> vid card drivers -> sound card drivers), was able
to install SoL and then patch with nary a problem (except for the patch
taking forever).  The graphics in-game look fine (although everything
takes forever to load), BUT everything is dog-slow now.  Mostly it seems
to be when there are more than 5-6 character models in view (far, far
worse than the lag-trees of Kunark ever were).  Fiddling around with
graphics options doesn't seem to solve anything.  There is *some*
framerate gain when dropping resolution.  No gain from dropping dynamic
lighting or SoL models from what I could tell.  Ditto with the clipping
plane.  Are there any Voodoo users out there that are happy with their
setup (i.e. 20-30 frames a sec, I'd consider acceptable)?  If so, please
tell me what you're doing (drivers, etc.).  I'd prefer to hold on to
this card as long as possible before tossing it.  Currently the game is
unplayable until I can figure out how to make the framerates better.


*sigh*,
