Note: I don't play a wizard, in fact, I don't play any int casters.
I thought I'd throw in a few comments anyway.

I really likes this one, fits right in with my idea of a wiz.

Ditto.

I think it would be great to give wizzies some better crowd
control abilities, yes.

The tank aggro thing would make this too powerful IMO, otherwise a
good idea.

Agreed. CoTH is a wizard spell, should never have been given to
mages.

Hehe, cast radiation on self in newbie zone; run for guard; instant
wizard pate!

These wouldn't be needed with the mastery spells below.

Mod rods for wizards?

These should be high level spells (50+)

Sounds like a chanter job to me. GoM does exactly that, and belongs
with the chanters.

Wizards are, in my eyes, the kings of teleportation, so this makes
sense to me

Now this certainly fits right into my idea of a wizard. Should be a
progressive spell line:

14: Shows Hit Points
24: Shows HP, Mana
39: Shows HP, Mana, Resists
etc, etc...

Way too powerful, IMO.

This would be a mage spell IMO, summoning from another plane and all
that. Still, reminds me of a line from the AD&D Famous Last Words
file:

Wizard: What is this scroll, it just says HASTUR HASTUR HASTURAAARGH!

Or something like that anyway =)

Sounds cool. Draining mana from an NPC cleric sure is something I'd
like, nothing I hate more than seeing "MOB looks completely healed."

These should have a higher chance of resisting than the equivalent
spells, if they were ever implemented.

Yup, the problem with wizards are that they bring very little to the
average group, and are seen as little more than exp sponges right
now. All of these spells would obviously be too much, but wizards
sure need SOMETHING to make them more attractive to your everyday
pickup group.

Rune, who's planning to start a wizzie RSN.
