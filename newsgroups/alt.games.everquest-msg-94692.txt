If you are really looking forward to including a boat in
your travels (to make it more realistic/adventuresome than
just porting, I'd guess), you can do this:

Get a port to Odus (the Erudite continent).  I'm not sure
what your faction level with the Erudites will be, but 
probably not KoS.

Then, ride the boat from Erudin to Qeynos.
