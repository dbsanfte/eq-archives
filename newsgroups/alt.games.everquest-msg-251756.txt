I don't know about you, but I cannot afford a SGI anything. But I've
never considered their computers to be PCs, they are workstations. A
big difference.

Hmm. I did a search Saturday night, using dogpile.com and the phrase
'Cray teraflops'. Without the single quote marks.

I found pages of hits. I read some of them. Crays are being built
with teraflop capability, the announcements are from 2003 and
earlier.

No PC I know of runs that fast. Do you have an example ?

I've seen a SGI violet, no way is it a PC, high end or otherwise.

A Mac is about the same speed class as an Intel box. Of course an
emulator is going to run slow on it.

I ran cross-dos on my Amiga A3000. Yeah, it ran slow.

Wanna bet ?

But I'll bet it could be done. Anbd as I point out above, teraflop
Crays is something out there.
