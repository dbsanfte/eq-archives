No.  Sometimes you won't take a faction hit even if you -do- help, but 
don't hit the mob directly.  The key is getting on the mob's hate list 
before it dies.  Some of the 'spell on group' or healing situations only 
have a random chance of adding you to the hatelist, so you may not always 
get the hit.  To be sure, tag the mob.

>get XP?

Yes, provided you're in range, and the person who pulled the mob is in 
range, and the mob isn't green to you, and the highest level member of 
the group is less than half again your level (or less than 5 levels 
higher below level 10).
