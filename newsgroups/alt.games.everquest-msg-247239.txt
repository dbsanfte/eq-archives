So your choosing to step on the people who aren't interested in CoH. :)

Then the logical step would be to invite everyone interested in CoH here 
to csipg.rpg and resume posting there. :) This *isn't* a coh group... 
and while everyone is being very tolerant of the groups regulars 
(because they aren't random spammers) interest in coh here, even if they 
aren't interested themselves, its still improper netiquette to continue 
posting thread after thread of CoH here.

It really should move to its own home or at least move out of this one.
