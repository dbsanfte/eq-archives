 While not agreeing with Faned on everything I will agree here on
principle. I seriously doubt even with the use of ShowEQ you'll know
when a mob is "about to spawn". It's either up or it's not. Could Verant
have an invisible trigger that appears before RF spawns? Sure, but why
bother? Why not just spawn RF directly. While she may feel it was
ShowEQers who foiled their attempts at getting Ragefire I'd say she's
just being excessively paranoid.
