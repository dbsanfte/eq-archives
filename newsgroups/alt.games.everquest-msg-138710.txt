}downloaded the lasted, 8.1, and after installation and rebooting I tried to
}run EQ but it said I had no known 3D Device. I e-mail the EverQuest tech
}support and they told me to run the 2 tests for DirectX I did and the
}direct3d test failed so they told me to download all of my updates for
}DirectX and for the my video and sound cards, I did but the game still says
}I have no 3D device, what do I do? Please help, I really want to play this
}game again. =(

There s a bug in DX8.1.  It frequently reports Direct3D as being turnedon 
when it is not actually on.  So go into dxdiags, disable it, and re-enable 
it.
