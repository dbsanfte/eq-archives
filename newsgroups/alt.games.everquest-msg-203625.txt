I'm not convinced that this would make a whole lot of difference really.

If a level 1 char has access to 10kpp then the chances are that they can 
get PLed to 25 quite trivially. (I guess the only exception being a single 
box soloer with no friends :-/)

If they made if free then it would cause more problems (IMO) since then 
people without :

a) experiecne
b) fiends in game / guild

would be skipping levels. (Sure tose 2 are not the best indicator of skills 
but they are the only ones that seem to apply)

(Note that E-Bayers could just by the plat, but then nothing stops them 
buying a char ready made :-/)

So I guess the balancing factor would be how much it cost. Too little and 
it create more "clueless" high(er) level players that PLing already does.

just my 0.2
