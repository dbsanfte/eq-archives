    The only problem is - at one point, trust is going to -have- to be
extended by one person...  I've been burned before by accepting payment
after the port (that Iksar guy who just took off -after- porting him to BB,
and escorting him to Gfay)...  After guys like that, I'm more inclined to
accept payment before porting...
