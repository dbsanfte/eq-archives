And I'd love to hear the truth. Not some snide little fellow trying to
justify whatever insignificant country he resides in's greatness. Face
it, Socialism is a disease for the uninspired. It's planned
mediocrity. And you've bought into it hook, line, and sinker. And for
the record, no, I'm not a "rightist." I believe that the republicrats
are trying to do to us exactly what the EU's leaders have done to the
Euros. And I disapprove. Strongly. And unless you can do something
other than mouth insults and bullshit, we don't have anything else to
talk about. 

And again, I decided not to plonk you. Not worth the space in my
killfile.
