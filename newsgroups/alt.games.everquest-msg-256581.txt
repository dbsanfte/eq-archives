I believe Saryn's Scream something (lvl61 if my memory serves me right) has a stun
component. And there is the Boastful bellow AA. Should have a stun
component too. Since I did not have this AA back when I was actively
playing and Saryn's scream is situational at best I used mezz alot. It
doesn't use mana and casts in 3 seconds. And it doesn't generate much
aggro. Last but not least the 65 Mezz makes mobs dance. If those mobs
have a dance animation. :D
