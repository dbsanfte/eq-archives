Never underestimate the royal pain that is Xalgoz.  Bastard took me 6 hours
to get my fang, and I almost died from falling asleep 3 times while pulling
the church to keep it clear.  Plus at the end it was the last spawn we were
going to do (was duoing with 52 mage, I was 47) and 8 people showed up
looking for him, we ended up moving inside the church so we could get the
kill, bloody annoying.  At least the Chancellor was more of a "show up and
check track" kind of spawn.

Seb key's a snooze though, I've given away sets of medallions just while
doing the H/F cycles. (always pull H/F to EJ zone so people might loot it,
but the rares I kill off in the jungle to minimize KS, only seen Doom and
the big chicken that only drops spells though, there's 3 hunters and 4
foragers up though until tonights patch)
