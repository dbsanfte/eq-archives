There are a couple of nice options for getting back to Halas without waiting
for daylight.

1) Easiest : Get a port from a druid or wizzie friend.
2) Harder but fun : Take the raft from Oasis into Timorous Deep, then swim south to the firepot
    room underwater at the sunken spires.  (check out www.eqatlas.com)
    It's a long swim, but it will up your swimming skill!  Then click on one of the objects in the
    room to teleport to Halas.  You'll have to find out which object from eqatlas,
    as they have a listing of which object takes you where.  Make sure to keep an eye out
    for faydedar the level 51 dragon which has been sighted near the sunken spires.  If he's
    up, stay away.
