Amulet of Necropotence gives an all/all skellie form, drops your HP 100
points and raises some stat like AC or something.  Its droppable, which
means I've seen it handed around whole raids as a lark.

There's some Wood Elf illusion thing, no drop, that requires a metric
buttload of faction farming in Guk and so forth

There's a halfling illusion mask you can get in Neriak, you need to have
good faction and hand in Master Whoopal's head, its one charge though.

There's the Mask of the Deciever, which is perhaps what you are talking
about, the early version of which could be clicked from inventory to give
illusion DE.  No Drop and no longer drops in this form, the new one works
only when equipped and is rogue/bard only.  I wonder, though, if Firiona
Vie server was active long enough ago that there's a droppable version of
the early mask...

And then there are potions, seems to be a potion for every player race,
come in one charge, five charge, ten charge bottles.  They are all/all,
pretty cheap if you need the faction for some purpose or other, and are
even droppable, if you want to hand a ten slot bottle around the group...

Thats all that comes to mind, could easily be more I'm not thinking of or
aware of, especially the single charge stuff like that halfling mask
which is pretty obscure.

Matte, 30 chanter, Morel-Thule
oh, and then you could always get a high end chanter who can cast
illusions on others, he's not exactly an item, but gets the job done
regardless of your class and race...
