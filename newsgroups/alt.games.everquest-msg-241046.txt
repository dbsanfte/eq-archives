Hello- I have a lvl 14 shaman on Brell Serilis and I need some help.

I see a lot of people -most- are in guilds.  I'm going more to the
point where I need to group and I would like to join a guild.

My question is how? 

I don't want to run up to a stranger and invite myself- but I don't
know how to connect with a guild-
Any suggestions- how did you find your guild

Also on the bazaar.  
1) will my trader stay there even when I log off
2) do I need to have food and drink when in trader mode?

Thank in advance for any help
