For the most part I agree with your sentiment, but to think that they'll
"never be in a big guild again" is just silly.  Number one guild on my
server has several "problem" people, number two guild has a couple, and the
number three guild (just took RZ) is widely looked at by members of the
number one and two guilds as being full of "problem" people.  :)

Reputation doesn't mean nearly as much as it used to.
