You're a halfling druid.  ;)  Seriously though, I have noticed that
pick-up groups really, really drop off once you hit the 30s.  There
are still places where it happens, of course, but there's more
competition for less groups (how that works, I really dunno, but I've
sat in DSP shouting for a group often enough to know it happens).  On
the plus side, you can, at least, go solo if a group doesn't show up.
Try hitting /lfg on btw - once in awhile if my rogue is grouped and
we're needing members I'll do a /who all 35 40 lfg to see who's
around, and if you're soloing in DSP or something, you might just get
a tell asking if you're interested.

I partner my necro up with a guildie druid quite often, and we have a
lot of fun.  I think the mob usually has at least half a dozen dots
slammed on him right away :)  The only thing I dislike is that my
snare-with-dot won't overwrite his snare-without-dot.  And the places
we usually hunt, I don't like pulling in case something happens and my
pet decides to go rampaging into the middle of a dozen of whatever
we're pulling to personally tell off the one that hit me once ;p
