The ability to run two instances of eq certainly is borked for me.  I was
able to do it normally, although I had some video lag in the 2nd instance
that isn't normally there, but when I tried to log off the first instance
both stopped responding.  Trying to end the program from the task manager
proved futile and I ended up having to do a hard reboot :-\
