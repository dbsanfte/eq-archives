PvP is Player Versus Player. That's it. No other definition need apply.

That you are restricted from killing SOME people changes nothing about the
fact that your ability to kill others is unrestricted.

A level 50 Thane cannot kill a level 20 Shaman. Fine.

100 level 50 Thanes *can* kill one level 5 minstrel. Is that fun...for
either side? I dearly hope you cannot answer that question with a yes.
