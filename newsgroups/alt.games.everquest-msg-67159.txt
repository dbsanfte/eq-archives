In your fifties, like it or not, you could really use to get into a
guild. As a 53 Champion it shouldn't be hard to do that at all, unless
you've totally trashed your reputation on the server or something. Even
if you only play a short amount of time a week, if you can look out for
people in a higher level guild with the /who all command and try to
group with them a few times, you can likely get an invite if you are a
good player and a decent person.

To upgrade your armor significantly, you're likely going to want to go
to Hate and/or Vellious quest armor. You're not getting any of that on
your own, and your odds of getting in pickup groups/raids to obtain such
stuff are pretty abysmal. I'm two levels behind you, and still in mostly
crafted myself. We're only just now getting any drops from Arena raids
in Kael. You've crossed the line beyond which getting significant
upgrades alone or in pick-up groups is going to be very difficult. Try
to get into a good support network to help you, and to let you help
them.
Good luck.
