Always report the problem to your boss as a UBD error.  In the long run,
eventually your boss will understand that your are not wasting your time all
day and will help you avoid this type of problem in the future.  Usually by
talking to your client's boss to get the client some assistance and cutting
down on this type of problem for you.

If your boss can't or won't make the call, at least they will stop adding to
your problems or risk being labeled as a UBD error themselves.  If not,
there are always other places to work.
