Hmm, if that's the hole you fall into in N Ro, I resembled that
remark! 

From what little I've seen (3-3 at 65 so far in LDoN), you need a
combination of 3 tanks/DPS classes to do well in LDoN. if you can
off-tank adds, you don't have to spend time trying to split and can
make up for low DPS through pull efficiency. 

Normal mode in LDoN seems pretty balanced for a group of 65 with
around 30AAs and bazaar gear. You don't always win but pretty much any
class combinations will give you a decent shot at it. Move that up to
a group with 100+ AAs and normal mode becomes pretty trivial. 

I must admit, I've sold out! LDoN will actively get me looking for KEI
on my shaman before adventuring, something I've never done before.
