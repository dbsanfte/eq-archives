If it's a damage bonus, the formula for the mode would be (2*16)+[0-5], and
you would see peaks at 32 through 37.  If it adds straight to the base
damage, the formula is 2*(16+[0-5]), and the peaks are at 32, 34, 36, 38,
40 and 42

Now see for yourself, which one does this graph look like?

That's something like 2000 hits with a LSoEE in my offhand.  For
comparison, here's my mainhand over the same period.  This is what a
(2*x)+y mode looks like, in this case the y is my natural damage bonus
rather than the weapon's.
