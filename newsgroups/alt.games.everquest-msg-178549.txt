Cut and dry, best option is the Goblin Gazhugi ring off the Sarnak Courier
in LOIO. The Sarnak Courier is a relatively rare spawn best found around the
ruins area near the mill. I've heard of people killing him 35 times and not
getting the ring. I think I got it on the 2nd or 3rd time I dropped him, but
it took me a few hours of camping him to get him to pop that many times.

Why do I think this is cut and dry? Well, not only is it a great light
source, but it has insta-cast Invis to Animals, and any inst-cast invis is
VERY nice to have as a bard to break charm at will - indeed, it's simply a
must if you want to swarm kite at all. All that, and it's one of the best
light sources in the game.
