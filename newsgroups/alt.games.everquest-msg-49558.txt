Well glad to see that it is fixed. I'm also glad that adding a page to
favorites is also a confirm option (not really confirm but asks you which
folder you want it in, and you can just cancel it if you want). Now I'm just
waiting for the set as home page to be confirm too. TOO MANY times have I
been looking for one thing, stumbled onto a porn site (one of those which
appears in the search, claiming to have what ever your search words were,
even if not anywhere close to porn related, and claiming to be titled what
word(s) you searched, or even just misleading links), and only to open my
browser later to go back to that porn site because its my home page, and in
trying to close the site get flooded with pop-up windows some asking which
favorites folder I'd like the site in. Hopefully a new (soon) version of
Internet Explorer will have options to disable those "features". Sometimes
you wonder if the people in charge of writing the original code for Java or
JavaScript are advertisers for porn sites, seeing how even the most innocent
of commands becomes a way to force you into the site.
    I even knew someone at work who had that happen when looking for
technical info on a computer problem a customer was having. And at work, on
a network that IS likely being monitored is not a good time to be
misdirected and have your browser's home page changed without your knowing.
