As a halfling, you have a good head-start on this: sneak.

You can hand greater lightstones in to one of the dark elf merchants in
South Ro, for the usual Concordance reward.  Normally, you won't have
the faction for this, but sneak up behind her and con her - once she's
indifferent, she'll accept the stones, and give you positive faction
with DreadGuardOuter, DreadGuardInner and DarkBargainers, with no
negative faction hits.

Not sure how many GLS you'd need to hand in (I've heard it's in the
region of 100 - 150 to go from scowls to dubious, but that could be
totally wrong).  I think that's the only way to raise Neriak faction
without screwing your hometown faction (by killing the halflings in
Nektulos).

Once your non-KOS to the guards, it should be possible to do the red
wine quest to further raise DarkBargainer faction, with care.
IndigoBrotherhood is tougher, so it may be best just to avoid the
warrior guild.  And I've no idea about the other Neriak factions
(clerics, necro/SK, casters...) so tread carefully.
