Then again... EQ1 is a piece of crap code-wise at this point, so 
patching and maintenance could cost more per fix than a fresh codebase.

More importantly: nothing they do makes sense anymore...un-named frogs 
that are tougher than dragons & gods... newbie expansion common drops 
that outclass old dragon loot...

EQ1 has evolved and they have upgraded the engine and the mechanics and 
the interface... but they haven't made a coherent title from a world 
perspective anymore... it is the most illogical game to actually play. 
The only way to make your way through everquest is to rely on websites 
and longtime players....

A fresh start even in EQ1's world+mechanics but with *rewritten* (not 
just "additional") content and all new level 1 characters would be an 
exciting day from my perspective. To me that is the potential promise of 
EQ2... and a good reason to release an EQ2 instead of NewTitle1.
