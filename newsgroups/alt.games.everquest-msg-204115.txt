Well, if nobody's dying, then there's no real risk of death.

Which, more likely, has nothing to do with the new group xp rules, and
everything to do preexisting problems in level design and difficulty
progression. For example, it's not unusual to find the stage area in
splitpaw camped by level 33-38 folks -- although an average group of level
30s can easily handle it too -- long after xp has started nosediving.
The reason is that going beyond the double doors you run into significant
numbers of casters tossing around 200pt nukes. You need good healing,
good crowd control, and good anti-caster abilities in your group to even
consider progressing in the dungeon. If your pickup group meets those
criteria you're way better off going in deeper. If it doesn't, the sucky
xp at the stage is much better than losing xp hand over fist because
you're dying.

"Yeah, I know we moved from Camp A to Camp B because A's xp was suxx0r and
B's xp was r0ckn. But because of the new group xp rules, I think we should
head back to A and get twice the suxx0r xp instead of staying here and
getting twice the r0ckn xp!" "D3wd, I'm so there!"

I guess there are morons like that in the game: you seem to have run
into them. But the morons are only penalizing themselves for slumming.
I just don't see anything worth whining about.
