I greatly doubt the number of accounts per person is nearly as high as
you claim.  My guild is pretty high-level, and we have several folks
who have more than one account.  I strongly doubt we have more than 1
extra account for every 5 main accounts though.  That includes port
mules, gem mules, rez mules, etc.
