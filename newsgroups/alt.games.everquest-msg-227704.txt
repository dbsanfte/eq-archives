I've done this twice, once about a decade ago and once a couple of years
ago. It's absolutely doable, don't need any special knowledge or tools
anymore really, and it is sort of interesting to do at least once. I will,
however, never do it again. It stopped making any financial sense years ago,
and is pretty silly from a warranty/service point of view too. The only
value I'd see it in now is the learning curve that then leaves you able to
replace individual components of a PC as need be (upgrade a video card, swap
out a dead hard drive, etc.), that's a useful capability now and then.
