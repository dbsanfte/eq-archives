A few things I would like to see...

I would like to see the graphics for the Bard Instruments fixed... game over
2 years old... it would be about time.

I would like to be able to climb a ladder reliably over 1 mph... Why can we
dual wield, double and triple hit, etc but can't stay on a ladder with over
150 Dex or Agility?  It would be nice if it was a hell of a lot more
difficult to fall off of ladders.  Anyone ever try to climb to safety from
the crocs at the underground ledge in Cazic Thule? Not happening...
