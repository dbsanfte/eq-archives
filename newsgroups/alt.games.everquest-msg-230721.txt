: Hi.
:
: I've been playing Diablo for a long time, never got Everquest because
: i was on dial up, and, i was under the impression Everquest was played
: completely online.
:
: Is this true?

Yes, entirely online.  Dial up works well, unless you have only one phone
line or someone picks up the phone while you are online.

:
: anyway, just got DSL and would like to investigate Everquest. What
: version should i start with? There seems to be so many. If I buy an
: older version, perhaps on Ebay, can i update it online, as i did with
: Neverwinter Nights?

Buy the game.  Install it.  Then get upgraded automatically to the latest
version via the patch routine.  Do not buy from Ebay.  here is an account
key that can only be used by one person, so the discs from Ebay will likely
be nothing more than expesive drink coasters.

:
: Also, what character is sort of regarded as the easiest one to start
: wiht, to get to know the game?

IMO, any melee (warrior, ranger, paladin, shadow knight or monk).  My choice
wourl be SK or Ranger, now.

:
: Any real pitfalls to avoid?
:

Don't give up.  Never give up.  After that, don't beg.  Then don't whine
about how everyone else has an easier character class than you.


: thank you.
:

You're welcome.
