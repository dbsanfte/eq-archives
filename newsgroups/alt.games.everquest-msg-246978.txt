A lot of the data that the full GM issues require is kept server-side.
The outsourced offices, I wager, only receive that data through an
intra-net of sorts rather than sending it over non-secure channels on
the internet. There's a lot of data there that they don't want out of
their sight, so to speak.

Also, with the authority and abilities GMs have, they want to keep
them under the watchful eyes of supervisors. They can't do that with
work at homes.
