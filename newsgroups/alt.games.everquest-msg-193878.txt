i started my first beast lordon the fv server. im level 11 what im wondering
is...i can hit willow wisps with my weapon and just bought some magic boots
to kick them also. but my pet cant hit them. my silly question is this, if i
give my pet a magic weapon will it allow him to hit willow wisps? i know he
wouldnt show up as holding the weapon but was hoping maybe he would get the
effect.

thanks much in advance
michial
