  I hear the monster missions are due to be nerfed again this week.
Apparnetly, they weren't wrecked badly enough last time: people
are still willing to play them.
  Trying to take advantage of the situation while it persists, I
dedicated this past weekend to trying the missions. My impressions:
  I like the orc mission. Straightforward grouping - one cleric for
heals, one wizard for mana regen on the cleric, four tanks. Move
as a group, handle up to five mobs at a time with Vrodak in tow;
5-on-6 or 5-on-7 is very doable. I'd like the rare drop augment
from this someday.
  I like the idea of the fairy mission; hate the way most people
want to do it. Everyone wants to split the group up and dot
the shrines down, the theory being the mission can be done
fastest that way - if you get no adds while maintaining the dots
on the shrines. Which almost never happens; adds are inevitable.
SOE has done a good job trying to compel players to keep the
group together and spend time killing mobs; players are not doing
much of a job at all favoring this strategy. The missions end up
taking just as long or longer the way THEY want to do them, and
are often cancelled. I won't do anymore of these, now that I have
the standard neck item from them - a signifigant upgrade for Adas;
her Iron Amulet of Unseen Horrors was one of her weakest pieces
remaining.
  Not doing any more Naggy missions, either. First two tries the
tanks couldn't keep the invaders off the clerics, and your dead repop
all the way over in the king room - and youy're too tall for the arches
in the corridors. The /duck command seemed to be broken, too,
resulting in me disbanding from the group accidentally a couple of times.
Third try, we made it past the first wave OK. Second wave, concentrated
on the invading chanters, got them down, the rest died easy. Third wave,
same as the first, down OK. Fourth, we lsot; we missed a chanter, I got
charmed, and without my heals Naggy died again. Are the preists really
charmable by level 52 chanters? Has that ever helped in real Naggy
raids? At least the invaders were funny:
  An invading rogue's corpse says "What's evade?"
  An invading monk's corpse is afk.
  An invading paladin's corpse says "Martyrdom, here I come!"
  An invading enchanter's corpse says "Tashed!"
  An invading warrior's corpse says "Next time let me hold agro!"

  The griffin mission has more of this. Apparently, the East Commons
instance is modelled on the old pre-Luclin state of the zone, though one
of the NPC's there is a Vah Shir. It was reasonably diverting; I should
bring my melees through it for the arm drops.

  Saviours, meanwhile, is starting to move into RSS. We would love
to catch Chailak or Feratha up, but for now we will settle for camping
statue, RS, or stairs in raid strength. Adas even got an RS group for a
few hours, with some very uber poeple, pulling two at a time fearlessly;
I earned back all the regular xp lost in several weeks of raid deaths,
and several extra AA's besides. Plus Adas got her second level 70
spell, Telekara, modest damage but with an 8 second stun.
Just getting regular RSS groups, however, will solve many problems,
for Adas and for Saviours.
