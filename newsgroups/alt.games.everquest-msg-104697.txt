While we're at it, I think Paladins should be able to dual wield.  Would
that really unbalance the class all that much?  Oooh, and change our epics
from 2HS to 1HS!  Would my Tunare-loving paladin really be all that powerful
wielding Firey Defender and Nature Defender?  I mean, they'd have the 1HS
damage bonus to make up for it.  Oh yeah, and let us be agnostic, so we
won't have to deal with those pesky faction issues.  Also, a snare would be
nice for fear kiting undead.  All that's left is to make the holy steed a
level 1 ability like LoH, and I'll be happy.
