I thought this only applied to spells which last at least 30 seconds?
Since SE normally lasts 28 seconds, this would rule out the 42 second 3K
SE.  I'd be more than happy to hear that I'm wrong about this, of course,
SE is a very functional spell strategy at the beginning of PoP encounters,
making the impossible possible while waiting for a slow to land and
allowing very low aggro healing.  Only complaint is it costs the same as
CHeal, but the average Cheal lands for at least 3K hp.  3K SE would be a
much happier thing.
