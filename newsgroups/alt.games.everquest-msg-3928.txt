Question: What server do you play on?

I play on ECI and during peak times EVERYTHING has a name in both 
these zones.  Lake of Ill was ok during the first few months but now 
its Oasis2.  Yes it is possible to find mobs.  This person is L16 (if 
I remember correctly)  That limits what they can really solo in Ill 
Omen quite a bit and even groupwise they are limited.  In Oasis there 
is more for them to pick from but they'll be picking from the same 
choices that the vast majority of people fighting there are looking.
