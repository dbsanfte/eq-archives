The card is not DX9 compatible no doubt about that ... my understanding
was though that you would miss out on all the the DX9 goodies like new
textures etc and would revert to a lower standard of graphics ..
perhaps I am wrong here.

The EQ Support site still lists your card as supported but they may not
have updated it.

Do you get to the options screen at all?  If so check what card is
listed in there.  Report back.
