Ah, but the dungeon zones you mentioned dont' appear to be "low blue"
according to the beastiary. Don't get me wrong.. I *LOVE* dungeons and
will always prefer them to outdoor zones. Problem is, we arrived at the
48/49 stage and I was just unable to find a zone where it wasn't either
mostly green, or kicking our asses. That's when we wound up in EJ and it
solved the problem. Now that the cleric has made 49, we started working
on our Seb keys last night, and thats' where we're going next.

You're preaching to the choir here. We spent about half of our time for
many levels fighting as a warrior/cleric duo. The rest as a three person
group with our friend Orlun the rogue thrown in. There isn't a lot you
can't do with that threesome. Plus, if we *really* feel we need extras
for a particular spot/mob, the old shout of "/shout Warrior, Cleric,
Rogue, looking for more" will usually grab the instant interest of any
solo/lfg folks in zone. As to your chickenliver comment, the last time I
spent any significant time in an outdoor zone before EJ was at level 30
in the Overthere, which I hated. I solo'd all of level 35 in Najena on
the GB quest skellies, just to prove it could be done. We also spent
time leveling in Dalnir, CC, ToFS, and then CoM.  I find both the
leveling and the loot faster and better in dungeons. But at 48, some of
the ones you listed still looked too high level to me and others are a
crowded PITA to get a spot to hunt in. We'll be going to them soon
enough. Personally I think of The Hole, HS, Velks, and Seb as 50+ zones.

> Everybody is crammed into Velketors Labyrinth these days. 

That scares me. I really want to hunt in that zone.

> SolB can sometimes be a little crowded. 

That's like saying that Angelina Jolie is "mildly attractive". <g> At
least on our server. We went in during *off hours* and the place was
evercamped.

> Guk Liveside has always been empty, Sebilis rarely has more than 30 people,

Never tried Lower Guk at all. Probably should have. Seb is 50+ in my
book and I'm told pretty crowded, but I'll try anyway.

> HS has never ever been crowded. 

Again, I look forward to it, but it looks a bit high for three 48/49
players.

I totally agree with you, and I hate the outdoor OT - DL powerleveler
types. We've fought in about every zone that isn't red to us already.
:-p
