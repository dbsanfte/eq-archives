Used the skill on and off in group today in Throne Room in CB.  Several 
times, got it to go off, never if I started it while my special attacks 
were greyed out, but several times if I clicked special attack (either 
kick or frenzy) after starting intimidate.  In fact, several times I saw 
it work after a successful kick (not that frequent an occurance) but not 
so much after a failed kick.  But thats probably just superstition.

I've got the skill up to 60, and its starting to strain my finances to 
use training points on it now; I've also taken my kick up to 40 based on 
the theory that for some reason that might help...and because its 
cheaper to raise that.  Neither go up much at all in use, so far.
