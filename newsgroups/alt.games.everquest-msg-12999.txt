Right.  And a great example, thanks for pulling it out of your logs.  

It's amazing to me how many people still just do tells 'can i get a
port?' or "sow plz" even when I'm anonymous.  I think they must do tells
to every wood elf and halfling wearing leather.  Going invisible cuts
down the spam a bit, but sometimes I just have to zone to get away from
the train of newbies.  

That said, I did do several free ports last night, including one to a
person who asked nicely and two to people I recognized as folks that had
helped me in the past.  For the person who was doing /shouts 'need a
port to WC plz paying 10p' I waited until they got up to 40p before I
did the port.  

I also met a person who wanted to pay after the port because they had
been scammed a lot.  I said no problem, and everything went fine, but I
was surprised because I had never heard of anyone scamming people on
ports.  I had been stiffed my tip once or twice by people who offered to
pay and then /e farted and ran off, but had never heard of it going the
other way.
