I have the AA Dragon punch.

I originally got it because I thought it an ideal way to stop mob casters.
Despite the fact it stops pretty much all PC spells (in test duels), it
works maybe 1% of the time on NPCs.

It has 1 use - the knockback allows you to position and push mobs (on
raids). For that its pretty nice I suppose.
