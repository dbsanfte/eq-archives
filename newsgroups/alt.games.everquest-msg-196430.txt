Under 15 or so there are plenty of mobs in PC, but it's easy to die
if you are fighting solo.  If you don't die the xp is, of course,
incredible.  I saw very few 12+ in LOIO when I was there hunting for
Sarnak Blood, but there were plenty of low levels near Cabilis.  So
a group could likely fight non-stop starting at around L16 near the
windmill and ending at around L30 in the Sarnak fort.  Unless it's
filled up in the last day or so, which I doubt after seeing the
numbers in PC.
