The copper medal of war drops from the boss in the first camp every time =
and is a rare random drop from any MoB in the second camp. =20

As a 51 shaman I could easily solo either one of them before the DX9 =
patch.  Got some warping pet aggroing the whole camp issues afterwards =
but that may be fixed now. =20

Talk to the general in the building next to the bank ("/say What camps" =
and he will tell you if they have been done yet) then to Scout  Hussman =
or Scout Danarin to initiate the battles.
