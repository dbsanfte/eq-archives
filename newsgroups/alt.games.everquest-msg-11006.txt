Those seem to be the most common to me, too. On the other hand, the only
time it realy irked me was when I attacked a "white" will-o-wisps only to
discover that it was THREE "white" will-o-wisps. My character could have
taken on two at once and *possibly* lived, but three... oh, well. Maybe
Verant will fix it in the next version. ;)
