I only started playing a couple months ago, and have been trying hard
to keep my main untwinked, despite offers of hand-me-downs from friends.
(I've bought gear in the Bazaar, but using my own plat.)  I figured I
wanted to experience even the lower levels properly, and not rush through
them and end up with a high level char that I didn't know how to play.

Even when I started up other characters, so far I've let them manage on
their own, again so I can learn what the other classes and regions are
like.  I'm told Misty Thicket is a great newbie zone, so why should I
twink my Halfling Druid and PL her past it without ever stopping to try
it out?

Now, that said, I don't have any problem with my alts getting a helping
hand from my main, any more than I would turn down a free buff.  When my
halfling spotted a few bone chips at an NPC merchant, I snapped them up
and dropped them in my shared bank.  My main then bought them for just
under 4pp each, knowing I can sell them for 4-5pp in the Bazaar.  The
plat is chump change for my main, but a godsend for my alt, but the same
transaction could easily have been arranged with another PC so it doesn't
feel like twinking to me.
