Since you've mentioned haste over 100% it would be a good time to tell
those who may not know: the haste percentage isn't what you lower your
delay by, its how many attacks in a set time span you increase by.

Say you've got a 20 delay weapon. It attacks about 30 times in a
minute. Put on a FBSS (21% haste). Some believe that would lower delay
to 16 because 16 is (approximately close to) 79% of 20 (applying the
haste percentage directly to delay) This is wrong. What actually
happens is you get 121% number of attacks over that period. About 36.
That works out to a new delay of a little more than 16.5.

If that math is too hard to follow assume 50% haste instead. To those
taking the shortcut and applying it directly to delay, they should
have their delay cut in half (double their attacks). This isn't the
case. With that 20 delay weapon example, with 30 attacks a minute, you
would actually increase to 45 attacks a minute (not 60), the
equivalent delay of just over 13 if my math holds up. People with Jade
Maces and Lammys are like little buzzsaws with good haste.
