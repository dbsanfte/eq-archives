Oh my god, they killed Vhalen!  You bastards!  I made it a point to stop 
by Vhalen every time I crossed SK for a while and cheer on Vhalen and 
harass his tormentors for several levels.  Most ignored me, one or two 
threatened to /petition me, and the trolls and ogres generally RP'd 
along.  
The Bardic community is more than a little miffed at the underwhelming 
combat prowess of NPC bards.  Every time Verant opens up a forum on ways 
to improve the classes, bards scream that NPC bards should at least sing 
selos and run for zone or SOMETHING.  Nope, they sit there and get 
slaughtered.
