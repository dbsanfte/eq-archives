I don't think people got lazy, I think the game only got faster. These
days, in most situations (groups/LDoN's), chain pulling is the standard.
so LOM, OOM, FOM, RFP, RDY, etc get used alot. I've been in several
groups that the only group messages are incoming messages and heal
messages. Everyone keeps pretty busy, esp with a monk chain pulling at
40%.
