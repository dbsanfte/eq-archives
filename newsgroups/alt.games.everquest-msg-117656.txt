You'd have to be a madman or a fool to use the cleric pet.  Luckily I am
both.  Think of it as a DOT instead of a pet and you are closer to the
mark, with the bonus that if you are clever you can move the DOT from
one mob to the next.  On the other hand, its a DOT that can die from
a riposte or DS or even just getting aggro (good thing its great at not
getting aggro, long as someone else is in arms reach of the mob)
