This isn't a problem for people who group, they clearly have far more 
choices at every stage but I can see that it's going to be a problem for the 
soloer. I think it's true that EQ2 is even tougher on the soloer than EQ1, 
at least at this stage in its evolution. This might change as they tweak 
things but I wouldn't expect to see anything dramatic. EQ2 was clearly 
designed with the grouped player in mind, despite SOE's claims of ample 
soloability. It's not really viable if it requires killing the same thing 
1000 times. I know I'd never put up with that.

That being said, I can't say enough about the amount of content in this game 
for the grouped player. I just finished up some quests in Stormhold, a place 
I thought I'd explored pretty thoroughly in beta. I'm now at the same level 
I hit in beta at my highest (24) and just discovered a system of tunnels 
below the armory that I never knew existed. Our group spent all night there, 
making progress on two quests that had been rather elusive and mysterious, 
and discovering a whole new world. We also hit the Tomb of Valor, an 
instanced zone that I never got flagged for in beta. We wiped at the 
entrance and there's an 8-hour lockout after exiting, so we'll have to try 
it again tomorrow. At level 24 I haven't even been through this one dungeon 
yet, let alone off the continent, and at 25 I can begin access quests that 
will take me off the continent. And everything I'm experiencing on my 
starting continent has an analog on the evil side of the world, so at best 
I've hit some portion of only half the world.

Maybe SOE will introduce more content for soloers as the game evolves. Right 
now it looks like the choice is either group up or face the 400 mobs at 25 
syndrome. It's not a problem for me, but I can see how it will affect others 
who want more pptions for soloing. God knows there are lots of morons out 
there playing and every time I  try a pickup group I'm reminded of why I'm 
so lucky to be part of a group that has been together since EQ, DAoC, SWG, 
and even CoH for some of us.
