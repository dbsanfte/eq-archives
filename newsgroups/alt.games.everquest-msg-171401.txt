According to the INT mana calc
http://eq.crgaming.com/misc/manacalc/intcalculator.asp the formula appears
the following:

MANA = (2 * LV) + (INT * LV / 5)

This means that:

MANA gained from +1 INT = LV / 5

(considering that the LV increase is not able to be changed by anything
other than EXP, which you can't buy or sell).

So based on this info, at LV65, +1 INT would give you +13 MANA.

At what LV does purchasing +MANA become better than +INT items or the other
way around?

At LV5, +1 INT would mean only +1 MANA, so +MANA is better.  However, at
LV65 wouldn't it be easier to find +INT items than +MANA which would give
you more for your coin spent (isn't it cheaper to buy +1 INT at LV65 than to
buy +13 MANA)?

I'm LV29 (Dark Elf Necro) now with +185 MANA.  Only items that are not + in
some stat are my cloth sleves, cloth shoulderpads, cloth pants, & cloth
shoes.  I've only got about 500pp total & this is my highest LV character so
I can't do anything too expensive.

Also what about buying items in Bazaar when you find them for low cost &
selling them for what most others are selling them for (like you see 3
people selling the same item, but one is 20pp, another is 60pp & another is
80pp, or one is 50pp while others are a few hundred pp)?
