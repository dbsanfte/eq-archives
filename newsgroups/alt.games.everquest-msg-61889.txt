Not sure.  I've got a SK up that way, but I keep her so far from everything.
. .I've never MET the guards.

Kill

Remember that killing Crushbone Orcs kills faction with Neriak.  In a big
way.  If you like Neriak, don't kill Orcs.  Don't get close to them, because
they WILL aggro.

Try Greater Faydark.  You can be bound anywhere in that zone, and it is
adjacent to BB.
