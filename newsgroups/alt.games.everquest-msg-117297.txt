Recipe sniped.

   So a person is expected to put down over a pound of chitterlings at one sitting,
then?  The recipe you give looks similar to others I have seen for the dish, so I
have no doubt to it's validity.  But still.... 10 *POUNDS* for 8 people?  And...
_and_ they are supposed to eat hog jowls and greens as well?
  In the words of my  Maine Coone cat, Bigguy, after he finished off Skitty Kitty's
portion of canned cat food as well as his own, "Ooof!"
   If you ever come over to my house for dinner, Biz, I'll remember to cook up an
extra large pot roast.
