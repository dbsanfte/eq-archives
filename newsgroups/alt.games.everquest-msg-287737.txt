Yes.  The number is in units of 1/10 second.  I think there's an upper
limit, maybe 600 (i.e. 60 seconds), but you can put more than one /pause
on different lines to get a longer pause.

As others have warned, there's no way to stop a social macro once you've
invoked it, so you can't use any OTHER social hotkeys until the long one
is finished.  You CAN still use the autoattack key, hotkeys that directly
invoke skills such as Bash or Kick, cast spells, etc.  You just can't use
more than one SOCIAL hotkey at a time.  Socials means those things where
you write up to five lines of commands.

The other tricky thing to know about /pause is that you can include it on
the same line as another command, so you can still get five lines of real
stuff plus any pauses.  However, the tricky bit is that you should put the
/pause command FIRST on the line (and put a comma between it and the other
command), even though the actual pause will happen AFTER the other command
on the line.

Two examples from my cleric bot:

Nuke:
   /pause 3,/assist
   /cast 4
   /pause 40,/gsay Nuking %T
   /sit
   /assist

The above assists to get the tank's target, pauses 0.3 sec to ensure my
target has finished changing, then casts a nuke.  Then it tells the party
what it's doing, pauses 4.0 sec to let the cast finish, then sits down,
and the final /assist retargets the tank (or sometimes the cleric, if the
nuke got aggro :-).  If I decide I need to stop the cast and heal, I can
hit the key that I have bound to the "stop casting" action -- but NOT a
hotkey bound to a social that does /stopcast, since that's another social.
Likewise, I can't use my /assist hotkey to get back to the tank to cast a
quick heal, but I can use my F# keys to switch targets and alt-# or click
on a gem to cast the healing spell.

CHeal:
   /pause 2,/cast 5
   /tt Complete Heal on >> %T << in 10 seconds...
   /pause 1,/cast 5
   /pause 85,/cast 5
   /sit

This starts to cast Complete Heal, pauses 0.2 sec, and tells the target to
expect the CH.  Then it tries casting it again in case the first try
fizzled, pauses 0.1 sec, and tries a third time.  (Yes, I've been known to
fizzle twice in a row!)  After the third cast, it pauses 8.5 sec before
sitting.  The cast, of course, take 10 seconds, but apparently the /cast 5
command itself takes about 1.5 seconds so only another 8.5 is needed for
the spell to finish landing.  You'll need to experiment to tune the pauses
if you want to minimize "lost" time.
