You just dont like ME or the people in it. I can understand that,
its a relatively easy loot heavy outdoor zone, so it pulls everyone
in, and generates the 'learning curve' trains as folks who dont
know what they're doing develop through trial and error.

Thats not a problem with the 'camp system' though, thats a problem
with you being in the top 10% of the playerbases skill and being
annoyed when people in the bottom 30 get you killed, force you to
zone, dump trains on you, or whathaveyou.

Even the most verant Sony Suxx0rz type would shy away from blaming
the other players on Sony. I hope.

Matt

(Sony Sux0rz! They should ban everyone who ever zones into ME,
except me!)
