I would suggest getting the Everquest book that has information
regarding all what is going on, reading it carefully.  I would also
suggest waiting till the Evolutions comes out.

If you can spare it, get the 2 year subscription.  it runs under $9/month
that way.

Also, before going and creating a character that you level quickly.
check out eq.castersrelam.com, for infomation on creating a
character.  I created a warrior, that has a deity of Rallos Zek,
and I can't use any of the neat - o tribunal specific northman armor
or weapons.....sucks.....I'd pay to switch deities, but I would not
want that to become a norm....so I am leveling, on a different
server, a barb warrior that is tribunal....
