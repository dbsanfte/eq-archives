The real shamanic traditions which spawned the class have one major
diffrence from the monothestic religions that spawned the cleric mythos.
Where the spirit resides after death. It is the key question that divides
the religions.

1)clerics believe that a soul resides in an afterlife perfectly suited to
either punish or reward the actions that man had in life.

2)shamans believe that the spirit hangs around and interacts with the world
of man, particularly those he had a connection to.

3)druids believe that the spirit came from a well of lifeforce and it goes
back into that well after death.

We can presume the game tried to make no distinction in correctness . The
approach was that of all are equally valid and now what would each result in
in magical world.

Not exactly . There god is bigger and most importantly not discrete from the
world but a part of it residing in it always. Priests intercede with the
natural course of events and the druid is not in any way lesser in this.
