Can somebody post the exact factions raised? As far as I remember,
killin coterie only raises Validus Custodus (Katta guards) and Nandyn
(spelling?), which I don't know what it is for. There's a few more
factions in Katta. I mainly try to find out, what faction the Katta
quest NPC's are on and how to raise it. The Sanctus Seru NPC killing
sounds most promising, but there's not much soloing possible. The
inside guards there assist, hit relatively hard, lots of roamers ...
and the Katta merchant/quest NPC's were deep red to me as lvl 56, I
assume Sanctus Seru is the same. Any ideas/details apart from zerging
it with some full group?
