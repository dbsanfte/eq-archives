Lots of solo encounter mobs in Antonica that you should be able to tackle 
at level 18.  Various gnolls, bears, wolves, skeletons, lizards.  For 
gnolls, try the Antonica road near the first bridge heading east from 
Qeynos, you will also find some bears and wolves in there.  For higher 
level ones, go further east, and north.  Also, Gnolls and lizards near 
Oracle station.  Skeletons east of Oracle station, as well as near the 
entrance to Stormhold.  You could try soloing snakes, beetles, and 
antelope in Thundering Steppes, I am not sure how well you will do as a 
tank at 18 to be honest.  If you can solo them, you can also get a quest 
from the trapper near the entrance to kill snakes or beetles to further 
increase your reward for doing so.
