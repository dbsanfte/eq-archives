LOL.  I'd make the screaming optional tho, usually it's the less
competent movie characters who do the screaming (i.e. those too lo
level to have the disc), unless the flick's a comedy.  I'd also
like to see a new Monk kick added that's not an attack but is
instead a leap, not too high, but fast so that they could use it
to disengage from melee, or gain a little on a pursuer, or cross
a larger gap than ordinary (i.e. heavily armored) fighters can.

Of course, one result of these changes would be that when a Monk
and a Ranger both decided to flee it would indeed be the Ranger
doing the screaming ("I don't have to run faster than the mob,
I just have to run faster than you").
