Hehe.  I know what you mean here.  When I was a young teenager, my older
brother introduced me to D&D.  He promptly decided he had no interest in it
after all, but then my Dad converts.  If you can believe this shit, we
actually burned the goddamned books in our fireplace, along with that same
brother's paperback copy of The Omen.  I asked why, if it was so necessary
to be rid of them, we didn't just throw those items in the trash.  As I
recall, I was accused of wanting to dig them out of the trash later on.
Fucking ridiculous.
