Velious is, to me at least, the BEST expansion in terms of "content".

This is a MMRPG - the RPG portion being key here. Luclin has amazing
graphics (though Velious really raised the bar too over what was there
before), and PoP is cool. Both added great features and some nice zones.
Velious, however, added a story. The zek, rif, dorf, and dragon factions and
the stories and quests that go with them are simply awesome, and are
designed to push you into virtually every facet of the game (large scale
raids, tradeskills, basic camps, etc., etc., etc.).

Perhaps the pinnacle of it all though is, as someone already pointed out,
the 10th ring war - it is a simply increadible thing to participate in. If
you are below 50 or so, and you hear of one starting, either sit up by Thurg
and watch, or get the heck out of the zone. Lag around Thurg will be some of
the worst in the game due to the shear numbers of dorfs, giants, and PC's
that cram in there during the war. It's virtually non-stop giant killing for
about 2 - 2ï¿½ hours or so. Not only is there all the rush of killing the
giants, but there's the heart racing action as one breaks ranks and charges
past you - the fear as you try and get it slowed and killed or otherwise
worry about your "last line of defense" group getting it or not.

Those who haven't at least watched one of these should definitely do it. If
you're on giant faction, then just sit around a watch. If you're on
dorf/CoV, get in the fray. Great fun.
