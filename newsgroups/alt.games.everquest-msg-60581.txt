I think it's acknowledged that the game suffers from endemic inflation
due to both the endless supply of cash and items, and the fact that
those items always filter down to the lower-level players. This causes
the rift between true newbies and twinks: While Verant *must* balance
the game for the "ideal", non-twinked newbie, this results in a lack of
challenge at lower levels and much ennui.

Would it be terribly unbalancing if players were allowed to donate cash
*and* items (including NO DROP items) to their gods for experience? I
think this would be the ultimate cash and item sink... As long as it
would not compete for efficiency with hunting, it seems like it would go
some way towards relieving inflation, without becoming the ultimate
power-levelling tool (because skills would lag behind).

Am I missing something really obvious? (Well, of course. Agnostics... I
think agnostics ought to be able to purchase XP at any non-KOS god, at
some XP penalty, maybe 20%)
