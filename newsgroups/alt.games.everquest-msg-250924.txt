Hmmm - in the years I've played the game I have:

Earned a college degree (3.95 GPA)
Kept a very healthy relationship with my GF
Switched careers and have a neat new job
Not let my cats die of starvation
Taken daily walks over 5 miles long
Hung out with friends (and reconnected with
  some I lost touch with when my mom died
  15 years ago)

And enjoyed the heck out of a neat game, and
interacting with people I'd never have met
otherwise.

So, why don't you get a clue and fuck off
yourself.

Thank you.
