I think the low end population is definitely dwindling making it virtually
impossible for a non soloing class to find a group. This fact really changes
the game's complexion and, from my perspective, really is a disencentive  for a
newcomer to stay with EQ.

Remember the early days? The crowds int he EC tunnel, bartering goods? Remember
the mobs in CrushBone?  No more. The newbie and low level lands are now a
desert,  hardly a toon to be seen anywhere.

Start a new toon and see for yourself.

So with this as a base only a soloign class BL, NECRO, DRUID will be in a
position to reach *adulthood* further flooding the high end market. And where
will all the new clerics, monks, warriors, Berserkers come from? Simply stated.
They won't.

Get the hint here SOE?
