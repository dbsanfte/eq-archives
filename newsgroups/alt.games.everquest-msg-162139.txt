Rangers are masters of the bow.  Rangers are pretty damned cool just
as they are.  Some of us <like> the image of Strider/Aragorn the Ranger
a lot better than the image of some candy-assed Elf wannabe assassin
skulking about trying to shoot things in the back.  A Holy Warrior at
home in the wilderness is, IMO, one helluva lot more "cool" than just
another "watch it, I just got my robe back from the cleaners today and
I don't want to have to pay to remove more bloodstains" poseur who's
really just another finger waggler in a snazzy leather disguise.

The only thing wrong with Rangers is that Endless Quiver is stupid.
Not as stupid as Manaburn was, but stupid.  Between that and the
only really "special" bows being makeable only by Wood Elves and
usable only by followers of Tunare, Fletching looks like a joke of
a tradeskill ("Hey!  You can spend countless hours and platinum so
that you can make 3, oh wait, what the hell, why not 4? arrows and
then quit because your market is <permanently> saturated").
