First, it's not as simple as "first hit counts." I've hit things and
then seen the name bar turn gray (meaning someone else would get the xp)
after someone else came in and hit it for more damage than I did. I
think there's a minimal amount of initial damage, or maybe an initial
type requirement.

I also had someone following me around and preemptively striking
anything I started to attack.
