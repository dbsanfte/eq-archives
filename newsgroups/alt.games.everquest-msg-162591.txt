Heh, what can I say?  I'm lazy, and I expected more from the Sony Atlas.  I
used to keep 'em all in a binder until about the time luclin came out, when
I just got too confused to keep it organized.  ;)
Alphebetical organization never cognitively worked for me, I'd spend waaaay
too much time trying to organize my maps by continent and zone connections.
So I guess I'm anal and lazy, which is admittedly a suspicious combination.
Maybe if I have separate binders for every continent......................
