Well, before they fixed the necklace, I did the register quest 4 times. 
  If you finish it you get one full level change at least 
Appreh==>Amiable==>Warmly ==> Ally for part of shadowhaven but the part 
of SH near Paludal caverns wasn't affected as much.  The Gearo quest 
isn't good enough for that part either.  There are other quests to get 
good faction in rest of shadowhaven but they require going all the way 
to katta and back.  Now if you have the time and inclination to get good 
faction in the whole of Shadowhaven, stop wasting time on the Gearo 
quest and look up the other quests.  Have fun.
