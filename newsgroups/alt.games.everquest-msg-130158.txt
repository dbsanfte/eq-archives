Paul is right.  You are the one bullshitting.  Read my reply to Bill Oliver
and YOU try to disprove teh claims made by me and the evidence I cite.
Consider this an addition to my "challenge" post.

Get a clue.  Inform yourself.

1400 combatants (as reported by international red cross - see link in
"challenge" post) ?!
come now. i suppose that an unwarned ambulance attack by isreali troops was
combatants too?  (it was NOT!) and the vacant cars that were carelessly run
over?  and the palestinian buildings?
there is no respect for palestinian life or property here.

> >what about the murder of 1000+ palestinians under isreali
> >oppression that happened FIRST?!

oppression started first... not that number of murders (see other provided
links and not JUST the AI link!) - yes, i should of made that a bit more
clear.
The following links describe this oppression and fully support my claims.
PLEASE READ IT COMPLETELY.

Article from Noam Chomsky (ZMAG) regarding Isreali treatment of the
Palestinians (oppression.. the one you've been waiting for!):
http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/articles/z8807-uprising.html
his sources are listed at the bottom - go ahead and look into them!

another anmesty international article:
http://web.amnesty.org/ai.nsf/Index/MDE150142002?OpenDocument&of=COUNTRIES\P
ALESTINIAN+AUTHORITY
a piece (i still urge you to see the ENTIRE article!)

"All Palestinians in the Occupied Territories are suffering collective
punishment for the actions of armed groups. More than 100 Israeli army
checkpoints barring access to villages and towns throughout the West Bank
and Gaza have denied Palestinians in the Occupied Territories freedom of
movement, damaging the education of the children, and impoverishing adults
whose unemployment has now reached 50% in many areas.
The demolition of Palestinian homes has made hundreds of families -
including thousands of children - homeless. "Such demolitions are
unjustified by military necessity," commented Amnesty International. 'Since
the beginning of the intifada more than 500 houses have been demolished in
the Gaza Strip alone.' "

here's a great opinion on the situation from an isreali citizen who seems to
value truth more blindly supporting his gov't.
http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=22&ItemID=2042
this is someone I truly respect and admire.

yet another article
http://zena.secureforum.com/Znet/zmag/zarticle.cfm?Url=articles/mar95niva.ht
m

and yet ANOTHER
http://www.zmag.org/turmoil_in_palestine.htm

will you disprove ANY of these claims?!  are you prepared to do the research
and truly challenge these claims?
will you (more like could you) find hard facts to disprove the claims made?
quit wasting my time as well as everyone elses and fully research YOUR
claims before you waste our time with them!

If you believe that my sources are not credible/accurate, go ahead and do
the research to PROVE them wrong.  Isreal is guilty of violating
Palestininan rights and that is FULLY supported by the links i've posted -
article dates are included.  are you going to claim that it is all bullshit?
go ahead and prove it wrong then.  the links FULLY support the claims i have
made.  and your claims?  you have yet to post any kind of support!!!!  good
luck arguing against Noam Chomsky's claims - its no easy task!

> Since my points were directed only at your use of AI
> to make a false claim to authority, I will not address
> your remaining claims about statements from various other
> advocacy groups.

afraid of what's contained in those other links?
or did you realize you CAN'T disprove them or their claims?!

i'm done here. you can post your research and findings over at
alt.music.tool as a new thread.
this thread is becoming ridiculously long, and is now simply a waste of
time.  i
can deal with the ignorant, but i have no time to waste on the stubborn and
the senseless who refuse to fully examine a post.  this isn't debate.  THIS
IS JUST YOUR FEAR OF BEING PROVED WRONG.

I've presented my argument and proved it with facts gathered through my
research.
My work is done here.

good night and good luck finding the true value of truth.
