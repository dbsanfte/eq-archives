I agree with the flagging system in general, however I also agree with 
opening up access to tier 2 planes.

Agreed, somewhat.  If you make the encounter such that the usual result 
goes from failing to passing anyway, what's the point?  Might be 
interesting to see what sort of suggestions there would be on *how* to 
fix the trials.

That's the thing though: you end up with a few members who are qualified 
to help others get flagged while the rest just aren't up to the task 
because they're the wrong class, not enough levels/AA, sub-spectacular 
gear, whatever.  So you end up monopolizing the time of those few instead 
of the load being spread across the pool of those are flagged.  If all 
classes were equally good at getting people through the trials this would 
probably be less of an issue.

For my guild anyway, it's not a matter of guild members being unwilling 
to help out, it's a matter of failing so many times, even while trying to 
flag people in their 60s, that morale gets depleted and it drives those 
who are capable of helping out away from the game entirely.

I agree, for things that require a raid force.  For something where you 
are artificially limited in numbers, especially to numbers this small, I 
have to disagree.  This hasn't proved much challenge to the uber guilds, 
but has caused a rather large rift in most mid-sized guilds.

Possible, yes.  Plausible, no.  I think we have about 70 primary 
characters, 90%+ of which are 55+ with 20% or so 60+, on the roster, so 
I'd consider us mid-sized.  After our resounding failure during our 2 
month push that flagged all of I think 5 members, our general consensus 
is that we need to go back and get some better gear for the core group 
that's (in theory) getting people through the trials.

Now here's the real problem: all the 60+s can no longer group with 
anybody else because they've pulled so far away while having access to 
tier 2 that tier 1 has gone light blue.  Yes, they can still group, but 
not for XP and let's face it, the loot in tier 1 is craptacular.  I've 
pulled better loot out of dulak while two-boxing my 45 enchanter and 
(then) 43 druid.

Is removing the flagging system for all the tier 2 planes the right thing 
to do?  I don't know.  But I'm somewhat relieved that I won't have to 
deal with the days on end struggle to get flagged after grinding myself 
numb to get Huntress.

It's not this part of your opinion that I take exception to.  It's the 
part where you assert that the only thing required to get an entire guild 
through the trials is that everybody who is already flagged just need to 
take 10 minutes out of their day to push someone through when it was 
apparent that you really didn't know what it took to get through the 
trials (I think you're a bit more enlightened on the subject at this 
point).
