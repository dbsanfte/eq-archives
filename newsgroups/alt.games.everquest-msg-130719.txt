man, this happened to me in a guild i was in

so i hate to go against the flow of posts here, but i know what's up


you never complained, did you?! did you?  they probably don't realize it's
such a strain


[BECAUSE] it feels good sometimes though, right? nothing cooler than porting
around the guildleader / raidleader / highest levels . . . it's quite an
honor

i'm posting only to see if i'm right, because i have a hunch



anyway - you certainly have the right to demand your respect, if for no
other reason than you've worked for it

all the advice the others posted will work
