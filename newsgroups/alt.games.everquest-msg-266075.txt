I am not one of those who think shovelling as many people onto one
server is a good thing. A game like Wish with *everyone* on one
server... bleah. There is an upper limit to what a community can have
before it splinters. There's also a lower limit to what is necessary
to keep it running.

From what I have seen in a EQ-clone setting 1500-2000 at primetime is
about right. It works five hundred more each way but with declining
quality. Above that and no one knows anyone outside their immediate
clique. Below that and you better get used to relying on yourself.
