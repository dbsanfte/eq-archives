Just thought I'd do the old Quenos to Freeport run as I had some time
to kill with my 46 BL.

It's just not the same as I remember it the first time with a 5th
level shaman. Heart pounding as I round each corner or enter each new
zone. No map, just following the rocks with the arrows. I made it in
only 3 trys. Then beg for a bind at the West Gate so I didn't have to
do it again before hunting. Little did I stop to think that I'd have
to run back to get trained and get my new spells when I hit 9th level.

Sigh, there's no going back to that sense of adventure as I was
exploring a new game.
