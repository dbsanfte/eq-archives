I played a monk as my main for 53 levels. (I retired him when I moved
to the the FV server) 

Your first mistake is assuming that the class will be crippled. 

Your second mistake is not accepting the fact that the class has been
overpowered for a long time now. They are arguably the best melee
class in the game currently (unless you require specific
sk/pal/warrior skills in a raid level encounter). They do massive
amounts of offensive damage from all sides of a mob unlike a rogue.
With ALL/ALL lightweight equipment monks can achieve plateclass
(SK/PAL) AC. There is a reason why you see so many twink/alt monks
running around. 

Mend will still recycle every 6 minutes, and with bindwounds you can
still heal yourself to 70% when soloing. (post-51 you can bind to 70,
and with AA points even higher). You can still FD when fights go bad
or you overpull. Your monks "soloing" abilities will still be intact.

No one knows exactly how the change will effect the class. My guess is
that monks won't get hit more often, but when they do get hit they
will take more damage. This will hurt raiding monks the most. 

Some "nerfs" are required. "Mud-flation" through the addition of new
weapons and gear has resulted in the monk class being out of balance.
Wait and see how the changes work before you condem them..
