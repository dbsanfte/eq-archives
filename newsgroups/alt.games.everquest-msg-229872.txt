	I'm not wrong.  I said that the instances of top posting 
seemed more frequent in these groups, but that the evidence points to
the fact that many people in those groups are using a poorly engineered
and deliberately nonstandard tool that was never meant for the task to post
to thse groups.  Outlook Express (tm) top posts by default, one of the
only mail user agents to do so.

	Microsoft users are used to this and dont see it as a disadvantage,
much the way that the owners of Ford cars dont see being found on the road
dead as a design defect.
