Here is a copy of the posting on secondary stats for skills from
www.eqtraders.com, which is where I get almost all of my tradeskill
information.  Specifically, DEX does affect Fletching skill increases, the
same as it does Tailoring skill increases.


Stats and Tradeskills
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----
Stats, and how they impact tradeskills, have been the subject of much
debate. The below information has been what we know directly from VI since
May 13, but I've now reworded it a few gazillion times because folks still
feel it's as clear as mud. ;)

As of May 13, 2001, the following information was confirmed directly to
Niami, by Yakatizma (tradeskills developer at Verant) with regards to stats
and tradeskills. This is the MOST recent information we have available,
despite at least a dozen different message board threads from folks trying
to pull information from old threads, other sites, etc. When we/I know more,
it will be posted here, but please, in the meantime, accept that this is as
recent/accurate as it gets. Debate it all you want, as Verant has been known
to be wrong before, but please, folks, don't expect me to re-re-re-restate
this information in every new message board thread that you feel like
starting. ;)

INT & WIS: whichever of the two is higher will affect skill increases when
practicing ALL tradeskills. The higher either your INT or WIS is, the
greater the chance you have for a skill gain while tradeskilling.

STR: higher strength will give you an added bonus to your chance at gaining
skill increases while smithing.

DEX: higher dexterity will give you an added bonus to your chance at gaining
skill increases while fletching or tailoring.

CHA: higher charisma, along with faction, will affect your buying and
selling prices with merchants.

Stats have no impact on your chance of success or failure when practicing
tradeskills. (Only your current skill is supposed to impact your chances of
success or failure when creating an item.)

Yes, this is subject to change/debate, but until otherwise corrected by
Verant itself, this is the last official word we have on the subject.

(Yes, I sound frazzled. I created these FAQs to stop the gazillion and one
threads asking for clarification, especially the ones requesting my personal
attention, and for some reason, there are even MORE threads than there were
before I created this FAQ back in May. :P)

According to the October 2001 Fan Faire in Orlando, the bonus for secondary
stats in tradeskills, such as STR for smithing, may not kick in until the
stat is 185 or higher. No further details are available.
