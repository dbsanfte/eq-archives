Acrylia Caverns

The Chieftain has gone on a vacation. We're retuning this encounter,
and beg your indulgence while we work on it. 
Spells

Fixed magician summoned focus earrings 
Characters on horses are no longer immune to Ignite Bones 
The Shadowbond series of spells can no longer be dispelled by the
Necromancer 
Nature's melody and Song of the Deep Seas should now stack with Dance
of the Blades 
Items

Added 'focus' effects to over 150 existing items 
Mischievous Chainmail armor is now Dwarf wearable (for those lil
Bristlbane worshipin' dorf rogues) 
Changed several of the new cultural chain skirts from Leg slot to
Waist slot 
Keys for Veeshan's Peak, Sleeper's Tomb, Vex Thal are now no-drop on
the Firiona Vie server 
The key to the Plane of Air should now disappear when the character
leaves the plane 
Fixed Sifaye, Owlbear Feather, Grimling fang and Rockhopper talon
darts to use the Throwing skill rather than the Archery skill 
Added a 4 second casting time to Golem Metal Wand 
Added a 3 second casting time on Egg Shaped Pumice 
Added a 4 second casting time to Oil of Fennin Ro 
The effect from Hammer of the Sun (Dawncall) now has a longer range 
Fixed it so you can't fire fishing grubs with a bow (we know this had
a lot of you worried...) 
Smithed Acrylia Chain and Plate armors are now magical 
NPCs

NPC casters should be a little bit smarter now. They will choose their
spells a little more carefully. 
Quests

Arbogast and Miller should be responding properly now 
Sir Lucan's skeleton should be available again 
Fixed spawns in the Grey for Beastlord Epic 
The Neriak Initiate Breastplate recipe should now work 
Freeport Monk Guild Master Klom Jyson should be responding now 
Made several adjustments that should fix issues with the 10th ring war
Tradeskills

Made some changes to the General Blacksmithing difficulties to make
the progression in this trade skill more logical and to allow for more
variety in that path 
Added more than 200 smithing recipes 
Enchanted Clay is now stackable 
Sheet of Fiery Metal, Essence of Fire, Imp Blood, and Fiery Temper are
now stackable 
Enchanted HQ Ore can now be worked into rings, jointing, sheets,
bricks, and blocks in a standard forge 
Pet Changes

With this patch we've made some rather sweeping changes to the way
pets work. 
Pets will not attack mesmerized creatures. Pets basically treat
mesmerized NPCs as if they were dead 
Pets are neutral to NPCs. Monsters will not attack pets first unless
the pet is being aggressive to something 
Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature if no player does
damage to that creature 
Pets take ZERO experience from a creature unless no player does damage
to that creature 
The exception to the above rule is Dire Charmed pets, which will take
a share of the experience scaled by the amount of damage they do. In
most situations (with an active party, for example) the Dire Charmed
pet will not take experience. Like all pets, they will take 75% of the
experience if no PC does damage to the target. As long as a player
does damage to a creature, a Dire Charmed pet will never take more
experience than it used to. 
Charmed NPCs will now respond to the /pet report health command 
/pet sit down command should now work on charmed NPCs 
Fixed a bug that was preventing reclaim energy from working on
Magician Epic pets. 
Miscellaneous

Fixed a bug that was causing a person that logs out with "damage
shields: OFF" to be unable to see damage shield even when they turned
them back on 
Fixed a problem that was causing crashes when /following someone on a
horse if they went out of range 
Fixed a bug that prevented targeting an invisible NPC from horseback,
even with See Invisible
