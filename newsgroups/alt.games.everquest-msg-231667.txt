But it would be a nice feature to have if you wanted to enable it.  I group
with a real life friend who lives nearby.  Once we hook up in the game one
of us will call the other on the phone and turn our speaker phones on.  For
us, this is far superior to type chatting to one another.  Plus I think this
would help some of us who enjoy getting into character to have more of a
role-playing exp.
