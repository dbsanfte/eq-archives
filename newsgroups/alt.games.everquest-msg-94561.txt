After reading some reviews on www.tomshardware.com, I'm thinking about
upgrading my video card to the new GeForce 4 Ti4600. Right now I'm
using a GeForce3 Ti200.

Before I spend the money for a new card though, I was wondering if
anyone had tried EQ with a GF4 yet.  With the GF3 I can only load a
few Luclin models, or the game gets too laggy to play on raids with
lots of people.  I'm hoping that by upgrading it would be playable
with all the models turned on during raids.

Thanks,

Golin
