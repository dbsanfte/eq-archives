I found this spell in Paineel's Shadowknight guild, and bought it for around
20pp.  The coffins are sold by the same vendor as the spell, are
non-stackable, but are also not containers.  They cost around 32pp, for
anyone who was wondering.

I have not had occasion to use this spell yet, so my question is this:  Are
there any limits on the spell (i.e., it won't summon the corpses of players
over level 40 [arbitrary number based on the next level summon corpse
spell]) ?  Does it have the same functionality as the level 39 Summon Corpse
spell?  If there are no limits on the spell it wouldn't seem very
Vision-like, but many of the recent changes have fit that description, so
I'm certainly not ruling it out until I get some more info.  Caster's Realm
has no info on the spell yet, other than the player whose corpse will be
summoned must be in your group and in the same zone as the corpse, which
IIRC is also a requirement of the level 39 version.  Any input will be
appreciated.
