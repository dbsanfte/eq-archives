Also of intrest is that canada has socialized medicine . His actual health
care costs would have been close to zero even if his story was true . A
month or two unemployed should be no hardship for any family who takes even
the bare minimum money precaution. Whether they have a system like the USA
for unemployment I do not know; I would expect it to be even more generous
than ours since they are a more socialized country by far. Also of intrest
is the apparent lack of friends and family to help with any unforsen burden
brought on by idiotic financial policy.

In other words of course this is a scam . Probably a mass news mailing on
hundreds of newsgroups looking for low hanging fruit . Might as well get the
money from people who are just giving it away and probably not even illegal.
