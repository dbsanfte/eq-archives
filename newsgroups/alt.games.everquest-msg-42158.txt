You need to make a macro. Just about any (all?) command you can type in the
command line can be put into a "social" macro. On the right hand side of
your screen (by default) is a key that should say "Socials". There are 10
banks of 12 programmable keys. The first are already programmed, but you can
change them if you want (although there should be no need with 100 blank
buttons.)

Use the little arrows to make to the second bank of 12 and then right click
on any of the blank buttons. Type in a Name, and then on the lines you can
type in the commands. Just remember to start each line with the "/" and you
can't continue one line onto the next (as far as I know.)

As far as actually programming the keys, I am a novice. I made a "Friend"
key, so that instead of typing "/w friend all", I can just punch the
"Friend" key. I have made a few others using the %T variable (which inserts
the name of the mob you have targetted) when pulling.

I believe there are some resources out there, and I am sure someone here can
point you in the right direction.
