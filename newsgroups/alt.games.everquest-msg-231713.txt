Very interesting.  My roommate was in a group where things went *really wrong*
and this same monk immediately went LD.  10 minutes after the timer ran out he
was back online LFG.  He didn't say a *word* to anyone that had been in the
group with him, and he had been the Group Leader.  Hmm... do I see a pattern
here?  If I can't count on a teammate when things get rough I can't count on
him period.  
The monk didn't get on my ignore list for *one* LD.  The monk is on my list for
*three* LD, including this one, all three shortly after the mission started,
once before we even enterred the dungeon.  
I can buy into the "bad connection" thing only so much.  You realize the time
limit on a LDON?  If you care enough to sit around BB with *lfg* on for 20
minutes and join the group, I expect you to care enough to reboot and get your
ass back online.  And if you have a problem with LD  in LDONs the LEAST you can
do is warn your groupmembers up front.  
Note: I only have EIGHT people on my Ignore list.  You really have to screw up
pretty bad to get on it.
