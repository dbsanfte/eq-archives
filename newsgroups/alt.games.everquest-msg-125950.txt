Yes, as a cleric it might have been possible at very low levels to deliberately
max out bind wounds and get more HP per minute in heals that way than
by medding, but rapidly I'd gain better heals and better med skill and
surpass that.

On the other hand, for a non caster (monk, warrior, rogue) bind wounds
is a lot faster way to get to 50% than sitting to heal, and its quite possible
if you have good hp/ac gear to solo exclusively on that "bottom half" of
your hp, which you can restore relatively quickly.

Further at high levels its possible to arrange things so you can work the
bind wounds angle to much higher chunks of your HP total.  Again, if
you have heal spells its not worth your while but its very worthwhile
if you don't have that option.  Healing via sitting takes -far- longer
than medding up, unless of course you are loaded down with regen
equipment...

For a bard, this effect is magnified even more, as the bard can sing heals
and simultaneously bind wounds on himself or whoever is lowest on HP,
quite rapidly everyone is at 50% and the bard can go grab a soda for the
slower regen up to full if desired.

For Pure Casters (well, mage/wiz/ench anyway) the question becomes
whether the faster heals are worth the reduced mana not generated while
healing.  Mages often tend to have excellent bind skills as they get
their bandages for free, important early in their carreers, and never run
out, important later when most work is a long way from a vendor.
