You will not evade me, dm512@my-deja.com (Mort Gage):

You don't  have any affliction type spells.

Enh Haste means the buff casts faster. And since this is a level 1
focus, it'll only work on spells below level 20.

No clue why your other items aren't working, unfortunately. Also, your
summoned focuses seem messed up. Jedah's Choker saves reagents,
Tavee's mantle extends buffs, Jolum's bauble lowers mana for dd
spells, Gallenite's bracer raises DDs (not AOEs), Naki's ring lowers
casting time.
Also, your Tavee's mantle should do the same thing as your clawed
knuckle ring. Try summoning the bracer, the bauble and the ring and
see what happens when you nuke while wearing them.
