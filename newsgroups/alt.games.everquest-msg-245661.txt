Is there somewhere out there where some wonderful person with WAYYY too much
time on their hands has compiled a list of all the insta click items in EQ and
which classes can use them and what they drop off of?  LOL

Looking specifically for Pally clickies and Druid clickies, but heck if there
is a complete list for all of em, that'd be even greater!

*crosses fingers*

Thanks gang!
