I was never stupid enough to slowly kill myself with cigs, so 
I already pay zero for my smokes!
I don't think you can beat that, spammy!

HAR HAR!

That reminds me of a definition i once read of the difference
between wisdom and intelligence, if you don't know:

Intelligence is learning that smoking is bad for you.
Wisdom is either then not starting smoking, or quitting smoking
if you already are.
