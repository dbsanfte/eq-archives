Ok, fine.  Darn Sony!  They do the same evil thing with electronics - they
used the profits from my Walkman to make CD Walkman, which I had to buy all
over again.  And they used THAT money to fund crappy memory stick music
players that I didn't even want!

Oh, and blast Pixar!  They took all my money from Shrek, and instead of
improving that, they spent it on Shrek 2!  To heck with my local diner! 
I bought breakfast, but instead of making that last all day, they started
working on lunch, which I had to buy all over again!

>So what should they have done, I don't hear you ask?

What I wish you'd ask is "What should _I_ have done"?  It's not been a secret
that Sony has been working on EQ2, and that it would be another competitor for
EQ1.  What do you feel you should have done differently?  What will you do
differently in your next game (or in EQ1, if you're staying) to prevent your
fine payments from being misused by the company to make new products?

As a player, I feel I've gotten more value from EQ than any other game I've
owned.  I've also spent far more money on it, but even so, it's been
well worth it.  It has always been clear that it wouldn't last forever, and
even if it did last a long time, it would stop being the absolute premium
MMORPG at some point.  That point was about when DAoC came out, IMO.  EQ was
then "mature" enough that true MMORPG newbies would have a hard time choosing
it as their first, unless they had friends/family urging them to do so.
Others may argue that it happened last week, or that it will happen next week.

It will happen to ALL games.  Eventually new games will take over the
mindshare of the gaming community, such as it is.   Old games can still be
fun, but it's ludicrous to expect any leader to stay that way forever.

I just find it hard to be angry about it.  I'm still having fun in EQ1, so
I find it hard to think that EQ2 is all that important to my EQ1 experience.
I played the EQ2 beta, and have friends playing, so I'm glad to hear about
it, but EQ1 has some fun left for me.
