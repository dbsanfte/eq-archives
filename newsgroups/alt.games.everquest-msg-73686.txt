Ok, I can't decide. We're a few friends that are going to hunt together,
there is already a shadow knight and a cleric, and I am left here wondering
what class would go well with either. Now, don't get me wrong, I'd love to
play both classes, but I don't know which one will fit best into a group.
Both have their strong points and weak points. Any ideas?

Solitude :o)
