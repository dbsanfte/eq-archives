I know it. My original post has been hijacked to say the least. I know
a LOT of military people who game and play EQ. I know a lot of people
IRL shipping out. I know a lot of officers who leave families behind
in my town, to work at a base which is going to be a high priority
target overseas. Yesterday, I drove to work, and saw Marines full chem
suits jogging at a training base. I see things go on in my town, and I
think most of the people can smell war coming.

I don't invite-want-expect any reply intended to demonstrate
opposition to the War. I expected a few people to come forward and
share their stories about servicemen who play EQ and are shipping out.
I don't see it as validation of any political scheme to worry about
our friends.

I was trying to point out what I thought was a concern for many, and
it turned into a soapbox for people who probably don't even play EQ.
