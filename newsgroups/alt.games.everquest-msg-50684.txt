You will have to use general question operatives too.. Like How, Why, What,
etc...

A Real good one to use is "What About ... "

So if the NPC says, "The [Ry'gorr Orcs] are haters of Men".. A good reply
would be (using /say) "What about Ry'gorr Orcs?"  or "Who are Ry'gorr Orcs?"
(Use 'What About' frequently, most NPC's seem to respond to that, not all,
of course.. )

In addition, not every NPC will reply to just stuff in brackets.. Sometimes,
you need to figure out what to say without the asisstance of the brackets..

Try going to some various NPC's in towns and ask them "Where is the Bank?"
or "Where can I buy food?"  Many of them will tell you...

(Psst. Don't forget to target them too.. )
