Point taken, I am aware of the LoD and AV stuff, The Pantheon just
don't seem to register on the radar as much.  (Honestly, the last
reference I heard about The Pantheon about this was totally unrelated
to power, rather how they were always helpful.)

Well, we did spend a bit of time learning PoA, but I can say that we
are very comfortable there up through the 7th Island.  We have failed
on the Queen twice now, but will get her next time.  Of course we were
able to handle a full King respawn that somehow aggrod us when we were
porting out after our first Queen CR, so we did learn something.  
I do think that we can hold our own with Neo Alliance and AV/BH, and
figure that the next several months will determine if we have what it
takes.
