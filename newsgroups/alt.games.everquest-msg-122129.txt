But no amount of lurking lets you see how many responses he gets in email
that are exactly what he's looking for.  I know if I wanted to post
something like this where *all* I'm looking for are one-on-one email
responses, I'd never bother checking what anybody actually said here.

I respect your distaste for account selling, though I don't necessarily
agree with it.  But don't let it blind you to reality.  If account selling
didn't work, there wouldn't be a site called playerauctions.
