There is no such listing for Xev that I am aware of. What you should do
is keep an eye on the guild tags of the folks you usually group with. Do
you find yourself more often with one particular guild? Start asking
your groupmates about their guilds and the purposes of their guilds. Try
doing a websearch or an EZBoard search for "guild" and "Xev"- you may
find a few that way.

If there was a guild name you remember admiring, do a "/who all guild
"name"," and you'll see if anyone is one with that guild tag- send them
a tell. Tell them you have an interest in joining, and what are the
requirements.
