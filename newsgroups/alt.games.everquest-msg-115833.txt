With the same amount of mana and time the druid can kill, oh, a dozen orcs
in CB and sell their belts for 5g each.  They can kill 20 spiderlings,
tailor using the silks, and sell them for many plat.

Porting CAN cost druids (or wizards...or clerics with rezzes, enchanters
with clarity, etc, ad nauseam) money.  You are lying to suggest otherwise.
