[11] Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of =
his hands shall be given him.


[12] As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule =
over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and =
destroy the way of thy paths.


[13] The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.


[14] The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, =
and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of =
the poor is in your houses.


[15] What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces =
of the poor? saith the LORD GOD of hosts.


[16] Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, =
and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing =
as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:


[17] Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of =
the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.


[18] In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling =
ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like =
the moon,


[19] The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,


[20] The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and =
the tablets, and the earrings,


[21] The rings, and nose jewels,


[22] The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, =
and the crisping pins,


[23] The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.


[24] And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall =
be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair =
baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning =
instead of beauty.
