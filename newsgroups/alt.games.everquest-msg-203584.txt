Eldritch Rune is one of the best AA there is. Keep Arcane Rune up at all
times but when a mob is beating on you and you can't cast you can stab your
ER key and be shielded for enough time for tank to gain aggro back or a
healer to save your life.

I don't think it is 18AA, i think each level is three AA but not sure on
that, long time since I trained it.
