- Snipped from EQ Casters Realm, which snipped it from EQ Developers'
Forum -

Kunark Evac spells: these will now work anywhere in the world. You won't
have to be in a Kunark dungeon to use them. This change will apply to both
Wizards and Druids evac spells.

Druid Spell Egress: this spell will now work indoors. It didn't make sense
for the group version to work indoors (a mistake on our part) and not have
the self version work indoors.

- Lawrence Poe

Sounds to me like these changes are either live or going in next patch, not
having a druid or wizard high enough to test them out, I don't really
know...
