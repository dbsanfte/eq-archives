I would consider upgrading graphics card as my Voodoo5 was giving me such
crappy performance on my 800mhz system.  256 will cut it but I wouldn't
display all the new models.  Doubling the ram woudn't hurt and if you can
use DIMMS they are dirt cheap now.  Bought 512 for under $100 in December.
Geforce3 Ti200 ran me about $150 but with the new Geforce4's the 3's should
drop in prices.  Hard to find decent Voodoo drivers to work with EQ as well,
whereas Nvidia has some solid drivers and excellent support.
