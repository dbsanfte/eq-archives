If at all possible however, avoid the GF4 MX, it's a mildly souped up 
GF2, it's still better than what you have by quite a bit, but, not all 
that great for EQ.  It will have acceptable performance in most zones, 
but, expect zones with lots of trees to be a real problem for it.  
Whatever you do, do not get the GF FX 5200 (which is not listed above).
