I was under the impression the demo for EQ given away on PCZone was plain
ol' original... turns out my brother (who has a similar PC now to what mine
was when I started EQ) hasn't got the hardware to play it... according to
him, the version he's trying to log into is expecting to find post-Luclin
grade hardware that he just doesn't have.

If I go round to his house, re-install it and turn off all the optional
downloads, can I get it to run on his old-style system, just to give him a
taste of EQ?

TIA
