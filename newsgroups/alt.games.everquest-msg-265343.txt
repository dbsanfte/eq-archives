Yes, I did that one too I think. I've done dozens of quests on the Isle and 
hunted I think every one of the nameds. Fun place, and gives me an idea for 
a separate thread. I'll discuss there.

Yeah, they're clearly one of my favorite type of quest, another being the 
solo instanced quests that you get for class advancement. It's very cool 
when you see an item drop and everyone is wondering "wth is that". Ooooo 
it's a quest object. And of course nobody knows what the reward is. Great 
adventure.

I'm having the same experience. I just logged out of my current main (22 
Mystic/22 Alchemist) after a great little romp through Stormhold (fighting 
guardian writs in the Library). He's a great character for exploration 
because I can go lots of places I haven't yet explored in Antonica without 
getting aggro. But unlike any other MMOG I've played, I enjoy switching 
around to alts in this game. I made my first Mage archteype yesterday and 
spent the day on the Isle. Once again, I came away thinking ... "Hmm, mage 
at retail?"
