I been getting great deals. People are selling kunzer cloaks for as
low as 70 plat on their vendors while in the same zone they sell to
npc vendors for 83 plat 8 gold. Quick way to get some cash every so
often.

Unfortunately everyone seems wise about forest loops =/ never see them
below 300 plat lately.
