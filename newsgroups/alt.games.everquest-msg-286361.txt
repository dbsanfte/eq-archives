After checking it out, I would agree. The new version seems harder to get 
used to than it should be. There is too much empty space, and it doesn't 
appear to be laid out very well. Plus, I really liked the fact that with 
the previous design I could instantly see if the stats displayed were 
offset by my not yet meeting the recommended level, and by exactly how 
much.

Designing the UI and actually programming it are often two very different 
things. Some programmers have a knack for UI design. Others should leave 
the it to someone else.

I give the new item window a big thumbs down. Gimme back the old one.
