}1. Would you tell him in advance what you paid for it? (I'll assume no for
}now)

No, if it's a friend, I'd probably find out he wanted the spell right 
after I told him, "Man, you won't believe this! I found Sunstrike on a 
vendor for 300pp!" But even if not, I'd make damn sure he knew how vastly 
overly much I was profiting.

}2.  If he later came up to you and said "Man, that spell I paid you $20k
}for, I see 3 vendors selling for ~1K.  How much did you get it for?"  What
}do you say?

"Aww, bogus, sorry about that, here's yer money back."
