}>No, but then, neither did the 10% Sanji quoted or the value from FAIR, or 
}>even Rush's figure...
}I disagree.
}This is what Sanjian wrote;
}"How many students know they're taking a 10% risk
}of being infected if they're sleeping with an
}infected person?"
}This is what Limbaugh said;
}"The condom failure rate can be as high as 20
}percent. Would you get on a plane -- or put your
}children on a plane -- if one of five passengers
}would be killed on the flight? Well, the statistic
}holds for condoms, folks." 
}Totally unjustifiable bullshit. 

I'll agree with your assessment of Limbaugh, but not of Sanji.

}>}>  Look, condoms just aren't perfect, and we can 
}>}>argue forever about what the appropriate statistic is.
}>}I agree. 
}>}What I dont agree with is Sanjians assertion that
}>}a person wearing a condom is ".... taking a 10%
}>}risk of being infected if they're sleeping with an
}>}infected person?"
}>So he left out the word 'greater'. So sue him.
}Its an important word to leave out. Its not like
}he left out an apostrophe. And, it was
}deliberately missed out.

I think it'd be impossible to prove whether leaving it out was deliberate 
or not.  In past arguments Sanjian has proven to not be a deliberate 
liar, what's more, if pressed I've even see him admit to mistakes, and 
hence I'd give him the benefit of the doubt this time.  Especially 
since, on my way out the other night, it occurred to me that I couldn't 
get that sentence to work just by adding the word 'greater', either.  
It'd have to be, "... taking a 10% risk of being infected anyway if 
they're sleeping with an infected person and would otherwise have gotten 
infected without the condom?"

At which point it becomes a big wonky sentence.  Saying it the way Sanjian 
said it may have been wrong, but it at least verged on comprehensible. :)

}Have you heard of the "Wicked Bible"? 
}A print of the King James version contained the
}following "Thou shalt commit adultery"
}Perhaps he should have said in his defence;
}"So I left out the word "not". So sue me."
}The printer was fined 300 pounds. 

Sure he wasn't sued for 300 pounds? :)

}>}>  Sex ed has a lot of problems... It's so under seige that 
}>}>it's not at all suprising they can't always get the best teachers, is it?
}>}Did you never read the instructions on a condom?
}>In all probability, yes.  I doubt I'd grant them more credibility than the 
}>CDC, though.
}Why this non-sequitur?

I don't think it's a non-sequitur.  My point was that I've read the CDC 
docs, which are not trying simultaneously to promote a product and make 
money, and are willing to write longer sentences because they aren't 
restricted to the back of a condom wrapper.  So I wouldn't expect a 
greater insight to be revealed on the back of the condom wrapper.  Or the 
box, for that matter.  Nor would I expect all condoms to have the same 
instructions printed on them.  Especially the ones that say, "for novelty 
use only".  But I think it's a safe bet that I've read at least one condom 
wrapper.

Actually, on a side note.  There's a new female condom called "Reality".  
If you ever get the chance to get drunk with some friends and read the 
enclosed map-sized fold-up instruction booklet, do it.  It's full of such 
insightful advice as "Some women experience difficulty using Reality." :)

}>}Perhaps he was told that, but I find it amazing,
}>}not only that he was told that, but that he
}>}BELIEVED it.
}>Well, then you really ought to be amazed at the sad state of affairs that 
}>is sex ed in this country.  And further amazed that we're probably doing 
}>better than average...
}The problem I have here is not that there is no
}sex education,... I could understand that, but
}that, a teacher handling sex education is giving
}out basic information that is wrong, and that
}no-one in that class, school, or parental circles,
}ever questions it.

Well, they're the teacher, they should know.  Not many parents chew out 
the physics teacher for teaching theories that were discredited in this 
April's issue of Physics Today, either.  An amazing amount of 
misinformation and out-of-date information gets passed on in schools.  
This is not good, but it would be incredibly onerous to try to police it.

And sex ed is usually complicated by those very people in "class, school, 
and parental circles" questioning it.

}I can't imagine how anyone, especially an
}adolescent youth, with the quality control they
}tend to give condoms, as a solo pastime, could
}believe that it is impossible for a condom to ever
}break. Or heard that apocryphal joke about the
}vengeful bastard with a pin, inside the condom
}factory.

There's always one.  Today, Sanji was the one.

}If you say it happened, it happened, but to me, it
}would be like a music teacher telling their pupils
}that all violins have six strings.

Do they?  I don't play violin.  Either way it seems like an odd metaphor 
here.  It'd be more like the teacher telling them that songs are in Major 
keys, and failing to mention that there are also Minor keys and pentatonic 
scales and John Cage and whatnot.

}This crafty conflation between the failure rates
}of condoms, and the likelihood of being infected,
}is at the heart of the dishonesty shown by both
}Limbaugh and Sanjian.

It's only dishonesty if intentional.  Unfortunately a fat lot of this 
conversation expired off the server over the holiday, so I have no idea if 
Sanjian said "oops" or not.

}>I suspect I read what I 
}>thought Sanjian meant, rather than what he wrote.
}I think you missed out both on what he meant, and
}what he wrote.

I think there isn't enough evidence to determine what Sanjian meant 
available to me.

}What he wrote was a lie, and what he meant was to
}scare uninformed, naive people into Church
}sanctioned sexual practices. 

I find it shocking how quick people are to jump up and yell "LIAR!" at 
people who may have made a simple mistake.

}A subject where their  track record of hypocrisy
}is almost as boundless as their lust for wealth.

Which they?  Is this the mysterious "They" in "That's what THEY say" 
rearing its ugly head?  Is Sanjian part of They?  Will he teach us the 
secret handshake?
