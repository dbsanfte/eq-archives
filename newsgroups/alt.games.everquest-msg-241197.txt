For further information on this widespread driver to new graphics
engine issue, please view these threads...

Not only 7500 series are listed in the resources here (All in Wonder,
8XXX 9XXX listed as well as various nvidia products etc...). I will
warn ya that after the patch tonight the newer drivers listed on the
sony site may need to be reinstalled like they said about afther the
last patch (but doubtful, they were wrong before). It is hoped that
the frame rate issues, plainar and GoD freezing, and other problems
will be corrected in the patch tonight. Hoping for the geomemetry to
be fixed to... really sucks to zone and be in limbo and /rewind is an
unknown command? Argh... Fustrating - YES. Worth getting upset about -
Uhhh, no, it's a game. Ahhh... I feel alittle better...

*Drood crosses his fingers and dares to hold his breathe till
tomorrow's patch is complete*
