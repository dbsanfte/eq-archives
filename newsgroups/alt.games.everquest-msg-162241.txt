I like to think of it as two classes whose contribution is quite visibly
apparent to the rest of the group.

But, in that scenario I described, we would not have survived if the tank
hadn't taunted the mobs off the casters, the ranger hadn't kited the train
while not getting adds, the shaman hadn't slowed, the beastlord hadn't
sacrificed his pet by siccing him on the unengaged mobs to buy us some time,
and the wizard hadn't gone all-out to burn down the mobs.

As much as it sounded like I was saying that everyone would have died if not
for me, that's not quite the whole story.  We would have died if any one of
our party hadn't reacted so well to the train.  I was lucky to be in a good
group; if I had been in a bad group, then all the healing in the world
wouldn't have meant squat.  :)

Hehehehe.  Backstabs are nice.  The assassinate skill is awesome - once
grouped with a rogue in Dragon Necropolis, and it made my jaw drop every
time the rogue took out those mobs in one shot.  I often wish I had
sneak/hide.  And I absolutely love rogues that can disable those darned
annoying traps in Ssra.

I bet you could tell a good story or two.  =)  I for one would love reading
what it's like to be another class... all I've ever been is a cleric.  It's
scary how much I don't know about other classes.

Hehehe... well, I would like to hear about it.  ^_^
