In all the excitement of SoL's release, and all the pain, suffering, and
gnashing of teeth involved in upgrading, I totally forgot to note that
the biggest thing on my SoL wishlist was not brought by the Luclin
Fairy. We didn't get a /raid channel.

If you are equally disappointed, please feel free to join me in writing
in on Sony's developer's boards, and e-mailing to remind them that Brad
said a while ago they wanted to implement it and had been working on it.
We really need that feature more than the ability to have red braided
hair instead of yellow.
