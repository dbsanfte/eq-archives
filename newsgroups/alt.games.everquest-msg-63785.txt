I've still got my old faithful Voodoo 3 although I havent tried the test
server. As your'e probably aware the makers of the Voodoo's are history now
but there are still some drivers being posted so it might help if you sought
them out.
It's a shame the Voodoo's are no more, they were really the dogs tits, I can
still remember my Voodoo 1 and it was like whoa! :)
But pretty soon you're card will be obsolete so its not just Luclin you'll
be splashing out on a new card for, unless its the only game you play, which
knowing EQ its probably the only game you have 'time' to play :)
