And there you have it. Druid is already the most popular class
in the game. I would be surprised if that didn't hold true even
if you just looked at 55+ players, either.

If the class was broken, it wouldn't be so popular. EVERY class
has its weaknesses. What we have here with this petition is a
bunch of people who want to have their cake and eat it too.
Druids are certainly not alone in this respect, but they have 
the largest number and hence the collectively loudest voice.

And yes, my highest leveled character is a druid.
