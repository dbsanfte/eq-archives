It's been a long time, but let's see what we got.  Looking at the Caster's
Realm spell list, the most important spells I see are:

Level 1:
Minor Shielding.  Self-only AC buff.
Pendril's Animation.  Pet.
Shallow Breath. Debuff/DOT.
Strengthen.  +10 str.  Pet buff.

Level 4:
Gate.
Haze.  AC buff for you and your pet.
Invisibility.
Juli's Animation.  Pet.
Suffocating Sphere.  Debuff / DOT.

I don't remember using pets until level 8 or so, but with experience I can
see they'd be handy.

General strategy:
Summon pet.
Buff self with Minor Shielding and Haze.
Buff pet with Haze and Strengthen.
Hit mob with DOT.  Mob hits you and pet jumps in.
Melee until mob dead.

Those are the most important ones that I'd recommend buying as soon as you
can afford them.

The next batch to save up should include:
Level 4:
Color Flux.  Short-range AE stun.  Good for Stun-and-Run if things get
  hairy.
Fear.
Mesmerize.  At level 4, you're pretty much going to be doing single-pulls,
  but it may come in handy.
Tash.  Alt strategy: pull with tash, then hit with DOT.

Of course, I recommend getting EVERY spell eventually.  By the time you hit
8, you should have all the level 1 and 4 spells.
