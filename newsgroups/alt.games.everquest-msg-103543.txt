Yes they were.  But not in the way you twist it below:

Excuse me?

Hint:  If it seems to make "no grammatical sense at all", you're
reading it wrong.

The Framers of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were learned
men whose English skills far exceeded the norm today.  Madison,
especially, is like reading a PhD paper.  Washington was
surprisingly erudite as well, to the point where his speeches
are hard to follow (this is why there are damned few
pithy Washington quotes).  Jefferson was a clear writer,
but extremely skilled in the language.


>Well, maybe it makes sense...lemme re-write it for clarity:

Let's not, if you're going to do it so badly.

>A well regulated Militia shall not be infringed.

Errrnt!  The Second Amendment clearly states that what should
not be infringed is the "right of the people to keep and bear arms".
I'm one of the people, how about you?

Nowhere does the Second Amendment say anything about having to
be *in* a Militia.  But don't take my word for it, the Supreme
Court was pretty clear about it when they addressed this in 1939.
Nowhere, at all, did they find Miller's status as a private citizen,
no part of any organized militia, to be any impediment to his
Second Amendment standing.  The *only* criteria they felt worth
mentioning was whether the firearm in question was *suitable* for
militia use (and not whether it was possessed or used *in* a militia
context).

Let me clarify it for you by *not* rearranging the Second Amendment,
but instead simply substituting a few words:

   "A well educated electorate being necessary to the security
   of a free State, the right of the people to keep and read books
   shall not be infringed."

(Yes, I dropped two commas that seem to confuse people -- the
versions of the Second Amendment that floated around during the
time of ratification were sometimes printed with three commas,
sometimes with only the one I show above.  There is no "one true"
comma layout for the Second Amendment.  However, the Congressional
Research Service of the Library of Congress considers the
"one comma" version to be the form that was actually adopted.)

If the old phraseology is still confusing, bear in mind
that the opening clause would today be more likely rendered as,
"since a well educated electorate is necessary to the security
of a free state..."

Here, the meaning is quite clear -- the people, as individuals,
shall be secure in their right to keep and read books, so that
if/when they take part in casting their ballots as an electorate,
they will have a better chance of being educated enough to fulfill
their duties ably.

One would have to be way out in left field to try to use that
to claim that only people who were registered voters would
actually be able to keep and read books, and/or that people could
keep and read books only while in the voting booth.  And yet,
that's how anti-gun activists try to twist the Second Amendment.

The original intent of the Second Amendment was for the people,
as individuals, to keep and bear arms, so that if/when they
were called up for militia duty, they would be both armed
and familiar with the use of arms, which would help them to
be an effective militia instead of a bunch of unarmed, helpless
boobs.

Perhaps you're confused by the term "well regulated".  It
doesn't mean "heavily controlled by the government", it means
"effective", "properly functioning", "proper".  *None* of
the contemporaneous usage examples of "well regulated" in
the Oxford English Dictionary pertain to government
"regulation", *all* make sense only in the context of
"properly functioning":
   http://www.firstnethou.com/dcd/guns/oed.gif

Few dictionaries have an entry for the now obsolete term
"well regulated", but the few I've managed to find all
point to a meaning of "being what a thing should be",
for example:
   http://www.firstnethou.com/dcd/guns/dict2.gif

The Framers took the term "well regulated militia" from
the treatise "A discourse of government with relation 
to militias", by Scottish writer Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun.
Fletcher's "well regulated militia" was the armed body of
citizens *not* under the strict control of the central
government.

The meaning is entirely clear from the most widely
published introduction to the Second Amendment at the
time its ratification was being considered:

    "As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly
 before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces
 which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might
 pervert their power to the injury of their fellow-citizens, the
 people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep
 and bear their private arms."
 --Tench Coxe (1755-1824), writing as "A Pennsylvanian," in "Remarks
 On The First Part Of The Amendments To The Federal Constitution,"
 in the _Philadelphia Federal Gazette,_ June 18, 1789, p.2 col.1
 <<Coxe is referring to the proposed amendment which became the
 Second Amendment.>>

James Madison, author of the Bill of Rights, specifically
praised Coxe's summaries of the articles (including the
Second Amendment) which eventually became the Bill of Rights.
When the colonies ratified the Second Amendment, *this* is
what they understood they were agreeing to.

What part of "their private arms" is unclear?

Alexander Hamilton wrote directly on the subject of "well regulated
militias", and had this to say:

  To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes
  of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through
  military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary
  to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the
  character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to
  the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss. [...]
  Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the 
  people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; 
  and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be 
  necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year.
     --Alexander Hamilton, writing as "Publius," in
       the_Daily Advertiser,_ January 9, 1788

Note specifically that Hamilton says that what makes an armed
populace a "well regulated" militia is the "degree of perfection"
of their military ability, and that in his view the most
practical way to do that would be to assemble "the people at
large" once or twice a year in order to inspect them and 
ensure that they are "properly armed and equipped".

The Second Amendment is about armed *citizens*, who are
ready and able to defend themselves, their communities,
or their country if need be.  It's not about the "National
Guard", which is the very sort of federal force that
the founders wished to provide a check against if it
became a tool of a tyrant.

You don't have to agree with the wisdom of that, or
believe that it's relevant today, but please don't try
to twist its meaning.  The meaning is clear.
