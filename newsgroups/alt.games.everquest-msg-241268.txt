*shrug* That's fine, understandble even. Nothing to do with the

Not gonna 'make' them do anything. I specifically pointed out if it
was something they wanted they could do it in their offtime.

If you'll notice, they are quite similar to raid commands done now.

'Mini macros'? Interesting terminology. But really, the macros would
be robust enough to handle most contingencies. But you still program
in failure, you program in common mistakes. The easiest way to tell a
program from not is if it never gets anything wrong, always targets
the right mob, always works with split second effectiveness that no
human could duplicate. If a program is making the same mistakes humans
make, and even say cursing or apologizing when they fuck up(neither
the error nor the response to it is even remotely hard to program), it
will be mistaken for one. I guarantee it. Nobody would reasonably
expect a bot to a) make a mistake or b) apologize. That point is when
the magic happens and people begin to believe a set of 1's and 0's is
a human. Would it pass the Turing test? No. But if you are stupid
enough to let it be subjected to one you are as stupid as the magician
that lets you take apart his props. The point is not to make a program
that could pass as human by answering any question a human can give.
The point is to make a program that can be mistaken as human for the
duration of the time it is logged in while having scripts to perform
raid duties automatically given limited instruction. And with the
ability for there actually to BE a human responding at various times,
along with the myriad of programmed response scenarios that can be
factored in, the first part isn't even remotely hard.
