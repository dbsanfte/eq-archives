Breaking mez is either:
1) Taunt, Assist(!) to check target, repeat until it's you instead
of the Enchanter, Attack (your Stun will not overwrite the mez, I'm
not sure if it even adds hate),  OR
2) Taunt, Root, Attack, Stun, Taunt (if you're in a hurry for some
reason use Root to make sure, obviously not an option with unrootable
mobs, but very handy when the Warrior can't stand to not attack for
a few seconds).

I hate to admit it, but I have to agree with the passable crack.
There're an awful lot of crappy Paladins out there, so having even
half-a-clue can make you look good.

Otherwise, it's a lot of the same stuff you already know as a Cleric.
If there's no Cleric in the group, Symbol the Enchanter.  If the main
healer is a Druid, Symbol the Druid (as you doubtless know, a Druid's
leather armor amounts to double thickness tissue against the mobs you
fight post-50).  Doing this buys you more time to root or stun or gain
agro, just like it buys a Cleric time for a root/stun or a fast heal.

I haven't had a chance to play with group heals yet, so somebody else
will have to speak to their utility for healing in an AE or chaotic
battle, as well as their value as an agro management tool.

Stun and Root are your best combat magicks, use them liberally.  They
can control agro, and they can save the Cleric/Enchanter/Druid who you
are depending on to keep the group alive.  Lay Hands seems to be nearly
useless as a panic heal anymore, it seems the PC is always dead seconds
before you know he's about to die, so you have to be ready to use it
more deliberately.  The best use I've found for it lately has been to
tell the healer to not worry about me in an overpull/train situation,
I'll focus on helping with crowd control and heal myself if necessary,
the healer needs to watch the rest of the group.  It sucks tho, best
part of being a Paladin was always saving somebody else from imminent
death, can't really do that when you don't know they're in trouble
until it's already too late.
