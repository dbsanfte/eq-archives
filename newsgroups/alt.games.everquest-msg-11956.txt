Not to mention the fact that the Teir'dal are easier on the eye :)
My little dark elf shadow knight dinged 5 last night. She is strong
enough to carry weapons for all 5 melee arts and quite a bit of loot,
and she learns weapon skills much faster than my wood elf warrior -
they have the same dex of 88, but the dark elf has the edge in the
int/wis department. Her main problem is that she never really gets a
chance to practice bind wounds - I need to find her some bigger mobs
to beat on now.

One thing, though... what on earth makes someone walk up to a dark elf
who is holding a whip in her hand and ask her for buffs? I doubt it
was a Harm Touch he was looking for...
