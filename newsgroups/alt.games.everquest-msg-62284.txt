I was messing about in the Warrens the other day and a bard dragged me down
there to have a crack at it. 12 Draughts of Fire (all full hits for 653)
didn't visibly move its HP bar at all, so either a large number of HP or
uber regen. :)

I believe it's one of those mobs that isn't meant to be killed (like that
lowbie bear in GD) - it forms part of the SK quest for the Tunic of Riddosan
that starts in Paineel, you have to give the river source a jar of stuff to
poison the kobolds water supply.
