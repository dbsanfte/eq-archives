ICE!  haha how the hell are you.  I remember your picture on FA.
You're that big blonde guy who looks like a 30 yr old Stay Puff
Marshmellow Man with a tan.  Ya, I remember you now.

To answer your earlier question... I'm not back, just checking in from
time to time.  I've got this real annoying RL thing called a full time
job.  It puts a limit on the game play.  Kinda miss FA.  To bad MSN
Zone dropped that life time ban on me and my _YAF co-horts.  haha  I'm
a baaaaddddd man.  Didn't feel like re-formating otherwise you know
I'd be back in the skies.  Didn't feel like shelling out $10 a month
for that piece of rat infested shit they call FA 2.0 either.  Anyhow,
old news.

I'm PvP on EQ now.  Time to D-level and stir the pot like the good old
days.  Muhahaha!

-PS
