As will I.  That's the beauty of the free market system (capitalism).  So 
long as an end-user feels they are getting value for price, the vendor will 
charge a price that ensures profit or will discontinue the service.  The 
more profit, the happier the shareholders (again an end-user/vendor 
relationship).  I, for one, will gladly stay on as I still get a lot of 
enjoyment from the game.  While I would not pay $40 a month, ~$13 a month is 
still reasonable.

What gets me is the attitude that people have that they think that new 
development is "cheap".  Indeed, many folks seem to feel everything should 
be free for their own enjoyment [though that is not the intent of the 
original poster; just a sentiment I have seen floating around].  /shrug  
Myself, I do not mind paying money for value.  And if I think they are 
overcharging excessively, there are other activities from which I derive 
enjoyment.  People take these things either far too seriously *or* do not 
appear to have thought through what is going on from a business perspective.

Oh well, I guess I should be more tolerant in my old age and remember the 
Dilbert Principle.
