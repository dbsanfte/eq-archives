As in, only those that are AA ready can have more than 15 buffs???? I don't 
think I like that ... if ANYTHING those that are <51 can use the extra space 
for more buffs, 51+ buffs generally can be done with 1 spell instead of 3(my 
thought line here is like the shammy's HoS = 1hp buff + 1str buff + 1dex 
buff) ... Is SoE *losing* something if they just add more buff slots?  Is it 
in some way making people under 51st MORE powerful??? It doesn't make any 
sense to me ... and don't give me the "coding cannot be changed, so we have 
to do it this way" quote.  That is a bigger pile of hogwash.
