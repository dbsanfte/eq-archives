I think trains are more focused here, the mobs seem to be less distracted by 
bystanders and mostly ignore them unless they do something overtly stupid. 
Griefers aren't going to have as much fun here.

Was this your experience on FV? I can't recall ever running into any kind of 
griefing on FV. This is why I plan to play on a RP server at release. The 
difference in the player population is not subtle. May not be as true in 
CoH, but I see a definite difference in EQ and I'm hoping that effect will 
carry on in EQ2.
