When you die in those games you lose nothing. Although the death
penalty in SB is much less harsh then other games it is still too
harsh to treat it as an online FPS, it's not. When you die your
equipment loses durability which means your spending thousands of gold
to repair it. It might even break entirely if it was already damaged.
In addition you have to wait out your death shroud effect which can
accumulate if you die repeatedly over andover again. Then there is the
minor exp loss and most important the gold loss that you were
carrying.  

The players in beta agreed. It had first person view at one point long
ago and nobody used it because in pvp it was so restricting. When your
past level 20 and on the mainland Pvp can strike anytime. 

Two days ago for example my first pvp experience occurred when I was
in a group hunting in the desert near Khar. I am a Minotaur barbarian
so I play the role of main tank many times and at the very least am in
the front. One of our casters was resting regaining mana in the middle
of a cluster of healers and caster and ranged attackers.  Suddenly he
was attacked by a stealthed assassin class and died in two hits. Had I
and the other tanks been using fps view we never would have reacted
till the enemy was far far away. As it was we gave a chase of him and
almost caught him (we had low stamina from fighting mobs and I gave up
my speed increase for more melee resists at char creation.. Doh!). he
escaped but we did some serious damage before he did. 

While "gamekiller" might be too harsh the fact is fps view while
providing a more immersive environment will get you killed more often
and will not be used by the vast majority of players. Call it instead
a waste of resources that can be better spent elsewhere.
