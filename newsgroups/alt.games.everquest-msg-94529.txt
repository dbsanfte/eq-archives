Oohh, goodie... thanks Rastus ;o)

There is NO SUCH THING as 'camping a spawn'... if there's a MoB you're not
fighting, then it's fair game to all.

That said, however, if you've cleared a room/spawn and some asswipe wanders
by and sits on the spawn-point to draw first agro... LET HIM... then watch
him die. If he's too high for the spawn and can solo it easily, THEN you can
petition his ass for wrecking your groups XP. Otherwise you just have to ask
him politely to move on... using his name so that /report can pick up the
conversation... and if he refuses or talks trash back to you, then the whole
group should /report the conversation then /petition.

Calling a GM in to enforce a 'share' just means you'll get a 'rep' as a
whiner amongst the CSRs, which is why your petition takes 3+ hours to get
answered when other people are getting answers after only 20 minutes ;o)
