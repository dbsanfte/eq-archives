What does the existence of Diablo have to do with names in EQ?
Lucifer is a major character in judeo-christian mythology, thus
violating the naming policy.

Again, what does Xena have to do with names in EQ?  The existence
of a character on a TV show doesn't somehow grant an exemption
from the naming policy.

It's annoying and jarring to the necessary suspension of disbelief to
see 500 variations of Merlin, Raistlin, and Lucifer running around.
Not to mention stupid names like Uwanto Blomey, or whatever.
What's wrong with spending a teensy weensy little bit of mental
effort and coming up with an original name?
