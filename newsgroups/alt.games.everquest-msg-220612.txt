/assist off

Only need to type that once, it will be put in one of the config files.

There are some useful potions, particularly, some focus potions that 
stack with focus items.  Gate to bind potions are fairly popular, but, 
require a high skill level to make reliably, barely trivial to me at 191 
alchemy.

Get your LoY spell Stoicism, and Blood of Nadox.  Stoicism is a mini 
torpor, and blood of nadox is a group 19 counter poison and disease cure, 
will be handy in the future.

There are now curse DoT spells available for adventure points, as well as 
3 remove curse spells.
