At times I do forget that not everyone plays like me.  If you "play hard"
then mousing for anything other than mouselook and targeting is out of the
question as unacceptably slow.  "Socializers" (particularly socializer
bards) might find it better to use the mouse.  Better, not faster, because
if they wanted faster they wouldn't be playing that way.  =)

This I absolutely don't grasp at all.  It's exceedingly simple to customize
a UI to provide this functionality without crippling yourself by wasting
hotkey slots.  Hell, someone else has already done the work for you if you
hunt around.  Here's an example:

Not to mention that the bandolier has pretty much eliminated any need to
have weapon slots visible at all.

There are 10 whole banks of hotkey slots.  Shift-2, 2, shift-1 is still
faster than any mouse click.  Notice on the above screenshot, no "incoming"
button.  A button that a pulling monk will have to hit often and often
quickly, you can bet that I have one.  =) Notice also that the keys that are
hardest to hit with the left hand (FPS style, "wasd" and right hand
mouselook) aren't used.

While running head on at a raid of 50 people in the latest zones at high
resolution, even the best computer will look for an excuse to chug a bit. 
Mouse performance is always the first thing to suffer.  I am a hotkey
advocate *because* of the reliability issues, in addition to speed.
