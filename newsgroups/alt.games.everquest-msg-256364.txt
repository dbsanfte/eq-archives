Bob,
You are a bard. And when you are a bard you should only dual-weild weapons
that make a pretty whistling sound ;-)

Really though, it kinda depends on what you want to do.
To get your skill up faster, you should DW a faster weapon in your offhand,
so you get more swing attempts.
To maximize damage from your offhand, look for a weapon with a good
damage/delay ratio.  a 12/24 is better than a 14/32 for example.

Don't forget to train in many different kinds of weapons (1HB, 1Hpierce,
1HS), but remember if you have hopes of one day completing your bard Epic
Quest it results in a 1HS weapon.

Procs can be nice, but hardly reliable.  I keep a Truncheon of Doom for its
Slow proc, and a dagger that procs Band-aids, but I'll never turn down a
good slower and healer ;-)
