Vote early!

Vote often!

Vote Rhino!

The above used to be one of the slogans of the Rhino Party here in Canada.

So?  Separation of Church and State is there to prevent the government from
supporting a religion, not for preventing religion from supporting the
government.

Why should they be annoyed?  Least charitable view would be "Let the great
unwashed mass go mess up *their* place of worship; at least they're not
messing up *our's*.".

I think you have to admit, a satanic church would be appropriate as a venue
for voting in a government election.

Of course.  After all, you haven't figured in one possible reason - who pays
for the use of the building?  Federal building = federal payment.  School
building = state payment.  Fire hall = municipal payment.  Church building =
church payment.

Which are easier to find in the Excited States, Christian churches or
Buddhist temples?  They pick the thing that's easier to find.
