Eww, no offense, but those are newbie weapons... the BABS isn't quite as
bad, but it's far superior to the sarnak ceremonial sword or the axe of iron
back, the axe is better though before level 20 because of the damage cap,
but the sarnak sword is really crappy, LOW damage for a 2HS and delay that
doesn't give the damage bonus for 40+ delay.

get a Mithril 2-hander, 21/40 with haste on it is 21/31 or so, and still
gets the 40+ delay damage bonus, unless you have an FBSS or some other haste
item, then go for a Arbitors combine greatsword if you can afford it, or
else just stick with the BABS.
