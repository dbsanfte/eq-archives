Killing someone for no reason but because you can.

/shrug

It's quite clear to most people who play them. There's random ganking
(oldschool UO), and there's pvp for a purpose (say, DAoC or SB). DAoC
showed that its not "doomed to failure" at all.

If you don't understand the difference its a little clearer why you're
having so much trouble with this.
