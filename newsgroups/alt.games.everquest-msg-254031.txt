1HS will go up by itself quickly enough, if that's what you are 
primarily using.

Training points are virtually worthless. My high level characters have 
spent maybe 15 of them. (Earning 5 per level, yes, I have a couple 
hundred unspent points on each of them).

Skills that you obtain at higher levels need to be 'unlocked' by 
spending one point in the skill, once you reach the required level.

Other than that, there really is little use for training points.

So having said that, spend your points however you want, but make sure 
you keep one or two handy to unlock new skills.

If you want to make the most of your points, I'd stop spending them, and 
  then they'll be there when you need to raise a lagging skill, and you 
can blow 30 or 60 points into it to get it going. Ideally you'll rotate 
what weapons you use as you level to keep all your weapon skills 
maxxed... e.g. I carried a bag of various low-delay weapons of each type 
to work my skills up as I levelelled. I'd get my 5 points in 1HS, switch 
to 1HB get 5 points, swithc to 2HS... etc. Don't worry if you can't keep 
them all maxed at the early game, you just level too fast... but in your 
30s and 40s you'll be able to catch them all up and keep them caught up 
after that, as long as you aren't going out of your way to Powerlevel.

Good hunting.
