What is up with the moderates already :p If someone is beating you up do you
want them to slow down so that you reach a nice middle compromise? :)

If you must have a moderate quote at least use a good one .Moderation in all
things INCLUDING moderation :)

Notice though in his quote it is moral and religious. Moral is first and
thus was considered more important and religious does not bias against any
particular religion , which I beleive was also by design. In point of fact
there was at least one noted atheist among the throng that signed a few
documents. Sadly John Adams was right though. We lost moral somewhere along
the way and now it is considered normal and customary to plunder thy
neighbors to buy whatever we want.
