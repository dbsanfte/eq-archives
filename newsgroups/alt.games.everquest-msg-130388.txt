:-o Thank god I bought Luclin!

I saw those skills but I didn't really *look* at them, as I was busy at 
the time.

Hm.  "Finishing Blow" will be nice, as will "improved natural stamina" 
as I was stupid and didn't know sta was important (it's at 70 or so - I 
need 30 friggin points of sta just to get to 'decent' *weep*).

Thanks for the answer.  Now I REALLY want to get to 51.  *hops off to 
get to level 25*

Ryou
