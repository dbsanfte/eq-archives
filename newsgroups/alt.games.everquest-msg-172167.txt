	When I started my Ranger on Test, she ended up with a near-full suit
(minus the weapon) in maybe...two weeks?  Possibly less, and I didn't play her
that much.  This is without twinking (no help from higher-level people),
though I did trade Ruined Gnoll leather and chain bits I didn't need for ones
that I did.

	Yes, Giant Field Rat Whiskers suck.  As a Ranger, though, you can track
them at level 1.  Pity the Druids, who need them as well, and don't get track
until level 20.  If you don't see any Giant Field Rats on your tracking list,
find the closest Field Rat of any size and kill that.  Lather, rinse, repeat.
Clearing out the other rats will make the big rats spawn.

	The newbie armor quests are intended to keep you busy for quite a while.
The final bit (usually the weapon) is intended for level 15-20 characters,
though it goes without saying that on mature servers such characters can get
better weapons from other players.

	As for money: Siegliende, the aforementioned Ranger on Test, bought an axe
and a Qeynos Guard Shield from a vendor with cash earned hunting critters in
QHills.  She later on bought one of the Bogling Spears from a vendor, and then
a Crystal Grinder from a PC in the bazaar, all with coin earned from looting
in QHills/Blackburrow.  Newbie cash loot has been increased dramatically since
the good ol' days; most of the bits for those quest armors sell for gold, and
a few parts (like Plague Rat Tails) sell for platinum.
