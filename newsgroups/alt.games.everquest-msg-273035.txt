I'll tell ya why I don't like it when people make inferences.

Believe it or not, I don't care if anyone believes me on this.

I meet people off line who seem fairly normal, I mean that in a nice
way. But they don't like anything their 'icons' don't like. They
will ask anyone they don't like what appears to be a innocuous
question. Ya answers with a yes or no. Evidently they have
pre-prepared rants based on either answer. They start out calmly
informing the person who answered the innocuous question by telling
them that if they believe that, they must believe a whole list of
things. When you deny the reply to the first question couldn't imply
all or any of those things, they start ranting. Things like asking
me if played d&d anytime in my life. I have. So then they go on and
on about how that implies a whole list of bizzare things, like my
politics, that they are wrong on. Then they start shouting how I am
dangerous to some bizzare notion they have. People who watch a
certain televangelous show on tv or listen to certain radio
demagogues. What set the guy off ? He claimed I was a liberal
because I believe in separation of church and state.  Then he told
me the Constitution has to go, for the good of America.

So, I don't believe saying one thing implies a list of other things.

If someone else does, then thats up to them. But don't put that onto
me.
