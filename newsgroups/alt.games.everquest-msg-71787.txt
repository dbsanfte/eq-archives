Shadowhaven soulbinder is located right next to the pad in from and back
out to Nexus.  This means that anyone can now get to a Spire, port up,
pad over, bind, and be 15 minutes from any continent in the old world.  Of
course Antonica is a bit silly to go to at low levels, one heck of a long way
from anywhere to hunt.  And DL is even worse... a spire in LOIO would
have been much handier.  Still, GFay and Tox means even rediculously low
levels have very viable self port and bind to near alternative hunting zones.
