It is not that awesome, just crusader gear. I've got quite a few pristine
maple boxes and a heap of raw materials I was going to process until i found
out everything i make seemed to rely on coral, and i could never find the
damn stuff, and i can't afford a gold piece for a shot at a tradeskill. I'm
hoping to get WOW this week but the shops locally are totally focussed on
xbox etc so it might take a trip. EQ2 i ended up getting through mail order,
and even then they stuffed it up and it was a week late, so I'd rather buy
from a shop.

Anyone know a shop in sydney with it in stock? And the approx price?

I've really gotten tired of pick up groups. This arvo I joined up with an 18
cleric and a 16 sorcerer in blackburrow. The latter didn't seem able to
speak english, and the cleric wanted us to jump down to the bottom from the
bridge. I pointed out I didn't know the zone and wanted to fight down but
the cleric was insistant. Ok, got to the bottom, and the cleric invited a 20
druid, which worried me as eq2 level ranges are extremely narrow. Something
attacked (I couldn't see it, and my questions were ignored) and the next
thing i know the druid gated out, the cleric is dead, the sorcerer is either
ignoring me or unable to understand english, and I'm fighting all by my
lonesome. Almost made it too, but soloing white ++ mobs is not recommended.

So everyone but the druid dies, the druid disbands, then the cleric does and
starts shouting for a new group, and i revive and make my painful way back.
The sorcerer dies enroute to BB and ignores my questions some more about
what he was fighting. Great, more xp debt. I get to the bridge, and explain
to the sorcerer a few times that i can't see us fighting our way out after
we jump down to our shards, so i think the best thing is to gate out after
and disband rather than start all over again from the bind point (a long
boring run from graystone), but he doesn't get it, so i give up, get shard,
get mended, port out, log out, and call a few shops to find out they don't
have WOW either.

So yes, you can have my stuff, i'd even give you my character if there was
an easy way to do so, although with the measly 4 slots allowed that could be
a problem.
