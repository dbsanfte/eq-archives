    Now that the quests are fixed Iksar are just a hoot to play. They're the
first race where you get guild quests that start low and finish quite high,
like Soulfire does.

    That's because most twink Iksars never bother doing the class quests. I
found that out with my monk - I'd ask all the top Iksar monks I knew about
the bracer quests, and they'd have NO clue about them.

    Most high level SKs I see are Trolls and Iksar, with a few Teir'Dal and
Humans. Erudite shadow knights are rare, and at least on my server there's
almost NO Ogre SKs (I only know of one, and he's pre-Kunark and mostly goes
around in Teir'Dal form). Iksar have the best AC once they hit the Velious
armour levels (and even before, given how rare Blood Ember armour is for
twinking), and people seem to enjoy playing them.
