PSU's are "about it" until you spend 30-40k? How about knuckle dusters?
Fighting batons? Bear hide gloves? Cane of the tranquil? Mudman enforcer?
You *do* know how to use the bazaar search facility, don't you? 30-40k is
more than enough to set you up with all your equipment needs up to the point
where upgrades are no drop high end stuff.

The ABS is known as the giant killer for a reason. Get to the max melee
distance, and you won't get hit. As a beastlord it's even easier, once it
procs, back up - the pet will keep the mob in one place. Get your MR up high
enough, and it won't be a problem.

Monks have never been known for range damage. Once you have the mob's
attention, it's done it's work.

Might as well complain that the monk doesn't get ports and dots, while
you're at it.

FD flopping is almost as good as hide & sneak. Never had a problem on corpse
retrievals for anyone. Monks have evade too. Just set up a macro to attack
off, FD, Stand, attack on. Mend works every time once the skill goes over
100, which is by the time you are level 19.. It's saved my life many, many
times, and has made the difference between having to FD and finishing the
fight. As for a 30hp heal, what do you think bandages are for? At 20, you
will be healing up to 26hp a bandage (assuming you've worked on bind wound).
That plus the mend takes you to 75% health, or higher if you bind up to 50%
without your hp gear, put it on, then mend. Can your rogue do that?

Why compare a pet class with a pure melee? It seems you are happier with
your rogue and beastlord, but are annoyed by the monk because FD & mend
aren't working, and you aren't putting out the same amount of damage, but
are only weilding PSUs. Max out FD & mend, get a couple of fighting batons
(25pp each) and out a couple more levels under your belt. . Pair up with a
druid or a shaman - both awsome combos. Pair up with a necro/sk/ranger and
do some fear kiting.

Take the lead and start your own groups - lo and behold, there's a monk in a
group. Get people used to having a monk around. Every time I use the LFG
tool, there's maybe 2-3 groups looking for players, but at least 50 players
looking for groups. I can only attribute it to laziness than any one of
those players doesn't start a group and invite those other players. Take a
look next time - how many groups can you make out of all those players LFG?
And don't fall for the trap of believing "you need a full group for the xp
bonus" - you may get 20% extra for a full group, but it's still split 6
ways - 20% each. If you only have 2 in your group, it's 51% each. Once a
group has enough players to bring a constant stream of mobs down with
little/no downtime, that's how big the group needs to be.

I might go and start a monk on your server, for when Innoruuk is down for
"emergency maintenance" again ;-)
