Leather graphic leggings will still give her the thong look (tizmak
and ulthork will cover her up, but only in non-luclin velious
graphics). I recommend chain or plate armor: if she worships Tunare,
she can wear imbued elven chainmail, if not, she can wear enchanted or
plain elven chainmail. This is made by high elf smiths.
Plate armor: black or brown chitin leggings.
