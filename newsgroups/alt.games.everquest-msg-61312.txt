<SNIP>

I had the same thing happen to my 26, then 27th lvl Rogue at my
friends house. Both times I dinged I hit my inventory button and
crashed to the desktop. Then when I came back in after hitting 27, I
looked at my xp bar and it said I had 4 yellows and 4 blues into 27. I
made one kill and it changed to where I only had 1 blue. Sometimes
this game is such a tease.
