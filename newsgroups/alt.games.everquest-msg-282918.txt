Yes, on EQTrader it was mentioned the multi-dose system was permantly
discontinued so people can't exploit it by selling 1 charge left for
big refund.  Old 10 dose gate pot usually sold in bazaar for 2700-3000
and can be sold regardless of the remaining charge for just under 2k,
netting as much as 9 gate for less than 1k total.  The dev (Ngreth
specifically) wanted to make sure people paid about 220 (can't
remember exact amount but just over 200) per gate as intended with the
old gate pot so new pot are single dose only.

They stack to 20 so you could have 20 gate in one slot where the old
10 dose were not stackable.
