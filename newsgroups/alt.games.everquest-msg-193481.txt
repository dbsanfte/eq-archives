The biggest weak spot is the GF MX card.  Why get all that power & use a
weak video card?  I would back off on the CPU & get at least a GF ti4200.

At a quick glance at the prices I think I could build that machine for about
850 to 900 dollars.  Are you SURE that you are getting a motherboard with an
AGP slot & not integrated video?
