I just picked this game up on a friends suggestion.  Well, 1st
impression is that for 2001 the graphics suck.  And I was told this is
better then Diablo 2. I highly doubt it.  Maybe the total playable land
space you can go around in is better but the graphics are so square and
blocky its a pain to look at for long periods of time.

I created a char. and now I am looking for a web site or FAQ somewhere
to get me familiar with the fighting system, controls, etc...

Anyone know of any?

TIA

KID
