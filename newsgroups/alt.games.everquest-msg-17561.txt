Hi everyone,

I'm fairly new here, just wondering if anyone might have some information
they could share with me regarding rangers and bows at low levels.

I have a 3rd level ranger character and I've managed to obtain a bow.
However I notice that arrows seem to be quite expensive and at this level I
have found I won't be making enough of a return to warrant using them ( this
could just be inexperience here ). I am thinking that maybe it is best to
start using bows at later levels with this class after learning fletching?

If anyone has any recommendations regarding this I'd really appreciate it!
