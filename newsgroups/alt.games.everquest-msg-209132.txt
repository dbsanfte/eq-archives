I am pretty sure that those four are _not_ actually being sorted by
population.  Probably another piece of SOE's camppaign to deny market
research data to the competition (that was their justification for
removing the population numbers and disabling the "count" parameter
from /who, remember?).  Also, I think we can take the still open $50
for all characters from one server _with_their_possessions_ transfer
offer as an indicator that the Ubisoft servers are nowhere near "full".
(Standard character transfer being 2 characters for $50 and no gear.)

FV is not the ultra low population server it used to be, very probably
(IMO) because they removed the "alignment" system and mostly mitigated
the language barrier.  As I've mentioned elsewhere, I think they could
easily fill a "new" server that was no-transfer and one character per
account (ala FV) so long as they left out the TLC and the (pointless)
language restrictions.
