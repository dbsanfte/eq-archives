    I feel for paladins. Never mind the history of weak spells, weak drops
and XP penalties that have only recently started to be fixed. The QUESTS
that paladins had to do have historically been god-awful hassles compared
with any other comparable class quest. Ro armour, Soulfire, even your first
quest spell compared with the quest spells for the other hybrids - just
brutal.
