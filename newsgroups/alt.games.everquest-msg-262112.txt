Interesting. Glad you got your axe.

The first time I encountered Praklion was during the anniversary events. I
was doing the scavenger hunt with another person from my guild. We zone into
Dagnor's, and a group is fighting him right at the zone line. I managed to
get out with about 50% of my hp left, and they got out with about 40% of
theirs. I think I got hit by the `whirl' proc twice.

Iirc, the group fighting it got wiped and had to wait for the respawn, but
we both managed to get in and get the quest item fairly quickly after the
fish went back in the water or despawned.

Pulling an epic mob to a zone line is a bad idea if its got a short
entrance/exit, like Dagnor's-Butcherblock.
