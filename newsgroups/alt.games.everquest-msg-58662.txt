 The druids at the WC ring are annoying since they aren't on the normal
druid faction. Unless there's another druid faction somewhere I'd have
to say they aren't druids but are rather rangers. Actually, considering
they shoot their annoying little arrows at me all the time, I'm fairly
certain they are rangers. 

 If you kill enough gnolls you can safely hang around druids in
NK/EK/Surefell. Does anyone know anything that increases your faction
with Rangers?
