Got another LDoN group today, the LFG tool's work, as I set it
and got multiple invites within 5 minutes despite being a
relatively low demand class as I understand it; and there were
people calling out LFG LDoN in the same zone as me to no avail.

At any rate, after some mess with crashing out, I got to the
group in EC tunnel, they added me as 6th man, quickly picked a
collection mission, and off we went to NRo.  I of course LD'd
again heading there... and when I got back on and contacted the
leader (who's name I'd written down, used to the LD problems by
now) I found they were already inside, someone had zoned in
accidentally.  So I followed my blue line quite a long ways
across NRo, its a big zone with no SOW or Selos, been a long time
since I crossed it on foot.  Anyway I found out why someone had
zoned in accidentally, as following the blue line I too just
zoned in without ever seeing a threshold.

Dungeon name was Arena of Chance.

Group was SK, Warrior, shaman, cleric, enchanter, mage (me).  I
was, however, the lowest level member, at 36, we ran up to 39, a
fairly tight cluster.

Basically a collection mission is a high speed killing mission;
we had to get 23 "clay totem" to drop, and they drop random off
any mob.  So we wandered around killing everything that moved in
as large a quantity as we could.  Minibosses popped, you can tell
them because their names begin in caps like "Brawny Posession"
instead of something like "Brawny posession."  Three augments
dropped, int +3, cha +3, and sv cold +3, also a pair of shoulders
for chain+classes and a pair of gloves for int casters; the
latter two items were droppable, we had to roll off the augments
since they were no drop even on Firiona Vie.

Despite having 3 low DPS classes in the group, we had no trouble
chewing up mobs and only stopped for a brief med break a couple
times, I tended to drop exactly one nuke per mob, which is
sustainable, and only went into the hole when we'd overpull and
I'd end up nuking in really close succession plus casting DS on
the MT; even then I'd get no lower than 50% and could skip nuke
on the "easy" mobs the next few rounds till I caught back up.

I did not see a message for mission completion, but eventually it
was indeed over.  We ran back to the exit to make sure the tanks
got out safely, did end up fighting some scavengers but I
understand they are triggered.  Back in NRo, ran to the tunnel to
EC and then to the wayfarer camp, where I checked altV and saw
I'd completed the mission and recieved 3 points for it.

At any rate, I got a cash split of around 45pp (43pp plus change)
and then got the gloves since nobody else wanted them.  Replacing
my gnewbie quest gloves, they are an upgrade, on my Morel Thule
wing of the account no character I've ever run would have been
seen dead in the things even at level 20, but on Firiona Vie,
they are a nice upgrade indeed... the only item I own other than
my mage pet focus shovel and stien that's worth more than a plug
copper.  I could probably buy better for 100pp, of course, but
thats mudflation for you.

SO, I could have made better cash in any number of ways, some
exp, others not... but what is better, I also made 3 yellow in an
hour; if I could chain several missions like that in a row it
would be some of the best leveling in the game.  Good exp and
decent loot at the same time, plus 3 points which can be earned
no other way, plus the fun of a real dungeon crawl without repops
or competition... hard to beat that with a summoned stick.

Splendid One, 36 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
