True, however nothing lights a fire under your arse better then someone
trying to take your market share eh?

  I have a question:  DAoC, AoL, etc are new "second gen" (Sg) mmorpg's with
fairly impressinve engins. Do you think EQ would have updated there engine
if these games didnt come to be? I realy dont think they would have. I am
happy they did and if they didnt I wouldnt not eaven consider Lucin. They
did though and this should enhance the playing expierance of EQ and its
competative eadge, with the later being the motivational aspect of the whole
project.

Same thing with Half Life, make xpac (blue shift isnt xpac, but damn close),
include "Engine enhancements" to make the out dated product sell. Dont get
me wrong I have a blast in HL and EQ, but the point remains.
