Lets assume mob is lvl 22.  Xp per mob is lvl^3 * zone modifier * group
bonus.

Assume zone mod of 1, avg outdoor zone.
Group Bonus for party of 2 is small, maybe 5% (don't know off hand)

Xp = 10648 + 5% = 11180.4

Lvl 20 gets  11180* 20 / (20 + 23) = 5199.8
Lvl 23 gets  11180* 23 / (20 + 23) = 5980.6
