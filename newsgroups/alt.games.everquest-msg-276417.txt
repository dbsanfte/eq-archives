A true SOE solution again,give all classes better solo abilities in a
M*MULTI*PORPG to compensate for the diminishing player base,
instead of rethinking the group dynamics aka solve the "group
looking for slower" problem.
As it wasnt bad enough before OoW,they intensified the problem
with average xp mobs hitting harder again.
OoW was the worst expansion ever,brought nothing new except
higher numbers,have a look at the 66+ spells,its all about higher
numbers,unlike the last expansion which raised the level cap,at least
some PoP spells brought some new utiliies and fun toys.
They even managed to make Enchanters unhappy with OoW by
"nerfing" their charmed pets,a hearty congrats on this to SOE,
it sure took some time and afford to achieve this.

What EQ needs is that every group composition can achieve the same
than any other group composition,get rid of the group lf healer or
slower crap.
