Okay.  I sold a bunch of silk.  Even bought some low priced silk and turned
around and sold it at full price (5pp).  Made a mistake on some purchases
(deity issue), but got them resold and got a bunch of new equipment.  My
wizard is now stronger, quicker, sturdier, smarter, wiser, has extra mana
and hit points, better armor, better weapon, and mostly better resistances.
Cool.

However, it seems I don't get the same experience I was getting before I
bought all this stuff.  Wandering Greenbloods don't give me experience with
each kill.  Only occasionally (1 in three, last night).  Does all this
equipment change how the game awards experience, or was this some sort of
abberation?

Cheers,
Eric
