Heh, if it is a begger, I'd be more than happy to give.  Alot better than
the guy that just hails you and says "U got a weapon for me"

My guess is, he's a non-twink who lost his corpse, and just wants back what
he had.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
