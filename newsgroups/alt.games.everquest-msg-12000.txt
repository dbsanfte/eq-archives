The only solution is to turn the Frogloks into a playable race - give
them a town off Upper Guk (and Lower Guk for their evil classes) and
put the Shin Lord in the town. Of course, you kill a few placeholders
in Upper Guk and he will pop up there having 'run' from the town to
beat up the instigators of all this trouble...

Think about it - Froglok Paladins, Froglok Monks, Undead Froglok
Necromancers! Oh yeah! Only problem is - Id spend my whole time with
the camera facing toward my character, so Id could watch him run. I
love the way those buggers run! Anda  Froglok Monk? Ha - imagine
seeing those crazy little fellas doing the spin kicks and all? Hoo
hah!

Playable Frogloks now!
