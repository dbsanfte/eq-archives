I played with this with a newbie bard on one account
and my mage (of all things) on another.  Have the
bard weave CoD and Hymn, with Shield of Lava (or
better, Cadeau of flame) and he shot up.

The druid makes this WAY easier.  HP buff/heal
means that the bard just has to play an AE damage
song.  Not sure how many he'll be able to take at
48 - I'd try bloodgills - 2 at a time.
