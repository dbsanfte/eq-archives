Better hurry up before the VI funslayers take that ability away. In the
name of helping simian players everywhere NPC's will give back items they;'re
"not interested in". This will be sold as helping players who accidentally
give their items away, although its probably more to do with NPC's being
too dumb to actually rate what they want to wear and wield.

Anyway. It will mean no more dressing up mobs or giving them pretty toys for
the newbies to find, just like when they stopped me giving all my coin to
fire beetles.

Bastards.

Sui, still a VAK ;)
