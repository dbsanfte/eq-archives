Arrgh!  Druids would not have such good AC and melee if they were not meant to
hit!  Some tell me to not even worry about AC or STR, because after 20, I won't
use it!  I'm after 20, I still use it, and it comes in extremely useful.

In a group situation, a druid should be in there slashing AND casting.  It
doesn't do as much dmg as the warriors most of the time, so the mob won't turn
on it.  If it does, just STEP OUT!  As long as the druid keeps a good eye on
the health bars, gives sows, snares, roots, buffs, etc when needed, it can be
up there doing twice as much dmg as it normally would if it's meleeing!  Every
few fights, it would just sit back and med.
