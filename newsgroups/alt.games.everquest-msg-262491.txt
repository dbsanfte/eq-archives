Are you talking about corporate welfare?  Oh, that's right, nobody
ever talks about that, even though it's just as big a problem as
personal welfare...  (Not directed at you personally, I just want
other readers to keep in mind that corporate welfare is a problem that
is perhaps as big as personal welfware.  It also needs to be
recognized as discussed.)

Then maybe you should write George W. Bush a letter telling him you're
unhappy with his plan to make all the illegal Mexicans in America
legal United States citizens.  The vast majority of them would
probably qualify for welfare.

Besides the fact that It's Just Plain Wrong to reward people for being
here illegally.  Talk about "sending the wrong message", something
George W. Bush accuses Kerry of over and over...and over and over...
And over and over and over and over and over and over...  (Since he
doesn't have any original thoughts in his head, all he can do is mount
baseless attacks.)

I agree that, at some point, people have to take responsibility for
themselves, and that includes getting healthcare.  However, there are
also a lot of children out there who didn't ask to be born and can't
take care of themselves.  They deserve some kind of minimum level of
healthcare if their parents can prove they can't provide it.

I'll never understand why Clinton was burned at the stake for
suggesting such a thing might actually be the ethical thing for the
wealthiest nation on the planet to do.

I'll also never understand how republicans can be "pro life" and
anti-welfare when children are at stake.  What, we can't abort them,
but once they're born, if their parents can't feed them, we should let
them starve to death?  Or we should let them die of some illness or
medical condition that is easily solved because their parents don't
have healthcare for their kids?

Talk about a logical disconnect.

> the Right to an education,

You have to be careful with this one.  A well educated citizen becomes
an asset to a country.  The monies used to educate him or her can
often be the best investment a country can make.

I agree with you, but these aren't the black and white issues they
might seem to be, either, as I've demonstrated above.
