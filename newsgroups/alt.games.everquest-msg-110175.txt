1.  Max wisdom on what ever race you choose as a shaman. Always max
wisdom. No other stat really matters except agil, which must be at
least 75 or you take an ac penalty. Dex does not help casting, no
other stat affects casting.

2. Max wisdom.

3. Max wisdom.

4. Make sure agil is at least 75, I believe that if you are checking
that as a shaman and if its NOT 75 then you are an ogre. I don't think
any other class starts below 75.

5. Possibly put the rest of the points into stamina, though really
stamina won't even give you very many more HP if you put all the rest
of your points into it on any shaman race. 10 more stamina than what
you start with is like 30 more hp at level 60.. yay. When you are a
shaman and you have big ass focus and sta buffs, 30 hp is kind of
meaningless. 

6. The only other thing that might matter for stats, is charisma when
you are low level to help buy food and spells. Its really no worse to
throw away points on charisma as it is on any other stat that makes no
difference as a shaman. Shamans can buff the piss out of charisma
also.

Rather than babbling on about stats for hours, this guide is pretty
much dead on :

http://eq.castersrealm.com/creationguides/Shaman.asp

Max wisdom on any race, make sure agil is high enough, go from there.
As long as your agil is 75 though, I'd not bother adding to agil like
they say. It does basically nothing for AC to dump 5 points on agil,
plus you get an agil buff as a shaman anyway (the best agil buffs)

Another addition to their guide, If a troll make sure innoruk is your
god. That lets you get the Dark elf Regent neck thing eventually
(quested in neriak) which is 7 ac, 3 wis, 15 mana and right clickable
clinging darkness. My 39 twinked dark elf cleric still uses this and
its one of my favorite items. It is 

HUM DEF TRL, CLR SHM : innoruk (must be innoruk diety)

With the stats being okay (except wis a bit low, but oh well), that
neck thing, the JBB or whatever armor and 260 dd thing that iksars
can't use, 2x the regen of other shamans (along with iksar), it makes
a very good arguement for troll for me.

My other choice is Vah shir just because having racial sneak makes the
vah shir have the best way to get quests/sell and buy stuff from
vendors/npcs who don't like it. No other shaman gets sneak, that is
pretty cool. Remember that shamans don't get an invis until level 29
so it makes that even more of an advantage. Besides that, like the
barbarian, vah shir is both medium AND large sized as far as armor.
They have the same OR better factions as Barbarians (to good factions,
they are still just as KOS to evil(def, ogre, troll, overthere),
though they are only apprehensive to the East freeport dismal rage
sewer people)
