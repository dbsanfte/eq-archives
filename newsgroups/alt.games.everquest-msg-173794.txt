A good point system will be neutral , the raid points generated will exactly
equal the cost of the equipment acquired from the raid. This will guarantee
that the lesser follower always gets his share. One of the best ways to make
this happen is a bidding system.

If you just want to protect the causal gamer a system that works well is the
master list. Keep a list of everytime someone is awarded loot and when
multiple people ask for an item the person who asked that has gone the
longest time without an item is awarded it . This completely protects the
person who can only play sometimes will penalizing slightly the person who
comes and helps all the time.

Full random is ,well random . One guy might get nothing and another 15
upgrades. This is usually thought of as a bad thing (tm).
