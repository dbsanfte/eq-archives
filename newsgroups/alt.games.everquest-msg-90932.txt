Well, I think you got it the wrong way round. Dying at level 10 can be a
"slight annoyance" The higher you go the less of a "slight annoyance" it
becomes, and more essential that you don't die, particularly when you just
DINGED, or you're stuck in a hell level where exp seems to drag and you lose
2 blue bubs of exp if you die
Dont worry bro. When your fighting six mobs in Karnor you will get plenty of
adrenalin rush, even if when you know that your cleric will do complete
heal, or if that fails a full, or near full rez.. Seeing your hp bar dip
below the single bub mark will get yer heart pumping, no probs.
