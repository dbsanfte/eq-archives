That's a fact, and exactly why I called it. We've done Royals before,
but it was long ago. The people we had for leaders back then who really
knew the raid have since retired or moved on to other guilds. Lack of
experience is a killer there. Also, it was a Friday night raid, and a
huge slice of our "A" team was not online. We had three monks for
pulling, but two of them were only low fifties. (Last time we had a very
experienced pair of sixty monks, I recall quite clearly, and they split
everything for good pulls so it went like "buttah"). The whole thing was
jinxed from the start, really. The rogue thing was the funniest. Our
more experienced rogues weren't around, but a new rogue we just
recruited was there.  I honestly didn't even give her level any thought.
She was *ANON* ferkristsakes. What rogue goes /anon???

We get the prince door, she tries it, and proclaims she can't open it.
(She's 47 it turns out. Has a skill of 200.)  Thank god one of our
master craftsmen was there. A druid ran quickly to pick up some supplies
and got CoTH'd back down and she made a magical lockpick thingy and the
rogue was able to open the door.

In hindsight, I almost wish we hadn't had the lockpicks and just left at
that point.
