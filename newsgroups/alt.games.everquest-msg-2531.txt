Ah, thanks.  That's just the nudge I was looking for.  As for North Ro,
logic would dictate I get a bind somewhere closer than Grobb.  Not
having been to Freeport with a Troll or a SK, can I/should I bind
somewhere there?  Neriak seems about as far away from N Ro as Grobb is,
and that's the only other nearby spot I know of where I can bank/sell/train.
