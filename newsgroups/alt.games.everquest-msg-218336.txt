People get annoyed at others who refuse to follow conventions not because of
petty reasons like efficiency, but because of a natural aversion to assholes
who think they are special. If I see someone break ettiquite or conventions
I normally don't give a hoot. As soon as I see someone state they know the
conventions but have decided they are too special to follow them - I pretty
much plonk straight away.

It is an information overloaded world we live in. You can safely squelch out
huge tracts of sources and still not be left wanting for information or
communication.
