Well, if we take a look at a practical example, even approximations should
reveal the truth. At level 32 with 124 wis I cast sow continuously at 40
mana per shot for 25 times before running out of mana. That is equivalent to
a mana value of 1000.
So, for example, if we take:

option a) 1 point of wisdom/intelligence is worth 10 mana, then I would have
a mana value of 1240, which is too high.

option b) mana=level*(2+(wis or int*.02)) gives approx 32*4.48 = approx. 144
which is far below the amount that I used

option c) mana=level/5*wis or int gives approx 32/5*124 = 794 which is below
the amount that I used

So, it looks as if none of them are correct.

A second example was when I was in my late 20's and wanted to up my
divination. I cast Sense Animals, with a mana value of 5, continuously and
up'd my skill level approximately 5 times per bubble at one increase per 5
or 6 casts.  So this would give a mana total of 5 (bubbles) x 5 (skill
increases) x 5 (mana) x 5.5 (casts per skill increase) = approx 688. I had a
wis of 105 at the time and I was around level 28. This is more approximate
than the first example but here goes:

option a) would give mana value of 1050, which is too high

option b) would give a mana value of approx 115, which is far too low

option c) would give a mana value of approx 588, which is below what I used.

Although the figures for my second example are less accurate than the first
example (I may have been lvl 27, I may have cast a bit more/less) the
results are consistent with the first example (i.e. they are as wrong as in
the first example) so I would again say that none of the formulas are
correct.
