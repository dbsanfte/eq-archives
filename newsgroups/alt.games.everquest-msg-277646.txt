Q: Will I now own EverQuest II characters, items and/or coin?

A: No.  The User Agreement and Software License, to which you agreed
when you installed the game and to which you agree every time you
launch the game, makes it clear that you have no ownership rights in
characters, items and coin -- what you have is the right to use them in
accordance with the license agreement, the rules of conduct of the
game, and SOE's terms of service.  When SOE launches Station Exchange,
SOE will permit you to "sell" and "buy" that right to use characters,
items and coin.  In "lawyerese," you will be buying and/or selling a
limited license right, not an ownership right.

Thus SOE could still, if they really wanted to, ban those who use IGE
for selling and buying rights to items and characters that they have no
authority to.  Not that I'm expecting them to.  I don't play any SOE
products at this time, and who knows when I will again...but I am glad
that they are at least starting this service on completely new EQ2
servers and allowing free transfers.  And speaking as someone who
recently gave his EQ character to an RL friend to 2-box with, if this
results in a sanctioned way to carry this out at least something good
will have come of it.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
