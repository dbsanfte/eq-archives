the one you kill somebody in Icewell for, and hand it in to the guy in Kael)

Read again :)   Direct damage 3.. ie the focus effect (the hat from CT maze,
mask of the dragonslayer etc).. Ft3 boots.. ie the boots of flowing slime,

seconds before his death.  On the contrary, my wizard has maxed defensive
skills, and offensive skills for his level - which I owe to PL
