If everyone else was doing it it wouldn't work.

I fail to see how putting it beneath a hyphen or two makes a 
difference... and...

(f) Posting your referral link in places where it is not welcome, or 
spamming your referral link online in any capacity is strictly 
prohibited. If we see or receive complaints about your referral methods 
that we deem risky, we may place your account or accounts on hold. 

So... No ipod for you!

I don't usually use a sig, but you've inspired me... from now on all of 
us (I don't see why I should be the only one benefitting from this) 
should suffix all of our posts with something along these lines:

PS I want a lot of stuff for free, but for some incomprehensible reason 
nobody has organized a freesite to get it, and rather than get out there 
and create millions of annoying sites how about you all just send me 
some cash?  I think $10.00 per person ought to do it. I'll stop asking 
for money when I have enough! Feel free to send extra and often to help 
me get there.
