Alas, but it's not surprising. I received a contrary answer in our community
of Firiona Vie and yet I felt compelled to ask here because, well, because I
find many opinions here more reliable.

Aye, so it works much the same here as it does in other worlds I've visited.
Good to know, I'll keep that in mind as I continue to smell the roses and
occasionally succumb to the temptation to go out and solo while Summerbreeze
is elsewhere.

What I've since learned in additional experimenting is that it is a display
issue. Health is increasing (my Light Healing at level 17 heals 32 hp), but
my wife's Warrior has enough HP so that 32 hp doesn't necessarily register
on her magical red bar. This may actually support the mammoth tusk theory,
but at least I have an answer now.

Aye, I looked forward to training that one point when the season came.
Meditation has naturally risen to the skill cap every season without doing
anything. With the change in how the spell book now operates, I wondered if
it made a difference to have it in my face. I'm glad it does not.

Disappointing. I remember in a past life I lived the life of a Rogue and
felt much the same about the new Poison capabilities introduced just prior
to my departure. I understand the situation's changed somewhat since,
perhaps something similar will happen for Shaman.

Thanks, hope to see you on the battlefield!
