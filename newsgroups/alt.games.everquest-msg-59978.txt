Well, you're a shaman, not a cleric.   Clerics tend to be able to take
quite a bit more of a beating, for one thing.   I've still got the hotkey
in the bank, though.  I just haven't had much need to use it.   Oh, I
know *when* I'll use it:  someone's going to die if this mob doesn't
stop beating on me.   Surprisingly enough, that's usually not me that's
on death's doorstep, though.

A druid (and to some extent a shaman) being primary healer is a
lot different than a cleric in at least the obvious case:   that cleric
is a plate class.   A druid has to yell pretty quickly for help because
they'll die if they don't get separation.   A cleric shouldn't have to
yell as quickly and, IMO, it's screams "noob" just as loudly as "help."
I've found it a lot more effective to calmly say "You might want to
taunt this off me if you want me to heal you" than scream my
"NOT IN THE FACE!! NOT IN THE FACE  GET THIS OFF ME!!!!"
macro.  YMMV.

The other thing is to get used to playing crowd control for yourself.
If I'm agro'd, I'm a lot more likely to root it and step out-of-range,
even in dungeons, than scream for help when I notice no tank is
switching targets.
