Are you refering to the board the MB poster named Boxcar Willy set up?  
Anyways, 100% (or nearly so) public arenas are *always* going to have a
fairly putrid signal/noise ratio than a more restrictive venue.  However
a board by and for uber bored with ph4ming quarm and beating Uqua blind
folded with both hands tied behind the back using the zen-master nose on
keyboard technique aren't really going to be either aware or sensitive to
the less uber concerns. :)

That said, for your average random pickup group perception *is* reality
and when folks start perceiving monks and paper tank gimp dps why use 'em
to pull when bard/cleric/chanter can do it faster, well monks get replaced.

Same thing happened to warriors in PoP and early LDON when snap agro and
agro-lock was deemed *necessary*.  As a war who lived thru that time I
don't have much compassion for the current batch of Paladin whining over
GoD.  Especially when the top  Pally in my guild has tanked trials herself
up thru Trial 4.  Mind you she's really well equipped and usually quite on
the ball for a pre-Elemental paladin.
