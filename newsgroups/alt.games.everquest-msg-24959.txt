It still affects the cost of buying the components needed to practice the
skill.  It will have an effect on the cost of raising your skill level, as
each thing you buy, you will pay more for.  That being said, my Shaman is
the only character that I have practiced any tradeskills with, I am more or
less at the break even point now with smithing, I have banded armor, and a
few miscellaneous items that others needed.  I picked up the skills for the
fun of doing something other than just hack and slash.  I have my smithing
at 142 I think, my baking at 140 or so.  Alchemy is maxed for my level, and
I make money selling SoW potions, although not much, my failure rate is
still fairly high.

As to losing money if you only sell to merchants, this is certainly true as
soon as Verant finds out that they made a mistake and allowed you to
actually make a profit with a tradeskill.  They correct the situation by
changing prices such that you will no longer make a profit.
