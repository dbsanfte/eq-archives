You might find this link interesting (watch, now, in the next message
I read, Taras will have already posted it)...

I picked up the R-W because I knew it was considered a "standard", if
there can be such a thing. I picked up the Thoth at the same time,
because of Crowley. 

I didn't get any others because they were all phenomenally stupid. One
of the hazards of shopping for occult material at Barnes and Noble.
They've got a good section of material for a mainstream bookstore, but
an awful lot of their Tarot selection was of the "fuzzy kittens"
variety. Ugh.

In other words, I bought the only two available at the time that
weren't patently offensive.
