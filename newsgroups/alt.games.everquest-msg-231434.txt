The religion selection as a necromancer more reflects the path you're
taught, IMO. That doesn't necessarily mean it's your true faith. To
receive formal training as a necromancer, one must at least pretend to
follow the appropriate dark god of the necromancer guild they train
under, otherwise the guild won't train them. The necromancers only
teach their ways to those that they believe to be the most dedicated
followers of their god.

Whether or not you are *REALLY* dedicated to that god is another
matter. What's important is that you were able to make the
guildmasters believe you were at least long enough to receive
training. But, as I said earlier, you will be viewed by the world in
general as a follower of a dark god simply because you practice those
magics. They know that they're only taught by devout followers of the
dark gods.
