>Lots of roumors flying around. An exploit of some kind obviously.

Since I'm bored and will be taking a nap after this, I think I'll make
some suggestions.

I have heard 3 rumors so far.

1.) Cloth Caps were selling for 50k.

Not bloody likely. If it were true they would have known the day after
the last patch. There would be many new millionaires walking around.
It is possible that Cloth Caps were selling back for more than they
cost, but again, the new volume in traffic of cloth caps would have
alerted them.

2.) No Drop exploit, where you put a No Drop item in a Non-No Drop
container then drop it on the ground.

This was a told to me to be a confirmed exploit that only worked on
FV. Supposedly it happened a while back, but was supposedly fixed. it
is possible that it has cropped up again. Why this would work on FV
and not other servers does not make sense to me. Particularly since it
would be much more advantageous on other servers with so much more No
Drop loot.

3.) Plat Dupe. Out of Sync server was allowing the banker in Rivervale
to dupe plat.

This seems the most likely. The server was out of sync last night,
buying items from the vendors took a a half second to a few seconds to
register, but the bank was as fast as ever. I've heard the plat dupe
requires you pick up all your plat then drop it in the gold spot then
immediately drop it back in the plat spot before the server catches
up. This is possible, but fixing server latency issues would seem to
be a simple issue of rebooting the server...
