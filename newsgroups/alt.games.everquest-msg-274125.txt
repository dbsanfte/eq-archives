it's actually more commonly used by women to men today as a term of
endearment "You poor big pussy cat".

Are you arguing that it wasn't used as a term of endearment and that the
term pussy for coward doesn't come from that same meaning?

no you don't get it.  This part right here has naught to do with what should
have happened it's about whether "pussy" to mean coward is sexist.

Now if you want to make claims about who gets what, why don't you look back
at the thread and you can read my take on that part, maybe then *you'll* get
it.
