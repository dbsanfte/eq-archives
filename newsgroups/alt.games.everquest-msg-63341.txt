Giving your pet a weapon no longer effects his attack speed. I still
give my pets fine steel when it drops because it's going to be
destroyed anyway, but the effect is purely cosmetic.

OTOH, whenever I get a chance, I stock up on velium weapons. Starting
at level 39 (IIRC,) your pet can be high enough in level for velium
shards to proc.
