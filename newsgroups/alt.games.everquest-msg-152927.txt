I asked a friend once what he would do if he had to switch servers with his
level 60 Cleric, and was given a choice: go naked as a level 60, or get
bumped back to level 20 but keep all his stuff, and he said he'd take level
20 with his stuff, just so he would not have to go through the hell of
getting a VP key again.  If he could have taken his VP key, he would have
went as a naked-except-for-VP-key level 60.
