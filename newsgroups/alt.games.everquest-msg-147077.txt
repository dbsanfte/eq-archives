Of course, they could have FIXED the code, like they did with enchanter
nukes (all have stuns)...used to be an enchanter couldn't spell-damage an
unstunnable critter...so they fixed it.  The nuke still goes through, but
the stun doesn't.

Would have been nice for them to fix the druid epic the same way...as two
separate components.  But still, I'm perfectly happy with it gone. :)
