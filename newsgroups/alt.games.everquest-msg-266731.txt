Trust me, adding your vote to the top poster's count isn't going to 
swing the balance. This is a bottom posting group, and its a bottom 
posting group because most of the people here prefer it.

You can either leave and find a group that top posts to top post in, or 
you can pull some humility out, realize the world doesn't revolve around 
you, and comply with the convention and preference of the great majority 
of people here, which is to bottom post; (snipping as appropriate).

Or you can get chastised about it until you either pick one of the above 
options or everybody worth talking to decides to killfile you... at 
which point you'll be welcome to top post, but there won't be much 
point, as nobody will read them.

Top posting in a bottom posting group ahd bottom posting in a top 
posting, just serves to make the threads unreadable. Even if you 
disagree with it, its counterproductive not to follow the convention of 
the group you are in.
