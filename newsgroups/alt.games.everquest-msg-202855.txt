The game has advanced to a point that it is difficult for a lower
level player to come up through the ranks anymore and be able to
survive in the same arena as the Old Whiners.

I had left the game for a couple of years. Back when I played before
the west commons and the other "NEwbie" areas were choked with players
running around. THe guy that helped me get back into the game told me
that these areas were now almost deserted because most of the players
in the game had senior characters that they played.

UO Is experiencing the same thing. The disparity between the younger
playerts and the Old Whiners. And the way these companies are handling
the situation is runining both games for everybody!
