Not a flame, I agree with you wholeheartedly. However, I think the fault 
lies NOT with VI or the GM's. The blame can be squarely placed on the 
juvenile quakeheads out there. Yes, most GM events are "canned", but 
most GM's probably now feel it's not worth the effort.

This has come up before, and I agree with some of the points and 
solutions given. I believe the GM's SHOULD banish unruly troublemakers. 
Send them to Fear or Hate for a while to cool their heels (or wait for 
the event to be over and the CR party).
