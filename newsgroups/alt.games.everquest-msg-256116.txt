  Thanks so much for all the suggestions, it looks like Grieg's End
is going to be our next field trip. I really appreciate all the
information and pointers everyone has given. Lately we've been doing
a /random 1000 and the winner gets to pick the destination for the
group/duo/trio that night, so I'm hoping my dice are kind in the
near future. Between GE and all the other places that were
suggested, we should be kept busy and interested for quite some time
=)
