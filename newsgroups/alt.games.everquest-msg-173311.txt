You're mistaken.  We didn't start this war.  We're just ending it.

Then you need glasses, and a better grasp of world events.

But let me see if I have your thesis right -- winning the
governorship of a major state and the presidency of the United
States wasn't enough to gain the elder Bush's approval?
And therefore George W. has to win a couple of wars to do so?
Do you even listen to yourself?

You might also want to try to explain why a majority of the
American public approves of war on Iraq if the UN actions don't
work, since they presumably aren't as eager or "daddy's approval"
on the matter and therefore must have some other reasons.

Someday I hope to discuss foreign affairs with adults, but
today is clearly not the day.
