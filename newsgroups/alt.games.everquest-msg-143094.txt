Sorry that my standards are a bit above yours.

I was hoping to "play the game" the way it was meant
to be played and I was hoping that out of the thousands
of EQ players, one might be able to show me a new technique
that did not involve dual-boxing/etc. but if your post
is any indication, I'm supposed to "cheat" to get this
spell...

Bummer -- so much for staying in character -- time to
create an alt just to get a spell.  Boy, that's immersive.

Mike
