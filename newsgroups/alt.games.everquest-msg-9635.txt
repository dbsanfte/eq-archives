Faction work in Mistmoore using a druid pet is about the dumbest thing
you can do.  If pathing in CB was bad, Mistmoore sucks a battleship
through a straw.

Mistmoore mobs will gank the bear pet in minutes or the bear pet will
start a massive train.  Remember aside for the entry way junk, most of
the mobs in MM will con even or deep red to the bear.  That means if
the bear attacks something, it's as if a level 20 player attacked that
same mob--the subsequent aggro range of the bear pet is SIGNIFICANTLY
larger than a level 55+ druid.

Believe me, after doing VP, I spent a lot of time in MM trying to
raise my RingOfScales faction.  It sucks and a level 20 pet is
definately not a good idea.

The only place where the bear pet is useful is in newbie dungeons like
Crushbone/Blackburrow.  Unfortunately, the pathing in those zones suck
so bad that it only works if you park the pet and pull the mobs to
you.

I found just casting healing to be much more effective in working on
faction.

In MM, just AoE he critters using Upheaval.

If I wanted faction work in Crushbone, I wouldn't be using a pet.  I
would just hit folks with minor healing or some similar useless/cheap
buff.  Or if he had a pair of ES gloves, just run around snaring
everything.
