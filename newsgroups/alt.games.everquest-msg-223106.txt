Many thanks to those that have replied - This certainly is a fascinating
class, no doubt about that. So far, I've found that I'm struggling to find
the balance of when to drain my hit points for mana, when to give my pet hit
points at the expense of my own, when to drain the mob of hit points and
give to myself! All pretty confusing after playing a Wizard. Fun though ..

Thanks again guys, I'm off to check out those links ..

Stevie.
