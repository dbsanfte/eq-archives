Belt of Growth is Hydro's common drop (named Water Elemental in Twilight
Seas) Belt of Guardianship is his rare ( 2 more AC and +3 to all instead of
+2, I think)

The Earing is off Gnurn Noeyes, a named grimling in Hollowshade Moore, he
spawns where Growlik does, in Sonic Wolf Caves, you need to help the
Grimlings take the caves to get them in. This isn't his only drop, he also
dropped some Bard drums and  nice 1hp Shaman spear 7/21 +6 wisdom. I think
the earing is his rare drop but he his farmed for it as it sells for a few
k. Warning, the Grimlings have a shit load of magic resistance, can take
forever to get snare to stick even after being tash'd.
Was trying to get one for enchanter but couldn't get him to spawn so gave up
after 5 non shows (Grimling Tribal Leader is place holder.
