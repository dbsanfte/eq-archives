Ok, I'm confused - I destinctly remember them saying that level 50
and up was going to be DB, and 45 and up are LB.  Which mobs are
48/49 and DB?

I found that patch message for someone at Graffe's the other day, and
they still don't believe in the high con bonus <shrug>

Any class that needs to go toe to toe with mobs isn't going to
solo them as fast as those who stay out of melee range.  Let's 
see you pull in an AA every 30 minutes or so like the classes
I named.

BTW - look at the SIG - I duo Tactics with my mage/BL and do
better than either of them solo, and I still don't touch the 
speed of the classe above.

Yes, I'd like a cite on that too.

Here's where it went in:
