So why do all the GOP hacks use the word "invent" if he never said that? 
  Is it because they can't understand that "took the iniative in 
creating the internet" doesn't mean invent or is it because Gore 
actually was one of the early supporters of what has come to be known by 
the term internet and should actually be applauded for his efforts? 
Just another BS non issue to keep the sheep chewing their cud while the 
puppeteers flush our future down the crapper.
