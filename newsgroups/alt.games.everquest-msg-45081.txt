That's just regular damage increase. Your lowest possible hit is still
1 point of damage. At level 51 I hit something for 39 damage with a
13/32 weapon because of the increase that everyone gets, and that also
applies to offhand weapons - it'd be kinda pointless to never hit for
more than 15 with a 7/14 offhand weapon, right?
