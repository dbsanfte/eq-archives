I live in the UK too, and I'm very interested on that story about the 
eggs... Can you produce a link? Not that I'm skeptical, it's just that 
I've so far not seen anybody carted off to jail for eating eggs the 
wrong size. Maybe I've not been paying enough attention?

At any rate, the new European constitution contains an exit clause; if a 
country does not like it, now they can leave. Perhaps you feel the UK 
should join NAFTA instead?

down the street mere days from now.
