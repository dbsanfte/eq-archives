My Eru SK sure was. I got charmed by an NPC enchanter while running 
through once with 2 other sks, and spent a full 5 minutes not in control 
of my character... and worse this is after she used me (and her 
animation pet) to waste another sk, and then charmed the last one too... 
(3 pets! damn npcs). She eventually let us go, but nuked me to death 
before i coudl zone.

Fortunately, I had managed to get out of aggro range and was able to 
pick up my corpse.

I usually went around HHK... SK, Lake Rathe, Rathe Mountains, Feerott, 
Swamp, Deserts... didn't seem in character to beg for invis, I'm 
guessing that's what you meant by the southern route?

Yup.
