PotC and PotG don't stack for sure.
mask of the unter and stalker don't either I believe

Yes theres 1 after it.  6, 18, and 24 points (i think) in general, arch, and
class skills for the 3 titles

hmm....  PoF? :)   The blue wolves in Kael would be too high for dire
charming (they are 52+)
Im sure places in Luclin hold hope for you...  scarlert desert has animals
in it and blue con stuff.  Im guessing all WW mobs are too high level

What about those dogs in Chardok

Or umm.....
