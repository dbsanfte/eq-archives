I've been back a week, had nothing of value left, so I've
just been messing around with trying out different characters.
Yesterday was trying an Iksar Shaman. Actually seems like a
fun character.

This sounds good cause I'm also on Pacific time and my playtime
can easily mirror yours. When I used to play the game I really never
did much, I think I spent too much time fishing :-) But I'd like to try
to climb up the ladder and see and do things I've never done.

I've been reading about deadly duos and a shaman / druid combo
seems to be really potent. Druid / MA is also supposed to be great
but I'm not crazy about being a MA. Any others ?

In any event I have to start a new guy so you might as well keep
your Druid if you want and I'll come to your server.

Let me know what I should play and I'll start the character
asap.

Jim
