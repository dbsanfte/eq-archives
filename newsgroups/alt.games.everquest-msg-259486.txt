Just unfortunate - you can probably take more of a bashing than him.
I try and help where I can - I do wait for the yell for help if possible,
but if it looks like they are going down and won't make it to the zone line
I will either try to heal them or hold the mob off somehow.
If the help was unwelcome, I would apologise but if you get arguments in
/tell, then it would be fair enough to ignore them ( and when they come back
train them....just joking!!!!).
