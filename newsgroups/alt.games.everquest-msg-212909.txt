 honestly I ask because I wanted to get out of EverQuest without killing
roughly 20 characters from levels 35 to 58.  I didn't come looking for
trouble but I found the same ignorant people with that smart ass attitude
that has turned me against going in EverQuest and grouping with people that
would fight over a rusty dagger.

I really don't see that my question should stir anything up but I know for
some reason most of you think selling a account is some sort of sin
punishable by death.  Grief it's just a stupid f***ing game.  I think the
ones wanting to start something are the ones yelling troll!
Try what I am, a person that doesn't post in newsgroups, a adult with a job
and a life outside EverQuest.  And I don't see anything really wrong with
selling the account other than Verant wants to make it illegal to keep me
paying a monthly charge.  I'm not a wasteful person and destroying my
characters and all their possessions seems like a waste if there's someone
out there that might enjoy it.  I could also use a few bucks to upgrade my
computer or buy some other software.  I think I'm done with games like
EverQuest.

For about a year all I really have done is walk around casting clarity II
and haste on people just to give them 30 minutes of increased game pleasure.
I charge nothing, I ask for nothing.  I'm simply burnt out paying every
month when even doing good deeds has lost my interest.  Get your head out of
EverQuest and look around the real world maybe you will understand.  Besides
since the loss of a close friend that I played with EverQuest is a painful
place at times and I need to move on with my life.

Thank You for making me so welcome in this PUBLIC newsgroup!
