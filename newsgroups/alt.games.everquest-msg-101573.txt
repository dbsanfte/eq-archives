Phil,

I know you've gotten a lot of advice on this problem, just thought I'd
chip in.

The problem with the term "lag" is that people use it (in Everquest)
to refere to two different things. To avoid confusion, I wont use it
at all.

The two things are slow frame rate and packet loss.

Slow frame rate is jerkyness in the animations you may see while
moving about. From you description, this isn't the problem your
having. A lot of the advice about re-instaling Windows, getting more
memory, upgradeing your graphics card may have an impact on this
issue.

Packet loss is characterized by that little green bar breaking up and
turning yellow or red with per centage numbers above it greater than
0%. This sounds like what you described. This is almost certainly
caused by line noise. It can be operating system related, but getting
more ram or a new graphics card won't help. The guy that posted about
getting your lines checked was right on with this. All I can add is to
have a private company test your lines if you can. The phone company
probably wont help you here. Oh, they'll send a guy out. He'll tinker
around a bit then tell you the lines are fine. A private company will
do a real job and give you real numbers for Line Loss, Line Noise and
Power Influence. You can then take these numbers to the phone company
and they can fix it. The suggestion about trying a different phone
jack is a good one. Another easy thing to try is if you have several
phones in your house, unplug them. A defective phone, or a bad jack
with a phone plugged in can cause this.

HTH,

Brian
