I've yet to find a key vendor. I DO know that the key all Paineel newbies
get is the WRONG key. :(  I'd love to find out who the right vendor is.  A
hundred plat isn't that much money to anyone high enough to go to The Hole.

The entrance area is a good place to go with a small group.  You can get
back to the zone line as long as you make NO jumps, even fairly small ones.
There's around 10 critters with fast respawn times to keep you busy so you
have nothing to worry about there.

NEVER jump into the big hole unless you don't mind losing your corpse or
spending money and time finding a necro willing to summon it.

A level 1 Halfling rogue with Brell Serillis as god can move throughout the
vast majority of the zone without being harmed.  Everything will CON Ready
To Attack (even if you sit down in front of them), but only ratmen and
undead will actually kill you.  Halfling rogues get sneak/hide at level 1
and nothing in The Hole can see past "Rogue Invisibility."  I worked my
rogue up to level 6 & got him a lock pick and he now handles the door for
those who are too fat to fit through easily.  MAKE SURE THE ROGUE IS BOUND
RIGHT THERE OUTSIDE THE HOLE.  He's going to die a LOT...might as well keep
him convenient. :)  He makes a great corpse recoverer, too.
