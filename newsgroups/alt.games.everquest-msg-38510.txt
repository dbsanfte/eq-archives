I've been there!  There was one other PC in there, he warned me about the
high aggro range.  I said, "no problem, I'm apprehensive to them and wasn't
going to attack anything."  Then I ran into the Wild Tiger on the little
training Island...  Suffice it to say, I managed to train most of the zone
to the zone line, oops.  Made it with 31 HPs, the other guy was fine, man, I
was running, swimming, jumping for my life  :P
