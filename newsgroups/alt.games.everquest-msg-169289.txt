So I'm reading this and I get to the cleric committing suicide and think "No,
not Cheal, SE, DvA, anything but CHeal!"

Then I notice the cleric is 54.  My solutions all required level 62... although
CE at 59 would have worked too.  Its only been a couple weeks now that I've had
SE, amusing that its hard for me to remember Not having it for situations like
this!
