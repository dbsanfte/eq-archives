I think it'd be better (less unbalancing, but still useful, at any
rate) if we were allowed to set up different banks, and you could
select one to memorize the set from inside your spellbook. It would
also be less work when you died.

Example:

Bank 1:
Shock of Ice,
Flame of Fire,
Root,
Snare,
Evac,
Steelskin,
Gate

Bank 2:
WC Port
NRo port
CS port
EK port
Gate
Bind
Invis
TL Bind

This is obviously a wizard's...the first would be the normal group
setup, the second a set of spells that the wizard would use while not
grouped.

What do you think?
