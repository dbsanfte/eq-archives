Newshound and I agree finally, you are definitely misguided in your
enthusiasm.

Natural resources (as already stated), a slave labor workforce, and
the Atlantic Ocean made the US the powerhouse that it is.  Granted,
many intelligent, resourceful, ethical, and wonderful people were
involved in making this country what it is, but don't think for a
second that if we were attached to europe we would be speaking
anything other then German.

The fact that we came out economically unscathed from both world wars
is the largest reason for our position today.  And that was due solely
to our natural border protection.

Capitalism is wonderful and arguably the best market theory in the
world, but it really had very little to do with our current world
leadership position.
