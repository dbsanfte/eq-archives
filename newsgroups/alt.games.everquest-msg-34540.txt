> Not true, the PH will despawn if not killed.

It didnt always despawn when I did the quest . That was a long time ago when
mitty still had the gold ring but still :) You had to go downstairs and kill
basically the whole third floor to be assured of spawn starting . It was
fairly easy to tell if spawn was started , just watch and see if mob at
entrance spawns every 20 mins or so. If ph always despawns now then that is
a new thing to make it easier . Oh and a general /rude to bizbee.
