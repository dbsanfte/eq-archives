For the effort required to obtain a warrior epic, you CAN gain better
though.
DN as you mentioned (willsapper) is a mighty fine choice, although he
doesn't really live very long.

CT also has some very high quality weapons (tradable too) - these are 1group
things that offer weapons on a par with a Statue of Rallos Zek weapon.
Swiftblades are all sold in my guild now when we get them (and all the
guilds above us) so if you can raise the funds, you can get a weapon from a
"high end" mob

Totally given up on your warrior now, for the wizard?
