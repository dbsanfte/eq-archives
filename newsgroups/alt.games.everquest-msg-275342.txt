For me, that should be marked as solo as you could (in theory)
just run to the top with a huge train not having to kill any
group mobs.  I have seen some people do this before now.

I'm not looking for a definate statement that I can do a
particular quest.  I'm looking for a hint to help me choose
which of my (up to) 50 quests in my book to try and clear out
if I have some time when I need to be soloing (due to lack of
time to look for a group or just that I cannot get a group).
I'd be getting nothing for free.

I'm not saying that my path to glory is obstructed and I'm
not complaining either.  I'm just saying that my enjoyment
of the game could be increased if I could get a better clue
as to which quests I could be working to complete whilst I
was soloing.

And that's exactly why I would like this information.  I get
no sense of achievement if I am working on a quest and I hit
a wall that I cannot pass without a group or a raid.  If I
could have spent that time on a quest that I have a chance of
completing I would have been much more happy.  Even if I couldn't
complete it because I got stuck due to my lack of ability
to solve a problem.

Also, I haven't mentioned anything about quest rewards so
I'm not sure why you brought that into the discussion.
I'm generally happy with having completed the quest, even
if I get 37cp as the reward, as long as the quest was
challenging.
