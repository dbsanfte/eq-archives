Got a guild cleric his sprinkler only last week, general conclusion was
that ragefire sucked, but chardok was a blast.

Chardok royals are a pretty good example, they are on a 4 hour spawn
cycle, with no placeholder, so they are just about always up by the time
you get down to their room.

Ragefire sucked because it was on a long spawn timer, and was
ridiculously easy for the quality of the reward (i.e. the best item in
the game, bar none). So you can't just wander in and kill it, you have
to sit there staring at a wall, and hope someone else doesn't come in
with more force faster or more ruthless than you and kill it anyway. 

You could fix the ragefire camp by putting in a version of the TCC code,
so that you couldn't help kill it if it was not _red_ to you. You would
have to add some alternative way for a higher level cleric to get a
sprinkler though.

This is true for _soloable_ mobs. It is _not_ true for group or raid-
only mobs - Verant can do math as well as anyone, they know that not
every potential drop can be killed simultaneously, given the number of
people on the servers.

They might well make it 4 hours, like Vindicator and Chardok and many
others, to discourage people sitting in the room doing nothing between
repops.

In any case, it doesn't really matter if the spawn time is 4 hours, 8
hours, or once a week. Noone sits there camping Vox, they wait until she
pops and then gather forces and go kill her. If you made that guy that
drops the black stone the same, then the game would be much better for
it.
