The Gateway system has an AGP slot.  The Voodoo2 card is in this slot.  It
is a level 1.0 AGP.  Here in is the problem of changing the video card.  I
have not been able to determine which of the cards on the magical list will
work with my Gateway GP6-400 system.  If anyone can tell me which card to
change to, then I maybe back in the game soon.
