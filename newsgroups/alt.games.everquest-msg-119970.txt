Are you fucking shitting me? You can cast it on people you're not
grouped with? Does the recipient at *least* get a message? Friend of
mine was just this morning telling me how cool that spell is, as he is a
Warlord and MA's a lot on raids. They were up in PoA for about three
days and one of his Chanters had just gotten it recently, and it really
improved his taunt and aggro holding ability.

But I never would have DREAMED this could be cast on a non group member
without a confirmation box. Look for this to be changed in an emergency
patch coming your way soon.

I can just see it now. Wizard fighting in a giant group, sitting there
medding and watching the giant's health bar drop to 75%... waiting for
it to get to half. So far, all he's done is click stick it once for a
small debuff and range check... chanter walks by and suddenly ... WHAM.
