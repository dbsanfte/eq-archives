And here you're hitting on one of my favorite pet peeves in the game.
And I really think it comes down to a fundamental difference in mindset
between regular "sellers" and random "buyers" and gets screwed up by a
few assholes on both sides.

Granted, there may be some item that I've determined ahead of time that
I very much want, will not be able/willing to camp for, and I'll
reasearch it. I'll know what the average price range is, and providing I
have the plat, I'll know how much I'm willing to pay. At one point I was
going to buy a Lammy, and I determined I'd buy one if I found it for 7.5
K or less. However, this is rarely the case. I've *heard* of lot's of
nice items that I'd consider picking up for my main or one of my alts.
But I dont' have a price list on hand at all times, nor do I have a
photographic memory.

So maybe I'm just cruising through EC on my way to the bank in FP to
unload, and suddenly I see,
"Bobkat auctions WTS Robe of Godlike Verantsmashing. Send tells"

Well, maybe I'd like to pick up the RGV for my necro, eh? But I've no
clue what it goes for. I'd rather Bobkat put an asking price, even if it
includes "or best offer" in his /auction, but hey, I'll send him a tell.
If he quotes me a price, I'll go ask my guild and /friends list if it's
a reasonable deal, a rip-off, or a steal. But when Bobkat comes back
with, "*shug*, what's it worth to you?" then I just blow him off. The
best I'll do, at that point, is offer him about fifty plat if I'm pretty
sure it's worth at least a thousand. That *might* jar him into coming up
with an asking price. But generally I just move on and don't answer him.
That's just too fucking annoying for words, and no way to do business.
If you want to set up shop and sell shit all day long, know what the
items go for, get the best price you can, and be prepared to quote one.
