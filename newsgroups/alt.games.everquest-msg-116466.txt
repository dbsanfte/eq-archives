|    Says who?

	Various NPCs refer to "settlements" in the Commonlands, Plains of Karana,
etc.  It doesn't make sense in any case for the "official" cities to be the
only urbanized areas in the world.

|    Notwen, what is the lore behind the General in Kith? AFAIK he sure ain't
|in exile.

	AFAIK, he is on the outs for blowing the assassination of the High Elf
ambassador to the Bayle court.  It was his project, that's why he's so
interested in getting that box back.

|    So WHAT direction is Faydwer from Antonica via Freeport, then?

	East, of course; the ship runs backwards.  (Why they don't just reverse
the direction of the ships, I'll never know.)

	The *game* can't be wrong.  The game is reality (a virtual one, but that's
all we've got in this case.)  If someone showed you a map that showed your
property as being adjacent to a property you knew it wasn't adjacent to, which
would be wrong?

|    High Elves claim they do, because they have the highest starting WIS. I
|claim dwarves do, because I'm a HP cleric and dwarves get the highest
|starting STA.

	Then at least it's an issue.

|Curious - do humans or wood elves get the highest STA when
|making rangers?

	Humans -- but WE's get points in harder-to-raise areas, and more stat
points total.  You would have been hard-pressed to find someone who rates
Humans even as well as Wood Elves as a Ranger choice even before the recent
favoritism; Mr. Hance is the only person I've ever seen even try to make the
argument.

|    Chuckle. Name another cleric bracer with more MANA on it.

	Something Clerics of that level have more than enough of.

|it makes it inferior to other items that have HPs, but every high elf that
|has quested one is still wearing it.

	The HE Clerics in my guild are not going out of their way to get this
trinket.

|    White Dragonscale Helm. Dread Coronet. Crown of Narandi. Crown of the
|Kromzek Kings. All have higher AC, better HPs, and usually the same or
|better total resists than the Helm of the Tracker.

	And not one of which is a Ranger item -- all but the Crown of Narandi are
all/all, meaning there's not much chance of a Ranger getting them.  (Narandi
was a stealth upgrade -- that item was PAL/SK only when released, I hadn't
heard they added RNG.)

|    Which of those two would YOU wear, given the choice? Looks like you need
|to kill Tormax more. ;-)

	While we could probably make a credible effort at Tormax (with the help of
people I'd rather not have the help of), we could not possibly kill him enough
times that the Rangers would start getting considered for the crown.

|    You forgot to look at the pottery stuff. The original idols were trash,
|but the new set of idols includes this:
|
|Golden Idol of Karana: AC 4 STA 4 WIS 5 MANA 40, PRI SEC RANGE, recommended
|level of 20.
|
|    That isn't so shabby for mid-levels compared to the stats on bows.
|Hardly end-game material, but only the most recent Tunare fletching stuff is
|really end-game material.

	Tunare gets a similar item, so that's a wash.  More to the point, no one
is going to use either; Goranga Idols are free with two box tops these days.
(And nothing goes in my range slot that doesn't shoot arrows.)

	You're comparing a mid-level item that is eclipsed by many drops, most of
them cheap and readily available, to a bow that is literally the best one you
can get without a major raid.

|    Because it apparently was balanced enough that you didn't whine before
|the Tunare fletching was introduced. If a change could alter the balance
|negatively today, a change could set it right in the future.

	The Karana contingent has not been happy over the Helm of the Tracker
since its discovery.  Rangers in general made a major issue out of cultural
fletching when the idea was first proposed well over a year ago -- in fact, we
were told at the time that advanced fletching would either be Ranger only or
available to both WE's and Rangers.  Then it fell off the radar (the official
story varied between Yak deciding that Fletching wasn't in need of
improvements and some higher-echelon decision that better bows wouldn't be
balanced).  Most of us thought it was a dead issue, and we were all blindsided
by the May 8th stuff.

	If after all the feedback, all the petitions, all the discussion on the
company and fan web sites, all the discussions at the conventions, they went
ahead and screwed us AGAIN, then why should I believe they're going to
suddenly get a clue in PoP?  Hell, the PoP material says Karana's not even in
control of his own plane!

|    Fixed how, so your race/religion choice is exactly as powerful as
|another, the RP aspects of it be damned?

	What RP aspects?  There are no RP issues here.  The link between Rangers
and archery comes through Robin Hood, not Tolkein.  A Wood Elf in EQ is no
better an archer than a member of any other race of equal class and level.
Archery in EQ is linked to Rangers, not elves.  Prior to the 7th shawl
abomination, you would have had to search long and hard to find a high-skill
fletcher who wasn't also a Ranger.  They took something that used to belong to
all Rangers, and gave it to a subsection of the class.  (And to outsiders -- a
WE Druid can make better bows than me, even though he can't USE them at all.
What kind of sense does that make?)


|so I can feel good about my choice!" That's about all it is - you didn't
|know how good the Tunare bracer was until a cleric like me told you,

	Of course I knew "how good" it was.  I knew what the stats were like.  I
also knew that no one I know was going ga-ga over it.

|    Blackburrow and Crushbone are about equal when it comes to quality of
|newbie dungeons.

	Disagree strongly.  Blackburrow is a twisty maze of passages, all alike,
where nothing of interest drops.  Crushbone is a nice wide-open layout with
loot that (in its day) was desired enough to KS over.

|GFay has almost no landmarks, so finding something to kill
|is miserable.

	That's what your /loc key is for.  (Rangers, the people we're talking
about, will push the one marked TRACK though.)

|The bank and shops you speak of are in a treehouse city that
|has to be the hardest place in game to find something in - even the maps
|with the game mapped it wrong.

	It won't take nearly as long to learn your way around as the time you'd
waste running through extra zones to bank.

|I'd mention the wood elf newbie corpses
|littering the ground beneath Kelethin, but with the new below level 10 rules
|that isn't so much of a problem.

	They haven't been common for a long time.

|If I were a brand-new Karana ranger, I'd
|take a trivial run to Qeynos and level up in the newbie yard (hopefully
|Fippy wouldn't jump me on the way).

	Or Tomax, or Varsoon, or Pyzjyn....  GFay has no mobs of this nature, of
course.  (Non-Rangers in the QHills area also get to deal with Holly
Windstalker.  Rangers won't have a problem with her if they RP.)

	On Legends, the first thing I did with my Ranger was run him to GFay via
the Nexus.  Couldn't get out of Qeynos fast enough.  At level 10 I went back
just to see if maybe Blackburrow or Everfrost would be better hunting grounds,
and frankly, they're not.
