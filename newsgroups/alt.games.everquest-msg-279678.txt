Thanks for the replies, I appreciate it.  Yes, human paladin out of
Qeynos.  At least I know that there's hope of finding one of the things
and I'll keep trying.  I was beginning to think the things didn't exist
in the game anymore.  I don't really even much need the piece of armor
at this point.  It's just the principle of the thing.   Shame about
getting eaten by the trolls, lol, I'll probably try anyway though...

Thanks
