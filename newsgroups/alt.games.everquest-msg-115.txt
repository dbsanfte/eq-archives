Why not create an enchanter in Felwithe, get your friend to PL you to 4th (or
just play to 4th in an afternoon), buy "gate" and take the boat to FV ?

A 16th enchanter can bodyguard a 4th enchanter from Felwithe to BB docks pretty
easily. Mez and memblur work wonders, no combat necessary.

Take the boat to FV, buy the spell, gate home, done.
