The question is would you have seen the same performance improvement if you
had reformatted and then reinstalled me?  By reformatting and installing
windows, you are removing a lot of crap that tends to accumulate over time
on a system, and you are doing a fair job of defragmenting the drive as
well.  It is possible that this had more to do with the performance
improvement than the changing of the OS.  I don't know if that is the case,
just thought I'd point out that it is a possible explanation as well.
