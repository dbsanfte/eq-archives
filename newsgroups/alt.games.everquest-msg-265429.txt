I figure it because that's what it says.  The First Amendment reads,
in toto:

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

That's the whole thing, start to finish.

It prohibits Congress from establishing a religion, and it prohibits
Congress from stopping people from exercising their religion.

It does not stop Congress from paying a religion to perform a service,
it doesn't stop a religion from offering.  It doesn't stop Congress
from bitching about a religion, and it doesn't stop a religion from
bitching about Congress.

It prevents the creation of LAWS which provide advantages (or
disadvantages) to any religion.

As long as they're not passing laws, it's entirely up to them.

Then let 'em bitch.  It's an American right (freedom of speech, same
amendment) for people (and that *includes* church people) to bitch
about the government.

If you don't know why, then you really need to do a bit of reading in
regards to what is and isn't a religion.

The only people I can think of who *would* be influenced by that
shouldn't be let out on the streets without a keeper.  And a leash.

And when they start trying to change the laws, THEN they're in
conflict with the First Amendment.

I have no idea what these are.

This is iffier.  Personally, I don't think the words should be there.
However, they also aren't particularly objectionable, either.  After
all, do they mean YHWH, Jesus, Allah, or who?  Probably Jesus' father,
of course.

And face it, the Excited States *were* created "under God".  If you
don't like it, fine, but you can't say it isn't true.  The Founding
Fathers were all Christian, to the best of my recollection.

If you're an immigrated hardcore Jew from Israel who doesn't know what
you're immigrating into, then you're an idiot.  I never have sympathy
for people who have all the information available, go do the thing,
then say "but I don't like it this way".

Incorrect on both counts.  The Constitution doesn't say any such
thing, and yes, there is room for interpretation.  If there weren't,
we wouldn't be having this discussion.

By the way, it doesn't bother me, and I'm 2nd RCoS.  Why does it
bother you, a self-described atheist, so much?

So?  See above.  It is not the government creating laws.  That's
what's prohibited, and by an amazing coincidence, that's exactly what
they're *not* doing.  They are not creating laws; they're renting a
hall that's not being used on that day, at that time.

Also, if the citizens of the US are simple-minded enough to change
religions based on seeing things as they walk past them, then you've
got *much* bigger problems than whether to vote for the fool or the
liar.

The result of a bet between two authors should not, in my opinion, be
a tax-exempt group.

Umm, actually it's one of the founding principles of *your* nation.
And as demonstrated above, you really need to reread what it says.
