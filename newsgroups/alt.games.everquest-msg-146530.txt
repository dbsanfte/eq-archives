At low level, that isn't going to make a big difference.  (All numbers in
what follows assume that the recent XP changes are for 50+ only, rather than
across the board).

Consider a level 5, killing a level monster.  Suppose that gives 25 units of
XP, which all goes to the one person.  With three people, they would need to
kill something that gives ~75 units of XP (it's approximate because of the
grouping bonus).  They would need to kill a level 9 monster for that
(actually, something between 8 and 9, but I'll round up).  Level 9 is going
to be tough for 3 level 5 characters.

In general, to get the same XP as soloing a mob of level N, a group of three
needs to kill a mob of level ~1.7N.

What makes groups come out ahead is not killing tougher things (if by
tougher, you mean higher level), but rather killing *more* things.

Consider a group of three warriors, for example, identical level.  Suppose a
solo warrior can fight a given monster, and it takes time T for the fight,
with the warrior taking D damage.  Suppose the warrior heals at a rate h, so
it takes D/h time to heal back that damage after the fight.  That means
that, starting from full health, fighting the monster, and healing back to
full, takes T+D/h.  Suppose the XP from the mob is X.  The warrior earned XP
at this rate: X / (T+D/h).  That's his maximum rate, which is hit if he can
find a steady supply of mobs, so he doesn't lose time between fights
searching.

Now do that same fight with three identical warriors.  Let's consider first
where the mob does all its damage to one of the warriors.  The other two
take no damage.  Since three warriors are beating on the mob, the fight only
lasts 1/3 as long.  That also means that the warrior taking the damage only
takes 1/3 as much as he would have solo.  So, time is not T/3 + (D/3)/h.
Each warrior only gets X/3 XP, however, so the rate they can get XP is now
(X/3) / (T/3 + (D/3)/h)....which is exactly the same as before.  So, a group
of three fighting this way was neither better nor worse than the solo
warrior.  However, if there is not a steady supply of monsters, this group,
fighting this way, will do better, because why the one who took damage is
sitting down healing, the others can be out finding the next monster.

Now, finally, let's consider what happens if the warriors get the monster to
spread its damage among all three of them, by taking turns taunting it, for
instance.  Fight time is still T/3.  However, instead of one warrior taking
D/3 damage and the others taking none, all three take D/9 damage.  Now, the
potential XP rate is (X/3) / (T/3 + (D/9)/h), or X / (T + D/(3h)).  Compare
this to the solo warrior: it is basically just like a solo warrior who heals
3 times as fast!

It is this kind of thing that the recent high level XP changes are partly
trying to address, making it so there is an XP reason to fight harder
things.  This is also the reason that low greens don't give XP.  IF they
did give XP, on the normal XP curve, the most efficient way to play would be
to kill trivial monsters.  For example, when my Wizard was around level 51,
he was killing mobs that were about level 40, which gave 120000 XP.  He
could kill one, med up to get back the mana, and go kill another, about
every 5 minutes, so he was earning XP at 24000/minute.

If greens gave normal XP, another way to earn 24000/minute would be to kill
one level 18 mob/minute.  Could he do that?  In one minute, he medded up about
240 mana at that level.  That's enough to cast a Draught of Fire, which did
about 650 damage.  That would be enough to kill a typical level 18 mob in
one shot.
