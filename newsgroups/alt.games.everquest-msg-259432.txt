Good explanation, Lance. I've several times had to educate loot-happy 
people in various groups I've been in on this very subject. Often, people 
just assume that everyone else is getting a fair share when they loot and 
honestly don't know, but I guaran-damn-tee that just as often the 
offenders who say, "Huh, I never knew that," are just full of crap.

It really sucks when people actually have to be told to share and be 
considerate of everyone else. :/
