   Ok..great if you happen to be a dwarf.  But what about warriors
that don't start with great stats?  Like, say, a gnome.  Good dex
and agility (and intelligence, not that _that_ really matters except
for skill increases), but lousy strength.  Even after throwing all
starting points into it, the starting strength is only 95.  
   I keep an eye out for str gear I can afford (somewhat twinked, but
none of my characters are exactly rich).  I think I got up to 108 now.
Still not what I would call impressive.  So for me....str or ac?
