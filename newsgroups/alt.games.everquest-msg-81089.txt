OK, I guess I can see this, but how much mana does that take for an 
enchanter?  Seriously.  It takes 0 mana for a bard to mez an add, though 
we don't have mem-blur, but I can't remember the last time we had an add 
on a CR that was mezzable.  (Hoshkar wandering in on a recovery was rather 
a suprise, then he did it two more times because we were sure he didn't 
wander that far.)
I guess if you're recovering in a exp-grind zone, it may be useful 1 time 
out of 100, but a newly rezzed chanter can cast NOTHING.  A newly rezzed 
bard can sing all but 2 songs.
