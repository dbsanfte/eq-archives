Oh, do pay attention, fellows.  This is someone who doesn't like EQ, (the 
poster EQ, not the game we all love), and has threatened to expose his 
heinousness for all those who may have been influenced by his posting in 
the Isreal vs. Palestine thread that would not die.  So naturally, he 
wants everyone related to that thread (ie, the usual 6-7 newsgroups) to 
see his witty defamation of EQ's character.

I'm trying to figue out why I consider that substantially more retarded 
than my defamation of EQ's grammar, other than that he felt he had to 
start a whole new thread.  And that at least his grammar, as it stood, had 
some vague sense of bearing on what was being discussed in the original 
thread.  Ok, I'm stretching.

I suppose it's all fine (in my book) to bash someone in a newsgroup, but 
how about bashing them for what they're actually talking about...
