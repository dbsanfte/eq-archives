Toilers in ME perhaps. They are all blue at 60, but you may want something a
little more challenging. (UP perhaps at ZL?)
On the positive side, pulling is real easy and fast, and they realy suck for
magic resistance.
Theres a no-path area just south-se of the lake. A little cramped but its
the best spot there I can find so far.
