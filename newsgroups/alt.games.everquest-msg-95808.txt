I've fought there for the last three days, and I agree with what
others are saying about taunt.   The only way I could explain how agro
was acting was that taunt simply did not affect the mobs.

In courtyard and tae/tower, I was just using root repeatedly to try to
keep the mobs hitting the tank.  When we moved into the maze, MR
seemed to go up a bit and I dusted off the level 16 mem blur for the
first time in ages.  

We had an epic warrior, a primal monk, and a ranger with a staff from
Tunare that proc's SNARE!  That staff is Tunare's revenge on her
rangers who turn against her, I tell ya.  Most of the night either I
(enchanter) or the ranger was tanking.  

Lizards have high FR, and the warrior epic taunt proc is fire based,
so no joy there.

If the changes on test server regarding mem blur go live, should make
the zone more manageble.
