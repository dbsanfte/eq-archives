Coming to a standstill isn't enough, even if you wait a bit.  Due
to arcane online game "thingies" (that someone could explain
and it would go right over my head) the game is very very
bad at knowing when you have stopped running.

So you need to tell it.

Sitting and standing back up will do this, as you've noticed.
This is because standing can only be accomplished while
stationary.  Problem here is that sit/stand takes a bit of
time, and sit increases your aggro (at least temporarily,
effect is gone when you stand) as you look like an easy
target... mobs treat you as if you were level one when you
are sitting.

Fortunately, there is a much better way to explain things
to the server.  Its the caster twist.  Stop forward movement,
spin to your left, hold your knees in tight, and then cast.
Ok, I threw in "the knees in tight part".  Stop, spin in place,
cast.  Works because spinning without moving forward
is different from turning while moving, so you are sending
a command which can only be implemented when you
are NOT moving forward.

I like to spin all the way around while I cast, gives me a
peek at whats going on around me and how close the
thing chasing me is getting.  This is largely a style question,
though.  Works just as well to turn a quarter turn left,
cast, run, turn a quarter right, cast, run... whatever you
want to do.  Whats important is that you do this, as my
Karate instructors say, "cleanly".  Full stop.  Spin.  Cast.
Not "stopping while spinning, casting, coming to full stop
after spell cast has begun...."  Start out with little pauses
between the steps.  As you gain skill at doing this, you'll
get smoother and spend less time on it.  Just try not to
let it get sloppy or you'll start interrupting yourself again.

PS advanced class: start casting, mob punches you and
knocks you back, move forward to same exact spot,
spin, no interrupt.  Good trick if you can manage it.
