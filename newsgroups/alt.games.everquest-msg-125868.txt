The only problem I have with your logic is "bad thing" = offensive.
I think just because something offends (some) people does not
necessarily make it a bad thing (tm).
Take art for example. (any art). 
It offends some people, but is not a bad thing (imho).

I agree that in an open forum like this foul language is out of place,
however it also must be expected.

I think most people should try to curb their mouths some what and
realise that you can get a point accross with out threatening to ram
objects into unlikely places.

I also think that you should give your horse a rest. It must be a long
way up, up there, perhaps the air is kinda thin.
