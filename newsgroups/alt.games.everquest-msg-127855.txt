It's nothing different than what pilots do under VFR.  Or, if you want a
more "in character" example, a boat captain in a harbor.  Grab a cloth map,
use landmarks, stick pins in the map.  If a character can always know their
/loc, then I'm going to assume that they start out with a skill of 255 in
Dead Reckoning.  This is nothing navigators haven't been doing since the
beginning of time.
