Conversely, I was in the hole the other day, spent 3 hours fighting
down, got to the ruined city parts, a *single* group of mid 50's
having a real ball, one of those groups that just "gels" cohesively
and works perfectly, pickup druid and shaman, friendly guild enchanter
and cleric, me and another guildy monk, we're moving like lightning,
nothing can stop us, nothing, nothing!

Another golem, ratman add, its all good, we're doing ok, clerics
going LoM, ok ok we're fine, damn there goes thorns "Hey, DS Please"
fight fight chop chop we're going to win AGAIN so easily haha this
is an excelle LOADING.... PLEASE WAIT

"WTF?"

"Uh..."

"WTF?! WHERE ARE WE?"

"WTF hap[pened?"

The poor druids face when she realised she'd hit evac instead of thorns ;) ;) ;)
