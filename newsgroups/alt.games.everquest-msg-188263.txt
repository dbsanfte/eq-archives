  Yay!  This could be fun... are there any adult orientated
MMORPGs out there?  We might be breaking into virgin territory,
so to speak.  I bet you and I could come up with something that
might be entertaining to a largish segment of the population. 
The same segment, I'm guessing, that also support those 1-900
numbers.   Heck, we could even produce commercials with Bimbettes
telling how they are the flesh behind the avatar...

Ryou, let's do lunch.
