The difference for me is when you get a character rather high (say 35+) and
want to try a new one.  At that point, rats and bats were SO long ago, and
you want to get to where you were.  For example, played a monk to 32.  At
that point, my guild needed a cleric, so I sold ALL his gear and had a level
6 cleric with 200 wis and tons of hp. (don't twink below 6 b/c of the fast
corpse decay).  I wanted to get back quickly to the 30's to continue in the
monks footprints.  The cleric is now 47, and I'm thinking of trying mage.
So, I've put together a grocery list for my cleric to camp/buy and when I'm
ready i'll get my mage up.

It depends on what part of the game you enjoy the most.  If you like being
able to solo and hold your own against something your level, then don't
twink and enjoy those first 10 levels.  If you perfer the thrill of the
stronger encounters with the real special loot, then twink to get the new
guy up to the "fun" part.
