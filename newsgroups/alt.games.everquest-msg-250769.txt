There were steamfont gnome guards and butcherblock dwarves. Also
Cyrlindreela or whatever the fuck her name was. Lots of Freeport
guards. Highkeep bards/nobles. Ogre guards. Spectres. And more.

There were lots of kiting places in old world. However there were even
more druids (and necros) than there were spots.

As for fun, maybe by today's standards you can say "I wouldn't do it,
50 isn't worth it", but for many of us who played back then, it was.

I recall them not caring and going out and getting exp three times
faster than the group that spurned them.

Fuck. I was the one not caring and doing it.
