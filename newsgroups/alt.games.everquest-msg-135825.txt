Looks like my ISP news server screwed up again and didn't post. Or maybe it
did and this post will show up twice. I apologize if that is the case.

Original message:

    I am wondering if anyone else is having this problem or if it's just me.
I have now been killed twice from this bug. After I first login to EQ and
select my character and it loads the zone, whenever I first get within range
of a fight (where you start to see the dmg msgs, spells or melee), EQ locks
up for 45-60 seconds. This got my enchanter killed in Trak when a druid I
was with pulled one of those named nasties and EQ locked up for me, next
thing I know I'm dead. The other time was with my necro after I pulled one
of those bloodtribe guys in Scarlet desert. I normally solo those things
with no problem but when the mobs get a free 60 second head start while you
sit in lala land you don't usually survive. This lockup occurs with and
without the other spells and other hits turned on/off. Does anyone else have
this problem? It's been going on for about the last 2 months. This is an
extremely frustrating problem. I would appreciate any insight as to why it
may be happening. Thanks

Bill
