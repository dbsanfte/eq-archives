It seems contradictory, but it isn't: the first one is a
statement about not playing games hoping to get away with doing
less than requested, the second is about the way the interface
works.

If he asks for four rat whiskers, you have several options:

A) Hand in a single stack of rat whiskers with the number 4 in
the corner.  This is four whiskers, and it MIGHT work, some NPCs
will accept stuff in a stack and count how many are in there. 
Most will NOT, though.

B) Hand in four individual rat whiskers, one in each of the four
slots he has for items.  This will ALWAYS work, every time, never
fails.

C) Hand in just One item and then hit give.  Repeat, repeat,
repeat.  IF nobody else is around this will always work as well,
and sometimes it will work after just one, sometimes after just
two, sometimes after just three, sometimes after all four.  If it
works before the fourth item, its because someone else handed in
three, two, or one of the item earlier... or perhaps handed in
one or two or three stacks of four assuming the NPC is typical
and doesn't count whats in a stack as more than one item.

C1) Hand in one item, and if that doesn't work, run off to get
another and repeat... not all together.  Oddly, I can think of at
least one case where this is required if you are solo, because
the item requested is Lore (you can't carry more than one) but
two are needed.

The reason C works is the reason C1 is a bad idea if you can
avoid it; you hand in three items, someone else comes along and
hands in one and gets the reward.  You come back with what you
think is the fourth item, no joy, go away, someone else comes
along and hands in three more and gets rewarded again, having now
gotten twice the reward for the same effort as you, who got no
reward at all.

If someone hands in one item, then you hand in four as in B),
then you get the success message and the reward.  Then if they
come along and hand in three more, they get success and reward. 
Because while you think you handed in four, you really handed in
three, got reward, and handed in one more!

I can't think of any circumstance, though, in which you can hand
in exactly whats been requested, one in each slot, and still not
get the reward.  

Hmm, no, here's one; sometimes the NPC gives you a container you
are supposed to fill up, then hit a combine button which makes a
different item, and then hand that it.  If you hand him an
uncombined container full of items you lose the items, if you
hand him the items without the container you still probably lose
them (but maybe not, thats been sort of fixed).  Again, you have
to do just what you are supposed to... and knowing what to do is
half the trick.
