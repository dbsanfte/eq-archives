I'm not sure about other servers, but on Bristlebain, GM events are usually
unannounced, and work something like this:

GM decides to run an event, or Verant has one schedualed.  
GM checks all the zones designed for characters of less than level 15, and
chooses the one with the most people.
GM shows up and turns into a level 60 invincible mob with Death Touch.
GM shouts something "appropriate" to the zone, and proceeds to butcher
everything that moves.
GM continues to do this until they get bored.  By then, all the newbies
have either been killed and removed from the zone or have disconnected
their modems because the GM was sitting on their bind point.
GM turns off Invincible flag, so that they can now have a "fair fight" with
what usually amounts to the entire population of high-level players at that
time of day.
GM still kills half of them before finally allowing themself to die.
High level players who survived are "rewareded" with some awesome items. 
Everyone else gets zero.

In my opinion, GM events are an exuse to twink the Uberguilds.  They are
almost never role-playing oriented, and it's almost impossible to get
anything unless you have more firepower than the GM.  In the few cases
where it *is* RP oriented, everyone tries to gank the GM anyway since
that's how they got the "phat lewt" every other time, and the event turns
into a disaster.  The GM either gets fed up and kills all the
troublemakers, or gets fed up and aborts the event.  Either way, everyone
involved is left with the idea that RP GM events suck, and wishes the GM
had just gone ahead and shown up as Nagafen and started killing people.
