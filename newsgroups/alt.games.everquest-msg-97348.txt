Couple of questions for you experienced 'questers.

I've put in my 20 training points into Tailoring, and while I have a spiffy 
set of patchwork to show for it, I'm not quite sure what to do next.  I 
mean, yeah, sure, I'm making bandages like a champ and climbing the ladder, 
but I seem to recall someone mentioning that you could make yourself 
somewhat useful by making patchwork to sell cheap to fellow and future 
newbies.  What's the usual process for this...do I need to go hunt down my 
own wolves (I'm in Kelethin) and keep a stock of skins and buy patterns to 
order, or do I advertise on a "bring me a skin and a pattern" basis?  
What's the usual way of these things?

Also, regarding auctions, how the heck do you keep track of all the prices?  
I realize there are the various pricing sites, but there are just -so- many 
different kinds of items shooting by as WTS, with no pricing attached.  Do 
you really get familiar enough after awhile that "Scaled Kunark Foozle 
Armor" triggers a thought of "oh, yes, that's 400pp, so I'll offer 350pp" 
automatically?  Right now, I'm struggling to remember what I should be 
selling bone chips, bat wings, and crushbone belts for, much less all this 
fancy stuff.
