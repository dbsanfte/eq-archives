(not looked at your magelo profile yet)

Tserinnas robe from the 7th floor Tower of Frozen Shadow is extremely
pretty and quite nice ;) it has 50 mana which is bootie kicking if
you're beginning to run up against your int cap... We did it with
3 level 60's (I can clear 7th floor solo but when I tried to solo
her she proceeded to reveal that 1) she wasnt amused and 2) she could
summon ;) )

She generally drops 2 items too, and if you dont have the "straight
to level 7" key clearing the other floors can drop some nice surprises
like the teachers syllabus/students homework on level 2, sorcerous
bowl on level 4, etc.
