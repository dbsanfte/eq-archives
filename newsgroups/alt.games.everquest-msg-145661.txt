Sow, schmoe.  Don't need it unless the mobs run at faster than normal run
speed.  I never have any trouble outrunning mobs with my non sow casting
characters.  Strafe running is your friend, at least until you can afford
SoW potions, TBoots, or JBoots.  Even then, it's handy for when SoW breaks
at just the wrong moment.

Admittedly, my harmony experience is limited, but I have never had a problem
with Harmony, then snare pulling.
