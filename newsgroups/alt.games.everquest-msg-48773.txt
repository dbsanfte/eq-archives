Your smithing skill vs. the trivial level of the item you are attempting
is the only thing that affects your likelihood of a successful attempt.
How fast that skill goes up is affected by other things, such as higher
of wis/int and apparently your STR.  At least that's my understanding of
it. Others may feel that STR affects your likelihood of success, but
that's not how I read the information. But play it safe. Have your STR
and your INT or WIS as high as you can get it while smithing. And have
your CHA up high when buying and selling stuff for it.
