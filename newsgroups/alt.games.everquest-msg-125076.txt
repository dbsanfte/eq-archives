Ok, my bad. For some reason when I think "Necro" I think "fear kiting".
The example I gave in ToFS is a good example for both cases. Where the
mob goes on it's death march, since you've effectively won the battle
*is* a concern in some cases, because they might wander into and aggro
more mobs if your party can't snare/root. However, you also can't
control that. I have seen people fearkiting mobs in ToFS into the zone
in wall. I've also /petitioned them for it. 

Now that I stop and think about it, I find it hard to put into words why
that is an exploit and why finishing off a mob on it's death march that
paths the same way isn't, but I just know that this is the case. There
is a difference between the two cases, even if I'm too groggy and short
on coffee to articulate it well.
