 No arguement from me on that point,

 Subconsciencly, this could be true. I just read a post where a Druid was
POed about the AC spawn. The first 10 replies were attacks on a Druid
wanting JBoots. The frenzy then starts like pihrannas. Not one single person
told him how to trigger the AC. Now, I've come to two conclusions about this
JBoots thread.
1- People really don't know how to trigger the AC, thus should not reply.
2- People just like to attack.

Maybe it is a vendetta, hell I am human.


  Tell me, why would anyone take this NG serious ? Regardless of the
presentation, bottom line was the Druid didn't know how , and just wanted to
know. Informative, Helpful, lol   BAH!!  not in here. This NG exist just for
many to show off period. Have I been a rude ass in here ? You bet I have.
Will I continue ? prolly not, cause I get bored easily. Will I continue too
read this NG ?  Yup, because once in a blue moon, someone actually makes
sense. I never said BTW I could better this so called community, its a total
wash. I just did what most people don't. I fought back hard. Many a person
would put his tail between his/her legs and leave for good, because they
wouldn't stoop to the level of some in this NG. They have a rep to uphold I
guess. Me ? lol , just plain don't care what people think. I have about as
much to gain as I do to lose based on the impressions of others.
 If they like me will the give me 2k ? nope
 If they hate me will they give me 2k ? nope

 So tell me again, why should I really care. What exactly am I missing by
not being a member of this great newsgroup ?

 I rest my case :-)

No offense intended, because after reading your replies, I think you know
what I have been saying.

Have a Nice Day
