Hmmmmm..... last guild I was involved with, the main leader left for a
while, handing the reigns of power over to a lady.  She ran things just
fine.

Our third highest ranking officer at the time was also a lady.  They worked
well together.  Except for the actions of some disruptive teenaged boys in
our guild, things ran just fine.

The second, fourth, and fifth most influential officers were men.  Unlike
the teenaged boys, they did not feel threatened by the ladies' power, and
things ran just fine.

A third lady, highly influential in our guild, had the chance to become
guild leader instead.  She turned down the offer for power, and served at a
distance in merely an advisory role.  We wished she would have taken a more
active role, but  things ran just fine (except for the behavior of the
teenaged boys).

We actually became better organized under their leadership, with a good
system of a ballance of power established between the guild leadership, the
officers, and the members.  Under their leadership, we were preparing to
leave behind our image as a perpetual newbie guild.  We grew from a
dictatorship into a representative constitutional monarcy.

Then our guild leader returned from his leave of absence.

He chastised the ladies for how they ran the guild, and overnight he
demolished all the progress they made.  They left.  The leader reinstated
the rules and practices that were dooming us to being little more than a
newbie guild.

The guild distintegrated.

In this case, testoserone, not estrogen, killed it.  The guild leader, and
the teenage boys that followed him unquestioningly, were the ones who tore
it apart.
