Only person got baited was you.

Lets see.

You start by telling Jazz he's wrong and that the cracked is 2hb.

He pauses, and agrees.

I point out that cracked is 1hb and crack a small joke which obviously
went over your head.

you come back with an insulting response to 3 different posters who call
you on being wrong.

I notice that you are on @home and ergo your IP, and state of residence
are easily available. I further suggest you might want to have some
manners when you are hanging out of your trousers.

You tell me "go for it"

I ask if you are giving me permission to probe your machine.

You suggest that I am a small child(hint, I'm not)

I again ask if you are giving consent to access your box.

You Tell me to give it my best shot, and then immediately say that if I
do, you will pursue legal action and suggest that I'm already probing
your box(I haven't and won't without sufficient indication that informed
consent has been given,  I'm a professional Software developer and like
my job and intend to keep it)

I respond by pointing out that its not illegal and a loose
interpretation of your post could consist of consent.  I also point out
in response to your suggestion I have no skills that I know what state
you are in.

You throw out a further challenge to provide your city of residence
along side of a suggestion that pinging your computer would provide your
state.  Hint, It won't.


I trump that with your name, street address, and phone number.

You claim you aren't impressed.

You have just been owned.  It is the most delicate of hacking operations
known as SEing(Social Engineering).  I could have done it with a 300
baud modem and a Tandy 120 with a 3 line display.  Everyone knows you
lost.  Anyone with a clue knows that I could own your box, and you
wouldn't have a legal leg to stand on.  You are likely in violation of
the TOS of @home for inviting me to hack your box while it is on their
network.
