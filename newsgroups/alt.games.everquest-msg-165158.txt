We are discussing Affirmative Action as a program.  If you do not wish to do
so, fine, but don't try to change the terms, mid-stream.

Yes, there are advantages, so what?  Why is it, if someone has a leg up,
everyone else gets pissed off?  Someone who's smarter than I am also has an
edge, should I despise him for his intellegence?  Wealth is transient.  It's
something a parent will spend to get what he can for his child.  In the end,
though, it's only because the parent earned the money that he was able to
spend it.  If I wanted to have the same benefits as a rich man, I make
wealth a priority.  If I wanted to have the same benefits as a black man,
can I change my race?

Only for those who are consumed with envy.

You just don't want to hear what I have to say, do you?
