i made a new wizard a while back (on a different account, so all my chars
can be ported)

having got to 59 previously, i didn't want to do the tedious levels again,
so i devised a plevel method involving my cleric and magician.

cleric - mainly because he can heal, and *doesnt* riposte

Cast mages DS on cleric, cleric pulls a bunch, runs them all back and
stands, with them all beating on him.  Wizzy casts some rain spells (I know
its got a max target, but they die so fast anyway, 2-3 casts means I hit the
whole pull)

With PoTG and KEI, the cleric, wizard and mage didn't have to stop for mana
at any point.  Wiz went from 26-30 in about 2 hours, "soloing" the ill omen
fort (chancellor room)
