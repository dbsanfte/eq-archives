No, Sony wouldn't lose.  I can only imagine the absolute mess that such a
legal precedent would cause for all makers of MMORPGs.  The court would have
to find that the individual player had a property interest in the items and
characters on the game maker's server, and that would also mean that the
game maker would lose considerable control over their own product.  Perhaps
the legal ramifications of such a rule haven't occurred to you.

Server goes down, they need to restore the game world from two days before,
everyone on the server has a legal claim against the company for anything
they may have lost in those two days, as well as for the lost time that they
could have been playing while the company tries to restore the server.

I get banned, I have a legal claim recognized by a court of law.

I lose ingame cash to a bugged merchant or quest, I have a legal claim.

The game maker raises merchant prices on peridots, I have a legal claim.

The game maker nerfs cash drops on certain monsters, I have a legal claim.

They negatively change some items for balance issues, I have a legal claim.

They have to shut the game down because they're losing money, I have a legal
claim.

The possibilities are endless if a court recognizes that the players have a
property interest in the items and characters in the game.

I'm just given the impression that SOE's decided that a lawsuit just wasn't
worth going after.  It's not going to affect their bottom line, so there's
no point to it.
