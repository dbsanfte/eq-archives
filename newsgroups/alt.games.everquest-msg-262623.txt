    There's a lot of creative raids now. A second trial, raid level, MPG:

    The trial has the same geometry as the first (all the trials take place 
in the same zone model). On the center platform is a boss with two Kyv-model 
archers beside it. There are six mobs around the room, perma-rooted, will 
not attack until attacked. As you fight, two sets of emotes will occur. The 
first is received by everyone in the trial, and says something along the 
lines of "An explosion is about to occur. The center of the room looks 
safe." You have a short time to get into the middle of the room before an AE 
goes off, nailing everyone not on the central platform. After the AE goes 
off, you get a second emote about "the air explodes" and you know it's safe 
to go back to fighting.

    The second emote is individual. From time to time, random people in the 
room will get emotes like the following: "Your right hand weapon is heating 
up. You'd best remove it." If you don't remove your weapon from your hand in 
time, you get nailed with a very large DoT/debuff and are told "You burned 
your hand." If you do remove it in time, you get the emote "Your weapon has 
cooled off" and can re-equip the weapon. There's a variety of these emotes - 
your rings are beginning to constrict, an archer is aiming at your head - 
duck!, an archer is aiming at you - better start running, etc. In each case, 
you do what you're told or you get zapped with some very bad effects 
(archers were hitting people with DD's for several thousand damage). As far 
as we can tell, these emotes come at a constant rate per unit time, so as 
you lose people to all the effects going off, the remaining people get hit 
with more and more emotes per unit time. I was one of the last to die, and 
when it happened I was running around the center platform, ducked, with both 
rings and my weapon off trying to stay alive. ;-) It's like Simon Says meets 
EQ!

    The monks fail feign a lot, in that once they feign you can re-target 
them and beat them to death. ;-)

    The group raids raise your stat caps, the individual trials raise your 
resist caps. The successes show up as a brand new AA on your OoW AA list, 
"Trials of Mata Muram", although that's pretty buggy at the moment.

    No, GoD was swill. For every Inktu'ta or Tacvi, with fairly interesting 
encounters, there was a Txevu or Uqua that sucked your desire to play right 
out of you. There were two devs that designed zones in GoD, and you really 
could tell which did which based on the design.

    This is ten times worse. Imagine a trial where your DPS has to come from 
melees that can use blunt, slashing, and piercing weapons to succeed, and 
the time for the trial is so tight that you have room for a cleric healer, a 
shaman slower (for backup healing), and four DPS melee, all four DPS being 
necessary to finish in time. I just described one of the MPG single group 
trials. We have yet to get any group that wasn't cleric, shaman, and four 
times melees that could use at least two of those weapon types through (BST 
was OK, MNK was not). It's horrible design. So you know why the weapon types 
are so important as to exclude casters - you fight three bosses, each one 
vulnerable to one type of melee and invulnerable to the others. The weapons 
that the boss is vulnerable to also cause that boss a great deal of extra 
damage, so casters can't put out the sort of sustained DPS that a melee with 
access to all three weapon types can. And the trials were apparently 
balanced around that level of DPS.
