Wasn't a specific poll, more a gradual gathering of knowledge with Luclin's
impending release causing more discussion of what video cards everyone is
using.  I have a pretty good idea of what 300-ish people are using on
probably 500-ish computers.  A fair sampling of the EQ population.

My guild has some non-Americans and they seem to be about the same as far as
video cards (though often different "brandnames" the cards are the same).
