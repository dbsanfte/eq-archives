I'm guessing that the expansions you bought on Ebay were not just to
get the "full experience" but they included an active toon even if you
didn't come right out and say it.

If your only concern is your 30 Ranger then get new expansions and the
problem is solved. If you are transferring your Ranger to the new
account because there are higher lvl toons on it....don't do it.

I won't get on my soapbox ( I've been killed twice this week by Ebay
toons ) Here is what will happen...You'll log on new toon and find a
group. Group will figure out very quickly that you can't play your
class and you were either PL'd or bought the toon. They will boot you
out of the grp ( hopefully before everyone is killed ) and then never
grp with you again. They'll tell 2 friends and they'll tell 2
friends..you get the picture.  Now you have a toon that can't find a
group and you've wasted your money.

I agree with Verants policy of not allowing accounts to be used by
second person and the first time someone with a toon they bought gets
you killed so will you.
