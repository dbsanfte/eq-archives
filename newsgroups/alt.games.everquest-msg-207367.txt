Two necros would be extremely powerful.  However, playing two characters
of the SAME class would be too odd, if not boring.

Don't see many disadvantages with two necros.  The fact is the necro class
is
extremely powerful on its own.  Since the DOT stacking changes, two necros
would break all hell loose.

Nice suggestion.

Cheers
