Uhhhh. No. I don't generally like those kinds of films, and in fact never
saw Titanic. (I knew how it ended) And I'm not even close to being a
teenager at 51 :) I never go and see films over and over again either. This
was the first one that EVER sucked me in that way.
The movie LoTR, for whatever reason, makes me feel peaceful. That's it.
Yeah, I like looking at Legolas, but the whole thing just makes me FEEL
good, and there are few things in my life at the moment that do. So I don't
feel badly about that.
