That's my point to some extent.... what is the point of others even
doing their epic.  Their reward is not as useful as the berzerker
epic.  Hell, my beastlord bagged his epic within six months of getting
it.  That's horrible.    So, Why does anyone bother?  As we all know
they do still bother.   And simply by your sentence "nobody would
bother"... people still bother... so again either the Zerk epic is
over the top and needs to be on par with others...  or other epics
just suck and need to be on par with the zerk epic.

 
  epic[1,adjective]epic[2,noun]beast epic epic simile   

Main Entry:

1 : a long narrative poem in elevated style recounting the deeds of a
legendary or historical hero <the Iliad and the Odyssey are epics>
2 : a work of art (as a novel or drama) that resembles or suggests an
epic
3 : a series of events or body of legend or tradition thought to form
the proper subject of an epic <the winning of the West was a great
American epic>  
4 a : extending beyond the usual or ordinary especially in size or
scope <his genius was epic -- Times Literary Supplement> b : HEROIC

in my eyes... a HEROIC item should not be put away... except for
special circumstances...
