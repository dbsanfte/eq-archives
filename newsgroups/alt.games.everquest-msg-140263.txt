Spirocs including the Warrior/Lightbringer on Ogre/Spiroc/Outpost Island
will get you to 55, thats what gimp is doing presently.

Yeah, Gimp is still level 54, but for those that would mock I consider that
an achievement and not an emabarrassment given his unressed death rate.

Things to watch, the Spiroc Warrior is actually Shaman based so don't be
surprised when he starts casting if fear wears off and even if he gates back
to spawn spot. His Lil dog-dog is a mere annoyance, sent your Gimp into him
and don't pull the Warrior to you and the Lil dog-dog will stay on your
Gimp. If Gimp become preoccupied with dog-dog, let him, he will finish
quickly and get back to the main task at hand. A Serpentine bracer (cheap
Extend Affliction 2 item) means your fear and darkeness last longer than
usual anyhow so there is no rush.

The lightbringer is a real bitch. Don't attempt pulling without a full mana
pool as it is a Cleric mob with a <huge> bucket of HP and a nasty tendancy
to heal itself majorly (and I swear it has Layed Hands a few times too) if
you let fear drop for a mere second. You need an entire manapool to take him
out even if he's feared  -splurt and envenomed bolt repeatedly of course,
reapply darkness when needed and fear before needed.

Two warriors spawn which are placeholders for the rare lightbringer. Loot is
crap - words and 1-6 plat.
