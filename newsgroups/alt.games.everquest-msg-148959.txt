Thats just the sort of thing I'm talking about there.  Spell you cast a lot
becomes your high specialized spell, unless you deliberately make it
otherwise.  What you could have done was to sit and chain cast your cheapest
fastest cycling evocation spell (on yourself or your pet or whatever) until
it went over 50 first.  Alternately, once evoc got up to 50 naturally, you
could have done the "reset" quest, cast evoc based spell on your self
five or ten times till it went to 51, and gone on from there.

Its possible that Alteration is your best specialization, of course, but you
arrived at that entirely by accident, in just the sort of way I outlined.
