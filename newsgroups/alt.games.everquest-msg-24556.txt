You are sure about that? They haven't got into the 50's themselves and
decided that isn't for them? Or, if they have done that and they still
prefer the 20 - 45 game (or whatever) they must be just stupid OR, maybe
they have a different opinion to you...ever considered that when personal
taste comes into question there is rarely a right or wrong.

Ahh the desire to join an "uber" guild, looks like that is where we'll
differ.
I don't have that desire, if that is where you enjoy the game, good for you
but don't suppose that because others don't share your ambition with in the
game they are not enjoying it.

Everquest to me and many others is a way to chill out. I certainly have no
intention of worrying about getting to xx level so I can join up with the EQ
l33t and take down such and such a mob. Not that that is a bad way to play,
in a way it is admirable, providing you then don't think that because you
have done such a thing you are any better than anyone else, or your opinion
matters more.
I've played the "High End" of other computer games. I had loads of fun but I
enjoyed it so much due to the people I was with, not the level I was playing
at.
Although I am some what proud of playing for that clan I'll never get so
full of myself as to tell someone on a newbie FFA server they don't know how
to enjoy the game.

Good luck with your goals
