Most common screw ups:

During the escort stage boxing the Gnome in making him warp "home" at which
point yard trash ganks him.  Clear a path for him, don't crowd him.

-or-

People using F8.  Blur and newspaper across the nose until they stop.

-or-

Letting him die to enrage at the Dragon fight itself, have the MT flip the
Dragon so he isn't in the frontal arc.

-or-

Messing about with mez/charm at any point in the proceedings and causing
the Gnome to warp home, poof, not give out flags etc.  If someone isn't
paying attention and you DO somehow get aggro from him then newspaper/ blur
until he carries on.  At the fight itself he needs to be fighting the
Dragon to issue flags, don't worry he can take some hits and doesn't seem
to be affected by the AoE, just make sure he isn't eaten by Enrage.  

The AoE wasn't that severe at all, 800 DD or something and not that
frequent, I was able to heal myself sufficiently with Chloroblast.  I
cannot say how hard he melees as I was some distance away from him the
entire fight.  If you do win then rez the dead quickly so they can get
flagged, you need to be quite close to him for the Hail to get you a flag
and he doesn't stick around forever.
