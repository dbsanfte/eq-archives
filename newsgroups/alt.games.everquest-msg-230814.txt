Never ran into any problems with idiots there, but then, I don't hunt 
anywhere near a zoneline.  It may be ugly, but, the xp sure beats LoIO 
xp.  Did I mention it's easy to solo there?  My 25 enchanter was playing 
around there last night with her pet Greyhopper, had a blast.  Her most 
uber piece of gear is a Shardtooth's flayed skin.  No INT or CHA, but 
35hp is nice.
