Wouldn't be the first time Verant hasn't itemised a Mobs loot because they
think nobody's going to kill it. :o)

I've never even been logged onto a server at the same time as The Sleeper is
rampaging about, much less actually been there to see it happen... can
someone just give a quick rundown on what goes on? And is there enough of a
window before he despawns to organise a ManaBurn attack? (assuming there's a
server other than KB where he still hasn't been woken).
