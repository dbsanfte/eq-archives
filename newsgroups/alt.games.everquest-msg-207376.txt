    You have to look at what else you can get to do the comparison right.
For a monk, SCHW plus Spider Fur Belt is better than FBSS and whatever
similar-cost gloves they can get. For a ranger, SCHW plus Spider Fur Belt is
pretty close to FBSS plus those cheap Leaf-whatever gauntlets in terms of
stats (if the ranger isn't hit by the recommended level). For a warrior,
FBSS plus Cobalt Gauntlets has higher combined AC than SCHW plus Spider Fur
Belt and might be the better choice.

    As my warrior example showed, you have to look at the total picture and
not just compare the two haste items directly.
