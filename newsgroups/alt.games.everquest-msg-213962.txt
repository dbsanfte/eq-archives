I expect nothing, well no, I expect it will indeed be quite easy to get
groups shortly after release, as everyone that just plunked down their hard
earned goes and tries it out.  But in the long run, ease of getting groups
will be based on how popular doing the dungeons turns out to be, instead of
there being a great pool of people who's express purpose is to try the
dungeons out.  Your experience on the beta test will probably mirror the
next few weeks of play... but may have no bearing on the long run.  Try
getting a group in most of LOY.

Oh, snap!  I almost took that seriously, until I realized you couldn't
possibly mean that, and that therefore the complaint itself was sarcasm!

Or if I'm wrong, pretend my comment above was sarcastic.  Win win.
