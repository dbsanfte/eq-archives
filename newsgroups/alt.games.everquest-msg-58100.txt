If they do it'll be either on their website:
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/
(www.everquest.com is virtually worthless and a total waste of bandwidth)

or on their message board:
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi

Sony's store has the release date on 12/4 still.

These are the only sources worth believing.  There's no reason why beta
users would be told more accurate stuff than we are.  Hell, they don't tell
their PAID EMPLOYEES any more than they absolutely have to about ANYTHING.
