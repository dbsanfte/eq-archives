Which has a strong influence on the price, naturally.  Whenever you have
something that is both hard to get and also much wanted, you *should* expect
high prices.  I think that anyone that says prices are too high is either:
1.  Ignorant of the facts of life re:supply and demand
2. Unclear about how difficult the item is to get
3. a beggar
Perhaps Geoff was giving the OP the benefit of the doubt and assumed #2 was
true and was telling him to go get enlightenment.
