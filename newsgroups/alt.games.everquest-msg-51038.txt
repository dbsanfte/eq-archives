Well, thats because Norton still keeps a couple processes (at least) running
even when you've disabled the autoprotect on start-up.

Best thing kids, before running a session of EQ - IF you're having
problems - is to just do a Start/Run and type in msconfig - and OK it.  (I
don't think you'll have this util available in NT/2k/XP) *scratch that I do
have it in XP anyway...

Theres a tab on this dialogue sheet that says Startup - go look at it - and
you decide what to do.  I can pretty much assure you really can't stop
Windows itself from loading by unchecking every box you find, but may render
some of your peripherals unusable without drivers loaded.

Once you've rebooted after it makes you - come back in to Windows and
immediately open up My Computer and do a Help/About and see what your
resources are at now.

I do this before running EQ and it turns off stuff that I keep loaded to
watch my wittle PC when I'm away and the wife gets on it - like NAV,
Webwasher, Zonealarm etc.  When you're done with that gaming session, run up
the program again (msconfig) - everything should be rechecked, okay it,
reboot voila!  Back to TSR hell!
