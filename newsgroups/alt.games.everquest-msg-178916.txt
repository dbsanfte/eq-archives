    Wolves, Dawnshroud Peaks. I'd snare and fear one away while pet tanked
second, then fear, snare, and DoT the crap out of the second ("DoT the crap
out of" = two applications of VotS, plus snare and VC). Med while pet
murders second, if first comes back it gets feared away again until I'm good
and ready for it. Either it was the resist patch, or stuff there was just
simple to kill, but I rarely had issues landing snare on a yellow there. And
if it's snared, it's dead.
