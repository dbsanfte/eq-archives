I belive Biz is referring to the subsequent drop of the same item, which 
OP said was -not- offered to the same guy who missed getting it the 
first time.

Question being, -if- the guy was "next up" to get the first drop, and 
missed getting it, then why wasn't he first up the next time it 
dropped?  He was the same guy, after all, and it seems like the same 
group was still present, and in fact one of the competition should have 
just moved lower on the totem pole by being awarded 'his' drop.

But reading the OP post more closely, the next drop may not have 
actually been an identical item after all; the initial drop was a bracer 
mold, while the next one was not specified, described only generically 
as "the next plate mold that dropped", presumably not a bracer.

Well, a bracer is a far cry from a breastplate or a pair of legs or... 
well heck, its a different item in a different slot.  There may well 
have been someone else in better standing who didn't need bracer as an 
upgrade but who would benefit more from that arms mold that dropped 
next.  Or someone may have put in for the next drop who didn't submit 
their name for a bracer, and that someone may have been higher on the 
totem pole at the time.

If I could get dibs on a possible BP drop by submitting my name for a 
bracer drop and then conveniently going afk and missing looting it, well 
heck, sign me up!

So it sounds on closer reading like the guy who dropped out based on 
this was indeed either spoiling for an excuse, or too dense to be 
allowed to live, unless of course he's playing an ogre.
