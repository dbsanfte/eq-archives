I recently went into the Uldaman instance dungeon with several friends. 
We ranged from levels 43-49; given that my highest-level quest in there
was tagged 44, I expected an easy time of it.  We did well enough up to
the end boss, where we proceded to have our collective butts handed to
us.  So, yes, it definitely gets harder if you're willing to seek out
challenges.

If you haven't done it already, you may want to try the Deadmines
instance--from what I hear, it's a good challenge for a group of five
people around level 20.

I honestly haven't met a single person in WoW who was killing mobs with
the intent to get xp, rather than to complete quests.  I'm certain
there are some out there, but it doesn't seem to be how most people
play the game.

At level 60.  Since there aren't that many people at the level cap yet,
it's only the uber guilds taking part in them so far.

Onyxia (a dragon) is the current raid-to-beat; I believe a guild in
Korea has managed to kill her, but no North American guilds have yet. 
There's also Molten Core, which is supposed to be even harder.  I think
there may be one or two other raids currently available.  It'll be a
while before I can think about getting involved in them, so I'm rather
foggy on the details.

There's a fair bit of information on WoW raids here:
