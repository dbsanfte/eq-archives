I'm no Cleric, but I'll annoy you with my answer anyway.

Don't torture yourself too much, it'd be a real shame to lose a
perfectionist Cleric to overstress.  Clerics like you are rarely
appreciated until you're not there and people discover that it's
not half so easy when you have to work with the second team.  As
a tank, one thing I really want to be able to do is to trust my
life to the healer.  As a Paladin, the last thing I want to have
to do is watch my health bar too.  After reading your story there
I am certain that, short of a 6 mob overpull, I never would have
that as a problem if you were the healer.

In a way, it's good that it bothers you, because that motivates
you to maintain and if possible improve your performance.  But don't
let it be more than a goad to that end, it's not worth the heartburn.
