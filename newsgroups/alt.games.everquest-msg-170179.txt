That's just it.  The way a character is played often has more to do with 
how things go than what class it is.  I've seen great rangers and great 
druids.  It depends on the person at the keyboard.

I often find my druid unrewarding to play in a large group because I 
have little to do.  However if a group needs both a puller and a healer, 
a druid can sometimes fill both roles.
