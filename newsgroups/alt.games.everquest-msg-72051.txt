I use the F10 full screen mode with the transparent windows. I was
wondering if there was a way to darken only the small window you get
when you right click on an item? Whenever I try and look at an item,
the window pops up right over my inventory window, and it's
semitransparent, so the white text from the window underneath shows
through and makes it hard to read. I know you can darken the windows
independantly, because my text and inventory windows are much darker
than the other windows on my screen, but I can't remember how I did
it. Anyone know?
