Tonight on AB (Sun 8th), two of us in Upper Guk got zero spell-casting 
ability - just "Spell recovery time not yet met" for some, and instant 
cancel for others (casting bar appears then vanishes in about 2 pixels' 
time). If it was just me, I'd figure stuck-key syndrome, but it was both 
of us. Logging out and back in fixed it. Noone else in the zone responded 
to a request for similar experience, but a monk in the Guild had a timer 
break (4 million seconds to next FD or something).

Seems something's up with AB if nothing else.
