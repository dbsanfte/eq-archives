The main difference is that in here, you will get flamed for it and 
alienate people who might otherwise be helpful.  Now, is top-posting really 
worth that?

By the way, I fixed your top-post and replaced the attribution line you 
should have kept.

}(notice... NO question mark!)

Yes, that makes it ungrammatical.

}Uber made a comment and at the same time
}asked a question.  You two twits began the flaming!

Uber made a whine, and a whiny question, both of which we have heard a 
thousand times before, and top-posted it.
