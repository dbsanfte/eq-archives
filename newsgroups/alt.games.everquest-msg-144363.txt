"Common" crime affects all of society (the streets are less safe
for everyone) where "hate" crime targets a portion of society
(the streets are less safe for members of a specific group.)
A person who walks in an area of high crime doesn't feel safe,
regardless of who they are.  That same person might feel perfectly
safe walking in an area well-known for specific hate crimes.

For example, there are areas in New York City well known as
bastions of racial hatred and racially-based crimes.  There
are other areas just as well known for simply being extremely
high crime areas.  No one feels safe in the South Bronx, to
give a stereotypical example.  Lots of people feel safe in the
(hyphenated name I can't recall right now, B...-Sty.... for
initials, IIRC) area.  Or, even more radical, a Jewish person
on the streets in Nazi Germany certainly felt extremely unsafe.
The average citizen, however, the bulwark of society, probably
felt quite safe from street crime.

The recent events in Salt Lake City and California (children
being abducted and murdered), for example, have had a far more
profound effect on general society than the Matthew Shepherd case.
The average citizen was bothered by the Shepherd case because it
was an especially brutal, senseless killing but felt little
personal threat.  That same average, 2.1 children, citizen feels
his children are less secure today than they were a few months
ago.

So "common" crime is more disruptive to society as a whole,
correct?  And, as being more disruptive and because it affects a
greater number of people, shouldn't it be punished more?
