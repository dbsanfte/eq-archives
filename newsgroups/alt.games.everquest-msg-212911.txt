I would have to differ. Certainly client side issues are harder to test, 
and we can expect *some* issues, but these should be limited to 
crashing, distorted graphics, lag, disconnects, etc.

FAR FAR FAR too many of the bugs that crop up are server side, and this 
is an environment they do have complete control over. From forgetting to 
think about the consequences of "new feature X" on an alt-rules sever, 
to bungling up character records with an expansion, to simple broken 
quests, (broken npcs, missing spawns, required loot that wasn't included 
in anybodies drop tables, items nobody can wear, and don't forget the 
fiasco with alchemy when it wasn't obtainable...

lets face it the validation process leaves quite a bit to be desired.

How does an item that no one can use get into the game? Seriously. Two 
days later its "fixed"... great... but it shouldn't have made it live in 
the first place.
