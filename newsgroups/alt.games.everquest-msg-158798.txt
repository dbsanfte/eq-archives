He's got a point, though.  Suppose it takes 5 hours at 100% to get an AA
point, and 15 hours at 100% regular to get the next level.  At a 50/50
split, here's what your next 30 hours look like:

    hour 10     AA point
    hour 20     AA point
    hour 30     AA point, ding 62

If you instead did 100% AA for 15 hours, then 100% regular, it would look
like this:

    hour 5      AA point
    hour 10     AA point
    hour 15     AA point
    hour 30     ding 62

By doing 100% until you have all three AA points, then doing 100% toward
leveling, you get to level 62 at the same time, but you have the first AA
point 5 hours earlier, that second point 10 hours earlier, and the third 15
hours earlier.

This same thing happens for other AA/leveling times other than 5 hrs/15 hrs.
