I built a new starter system for a friend of mine 
to play EQ on. It has:

Intel Celeron 533 CPU

BCM IN620 Mainboard (SiS 620/5595 AGP/PCI/ISA 
chipset, 64bit graphics, 133MHz 8MB) allegedly 
Direct3D Compliant

Crucial 128 MB SDRAM, PC100/133 CL3

ESS 1938 Solo-1 Onboard PCI Audio

Western Digital 6.4GB IDE HDD as Primary Master

IDE CD-ROM as Secondary Master

3.5" Floppy

VQF 1456-x Internal Hardware ISA modem, flashed to 
v.90 (connects at 53333 every time!)

Windows 98 first edition

EQ & Ruins of Kunark Combo Pack

We tried for several hours to register the new 
account and it kept failing. When submitting the 
credit card billing info, it repeatedly kept 
dumping us at an error box saying pretty 
much,"your subscription could not be created 
..yada yada.. your GAME CARD IS EXPIRED or INVALID"!

GAME CARD??? What exactly are they trying to tell 
me here? I've searched Google nad I don't know 
how many other EQ sites and I've found *no* 
reference whatsoever to "game cards", expired or 
invalid or otherwise! I'm lost! My friends who 
play EQ are lost on this one too!

I can deduce (probably incorrectly) that this is 
perhaps a problem with either the credit card info 
or the 3d accelerator card?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
