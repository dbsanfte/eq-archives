Where and how much is that sort of deal, here we are paying $60 a month for
128k up and 1 meg down. Are those rates guaranteed regardless of load?

Here we are gauranteed our full pitiful bandwidth, but I remember other
systems could offer 3-4 mbps peak only if the system wasn't loaded down with
users.

I could maybe host quake or duke3d, but even half life would choke at more
than 3 players on my connection. I don't have the bandwidth to host even one
player for a game like bf1942.
