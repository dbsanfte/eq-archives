I have exactly the same problem.  What kind of machine do you have?

I've got:

MSI K7T266 Pro2 Motherboard
AMD Athlon 1.47 GHz CPU
512 MB ECC DDR RAM
Windows 98
Gforce3 Video Card
Soundblaster Live (circa 2000 - I don't get their model names these days)
sound card
DSL Connection

As far as I know, all drivers and Direct X are up to date.
