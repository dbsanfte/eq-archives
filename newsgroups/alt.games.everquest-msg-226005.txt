Well, that was the only reason I could see.  Davian's that is.

You would do better to swap before medding, as any reduction in your mana 
pool will reduce the amount of mana you have, regardless of having just 
medded up to full at 255 wisdom.  If you are going to be playing with 235 
wisdom, say, then med to full at 235 wisdom, it will take less time, and 
you will have the same net mana pool as you get by swapping gear down to 
235 wisdom after medding to full at 255.  That is the point that I 
believe all concerned here were trying to make.
