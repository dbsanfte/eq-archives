Of course the other factor would be the rate at which the proc checks
are successful.  This rate seems to be affected by dex.  For the
cleric hammer series, it seems to me the proc timer remains constant
but the proc success rate goes up with better hammers.  In either
case, there is a marked difference in proc rate with a higher dex,
which Yaulp V helpfully provides.
