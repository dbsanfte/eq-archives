if he didn't put all his bonuspoints into int, let him play find a new role
to fill in. I mae a hef dru myself split all the bonuspoints nicely except
in int and wis. (thought those would be high by nature on such a char and
yes i was clueless) Now i'm a dru 54 and i'm used to being always 00m if i
stick to standard role. But i can take a few hits and do a bit of melee.
different assigned bonuspoints and not an obvious race can lead to verry
different benefits as well.
