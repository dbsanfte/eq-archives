4 things you need to know about melee skillups:
1. Every swing is a chance for s killup
2. Every hit has an increased chance for a skillup over a miss
3. Chance for a skillup increases with more dex
4. You can only get skillups on mobs who will give you exp

So basically you want to fight light-blue mobs (more chance to hit, but
still give exp) with the fastest weapon (damage doesn't matter) you can find
of your skill-to-be-upgraded. Also try to get some nice shammie or chanter
dex buffs and a haste.

Now the best way is to get a low delay weapon with bad damage and go to an
exp zone where stuff is just a bit under your level. Then ask a local exp
group if you can increase your weapon skills on their mobs. Most groups have
no problem with that considering you won't do enough to KS them, but still
help out a bit by some extra damage.
