I'm in UK on 56k and its very playable. also EQ has a new server, Antonious
bayle which is a European server so I expect less lag. The concept of te
game is thus:

You play a character who kills monsters and such around the world of Norrath
and her Moon Luclin. Mainly you fight monsters (mobs) but can duel a fellow
player character (PC) or NPC(Non Player character), the later happening a
lot. People cant juist rape newbies, u have to consent to duel.

When you die your corpse last so long at the place u died, depending on your
current level. maximum is about 7 days in RL (as long as u arent in game, if
u r in game its just 30 mins). Also when u die, u are 'reincarnated' at the
point u r bound. This is either the city u begun in or else where u got a
bind. a bind is a spell which moves ur respawn (reincarnation) point to a
new place. This has to be a city in most cases. So yes
>>>"you get warped back somewhere else, minus anything you where carrying?"
Once ur respawned run back to where u died and loot ur corpse, getting ur
stuff back. You will lose some xp by dying, more the higher level u r.

XP is experience, which is gained via killing anything which isnt green to
u. if u right click on a mob at a distance for safty, then u get a message
in a coloured text. green means u win certainly win unless u just stand
around for about an hour lol. light blue means u will liekly win but not
guaranteed. Dark blue is a good fit u can win but will hurt. White means the
mob is same level as u, hard fight. Yellow, Red or Black means u dont have a
chance,....run away now.

Cheating is very hard to do by nature of the game., and is serverly punished
by game makes Verant. U can twink u payer by getting high level items or
lots of money from say a friend or maybe another character of ur own. These
items u couldnt get at ur current level due to difficulty involved or cost,
so its *sorta* cheating but we all do it lol, well most of us.

There are also guilds, like Clans for games like Counter-Strike etc. These
may also twink you if u ask nice :)

Anythig else ?

Oh yeah, everquest is the best MMRPG ever hahaha its so much fun once u get
into it. When u start, scared and alone and unsure what "WTB" or "KOS" means
its daunting but plead for help, like i did. A nice high level payer taught
me how to do spells, bought me things to get me started (on my Necromancer).
After that i was independent, so my warrior is may more fun. Read the guide
u get with game thouroghly. Might be worth buying Prima's secrets of EQ. and
then theres NGs like this where u can ask for help. Also a large web
community...such as www.eqatlas.com, www.eqprices.com and www.eqtraders.com

It takes a while to get into. I have collectiviyl over 60 levels, yet only
yesterday I found out about something totally new (disciplines for my 30
warrior).

Purchasing: U might as well buy the new pack with EQ, Kunark, Velious and
Luclin in. U dont have to use xpansions until ur rdy. i got Kunark & velious
with my game and have never been to Velious. If u wanna use Luclin, u need a
min of 256mb ram to get benefit.

Other than that, all i can say is go out and get it, about �30, and
enjoy...prepare to get addicted. Monthly fee is $10...�7.58 i think, or less
if u pay like for 3 months. Your first month is free AND I think theres a
new demo available on cover discs of magazines or maybe to download from
www.everquest.com Demo is free so u can get to see if u will like EQ. I got
full EQ about 9 months back on the recommendations of a friend and its the
best �30 i ever spent IMHO!
