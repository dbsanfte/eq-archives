Fungis don't go linkdead.

Fungis don't go OOM

Fungis don't sometimes do 50% of the damage and take the kill

Fungis have no faction issues

The fungi is on your timetable, you are not subject to its whims.

You don't have to suck up to the fungi or beg it to help you

Fungis are never 20 zones away and already in a group.

Do not taunt happy fun fungi.
