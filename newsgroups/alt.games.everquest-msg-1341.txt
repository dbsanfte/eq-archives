 Well as you gain levels you may want to start snaring a little earlier
than when they start to run. Some of the mobs will have SoW and high
Magic Resist. One snare resist will be enough for them to get too far
away and bring a train back. I'd recommend snaring when the mobs are
around 50% health but I suppose that's a matter of personal preference.
