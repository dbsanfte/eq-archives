for a 31 wizard who will be played (casually, probably not to 51+3aa anytime
soon) just enough to require a reliable self-speed boost, what would you all
recommend?

1)lots and lots and lots of sow pots
-pay as you go, a nice way to do it....also cheapest and highest quality
speed...

2)a horse (the cheapest one is all i feel like buying)
-i don't kite, i group....and i invis myself frequently, so it's not so much
aggro as it is that i'm always medding

3)jboots
-probably too lazy and untrusting to do this

4)tboots
-easy, don't actually know anyone with them....do they really exist anymore?
=p

thanks
