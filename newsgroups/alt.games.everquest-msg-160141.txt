While I didn't mention it, this is a Halfling cleric, so I do get hide.
However, Hide skill is fixed at 50, and with hide/sneak enabled
I still sometimes get attacked by wandering MOBs. <shrug>.
Still, I'm safer than the average cleric, I suppose.

Hmm... nice item. Have to see if I can get hold of one. It looks
like most of the required crafting items aren't too hard to
organise, but the required Pottery tradeskill would be a problem.
Suppose I could buy in bazaar if there's any up for sale, which
I doubt.

I've always wanted something like this... and with PoK it
would take just a few minutes to get to almost any major city.
