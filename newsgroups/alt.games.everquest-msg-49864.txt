My question is How do I make a better Knight.

  I am now a level 54 Paladin, soon to be level 55.  I have been
avoiding Planes raids, primarily because I want to make level 55 and I
do not feel prepared for Planes raids.

   This weekend I went with a team of mid 50s players to the Hole.
Everything went fine made some plat, and EXP, unfortunately the
Enchanter bailed on us so the session was way to short.

   The puller was a level 56 Warrior. What bothered me, was that I
felt kind of useless.
I was using a Mithril 2hs which does pretty decent damage and I was
casting the 125 DD. I asked the warrior if he wanted me to Taunt and
he asked me what my AC was. I said 975; he said, too low don't worry
about taunting.  I could have switched to my  Clay Guardian Shield and
my Wurmslayer, and got my AC over 1000. I could have bashed and stuned
and tried to get agro. 
My impression was that really was not needed.  The warrior said just
use the weapon which does the most damage.  Given the number of hit
points of the mobs I felt the damage I was doing may have helped but
was not essential.  I kept asking myself why would this group select a
54 Paladin to join if I rogue, ranger or second warrior was available.

       I am asking those Paladins who have continued to advance their
characters beyond 54 and 55, what should I do to be more useful. How
should I advance my character now.


     I have pretty decent Armor, four pieces of Deepwater.  I have
adequate weapons. I do not see any upgrade that is reasonably priced,
camped for or qwested which would help much.
The three I can think of  the goblins earring the grachnist in
warsilks, or the Aegis of life, or the fishbone earring seem to be
worth the time and effort.
      I guess I could go after the FBSS to give my Wurmslayer greater
damage output.
      I have been thinking about resist gear. The best I can determine
from researching the internet is that, the one I should focus on is
Magic Resistance, primarily to prevent being feared when raiding the
plane of fear.

     My impression is though, that it is a matter of tactics not
equipment.  I have spent most of my life as a self healing Tank. Kind
of a warrior wannabe.  I think I need to develop other skills to be
valuable to the higher level teams and the planes raiding teams, I am
now encountering.

	Any suggestions, and insights would be greatly appreciated.
				Thank You.
