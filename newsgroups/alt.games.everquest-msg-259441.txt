You have to either sell all, and split before that happens, or attempt to 
be fair by splitting the cash, and the drops at that point, then change 
the group makeup.

In practice, what I see usually happen, is gem drops are given out in 
alphabetical order as the drop, cash is split when someone leaves, and, 
anyone leaving early is usually SOL on any other cash loot items like 
research materials and such.  When I am MLing, if I am leaving, I will 
gate out, sell, return to the group (if practical), and hand over their 
split.  If it is not practical to return to the group, then I will try to 
be fair about any drops I got to the extent possible, and just hand them 
out to group members, randoming where appropriate.
