Thats my whole point.  Its a flaw in the game, a flaw in the AC system, NOT

Dont get hit much?  Low wight AC bonus?
You mean that 6% avoidance bonus we have, in comparison to a warrior
weighing TEN times what we do?
Btw AoW hits me for max damage almost every single blow. What mitigation or
"blows doing little damage" ?
