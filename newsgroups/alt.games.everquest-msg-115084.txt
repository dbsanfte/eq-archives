The Appointed has been around for some time now.  Loot is distrubted
randomly on a NBG basis.  It seems to work fine for us.  TA is certainly far
from an uber guild, it's more intended for casual players who like to have
fun playing. We do raids similar to Jazz's guild.  Most mains in the guild
are 50+, only one level 60 in the guild, a scattering of very high 50s,
quite a few low to mid 50s, and some below that.
