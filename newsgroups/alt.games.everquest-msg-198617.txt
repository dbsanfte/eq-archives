Hi,

I bought EQ a couple of weeks ago and have logged on about 6 times in this 
period - half of which I've come across this damned patching they keep 
doing.  Is it always like this or have I just run into a busy patching time?  
I like the game but don't feel like going beyond the free subscription 
period if I can't access the game half the time!

Sorry if I sound pissed but they patched it last week, then the day after 
and today when I finally got some time off work and was hoping to have a 
marathon stint on EQ they patch the freakin thing again!!

Mike
