Hey, everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but I personally was hooked
after playing for an hour.  I mean, yeah, the content at the beginning isn't
near as fun as it is when you lvl up but I enjoyed the social interaction,
roleplaying, running around killing monsters, playing with my spells to see
what they did, even falling off the Kelethin treehouses when I foolishly got
drunk one day and tried to find the orc lift :)

It's not as fun at the beginning but the things that make the game unique --
that is, raising a character from a "baby" to a force to be reckoned with in
the context of a world full of other players -- are there from the start.
Plenty of games have things to kill, and kill in more fun and imaginative
ways than EQ at that.  Without the world of players it would be nothing more
than a glorified fantasy-style FPS.  So to say that he shouldn't be expected
to enjoy the game just because he hasn't seen all the cool mobs to kill and
stuff to loot -- well, he's probably better off playing a single-player game
somewhere like NWN.
