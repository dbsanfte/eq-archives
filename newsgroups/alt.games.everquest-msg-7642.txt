I think my biggest complaint with that (I'm fairly new so I haven't created 
a lot of complaints yet *lol*) is when there's a train going through and us 
little people (Level 10 Rogue, I was level 8 at the time) are trying to run 
like mad to get the hell out of there and someone is standing in the 
doorway casting and *none* of us can get out. Last time that happened about 
4 people (including one I was with) died at that spot while madly typing 
"move, move we can't get out for the love of god move!" I barely made it 
out with one bubble left after I guess he finally moved.

Just my B.B. beef :)
