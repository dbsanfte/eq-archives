www.mypollingsite.com for one, a bit slow to respond, but seems pretty 
decent.  In my case, it puts me at my county website, where it took me a 
few moments to find the polling place information, I had to check my 
voter registration info first, and on that it had an address and a Map It 
button for my polling place.  When I hit map it, it came up with an 
aerial view picture of the area with street names overlayed on it.  I was 
quite impressed actually.  It also let me see a sample ballot for my 
particular polling place.  If I had to guess, I'd say the quality of the 
results will vary a lot depending on the quality of the websites of the 
governments in question.  I randomly picked one in West Virginia, and all 
I got was a list of addresses for county clerks and phone numbers for 
them.  I would guess that you would be best off starting with your local 
government's website, state or county, and work from there.

www.mypollingplace.org is another, probably got too busy though, as it 
appears to be down.

Looks like the NRA has some type of polling site locator as well, did not 
go there to actually check it out though, just saw a blurb via a google 
search.
