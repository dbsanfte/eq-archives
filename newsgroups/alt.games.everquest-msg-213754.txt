So, got my little group over to ME last night.  We were by the DL zone
pulling Xi Vius  and Xi Xaui trying to get SoE or Foliage Shield to drop.
Khazam's says that they're supposedly common drops, but didn't see either
all night.  Probably killed about 10 or so of each one, and most we got was
a few Essence of Darkness and some Swirling Shadows.

Anyone know the drop rate of SoE?  Is it really a rare drop, or were just
REALLY unlucky?
