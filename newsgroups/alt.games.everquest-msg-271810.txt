Actually, "zones" in literature and other media predate EQ by
decades.  That would include escaping from hostiles by "zoning".
While it's true that alternate realities and/or pocket universes
were most often the excuse given, but that's hardly less unreal,
and the fundamental mechanic: the escapees have the means to
"cross over" while the pursuers do not, is identical.

IOW, I'm with bizbee.  I see no more (or less) difficulty ignoring
the unreality of EQ's zones than I do ignoring the unreality of
various gates, teleporters, "transporters", time-cycles (reread
"The Shield of Time" recently, not one of Anderson's best efforts),
and what have you, found throughout fantasy literature and movies.

Of course, it'd be a lot more fun if the bad guys did manage to
continue pursuit from time to time, unrelenting sameness is boring.
