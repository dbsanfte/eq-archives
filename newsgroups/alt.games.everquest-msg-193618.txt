FINALLY!!!...the Rock has come back to Alt...back to Alt...back to
alternately kick DT's ass.

(Boo's and Jeer's from the peanut gallery)

No, no, don't get mad, you see the Rock he understands DT.
No, seriously the Rock knows, the Rock....knows.
The Rock knows what its like to be hated, to be picked on, to have
people dislike the Rock, but that's ok, it's all good.
Because you see , the Rock and DT have something in common.
Something in common that none of you jabronies have. And  that is that
we have done it all,. Done it all!!! You see the Rock has done it all
and so has DT, yes he has, done it all in EQ.
He gets home, runs to his computer, yeah you do, you get your Diet
Pepsi,  you got to keep in shape, the Rock knows about computers and
getting out of shape. So you get your diet Pepsi, or Coke or your
Milk, yeah the Rock loves milk, loves it. Loves it with his pie, oh
yeah!! Then you get you little mouse and double click on that little
EQ icon on your desktop, the one with Buffy the Vampire Slayer on it,
Yeah the Rock knows you do, yeah he does. Then you log on, type your
little password, pick your little character on your screen and he's
dancing around. But you, like the Rock have done it all, yeah. Done it
all!!
So you just ignore them , ignore those jabronies. Their just jealous,
jealous of you, yeah the Rock knows about people being jealous.
Some people hate the Rock like they hate you, always picking on you.
But thats OK, that's OK.
So you just keep  Hill Giant slashin', froglok bashin', Kobold
mashin', Lord Nagafen harrasin', desktop crashin', Oh Yeah, the Rock
knows about desktop crashing, So if you ever need help just ask the
Rock, yeah the Rock will be glad to help DT out, Glad to help. Just
send the Rock a tell, I'll be working on my pie baking skills.

IF YOU SMELL...What the Rock..Is cooking.....
