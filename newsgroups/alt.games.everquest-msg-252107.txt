I didn't say that a cleric couldn't do it, I said -she- can't do it. 
Not everyone in the game is working with a full skill set, if you know 
what I mean!

Heck, I also carry a bag full of Stalking Probes, could have hooked her 
up with a few of those and let her Zomm herself.  But using my own no 
charges consumed, no mana consumed, I'm used to it eye seemed like a no 
risk proposition... I just hadn't considered the perils of the standing 
thing.

Splendid
