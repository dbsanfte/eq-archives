If I look at from a straight kills-per-hour basis, unless you're
talking about nothing but single pulls I don't think 80m = 40m. The
most obvious example would be the crowd control classes. If a shaman
doesn't have the mana to slow all the mobs in a pull or the enchanter
doesn't have the mana to mez all the adds, the fact that you didn't
start off with enough mana will impact the efficiency of your group,
whether you die or not. 

To a lesser extent, the same goes for a nuker. For example, if you
have a pull of three mobs, it's more efficient (for the group) to nuke
the first one down hard and just med through the last two than it is
to nuke once on each. 

Another example, if you're a druid and playing backup healer/nuker,
it's more efficient for you to keep a relatively large mana reserve.
That way, if you're cleric has a rough pull and needs to med the group
can still keep going with the druid covering heals for a while. 

The makeup of your group also impacts this a good bit. A melee heavy
group looses DPS if there aren't any mobs in camp being beat on. A
caster heavy group would be just as efficient if they
kill/med/kill/med. 

Overall, I think there's too many variables for you to come up with
many general guidelines. About the only one I can think of is to stay
over 60m unless you have a good reason for running through that extra
mana.
