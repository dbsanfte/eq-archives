Why on earth would I prefer to go through all that just because you can't 
handle the possibility that people are just people and not something of 
which to be overly suspicious? The world doesn't operate according to 
your tidy little protocols, bud. Get use to it.

Your whole complaint and criticism here is based solely on that. How can 
you say no one is saying as much?!

And again, you give substance to what you've claimed above that you 
don't. Why should you consider my opinion? Why *shouldn't* you? It's 
ridiculous to assume that everyone who posts under an alias merely does 
so to allow them to act in a dishonest manner. Aliases have been a part 
of Usenet much longer than their abuse.

Perhaps it should now be established that those who post under their 
"real" names are prone to extremely short-sighted generalizations.

Oh, so you're just a *little* less dishonest then? /roll

I snipped it because it was irrelevant. I don't care if it's 1 or 100. I 
shouldn't have to erect substantial defenses to avoid it. Again, why 
should I just to appease you?

Of course it is. It's the primary reason I *do* use a fake address. Duh.

In your opinion. All it would take would be one idiot who decides to 
mount a crusade against me to make life miserable, then I'm left wishing 
I had simply used Hotmail, which, by the way, is hardly a fake email 
address. I check it almost daily. So what if you're not as comfortable 
with my using it. Deal with it. The nice thing is if some idiot takes an 
unhealthy interest in bugging me, I have options beyond reporting him to 
every host from which he harrasses me.
