What kind of PC is it? Packard Bell? Neverheardofit, Inc.? Home built
with a generic motherboard?  Hell, I don't know that I would even
trust Compaq or IBM PCs to run all of today's software.

What I'm really asking: Is it possible you may have gotten just what
you paid for?

Anyone who thinks that software this complex can be written to work
reliably on all PCs is seriously delusional.
