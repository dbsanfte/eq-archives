I would go gnome. Not having night sight is a serious pain in the butt.
I have a gnome necro and an erudite mage.
I like em both and since both have a (to me at least) perceived night sight
with summoned items or natural abilities.

That being said you could twink a erudite necro with the scythe and (s)he
would have infravision and see invis all the time anyway.

Just a side, I am having a blast with the necro, just got my duel wielding
pet (29th vs. 24th for mage). One thing as a necro you need to learn to do
is how to play a secondary healer while still DOT'ing everything when in a
group. But now that pets don't steal any xp. just have to remember to DOT
one time.....
