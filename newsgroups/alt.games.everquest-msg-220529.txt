Yup, I can see where that would be really useful.

Coldain ring would be a definite possibility but I'm  not very gung ho
on most of those quests. Tradeskills or mindless faction quests bore
me which leaves out most of them.

It's a matter of getting one me that flag and the choice is between a
65 shaman who's getting close to 100 AAs or a 48 Ranger. I'd rather do
it with my shaman since in the forseeable future he'll be a lot more
useful if friends want to hit that place again. If I do it, it will
probably be the shaman fighting through to the island, then running my
ranger up and having him summoned over.
