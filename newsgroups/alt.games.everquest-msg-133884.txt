Going via TD would be a lot safer than running through DL. If you can get a
port to skyfire you should be ok too. Nothing in skyfire runs even slightly
fast.

You can get bound just inside the northern part of the east wall in the
oupost, by the water. Nothing wanders down there. The bind spot in fm isnt
too bad either. I havnt seen anything wander really close to it. Its in the
south part of the zone, slightly to the west, next to a guy called finrin
tallister.
