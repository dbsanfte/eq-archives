This may be a developing trend then.  The same thing happened to me in
HHK the other day (MT server).  I know you're all just DYING to hear
the story, so here goes.  I was in a GR group, with a Ranger doing the
pulling.  Said Ranger started getting pissy about a druid "KSing" him.

On a side note, I sort of thought our Ranger was being a bit of a
whiner - the Druid was actually pulling singles and soloing them -
intruding on our camp (and as we know, Verant officially does not
recognize camps), but not actually KSing.

So anyway, Ranger actually petitions the Druid's behaviour, and
following the petition, the Druid starts to get really stupid.  He
starts to openly ooc and shout that he'll KS if he wants to, and
threatens to train us as well.  Well, stupid Druid ends up starting a
train and dies by it, with it getting no where near it.  I truly
laughed my ass off over that one. 

Upshot of this is following the petition, a GM had shown up invisd,
and watched all of stupid Druids subsequent behaviour, and told us to
send him a tell straightaway if stupid Druid returns and goes back to
his previous behaviour.
