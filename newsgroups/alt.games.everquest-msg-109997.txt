That's why DT and Lokari are *right*. You're supporting our position
right now. "Human notions". Not "Universal Absolutes". Which human
society? The one you happen to be in? The one in the caves of
Afghanistan? The one at the Salem witch trials?

There is no single human society - there are countless societies, all
ever-mingling, changing, and rearranging.

Again you demonstrate our point for us - the consensus of society
determines what qualifies as evil *for that society*. And the size of
that society varies from a single individual to entire nations.
