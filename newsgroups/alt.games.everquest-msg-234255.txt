Hello all. I received a 1 month free trial of EQ a few months ago and
I am thinking of trying it out. I still have a few files to download
from Sony's site and haven't had the chance to check out exactly what
I'm going to need. That's 29 15mb files and 1 6mb zip or 1 450mb file;
trying to figure out how that adds up. :/ Since this is a free trial
from Sony, I don't have the instruction booklet to refer to in case of
any questions and I'd like to get my questions cleared up before I run
into them. I want to jump into the game as soon as possible.

Anyway, here are a few questions:

1. Anyone know exactly how this works and what I should expect? A
rather 'cover-all' question, eh?

2. I am assuming this free trial means I am going to get 1 month free
but I still have to pay for a month anyway (in other words, I'm
basically getting 2 months for the price of one)?

2a. Will my credit card be billed even if I decide I don't like EQ
after my trial period is up?

3. If I decide to buy EQ, can I transfer my characters from the trial
version over to the actual game? This will be good to know because as
soon as I realize I like the game and if the characters do NOT
transfer over, I can buy the game and get to work on the characters
for the actual game and not waste time on the trial version
characters. I know that statement is a bit confusing, but it's the
best way I can word it. :/

4. Will I have access to everything on basic EQ?




I really don't see me not liking the game as I've played EQOA for the
PS2 for about a year now and I like it. While EQOA is a nice game and
they've tried to get more complex with it, I'm still looking for
something a bit more in-depth... Not to mention EQOA seems to have
been over run with grievers (people training other groups, camp
stealing, kill stealing, jerks and your basic 12 year old with a mouth
like a sailor that acts like he/she is stoned/drunk all the time and
thinks it's cool). To top it of, we have GMs that flat out suck and
usually favor the side of said griefer/s because they use loopholes in
SoE's policy (eg., SoE do not recognize camps, but anyone with any
credibility on EQOA respects another's 'camp') to their favor. I
realize I'll run into the same problem here, but it can't be as bad as
EQOA...

It took me about 2 weeks to actually start liking EQOA and I am
guessing the same applies to EQ. As soon as I realize if I like EQ or
not I'll buy EQ and all expansions (I understand there are a few?) but
since I have this trial period, I might as well use it. Thanks in
advance to anyone that can help me with my questions.
