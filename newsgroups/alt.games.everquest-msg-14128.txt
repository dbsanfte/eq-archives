Lol!  great!  Maybe he meant four hours!  I looked at where I need to go to
collect the spells at the website you recommended, and it should'nt take too
long at all : )

Perhaps he was one of the "do it all himself" kinda players, no help from
NG's or websites etc...if so..Good luck to him I say, wish I had the
patience to play like that myself (and the resistance to frustration he must
have)

Thanks again
