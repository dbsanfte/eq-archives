Lol, I just went back to Lfay since I've done my warden symbol, to see if
the tainted brownie was up, I got revenge on the bitch horse, it felt so
good... she gave me a bloody ass raping back at level 29 or so (HT = dead)

I completely forgot East Wastes, the Ulthorks drop armor that's druid
usable, and most pieces are fairly decent stats (I think the boots are the
bad ones, negative 3 wis, but still decent AC for druids, and up until
around level 25, AC is much more useful than wis, since you can still kind
of melee, and should to keep defense up)
