No, I'm not referring to people over in their heads. I'm talking about
people who kill steal mobs appropriate for someone half their level simply
because it's the single source of really easy money.

I'm not suggesting that all mobs drop equal loot, but I am suggesting  that
having a high concentration of one type of mob dropping 1 PP per level while
everything else of a similar level hands out peanuts is ridiculous. As I
said, it's nothing more than an ATM for high levels, while the people of a
level to get EXP hunting HGs can't get near one.
