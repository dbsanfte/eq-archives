I have a question, we have been discussing here in my little EQ community :

Is it faster to max out a skill/tradeskill by taking it in small steps? For
example, if money was no object, could I advance my skill just as fast by
starting out making an item that trivials at 200, as I could by first making
something that trivials at 30, then
another item that trivials at 50, then 70, then 100 etc.?

And regarding meelee skills in particular, if your level gets way beyond
your current skill, will it be harder to raise that skill?
Because, in a desperate attempt to max out my 2HB at level 40, I used a 2HB
staff
recently, once I got the mobs to snare scare.(My 2HB is every bit as bad as
my 1HS, which is around 10-20). I could NEVER hit them, and I didn't raise
my 2HB skill one single point.
So that's why I was wondering if it was "too late", so to speak...
