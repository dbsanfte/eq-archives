I'm starting to look into the Thurg and Skyshrine armor quests and I noticed
that a lot of the items are very similar and even seem to involve similar
types of quest drops.  Been working on both my CoV and Thurg faction (kindly
to Thurg, not sure yet on CoV) so both of these are started at least in that
direction.  I'm wondering if this is doable at my level.  Is this the
situation where my guild needs to be doing consistent Kael raids to have any
hope of accomplishing this?  Also which set would be better to go for?
Thanks for any advice or pointers any of you may offer.
