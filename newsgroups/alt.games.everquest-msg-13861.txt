Nah, everything I've ever read has said that the horribly large majority of
"hacking" done is because of a user with no sense of how to keep their PW
secure.

I occasionally have to delete users at work.  When I do, I have to first
type in the command that gives me their PW.  At least 1/3 of them use a
dictionary word or easy number repetitions...despite repeated reminders that
this is not allowed (unfortunately our mainframe software doesn't support
preventing this stuff).

EVERYONE that I know in EQ that has had their stuff stolen has given their
PW to SOMEONE.  This is ...hmmm... 6 people I think.  Another 8 people in my
guild have given my guild leader their account information.   When our
server split she had control of 6 accounts and since she was out of town
during the /movelog she asked me to do the command for her.

All 6 accounts had the same password.  Thankfully not a correctly spelled
dictionary word but that's still not good.

Of all "hacked" accounts so few are done by packet sniffers and the like
that it's laughable to toss blame on them.
