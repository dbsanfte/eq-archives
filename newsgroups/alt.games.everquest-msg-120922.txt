I like dragons more than spaceships as well, but this isnt just spaceships
this is Star Wars. people who did not see the first three movies in the
theatre (*Episode 1 & 2 are no where near the same as the old trilogy) are
free to choose which game they would like to play but if you went to see the
movies when they were new then I`m afraid that you must go for SWG or the
Hutts will track you down and freeze your  keyboard in carbonite.

Have a good day all
