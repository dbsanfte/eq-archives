That's right. Most of the shops close up at night and reopen in the 
morning. This is kind of neat, actually, except for the fact that one game 
world hour = like 24 real minutes, so if you just fail to make it to a shop 
before it closes, you've got hours before it reopens. Also, make sure 
you're out of it before it closes, or you'll be stuck inside all night.

I agree. They have a certain way that they envision the game world shaping 
up to be and part of that is an extreme lack of tolerance for malcontents. 
I think it's a freaking breath of fresh air, myself. Along with this they 
are currently exercising "Banfest 2005" - a period where they are dropping 
the bannificator on people for any sort of passive aggresive rule bending 
or otherwise obnoxious behavior. It's not a problem if one toes the company 
line, though - in other words, just be cool.
