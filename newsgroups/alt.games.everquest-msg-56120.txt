Thanks everyone for your answers.  Most of the stuff mentioned is either too
high level or too expensive for me right now but I did buy a foreman's tunic
for 150pp and chrysoberyl talisman for 200pp.  I probably paid too much for
both but I autioned WTB at the bank for the foeman's tunic and a guy there
responded.  Later, a guy auctioned to sell the talisman.  Neither required a
camp in EC, which made the prices much nicer in my mind.  Anyway, my wis is
now 147 and I'm broke.  I'm doing the bread quest in feeroot to get my
faction up with clurg.  That's decent money and after 15 trips, I've gotten
3 bubs of blue xp.  Still scowling with the guards though.

Someone asked what religion I am, so I worship Tunare.  A Tunarian Human
Druid from surefall.  I might not be able to see at night but at least I'm
not stupid or short.  heh
