Hmm that reminds me *g* Playing my little lowbie (level 6) bard, I 
grouped with a warrior once, who was, iirc, about level 7.  After she got 
poisoned, I decided to tank.  I'd been taking yellow pumas for days now 
solo, so why not?  So I pull us over a yellow puma, we start wailing on 
it - but we can't seem to kill it.  And meanwhile, I see my health bar 
taking a slow but steady nosedive.  Finally I fall unconscious.  But the 
cat stops being able to hit me *g* I see a guy run over to lend 
assistance - same level and class as me, so he took awhile to kill it, 
too :)  So here I am, having an out of body experience in West Commons, 
doing random /says as I watch them try and finish the stupid cat off 
before it can get another hit in and kill me.  I *didn't*, surprisingly 
enough, die, but I was unconscious for about a minute or so, and it was 
very amusing to be able to speak and make comments from a so-called 
unconscious body *g*
