Last night with no manaless damage, I soloed a Bloodraven.  I had nothing
but self buffs going, it took me about 15 minutes to root and rot him, I did
get about 3% xp for it though in level 58.

At 56/57 I soloed the bugs in FG, easy to get single pulls, all were blue to
me at 56, some lt blue at 57.  Watch for the big ones though, they are
unrootable.  The are located along the wall to the left just past the Shadel
bandits, you can get there invis in perfect safety, and if you stay on the
wall for the fight, you will get no adds.
