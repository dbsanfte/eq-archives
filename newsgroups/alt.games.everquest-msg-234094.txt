I don't know about pure casters but as a Ranger, I have managed to
free up 1 or 2 spell slots depending on the situation by investing in
innate camoflage and entrap.  I *always* keep snare up.  Now I can
keep it up without wasting a spell gem to do it.  Sometimes I also
need to keep camo up for self-invis.  In those cases, I have also
freed up a second slot.

For classes that can get these innate spell casting abilities, this
works a lot like adding a spell gem.
