Floor 6 also has the best fear pathing you can want.  Shadowbeast guards run
directly into the dead end, so you could fear kite without actually moving,
and with no chance of adds.  Obviously, when fear wore off, I always hoped I
had judged it right and that my paladin partner had made it more angry than
my wizard self had done, since there isn't much room to run away, but it's a
good place (as all dungeons are) for a caster to learn at the school of hard
knocks the perils of overnuking.
