I did Sherman's March to the Sea in the Warrens, building Heretics faction to ally so I
might walk uncontested through the streets of Paineel to obtain my Hole key.  That effort
translated into about 12 hours of nonstop Kobold killing.  Fortunately, there's not much
you can kill to earn neg Heretics faction, so I didn't have to worry about an albatross
around my neck when I started my quest.

But with regards to earning Chardok faction in a similar manner, I did a *lot* of XPing at
the LOIO Sarnak fort.  I could easily have -20k Brood of Di'Zok and Sarnak Collective
faction, because my time at the Sarnak fort was spent in early 2002, which I believe
predates the negative faction cap.  I've also gone back to the fort several times in
recent months, to visit the Chancellor and the Fabled Chancellor.  I think it would take
me a good, long while to raise my Sarnak faction from KOS to apprehensive or indifferent.

Still, I enjoy a challenge like this.  Is there a place in FM where I might find a tight
cluster of a hundred Goblins of Mountain Death, with a steady and speedy respawn rate?
