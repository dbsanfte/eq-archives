Due to the nature of the responses above, I feel a duty to elaborate.  My
goal here is not to demean or flame anyone.   I am not a troll.

Everquest, by its nature demands a great deal of time of the player.  The
game is absolutely no fun at all unless you really get into it, and getting
into it means playing several times per week, at least 4 hours per session.
A shorter session than this is often unproductive, as it takes time to
gather a group, travel to destination, recover corpse, what have you.  And
if you do not play the game often, you will find yourself behind on levels
compared to your friends and guildmates, so there is that pressure too.  I
realize there are exceptions to this, but predominantly, this is what is
happening.

At least with something like Tribes, you can sit down, play a round or two,
and then quit to do your other business.  Not EQ.

So, because the game is such a black hole, it tends to rob the player of
quite alot of free time.  And I do not care how well-adjusted you think you
are, if you are a serious EQer, other areas of your life will suffer - be it
social, professional, school-related, or family.  Even when you are not
playing it, I bet you are thinking about it, about how to equip your
character, what new class you may want to play, class balance, etc.  And how
can you focus on other tasks with this monkey on your back?

If you are a serious EQ player, and if you are honest with yourself, you
will know that what I am saying is true.  Since I have quit, I am much
better off in most aspects of my life.  Having dollars in the bank is much
more rewarding than plat.  You only have so much time in a day - focus it on
activities that will build a foundation for your future - not this drivel.

The bottom line is that if an activity is having an overall negative impact
on your life - drop it.  Really, the real world is like Everquest but
better.  There are no spells or monsters, but there are lots of emotes.

Anyway, if just a few people agree with me and toss their CD in the rubbish
can, I will feel like I have done a good deed.  Peace.
