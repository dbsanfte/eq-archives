}These are my 56 druid's current tradeskills.  I am interested in the
}easiest, cheapest way to drive these skills up...
}Thanks in advance to any masters who can help me...

Be aware that you can only exceed 200 on -one- of the six non-fishing 
skills listed until you have purchased levels of the AA Tanaan Crafting 
Mastery.  Fishing is capped at 200 anyway. :)

Definitely go to www.eqtraders.com.  Know it.  Love it.  Use it.

}Baking 191

If you can forage, get a bucketload of mushrooms (foraged in any luclin 
zone) and make ohabah truffles.  Once those trivial, make Misty Thicket 
Picnics. Another possibility is Halas 10lb meat pies, which requires 
farming rather than foraging.  If you're of planar level, save nearly any 
meat that drops in the PoP planes and look up what it makes (Hobgoblin 
Suprise, Hero Sandwiches, Mephit Sandwiches, Jord Meat Pie.)

If you're not choosing baking as your one skll to exceed 200, I'd probably 
leave it at 191 until I was ready to work on the Aid Grimel quest.

}Brewing 162

Faydwer Shaker will take you to 188, which is where I generally stop.  
Beyond that, Grobb Liquidised Meat, Minotaur Hero's Brew, and Demi-Sec 
Champagne are the reasonable choices.

}Pottery 136

Posion Vials.  There are a dozen kinds of skins you can use, Black Wolf 
skin, Zombie Skin, and Puma skin being the most common, and generally 
easily vendor-farmed.  Then Casserole dishes to 199, which is where I 
generally stop.

}Tailoring 20

The suggested woven mandrake is a simple route, but rather expensive.  you 
can save a fair chunk of change by hanging on to all the MQ and HQ 
bear/wolf/cat) pelts and spider silks you find while vendor mining skins 
for poison vials, and using the following recipes:

S/M/L tattered mask  (you'll need about half a stack of ruined pelts to 
                      get to the 26 trivial)
Raw Silk Mask (about a stack of silk swatches to 36, which sell well, so 
               you might skip this one)
S/M/L Studded Mask (gets you to 56 - If you have GoD, go do that free 
                    thing and skip to here!) 
-Then- do the woven mandrake to 66
and picnic baskets to 76 (they're better than using up valuable silk!)
Cured Silk Mask (waste a bit more silk to reach 82)
Greyhopper hide mask (if ya happen to find any greyhopper hides, to 88)
-or- Hand Made Backpack (to 88, and they sell well in bazaar)
Small Reinforced Mask (to 108 - you saved the Bear pelts for backpacks, 
                       right? And you'll need the HQ cat pelts for...)
Tailored Quiver (to 115)
Now you start on various Wu's and Crystalline Silk to 158, which is where 
I generally give up. :)

Note that for some of these recipes, there's an equivalent recipe with 
rockhopper hides and shade silk, so if you find those vendor diving, grab 
em!

}Blacksmithing 16

Make metal bits to 18
use some metal bits to make yourself a file, and maybe get a couple 
     skillups.
make a million more metal bits
use them to make studs to 35 -- you'll need the studs for the Studded Mask 
     under tailoring
make a stack or two of steel boning to 37, you'll need it for reinforced 
     masks
make 16 million more metal bits
skewers to 38
scalers to 41
dairy spoon to 72
filleting knife to 76 
lockpicks to 88 (even though it generally means running all the way to 
     fungus grove for molds)
If you have easy access to an enchanter, make worked silver chains to 111
embroidering needle to 122
Now you're ready to go read the thread where MJ and I argued about whether 
   Ornate was worthwhile or you should just move straight to fine plate, 
   and make up your own mind. :) http://tinyurl.com/25wy9

}Fishing 1

Go fish. :) Pick somewhere safe, bring lots of bait and a spare pole or 
two.  Iceclad, Cobalt Scar, Plane of Nightmare and Plane of Valor are good 
places to fish for something sellable, or possibly Sebilis.  Try to get a 
Fisherman's Companion, as others have said, but otherwise, make -sure- you 
bring a spare pole.  I frequently skill up fishing just in shadowhaven, so 
there's a spare-pole merchant 20 feet away. :)

}Fletching 1

http://mywebpages.comcast.net/aoenla/fletchguide/raising_skill.htm
says it better than anything I could write. :)  It hasn't been updated 
since time began, but most of it is still very accurate, with the 
exception of the very first sentence. :)
