Sorry to bug you all with this, but I've had no luck with an answer to this
problem in tech support chat or e-mail to company.

I have a few characters that are having this problem.  The hot buttons used
for the extra combat skills like slam, harm touch, kick etc.. will not
display  the name of the skill chosen for that spot.  They continue to
display "Combat Skill 1" or whatever it is the buttons say.  When I click on
the button and hold it down, it displays the correct skill name, but not
when just looking at it.  This is a problem for characters with more than
one extra combat ability because it is hard to remember which button does
what.  This is not just a problem I am having, my husband is having the same
problem on a different computer.  It is also not happening with all of my
characters.

Is anyone else having this problem?  Is it a known bug?  Any suggestions?
