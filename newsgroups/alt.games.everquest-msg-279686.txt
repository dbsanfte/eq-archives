This is the crux of the matter.  I've seen so many arguments that boil
down to "your playstyle is wrong because you don't play the way I do".
The great thing about EQ is you can play hardcore or casual and have a
good time.  I'm finding the same thing in WoW.  I know the feeling is
that WoW caters to the casual end, but there are certainly hardcore
folk there as well.
