All true, been iin here with a lvl 13 grouped with a lvl 15 wiz and
another char, the first and second spawn was about it, even the second
two spawn can go bad, if you hit one skeleton he jumps up goes to pick
up his buddy and both comes after you.

Somewhere further in there is a quest skeleton, he hits for 60's so no
fun for a lvl 15 :(

I guess with a good group this place can give nice xp and loot, solo i
think it will bring death to you :)
