Another problem with random's is that theres no point in attending raids
where nothing you want drops. Why would any casters bother coming to a vindi
raid.

Another thing I noticed when I was (briefly) in a "rolling guild" was that
pure casters had to roll against a lot of the melees for all/all items.
Basically melees get to roll on more items=more loot over time. Never mind
that the melee doesnt want the item himself... its all/all so he gets a
roll, an a chance to twink his alt. Nevermind that its an UPGRADE for me.
