The only instances of this you will run into would be people that might 
lead a bunch of monsters across your path to intentionally set them upon 
you, or wandering into a camp that will obviously not support both you 
and them and laying claim to some of the creatures that spawn there. This 
second example is more subjective, but since PvP in normal EQ is purely 
consentual, there aren't a lot of opportunities for people to pose much 
danger to you beyond these. It really isn't much of a problem compared to 
other games.

Heh, then this may not be the game for you. There is a bit of hassle 
associated with dieing in EQ (which I firmly support) in terms of xp loss 
and corpse recovery.

No level-based MMORPG worth it's salt has been able to come up with a way 
to do it without some sort of level treadmill. EQ has it too.

EQ probably has more instances of downtime that other games for the 
typical player.

There are particular classes more suited to soloing than others, though 
be advised that these are not consistent with those that are the most 
sought-after for the mass group-based higher end raiding content. They 
are more utilitarian in nature, allowing you to me a little more self-
sufficient. Just remember, what you can do solo will never compare to 
what you can do with a group.

This can be a problem in EQ unless your rate of advancement isn't *too* 
much slower. Through most of the game, you must be within your level * .5 
levels of everyone else in your group to get any xp. In instanced 
dungeons from the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion, all group members 
must be within 7 levels of each other.

Aside from certain anomalies in the game's collision detection system, 
this really isn't too large a problem. You can break line of sight (hide 
around a corner) and force a caster to advance on you to hit you and you 
can hit creatures with ranged attacks while they are forced to path 
through (mostly) logical routes to get to you. You *are* limited to how 
far above/below a target you must be in order to hit them with ranged 
attacks, though.

Much less hectic. The bulk of the skill involved is mental as opposed to 
reflexive.

Can't really comment on performance in Europe, but certain zones tend to 
me much more laggy than others, but there are ways to minimize that lag 
in combat situations, the primary one being to throttle back graphics 
effects and quality settings.

As a newbie? Not much. By the time you reach level 20 or so you probably 
want to invest in both PoP (for the Bazaar so you can better equip your 
character - save as much plat as you can prior to that point) and LDoN 
(for the instanced dungeons, if you're into that style of gameplay).
