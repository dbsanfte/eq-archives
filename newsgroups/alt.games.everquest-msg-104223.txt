I know, that's why I just said, "ok, thanks" to the Cleric.

But for exactly the same reason, most good Clerics send
an "about to rez, are you ready?" message to the "rezzee"
just before they fire the rez.  (With /ttell, it's easy
to have a permanent hotkey for this.)  My Paladin can rez,
and I *always* send an "are you ready" message, because I
got tired of blowing a lot of mana on people who just
happened to be in the middle of a quick inventory check
or whatever.

With that sort of prudent coordination, it would be "safe"
for the naked Cleric to take a moment to mem a rez and expend
some of his soon-to-be-poofed mana, with the only downside
being possibly having to say to his own rezzer, "not quite
ready, please wait fifteen seconds..."

Granted.
