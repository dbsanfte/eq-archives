All I get out of that is the after-the-fact rationalization.  And even that,
in part, supports what I said about pressure from the UN.  Try reading some
"stormin Norman" quotes from the original landing for a good counterpoint.

"Hindsight is 20/20."  Presidents and former presidents probably have a

Speeches on the way in versus after-the-fact books.  I'm happy with my

Hitler was going to stop after Poland.  Just ask Chamberlain.

It's not outside the realm of possibility.  But to keep it up with troops at
the doorstep?

Iraq had no friends.  Nobody liked Sadaam.  Iran would *love* to invade
Iraq.  Last time they tried, they got hit with "WMDs".  To admit that you no
longer have such a deterrent invites attack.  Kind of a rock and a hard
place situation by that theory.

Silly exaggerated insults are far too easy to turn against the person using
them as an "argument".  I'll let you pass this time, but you should be aware
of that.  =)

Anybody that becomes president is intelligent.  They may be pure evil, make
terrible decisions, or whatever, but they are undeniably intelligent.  The
stupid would have fallen long before they reached such a lofty plateau.

It was no answer.  I directly responded to your comment, and you respond
with a non-argument that shows you didn't have anything to go *with* your
comment.

Republicans have such a terrible record dealing with China, after all.  The
republican strong suit has always been their foreign policy.  The democrat's
argument against the republicans has always been that the republicans
concentrate far too much on foreign policy and ignore domestic policy.  To
an extent, the democrats are right about that.  It's a weird yo-yo effect on
this country as we switch back and forth between republican and democrat
presidents, with the republican presidents cleaning up foreign policy messes
as best they can and the democrat presidents cleaning up domestic policy
messes as best they can.

Rubin and Greenspan are republicans?  Neat.  I didn't know that.  I kind of
suspected Greenspan...

There's a bizarre mix.  Perhaps you meant you believe in some sort of higher
power.  "God" is a christian belief.
