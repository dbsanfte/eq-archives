You *can* get melee skill increases fighting light blue mobs.  I saw it
twice tonight with my Paladin's 2HBlunt.  It just happens to be excessively,
extremely rare...about to the point of being a waste of time if your primary
goal in fighting is to get your skills up.

Parry, and Rogue's Pickpocket skills can go up more frequently than straight
combt skills while dealing with light blue mobs.
