Hmm, I seem to recall hearing differently on that one Lance.  On any server
other than FV, the seal is nodrop, but you can MQ a shawl 3 for someone else
after you have recieved yours.  Personally, it is still sitting in my range
slot, as I still don't have something better to put there yet.  On FV, where
it may well be tradable, you could give it to someone for them to do shawl
3.  This is what I recall having heard in the past anyway, never actually
tested it.
