I'll have a try at dstep's program to disable the faultly key.

By the way I still think a program taking over the system should not 
crash "or exit that way" if an improper key is pressed.

If Verant want to take over the system take it over completely so that 
it can't take you in unsuitable situation. Beying disconnected while 
fighting, then logging again, dead because your LD avatar was still 
beaten until the server log it off.

I don't realy care if it's verant or microsoft responsability. I buy 
softwares, pay licences and expect the inproper features be threated as 
bugs and corrected. The tech support answer suggested Verant consider 
this out of their responsability.

Ill try to patch inactivation to the menukey with another piece of 
software. Can't risk the death while LD situation again.

Thank for the answers and help guys.
