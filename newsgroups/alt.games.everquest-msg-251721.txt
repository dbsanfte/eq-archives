Well sure, if you're stupid enough to try to emulate the graphics card.  But
then, that would be pretty damn stupid.  =) Coding an AGP interface and
porting a driver for an existing high end card would be a fraction of the
effort, and ten times the result (I've never played with a Cray, they may
already have an AGP driver).

I suspect that, if anyone were so inclined and had the resources, a Cray
would run EQ quite respectably.  Faster?  Maybe, maybe not.  But it could
also process the census results of China at the same time.   =)
