"Ok"? Who made a value judgement? I'm not telling you that it's ok,
I'm telling you about reality. It's not my fault if you're not
prepared to cope with it.

I have one, which is why *I* understand the above mentioned reality.

Ah, since you appear to have all this inside information about the way
Verant has their resources arranged, please elaborate. How many people
are on this "skeleton crew" you speak of? How many do you think there
should be?

See my answer to Robert. In case you have trouble traversing a thread,
I'll sum it up for you here: throwing more resources at a programming
problem is not always the right way to solve the problem.

Fans of some of the other games would disagree with this statement.
The *real* reason that Verant is still in business is that they offer
a decent service at a very reasonable price. It has nothing to do with
slapping your face.
