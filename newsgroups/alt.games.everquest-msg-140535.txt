Amazingly enough, they do mention that in the patch message.  But it doesn't
hurt to say it again here I suppose.  Well, they don't tell you about the
crash to desktop, just that you must revert to the default.  Of course, the
directions they give assume that you can get into the game to begin with in
order to revert to the default.  Go figure.
