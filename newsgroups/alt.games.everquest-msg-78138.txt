|help, suggestions, etc. Oh, and I really want to solo!

	Step 1: delete DE, reroll as an Iksar.

	It's not you.  Nektulos Forest just sucks.

	Step 2: enjoy the target-rich environment provided by the FOUR newbie
zones around Cabilis.  Level up to at least 12.  

	Step 3: stock up on plat, food and water, and maybe a nice bauble or two
to trade with locals; get a port to Tox or slip to the DL portal and take the
Luclin shortcut.

	Step 4: slip into Paineel, bind in front of the Warrens.  You're KOS to
start with but only Threatening, not Scowls; you have no penalty here due to
religion (Heretics worship Cazic) or class (Necromancers are favored).  Enter
the Warrens and kill a few hundred dogs.  Some will be green but most will be
worth EP.  You will probably have to destroy a lot of loot, but the dogs do
drop food and water to supplement your stockpile.  Save molars if you can;
once you're Apprehensive you can bribe a resident to let you in and out of the
city to turn them in for more faction.  (You can enter safely at Dubious but
you won't be able to shop or get quests.  You will be able to bank if you
like.)  At Amiable faction you can get your own key and then the world is your
oyster.  It takes approximately 225 kills to go from Threatening to Dubious
(non-KOS), and approximately another 400 to get to Apprehensive.  At that
point I turned in a bunch of molars and jumped to Amiable.  (Incidentally by
this point you should be non-KOS to Erudin guards, but the rest of the city
still hates your guts.)

	Step 5: by now you should be at least level 14.  You can continue to hunt
in the Warrens if you like, or you can go to nearby Kerra Isle.  Kerra Isle is
a welfare zone (high Zone Expereience Modifier) and yet almost always
deserted.  You can solo at least three spawn points near the entrance for
excellent experience.  Kerrans are on their own faction so you won't have any
problems with the Vah Shir on Luclin later.

	Step 6: when the kitties green out, move to Stonebrunt.  Wide open zone,
usually with less than a dozen people in it, ZEM is poor as is common for
outdoor zones but there are so many targets you'll easily make it up on
volume.  You can hunt animals, Kobolds or more kitties; I learned
feign-pulling by splitting the Kejeken Fishermen on the dock.

	I was out there until 24 and could have easily stayed until the mid-30s at
least, but an RL friend with a Ranger about my level had joined me by then,
and she was getting bored and wanted to move.  We're in CT now.
