(1) Rogues don't _need_ anything new...as a matter of fact, the first time
    I laid my hands on a 16/20 weapon, I thought "Well, that's it for any
new
    abilities for rogues some day..." :-)  The only thing I can think rogues
could
    use now is RP help, as in the locked chests and such for loot...or maybe
    a couple of new quests for something like the TCoDN to invis across zone
    lines or even the ability to train Sneak/Hide to do the same thing.

    And this is spoken as somebody with a 60 rogue and 55 rogue on the
    same server.

(2) I started a monk twink the other day when I ended up with a RFS dropped
    from a friend quitting for a while.  Hit her with a Fungi and some
Acrylia armor,
    some TBoots and a couple of Tink bags, and some other good training
    weapons.  She's now level 37 with about 19 hours played.  That Fungi is
    like self-powerleveling...and with Mend and some Shaman DS potions,
    I don't think she's ever really gotten below 1/4 health.  Monks in the
high
    end already can both solo a bit AND are highly effective in raids, both
as
    pullers and damage dealers.

Rogues and monks stack fine.  Any upgrades probably won't have much to
do with combat effectiveness...unless you want to see 'em upgrade Emp
to a billion hps and unresistable AoEs or something...
;-)
