I agree with you completely but am left with a question, or more of a 
problem I guess.  What do you do for items that don't stack?  I can see 
where it would be easy if I were making stackable items, but what if I 
was making toolboxes?  Don't stack so I would have a pile at my feet.  I 
know, the answer would be to just make that recipe not work like that 
but that would require coding the whole thing over again I would expect. 
  And I have never known Verant to go out of their way to make things 
easier.

Hope that made sense, insomnia is killing me tonight...
