For exp and your partnership then I'd say OT. Most of the mobs will still be
blue to you and the pull rate is pretty fast (loot is nothing to write home
about)
I'm using that to get out of 45 (hell) and my friends 35th Shaman is my
partner (making better headway there with 2 of us than I was in DL's in a
full group)
Don't pull the Rhinos or the Tigers. The Cats hit too hard and the Rhinos
have too much health to make them viable for a partneship.

If you want to make a group then Dreadlands (still not amazing loot but the
coin isn't to bad and many of the mobs drop gems) you can easily pull
together a group to hunt on the ridge. Good exp due to a really high pull
rate but you have to work pretty hard.

Loot wise I guess the Rygorr fort (expect party deaths there) or Crystal
Caverns (both Velious) but I don't think the exp is as good as either of my
Kunark suggestions. The rygorr fort has the potential but I always die at
least once and lose whatever exp I have gained (this is normally because
members leave and aren't replaced in time, the puller not realising that we
can no longer handle those elites with just 4 etc)

Dungeon wise, I stay clear of them for the most part, can take forever to
find a pick up group so unless it's organised already I never bother.
Sol B is meant to be excellent exp but is also pretty dangerous if you don't
know what you are doing. If things start to look bad in there and you don't
know the zone, try to find somewhere, you can easily locate again, to die.

From what I have seen money and equipment do not really come to those trying
to level fast. That is, I guess, until 46th when you can start going on
raids and entering the better (more dangerous) dungeons.
