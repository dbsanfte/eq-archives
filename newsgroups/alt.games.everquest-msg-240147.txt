ok, I see that went WAY over your head. no, neither of us "had to let a
pally or sk tank"


In my case, the ref to the two classes was a pre-emptive strike toward
people who love to say "You want agro? you shoulda made a pally"

In the other guy's case, there are situations where just because you are a
tank doesnt mean you are THE tank. (such as a raid) or even a single group
where another warrior has better gear/hp/ac than you. and your role is
backup tank/dps
