It wasn't the use of feminine pronouns that I questioned, so much as the 
  nature of the post. The mage was 'female' and the post was about the 
'mage', and the use of feminine pronouns was justified.

Nor was my comment on the lack of profanity. My use of the term 'asshat' 
could easily have been diluted to 'jerk' without significant loss of 
meaning.

It was merely the projection of 'playing a petty game' that I found 
interesting. Had it been a male toon, would he have used the same 
approach to the exposition. In other words did he characterize it as a 
petty game because the toon was female... or conversely would he have 
chracterized it as a petty game had the toon been male.

I'm sure most of us are almost convinced the player was male, but that 
really isn't the point. And I'm not suggesting that Richard treated him 
or her differently based on gender or perceived gender within the game, 
merely that Richard may have treated him differently than he otherwise 
might have (subconsciously or otherwise), in the form his prose took, 
here on usenet.
