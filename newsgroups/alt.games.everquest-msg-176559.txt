Rain clouds for two days, no rain. It would seem that God has heard my =
prayers concerning the rain. Might just be a fluke though right?

Here go to this site, has pictures of grey clouds with no rain falling =
and green lush hills in the background, yeah like that is normal for the =
middle of winter.

Hell don't go to it, I'm not making it for you but for the people still =
here most of you will still be here though so I guess i am making it for =
you but in 3.5 years so at least those few of you with any sense at all =
can see what has happened over this period which will give you a point =
of reference which may help.
