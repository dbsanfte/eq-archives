I guess profanity is like sex... People do it because it's enormously 
pleasurable*, but it offends the sensibilities of some. I agree with you 
that it may be wrong to use it especifically with the intention to offend, 
but I simply can see nothing wrong with it when used among consenting 
adults.

*I refer back to the "South Park:BL&U" thread branch.
