My EQ started acting funny even after I got the newest Nvidia and VIA
drivers.  I even had Direct X 8.1 installed.  Then I realized I had
downloaded 8.1 when it came out.  Went to the Microsoft website.  Sure
enough, there's been an update.  Direct X 8.1"B".  After downloading and
installing that, it runs perfectly.
