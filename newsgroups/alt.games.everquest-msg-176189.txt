They aren't talking about soloing with the pet.  They're talking about charm
soloing.

Some people manage to charm solo just fine.  But personally, I've avoided
that because every time I've tried it I've had my ass handed to me when
charm breaks.  And it always breaks at the worst time.

Dire Charm and Total Domination may change that, but I'm concentrating on
getting to 65 before I turn AA back on, so I really don't know.
