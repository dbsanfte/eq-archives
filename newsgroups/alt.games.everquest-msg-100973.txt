I guess it's just out of frustration, and now that corpse camping is
legal... But yeah, I don't see how someone can come to a PvP server
expecting not to get PKed. That's just silly. The atmosphere of the
server isn't for everyone, but I like it. It keeps me on my toes.

Ok, totally unrelated, but I'd like to share a story of one of the
reasons I play there.

A week or two ago a group of us were hunting at the entrance at the
hole after a small raid. We got word that the infamous "House
In'visus" was outside, and about to zone in. So, we buffed up, and
waited a minute.

They zoned in, and we fought for around 5 minutes, a full group vs a
full group. At that point, we hadn't taken any losses, and they had
taken one or two, and decided to evac. Well, we decided to evac too
(still not sure why; we were winning by a nice margin). We ended up
both evacing to BBM (this was a first for me, and had me laughing for
a while). We finished off another one or two of them, and the shaman
and druid and booked out of there with SoC.

This is the sort of thing I joined the server for, instead of the
naked gank wiz. But I take the good with the bad.
