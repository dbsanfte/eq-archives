If it follows the other eq server name conventions, then it is
[servername].everquest.com.  I can't try ping or tracert from here, but I
did see if the name would resolve, it did not.  My guess would be that they
used a different convention for it's DNS name.  You could probably find out
by asking in chat, they will generally give that out so you can tracert to
the server.
