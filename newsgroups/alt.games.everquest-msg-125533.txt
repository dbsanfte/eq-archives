I have read many of the post about the "perfect" duo combination for a pair
of players who want to group constantly.  My question is what type of duo
works best if your a single player and want to play two accounts?  I would
guess Healer/Melee would be best in that it would allow one player to handle
the duties of both characters without too much keyboard switching.  Your
thoughts?

The reason I ask is that I am contemplating a limited return to EQ.  In
order to remain a semi-decent husband and father, my gameplay would be
limited to an hour or so in the late weekday evenings.  I don't expect to be
able to play the high end game / raid with my rogue like I used too so I am
looking for less time intensive ways of relaxing in-game.  I just added a
hot, new gaming system in my home office so I have access to 2 systems in
order to do the self-duo thing.

Thanks in advance.
