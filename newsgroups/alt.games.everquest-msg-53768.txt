    Call me vindictive, but writing down their names and making sure the
next GM event was in their zone would do it. Imagine being in the middle of
a fight against a named in ToV when three drakes named Wynken, Blynken, and
Nod spawn and beat everyone to death while /shouting "Let's play follow the
leader with <Butthead's Name Here>!" It would be perfectly in character for
a GM event, and would be a hit to the faction that counts most for all
players - FellowPlayersOfNorrath. Would YOU take the moron on a raid,
knowing that Tweedledee and Tweedledum could spawn at any time and hand you
your ass?
