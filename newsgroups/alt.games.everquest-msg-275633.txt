I'm considering coming back to EverQuest after almost a year's absence--
I got busy with work and City of Heroes, among other things. As the 
subject says, what have I missed? Is there anything major pertaining to 
necromancers? (My main and highest-level character. I miss all the 
spooky evil stuff I used to do.)

sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Really, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
