I'm not much of a power gamer, but I do like gaining levels I guess.
Basically, there isn't loads to do besides level. Thats enough for me.  I
mean trade skills are a bit of a joke.  Its just non stop clicking really.
Quests are just a matter of run to point a, get or kill something, run to
point b. ect...  Hmm, what else..  I guess you could explore, but unless
you're a high enough level, you'd be heavily limited in where you could go.
It would be cool to do some sort of an adventure type thing, but the game
just isnt set up for that if you ask me.
