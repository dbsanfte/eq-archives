If you are in the game, and try to zone into a zone you don't have the files
for, you bounce back to, if I recall correctly, the safe spot in the zone
you are in.

If you try to log into a zone you don't have files for, I believe you bounce
back to the character select or login screen.

The bug works the other way to (or there is a related bug that does).  There
are people that have expansion and they show up as not enabled.
