Anecdotal evidence, if that was in fact what it is, as weak as it would 
be, would still trump any statistical evidence that came out of Xocyll's 
ass.

I provided clear proof for the existence of the usage of the word kill 
stealing according to my definition.

Now lets review 'my proof':

In layman's terms I stated 'there exists people who play CoH, and define 
killstealing thusly within CoH', and then I presented an article written 
by people who play CoH, in which they in no uncertain terms proceeded to 
go ahead and state that they define killstealing thusly within CoH.

A clearer proof of the existence of a particular word usage you will 
never find than when the authors define it themselves.

Dismissing the argument as anecdotal is a silly error which results from 
a poor understanding of proof theory, or perhaps just a desire to be 
obtuse. Its true that you cannot in general prove things are true by 
example; however, if all you are doing is proving something *exists* 
examples are more than adequate.

I'm not asserting that -everyone- defines killstealing thusly. I have 
gone as far as making the conjecture that more people define it thusly 
than by using Xocyll's definition. And I concede the evidence for -that- 
is anecdotal. But until an independant party establishes a mutually 
agreeable method for counting the number of people who do and do not use 
it then anecdotal evidence is all we have.

However, the articles are strewn about the net for all to see. You don't 
have to take my word for it. Have a look for yourself. Do your own 
informal count. Or better still do it rigorously and scientifically, and 
post your hypoethesis, method, data, and results so we can then work 
from that.

I think you are grasping at staws on this one.

If this is the point you want to push. I'm willing to limit my assertion 
to 'based on the only representation of the playerbase from which we 
have to work with it holds that the phrase kill stealing is used in 
accordance with my suggested word usages.'

But then I would feel compelled to remind you that there is a 
mathematically sound statistical basis for assigning significant 
probability to the statement that the word usage displayed in the forum 
subgroup applies to the playerbase as a whole.

That is, after all, how the field of statistics works, indeed, rather 
the point of it. Granted this isn't the best polling group because we've 
allowed them to self select, but I'm skeptical that you'll come up with 
any legitimate justification to doubt the usage is somehow limited to 
this group.

Otherwise, do you have a -better- representation of the playerbase from 
which to derive an alternative defintion. I'm open to suggestions.

Why not? 

Why shouldn't CS acknowledge that there are player activities that are 
allowed by the mechanics that are a problem. Why shouldn't they monitor 
them, keep their finger on the pulse, and escalate it to a priority to 
fix if complaints hit a critical mass.

You'll never know when it goes from a minor annoyance to a plague if you 
don't log or report incidents.
