Making a mistake does not translate into incompetence.

I work for a software company that produces publication software for the
newspaper industry. Among our customers we count prominent American and
European newspaper houses like The New York Times, The Washington Post,
Chicago Tribune, Springer Verlag, etc., etc.

When, of course on rare occasions, we make mistakes, these guys get in
serious deadline trouble, facing million dollar losses. Yet, they seem to be
more composed and confident that we do our best during such times than the
average EQII player.

Having said that, it /does/ piss me off that the freaking servers are down!
