Druids don't NEED groups.  Frankly, there have been very few exp
groups I've found that can net met more exp than I can get doing some
quadding with my druid.

And yes, there are many groups out there that don't want druids
because they aren't the best at anything.  BFD.  If I can't find a
group, I can always go solo.  Most tank classes can't do that.  Rogues
can't.  Hell, if a cleric can't find a group (it actually DOES happen
on occasion) they're totally hosed.  

Druids ARE easy to level up because even if they can't find a group,
they can always go grind out a very reasonable amount of exp WITHOUT a
group.  And they only make a group stronger for they're versatility.
Druids are cake to level.

Here is the problem.  All three 'healing' classes AREN'T healers.
Shaman are buffers/debuffers and Druids are a support class.  Shaman's
jobs are to make the party stronger and the mob weaker, and a Druids
job is to provide support, IE, a heal when necessary, some good
offense, a little crowd control, good buffs.  They aren't necessary to
a well balanced group, but they make a well balanced group work
BETTER.

Can you blame them?  They do ONE thing in a group better than anybody.
They heal.  That's it.  That's all they are wanted for.  You take that
away from them and then who needs a fucking cleric?  Sure, for rezzes
maybe, but you don't need them in the group for that.  Give CHeal to
Shaman and Druids and you reduce Clerics to Rez whores like Druids are
Port whores now, EXCEPT clerics can't solo like a Druid or even
Shaman.

And one wonders why clerics are touchy about losing superiority in
that arena.

What an incredibly stupid, narrow thing to think.  I've met more
druids that suck ass than clerics.  As a matter of fact, most people
that I know that play clerics tend to be pretty good players AND
pretty good people.

No, but it will take away from the ability for clerics to get groups,
which then NEED, unlike druids.

I won't necessarily argue the fact that Paladins shouldn't heal better
than druids, but the thing is that they don't actually get to heal
better than druid till well into their 50's.  Until then they are a
step or so behind druids in that ability.  And once again, Pally's
don't get SoW or Ports on top of that, and while they can solo, they
don't do it nearly as well as druids.

Necro healing is a joke, and I know some pretty damned good necro's.
Monks solo well, but not as well as druids AND they don't have the
utility.  Bards would be in EXACTLY the same boat as druids were it
not for Mana song I think.

52 druid.  Played him for 3 years and still play him and I don't plan
on quitting him.  More importantly, while I love having clerics around
and think they are a great class, I think I'd rather jam alcohol
soaked glass shards into my eyes than play one.  Just not my speed.
