  Bad manners?  Yes.  However, if you consent to a guildwar over a killsteal
scenario, do you really expect the other guild to treat you with manners?

  I personally have no problem with in game marriages, but don't see the
point of them if it isn't based on roleplay.  And roleplaying, in a dynamic
and dangerous world like EQ, means that sometimes having to deal with
conflicts such as these.
