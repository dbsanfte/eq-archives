And, if you are willing to leave your character online in the bazaar while
you sleep, you should never take less than 5pp per spider silk.  It'll sell,
but you just have to wait out the undersellers.  One way to get around that,
if you happen to have some cash, is to buy out the lowballers, and resell a
5.
