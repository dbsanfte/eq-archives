I'm selling the account to help pay for a GeForce3 card for a new computer I
just built. I haven't really had the time lately to spend playing EQ so I've
just been playing first-person-shooter games as it's easier to log on, play
for a few minutes, then log-off. My current graphics card (TNT2) is severely
out-of-place in my new system and serves as a huge bottleneck. So unless we
could work some trade involving the video card then I'm just looking for
cash. Sorry man =(
