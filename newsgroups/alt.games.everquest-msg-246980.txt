The biggest flaw in this expansion was undoubtedly the amount of ULTRA CRAP AA skills. I would rather hit level 2 on a toon than
grab a GoD AA skill!!!! And yes.. its that bad! I liked GoD just because its a place where you can hunt without n00bs hassling the
zones with n00bness (like BoT). Apart from that, GoD sucked. Also the ultra crap design with leadership aa's. I mean, even my dog
could make better designs than the current designer team up at SOE. No offense, but you guys really are starting to suck. DX9 is a
nice upgrade, despite the bugs when it was implemented.

It has always been my vision of EQ that characters are at their most powerful at midlevels. They should of kept the cap at level 50.
Those where the days. These days level 65 mobs are just too tough compared to a level 65 pc.. to an extent where its not fun... its
a joke.

Another long term 'issue' with EQ is the group cap of 6 and raid cap of 72 players. These should be removed entirely as not even the
designers in SOE can agree on this... and its frikkin annoying with the different bullshit caps you've made in the game atm. Let the
players decide how big their group and raid should be. Some people are bad players, hence they would need more players to overcome a
certain foe, or maybe a group of 8 friends would like to hunt together, but with the caps and penalties they cannot do so
effectively...
