Heh. I always answer my phone, "Jekke speaking," now. It was a
tradeoff between trying to remember whether it was a personal cell
phone, business cell phone, personal land line, business land line, or
someone else's office phone I was answering and trying to remember
what company I was working for at any given moment. (I changed
contracts every nine months or so and was forever answering with the
wrong company name.)
