The irony is, if they did any decent testing then they wouldn't have to 
patch every second day.

I am interested, do the other MMORPG games have this much downtime or 
are SOE unique in their incompetence?

After all the recent nerfing, PoP Europe vs US distribution nonsense, 
continual downtime, cheap tactics by SOE to force raiding players to buy 
PoP and immense disappointment in the class balancing issues introduced 
with PoP its no wonder so many people are leaving the game (no I don't 
have any formal statistics, but I personally know five people who have 
left, and that's out of personally knowing 7 who play EQ).

What I would like to know is, are any other MMORPGs, like DAoC, any better?

I just get the impression SOE are doing all they can to shove PoP down 
our throats as a last big cash in on EQ before they release SWG, at 
which time they will lose interest in EQ and let it slowly die.
