Just as a side note to this discussion. My wife has a 47 Cleric and was looking for
a reasonable upgrade to the 2HB she has been wielding for the last 15 levels, (she
likes to get in and swing, when she is not swinging a 2HB she has a CGS and
Jouneyman's Stick).

We were in Thurg and some guy started advertizing one of these Drakkel Icegrinders.
As it was an upgrade to what she had and this discussion was fresh in my mind, I
told her to go for it. She asked the guy what he was selling it for...

3000p (On Tunare).

So what the hell are these things worth, :-)
