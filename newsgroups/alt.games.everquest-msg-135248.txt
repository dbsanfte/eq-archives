Ah yes that compassion was much in evidence in the Balkans was it not?  So
we can count on you guys to rush your troops and food into the trouble spots
from now on?

That's why I said *moving towards*, prick.

Well  I am a prick because we do not agree, or because I am an American? Gee
and I thought just Americans were arrogant. Chuckle. There is hope for you
yet Brit. You may just pick up that attitude again that once made you great.
That is if you will quit being so compassionate with the undeserving.

It is foolhardy. You are dealing with people who understand force only. Read
the words of your own Prime Minster about them.

I am not talking about prisoners I am talking about terroists that are still
out there. I suggest you read "Al Queda  Global Network of Terror."  And I
am so glad the rest of the world is so enlightened though; but, pardon me I
am a bit confiused, how do you manage to speak for all the world? Kind of an
ego trip for you eh? And there are some places I would like you tell me
about that sure do not appear very enlightened to me.
