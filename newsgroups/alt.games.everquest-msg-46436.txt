Shooting victim fights to rebuild his body, his life


By Farah Stockman, Globe Staff, 8/12/2001

The eight bullets that riddled Eugene Yazgur's body met their marks with an
assassin's precision: One entered the 28-year-old's nose, breaking his teeth
and shredding his tongue. Another pierced his liver. Another ripped into his
arm. Still another snarled just shy of his spine. Two more snapped the femurs
on each leg.

In the predawn shadows, the masked shooter fled the Jamaica Plain apartment,
leaving Yazgur's roommate - a young poet - lying lifeless in his bed and
Yazgur's dog dying on the floor. The only sound was the voice of a 911 operator
echoing through a cellphone into Yazgur's ear.

''I can't hear you. I can't hear you,'' the voice said, until the cellphone
went dead.

At the hospital, doctors told Ellen Yazgur that her son had been shot so
thoroughly, so skillfully, that he had less than a 1 percent chance of
survival.

But in defiance of those predictions, as if out of spite for the attacker
himself, Yazgur survived.

Now, as he prepares to testify in October against the medical student and
former Israeli Army sniper charged with the March 2 shootings, Yazgur is
rebuilding himself, bone by bone, hoping that his body's victory will translate
into another kind of triumph.

''I want to laugh in his face,'' Yazgur said of the day he will face Daniel
Mason in court. ''I just don't want to walk in there with a cast on, or roll in
in a wheelchair. I want to be standing.''

It won't be the first time he confronts Mason in court. But by now he knows
better than to expect an answer to the question of how an unremarkable traffic
dispute, the kind that happen every day, allegedly escalated over several years
into a bloodbath.


Dangerous encounter


It was Moving Day, Sept. 1, 1997, and like most streets in the college
neighborhood of Cleveland Circle, Orkney Road was clogged with moving trucks,
U-Haul vans, and Hondas with futons strapped to the roof.

Yazgur, a 5-foot-6 mountain climber who had emigrated from the Soviet Union as
a teen, was working as a mover. He double-parked his truck, and behind him, an
impatient Boston University medical student named Daniel Mason, who was also
moving, yelled out of his car that he couldn't pass.

Yazgur shouted back that he would move the truck in five minutes. But Mason, of
roughly the same height and build, got out of his car and yelled that he would
move it himself. After a quick scuffle, Mason grabbed Yazgur by the throat,
pulled out a packing knife and nearly severed his earlobe, according to police.

Mason had been arrested previously for threatening to kill a girlfriend and
beating a man in a dispute over gym equipment, and would later spend time in
jail for pressing his thumbs into the eyes of a stranger who wouldn't stop
jingling his keys while waiting in a line. For the attack on Yazgur, Mason was
convicted in 1998 of assault and battery and given a suspended sentence.

In June of 2000, a judge in a civil case ruled that Mason owed Yazgur $118,000
for the injuries. After the judge announced his ruling, Mason, who had
represented himself in court, closed his briefcase, looked over to Yazgur, and
snarled, ''You'll never see a penny,'' said Jefferson Boone, Yazgur's attorney
in the civil case.

''I expected that once he was faced with this humongous judgment that he would
do something, that he would appeal,'' said Boone.

But he didn't.

On March 1, Mason was served with an order to start paying. Before dawn the
next morning, a masked killer crept into Yazgur's apartment and methodically
shot, with exploding schrapnel bullets, every living creature he found there.

Michael Lenz, a 25-year-old graduate student at the University of Massachusetts
at Boston, died instantly from a bullet to the temple.

Yazgur, who was first shot through a closed bedroom door, eventually caught
sight of the masked shooter and clung on to consciousness long enough to call
911 and be carried to the hospital. He finally closed his eyes - some emergency
room staff thought for good - at Boston Medical Center, the same hospital where
Mason, a scrub-clad medical student, was led away in handcuffs three days
later.

Police began investigating Mason after Boone notified them of the long
simmering battle and the fact that he had just had the payment order served on
Mason.

Although Mason, now 36, had told friends he was haunted by his experiences as a
sniper in the Israeli military and had turned to medicine so he could ''save
lives rather than take them,'' prosecutors contend that his experiences in both
lines of work made him a perfect assassin, knowing exactly where to shoot to
cause the most pain.

Yazgur spent the first month in a coma that doctors induced so he would not
feel their knives removing leg muscles he'd jogged hundreds of miles to build.

Full consciousness found him in a bed at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital,
where his arms, once powerful enough to hoist himself up mountains, could
barely part the curtains of his window. The window revealed a view of the
Nashua Street Jail, where Mason sat awaiting his trial.

''You know he's in there,'' Yazgur said from his hospital bed, gesturing to a
visitor. His legs were strapped into ski-boot style braces. ''What if he's
looking out at me?''

Some of Yazgur's doctors worried about his mind. One trauma specialist said,
''He can learn to walk again, but will he learn to walk down the street again
and feel safe?'' - but Yazgur focused on his body.

And he continued to fight for full recovery. The medical system that
miraculously saved his life turned into a Kafkaesque struggle with insurers.

Yazgur fought Blue Cross Blue Shield, which he said planned to release him
early. He fought doctors who encouraged him to wait on certain procedures
because of backlogs and other reasons. He fought with the therapist who refused
to work with his barely moveable right hand, Yazgur insisting it could be
repaired.

Miraculous recovery


Nearly six months after the shooting, Yazgur walks on legs hugged by braces.
Nearly every day, he makes the several-block trek from the Fenway neighborhood
where he lives with his grandparents to his daily medical appointments. He
winces, flashing teeth that are still under construction, when he passes a
motorcycle that reminds him of the one he used to ride when he was living in
Alaska. His liver, as obstinate as the rest of him, has regenerated itself. His
hands - which have been his lifeline in all his jobs, from hauling nets of
salmon to moving heavy furniture to, just before the shooting, writing computer
programs - are now learning like an infant's how to do simple things.

''It's a total miracle,'' his mother, Ellen, said.

Despite the breathtaking achievements of a dozen different surgeons and
physicians, his body is still a work in progress, and Yazgur is far from
satisfied.

''I still have a couple dates with Mr. Scalpel,'' he joked, balancing carefully
on the stool of a local bar.

Even with leg braces, a cast, and the loss of 40 pounds, Yazgur still looks fit
as he stretches his shirt tightly over his stomach and runs a visitor's hand
over the hard plate of tissue that has formed there in the wake of many
surgeries. He wants that plate removed because now it hurts to bend, and one
day it could impede his rock-climbing.

''If they won't remove it, I'll find someone who will,'' he vowed, lisping
through the space between missing teeth. But beneath the slowly repairing
surface, there are clues that the mental recovery will take even longer. He
confesses to being consumed with anger when a passerby on a crowded street
bumps him. An innocent query about his cast makes him want to scream. The sight
of dog hair on his mother's pillow chokes him with grief, and the only request
he has made of detectives is that they return the leash of his dog, Sampson.

''I told him, `You know you are not the only victim. You also lost your
roommate,''' Yazgur's mother said. ''But I'm not sure it helps to say that.''

Meanwhile, the man Yazgur calls an assassin maintains from behind bars that he
is innocent. His lawyer, Robert Jubinville, said Thursday that so far ''nobody
can make an identification'' of the killer.

The prospect of a trial that could result in Mason's release haunts Yazgur, but
he says as long as his body is rebuilt, he can face it.
