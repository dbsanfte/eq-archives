OF COURSE it was an error.

It's just that I get a bit steamed up when the response to making
such a mistake, and killing a bunch of innocent people on their
wedding day is to act like Bart Simpson and say "I didn't
do it, it wasn't my fault".

The *first* line should be an apology to the victims - not an
attempt to say it was all their own fault, and the people
in the planes are blameless.

I'm sorry, but I do find the attempt to shift the blame onto the
victims here despicable and pathetic.

And, talk about putting words in other people's mouths!
