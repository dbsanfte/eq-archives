Agreed Ghost.  You do the math.  My main is pretty much all I ever
play.  Started Sept 2000 and as a 47 Warrior has over 183 days of
played time.  =)

OK, for those who are lazy that is roughly 4400 hours I have put in on
him alone in the last 22 months.  So that is roughly 200 hours played
per month and with an average of 30 days in a month it works out to
almost 6 hours and 45 minutes every day since Sept 2000.

And that is cut down.  At one point I was at over 8 1/2 hours a day as
an average at about the 1 year anniversary of my playing EQ. :-)

Nah, I dont have a problem LOL
