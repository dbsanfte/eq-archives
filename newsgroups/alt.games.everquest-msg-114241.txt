Definition of Merit based loot distribution: Enchanter busts his chops for 4
hours keeping ads mezzed, everyone claritied and hasted.
Enchanter burns 2 stacks of Peridots on rune IV on himself and cleric.
Enchanter is given an even split of the money gotten and nothing else since
'nothing enchanter specific' dropped. (even though two war only items were
given to a warrior who will just sell the damn things cause he has better).
Cleric gets all the gems and jewelry for 'symbol expenditures'.
Enchanter bitches just a bit, then switches to low level Alt, who gets to
hear enchanter get bitched out in guild chat 'for being greedy'.
