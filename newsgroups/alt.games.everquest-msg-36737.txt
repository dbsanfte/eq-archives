Gratz!!! 

Well, in all reality you have "won." You are 60 and you have your
epic. Doubtless, if like other clerics on the tribunal server you 
also probably have a set of purple plate from hate rotting in the
bank and also a set of POG armor you wear and perhaps several
pieces of either skyshrine or Kael Tov armor. You probably already
also have a fantastic set of resist, mana, wis, etc items in addition.

As a 55 druid still not with a set of planes armor at all, since it
hardly drops basically and my guild just got to TOV but now I finally
have a 40 hour a week job and a life so I have next to no chance to
get some anyway, I honestly don't know why you are still playing ;)
I do because I'm pretty far from really any goal of that character,
still 2 (of the easier though really.. one being timorous dragon)
steps from epic, only level 55, no major planes or TOV armor (no thurg
except boots.. and gloves but then got coldain gloves and boots..
ahaha) In fact the biggest luck thing I got out of left field recently
was a lodizal shield, yeah and being a druid I actually USE it as as
shield ; )

I honestly don't know since from what I've said you can see that I am
so amazingly far removed from where you are. Would I still play if I
was 60, had my epic, and had all skyshrine druid quest armor? I
honestly don't know. I'd have nearly ran out of reasons to continue to
play then since it would be every goal I have. Like you I'd probably
still have PoM, Sleepers and VP to see but really are those things
alone worth staying? I think tanks end up with more reasons since
there is always some more uber weapon but as say a druid with your 
epic, all skyshrine quest armor  and great resses and wis from that
then probably with additional res gear like velium diamond rings, bd
tiara etc, you'd end up at something like 200 wis, a bunch of mana and
like 120 base ALL THE TIME on every res. I'd have trouble thinking up
more goals ;)

Rather than playing yet another newb char twink in EQ though ( a game
by which time I'd know even more inside and out than I do now) I'd
probably be getting into DAOC or something about then, maybe you will
also. Its really all about having fun, if you are still having fun at
60 with your epic and still want to log on that character and do
stuff, then its still worth it.
