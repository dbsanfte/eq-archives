Well, as I understand it, the crushed dread diamond can be gotten as a
ground spawn in TD instead of the convoluted quest involving the pestle and
using alchemy.  I found a website that stated where it spawns, and actually,

alchemy is almost maxxed for my level, I sell sow potions to pay for
practicing it up.
