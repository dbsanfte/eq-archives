    Monual answers!

    Every tradeskill is like that. That's one of the real joys of something
like the Ethereal items shortcut - it's a time savings as well as a cash
savings. I went from 194 to 212 in Tailoring last night in three hours,
spending no more than 5 K. Ask people who did Solstice robes how much time
it took them from when they started gathering items until they finished all
combines to go through those skill levels. (I still have to do Solstice
robes to 220 - /shudder)

    You didn't have The Unspoken Word memmed? 1 second cast time, it takes a
real beating to be interrupted on that.

    Leather padding costs in The Bazaar are outrageous. No matter what the
combined item is you're after, try buying the components and doing the
combine yourself. It's almost always cheaper.

    And you call yourself a smith?!? There's two forges in The Bazaar. One
is back towards the tunnel to the arena area, on the SH zone side of The
Bazaar. The other is in the stables area. The stables one has low lag, too.

    The dyed versions have some pretty unique looks. But then you need to
stock dye, and it becomes a big hassle.

    Owie. I'm surprised they didn't hassle you to come along and raid,
though.

    I am soooooo glad I can imbue emeralds. Only dwarf I know of that can.

    That sounds like my first attempt at an imbued dwarven plate cloak, oh
so long ago. It was wonderful when I came back later and made a near-full
set of Enchanted Dwarven Plate for my warrior (I got a +15% Smithing item in
the interim).

    Heh. 192x1.15=220.8>220. Skill 192 suffices. (Skill 191 does not,
leading me to believe the server truncates all modified skill scores rather
than rounding them.)

    I took the easy way out and coerced a guild brewer with 250 skill to do
it in return for me stocking the guild with ethereal silk swatches and cured
ethereal energy. The worst part was making all those celestial essences.
Folks, if you ever feel like making quick cash, make a huge pile of
celestial essences then put them up for sale in The Bazaar at 6 pp each
(double component cost). You will sell out. Trust me.

    Mino Brew is the devil. I'd raise my brewing above the 189 it's at now,
but that would mean making more of those demon drinks and I refuse.

    Your skill-up rate does not seem to depend on success rate. There is
still active debate on the topic, however.

> Still, my current adjusted skill of 243 seemed pretty high.

    Whatever success percentage someone at 250 has, you have seven absolute
percent less. So if a given combine works 60% of the time at 250, for you
it's a 53% chance of success. Unless dealing with something with a low
chance of success, you are officially "good enough".

> Very slowly I opened them...and my cursor was holding a belt.

    I forget if my first "wow, I made THAT?!?" tailoring combine was a 10
WIS cloak or an 8 WIS belt, but it's one of those times where you feel like
it was all worthwhile. Right now I'm looking forward to making my first Ice
Silk Cap for my Bazaar mule ENC - because I can.

    Heraldic is big money. Big, BIG money. I've been trying to convince the
person that has an alt human monk with the Hammer and 200 Smithing to spend
the three AA's on New Tanaan and become a Heraldic smith because of how
useful it would be to the guild.

    Isn't it amazing to call 60000 pp and a Fungi Tunic "a bargain" for
something you made? =) And now that blue diamond prices have crashed, the
cost to create is quite reasonable.

    The sickles sell very well, too. You'd be surprised how many people are
doing the Solstice quest still. I'd estimate between 24 and 48 Solstice
robes sell in The Bazaar per day, based on what I've seen selling the ones I
made. When I had the lowest price of the traders there, I could not keep
them in stock longer than one day.

    Pottery got a skill-up nerf, but it's still pretty easy. It's very
straightforward to get to 199 skill.

    Congrats again on ending up in the money. It's an odd place to be for a
cleric!
