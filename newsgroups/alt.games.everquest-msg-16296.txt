As much as I love mages (I am one, btw) his unique niches would not fit
here.  Manaless roots/stuns/damage spells and shields would not have the
benefit as a good melee'er during a fear.  Summoning is not needed for
waterstones (duh), bandaids (no damage dealt really), mod rods (not planar),
throwing daggers/arrows (unless Bard gets bored), or P.C. Summoning with CoH
(no aggro during fear).
