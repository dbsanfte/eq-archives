My first kindness from another: at level 3, someone in GFay shouted
he'd give away patchwork armor for batwings. I made a deal with him,
set out for those pesky bats, and by the time I dinged 5, I was fully
dressed.
My first group: level 6 or 7, either orc hill or GFay bandits. A day
or two later, I got a tell from a stranger. I was deeply impressed
when /who showed it to be a 27! monk who was badass enough to be
exping in CT! It was the main character of a little gnome enchanter
I'd been grouped with. We teamed up whenever we could when I got
higher in level, both before and after I restarted, and although he
quit with the Luclin release, we still maintain contact. Another
person from that first group is still on my friendslist, although as
her druid instead of her old retired wizard.
My first magic weapon: around level 14, I started hankering for
something magic so I could hit wisps. The hankering became an urge
after a ghoul found me while I was handing in derv rings. I mentioned
I was saving up for a runed totem staff in a group, and when one of
the others had to leave, he first took me to the bank and pulled a RTS
out of his bags for me :)
My first ubermob: Level 34, Avatar of Fear. Myself, monk friend, a
couple rogues, enchanter, cleric. A couple minor overpulls and adds
and AoF popping and heading for the druid first while two people were
out of the zone, leading to one of my first evacs (which was a
complete success). We headed back in, collected the missing two
people, and butchered the ugly thing. Twice. Getting the killshot was
one hell of a feeling :)
My first (and only) GM reward: last halloween, I was in Freeport
working on smithing when someone shouted for people to hear his sad
tale. Someone with two names. /track, /hail Deacon Gallius. He wanted
people to come with him to OoT and put some undead shipmates of his
out of their misery if he couldn't use the power of Erollisi to save
them. People were gathered, we took the boat to OoT, took another
ghost ship to one of the islands, predictably had to kill the sailors.
After the event, a rogue who'd shown up shortly after I did got an
earring, and I got a hierophant's cloak, which I am still wearing (I
managed to keep roleplaying with the GM in says, but my friends had to
wait a while before they got more than sdfdtrs!!!!#%!!!! out of me) :)
