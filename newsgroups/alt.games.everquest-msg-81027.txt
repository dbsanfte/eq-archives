I've been there.  I lost two yellow bubbles and most of a third - I
noticed them missing when I went through a zone.  I'm not absolutely
positive but I think it defaulted to the amount of xp I had at the
time I signed on that day.  I had been in one zone the entire time I
had gained the xp.  

Frustrating, to say the very least.
