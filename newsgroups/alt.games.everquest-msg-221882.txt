I play on the Mac server. Been lurking here in a.g.e. for a few months
picking up tips etc. We're currently playing with a server that is
equivalent to PC just after the release of PoP. Best place to get
specific Mac info is www.eqmac.com. Fan site put together which beats
the Sony forums for information (At least for our server). We're
slowly making leaps and bounds. I'm with the top end guild on server
but we have a second guild right on our heels. Kelorek'Dar is the
biggest beastie that has dropped on the server besides Lodizal.
Highest end characters are some Beastlords and wizards at 58.
