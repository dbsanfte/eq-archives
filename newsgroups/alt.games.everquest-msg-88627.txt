Welcome

Basic game is excellent to start. Plus, you are only out $8 if you decide to
get the trilogy later. Smart descision

> How important are they?

You can get to 60th (top level in the game) and never install the upgrades.
Having said that, they ARE important.

Kunark added some nice hunting areas, specifically for 18+ and again for
40+.

Velious added some nice 35+ hunting grounds.

Luclin add nice hunting grounds also, as well as new spells and items. You
can still get these without luclin, you'd just have to have a friend go and
buy them for you.

The most IMPORTANT thing about the expansions is this: eventually you WILL
want to hunt there or go there with your friends. If they have it and you
don't you're screwed. For levels 1-12 this is NO issue. for 12-30 you can
probably get by without it. For 30+ you will NEED the trilogy for these
reasons. Luclin? maybe you'd never need it... maybe you would :)
