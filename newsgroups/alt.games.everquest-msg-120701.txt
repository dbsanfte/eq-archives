New 51 monk joined our guild recently. Seems nice enough. Didn't talk to
him much.

Posts to guild board this week with a question about baking. Logical.
Lot's of folks starting on various shawl quests, etc. where tradeskills
are required. One person answers with the bat wings and fish method. I
mention the possibility of going to Thurgadin with a fillet knife and
making fillets.

I just read a response back from the monk.

"Ok. Where's thorgadin?"

/em bangs head on table.
