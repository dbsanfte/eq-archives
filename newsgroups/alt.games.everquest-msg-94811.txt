Another alternative is to take the barge from the Oasis of Marr pier
to Ogre Island, then swim South to the spires at the end of Timerous
Deep at loc -12300, +4300, and dive down into the transporter room.
Touch the Erudin fire pot and then take the boat from Erudin to
Qeynos. Note there are 12 pots/lamps there and just touching one will
immediately transport you to that town. If you are KOS in the town you
are transported to, instant death.
