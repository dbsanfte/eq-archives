Anyone know off hand if the 14th level cleric spell "Healing" is 
available in the library in PoK?

My pet twink cleric hit 14 right before I had to log last night. I took 
the book to PoK and popped down to the Vicars in there to buy spells. 
Sure enough, this one merchant has about all of the cleric spells for 
that level. EXCEPT, of course, the one defining cleric spell, my next heal.

If I need to hop a book to Felwith or wherever to get it, that's fine 
and I won't waste any more time tonight in the PoK library, but I was 
just curious if maybe they stuck it on another vendor like the paladins 
or such.
