And it shows.  And it does make the game easier, lots easier, because
now you can xp faster than you could before at easier camps:
Risk reduced + reward increased = easier to progress.
L10 to L60 have been noticeablly compressed by this change, and Druids
and Necros have become noticeably more eager to group, and people have
become a lot touchier about dying (because it interrupts progress for
the CR), or so it seems to me.
