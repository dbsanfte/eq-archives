Pet peeve being me or the other guys?

I did join the group... but when I saw that it consisted of ONE person, 
with the rest "on the way" I bet I could make the run to my trainer and 
back well before the last straggler got there.  Won that bet.  If at any 
point I'd seen the putative people actually in EC on my way out, I'd 
have turned right back around, too.  Didn't feel there was much danger 
of that though.

Getting buffed generally requires everyone show up first.  If getting 
buffed is going to take 10 minutes, and so I wait 10 minutes before 
arriving, I just made it 20 minutes before we are good to go.

I often answer a request to group with the information that I'm going to 
be 5 minutes, or 10 minutes, or that I'm going to show up for buffs but 
then have to go AFK 5 minutes (luckily a Berzerk can do exactly nothing 
for you during the buff phase).  Rarely have I had anyone object... but 
I do feel if I didn't make that caveat up front that I'd be an ass for 
not beating feet as rapidly as my unsowed barbarian legs can carry me.

Yep, I use ignore for "do not group" too.  I also use my Friends list, 
not so much for my friends, as for "invite to group if at all 
convenient"; the "works and plays well with others" group.

Sadly, no, for the most part those people are just ones in whatever 
classes are currently unpopular.  Before the LFG tool, you could easily 
test that theory out simply by making a level one newbie, going anon, 
and sending out "53 ranger LFG" or "53 Cleric LFG" messages and seeing 
how many responses you get on each class.  While your faux member of 
that class wasn't on any friends lists, he surely wasn't on any ignore 
lists either.

That's impossible now, as going LFG puts your class and level up for all 
to see regardless of your settings.
