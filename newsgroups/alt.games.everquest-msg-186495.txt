Amen!  I would just LOVE a fantasy MMORPG that had little to no porting
and where roleplaying was very much expected.  I don't want a "game" I
want a "world".  But chances are I'll never get that because folks like
myself are considered a minority, and so no one will make a game that
matches my ideal.  (I'd also love a MMORPG where stupid people weren't
allowed to play...I think that's why I've given up on it for the
forseeable future. :( Idiots cross all barriers of playstyle, I'm afraid.)
