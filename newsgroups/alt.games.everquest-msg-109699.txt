}Personally I like the plain dictionary definition:
}Evil:
}Anything which impairs the happiness of a being or deprives a
}being of any good; anything which causes suffering of any kind
}to sentient beings; injury; mischief; harm
}Source: Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, ï¿½ 1996, 1998 MICRA, Inc.
}Seems pretty clear to me.

I dunno.  As definitions go, it seems pretty lame to me.  It looks like a 
list of things, most of which, in most circumstances, I would consider 
fairly evil, or at least bad.  But take 'injury' and 'harm' for example.  
I may not like papercuts, but I don't think they in any way suggest that 
the paper is evil.  And mischief... I can think of many mischievous pranks 
that brought about nothing but good.  Is April Fools inehrently evil?

The first two on the list are better... But hey, they both describe taxes 
perfectly.  And there are many who would argue that taxation is for the 
Greater Good.

Webster's a handy man with words and all, but I think he pretty well 
muffed it on this one.  Of course, what exactly evil is is a pretty deep 
philosophical issue and he had eleventy jillion words to get through, so 
who can blame him?  Now, is his negligence in so shoddily defining evil 
yet another form of evil?

}This has to go along with intent of any person
}committing any action of course.

If that's so obvious, why didn't Webster include it?  Are you, perhaps, 
trying to change definitions around to suit your particular whims?  What, 
have you absolutely no moral center?

You were asked for an irrefutable definition of evil, so you decided to 
cite an authoritative source, Webster's, but even -you- didn't think that 
definition was good enough and had to extend it, didn't you?  So how could 
you think that was irrefutable?
