For me it was Legolas. Screw being the king and having a really really cool
sword. I'd trade it anyday for not sinking into the snow and being able to
gaze intently into the distance and seeing what others can't. Not the most
usefull atributes to have, but can you think of anything cooler. I swear to
Tunare ( did I just say that?) If I was thin and athletic and had long blond
hair, I would seriously consider braiding it just like that. Luckely, i'm
not, twould be rather a sad sight.
