	You can't have your cake and eat it too.  If they didn't want Halflings to
be compared to Tolkein's, they shouldn't have copied them.

	That is not what is required.  There are races in EQ with hybrid classes
but not one of the hybrid's "parents" -- Ogre/Troll SKs and BLs, Vah Shir and
Barbarian BLs.  What is required is that the culture have a need for that role
within their society -- and Halflings don't need Rangers.

	Of course there is -- or you wouldn't be arguing.

|No they do NOT make as much sense, and again you are using extremes

|combinations you mentioned in the next patch, and they could rewrite

	And the point is, they would be wrong if they did.

|And the Human monks DID complain. They were jealous  just like you
|acting now.

	They had every right to complain, moreso than Rangers in this instance --
they were trivialized.  (Though at least Iksar Monks paid an experience
penalty -- peck Rangers get a BONUS.)

|Verants game, and Verants storyline. You can take it or leave it, but
|it is not your place (or mine to judge it).

	OF COURSE it is our place to judge it!  We're the paying customers, OF
COURSE we can criticise it!

|There were halflings. Just because they were not modelled on Tolkein

	No, there were kender.  The only things they had in common with Hobbits is
they were short and lived underground -- like half the "little folk" in
northern European myth.
