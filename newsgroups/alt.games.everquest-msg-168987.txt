Yeah.  I'm in an alliance of two guilds that raids together.  We alternate
who gets first pick of drops.  This time it was the other guild that got
first pick, and they chose the veil, so we got the mace.

Yeah.  My usual practice is to just stand there and take the hits until the
MT gets aggro back.  If that doesn't seem to be working, then I DA.  I leave
self-healing as a last resort since it tends to just keep me high on the
hate list.  I'll CE myself if I do chose to self-heal, since that seems to
be a very low-aggro heal.

Heh, yeah.  Just think of the stink some paladins raised over the new hammer
spells.

Thanks for the feedback James; kinda confirms what I suspected about this
drop.
