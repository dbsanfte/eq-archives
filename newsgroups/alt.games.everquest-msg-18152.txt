Because AOL is overpriced and their customer service sucks, not to
mention the fact that their performance on internet access outside
their little "BBS" is one of the worst.

Because Microsoft's products are buggy. There are mail readers and new
readers out there that work better and are free. The only reason I use
Win98 is because 90% of the PC software put out now days only works
under Win
