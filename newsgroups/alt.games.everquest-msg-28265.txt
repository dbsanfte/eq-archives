See, you're making unfounded assumptions here.  We have to work with
the numbers we are given.. which, when broken down shows that not only
is there a very large amount of 50+ players in the game, but the 50-60
demographic overshadows any other comparable level range, and by a
large degree. 

Jensen's original argument was that the percentage of players seeing
the endgame was paltry compared to the rest of the player base.
Breaking down the level ranges pretty much blows that theory to
peices.
