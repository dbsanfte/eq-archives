The ballots where recounted 6 times. Each of the 6 times they where
recounted bush won. Your "facts" are materially in error.

Not only where the people counting such votes democrats. They where cheating
to such an extent that observers where not allowed to watch them.

Not one single black voter in florida could ever be produced that was denied
his right to cast a legal ballot. This even with 1000`s of people looking
for just such a single person

Actually it is completely clear that he lost. This from a voter for Harry
browne. Incidently the democrats got up in front of a court and argued that
all votes for Harry browne should be counted for Gore since it was obvious
that all of those votes where cast in error. That those voting for the
libertarian canidate where just confused and meant to vote liberal a common
adjective for democrat. This pissed me off like you could just not believe .
