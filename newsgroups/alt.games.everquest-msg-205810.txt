I, a level 60 Necromancer, and a 58 Shaman and 55 Mage went to Hate's Fury
recently.  I had never been to the zone before, and they had only done the
entrance area.  We cleared our way to the back of the ship and started down
the other side before having to log, but it was definitely a great dungeon
crawl experience.  A group of late 40ish players should be able to do this
place and have a great time.  Part of the fun is that named can spawn in
just about any place.  Best of luck in your dungeon crawling crawling.  I
hope LDoN will offer many great crawling opportunities.
