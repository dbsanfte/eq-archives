Whats important is NOT KEI but that it has exposed a serious flaw in
EQ. Too much downtime for all classes. THe manna regen rate needs to
be to some sane amount and have KEI add to that if you like. Problem
is that hitpoints also need to be redone even worse than manna regen.
What confuses me is why there is no melee "kei" in the game, kinda a
aego+Regrowth type of spell with the same 3 hour life. If KEI is good
for casters then this would be good for melee, cant say one is good
without saying the other is needed badly. Heh on the other hand bet it
never happens as melee is always getting shat apon.
