We already have efforts to perform the same task for books...

I think its a valuable part of history. Just keep the source code then
and the language specifications. (those are already documented). Then
its no different from preserving "books".

Admittedly some micro-bits around cpu/gpu optimization might only
exist in processor instructions, but its very a small part of the
code. And the cpu specs are also well documented already. (And those
that are not... like some of the console ones *should* be.

I don't disagree. But it would have to be extended to 20 years or
more. EA still re-releases old games well over 10 years old. They
deserve to keep that revenue source. As well as console titles: PS1 is
still kicking around and moving discs.

But your solution *doesn't* resolve the DMCA issues. If software
company X devises a good drm manner of *enforcing* copyright it will
be illegal to break it. And if the software no longer exists in useful
form after copyright exists it won't be possible to break it DMCA or
not. (And this isn't unlikely... the riaa/mpaa are actively seeking to
drm video and music in such a way that you buy x-replays or unlimited
replays for x=days. 

If they ever get it going the software industry is sure to follow... 2
years after you buy Diablo 2 it deletes itself of your hard disk and
you won't be able to say boo because all you bought (because all they
would sell you) was a 2 year license... and that's exactly what you
got.
