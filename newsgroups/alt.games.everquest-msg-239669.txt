Ok firstly, lets cover what they actually do (at work and going from memory,
so i will miss some)

Mark NPC
   You can target a mob (and press the hotkey), placing a target ring around
the mob that your whole group can see
Delegate Mark NPC
   Same as above except you can designate other people to do the marking
Delegate Main Assist
   You select a group member as MA, and every mob they target will have a
target ring visible to your whole group
NPC Health
   Used in conjunction with one of the above, puts the mobs HP % above the
mob (by its name), so you can see a mobs HP without targeting it
HP/Mana Enhancement
   Gives 30 per rank at level 1 and 2, gives 40 at level 3 to add a round
100 to either. Similar deal for attack (but 30ish attack)
Regen
   Regen.. dont know the amt. Regen is worthless
Spell Awareness
   Doesnt create more spam, but instead allows your whole group to see spell
info.  No more "xxx begins to cast a spell", now you will see "xxx begins to
cast a spell <Complete Heal>. SO basically it appends <spellname> to the end
of the message, works on mobs and PC's
Buff Thingy
   Targetable hotkey, to sense somebodies buffs (creates a list of text).
Level 2 shows duration too.
Find NPC
   Find lost groupies using a bazaar-style find trail
Health of Targets Target
   Creates a new window, showing name and % health bar, of whoever your
target is targeting.  If targeting the MA, you see the % of his current mob.
If you select a mob, you will see the name and HP of whoever he is hitting
(updated constantly)

Thats most of them...
The ones I have -
Delegate MA, NPC health, Health of Targets Target, Spell Awareness, Health
enhancement

The WOW awsome ones are delegate MA, and Health of Targets Target (HoTT)
HoTT owns in every scenario. For pulling, for tagging, for patch healing,
for keeping track of mobs health, it is just great.
Im a big fan of delegate MA too.

So i recommend delegate MA, then HoTT.
The health/mana are decent i guess, but 18 leader points for 100 of either,
is pretty whacked.

-m

ps HoTT friggin owns
