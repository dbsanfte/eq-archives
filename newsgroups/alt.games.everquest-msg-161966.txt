Help me out here.  My ranger, level 52, *just* made master at archery.  She's
got a compound steelshaft bow, 28-40, 9 damage ponus, poison 3, 200 range, with
some other stats, (just got it about a week ago, when I made master).
I usually use a 3/150 arrow, but have also used some magic arrows, (silvertip
3/150).
I don't do that much damage with my bow.  The most I've seen is around 116
against a dark blue mob, when I get a double bonus or something like that, and
I'm guessing that the "average" including *misses* is around 30, at the VERY
highest. 
I'm getting the impression from the Nerfing! Nerfing! post that *someday* I'm
going to be able to do REAAAAAALLLL damage with a bow?  (At 116 damage it would
take my whole quiver of arrows to kill a dark blue mob.... am I missing
something?)
It seems to me that at *some* point I should be able to kill a mob "outright"
with one arrow,  just as you can kill something IRL with one arrow.  Is that
going to happen?
