I killed for about 45 minutes in Seb last night ( just dinged 51 and this 
was my first EXPing since ) before the General raid.  My EXP bar didn't 
really move.  Admittedly, it was just me, a CLC, RNG, and PAL, and we were 
pulling near the zone and the first rock.

I've heard horror stories of 50+ EXP, and didn't notice that 50 was too 
bad.  Is 51 MUCH worse than 50?  I know it gets worse post-50, but how bad 
are we talking here if I just get by ass in an EXP grind mode?
