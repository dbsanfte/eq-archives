Honestly, and believe it or not, I mean no offense here, I think that the  
"KEI for lowbies" lovers are basically ignored by many of those who are 
against it, with the feeling being that that crowd is always going to 
insist on conditions which promote success with less effort. It's kind of 
like every player on every little league team having to get the same 
trophy regardless of their performance so that everyone can get a sense 
of accomplishment, whether it is justified or not. It cheapens the 
reward.
