I apologize in advance if this has been noted and posted earlier.

In the days of old, I was able to park my bard on a boat, fire up a
song, and practice my instrument skills.  Yet ever since Verant fixed
the whole boat issue, whenever I attempt to play a song, I get the
message, "You are too distracted to cast a spell at this time." (or
something similar).  The boat can just be sitting there and the
message appears.  Only when I am on stable ground once more will any
song start to sing.

Quite annoying, especially since bards do not even cast spells and
have to suffer that same penalty now.
