Don't worry about power leveling too much, in my experience finding a good
exp spot and just playing there (which means you are having fun, working
with the group etc. which may mean you die sometimes - something PLers never
do :-) ), you can do a level in about 4-6 hours (obviously longer for hell
levels).  1-5 obviously just the newbie area, 5-12 EC or Orc Hill in
GFay/Crushbone, 12-17 Oasis, 17-21 Highpass/LoIO, 22-32 Highkeep/LoIO, 32-40
(or even higher) Lower Guk.  I am only lvl 39 so can't tell you past that.
Just to give an example I did from from lvl 22-39 in four weeks in Highkeep
and Lower Guk playing about 5 hours a day, 4 days a week.  Lake of Ill Omen
is supposed to be good as well as FM and Dreadlands after that but I find
that in the Kunark zones you seem to spend a lot of time not doing anything
(running around, the zones are huge/ LFG etc) unless you are solo.  Then
there is the great drawback that you miss out on dungeon experience, which
will be useful at later levels.  Granted you don't NEED to have it until
then, but it is useful.

The other problem is with gaining lvls too fast is you miss out on seeing a
lot of the game and having fun.  This last stint of doing 17 lvls in four
weeks I don't feel I missed on much because I had already explored a lot of
areas before lvl 22 and found highkeep, and also at lvl 32 and found Lower
Guk.  And that is probably my best advice, get a list of areas that people
say is good for exp at your particular level, and then try each one until
you find one you are happy with.  And most importantly, just have fun.
