Elites do drop the Gnoll skins its just a rarer drop than
the pelts.
My rogue must have killed hundreds of these damn things
before getting the 4 YES 4 measley Skins I needed.

Kick and round kick are linked, if you use kick, then round
kick can't be used and vice versa.  Go with round kick, it
does more damage.

Practice Mend when you can, also practice safe fall.  Being
in the Qeynos area, kill two birds with one stone.  Go over
the gates to the city, and jump off, you will be practicing
your safe fall, and you can use mend to heal yourself.  It
will also give you some bind wound practice most likely. 
While boring it's something to do if you can't find a group,
or are waiting for friends to log in etc.
Mend isn't all that reliable till you get around 100 skill.
