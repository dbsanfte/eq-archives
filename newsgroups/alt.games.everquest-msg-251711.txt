They were also rushed in to Luclin's release to counter DaoC's promise
at the time of ridable mounts. EQ's mounts actually ended up superior to
the glorified taxi's that horses ended up being in DaoC. Personally
I can't stand horses and only use the cheapest one for stupidly long
fights like Xegony. I found places where I needed to use a horse for
experiencing like the second castle in Fire to be extremely boring so
I just stopped doing them. Being stuck on a horse in order to keep mana
up on experience grinds reminds me too much of the bad old days of heal,
sit, med and heal again.
