I completely disagree.  Just about all equipment for Rogue's come with Dex
(even though it's usefulness is very overrated).  If you're going to start
over, don't skimp on STA.  Sta is very hard to raise to 100 or over so give
yourself a headstart there.  You can't swing a dead cat without hitting some
armour that has Str/Dex/etc but you'll be glad for the Sta in a long fight
and when your HPs are just a little bit higher.


If you want a toon for trade skills, make up an erudite or something of
another class and pass the plat over to him, don't sacrifice the utiltiy of
a good rogue just for that purpose.
Or, do what I do, and bank the various INT or WIS (pick one) pieces you loot
for the days when you go into town and do trade skills.  I think I've got a
WIS of 75 and have it 100ish on tradeskill days, without making myself less
useful when I'm grouped in combat.
