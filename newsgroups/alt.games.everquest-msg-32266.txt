I'm not twinked. I'm just level 53 ;) It is funny, what you say,
but to test it out I created a male gnome enchanter.... Guess what
happened?

I couldnt resist saying hi to my friends. As soon as they realised
it was me.... massive twinkage inc!

I guess the gnome was as cute as a male by virtue of being a gnome
as my main is as a half elf amazon ;)

Honestly though, heres a little insight... I have 2 "twinks" I
rarely play. They have packs *full* of junk that "should" be worth
200-300pp each. But it takes so goddam long to find a buyer its not
worth the time it takes to sell them by the time I actually get a
sale. I just get too bored.

Now, this is on terris-thule, a split server. I hate to think about
the item glut that must be occuring on my old server, Bertoxxulous...

It totally kills the economy. We're in a situation where nobody
bothers to sell or trade anything but the high end items because
its just not worth the time and as a result theres so little liquidity
in the market that nobody can raise the cash to buy the high end
items, and people wont trade one high end item for another because
they wont be able to sell (secondary high end item) on anyway.
