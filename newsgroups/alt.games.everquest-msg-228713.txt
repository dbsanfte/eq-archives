But they're advertising property as being sold...By your statement,
the fact that no property is being sold brings it back to criminal
activity. False advertising at least. They're advertising that they're
selling ownership of something that you're suggesting doesn't even
really exist and, thus, can't be owned.

Virtual property is still a grey area legally, so I'd say it's also
careless to state with certainty that no property is being sold...
