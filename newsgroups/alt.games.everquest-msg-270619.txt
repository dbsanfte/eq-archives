Knowing more about what I am doing isn't necessarily a good thing; I 
found that the principle thing I was interested in with missions is the 
reward item... and that 95% of the reward items aren't interesting to 
me.  This means I'm going thru page after page of missions looking for 
one with a reward I'd want.

Reward I'd want: I found one with a nano crystal for Group Heal; this is 
a nano ability that heals everyone in my group, and heals for more than 
my starting nano.  This sort of thing is much more important than a 
marginally better gun, and much much more important than a gun or piece 
of armor or something thats useful to some other class.


If there was a robust trading economy out there, then this wouldn't be 
such a problem, but as it is, the reason I'm willing to go thru lots of 
pages of missions looking for a good one is because its the one way I 
have to actually get items I want, other than the very low random chance 
of something useful actually dropping.

Unlike EQ LDoN missions, there's no timer on getting a new set of 
missions if you don't like the ones you are first offered; you get 5 at 
a time to pick from, and can get a new set instantly.

The downside is that each set of five costs some credits; at level 9 
they were costing me 7 credits each, which is truely a drop in the 
bucket considering I've got over 10k credits and I'm not at all good at 
earning money.  I hear this goes as high as 300 credits at the upper 
levels of the game... and thats still probably a drop in the bucket, 
although you might throw away 10 sets of five looking for a good one.

I found a locked door in another mission.  Thats one chest and one door 
in over 10 missions.  Later I found a lockpick, in the general store in 
Rome, haven't used it yet.

This information may be incorrect, I have yet to see another token.  It 
seems the chance to get a token is based on how many of the mobs in the 
mission area you have killed when you complete the mission, killing the 
rest afterwards doesn't help.

I saw an item, for 20kcr or so, which will let you change apartments (I

It looks to me like you can read those books while they are on the 
vendor, but maybe I'm wrong

Backpack can be put on your back, but I bought a second one and it works 
fine in inventory as well.  There are also much larger packs, it seems 
you need some adventuring skill to wear them.

I joined a team and went into the subway, it was an experience much like 
grouping with total newbies in EQ; two soldiers and my adventurer, 
running around not talking (I didn't talk much either because I was too 
busy trying to keep up with them) attacking targets more or less 
together, hardly working as a real team at all.  Still, my proud 
posession of that group heal ability made it possible to keep everyone 
afloat fairly well.  They were both much better than me at taking 
damage; when I got aggro I lost a lot more of my hp bar.

Funny thing, though, I started running low on nano in a way that I never 
do when soloing; because I tend to alternate nano healing with 
treatments, so the treatments refresh my nanos.  With the soldiers 
taking the damage, I was reluctant to use treatments to regain nanos, 
since this wastes the heal that goes along with it.

Later, I went on a solo mission where I looted something similar to 
first aid, which restores just nanos, but lots of them, and something 
similar to treatment, which restores nanos only while sitting and not in 
combat, but lots and lots of them.  So this will help next time.

I also looted a treatment kit which restores only hp; also pretty handy 
at times when I'm full on nanos but injured.

I found all of the above in stores... the cost is in the four or five 
figures for them!

And I had to get some skills up that I'd neglected, in order to use 
them, but by now I'm used to that and never spend all my IP when I 
level, I just hit the basics and then wait for equipment to make demands.

The team didn't last all that long, but while it was operating, even as 
poorly as it did, it was definately far more powerful than me alone, the 
soldiers did better damage than me I think, and at any rate, there were 
four guns blazing away at each bad guy, instead of just my two.  When 
things got hairy, I spent my time keeping them healed with my single and 
group heal nanos.

I wonder what nanos soldiers have, and if they could have buffed me up 
with them; I know my Enforcer and Engineer had buffs they could put on 
others to make them more powerful (admittedly, the enforcer one would 
only help if you happen to use one handed blunt weapons...)
