Invis vs undead makes you invisible to the undead walking around kith at
night.  However, you are NOT invisible to the living creatures walking
around (namely the dread wolves), and once they spot you and start attacking
you, your invis vs undead spell drops, and now the undead can kill you.
Kith is once of those "damned if you do, damned if you don't" kind of zones.
