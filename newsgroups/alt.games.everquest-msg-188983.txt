While this was my first thought I came to find out that in the process of
the fan dying on this thing (caught the problem a little late) the fan has
adhered itself to the card.  Even after removing the little pin thingies, it
still is wedged to the card.  Otherwise I'd still get a new card, but repair
this one and save it for a second machine.  Ah well, guess I'll learn from
this to keep a more careful eye on things in the future.  :)
