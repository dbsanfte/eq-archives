So does 2-boxing, getting PL'd, my warrior twink with a fungi....

There's still so many shortcuts in EQ, what's the big deal about KEI?
All it means is that casters also have an easy road to high lvls (if
they want to take it), something that the melees and 2 boxers have had
all along.

Granted, the ability to regen significant mana on the run is a huge
benefit for casters but they'll the right skills at higher lvls
anyway. A lvl 45+ will still be able to buy KEI, (fewer) people will
still be selling it. In a group, I don't see KEI as a big dead, people
will still need the same skills but a few will just have to learn them
at higher lvls like any melee twink. Solo, I don't really care. 

Basically though, it adds DPS.  But so does the fact that you can get
melee weapons these days for under 200p that would've been unheard of
even at the high end before Kunark first came out while casters sare
till working with basically the same DPS as they had back then.
...maybe 20% higher if you figure in the right focus items.

Actually, what they'll see is a sharp decline in the numbers of the
pure casting classes. Just like the situation you had before KEI was
in the game and for the same reasons.
