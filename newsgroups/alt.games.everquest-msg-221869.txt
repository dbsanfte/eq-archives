    No. When we have off days, or on weekends before raiding, everyone is in
LDoN. So much so that the officers had to rule that anyone late for raid
time because of LDoN should get an administrative warning. Most of us don't
care about XP as much as we do getting augments, so we don't go to PoP. I
can't even remember the last time I was in an Earth group. The people that
do care about XP are the ones packing into BoT.

    In the past three weeks to a month, this is the change in the number of
characters with at least one win in a theme on Quellious: Guk has gone from
around 1300 to 1700 (still most unpopular by a wide margin). Rujark, Takish,
and Miragul's have gone from 2500 to 3000-3500 each. Mistmoore has gone from
5000 to 7000. That's a lot of people - Mistmoore alone saw between 60 and
100 new players per day.
