To be honest, the only "good" places to hunt for silk are East Karana off of
crag spiders (about 20th level) and heart spiders (don't recall what level) in
Upper Guk. Both are VERY dangerous places for someone of your level, and both
kinds of spiders have very nasty poisons that will flatten a human monk of any
level in no time at all.

Your best bet right now is to hunt giant spiders in West Karana. With them,
silk is a rare drop and you still have to worry about poison (take along a
cleric, shaman or druid of about your level.) They will remain your best source
until you can hunt carrion spiders in East Karana about 17th level. You might
want to try the spiders on Wisp Island in Erud's Crossing, but they are quite
social and will swarm you unless you are very careful in isolating them. And
don't forget the healer!
