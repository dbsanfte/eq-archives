Tonight's patch seems to have cleared up most of the issues I
mentioned earlier. The black boxes are gone, there's considerably less
lag, and I can actually see my surroundings.
I haven't noticed the white cursor that other posters have mentioned,
so maybe I'm lucky.
If the game continues to play at this level I'll be quite happy. I'll
still almost certainly get more RAM- from what I've seen getting up to
256 from 64 should be fairly cheap. A new video card might wait for a
bit, depending on pricing. If there's a nice one fairly cheap out
there, I'll likely get it- not merely for EQ, but for RPGs like
Arcanum, that also seem to dislike the Intel video cards.
Thanks for the words of wisdom tonight, and have fun out there.
Regards,
The Beatnik
