52 warrior with 150 str, and a FBSS for haste, according to Copelands:

Lamentation Primary, Cane of Tranquil seconday: 978 damage per minute

Cane of Tranquil Primary, Lamentation secondary: 891 DPM

Lamentation Primary, Lamentation Secondary: 1002 DPM

Lamentation Primary, Crystalline Short Sword Secondary: 1013 DPM

Crystalline Short Sword Primary, Lamentation Secondary: 954 DPM

For giggles:

Wurmslayer Primary, Lamentation Secondary: 972 DPM

Wurmslayer Primary, Crystalline Short Sword Secondary: 983 DPM

Lamentation Primary, Club of Ice Ocean Secondary: 1058 DPM

Lamentation Primary, Jade Mace Secondary: 1014 DPM

Lamentation Primary, Venemous Axe of the Velium Brood Secondary: 989 DPM
(+10 ac, and the proc, which I had to factor out here because the VAOTVB is
not listed under copelands, and the only other 11/24 weapons I could find
either had procs which would screw up the calculation, or were not slashing
weapons, and so the skill check wouldn't be the same)

Club of the ice ocean, despite being rather ugly, is a pretty common drop
off Lodizal, and you can likely get one for less than the cost of a lammy
or CSS.
