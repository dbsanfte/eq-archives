I would sow you in tunnel if I had it memmed, but these days thats not
usually the case with my druid. I have soe for casting on others (sow
+levi+lasts for ages+others), but I cant cast that on a lvl 14.

Now if I had more spell slots i might keep sow memmed permanently, but of
course 8 is the magic number we must not go beyond. (sounds like monty
python)
