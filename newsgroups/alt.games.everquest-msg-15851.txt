My personal beliefs as to best full outdoor group aside, I think the
point of the 4 rogue/necro/shaman team was to fear kite... Necros
already do it solo, you're just adding 4 backstabbing machines into the
mix; be there forever? I don't think so. Between any dot's cast (might
even be a waste of mana...), any pets, and 4 backstabbing rogues, things
don't last long. The rogues won't have to tank any more than a regen can
take care of easily.
