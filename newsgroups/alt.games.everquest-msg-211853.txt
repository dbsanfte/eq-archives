My cleric soloed the flies quite a lot after the release of POP, and was plenty
faster than them on run 3, my bard later soloed them in swarms and was faster
than them on TBoots and even on run 2 (he still hasn't gotten run 3).  He was
faster than them on run 1 but not by enough to make up for cornering and lag and
things like that, he'd get tagged too often to stop using TBoots at that level.
Snare also seemed to work normally; he'd snare a mob so his pet could get its
attention, or snare to stop runners, or snare to split a mob out of the swarm for
killing, never noticed them acting any less snared than other types of mobs.

The surprise you are looking for is less prevalent in flies than in rats, but
unless its been fixed, POD mobs have a nasty trick, get them very low on HP and
running and if you aren't actively damaging them they suddenly shoot up to 40% HP
again.  For my bard, this meant killing 6 mobs in a row via swarm was easy, then
the very last mob (which would run, as it had no heathy social brothers to keep
it coming at him) would be nearly impossible to kill, he often ended up either
grabbing more mobs to fight or just giving up and zoning out with the last mob
still alive.  For a wizard, I imagine the problem could be even worse, kill 3 of
the 4 in your swarm and that last hanger on becomes invulnerable unless you have
the mana to kill him in one big blast.  Or maybe not, after all, my cleric easily
solved that problem by using the one big blast system.
