Hey, brownturtlepokinghisheadout, what's your problem? The original
poster came on here acting like a juvenile asshole, and some people laid
into him. And you and others jump on the people telling him he's a
fucking idiot? News flash: anyone that would post the thread opener that
he did IS a fucking idiot. As much of a fucking idiot as those who post
a single word message to the extend of "plonk" to let you know that they
are killfiling someone. Whatever.

It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
