Hello,
     Right after GoD was released, I took my Druid into Dagnors just
to see if Bilge might be up. There was a yellow to 59 mob named
Praklion of the Cauldron on track. I went looking for him and suddenly
I'm looking at a very big ugly fish, I'd estimate dragon size. I
conned it and found Scowls, Ready to Attack, at which point I made for
the surface and Unrest as fast as my little Druid legs would carry me.
I later heard that he AE stuns and hits for 450, but thats an
unconfirmed report. Does anyone know more about this mob and what he
drops? Mostly curious to see if anyone has killed him yet.

Ken
