Another note about the Cazic Thule gate complaint.

Even before I heard about the Lesser Evac trick, I was routinely
gating here with out much difficulty.  Never once did I not have time
to throw up an invis.  It was a still a risk but I had good luck and
the game is not much fun for me, personally, without risk.

Once again see my other post about imaginative casters.

Better yet, change classes to something you enjoy.

You might also think about switching to a game with cheat codes.  That
is not a flame.  There is nothing wrong with that, if thats what you
enjoy.
