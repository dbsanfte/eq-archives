fair point, so here's the language of the actual judge in the adobe
case:

Adobe argues that the first sale doctrine does not apply because Adobe
does not sell or authorize any sale of its software. Adobe
characterizes each transaction throughout the entire stream of
commerce as a license. Adobe asserts that its license defines the
relationship between Adobe and any third-party such that a breach of
the license constitutes copyright infringement. [**12]  This assertion
is not accurate because copyright law in fact provides certain rights
to owners of a particular copy. This grant of rights is independent
from any purported grant of rights from Adobe. The Adobe license
compels third-parties to relinquish rights that the third-parties
enjoy under copyright law.

In short,  [**13]  the terms of the Adobe EULA at issue prohibit
licensees from transferring or assigning any individual Adobe product
that was originally distributed as part of a Collection unless it is
transferred with all the software in the original Collection. This
license provision conflicts with the first sale doctrine in copyright
law, which gives the owner of a particular copy of a copyrighted work
the right to dispose of that copy without the permission of the
copyright owner.


and the court resolves the fact that while something may be called a
license, it may in fact be a sale:

A number of courts have held that the sale of software is the sale of
a good within the meaning of Uniform Commercial Code. Advent Sys. Ltd.
v. Unisys Corp., 925 F.2d 670, 676 (3d Cir. 1991);


but notice how it says 'a number of courts' and not all courts ... so
i feel i've proven my point that there is disagreement within the law
about the fact that sony says you're licensing their product while
some people think you actually own it (based on "the economic
realities of the transaction")





i'm willing to concede that it may be coincidental that wikipedia
happened to be accurate
