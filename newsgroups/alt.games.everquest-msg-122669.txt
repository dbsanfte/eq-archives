Well, for starters... you have the effects the wrong way round... Bracelets
are Efficiency, Talisman is Haste :o)


Do you have Conjuration as your Speciality? For Druids the choices are
usually Conjuration for DoTs or Evocation for nukes.

Off hand, I can't recall the mana saving for a successful Speciality check,
but if it's 10% or more (unlikely unless your Specialisation is pretty high)
then Efficiency doesn't stack... only the best of the 2 works. Same for AA
Abilities... if the bonus is better than the focus item would give, then the
focus item is ignored (although it might still 'sparkle').
