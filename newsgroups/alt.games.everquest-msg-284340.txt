Phinny popped yesterday, at a fairly slow time of day for my guild. 
They've also killed him before, and are somewhat ho hum about it, but 
the truth is there are quite a few classes who need to kill him for epic 
drops, and any good guild is going to kill him dozens of times over 
because of this.  Nonetheless, this wasn't made a manditory raid, so the 
20 or so people that showed up were a fairly ragtag force.

How ragtag, you ask?

So ragtag that my 48 SK was apparantly the best pick for MT.

Well, we buffed up at the zone in, then the plan was made, we'd clear 
the entrance area, then a small team would go down to the ledge, aggro 
Phinny, and gate back to entrance to pull him there.

I'm not sure whether that plan would have worked at all, I suspect this 
behavior has been fixed.  But there was a complication; a group of 
members of another guild showed up as we were still buffing and being 
generally disorganized, and headed down towards the ledge as well.

Confusion broke out right and left, somehow the ledge team pulled Phinny 
but didn't bring him up, instead the order was shouted to come to the ledge.

Well we set off, but of course invis broke on several people on the way 
down, including myself.  We became entangled in a mass of mobs including 
Cauldronboil, and eventually split into two groups; those who were still 
invis went on to Phinny, the rest formed into one little mass and 
eventually wiped on the 10+ assorted sharks and fish.

Phinny died and dropped NO epic quest parts, just to further complete 
our day.

We moved on and dropped VS remains as well, but by now one of the guild 
50+ warriors was online, and I was demoted back out of MT status.

Never saw the mob we were killing, never got one Cheal (clerics got 
lucky and didn't break invis) but there you have it, thats my day in the 
sun, MT on a raid as an SK.
