A citizen of the US who is living in the real world rather than
daddy's pocketbook. The numbers economists use to determine a
recession is "over" are useless for a REAL picture of how the economy
is. Sure, business may be healthy, but where are they having their
grunt labor done? Factories in Mexico, anyone?

I know the job market is in the crapper worse now than it was 2 years
ago. I know the average joe who's not in the top income brackets is
having to scrape by. I know employers are getting away with paying
less because they have their pick of a huge crop of job-seekers. I
know that companies have repeatedly said that every time they put out
a job listing, they have thousands of applications by the end of the
first day.

Anyone who thinks that's a health economy is either an idiot or a
liar. Which is it?
