    The bandits come in multiples, always, and hit hard (for XP mobs). All
it would take is one bad experience with them for folks to not want to do
them. Honestly, they may also have been worried about your ability as a bard
to mez adds - most folks think crowd control = enchanter.

    Now that's impressive. I was always under the (mistaken, I guess)
impression that after three mobs a bard was really pushing it in terms of
mezzing. What are the exact mechanics of bard mez, anyways?

    That's part of it. Whenever some of my guildmates group outside the
guild they are shocked by skills/equipment levels that they take for
granted.

    Well, to be honest, why would they? Risk vs. reward and all that. When I
grind XP I want the most possible XP in the least possible time, not to sit
around wondering why my guildmates have 60+ AA points and I have 20.

    CT has too much class-specific loot. The XP is exceptional, though.
