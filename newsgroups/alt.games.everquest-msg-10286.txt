Its sort of a bug. Davian is right, it only happens sometimes when
they die in your group so you have their name to track. I've also had
it happen when I was tracking them in the first place then they died.

Yeah it also might sort of work with them zoning out while they have a
corpse since you have to be tracking them basically for it to work.
I've not tried the zoning out thing.

A ranger or a druid can't just "track a corpse" though. It is a bug
which needs the right conditions which makes it easier just to find a
necro, bard or sk.
