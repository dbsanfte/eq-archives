And that could be the first mistake. :)

The best literature is written because the author wants to tell a story 
not sell a book. Its the old 'true to the vision' vs 'pandering to the 
lowest common denominator' argument, really.

For $29 bucks sure. 

But For $1.00 its hard to find fault with it, *even* if all they did was 
rearrange mobs, add some named and quests, and update textures. 

I agree people want to *see* something new, so revamps will never be as 
satisifying as new zones if they are just re-mobbed/re-itemized/re-
textured. A zone has to be re-geometried too to be really 'interesting' 
and new. (And why can't the aviaks build themselves a fortess-aerie in 
South K, train their warriors to 70th level, and sign on with one of the 
new Dragon factions to unleash their long awaited vengeance....)

I'm confident that for $12.00 per account they can do a dozen real 
revamps per year, (completely rebuild the zone) and integrate them with 
the current expansion theme, along with a couple dozen quest/mob 
rearrangements/re-itemizations of other zones.

$12 may not seem like much, but we're talking largely reusing models and 
textures from the current expansion, and we're not adding any code 
features (no AAs, no UI features, thus no 'difficult coding' etc etc).

I agree that when a new expansion comes out people for the most part 
*do* want to spend the bulk of their time there, but I don't know anyone 
that's averse to hitting old zones a bit, especially if its relevant to 
the new zones. (e.g. a fair example of what I'm talking about are the 
various epic encounters... but a really good example doesn't exist.)

I'd like to see the old zones peripherally integrated with the new 
content, so you spend most of your time in the new zones, but the old 
zones have relevant contributions... a trigger spawn added to Vex Thal 
that's needed as a *small part* of a OOW quest/progressive item. I don't 
want to drag the guild to VT night after night when the latest expansion 
comes out... but nobody minds spending one day in VT now and then, 
especially when the reward is 'modern', and the triggered event is new.

That integration is important. SOE can't put better gear in revamped 
zones for obvious reasons: that it would piss off the players *and* hurt 
expansion sales, but if they put anything less its only interesting for 
10 minutes. But if they tie them together... then it gains traction as 
being relevant, without undermining sales.

And I, at least, have never suggested the march of progress on new 
content should slow. That said... in practical terms the difference 
between a complete revamp and new content is the name of the zone.
