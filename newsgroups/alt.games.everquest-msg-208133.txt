Exp bonus is a misnomer.

Each zone has a Zone Experience Modifier
attached to it.  It is a whole number that
is part of the base xp formula for a mob
(Mob_Level^2 * ZEM * Group_Bonus)

Zones such as DL have a ZEM=75,
the Hole is 100, UP is 90, Tier
1 planes are now 119 (used to be
145 before the recent changes)

Most of the ZEM's are listed at
http://www.knightsofloyalty.com/expcalc.php
in the dropdown box at the top.
