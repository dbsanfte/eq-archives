That isn't what he said.

He didn't say that all religions are basically the same; he said that anyone
who takes their religion too seriously has problems.

If you're going to kill me because I don't follow your religion then yes,
you take your religion WAY too seriously.

If you work desperately hard to cause others pain and suffering in the name
of your religion, then again, you take your religion far too seriously.


Now me, I'd add the following:

If your religion exalts death, and you can't wait to die in the service of
your religion, then there's something seriously wrong with you and/or your
religion.
