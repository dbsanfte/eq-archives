As a shaman without snare, I have no choice if I must kite.  I rarely do 
kite, as any mob that is snarable is generally also rootable, and my most 
efficient method of damage is DoTs.  For mobs that I can take a beating 
from, I will just sit on my Drogmor next to them, and allow my pet plus my 
DoTs to kill them, while I keep myself healed.  In the rare instances where 
I want to kill a nonsummoning, nonrootable mob, and there is room, I can 
kite them just fine.
