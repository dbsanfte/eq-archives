Cannabis - yes, it's been around for a long time, but not under that
particular name.  That's the scientific nomenclature for it (cannabis
sativa).  Now, if you wanted to use "hemp", that'd be a different
kettle of fish.

"spring assisted knives" are a very recent invention.  They most
certainly didn't exist in the middle ages (equivalent to EQ
timeframe).

When I petition a name, I always C&V it.  Problem is that some of the
Guides simply don't care; they'll declare that the name's legal no
matter what.

I've got a few names that top my annoyance list in re this:

Berllis Serel (Guide told me that because it has 2 spelling
differences, rather than 1, that it's alright),
Tamerlane (Guide wouldn't take my word for it that it's the name of a
real, historical person),
and of course Muaddib (Guide said that it's a perfectly legitimate
Arabic name) and his 4 misspelled cousins.

(So, if he can use a "perfectly legitimate Arabic name", can I use
Conan, which is a perfectly legitimate Irish name?)
