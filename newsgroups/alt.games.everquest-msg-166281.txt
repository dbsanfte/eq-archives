I always find shouts of "Camp Check", irritating and the pinnacle of
non roleplaying. Its a constant reminder of everything wrong with a
limited resource simulation played by more people it can handle.

Its moot anyway. There is no "camp" supported by the maker, who is the
only law, so I don't bother answering either. 

The most irritating area is killing anything in butcher since people
continually shout it due to those tiny ghetto goblin camps. I'm going
to write verant about the oddity of those having drops which sell to
npcs for 5 plat when they can be done by people level 10 or so. Maybe
if they nerf the crud out of them this goofy behavior will stop. At
first I would chime in, answering the camp check on the once prized 3
dwarf lady camp by shore, but it soon became clear that these people
were only interested in those stupid two goblin camps. I don't bother
anymore and if someone checks and comes along saying, "hey you did not
answer camp check!" I'll just say

"so?"

and explain if they are persistant. Then I'll explain how our
conversation is all moot since camping is not supported and they have
now made me tired and if they want to be so incredibly petty I'm sure
that I can find something else to do. 

The idiots in butcherblock should just be more explicit and shout,
"Are the TWO GOBLIN CAMPS camped?"
I mean god, cut to the freaking chase.
