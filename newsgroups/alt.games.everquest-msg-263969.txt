Actually unless they have changes things recently, different races get exp
+/- modifiers for experience, one i know for sure is halfling druids
definately get less exp than a gnome wiz or a woodelf war. I have paired in
these cpmbos and know the exp was uneven, the halfling getting less exp, not
by much but after an hour it was clearly visible. Also if grouped with a
higher character you actually get a little less exp, based on the priciple a
higher char does more towards the kill so should get more exp.
Still i would say these diferences would only add up to about 50-75% of a
yellow bubble per level, though this can add up after a while.
