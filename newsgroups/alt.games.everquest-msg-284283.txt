When I used to farm the AC back in the day, all I did was kill the out
of place named spawns.  The normal spawns are like "a sand mummy" or
"a desert asp", "a desert madman".  Using tracking you can find the
out of place mobs like "a mummy", "an asp", "a coyote", "a madman",
etc.  Kill one and another would spawn in it's place.  Keep killing
that spawn and you'd get the AC in no time.  I typically got one about
every night before logging off then selling multi-quest rights.  Oh..I
also would turn my speakers up LOUD.  You could hear the AC
walking/crunching the sand with the volume up.  I beat many people to
the AC spawn because of this.

Not sure the exact story, and read all I could about this little
gnome.  If you ID'd the GBS it comes back as "Varsoon's Black Heart"
or something like that.  Never read about anyone ever figuring it out.
With a tracker it was pretty easy to spawn Pyzjin though.  Her or her
PH would spawn and make it's way to the center of those ruins.  Once
you found the PH, use track and keep killing that PH as it pops.
Can't even begin to count how many times I had to kill her before I
finally looted a GBS.

This one was finally solved...of course after I had left EQ and went
thru hell getting the drop for 2 different magicians I leveled.
Something about the PH being on a slightly different spawn time as the
other mobs in the zone.  If/when you find it, keep popping that PH and
you'll spawn Quillmane quite regulary....it dropping the cloak..not so
regular.
