My basic rule is: if they don't ask for help, I don't help. I may pause to watch
as I wander by, if you are loosing HP faster than your mob, I will ask if you
want help. If you say no or don't answer, I will leave you and your target
alone. I may heal or buff, though, if I can and it looks like you need it.

Along with that, I have a hotkey on *all* of my characters: "Thanks, but I can
handle %t myself." with an extra, "A heal would be nice, if you have one." for
those cases where I'm not quite as confident as I might sound. Another hot key
does:

I could use a hand with %t!
/shout I've got %t and maybe more heading to <place>!
/loc

In other words, if I need help, I will ask. If I don't ask....
