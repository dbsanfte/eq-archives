There are two named in every dungeon and it looks like they always
drop either a rune or an item, sometimes both. Most of the loot is sub
par even for a non-raider like me but there are exceptions. See the
ring of corruption in my magelo. That one qualified as a definite
upgrade for me, even if it does only have 65hp.
