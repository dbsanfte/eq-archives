	The point is that you wouldn't.  You don't need a second one.  You don't
even NEED the one you have!

	We've had one bogus Druid in the guild and he's long gone.

	The simple inescapable truth is that:

	a) There is a maximum number of people you can bring to any event.  Too
many people means too much lag, too many complications.  (LD's, people getting
lost, invis dropping, etc.)

	b) There is also a minimum number of people needed for any event.

	c) Lots of encounters in the endgame push these two numbers real close
together -- meaning every player-space counts.

	d) When you reach that point you will stop taking classes that are
second-best at what they do (or worse) because you can't afford to take them
any more.

	e) Most of the classes in this game (including Druids and all four
hybrids) fall into that catagory.

	Now if you want to play such a class for personal reasons, knock yourself
out.  I did.  But I'm not going to lie to anyone *including myself* about my
utility in the endgame.
