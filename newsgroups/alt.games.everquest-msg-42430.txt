> You get what you pay for.

you sure? :)
Rumours are (and stress RUMOURS) that DAOC is going to cost more than EQ
does per month, but will they see a better level of customer service than
what EQ / UO provide? I seriously doubt that.

I know your werent referring to just customer service, but the "whole gaming
experience" but I thought I'd throw that in for some thought.
