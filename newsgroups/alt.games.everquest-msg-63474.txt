   Well, it should be pointed out that the offer was
a general one, made to all of Cox's internet customers
in the San Diego area (and presumably elsewhere) on
its website. 
 But still... we're talking about customers that 
shell out a nice chunk of change for highspeed 
access.  We're certainly not doing this
because we are casual dabblers on the internet.
How long would ten hours of slow dial-up service
last the typical person that pays upwards of $50 
a month for highspeed? (I don't know the exact 
amount I pay for the connection, since it is lumped
with my digital cable tv bill. Together, they come
to just over $100 a month).
   Oh, I don't spend quite 350 hours on the net
a month.  More like 150-200, give or take a dozen.
But this only because I have a full time job.
