Wow... when was the last time you were in CT?  =)

It's definitely a 58+ zone.  Every time I go there, it's almost exclusively
60's working on AAXP.  It's the only place I've gone where the zone-in is
one of the best XP places in the zone - although you don't get those cool
drops.

But 52... um, no.  After they revamped CT, I went in with three groups of
50-56 folks in a mini-raid.  The zone-in mobs wiped us.  Three times.  I
didn't go back until after I'd dinged 60.

But, hands down, CT is *the* best XP place outside of an AE group.
