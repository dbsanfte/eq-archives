Log an alt, or use Eqim to reach a friend. (some ppl can log alts despite
1018) And petition (or let them petition for you, that your character needs
a worldkick. Bazaar has nasty feature when zoning for some ppl and makes
databae with activve chars corrupt flagging yours active. After petition
have a lot of patience, cause it'll take some time before it is handled by
GM's. :-(

If you can't play on any normal server due to 1018 take testserver to enjoy
the quiet atmosphere over there.
