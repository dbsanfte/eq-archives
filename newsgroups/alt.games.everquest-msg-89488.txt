I've check the monkly business but didn't find too much info on this
spawn.

Is him a rare spawn?
Any PH for him?
How many ppl will it take to down him?
Does every spawn of him drop the pipe?

I hope he is not as rare as Raster because unlike Raster I cant take him
down all on myself.

Any info appreciated!!
