Actually it is level 6 now since they seem to have added the no attack under
level 5 to the server since the last time I played there.

Current news as of last night and some this morning. I think since this is
an EQ newsgroup people won't mind me reporting the "EQ PvP Experience".

That didn't stop idiots from trying anyway. They had a high level character
casting harmony on the guards and were training undead to pick up people
that were hidden/camou.

As far as being attacked, went from misty thicket to Surefall to Blackburrow
to Qeynos w/o incident. I pretty much only get attacked when I am looking
for it.

That being said, four level 6 halfling social retards were camping Misty
Thicket [helc, belc, ...]. They had a lap dog giving them major buffs
completely beyond their level. Str, hitpoints, damage shields, see invis,
etc.

Pretty much killing everyone low on life fighting mobs. They were evey using
an exploit, removing a HP ring when they got in trouble to prevent people
from getting a kill on them and looting rights. They bragged about this in
/shout. Heh, lucky I am not a GM or they wouldn't be able to see the login
server even with see invisible up. Corpse camping etcetera everything normal
people think is lame.

Their buff monkey finally took off, I waited for about 20 minutes until I
was sure their buffs ran out, then camou'd and started hunting them. Sure as
shit, soon as I put a spell on one he ran to the guards screaming like a
little girl. Sometimes I really love doing PvP but it is almost impossible
to get someone to PvP when they run like this. Most of the people I have
seen claiming they were PvP were really timid like this when it came right
down to it.

This is not PvP. If it was about PvP, he would have fought, it is cheapshot.
There were maybe 10 players there bitching about these morons, me hunting
them. One player complained that had followed him for hours attacking
because he had refused to join their guild: Real mature crowd. I make this:
Out of 15 players<buff monkey left> there were 4 assholes enjoying
themselves exploiting game mechanics, me<arguably an asshole in my own
right> having a decent time hunting them, and 10 disatisfied customers who
think the PvP servers really suck goat balls. I think they have a point.

Now understand I do like a good fight against a worthy opponent. These
morons could provide neither. See? That is what PvP is about, good fight,
good opponet. There is very little PvP that takes place in any MMO.

Let me give you a little analogy. Say Mike Tyson is still heavyweight
champion and he is in a dentist chair having root canal work done. Now I
walk up behind him and smack him with a baseball bat. Does that constitute
PvP and mean I am now the Heavyweight Champion? No! Of course not. It has
nothing to do with PvP or a contest, it is just a cheapshot.

So I am down on pp anyway, I go into town and jump into the water to pick
off a few piranha for some easy loot. Sure enough someone has already camped
them, so I start swiming away and I get hit from behind with some low level
spell from "Express" another moron. I have kind of a cool head, I figure
since he had been fighting the piranha and hit me with a low level spell, he
must be oom. So I KS/blast the two piranah, pick up some of the fat loot
type teeth while he sits around watching me do it because he wasted his mana
on me. Don't tell me cheapshot artist are smart, they are compulsive.
Cutting off your nose to spite your face is not a smart move.

Actually I kind of liked the solitude of the PvP server. The biggest zone I
was in, NK I think, only had 12 other people. Blackburrow had 2 others,
Queynos Aqueducts had 0.0 if you don't count me.

Annoying number of abandoned corpses everywhere. Same proportion of beggers
"ne1 have a fine steel wepon they can give me?", "ne1 want to buff me?", ad
nauseum. The good thing about it is with only 3 people in a zone, one of
them being me, I only have to put 2 people on ignore to enjoy myself.

If you knew how to level in real life I may.

As it is, leveling in this game means nothing. I even picked up another
level this morning just screwing around while taking a look at conditions.
The game is just a silly diversion, something I do with my spare time.
Trying to imply there is more significance to it then that is just being
shallow.
