The gargoyles on the haunted island in Ocean of Tears will give great xp
at 20, and continue to do so through 24, though a bit slower then. They
*can* be done at 18, though it's a close fight. Twenty is a great level
for that, pet classes can solo them, and you can make some GREAT cash!
(Gargoyle eyes are tiny, they stack, and vendors pay around nine plat
each for them, so a stack sells really well.) Sort of a semi-rare drop,
but I've gotten as much as a stack, or as little as two in a three or
four hour session.

My necro solo'd there from 18 to 24. I've seen mages doing it too, so
you should have no trouble.
