Problem is... Going to Lake of Ill Omen, as a 11 and 10...  Would make you
bait for anything.  You can technically milk Crushbone til you are 18 or
19, then move to Oasis of Marr.  Unfortunately, Crushbone is one of the
more well known stupid factor Dungeons, where people do stupid things like
training from the Tower or the Throne Room and sharing it with the rest of
the zone.  Oasis of Marr is similar to Lake of Ill Omen, where it is a
magnet for people who want to level, and also for the level of stupidity
when it comes to Spectres or Sand Giants and sometimes Orcs in general.
Chessboard in the nearby zone of Butcherblock is one place to try, but I
would wait til your Druid is 14th level before venturing beyond
Gfay/Crushbone/Butcherblock, even with the soulbinders in Freeport and
Fironia Vie.  The headaches for getting LoIO from  Butcher is bad enough
and the headaches in Oasis a little less so.
