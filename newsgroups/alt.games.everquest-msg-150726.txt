Yeah, that's the general idea.

Wizard:

aggro mob;
unsnared mobs chase wizard;
run in circles until together;
snare
if resist, run a bit more, snare those that resisted;
run in circles until together again;
nuke until dead, refreshing snare as needed.

Druid:

snare mob to aggro.  If resisted, run a bit, reapply;
snared mobs chase druid;
run in cirles until together;
nuke until dead.

There's a major difference in safety factor between having
to snare mobs as a group and snaring them individually.
And, if the wizard chooses to snare individually, he's got
to worry about snare dropping constantly while he's rounding
up the quad AND during the quad as well.  Druids don't have
that worry.

Druids have a safer time quadding, at least while they learn
how to do it.
