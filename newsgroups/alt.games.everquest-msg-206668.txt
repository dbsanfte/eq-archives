Ah, the cost of haste.  Here's a way; use Alacrity on your group's MA, and a
cheaper haste on everyone else (if in a melee heavy group).  Yes, twice the
spell memming, but it'll help your MA keep aggro.

I prefer charming with my bard, too.   Consider that if the mob is about to
EAT the cleric and your melee can't get it off, a charm WILL get the mob
under control.  Charm is oddly hard to resist, too; I've had luck Charming
mobs that I couldn't mezz.  And consider Charm as a CC option for things
like giants, who cannot be mezzed (flagged immune).  If you have time, Tash
the mobs before you attempt to charm them.  Charm breaks when the mob makes
a successful save vs. magic; Tash will extend how long a charm will last.
Lastly, if you get an overpull and your group is melee-light, consider using
a charmed mob to offtank an add; this takes two mobs out of circulation at
least temporarily.

Enchanter nukes are high-aggro because of the 0-second stun built into most
of them (including this one).  This also means they frequently can stop a
mob from casting.  Use your level 8 nuke instead, though; it's cheaper,
faster-casting, and works just fine to stop those mob heals.

Sorry, won't make you non-KOS to undead.  Eye candy only.

Right now, continue using Languid Pace.  Tepid Deeds will come into it's own
in a few more levels, when the percentage slow goes up and your mana
pool/regen increases.  I started using it regularly around 29, when I got
Clarity.

Useful primarily for when you're loaded down with loot and on the way to
sell off.

Rune II is very situational, but that 118 point speedbump can help.
Consider this spell is from the Old World era, when a fifty-hitter was
considered nasty.  These days, it's less important, but if you're dealing
with mobs that like to pogo it can help.  Also, consider that you're FAR
less likely to get interrupted when you're runed - did you know getting hit
won't make you stand until the rune fades? - so drop a rune on yourself if
you're about to try and use PBAOE stuns.

Sagar's will bash to stun/interrupt.  The gnoll  hide lariat is a good
option.

Wait until you're fighting something that casts a damage shield on itself,
like Drachnids; or a shaman mob that hastes and SoWs itself.  Strip
Enchantment is gold.  I'm not sure why you think Strip works on not as many
types; both Cancel and Strip will only remove magic-based buffs.  Cancel
will try to remove the highest / first buff a mob casts on itself; Strip
tries to remove the first two (each must save separately).  Tash the mob
before trying to Cancel or Strip and you'll have better luck.

As in all things chanterly, these spells are situational.  Remember that
your FIRST duty is crowd control, your second duty is buffing, third is
debuffing.  In your range, my typical day-to-day lineup would be
1 Tash
2 Stun
3 Stun
4 Buffslot
5 Root
6 Charm
7 Mezz
8 Gate or debuffslot (depends on how much you trust your group)
