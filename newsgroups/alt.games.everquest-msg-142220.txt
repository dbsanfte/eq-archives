I have looted several Words of Dissolutionment but no Words of Dissolution.
The Casters Realm research list for necros' lists the words Dissolution,
Seizure and Descrying for the 39th level spell Nullify Magic.  Since I had
never seen the word Dissolution and because I saw NO spells listed using the
word Dissolutionment, I assumed that it was an error.  However when I tried
combining Dissolusionment in place of Dissolution in the above spell I got
the message "these items cannot be combined in this type of container".

Does that mean that somewhere out there are Words of Dissolution? and if so,
what are Words of Dissolutionment for?
