For a while (on my server), the undead were active...including the tainted
brownies (ouch).  Then they went away and reverted to the original LFay.
Then a week later the undead came back.  I am not sure if this is the trend
for every server but regardless, when LFay was undead, he was in the middle
of the faerie camp and Gearheart(sp?) was his ph if I remember correctly.
