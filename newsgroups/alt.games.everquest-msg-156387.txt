Yup I have that problem too, glad it's not just me.  I went through
all my character's items and entered them, put in all my stats and
stuff, so I could see at a glance what focus effects I needed to
upgrade, and how much my stats were affected by what I was wearing.

Loading.... loading..... loading.... loading.... blank page.
Huh.  Refresh.
Loading... loading... you get the idea?
Shift+Refresh.
Nothing.
Close IE. Delete internet files.  Clear cache.  Clear history.  Open
IE.
Nothing.
Try new browser.
Nothing.
Screw it.

I opened it the next day and my char screen would load again, but only
half the items had ever made it in, and none of my stats were listed
>< Back onto EQ, strip stuff into bank again, write down stuff, back
to Ally's.  Relist.

Loading... loading... loading...
