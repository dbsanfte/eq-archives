    It disrupts the normal function of that NPC with no gain to the person
doing it. If there's no way for an arbitrary person to gain access to the
function without leaving the zone, it's zone disruption.

    On Quellious, the GMs will go postal on anyone caught chain-killing a
banker. This is different from, say, killing Shady in EC. There's other
vendors in EC, there usually isn't another banker (or if there is, the
morons are killing all of them). Even bankers in "XP" cities like Thurg and
Kael are covered by this rule of thumb.

    The banker won't aggro on you unless you attack him, and he poofs when
killed (so all you get is faction). It's usually pretty hard to claim that
you were killing him for a "good" reason, and when the petitioner reveals
that he tried to get you to stop long enough for him to bank and you
wouldn't....
