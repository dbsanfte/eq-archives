Best way to Power Level as a Druid
1 Buff Str, Skin, Regen, Wolf Form, and Damage Shield
2 he only needs to do 1 point of damage if the DS kills the mob so keep him
alive and let the mobs beat them selves to death.
3 At level 8 take him to Kerra Island (20% Exp bonus) go down to the Pier
and you agro the Catfisher and let it fight you but do not kill it. As long
as he is close to you and the Catfisher the mobs will kill themselves on the
DS without trying to run.
4 Have him pull mobs till the cows come home. This will take him to the 20s
after exp runs dry head to Sol A, Dalnair.
