Thats not a problem. Im from Denmark myself, dont got any problems on a 
384/128 DLS line.

Probably gonna be hard to find the original pack, you should probably go 
for the one with Kunark and Scars of Velious in it too. If you should 
manage to find the original one, and find you like the game, youll have 
to buy at original/kunark/velious one anyway, because you cant find 
those 2 expansions sold seperately any more.

Yes, if you plan on a PvP server. Then you can be killed by other 
players. If you play on a normal server, there are only a few ways you 
can be killed by players:

Give a book you get to the nearby Priest of Discord, then you will 
become PvP. You can now fight PvP agains the 10 or so other players on 
the server stupid enough to have done that.

Duel people. If you duel you as the name say can kill the other person 
you duel.

PvP areas. There are areas in most cities, and a big arena that are PvP 
areas, where everyone can kill each other. Guilds often have great fun 
doing a Arena event :)

Guild war. If youre a member of a guild that do guild wars, you can kill 
the members of the guild youre at war with as long as the guild war last.

Level 1-6 you go back to bind spot (your respawn spot, can be changed by 
players (casters can bind people in city areas, can bind themself 
anywhere, when they get the spell bind) or the new soulbinders you can 
meet in cities.
At level 1-6 you get your starting food back, and dont loose any XP. You 
need to get back to loot your corpse to get whatever gear and stuff you 
had on it back.

Level 7-60 you loose some XP (usually 3 blue bubbles, depend on level), 
and get back to bind spot. Need to loot your corpse to get stuff back.
