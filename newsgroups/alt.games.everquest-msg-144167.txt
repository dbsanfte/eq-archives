There is a big difference between charging your friend money for it, and
accepting money he freely offers for it.  I am perpetually broke.  I have
been given a lot of equipment and spells, I have no clue even what it's
value is.  If I loot an item I don't need, I ask my friends if any of them
need it.  If it's a spell that none of my friends need, I donate it to the
guild bank.  If it's droppable equipment that none of my friends can use, I
sell it.  I have given away a lot of equipment and spells, and I don't have
any clue what it might be worth.  Cash loot, I sell.  Sure, my friends can
use the cash, but, so can I.  I also don't expect them to give me cash.  I
have loaned friends money, and they have loaned me money.  That 20k is far
more money than I have ever had as well, and it would go a long way towards
my tradeskill training, but, I would still give the spell away.  I guess
that's why I am perpetually broke, well, that and doing tradeskills.

Perhaps I overreacted in my initial statement, all I can say, is that is not
the way I do things.
