Which is exactly what your stance has been :D  What an idiot you
are... YOU have been arguing that the word had only one meaning!  WE
all KNOW that word has several meanings... but we also know they all
descend from the same root word.  You are so poorly educated (as
witness the way you cannot spell basic words like fallacy, effeminate
and feral) that this last fact will forever be beyond your limited
understanding.
