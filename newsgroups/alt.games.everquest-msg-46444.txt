I like the low delay myself.  I will always remember fondly getting this
comment while in a pick-up group in CC back at level 36...

a_twinked_tank_01 says to you, "ORLUN, What the Hell weapons delay do you
have? 17?!!!"

Got a good laugh out of that...

Correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't the SCH a stamina killer?  I seem to
remember reading that and seeing it myself from the little I got to use the
one I had.
