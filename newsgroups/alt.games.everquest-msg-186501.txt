Brilliant idea.  I've already run across "true newbies" who have trouble 
getting a group because they can't keep up equipment-wise.  I talked to 
a warrior who was frustrated because they were asked to join a group, 
and when they got there, they found out they couldn't tank against what 
the group was fighting, because they were wearing a mix of tattered and 
whatever else they'd managed to loot or buy.

Instituting something that widened the gap even more would be insanely 
bad.  "We're gonna run to PC now - oh what's that, you have to take the 
long way?  Okay well, we'll probably be done by then, so we'll just find 
someone to take your place who *can* go."

Now, pure quest-based, I wouldn't have a problem with - run from 
Freeport to Neriak, touch the book, and you can now port from Freeport 
to Neriak books.  Etc etc.  The flagging idea is a much better idea.
