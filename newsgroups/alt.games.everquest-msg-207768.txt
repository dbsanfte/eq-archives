If it helps, I'll point out that Everquest has *saved* me money.

Like many folks who enjoy computer games, I used to buy a new game
every 3-8 weeks, after I'd tired of the previous one.

Well, I've been playing Everquest for three years straight now,
and have been enjoying it enough that I haven't felt the need
to buy *any* other games.  That has saved me quite a few $50
purchases.

Furthermore, I don't even spend as much money on other entertainment
items, including movies and restaurants as I used to.  I still do
those things when I'm truly in the mood for them, but I've cut out
going to the second-rate movies which I used to see due to nothing
else to do, and likewise for the times I'd have gone out to eat just
for a change of scenery.  Now when I'm feeling adventurous I
check out a new dungeon, stay home, and in the process spend
less money on mediocre movies and unnecessary restaurant food.

The "bad" thing about Everquest is you can only play it online,
and that requires a minor monthly subscription fee (to pay for
the resources you're using on the shared servers when you play).
The *good* news is that because it's online instead of "local",
you're constantly interacting with *hundreds* of other players,
which makes for an incredibly rich gaming experience, much more
complex and interactive than any standalone game could ever
possibly be.  Plus, if you're like most Everquest players,
you'll start hanging out with a close-knit bunch of regular
players, and form some real long-term friendships, plus
enjoy the thrill of team play that turns your fighting
squad into a real smoothly operating machine as you
learn to coordinate skillfully by playing/fighting together 
often.
