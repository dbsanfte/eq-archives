Hold the phone here. Can this be confirmed? 7 Mana per INT point past
200? Is this at *any* level, or just after fifty?  Becasue my wizzie is
only 40, but I'm already over two hundred INT. So if I want to give up a
+3 INT slot item, I'll need to come up with at least a +22 Mana item to
replace it and see a gain? Is this a straight formula, or am I going to
get fucked on some kind of curve?
