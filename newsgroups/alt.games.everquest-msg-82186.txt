I didn't write "potential life."  I wrote potential human.
My big toe is alive, and can be kept alive even when
removed from my body.  It is not, however, a human
being.  

"Distinct" DNA, in the sense you mean it, does not
convey humanity.  Twins have, in the sense you
mean it, essentially the same DNA, but are different humans.

As an aside, the assumption that *you* are homogeneous
in your DNA is wrong.  Does that mean that you
are, in fact, many people?

Oddly enough, not all the cells in my (our your) body 
have the same DNA.  Some cells in our bodies are
characterized by having hypervariable DNA -- it's
the way cells that make antibodies manage to react
to new diseases, by changing their DNA at a very
fast rate.  Other cells in my body have mutated at
the "normal" rate, and others have been mutated
at a higher rate by exposure to toxins and other
 environmental events.  Other cells have incorporated
DNA from external sources, such as lysogenic viruses.  

So, any absolutist DNA-based argument for humanity
is pretty weak -- I can produce cells and tissues
with "human" DNA that are not "humans,"  I can 
produce two different humans with essentially the
same DNA, and I can demonstrate many distinct 
DNA variants in a single human.
