The best way to do ports, as someone else has mentioned in this thread, is
to do them from a zone that has high level characters in it.  If you do
ports from Butcher Block or West Commons, you're lucky to get 20pp for the
port.  Bind yourself in The Overthere (29 is just the right level to start
playing in The Overthere), and just start playing.  You will see people
shouting for ports and offering 40, 50, 100pp even.  One poor sole the other
day needed a port so bad he offered 200pp.  I left my group briefly to port
him and he gave me 225.

One other thing.  When you are auctioning ports, don't name a price.  Just
say you are doing them for 'donations'.  If you offer them for donations,
people tend to pay what they can afford.  Granted, you will occasionally do
a free one, but most characters, especially on more mature servers can
afford to casually throw around quite a bit of plat and they usually do.

Best Regards
