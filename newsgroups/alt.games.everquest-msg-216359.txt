Hi all,

Having a drogmor is great. I mean REALLY great. I bought the cheap ass 
one(white, to match my black and white Froggy cleric), but the casting 
benefits are insane. No more sit aggro. No more "Oops forgot to sit after 
casting". None of that whatsoever. My only problem is spellcasting 
interuption. I asked in serverwide.clerics and the unilateral answer is 
"Click off the drog then duck"

I am really really hoping there is some better way to do this- anyone know 
of one?
