No, just because a card is not fast enough to be used for something does not
mean that it will not function. Bad frame rates does not equate to
non-functionality, only non-usability.

If a game requires what has been lauded as the most powerful consumer (the
GeForce2 MX400 is a consumer video card, not to be confused with a real gaming
card) video card to be merely usable, perhaps they need to work on their
code/ambitions.
