From what I can remember from playing my 43 bard on Cazic Thule, the
last time I was hunting in EW, I got rooted by a snow griffin. I tried
stopping and starting Selos a few times, but still didn't get unstuck.
Looking forward to testing this out tonight to see if it's any
different on RZ.

Now that you mention it, I can see why these effects were taken away
from PvP. Oh well, this just gives me an opportunity to become a
little more creative when fighting someone.

I think I've come to terms with that now. After a few more nights,
I've been PK'ed two more times, once out of nowhere as I zoned into
Butcherblock, and once while occupied by some orcs guarding Crushbone.
Haven't been looted yet however (Patchwork and newbie armor), but I'm
sure that will change once I get better equippment.

I wasn't completely sure about the looting of money, but just in case,
I've been schooling myself to bank it whenever I go back into town to
sell.

I'm currently working on this by offering whatever help I can to
questions asked in /ooc or /shout, and by generally building my
reputation as not being an asshole =)

After playing on this server for about a week, I currently have no
plans to leave. I had been thinking about uninstalling EQ after
playing for 3 years because I was getting bored with it. As a college
student on a tight budget, I do not have much money with which to
upgrade my computer to the point where I can even think about playing
with Luclin or PoP, so I haven't seen any new content in a long while.
I think PvP is just the thing to get me to enjoy the game again.
