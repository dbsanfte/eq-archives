The thing is, if I name my character Sexmesexme, then I know I'm going
against the policy.  If I name my character Nekoyasha (Japanese for
cat-witch, my kitty shaman), I am not.  If I violate the policy, then it's
my own fault.  If Verant decides that I don't have the right to name my own
characters, even if I'm well within the naming policy, then that's not so
good.  If verant decides to change my characters' names, even though they're
legitimate, then we've got issues.

As far as changing people's names IRL, I believe children should be able to
sue their parents for malfeasance.
