No, I have seen you use the word "technically" twice now.  Barring SOE
coming out and saying that they did not intend for Fishing to be a
tradeskill, I would not rule it as not being one, whether "technically" or
otherwise.  Just because it is not identical in all ways to other
tradeskills does not make it not a tradeskill, "technically" or otherwise.
If I search hard enough, I'm sure I could come up with examples of how other
tradeskills are different too.
