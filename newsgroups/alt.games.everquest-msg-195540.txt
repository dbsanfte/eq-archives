If you have room you can pull with DoT, spinning as you cast, run
while gems refresh, spin and cast Root which if mob is not fast
should land before mob reaches melee range, cast Slow, the poison
DoT, then wade in (poison DoT will wear off just before Slow does
making a nice timer).  I usually don't try to get this cute, going
diseaseDoT/slow/poisonDot/tank and only use root to rot or to get
the mob to beat on some convenient tank who's standing closer.

I am become the Woody Hayes of FoL casters, there are too many things
that can happen when you Flash a mob and only one of them is good.

Having partnered a non-snarer with an SK quite a few times over the
years, I can assure you that the answer to that is:  Yes!
Having said that, my Inny Troll Shaman is only halfway thru the second
of the three quests.
