That comment is utter nonsense.
You don't have to be heavily twinked to grind out exp.  It only takes
a decent understanding of the game mechanics, which almost universally
I find people do not understand at all.

To level 55?  About 40 days on average.
Some faster some slower.  But overall, 40 days /played is what it took
them.  That's going from level 1 to level 55.

That's really misleading.
Most of the pieces dropping in Fear/Hate are junk.  They were junk
before Kunark, they are worse than junk after Velious.

Have you actually seen the stats of some of the pieces?  There's
usually only about 3 pieces which are "planar" calibre.  The rest are
weak.  Typically it's BP/Legs and one other piece.

It's being done RIGHT NOW!
My guild cannot add any more people under level 59, so we formed a
"junior varsity" guild for lower level folks to use as a way to level
up and get some actual experience in raiding.

The raid leaders of this junior guild are long time members of our
guild so there's some practical knowledge being passed down, but
beyond that it's nothing more than folks between 45 to 55 getting
together to do things.  Typically this is farming Kael Arena for armor
drops.

You can go from DEEP KOS to Tormax/Kromzek/Kromrifs to allied in
matter of days.  

Our guild is currently giant factioned.  We hunt in ToV West and kinda
use dorfs as footballs.

The junior varsity guild is Dorf/Dragon allied.  They hunt in Kael.
Those members that "graduate" spend about 3 days with our normal
raiding groups to become warmly or higher to Kromzeks and the same
with Kromrifs (dorf punting is good buffer exp).

The ONLY faction they would have difficulty raising is Tormax.  But
since we also hunt Icewell royals during our buffer exp times, they
can raise that faction very quickly as well.

And of course, if they come to our Yelinak raids, one Yelinak kill is
about 3 faction levels with Tormax.

Faction in Velious is a joke.  And I mean REALLY a joke.
I've had newly recruited people swing from "your standing with
Kromzeks cannot possibly get any worse" to "regards you as an ally" in
matter of days.

Kael Arena.
They can do that place.  They can do it with less people than Fear
*AND* get better overall drop rates.
