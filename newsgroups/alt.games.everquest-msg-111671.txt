The problem is that you are thinking of it as upgrading, instead, think of
it as a new game.  Games come, games go, evenutally, EQ will most likely
shutdown, regardless of whether or not EQ2 is ever released.  Other
companies will release newer, and likely better games than EQ, and if Verant
does not offer something new to attract customers, eventually, they will not
have any.
