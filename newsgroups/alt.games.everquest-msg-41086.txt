I agree, DT is merely posting his oppinions and it has been a good debate.
With the exception of being called a monster, semi-directly, there has been
no name calling and it has been in context with the debate.

Agreed, nothing good will come of this for quite some time, if at all.
Noone wants to lose lives, but it looks like we are headed down that path,
unfortunately.  I rather enjoy my job when I can work up to what we never
expect to happen  I take no happiness in knowing that what we prentend may
happen some day while we are training may actually come to pass.  I take no
joy in knowing people that I know and serve with will die nor that many
innocents will die.  All i hope for is a resolution to the situation, not a
legacy likend to what we have in Iraq.
