> $20-$50 on ebay the other day when I checked....

  For the Windows 98 to Windows 98 SE "update cds", that is the price
you will usually find on eBay.  For full versions of Windows 98, or
Windows 95 to 98 upgrade cds, you usually pay at least $50, even on
eBay.  I did a search on completed auctions before making my purchase
to check the price and most of them ended in the $70 range, plus
shipping.

  You're probably right about people not getting more than their
original purchase price out of any settlement, but that doesn't mean
that somebody might make an attempt, or try to get some sort of
criminal charges brought up against Verant.  Even if unsucessful, the
lawyering would end up costing Verant a bit.  This way, they can offer
a refund that virtually nobody will take them up on, thus they are
completely immunized from legal action, without having to worry about
many people trying to cash in on their refund.

  We're talking OS here, not processors.  Also, the screenshots you
mention are presumably those for the Shadows of Luclin expansion,
which not everybody purchased.  Knowing my PC is aging I didn't bother
to buy it, but I thought that I might be able continue to be able to
play in old zones with old models/textures without much trouble.

  Yes, this is what I was referring to... Windows 95, not the other
upgraded requirements.  As for why somebody would want to use Win95
over 98... there are few reasons... the primary one being that some of
us would prefer not spending $90 on an upgrade unless it's absolutely
necessary.  Though I am irked at having had to spend the money, I
understand the necessity of it, but still think we should have been
given at least a week or two of warning.  Instead, we were assured up
until the day before the patch that DX8.0a (and by extension, Win95)
would be the new requirement.

  I'm sure any lawyer could afford it, but it's still possible that a
lawyer, incensed over the poor customer service offered by Verant,
would "take up the cause" for his fellow players, especially at the
prospect possibly cashing in personally on the episode (win or lose).
An off chance, perhaps, but it costs Verant nothing to guard against
it.
