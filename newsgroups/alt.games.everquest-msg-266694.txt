Uh... well there are a number of biological entities and processes that 
there is little evidence that they evolved, that essentially need to 
spontaneously come to exist because they wouldn't be much use until they 
worked, and until they worked they provided no benefit to the process so 
there would be no natural selection for them. (Some sort of cellular 
level cilia is a specific example if i recall correctly)

Other examples involve the apparent rapidity of some evolution changes, 
seeming to defy natural selection.

It doesn't disprove evolution in favour of say, creationism, but there 
are certainly some holes in evolution that need filling. I expect the 
theory of evolution will itself evolve, not simply be replaced and 
discarded. :)
