Of course you can do something about it! Have a friendly
theurgist/warden/runemaster cast a bladeturn on you. Move with the
terrain. Join a group with scouts and outriders. Have a friendly rogue
class on anti-stealth patrol. Soon as an attack comes use tactics. If
your outnumbered split and run. If not stay and fight. 

If you got instakilled by an archer then well that was a bug. It's
been fixed. If you go to the Frontier at level 15 you should expect to
get owned by level 40's. Of course you will. My main char is level 20.
If I go to the frontier I will get owned 90% of the time and I know
it. So what, I level and come back and so does everyone else and one
day in a few months the average player will be in his 30's and 40's
and it will no longer be a one sided fight.
