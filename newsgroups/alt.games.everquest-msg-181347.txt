I know what you mean.  One of the best times I had was in the Throne Room in
Crushbone.  A little dwarf would shout "Crushbone resistance is now
recruiting!" We got a full group of 15-18 level peeps and we owned the TR
for several hours. I guess it's just fun to kill orcs.

Oh there was the time I partnered my necro with a monk in Paludal and just
the two of us pulled and killed non-stop.  It was amazing.

Then there was the time I explored OOT with my shaman and I came across and
little gnome on the siren isle out in the middle of nowhere.  We roleplayed
the whole meeting and it really felt like some great adventure far from
home.
