    Blart, the PvP player that created Fansy, is simply awesome. He pokes
fun at the "I r0xxor, u r teh suck!" attitude of a lot of PvP players by
killing them, then acting friendly and clueless (which makes them even
angrier). When he first heard about Sullon Zek, he knew it would attract all
the worst of the EQ PvP world because it had no rules on player conduct
(compared with the other Zeks). He also knew all these so-called "l33t PvP
playahs" would flock to the teams that were set up from the get-go to be the
most powerful, Evil and Neutral. So he made a good bard and had at them,
using every rules loophole and EQ glitch to slaughter them.

    When he trained everyone with his bard, he was so good at it that SZ had
to have new rules on when players could be attacked just to combat what he
was doing. The charm assist bug is one that has impact in both PvP and
non-PvP - bards have used charm assist to almost solo-clear all the dragons
in Western Wastes, and PvP charmers have used it to get players summoned and
killed in Western Wastes by dragons that otherwise would never attack them.
I really, truly hope his exploits in Rivervale convince VI that fixing this
particular quirk of the faction system is an A-1 priority.

    And that applesauce comment is priceless. Some of our guild members have
already used "AFK: giving grandpa more applesauce" messages. =)
