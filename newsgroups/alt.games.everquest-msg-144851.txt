}Stuff from CT can't be equipped before the recommended
}level.  Other items simply lose a significant portion
}of their stats when equipped below the recommended level.

Hmm... I'm pretty sure I equipped some cheezy knife I got from CT on my 18 
rogue, and it had the recommended level stats, but equipped anyway.  Dunno 
why they bothered, it was barely better than a FS dagger even with full 
stats.  

But I guess the point is:  try it and let us all know!  I might want those 
booties for some of my caster twinks, when I'm independently wealthy.
