I see you're still obsessed with the idea that winning or losing a
duel in-game has jack shit to do with an argument on Usenet. You can
beat people down all you want in-game, it's not gonna change a damn
thing here.

By the way, you're so anxious to get us to come to YOUR server, where
you likely have at least one high level character and I doubt anyone
you're "calling out" has any characters there (meaning you'll be
dueling a lowbie)... Why not come to Tunare where *I* have two
high(ish) level characters? Oh, damn, I guess that would spoil your
ego trip. Take your toys and go home, boy. You're not wanted here.
