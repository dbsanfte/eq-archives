    Look at a SK's spell list sometime, post-50. How much of it do you
suppose they'd trade you for Stonestance?

    MGB is good. Crit Heals are the cleric equivalent of Finishing Blow -
nice if it goes off, but you'd never rely on it. Longer buff durations is
near-worthless - you renew AoE Aego before each new boss to catch the people
that just arrived anyways, and with the two and a half hour base duration
it's not like it fades often in the first place. Bestow DA is really one
more personal DA, since casting it on someone else usually leads to crazy,
uncontrolled aggro (and also doesn't always save the person you cast it on).
The mana free heal is a HoT, so again it's not saving someone, and to get it
you need 12 points in the +% to your heals skill (which is damned-near
useless to a cleric). And the GM res has WHAT refresh time again? =/

    Ambidexterity, Double Riposte, Return Kick. All class-level, all useful
when soloing (only Ambidexterity would help in a raid environment), all
above and beyond Combat Fury. And in terms of non-damage stuff, you get one
exceptional class-level skill like clerics and warriors do, Rapid Feign. I
also note that only one of your Class skills has a prerequisite, and the
prereq is something I bet most monks take anyways.

    The stab is always for 120 damage. If they did not have this skill they
would instead land a normal attack with their primary weapon. So a good
damage increase versus high mitigation mobs, but not so awesome as you'd
think.
