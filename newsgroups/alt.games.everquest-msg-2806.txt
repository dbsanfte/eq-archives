Keep your AE stun spell up (color flux).  Send off your AE mez, if some
resist, try it again.

If you get agroed and 1 or more start beating on you, ae stun, and then
single mez them.

I find enthrall is less reistable than your ae mez.

AE stun gets you out of most situations, and at very least gives you enough
time to root them or get a head start.

Also get your cleric to back you up.  Their stuns and roots will save your
life, and be sure to tell the tanks that if you die, they will probably die
too :)
