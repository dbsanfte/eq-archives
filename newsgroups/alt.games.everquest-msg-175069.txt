You have to kill Ixiblat before he despawns (if he does,
for that matter.)  He's a triggered spawn, so what you
actually did was have one cleric trigger the mob, wiped
out, reorganized, killed the previously triggered mob, and
then the next two clerics triggered him, with their mobs
being killed.  IIRC, the time between triggers is about two
hours (the turn-in mob despawns when Ixiblat is triggered.)
Again, IIRC, that's also somewhat dependent upon game
time as well.
