OK, if you remember back to the discussions on hybrids from way back
when, you will know about a concept called "multi-penalty".

Multi Penalty is the way that multiple inferiorities add up to become
much greater than any of the single parts.  E.g. Paladins defense had
lower Defensive caps *and* lower Defensive Skill Caps *and* lower Armour
Class items *and* few HP.  Each of these set at 10% to 25% below
warriors but adding them all together you get a Multi Penalty which made
Paladins not even half as good tanks as Warriors.

Well, eventually Verant either saw the light or fixed it through
ignorance but it went away to some extent allowing Paladins to tank at
about 80% of hte ability of Warriors.

But the Monk nerf re-introduces this concept and does so in a huge way.

Background.  Monks were good tanks from day 1.  Now we have a brand new
Development Team and instead of judging classes individually they are
using strict definitions "ooh its a plate class, its a chain class, they
have totank better than a leather class" despite the fact Monks take a
heavy penalty (in XP at one point and in weight limit) to tank *better*
than a leather class.

The worst problem of the change is that it was unnecessary to start
with.  With the new XP model and a change of mob design where there is a
more linear ATK value on mobs, the extra AC mitigation of Warriors and
Hybrid Plate classes was *already* giving them benefit.  But the nerf
went in anyway.  The entire mitigation bonus monks get for their weight
penalty was effectively removed.

This would be penalty enough on its own.  But it goes deeper when you
start to look at what is happening with PoP.

Monks always had a problem with doing decent damage.  If you weren't in
an uberguild you were still using Kunark era weapons (Epic or Tranq).
While all your warrior friends could upgrade weapons outside of
uberguild encounters in Velious and Luclin, monks were still stuick with
their Kunark crap.

And tihs continues in PoP.  Where is the 22/30 droppable 1hb?  Where is
the 2hb equivalent of the Windblade?  Where is ANY FUCKING UPGRADE
weapon for a monk outside of uberguild encounters!

And it isn't just weapons.  Look at the drops.  The mitigation nerf
monks have suffered is supposed to be attributed to high AC monk
wearable items.  But the nerf is across the board, where is the
attainable Monk items with higher AC?  They don't exist.  Worse there is
NOTHING for a monk amongst the attainable drops in PoP.  Every item
reeks of Multi Penalty - Developers going "can't put high AC on this"
but they already pre-nerfed the class to account for this!

It is hard to explain just how pointless the monk class is at the
moment.  Rangers suffered badly in Kunark.  But they still had Harmony
making them the best pullers in the game, they got archery and could
contribute fairly early and after two years they finally could be
considered balanced.  But what for Monks?  Do they need to wait two
years until a new Development Team realises just how stupid and
imbalanced the current design is?

Verant really do some of the stupidest things in game design.  After
four years one would think they might be starting to get out the cycle
of over-nerf and over-compensate.  But no, they seem to still wotk
without design documents and new development teams come in and
completely change the game mechanic.

I sitll play EQ for the company of my friends and will till we move on
to another game en masse.  But one thing I know for sure, it won't be
any game with the inept and farcical development strategies of Verant
Interactive.
