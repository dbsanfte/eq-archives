No that sounds like they are running as far as possible away from you, but are
limited by the small zone size.  Unfortunatly Verant has made their mobs run on
a particular vector when feared/dieing thus they may not necessarily be as far
as possible from you.

This is not a good idea to let happen in a lot of zones.  I'm a shaman and my
pet sucks, I often just let my pet go and finish it off, I've lost many corpses
due to them falling through the wall.
