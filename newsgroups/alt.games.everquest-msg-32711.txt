It's total bullshit.
No NPC mob will ever use illusion form.  Don't know why, but enchanter
dragons (Silverwing), shaman dragons (Hoshkar), druid dragons
(Whoashit), etc...never assume any illusion form.  Probably it's
because they lose some serious advantages going from dragon form to
any other form.

Usually it's because Wakening Land is soooooo laggy and soooooo filled
with trees, people *think* Whoashit was in treeform when it pops outta
nowhere to gank them.  It only takes on ignorant numbnut to spread
incorrect information before everyone accepts it as "The Truth".
