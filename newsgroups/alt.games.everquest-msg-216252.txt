Druid?  Necromancers make decent CC, but only necro, bard and chanter have mez;
relying on other forms of CC can be problematic.   Druid CC consists of root or
snare and kite, the latter is very tricky indoors, the former only a bit less
so, and both are vulnerable to caster mobs; even "pet mezzing" is usually a
better solution indoors than root sometimes.

Is there something about LDoN that makes those general comments not true?  I
have very little LDoN experience, but lots with druids, clerics, chanters,
bards, and necros...

Past 45, everyone in the group can have Aego or Virtue, under that everyone can
have Temperance, all these buffs last longer than any LDoN run.  This is one of
the central complaints of clerics; that one of the reasons we'd be desirable for
groups; for our massive HP buffs, are invalidated by the fact that anyone with
five minutes and two peridot in his pocket can have them for the run of the
mission.

Bards have Track.  Not great track, but if Druid track is good enough, bard
track probably is too; its exactly like druid track only with a slightly shorter
range assuming both have capped out their skill.

I'd hate to see any class being a "must have", but it would be possible to make
rogues important without that being necessary; just make the traps and locks
runnable by bards as well as by rogues; bards have the same skills but with caps
so low that currently there aren't many actual uses for them.  If bard level
find/remove and lockpick skills worked, you could make the various traps more
than an annoyance, which would mean every group would want one or the other.
You could also put some really nice stuff in the chests, which are currently a
waste of dungeon by and large, according to most people.

I wonder, though, if there's no drop stuff in those chests, if really the rogues
aren't going back in after the group breaks up and cleaning up on goodies with
no split...
