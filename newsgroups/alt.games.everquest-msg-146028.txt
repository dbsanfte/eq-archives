Dodge, Parry, and Riposte are not useless, but they're not all that
valuable either.  They simply don't fire off all that often.  This
patch pretty much obsoletes the Paladin, as far as I can tell.  Why
on earth would you want a character who has accepted a significant
reduction in tanking ability (lower ac, lower hp, crap for discs
compared to defensive) and a substantial reduction in damage output
(ca. 25%) in exchange for limited healing ability in your group,
when you can have <the absolute best by a huge margin healer> who
also outdamages the warrior while tanking nearly as well as the
Paladin when necessary?

It's absolutely mind-boggling.  This is the reward for enduring the
ever so slow correction of all of the stupid ways my class was
crippled lver the lasxt three years?  A few months of being reasonably
functional, and then, just as the player base begins to realize that
Paladins can actually pull their own weight we're rendered completely
obsolete by the stupidest f***ing change set VI has ever patched into
the game.

And on top of that, to add insult to injury, now that the ooburs
have all got their 100+ AA points on half-a-dozen chars each, they
put in an xp nerf that prevents anybody else from doing the same
and absolutely kills my ability to solo for (barely) acceptable xp.
