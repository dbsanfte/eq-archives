I had a similiar bug hit me.  I died in the zone I was exploring totally
unfairly.  I totally cannot recall even the dungeon, although it probably
isn't that hard to figure out since I haven't been to all that many.

This one was an icelike dungeon with like nothing around to kill me that was
equal to me in level really.  Was sort of trying to do specific things, and
was pissed when I died.  Did a /who GM and found GM who was showing himself.
Did a petition after giving him a tell about how I died.  I was pretty
upset.  Was not looking forward to the trek back to my body.  he helped a
little, after i ranted for quite awhile.  Then he asked me to give a report
to show I died with 10 K damage, like I fell.  I did the report, although
now I understand that the report only shows what your screen is showing.  If
you lose the message on your screen, you need to page up I believe before
doing the report.  I was like so pissed, I was like if report doesn't work I
can take a screen shot and send it to you.  Luckily got a GM rezz, and was
good to go, minus the 15 minutes running into some stupid bug that probably
still isn't fixed.  remember doing a bug fix about it, but I'm not
interested in coding right that second, I was interested in doing the
specific things I had at mind at that time.  The bug report I gave was along
the lines of got caught in *dungeon name on some < angle, where I went too
much into the point of the thing, got trapped (which happened and had to
send to a GM also, and petition in thurgadin dungeon), and was like not
kewl.  tried to work my way out myself, and ended up taking that stupid
falling damage.   : (

Had a cleric lose all his stuff to a bug boat problem, but was replaced
before I left him.  Which is kewl, but heard of another guy who got hit by
the bug, and didn't know about the 24 hours being online or 7 days offline
rule or something like that, and didn't bother to ask for any sort of help
for one reason or another.  Appearantly he lost all his stuff, the GM's
decided not to replace it.  He was like he lost approx 27 K plat in
equipment, which to him was a ton of plat    He was like he lost more plat
than any other single person on Bristlebane.

If your going to use the boats, please expect some delays and possibly put
away extra plat and items you don't wanna lose in the bank before hitting
it.   (although would make it harder to survive if you come across hostile
critters, running around neked, if you decided to put all your stuff in the
bank).

Another bug that pisses me off is my screen going black when i zone, where I
have to hit the I key to fix it.  appearantly I'm one of the few people who
use the 640 - 480 screen with the default keys, everyone else is either
transparency or full screen.  This always happened to me when i was zoning
into freeport or something else.  Maybe it was my Tnt 2 nvideo card or the
stupid 5.22 version I was stuck with running it. When I upgraded to the 6.
whatever I would always freeze when I tried to mem stuff.

I think this T & L - lighting problems I'm having currently is still another
problem with the driver - current version of EQ/lastest updated grahpic Tnt
version with SOL.  : (
Hoping my new computer with the Radean VE is trouble free.  everyone saying
Geoforce 2 or 3 is the only way to go is hopefully not going to be the only
thing supported.
