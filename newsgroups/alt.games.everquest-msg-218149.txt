The problem is, GM's don't have the tools to fix your problem. By
getting you to send email direct, they can try to build up enough of a
case that they need those tools so that the programmers will be
budgeted time to make them. Unless they can show a substantial volume
of complaints, no programmer time will be budgeted for fixing it
regardless of how much the GM's might love to fix the problem for you.
