Yes.  I like the diversity.  At least now I can go into a place like GFay or
Freeport and not see fifty people walking around with my exact same face and
outfit.  It feels a little more like I'm actually wandering around in a city
than in a cartoon.  I even like the elementals.  I'll go out of my way to
kill earth elementals just because they get me tickled when they priss off.
They're not terribly impressive, but definitely cute. -)  Personally I'm not
too crazy about the Barbarian females but love the new look of the Ogres.
They look much tougher now.  Overall, a definite yes.  I'll even put up with
the slower frame rate for it.  Now if I could just figure what kid on
hormone overload designed some of the females.  If I ever switch out of
first person and watch my high elf pally swing, I keep wondering when she's
going to topple over on her face IF she could get that far down with those
breasts.
Grrrr.  /em bonks the kid that created Dolly Parton-styled fighters and
expected them to swing anything except themselves
