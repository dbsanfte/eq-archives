Maybe because price is only 1 of 3 issues. There's still the duration and
marginality issues.

And another thing that probably weighs in subconsciously is the natural
resistance vs using charged items. I was an Alchemy GM and had a good,
sustainable source of wealth at all times so I was never wanting for
potions. I carried several types on me at all times, in fact a whole 10-pak
dedicated to them. And yet I rarely used them. Why? Because I always put a
premium on finding ways to avoid "using them up". If *I* was guity of this
kind of thinking, imagine people who had to pay me for potions.

That's what I'm talking about. This is one potion whose usage would
definitely go up radically if the price changed sufficiently. And even with
inflation, the cost may go down in absolute terms, but the relative cost
still sticks out like a sore thumb.
