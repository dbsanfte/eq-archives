Grr, don't top post. That makes a thread unreadable.

Anyway, I don't think we Iksar are KOS to the merchants in the EC
tunnel. I could not find the spell vendor when I was there, though. I
guess somebody killed it in boredom or they walk around at night or
soemthing. I assumed it was in the big 'hall' with several NPC's close
to the exit of the EC/NRo tunnel in EC.
