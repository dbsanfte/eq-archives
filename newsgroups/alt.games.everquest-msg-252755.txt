The answer, I believe, is in the question......   ....because there are many
people there interested in LDON adventures.   There doesn't have to be any
other explanation hiding behind that condition at present.  As, for 'in the
beginning'?  It is a hospitable setting, on a major highway, in a region
with which many are very familiar..... ...and what ever.  Ah, the mysteries
of life in Norrath.

Regards,

Richard.
