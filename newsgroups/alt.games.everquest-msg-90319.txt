This is exactly the reason I hate Oasis.  Every moron who overpulls thinks
that every player medding at the docks is at their beck and call.  Same with
WM in LOIO.

Read the following carefully.  If you overpull, it's your own damn fault.
Don't have the gall to endanger a bunch of folks who are hurting, oom, or
afk.  It is ~not~ their job to help save you.  If you're on CT and you train
to the docks, people will watch you die and take some degree of pleasure in
it.  Natural selection at work.

On the other hand, getting an add happens to everyone.  If you're pulling
and accidentally get an add you can't handle, take it to zone.  Period.  If
you're in a place where you can't safely bail if it gets too deep and you
can't handle an occasional add, you might want to reconsider your hunting
grounds.

And btw, near as I can tell they paid their 10 bucks this month just like
you did.  If they want to 1) Have a RP wedding, and 2) Have it on the docks,
it's their business.  Personally, I think it's kind of a crazy place to have
one due to the aforementioned morons, but hey, it's not my wedding.
