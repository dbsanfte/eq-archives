Actually... no. :) I did what you mention below.  Including the spellbook 
(why use sit? hitting /book makes you sit automatically)

Ahhhhh thanks for refreshing my memory. I knew there was a way to cast 
directly from the spell slots but I couldn't remember the key 
combination.

(Go in and look? Pfft. :) )

SoW is ALWAYS in the first slot.  I usually keep lev memorized since I 
don't mind the cost of bat wings vs the ability to outrun large stuff 
while they sweat up and down the hills :) (That gets swapped with serpent 
sight when I go blind at night)  I usually switch heal in or out with an 
offensive spell depending on what kind of hunting I'm doing.

Heck, I've been doing so little hunting lately I'm starting to forget 
where everything is.  Excuse me while I go remedy that :)
