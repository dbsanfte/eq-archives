1. Research.
You will be able to start training research at level 16. You will
spend a lot of time collecting the components that you will need to
combine in order to create your "research only" spells. Most of these
components will drop in the zones you will be hunting in when you are
at the level you need to research them. You can also auction and buy
them from players. Look up Magician Research at
http://eq.castersrealm.com


2. Tradeskills.
First and foremost....You will NOT get rich off of trade skills. The
game is designed to prevent you from making a profit in general.
Tradeskills are a lot of fun to do, and you can make some cool stuff
for yourself. As a magician I would suggest tailoring or baking.

Tailoring:
With tailoring you can make some raw-silk armor for yourself, and
other types of armor to sell to players (Cured/Wu's to monks, Leather
to Beastlords/Druids, etc). Your Water pet cannot be poisoned which
makes your class ideal for hunting spiders for silk.

Baking:
Baking is a lot of fun and very cheap to do, You can make foods that
are entertaining, (Bat wing crunchies...Birthday Cakes, etc), foods
that last much longer than vendor purchased rations, and foods that
boost stats.

A couple of tradeskill sites...

Good Luck!
