Heh, I thought that's why tradeskill were included on the game
to begin with:  to encourage whining (I've certainly done my
share of complaining about them).

Oh, and Rumble, (1) they don't call it "trivial" anymore, and
(2) it does mean a far greater than sub-50% success rate.
According to the numbers posted elsewhere you should have about
an 80% success rate.  That does not prevent you from having a
bad streak, the streak you reported isn't even all that extreme.
I've had 19 of 20 combines fail Fletching with a skill about 20
over "trivial".  EQ's RNG is streaky enough to produce large
swings in combat results (difficult mobs falling easily, mobs
you expect to be no problem killing you, etc.), which makes for
the possibility of really bad (or good!) results tradeskilling
also.
