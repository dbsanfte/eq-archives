>>> The Paladin quest is also bugged. The text is truncated and you have to
know exactly what to ask for in order to get the molds. <<<

Well, the Halfling Cleric guildmaster says <gloves> , but you have to ask
for "gauntlets" to get the mold.

The Dark Elf Necro guildmaster says <shoes> , but you have to ask for
"sandals" to get the pattern.

Apparantly, there is supposed to be at least one quest that's difficult to
figure out.
