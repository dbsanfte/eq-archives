Then what purpose would a "properly implemented" law serve?  How is
it inherently worse to shoot someone for being purple, for instance,
than for simply wearing a type of watch you want?  I'd sure be pissed
off to know that a killer got a lesser sentence because  he "just felt
like killing someone random today" while someone who went out and
killed someone "just because they were XX group."

The person, regardless of who/what they are, is just as dead, right?
Why should two killers get different sentences because of motive?
Or are some motives better than other, outside of the legitimate
motives for taking someone's life which are supposed to mean you're
innocent?
