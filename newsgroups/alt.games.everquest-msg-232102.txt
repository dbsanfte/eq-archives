From the shadows, the mysterious "Merlin Stone" <merlins@comcast.net>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Okay, my bad, I never put a site for traffic before, and didn't know there
>was a tramsfer limit/

>Will try to find another place where the site will not be limited in how
>much  it can be accessed in a single day...

Remember when you post this sort of thing to a newsgroup you not only
get a fair proportion of the regulars going there but a massive number
of lurkers who never show themselves as well. There's a lot more
people reading this newsgroup than many know.
