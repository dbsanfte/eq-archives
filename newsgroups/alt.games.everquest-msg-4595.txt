I've ignored all this drivel so far becasue I didn't want to help legitimize
this fool, but I must step in now to say that no truer words have ever been
spoken than what Dan here has said.  Of course its all the same person, they
all type the same way.  I wish everyone would just stop replying.  You'll
never win an arguement with a sociopath like that.  In his own mind, he's
perfectly normal.  Just stop replying and he'll have no reason to be here.
This newsgroup was a lot better before half the post were arguements between
a lunatic, himself, his alter egos, and all of you well meaning people who
need to realize that calling  him an idiot and a short busser will not make
him feel bad, it will satisfy his petty need to feel important and keep him
here for a long time.
