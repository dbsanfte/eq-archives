Right now the best spell of this type available to you is "Center." (At 19
you'll get "Daring")

Center has two effects:

                    AC is increased by 6

                    HP Max is increased by 85

In addition to raising the ceiling for hitpoints, the Center also adds those
HP to whatever your target has, effectively healing the target for 85 HP at
a mana cost of 40.  Compare the HP/Mana ratio to "Healing" which is
100HP/60Mana.

The level 19 upgrade Daring, by comparison, is 115HP/60Mana (with an AC+8
effect)
