I played EQ1 for 5 years or so, EQ2 briefly and am currently playing
WoW (have a 38 hunter as my highest char).  I'd agree that so far in
WoW  I'm not seeing the kind of well oiled machine that a good EQ1
group could be.  However, as I recall from EQ1, at the lower levels
groups tended to be free for alls also.  It wasn't till I started
fighting in and around Karnors, maybe in my early 40s, that I started
seeing really good groups, where we were getting chain pulls with the
chanter keeping one mob parked, and continuously fighting.  I suspect
that at the higher levels in WoW you start seeing better group
coordination.

A couple of places where WoW is better:
. WoW is much more solo friendly.  Much less "downtime". In fact,
downtime really doesn't exist in WoW.
. No zoning in WoW.  Gives you much more of a sense of immersion.
. I know some people think the graphics are "cartoony" but I think the
graphics are beautiful, and the zones seem to have much more character
than in EQ1.
. The "team pvp" between horde and alliance seems to work pretty well.
I don't do much raiding but it adds spice to the game w/o really
interfering with gameplay.
. You can actually do quests "in-game" without shouting for
information or having to read up quests on allakazam, which also adds
greatly to the immersion.
. I've never bought any equipment for my hunter... he just has lived
off drops.  He is probably relatively poorly equipped but he seems to
do ok.  I like not having to worry about getting "uber gear".

Anyway, my 2 cp.
