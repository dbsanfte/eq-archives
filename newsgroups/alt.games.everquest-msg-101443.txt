Agree. I may very well purchase PoP when it comes out (or at least order
it) given the mysterious lack of popular software titles in my area at
what passes for "normal" stores that should carry it. But given recent
history, and the fact that even if I'm a Warlord by that point, most of
my guild will not be ready to move into something even *bigger* than
what's available now. Actually, the biggest boon I can see from this is
a bit of a vacuum left in some of the 50-60 zones as the uberguilds rush
into PoP, and further cutting down competition we can't beat for
rare/contested pops now. (VS, Sev, Rage, etc.)

As for the soloers, who knows? With TheVision (TM) out the window, they
may start putting in even more stuff to accomodate them as well.
Granted, better UI and such will benefit all equally, but I would no
longer be shocked if some of the solo classes suddenly got some
enhancements that made soloing more viable, even though VI had
previously been steadfastly saying that it was a "grouping" game and
nobody was *designed* to solo. Some of the comments I've seen recently
in the mage/caster balancing discussions on the dev forum actually made
non-hostile references to the "soloability" of various classes,
including mages. You never know. The times they are a'changing, and
these things may come to pass.
