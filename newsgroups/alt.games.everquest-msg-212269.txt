What he said, specificly is "The beauty and appeal of faith is that
you don't have to think."  That's pure bunk.

Why settle for what you imagine that I "seem" to be arguing when
I'll be happy to try to make myself more clear?

There are surely folks who blindly accept the direction of their
leaders.  That the faith of many of these people is religious in
nature I do not question.  At the same time I am quite certain
that their faith is misplaced, blind faith in any human strikes
me as the height of foolishness.  And, of course, we see these
people betrayed by their leaders often enough to make it clear
that their faith is indeed blind.

That is not my faith, nor is it the faith of any of the people I
know well.  The beauty of my faith is that I _do_ have to think.
Given that the world [*] exists as an incredible creative act,
and that the world is working as intended, and I have the senses
to experience the world and the mind and the will to interpret
and make choices about the world, just what ought I to do?

[*] I'm using "world" here to encompass all of creation, not just
our little planet.
