But not entirely fixed. I was aggroed by a giant in Dreadlands after
porting in and trying to run out to FV (Pre-PoP). I had just left the
tunnels, so I ran back in and did a Feign Death. It failed and I fell to
the ground. I got up to try and fear it off while I wait for FD to
refresh, and notice the giant just standing outside the tunnel. For the
halibut, I magic debuffed it (four casts, but it finally took) and
unloaded every stacking DoT I had on it. I had Clarity, so I medded, and
refreshed DoT's as needed. I finally dropped the Giant, he never came in
to the tunnels, nor wandered off. I really expected him to warp in to
me, somehow, but it never happened.

I went on about my business, as I may verify an exploit, but I won't
exploit it. I did /bug it.
