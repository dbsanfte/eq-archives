If the internal stuff is anything like the stuff we have, they probably
don't have a lot of tools for that sort of thing, and those they do have are
probably really kludgy.

Anyone remember the first inactive guild purge?  You'd think it would have
been all automated, but no.  They ran a report which printed out the guild
numbers (I'm assuming some sort of internal ID) of the guilds to be deleted.

The numbers were then typed in manually by the server GM to disband the
guilds.  You can guess what happened.  On Povar, two uber-guilds were
disbanded because they transposed digits.

I speak from experience when I say that the guide /petition interface is all
screwed up, and obviously tacked on as an afterthought.

So given those examples, I wouldn't be at all surprised to find out that
even though it's just moving a few records from one database to another,
that it's a highly manual process.

I get the impression that the fee isn't there to generate revenue so much as
it is to discourage impulse movers.
