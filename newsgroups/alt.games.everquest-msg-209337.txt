Hi
Any hints for a twosome - lvl 56 Pally and 53 Druid that want to head for the
planes for the first time. We generally just group as a duo as we are in the UK
and not many other players around on the US server we use when we play. Where
is it best to start and any safe-ish spots.
Info appreciated. Thanks
