Thats where your rangers let you down.
I do agree with you, but I also disagree with you... AoW is a big DPS fight,
let your damage dealers die, and a still-alive MA isn't going to kill it
before mana ends.  But at the same time, let your tanks all die 1 after the
other and you wipe....

Anyway, reason i said the rangers let you down... if theres one thing they
are good at, its GETTING AGRO NOW.  That combined with weaponshield (which,
unlike other discs allows them to maintain agro whilst invulnerable) gives
you a whopping 20 seconds to get yourselves sorted again.  20 seconds is
huge at times like this.

You don't need to wait 10+ seconds before taking agro (by this point, you've
lost 1/4 of your raid anyway), but you do need to wait till healing is
shifted onto you.

Quick heals should be what keeps you alive during the transition (ie the
first 10-15seconds of the tank switch), and of course, not agroing till
defensive is engaged.

With fast heals tho, you only have to wait 2-3 seconds (basically once your
told, or see the heal inc messages) before you can ae taunt and be confident
the rotation will keep you up.
