I would like some suggestions on equip ( armor and weapons ) for a VS 
Rogue.  I am far from rich, so I guess I'm looking for stuff that a low to 
mid-twenties rogue would be wielding / wearing.  Or, something that I could 
possibly obtain with my 35 chanter and a friend or two.  As a reference 
point, plat-wise, I probably won't spend more than 2k.

Thanks for the earlier advice on beginning stats.
