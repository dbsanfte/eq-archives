Funny how you are trying to twist a rule about BUGS into a rule about
guard tactics.  Even funnier that you seem to think yourself qualified to
label the existence of tactics as bugs.  That's really the funniest thing
about you, TwoHead.  You are a self-appointed rules judge who takes swipes
at any "rules lawyer" who calls you on your BS.

Well, more pathetic than funny really.
