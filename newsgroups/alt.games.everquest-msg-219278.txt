I agree with you. The time investment to get to GM is about right. But 
the fun factor is well below par. At the end of the day this is a game, 
and exploring the various game functions should be fun.

I agree in principle. But I'm not exactly enamoured with the uninspired 
alternative they came up with either.

I think your rationalizing a bit. Whether I skill up or not I still get 
the next ring of spells, even if I don't cast a single spell. Plus the 
caster rarely has to spend hours in a corner casting a spell over and 
over just for skill ups; he can do it as 'part of playing the game', the 
game balance is such that he skills up fast enough through normal play...

The same does not apply to tradeskills... there is no booming trade for 
banded armour, the tradesman would be unlikely to find a buyer for a 
single set, never mind the countless piles of the stuff he has to make 
to skill up... at the high end it starts working out... but the 
tradeskills aren't pointless and tedious at the top.

Perhaps you forgot 'spell research'? Isn't that supposed to simulate 
'reasearching spells'?? Go out, grab components, combine them in your 
box, and poof you have a spell... not... sit your ass in cloistered 
tower for a decade
