Just to add to the info for lower level alchemists,
Last night Iturned 3 stacks worth of ingredients into SoW potions with
my skill  at 35.

I added up my successes after the first 40 attempts and I have 28 SoW
potions.

I worked on the next 20 for a friend and got 15 out of 20.

So I am guestimating that my success rate is just a point or two
better than 70% at Sow Potions with a skill of only 35.

I know this isnt what you were asking but I often follow a thread to
see if I get any other related tidbits of info so I thought I'd
through in my own bit, or was it a tid?
