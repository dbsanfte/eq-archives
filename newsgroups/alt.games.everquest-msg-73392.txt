Better yet, just switch to full screen mode by hitting F10.  You will still
get the small screen when you are meditating, and possibly when interacting
with merchants, looting, or looking at your inventory, depending on whether
or not you have Scars of Velious installed.  Personally, I hate waiting for
my monitor to resync when the resolution changes, so I leave the "Screen
Same Resolution" selected.
