Can't say for sure, I'm an MM, not a CT.  Still, four of five radios were
jammed, and the one that was up was the "broadcast" radio.

Again, I don't know.  Twenty some of the thirty four people killed were in
research, though.

They were finally able to get the FLASH message through during the attack.
Had they not, then the U.S. fleet wouldn't have been on their way, and the
attack wouldn't have stopped.  The Liberty most likely would have been sunk.

Along with the Hull numbers and Ship's name on the Fantail.  Also, a Isreali
pilot identified the ship and was told to go forward with the attack
anyways.

Most likely expediancy.  Also, that doesn't preclude going that route, the
accusation is that the Liberty was the one doing the spying.

The Liberty was away from the fleet.  One of the sailors dead was a GM, so I
assume weapons mounts were attacked first.

Still, it's a tribute to the DC teams aboard the Liberty.
