It's easier to get into PoP's locked zones than it is to get into 
Luclin's locked zones.

What amazes me is how things like the alternate access quest for Sol Ro 
is trivial, but hardly anyone knows about it or does it.  However, 
they're happy to bitch about not being able to get into the zone, for 
example.  It's weird.
