This might be true, if everyone was as totally fucking stupid as you are.

Here is the relevant passage, to maybe enlighten that dim bulb that is
rarely (and with much humor) refered to as "your brain":

=====================================================
Charges will be made directly to your credit card on file. When moving
characters between accounts, billing information must be identical on both
accounts and you must be the original owner of both accounts. If billing or
other account registration information is different or inconsistent in any
manner, your request will not be processed, you will be notified via email
and we will investigate the reason for the inconsistent or different
information.
=====================================================

Now, for the slow of wit (btw, "None", I'm refering to YOU when I say
that), this means that if you buy a character on ebay and want to transfer
it, not only are you paying for the ebayed account, not only are you paying
even more on top of that to move the character(s), not only are you
spending even MORE money to buy a new copy of the game on top of that...YOU
MUST ALSO REGISTER YOUR NEW ACCOUNT WITH THE EBAYED ACCOUNT'S 
ORIGINAL NAME AND CREDIT CARD NUMBER.

Do those events strike you as being terribly likely to occur?

That's a good boy. Now go play in the street.
