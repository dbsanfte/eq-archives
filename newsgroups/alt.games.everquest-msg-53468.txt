Hehe, not the only wierd mob in CS.
Was with 3 from my guild killing wyverns by pulling them down to the
beach. Were having fun and getting easy XP, so the wizard decide to
explore a little while one of the other pulls. We get a wyvern and are
having great fun beating it up (a high aggro debuff spell from me make it
mad at me, so the rogue, shaman and shaman pet run around and hit it in
the back for around 50% HP before it aggro on them), and suddently the
wizard shout "Chest".
We of course think its a joke and reply with funny comments as Head, Body
and so on, untill she come running up on the beach being chaced by a large
chest with teeth jumping after her.
Nasty piece of furniture if you ask me, was a little risky killing it, but
fun as hell. The chest looked a little like Pacman when it was jumping
around chasing people.
But hard, had to save a level 50+ necro from it just before we left.

Got a few pics of that fun encounter, you can see them here if you want:
