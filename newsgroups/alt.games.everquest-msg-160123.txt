I am a 37 Warrior wielding a wurmslayer (25/40)  and Centi SS (12/25) and
I have no problem keeping agro (although my FBSS helps making those a bit
quicker).  Just make sure (although I am sure you know) that Taunt and
Disarm (Taunt2) are maxxed out.

Personally I like that hard hitting wurmslayer, I had posted on here about
perhaps changing it, but the hard hitting really pisses the mobs off :)
