Just about every NPC that wants cash as part of a quest
seems to say "NNN gold, it must be gold..."

But every time I've experimentally tried completing such
a quest with an equivalent value of pp, it has worked just
fine.

I've done it with more than a dozen "smaller" quests,
I haven't dared try it out on a rare quest like JBoots,
but indications are that the quest code in EQ considers
pp an acceptable substitute for gp.

If in doubt, though, lug along the gp, just to be sure.
