I stopped crafting several weeks ago when I could purchase certain books
in the under 10th level range.  The refining books IIRC. So I started
harvesting and made a ton of $$ from that.

Yesterday, I played my 6th level alt on a different server.  In the
graveyard, I got 6 artisan books in an hour and a half.  What a joke.
This crafting isn't the fun I was hoping for.
