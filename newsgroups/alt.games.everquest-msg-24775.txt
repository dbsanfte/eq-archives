    At tenth level, one point of INT gives two mana. So all 60 INT this gear
gives will make only 120 mana. Given that a person at 130 INT, level 10 has
280 MANA base, you won't notice the extra mana as much as you'd like. Given
your ENCH has no weapon listed, and MUST kill with spells, this could be a
serious flaw.

>Slot: Item Name (int) - camp (location/mob)/buy

    Few quick comments.

>arm: gatorscale sleeves (4) - camp (upper guk/an ancient croc) or buy

    Longish camp, you could also get Gator Legs for the monk here if he
doesn't already have a pair.

>back: kunzar cloak (2) - buy
>chest: crystalline robe (6) - camp (crystal caverns/queen dracnia) or buy

    Queen sounds too tough to solo camp - ask on Monkly Business, but I'm
guessing it won't happen.

>ears: batskull x2 (10) - camp (timorous deep/the great oowomp)
>face: sheer bone mask (3) - camp (timorous deep/the great oowomp)

    Also off Chief Goonda in West Karana.

>feet: polished stone anklet (2) - camp (field of bone/burynai cutter)

    Hellish rare spawn, all for two INT. You'd be better off either camping
Wolf Fur Slippers in Perma, or Kobold Hide Boots in Sol A.

>fingers: velium fire wedding rings x2 (0) - buy
>hands: impskin gloves (5) - buy or camp (sol a/kindle)

    Fairly expensive, brutally long camp. Do yourself a favour and go after
Dusty Bloodstained Gloves from Mistmoore instead - AC 2 MANA 25. While there
you might even pick up some Opalline Earrings to swap the Batskulls for.

>head: runed circlet (4) - buy, or nightshade wreath (5) - camp
(mistmoore/maid
>issis) or buy

    I think you could camp the Runed Circlet in Perma. Might not be worth
the hassle, but it's an option.

>legs: drake hide legs - buy

    Easy camp, if you want to do it. Really, a bunch of the items you could
use all come from one section of Sol A. ;-)

>primary: stein of moggok (10) - buy
>secondary: crude stein (0) - buy

    Not having any weapon for a low-level ENCH is really going to blow. Will
you always be grouped? Are you being PLed up a ways first? Do you know how
cruddy an ENCH pet is?
