Where the Hell did you get that? How am I trying to be thier
conscience? How was my post in any way elitest?

If you had actually read my post, you would know that what I find
upsetting is when a player expects me to just sit on my ass doing
nothing while they run off for KEI. I ask again, how am I being
elitest by being upset by this? If anything, it's the God Damned
Cleric's who expect the group to wait for them that are being elitest,
'cause what else are we gonna do? Without a healer, we might as well
just go home.
