I can confirm it, happened to me in the Overthere last night.  

Had a Kunark Rhino snared, started to lay the beats in, cast Panic
Animal, and he starts moving away and I lay in from behind.  Cast it
the second time, and he disappears.  Mob was at maybe 75% health.

I spin aroun to see if he took off in a different direction, but he's
nowhere visible, and not anywhere in the tracking window: no Rhino's
to be found.  Track skill is high enough that  a snared mob shouldn't
get out of range.

Sat back and medded for a while; didn't want to engage anything with a
rhino potentially coming in the middle of a fight, so I zoned back to
PoK and back before continuing.  Definetly odd.
