They should put a 'plat cap' on items. Some of the stuff in the bazaar
goes for way too much for its stats. Asked why they say '"It's a rare
drop". Big deal, more interested in the stats. That, IMO, is why
people are paying real money for plat and such. 15k for your basic
"Copper Hammer of Striking". Sorry the stats, again IMO, don't warrant
the high price never mind the fact the proc was nerf'd to level 50
from 35. PO'd me off since I was saving up for one at 32 and SOE did
that. Now I'm 51 and the proc would do squat to mobs at this level
anyways so why bother?
