Hi, Im kinda new to the game and Id like to get some honest opinions
about this. Even though this is probably going to cause some flames
and/or people calling me a troll, I really do want to know your
opinion on this.  I started playing EQ about 7 weeks ago now and have
made a cleric as my main.  Ive gotten him up to lvl 48 with a lot of
playing time but have yet to find a way to make good PP.  Ive been
told clerics as a whole dont solo well, it seems to be correct as I
have yet to find anything I can solo that gives good loot.  So even
though Ive gotten this far, Im still so broke, Im wearing some of my
newbie quest armour.

Ok, on to my question. Whenever I get into a group, be it ldon or a
pickup group, Im expected to temp people in the group. This costs me
almost 11 PP per spell.  I hardly ever get anyone offering me anything
in return for this expenditure and almost always leave loosing money.
Ive pretty much given up doing ldon's because at best I make 50PP from
them before I pay for dot's.  Ive had others suggest I be the ML and
take my costs off the top before splitting the loot but this to me
feals like stealing from my fellow players( I would have to have a
sense of fair play wouldnt I ;-)  ).  

What I want to know is, why do people expect me to give them this buff
without payment for my costs when I can hardly afford the dots needed?
In the week Ive had the spell I have only had about 10% of the people
give me a dot to use for the spell or 10pp to help cover the cost.  Im
sure that after awhile this will seem a trivial cost to me but right
now it isnt.  

If anyone has found a solution or has any positive suggestions for me
Id appreciate hearing them as well.
