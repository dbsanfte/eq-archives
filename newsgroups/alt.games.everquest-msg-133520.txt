Acquired as in, were given because you can use it and didn't have it?
Forgive the assumption if that isn't so, just seems the most likely
scenario, given your description.

If whoever gave it to you (or didn't roll) did so because they assumed
you would use/scribe it, then by selling it, you are ripping them off.
I'm sure they could use the cash from selling it, just as much as you
could. See NBG thread above about people views on this.

If you bought it, ignore me. Then again, I doubt you'd be buying a spell
you didn't want if you were already saving for something else.
