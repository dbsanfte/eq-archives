Well, the fact that I tried it with the warrior class didn't help. Aside 
from that, I've farmed my share of spider(ling) silks and animal hides in 
my time to have developed a strong aversion to it at this point.

My problem didn't stem from the fact that I didn't know how to go about 
obtaining the funds to purchase the level-inappropriate gear, but more the 
fact that I had to do that in order to be on a level playing field. It's no 
wonder so many people buy plat in EQ these days.
