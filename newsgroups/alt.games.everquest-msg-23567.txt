you know, I kinda thought that fletching was a useless skill for an
enchanter (or wizard in my case).

Then I found out about the Coldain Prayer Shawl Quests.
I've only finished the first four. so far, I've had to learn baking and
pottery. and if I expect to continue, I need to learn tailoring, jewelcraft,
and, you guessed it, Fletching. (and that's only up to the 7th...I have no
clue what will be necessary for the 8th, 9th and 10th, if they exist)

now, I still think it's a useless skill, but we're forced to learn it if we
want these items.

so, just because it doesn't make sense, doesn't mean there isn't a good
reason for it.
