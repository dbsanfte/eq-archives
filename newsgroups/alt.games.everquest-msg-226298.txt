There is more than one way to abuse customers. This has nothing to do 
with 'failing to deliver what they promised'.

They are product tying, which is illegal in many cases precisely because 
it is often considered an abuse of the consumer. In this case it isn't 
illegal but it still rubs the same way, particularly because they have 
tied an undesirable but fairly expensive product with a virtually 
worthless but fairly desirable beta slot.

(TYING ARRANGEMENT - An (often illegal)agreement requiring that a as a 
precondition of purchasing or obtaining services, that other services 
must be purchased and must be purchased through the seller. Not all 
tying arrangements are unlawful. In most instances banks and other 
lending institutions may not require borrowers to purchase credit life 
or disability insurance as a precondition of a loan.)
