That would be what most people would assume a "deficit"
would be, yes.   And that's just what happens today, of course,
with the exception that you de-level to 14 (or even lower.)
You still have to "MAKE UP" the lost XP;  de-leveling is simply
a side effect.

A "deficit" would imply a penalty, unlike what you're describing.

Actually, coding to de-level is inherently more complex than code
to simply level once.   Simply setting a level flag whenever you pass
a certain point is one manipulation and doesn't require any other
code;  once  you're able to scribe a spell, for instance, you can use
the spell.   De-leveling requires not only manipulating that data
again but also code that doesn't allow you to mem spells you have
scribed or abilities you have lost (the various discs, for instance)
along with code they've put in to stop the various PvP "exploits"
where people would level, build skills, then de-level in order to have
substantial PvP advantages.

So, no, it's probably a lot simpler than you think to simply make any
level earned permanent.
