Wouldn't it be considered even something like a civic duty
to send them there?

Like, all at one time? With the  price of oil going up for a while
but meanwhile glassware becomes dirt cheap?

I've never understood how the Israelis could be as lenient as
they have been.  If they kill one Israelis, they retaliate and
kill 40.  The next day the Palestinians are killing another one
of theirs.  If they just went and killed a _lot_ of them, maybe
somebody would be too busy with funeral preparations to
throw rocks for a few days.  As in, nobody that is physically
able to pick up a rock happens to be alive at the moment
(said moment lasting 20 years or so).

I have no trouble comprehending it...and when it's directed against
me and my family, the only way I _KNOW_ with 100% certainty
that it won't happen again is to kill a vast majority of them.

With 85% of your people dead, no food, no aerable land, and
no industry, who is gonna throw rocks at you now?

I don't even see that as harsh...they see it as their mission to
die like that.  Their families bless their course in life.  They raise
more children to strap  bombs to, brainwashed or not.  When
80% of your population resides in a pile of glass (resides =
permanently), and it's a daily struggle to feed and house yourself,
will you spend much time plotting against Satan 12,000 miles away?

Again, that's why I have these feelings, too.  The Japanese in WWII
thought sorta the same things, but not fervently.  They were happy
to die for their god-emperor, but that fervent praise didn't reach
back home to every man-woman-child.  In the Middle East, it does.
When a father of a 16 year old is GLAD his son died to bomb a
nightclub, and he HOPES his other 4 children can follow in their
brother's footsteps, how can you combat that?  You can't.

If you want it to stop, you stop them living...mostly all of them at
one time, violently.  Japan wasn't as hardcore in their beliefs, so
they learned their lesson at the price of two cities gone.  I'd hate
to play tootsie-roll pop guessing games with "How many cities
have to become piles of glass in Afganistan before they give up
all their terrorists to us?"  But I wouldn't be against it if that's what
it takes.  Maybe we'd luck out and it would only be one.  Maybe
not, but then again, we'd definately not have to worry about it
in the future.  Ever.

That's the great thing...nothing to  question about lessons learned
with that route...
