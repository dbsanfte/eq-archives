Take it from someone who frequently farms pelts that it's rare to find a
buyer at more than 100pp when the owlbears are up and up to 200pp when they
have been gone for a while. If you have time to wait you may get more but I
can make money faster than by waiting to sell at higher prices.  On zebux
the patterns are selling for 500pp on average and are usually the biggest
part of the cost of a rallic pack.  Any level 20 (and most classes at much
lower) can farm pelts from owlbear cubs and that keeps the prices down. I'd
like to see anyone attempt the runner at less than 40th level.  The cubs
seem to be have the highest drop rate of all the owlbears too,  seems
strange that the weaker mob has the better loot.....
