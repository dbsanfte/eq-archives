Well, not the guild. ;) And they're not really to blame - we're so 
varied in levels and times that we play that getting a real all-guild 
group together is highly difficult.

Add to that the fact that there are a half dozen I wouldn't group with 
if you paid me. ;p

*ahem* As I was saying.  The two I'm grouping with now live together, 
and it was a fluke that I ended up in a group with them to start with.  
So this is indeed a joyful time.  Got invited into their group again 
tonight and they thanked *me* for the group at the end.  Managed to make 
2 1/2 levels tonight, nice change from "31 rogue lfg, pst. (wait 10 
minutes repeating every so often. give up. run from dsp to ot. repeat 
cry. wait 10 minutes. give up. run to hhk.  wait for half an hour until 
a spot in someone's group opens.  level and watch the lootwhores strain 
their knees.)"

NOT that I was starting to remember why I hated levelling Taellaar so 
much for awhile there. ;)

Oh, and on another note, 160 poison making, 160 pick lock, hide and 
sneak well into the 100s, and ID in the 70s.  I am doing a MUCH better 
job of keeping the skills up and, as I'd hoped, it makes things a lot 
easier.  The worshipful look in the eyes of new rogues doesn't hurt 
either.  *g*
