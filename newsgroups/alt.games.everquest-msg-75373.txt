Nope. Gfay will generally be faster and easier even taking the boat
though. Nk can be pretty long running through rivervale or high hold
and all (unless someone is porting). For some dumb reason I had my
dark elf in freep run all the way to the NK spires even though she had

(while she is fine in freeport and can simply jump off the boat when
it reaches butcher to run to gfay..)
