I have hardly ever had a hard time getting the buffs i wanted from other
pc's let me tell you the secret.... hehe Buff others..... as a necro, i have
very few buffs... dmf, cold resist, spirit armor, all minor stuffs, but
whenever Im at a druid ring, or nexus portal, i buff everyone on sight, at
least with DMF.... sometimes I dont get any buffs back, but mosttime,
without me asking, i am so buffed up by everyone, I wouldnt want any more,
cause it obstructs my view  )

Even if the other party doesnt neccesarily need or want thebuff you have to
offer, its amazing how willing people are to spend mana on you if you do so
on them. Last night, i buffed 5 people with DMF sittting on the portal to
DL.... within 1 minute, I had Aeogilism, Regrowth, sow, KEI, and assorted
others... )
