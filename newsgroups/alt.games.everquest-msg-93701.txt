Speaking from the cleric's perspective only, not as an experienced
ranger, I say use your lesser weapons and avoid drawing agro in the
first  place is your best bet.  Don't let the knowledge that  you could
do more damage with your best weapons get in the way of the logic of not
getting hit.  You'll find in many places running around trying to get
out of agro range only causes adds, leading to TPWs and forced evacs, so
not getting hit is your first choice, standing there  till warrior
taunts it off of you is your second choice.  Again, this is from my
perspective as a cleric and of course we all hate rangers so don't let
my negativity bother you <g>.
