But, in that case, you could likely have just as easily accomplished it 
without the mage pet, sure, the extra damage is nice, but not necessary.   
The mage fire pet strategy used to be to use the mage fire pets as the 
only ones in AoE range, as they were 100% immune to fire damage, so were 
only taking melee damage.  Buff them to the gills with hp to take the 
melee damage, heal them as needed, and Rak goes down.  Now, the better 
strategy appears to be to use at least one high FR tank class, with 
whatever other damage dealing can be added in to speed up the fight.
