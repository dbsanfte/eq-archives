Thanks for the info. Basically i want to get him to 10 so we can group and
play together and hes new to the whole AD&D genre so he needs a kick start.
The only gear i will give him is the stuff that someone handed me at low
level and asked i pass it on :) well its a velium weapon and some little
stuff, but he needs his skills up so a high damahe output weapon wouldnt be
much use if he cant hit with it.
Thanks again
