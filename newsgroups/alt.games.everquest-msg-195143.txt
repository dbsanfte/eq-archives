We'll be heading to Fungus Grove real soon to finish the BST epic for one 
of our BSTs.  The final mob is "Draz Nurakk".

Someone said in guildchat that he can only be hit by the BST that is 
wielding the special claws and by spells - he's immune to all other melee 
damage.

What's the scoop on this guy?  Is the above true?  Is he Slowable?  
Resistant to particular spells?

Any info is appreciated.
