}Do you guys that play shims get hassled like that?

Occasionally.  It's a lot easier to shrug it off when you know that if it 
ever spilled over into RL somehow, someone is in for a nasty suprise.  My 
DE female Wiz has had significantly more troubles than my Barbie warrior, 
though.  But /ignore and /petition are such useful tools, although I've 
only had to use them for that once or twice.  Good to know they're there 
though.

The part that really sucks, though, is when you actually meet a nice guy
who's not being extremely pushy, and you become friends, and you know at 
some point you're going to have to break RP and -tell- him, and worry 
about how he's going to take it.  I remember on my first character 
(well, first that got past level 2... the DE :) ) a guy who was very sweet 
and was a hunting partner for a couple days, and that I got along with 
pretty well,  And then suddenly the trade window popped up with a ring in 
it that he'd clearly scrimped and saved for.  Oh jeez, how to turn him 
down gently without hurting his feelings...  I just told him he was way 
too young for me.  Eventually, I found a good time to tell him the RL 
gender issue (I was rather amazed that he hadn't guessed.  With men, 
subtle hints just don't get you -anywhere-.  I logged on one of my male 
characters, and he -still- assumed I was a girl playing a guy now.  Sigh.)  
And it led to long conversations about why I'd do such a thing, and what 
women presumably wanted, but eventually, it screwed up our partnership.  
He just wanted something from the partnership of questionable 
appropriateness that I couldn't provide.

So now, if you inspect my shims, the little message box says, "I'm a man.  
deal with it."

I'm not so fond of the term 'shim', though.  Mostly, I just don't get it.  
What does being male and playing a female character have to do with the 
thin slats of wood used in window hanging?

And a female playing a male character?  Is that then a 'sham'?

Personally, I think playing a shim is a valuable experience.  Specifically 
because you get to see the ways that men behave that annoy the living shit 
out of women, and exactly -why- it annoys them, and then it makes it so 
much easier to make sure you don't behave that way yourself.  It's like 
the old drag queen saying, "You can learn more by wearing a dress for a 
day than by wearing a suit for a lifetime."

So do any of our females-playing-males feel they learn anything 
comparable?
