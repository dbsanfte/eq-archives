You have to have a certain amount of mass to develop enough
gravitational force to collapse the body in on itself and generate a
chain fusion reaction. The planet Jupiter nearly two thirds the mass
required to create a star. It generates far more heat than it takes in
from the sun. And it's *still* not nearly big enough. If you had Jupiter
orbiting Norrath, you'd be destroyed. A star???????? Not.
