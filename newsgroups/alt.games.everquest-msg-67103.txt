Again, Lokari completely disses another person's right to express.
Lokari is good, Lokari is God. Just ask him/her/it.

Numbnuts aside, you are correct, I feel (see Lokari, these are
opinions - not supremem truths).  They call it Evercrack for a reason.
people are addicted and will play through hell and back.

In fact it is ironic that the ever-arguing one, Lokari, is the same
person who posts about how the patches are worth it. Most of the
patches have been fiascos.  Lokari has his own special VI teet.

Lokari - you probably get off on me chewing on your troll ass. Do
yourself a favor and get off your high horse. Give opinions and let
others give opinions. Don't come across as though you possess some
omniscient knowledge. Certainly from a sociological standpoint, you
are infantile and lack understanding of debate and persuasiveness.

BTW, you must of posted your first post at some point, did you not? I
bet it was great hearing from you back then too.
