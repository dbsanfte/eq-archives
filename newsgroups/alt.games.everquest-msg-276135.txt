Falling into a trap in Najena is another good place to lose a corpse at 
the lower levels. Even dieing at the bottom of blackburrow can make for 
an impossible CR depending on class.

Very foolish indeed. If your going to die and don't have locate/summon 
corpse head for a landmark not into the ocean. =)

Easy to get to, but if you didn't have a loc, perhaps hard to find =)

I go through Rivervale. The trip through Kith to HH is trivial from 
there, especially if invis to undead. ... Or just make the trip around 
2-3pm (game time). A little patience is a virtue =)

Dieing to wanderers in outside zones are generally trivial to recover 
from, provided you had the sense to /loc, or die by a landmark.

But yeah, dieing deep in most dungeons with many classes is often 
impossible to recover from.
