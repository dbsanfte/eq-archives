*Every* action performed in the name of affirmative action is by definition
discrimonatory.  The fact that affirmative action is considered a good thing
by anyone, even and maybe especially by black people, is mind boggling.

The fact that it is trumpeted by that segment of the population that
considers themselves the most human interest oriented, benevolently
enlightened segment, goes beyond mind-boggling.  It makes me lose hope for
the human race.
