Quite Simply -

If you're not a Ranger or Druid - find one and hit the Lake of Ill Omen -
Bloodgills goblins - truly exceptional XP (you should do 48 and maybe even
49 in one day of hard work!) These little buggers suck on loot (although
Harpoon of the Depths may drop - quick coupla hundred plat there, as well as
coins for the BRD tambourine) but they flat out rock on XP. I dinged 50 and
51 on them.. took my r/l wife's 49 RNG there and got here a full gold bub of
XP to ding her into 50 in 9 mobs.

 Best option -

 There is a platform out in the lake that is only partially submerged, so
you can sit on it with your head sticking above the water. Have the tracker
go and pull em to this platform (fast and easy). Most you'll pull is 2, and
they're not all that tough (was soloing 2 at a time for lvl 50 as a
Paladin). There's about 8-10 spawns on roughly 18 minute timers. If you
clear out all the spawns you can have the tracker pull some of the higher
level fish in there to pass the time and get even more XP (although fish
must be fought underwater of course.. make sure you have enduring breath!)

The only down side is the Lake of Ill Omen is usually chock full of /ooc and
/shout'ing idiots.. so be warned.. low IQ zone!! :)

And it's rather funny to shout out DING! 50!!! and then get half a billion
/tells about "How did you ding in here?" "What were you hunting?" "There are
mobs in here that high??"

Enjoy!
