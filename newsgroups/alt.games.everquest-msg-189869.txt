Heh, warriors like myself have been ranting and raving about agro as long as
I
can remember.  And, you are right, there is no reason to nerf the Paladin or
SKs.  The hate procs have definately helped.  Unfortunately they are very
difficult to aquire.  Slight ajustments to Warrior taunt and maybe slight
adjustments
to the damage tables might help.
