Has anyone actually been sucessfull loading custom skins yet?  The default
skin is SO boring now after getting used to the good stuff.

I'm sure we'll have to mix and match some files and go in and edit a
few....but if someone more computer savy can put it here in simple language
for us simple folk it would be appreciated.  :)
