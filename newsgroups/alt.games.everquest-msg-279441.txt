Yeah. But the point is it IS red. It sticks out. 

The fact that its -red- is actually one of the main factors. If it was 
just a mildly brighter green than auction I'd bet few people would 
notice or care.

Red pushes peoples buttons.

Seem like a pitch to me. Every last one of them. But apparently we 
differ on the point. :)

Your right: /shouting in EQ is FAR FAR more annoying, and equally far 
less necessary. So don't do it.

:p

Seriously though, how can you stipulate that there exists ANY scenario 
where /shout is appropriate at all, without invoking some sort of RL 
comparison?

Especially when taking into account that the /ooc and /auction channels 
also exist, and are used by convention for all this chatter, further 
perpetrating and even enabling the stigma that's been attached to /shout 
and undermining any game mechanics rationale for using /shout.
