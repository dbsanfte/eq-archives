Thank you.

> but this should have been fixed in beta.

Certainly.  All the problems should have been fixed in beta.  Not only in
this game, but in every game.  Tit for tat though, DAoC was released with
far far fewer problems than any game of its kind to date, not the least of
which is EQ.

That's a good question.  Probably time and resource limitations.  The same
limitations that caused EQ, UO, and AO to be released with a great many
extrememly important bugs.

Only in the cities would be fine.  Though I hope it is a much broader range.
How you can say the addition of an auction channel doesn't negate his
negative, when his negative is the absence of an auction channel is beyond
me.

My framerate is smooth is silk. Looks like Disney animation.  My specs are
the same as yours except I'm using a Geforce 3.  I wonder if this frame rate
problem could be lag related.  I've heard they have lag issues with overseas
connections.  Are you in the U.S.?

Backing up *should* be slower.  This is getting very picky.

LOL.  EQ's first month?  For the first 3 weeks I was lucky to log on and
stay on for an hour.  My first class was a rogue, and it wasn't until after
the launch of the first expansion over a year later that the skills that I
had acquired and spent points on either worked or had a function.

EQ is a great game, but there is no comparison between its buggy,
problematic release and the near impeckable release of DAoC.

It is unfortunate that you are having a framerate problem, but you are
certainly the rare exception.

Didn't I see you praising the game on the DAoC newsgroup?

Best Regards
