This is just with your 2nd acct cleric? (you do
have one, or am I confusing you with someone else?)

From the mage viewpoint, 2 55 mages can do quite a job
on a reaver, until that #$%# blinding fear spell sends
them running into the 2nd house.  This was before pets 
were made neutral, so I'd love to try this again, especially
with the new reist changes.  When I make it to 59 it will
be straightforward - valiant companion will help out tremendously.
