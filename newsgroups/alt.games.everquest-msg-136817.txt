Someone was selling Aegolism for 450pp.  Had three copies.  I bought
em all, stuck one in the bank (hey, at my current blue per day rate
I'll be 60 in under a month!) and sold the other two at 2kpp each
overnight.... still under the 4K+ that everyone else was selling at.

So for under 1500pp I got Aegolism plus 4Kpp in sales.

Doesn't suck
