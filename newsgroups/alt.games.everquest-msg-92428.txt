I have posted before about my misadventure (jail area) in this wonderful
city and have recently spent a lot of time here while farming for
Lightcrawler armor in DSP.  If you have never been here, it is a HUGE city
zone. All dazzling white marble (or the Luclin equivalent) and easy to get
lost in.

What is really sad is that there is NEVER anyone in this zone.  Most of the
time I am the ONLY person in the zone.  It seems such a waste that someone
designed and created such a nice city that is empty all the time (except for
when there were about 30 lvl60 Rising Ascension members there...still don't
know what that was all about).

The fact that it is not a starting city for any race is probably the main
reason it is empty.  I really don't know what can be done to entice players
here...but it just seems a shame that it's always empty.
