I am still new to EQ, having played just over a month.  The only reason
I started playing was in anticipation of EQ2, which, by all accounts
from my friends who have been following development of EQ2, fixes what
EQ has 'broken'.  There is more of an emphasis on smaller raids (24
people is the max), and not nearly the key/unlocking drill (which caused
one of my friends to quit, she was an officer of a raiding guild and her
job was to schedule the keyings).

I think one of the reasons I enjoy EQ so much is that it seems so
'full'.  My first MMORPG was SWG, and that game is just fundamentally
broken, as well as hollow - even 15 months after launch.  EQ has so much
more depth to it, the difference is amazing (of course, four more years
of development tends to do that, but SWG is abandoning its inital vision
and going FPS in space with the first expansion).  I did try CoH, and
got utterly bored to tears with it in about three weeks.  So far, EQ
seems to be the best out there (tried EVE for awhile)..

I will play both games for awhile, until I notice that one or the other
is getting neglected.
