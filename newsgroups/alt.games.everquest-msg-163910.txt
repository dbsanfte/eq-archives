    hmm except that they dont seem interested in selling the keys. I've got
5 friends now who have bought kunark velious and luclin but if I want them I
too must purchase a cardboard box, some cd's a map, some posters and a mouse
matt with pictures of a cute blonde woman with very large breasts (you know
why they call them expansion packs? her boobies get bigger with each one's
artwork!) when in fact the only thing im going to use out of that box are
the little labels with the keys on them.

    Why the bloody hell cant I just buy the keys from verant with my CC,
have them emailed to me and avoid paying:

    a) for all the junk listed above
    b) retail markup on all the junk listed above to some computer store
who've had nothing to do with the development or marketing (to the point
where i found out about it) for the game
    c) transport to above retail store from the US of above junk?

6) cos verant want to support retail stores because thats conventionally
where people buy computer games and they're interested in expanding EQ's
market more into the mainstream, where there is loads of mula for them.

I still think they should sell keys separately to support us geeks tho
