As an addendum to what the others have answered well, I've setup hotkeys for
use in downtime.
One is just a macro
/doability 1 (sneak)
/doability 2 (hide)
/doability 3 (sense heading)
/doability 4 (sense traps)

You could also substitute the last line (4) for a repeat of the first two.
This would de-activate your Sneak/Hide for next cycle.  It's also helpful to
put this on the same bank as S & H so that you can see when the cycle is
done to re-hit.
This works great while sitting.  In fact, I STRONGLY recommend that whenever
you're resting in an area where there are any wandering mobs (even Orc
Pawns) that would disrupt your rest, to use S & H.  Just let your group know
what you're doing so they don't worry when you pop out.... and I don't
"officially" recommend S & H + "/em has gone LINKDEAD"

Later, I'll be adding Instill Doubt to my macro.
