It's doable, but painful. You do have to pick your spots though.

PoV is doable, as is PoS if you stay away from the slow mitigating
mobs (Giants/Frogs). CoD is out, you'll eventually get a spawn close
to zone that's unslowable and hits for over 700, no way to keep up
with that kind of damage. In tier 3, HoH is also doable, not really
sure about tactics. Been farming Veksar lately to finace my spells so
haven't spent all that much time in Tactics since I got flagged.
