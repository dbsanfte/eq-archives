Heck, it was *easier* for them, unless they happened to know about that 
single spawn (I never saw it until long after I'd found the gob camps, 
and then I just happened to explore to see what was down that way).  I

as a clam.  I also /ooc'd offering the stacks and stacks of arrows to 
anybody who wanted them.
