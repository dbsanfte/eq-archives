Ditto. I have 2 problems with the lower level content restrictions. First,
these trivial mobs still attack me. Which means I have to waste time and
resources to defeat them with no chance of reward. It's not like swatting a
gnoll or something here.  Some of those mobs in Stonebrunt are a pain to put
down. Second, most of my friends have left or moved on in some way. No uber
guild for me. I still enjoy EQ but mostly because I can see new lands and do
new quests. What if that new quest gives a nice mask? I'm a 52 druid, but I've
never been on a raid because I don't have those kind of connections. I'm to be
kept from said item because I grew up in the wrong time frame in the life of
EQ? I guess Verant has decided that players like me, those who have been with
the game since day one, are expendable now. The newer players and the like are
the priority. I suppose it makes sense, if we're what's wrong with the economy,
find a way to remove that last measure of joy for us so we'll leave. 
No, I've never stolen a camp, steal-killed a newbie, or harrassed anyone, ever.
I just like to drop in for a few hours, run around help out, and due some
quests or kill an un-engaged mob to improve my faction or get an item that's
better than what I'm wearing.  I so love the game, so even this won't cause me
to quit, yet. What's scary is that Verant knows this. They are holding the
trump card and not afraid to wave it in our faces. Ah well. Sorry to take up
everyones time. I just needed to write my opinion down somewhere, and with the
EQ web boards seeming more communist by the day this seemed a more viable
choice. Take care everyone, and if a levitating druid ever drops a SLN and SOW
on you for no reason, that was me.
