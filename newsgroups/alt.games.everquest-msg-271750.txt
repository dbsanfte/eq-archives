  Agreed.  And with a subject like EQ, it really is easy to bounce from
subject to subject to subject.  Nonlinear games do not lend themselves to
linear FAQs.  But yeah, if you do find the bad FAQ again, please do post
the link.  I'd be interested in seeing it.

    When I took over the FAQ, I expanded it in size by about, oh, I dunno,
I guess five or six times in length.  Of this, I would guess that I wrote
roughly one forth of the new material I added.  I could have very easily
expanded the FAQ to be two or three times longer than it is now.  The
problem with do that, however, is that then the FAQ would be pretty firmly
in novella length.  I think a FAQ is something that should be easily read
in one or two sittings.  Don had the excellent idea of keeping the core FAQ
at the length I set (pretty much) and then adding additional, more in depth
subpages to go into more depth on the various factors of EQ that could use
some expanding.

   The problem is, as I see it, that EQL is going into decline now.  I've
seen Don ask a few times for contributors to add to the FAQ on a couple of
different subjects.  I haven't noticed him getting many bites.  When I took
over the FAQ (about a year ago), when I asked for contributions I did get
them.  Many of the knowledgeable regulars have since quit EQL (as did I),
or moved on to EQII.  Also, back in my day as Keeper of the FAQ there was
much more discussion in this group about the actual gameplay elements of
EQ.  The section called Grouping 101, for example, came from a regular
posting to this group, which I lifted and made some minor editorial changes
to.  Alot of new material that I added to the FAQ came about this way.  I'd
see an informative post, cut'n paste it, then thank in newsgroup the new
contributor for their "submission".  

   Don strikes me as being a bit more diligent a person when it comes to
updating the FAQ than I was.  But he simply has less material to work with,
in terms of community feedback.  I could be wrong, but I doubt if the FAQ
will grow to much beyond its current size.
