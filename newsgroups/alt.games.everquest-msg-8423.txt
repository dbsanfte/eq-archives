I think you're reversing the liable party here. Dangerous world? Heck, train
enough greens on somebody and they'll die. It has nothing to do with a
"dangerous world," it has to do with consideration and taking responsibility
for what you do.

When you're kiting, you are running the possibility of strolling into
another's space, not the other way around. If I'm camping bandits in EK and
somebody kites a griff through the camp that agros me, 'taint *my* error nor
is it *my* place to move on because it's a "dangerous world." If I'm at an
orc camp in EC and some nit-wit drags a few Kodiaks into the camp, he's the
"problem," not me. It's the place of the kiter to be more careful or move
on, as it's not only inconsiderate and rude, it can be downright dangerous.
And he brought the mob to me, not "mother nature."

Anybody who kites a mob into another party that ends up agroing them ought
to be the one to apologize. Anybody who does so and ignores what they did
isn't likely to get helped by me when in trouble. Anybody who not only
refuses to fess up to their error, but responds with "If my kiting nearby is
a danger to you, then you shouldn't be here" goes on the "Never Help, Ever"
list of both myself and my guild.
