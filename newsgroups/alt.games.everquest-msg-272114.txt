Your post makes me feel a little better.... I had noticed pretty
severe video problems, bad enough that I assumed they must be unique
to me.  But if enough people have trouble with the video, they'll have
to fix it.

I am amazed at how bad it is.  It didn't take more then 30 seconds of
being online to see characters with most of their bodies missing.
