That whole petition thing drives me nuts.  Unless the person is playing a
name like 'phuker' or 'coxinmouth' or some equally brilliant name that has
some profanity associated with it.  Why should a person give a rat's ass
about what another picks for their name.

The *only* server that I could see this an issue would be on Firona Vie
(sp?) where it is a suggested role playing server or something.  That is
where all the ex-dnd dice rolling fanatics should be playing and be quite
content in playing name nazi on the side.  For the general populace though,
meh - what's in a name?
