Yep, I just got a troll sk to level 37 and have a cleric dark elf of
innoruk at 38. So far, since my main druid just got 56, I've not
NOTICED a single hell level. To me, on both characters, 30 and 35 were
walks in the park after getting a main from 51 - 55 (I was in level 55
for eons it seemed.. my god) So after this change I'll be going "What
the hell? That was 45?? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? I AM ORGASMING!"

Big fun will be had by my level 11 vah shir shammy too.. since it will
be able to sit and med. After not having a spell book on chars its
hard to get used to playing one with it. Like the other changes, this
one is just about ending frustration. Does not having the spell book
make the game EASIER? No. Does not having the spell book in your face
make the game less frustrating and more fun? YES. 

The same thing is true of newb chars popping up with gear, its going
to happen at a time when if its your first char or first time in that
area you get very frustrated  trying to find your corpse. This doesn't
really make the game "easier" since they'd be dying near where there
corpse was anyway probably, it just makes it less frustrating.

One thing is still missing even with all these changes. Its probably
been one of my biggest sources of frustration for 3 years:

Boats. They still need to be made hella faster or more of them need to
be added. Or they just need to be moving faster after zoning. When its
3 minutes before a boat starts moving after it zones, on both sides,
you get something like 7 minutes or more added to the time a player is
waiting for the boat while the boat is just sitting idle.

The best option I can think of for the boat problem is something on
the order of nexus but for money.  Scenario following:

Freeport dock. Lil gnome guy there saying "take the express to
sister's isle, Boats are for fools!!!" (possibly even out on that rock
in the harbor, and beta neutral of course)  "give me 50 plat and the
passage is yours!" 50 plat, zone. 

Sister's island. Lil wood elf (beta neutral though, corner of island)
same thing with 50 plat to butcher. Butcher, ditto.

The 50 plat would make it so its what someone might charge you for a
tp so a lot of players would not pay it but those going to camp the AC
or to buy mage spells or to kill the dino or to get the druid epic
cyclops certainly would. Timorous deep to the evil area and FV could
especially use this since that boat system is slowest of all.

Like the changes they are doing now such boat changes would not
make the game easier, they'd just accelerate play and make the game
less frustrating. You can spend up to one hour getting to a kunark or
velious area via the boat. I think my longest record was about 50
minutes to overthere dock from  nro and 45 minutes to velious dock
from nro. This is just too long, especially for someone who might only
have 3 hours that evening to play.

So I'm betting changes in boats are next ;)
