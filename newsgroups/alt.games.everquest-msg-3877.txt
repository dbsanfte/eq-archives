hey!

i wonder if anybody else thought of this too...
try to use twinview on a geforce2 card to have 2 monitors
connected... one rendering EQ and the other rendering
the desktop... where you can have a webpage up and
looking at... stuff... (heh) and move the mouse around on the
webpage monitor and then go back to EQ and move
around again...

i have both monitors working... i can drag windows between
both monitors while on the desktop and when rendering a
game to the primary monitor, the desktop stays up and
running on the secondary monitor... but i cannot move
the mouse up to move the webpage around and type stuff in
(sigh).  i would appreciate your time!
