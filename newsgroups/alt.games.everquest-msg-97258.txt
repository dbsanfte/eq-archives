Why? What difference can it possibly make? You're not much further
with L10 then you are with L5.

Oh give me a break. We're not talking about people from DL moving to
Sebilis here. These are L10s. Heck, every class is still capable of
soloing at L10.

In actuality making this time quicker means the players won't have as
much BAD experience they will soon need to unlearn. Is there ANYTHING
you learned as a druid in 1-10 you still use as a tactic at L40? You
aren't kiting, you're still meleeing, your root is beyond useless, and
you heal nearly as well as a cleric (just as well at some levels).
Lowering people's experience at this level isn't a bad thing, its a
good thing.

If you were berated for not being able to play a cleric at *L10*, then
you had other problems besides leveling too fast.

The actual amount less you do at L1-10 will be pretty insignificant in
the long run. How much difference in skill is there between a L51 and
a L50.

Irrelevant, you are still punished the same for doing stupid things.
It just makes it easier to level when you're smart.

That should tell you something - that the stupid people are already
there. Increasing leveling speed at the newbie levels isn't going to
change anything. We're not going to see Sebilis flooded with twits who
got to 55 because L1-10 were faster.

We're getting into chicken little territory again. It just goes to
prove no matter what a MMORPG company does, SOMEONE will whine about
it.

Verant makes it easier to level. "Oh my god all us ubers will be
swamped with noobs!"

Verant makes it harder to level. "Oh my god way to screw everyone
coming into the game!"

Verant doesn't do either. "Oh my god Verant has forgotten about us and
is focussing all their attentio on SWG! Improve this game first
dammit!"

>From experience...  Too fast will create issues.

And you grossly overestimate the effects. The sky is not falling.
