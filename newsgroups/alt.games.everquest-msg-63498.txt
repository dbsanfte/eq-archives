Though on a serious note, I am curious to know the specifications of those
EQ community members computers and if you are concerned whether or not SoL
will operate efficiently on your computer when USING the new character
models.

I will start the thread (remember please be honest, I am really curious as
to the answers, this isn't a d*ck length competition):

PIII 866 (133MHz FSB)
512MB PC133 SDRAM at 2s latency
ATI Rage Fury Pro (32MB RAM [not DDR sigh] 300MHz DAC)
20 GB Maxtor (sorry WD doesnt seem to be what it used to be) 5400 RPM
ATA-100

I suppose those are the only relevent specifications.  I am actually a bit
concerned of running the new character models, although I probably shouldn't
be.  This is the computer I play EQ on, as I am not about to allow myself to
play on the 1.4GHz dual currently serving as my server.  Blah blah blah.

I just want to thank all those that participate ahead of time.  Take care
and see you in SoL.

Jacobson
