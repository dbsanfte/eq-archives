That would be a very poor assumption.  I have never purposely ks'd,
although it has happened twice when I thought I was helping the
person.

I have however been ks'd a few times myself and, although annoying,
not the end of the world.  Hell, not even worth making a big deal out
of it.  The only time I made something out of an in game action was
when someone tried to blatantly lie about already having a camp that I
had been at for almost 30 minutes.  That made for an interesting 15
minutes.

And as for Tiger Woods only playing for money, of course not.  He
plays because he loves it, but he also makes a living at it.  Best of
both worlds.  And regarding the endorsements, golf is how he got the
endorsements.  And I doubt he'd keep them long if he wasn't playing.
Arnold Palmer anyone?  Still around but rarely seen.
