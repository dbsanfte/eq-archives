Let me say this REAL slow so you can understand...


IT    DOES    NOT    MATTER


Did you get that??  It doesn't matter. 

NOTHING JUSTIFIES TERRORISM...

You can sympathize with the Palestinian Terrorists all you want.  You
can spout off that you understand why 9/11 happened..

You can spew all that you want but what you CANNOT say is such
terrorism is JUSTIFIED and ACCEPTABLE because it simply ain't so...

NOTHING, repeat,  NOTHING  justifies terrorism..

As long as the Palestinians specifically target innocent women and
children, anything that Israel does in response, short of terrorism is
justified.

As long as the Palestinians support terrorism, Israel holds the moral,
legal and ethical high ground here.  


>bombing this, bombing that.. the isreali oppression has taken at least 10
>times as many lives as the bombings have!

Perhaps.  But the targets Israel chose were legitimate military
targets. It's a war over there.  The Israelis choose to fight that war
with the established rules of war.  The Palestinians resort to
terrorism.  THAT is the difference.

No matter how you try to justify it, terrorism is WRONG. It is NOT a
legitimate response to ANYTHING.

Would you agree with that statement?? Yes or no???

Then why doesn't the Palestinians use their bombs to go after military
targets??  Why not attack soldier outposts?  Why not use those bombs
and attack military vehicles?

If the Palestinians did that, you wouldn't hear word one from me.

Why don't the Palestinians attack legitimate military targets??  Can
you answer that???

It's called war...  It's a sad thing.. But it's a fact of life.  

But it doesn't justify terrorism.  It doesn't justify the specific
targeting of innocent women and children..

We are discussing the here and now..  

Regardless of any past transgressions, real or imagined, NOTHING
justifies terrorism..

It's a real simple concept. I am amazed that there are actually people
out there who cannot understand such a simple concept.

Son, I don't have to visit the links. I have been there.  I have seen
it first hand.
