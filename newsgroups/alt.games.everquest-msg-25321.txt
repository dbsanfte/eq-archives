I once got in a very nasty fight with a druid about this.  you have the RUN/WALK
button.  Get out of your chair, and run full sprint (as we all do around Norrath)
now stop.  Did you go any further when you stopped running, momentum says yes.
You either slowed down (happens after you take your finger off the run button) or
you stopped moving your legs and probably broke your nose.  If you switch to
WALK, you can cast as soon as you take your finger off the run button.  I know
this sounds strange, but if you are camping an area, wether watching for a POP or
waiting for someone to pull something to you, try turning RUN off, you will
almost never have the intterupt message from movement.  So long as you are not
worried about getting trained, your fights will go much faster this way as you
won't have any of those interruptions.

Even as my enchanter I normlly walk.  Yes I might get hit once or twice, but I
never interrupt my own mezzes (unless I mezz myself...)
