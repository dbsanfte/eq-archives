The coffin needed for the lesser summon corpse is really cheap.  Only about
1p. If there are no Necro's in Qeynos, you are pretty close to Paineel and
you could head that way and see if you could get some help.

Also, do a check in the zone to make sure the corpse is actually there.
(I'm sorry I forgot how to do this-maybe someone else can help) That should
tell you if it is gone or if you just can't find it.

Sure wish I was on your server I have a level 12 Necro sitting in the sewers
right now.-Good Luck
