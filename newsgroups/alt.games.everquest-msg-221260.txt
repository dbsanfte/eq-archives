And of course I've never grouped with any of those classes.   Yep, just my
rogue and my tank, out duoing, every time.

While the situation you present, nerfing knight classes so that they can
only hold aggro using high mana cost spells, such that they cannot maintain
perfect aggro for an entire fight even with KEI on, would increase a
warriors relative desirability for groups...  I don't think it's the best
way to go.   I'd prefer to get out of the whole situation without nerfing
knights at all.

I'd like to see all three classes have something special and different that
they can bring to a group.

Then why did you suggest it?

Assuming, of course, that that was a suggestion.   Since, as you admitted,
it's not true now, I can only assume it is a description of the situation
you want to be true.

Rogues don't pull good alone.   But a rogue in combination with a feign
death puller is an incredibly powerful pulling team.

If, after 65 levels,  "wait until the mob is at 80% to nuke" is the sum
total of your knowledge of aggro control....  thank you, you've just
illustrated my point perfectly.
