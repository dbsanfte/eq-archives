Hahaha, unfortunately no, I'm on FV server. I remember one of my
first times on the boat when a huge cyclops ran amuck on deck and started
slaughtering people left and right. I ran off the boat onto the deck and to
the
shore only to be attacked by some other guy ( haven't really been there
since).
While running from him I ran back to the boat and the cyclops finished me
off.
To make things worse, I died on the boat and it carried my corpse to the
zone
line then dumped it in the middle of the ocean.

Needless to say it took a GM 2 hours to get back to me and get the corpse!
