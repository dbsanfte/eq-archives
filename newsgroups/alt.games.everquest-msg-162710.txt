	Here's my opinion on the article in general. First off I never knew 
ShowEQ or whatever it is existed. Now that I know what it does I can 
easily state that I am against a program like that. I am a level 55 ENC 
that has been around since Aug. of 1999. I don't play everyday and when 
I do play its usually for 2-4 hours. It takes a lot of time and effort 
to build a character up from scratch and level him/her without an 
experienced player to stop and assist you with questions or something 
else. Its a big accomplishment in a way to reach a high level, gain or 
make strong armor, and complete long tedious quest. These 
accomplishments are insignificant when someone achieves them in half the 
time it took you to get them because that person is cheating and no one 
knows about it.
	The solution to this problem is pretty simple in my opinion. Rather than 
Verant banning these people they should use them to discourage others 
from using ShowEQ. Today in online gaming of any sort when someone 
stoops low enough to cheat a couple things can sometimes be implied 
about that person.
1. They want to be high on the social ladder amongst the players because 
they make themselves seem to be better.
2. Winning is everything even if it isn't fun because that person 
trivialized the difficulty of the game to help them self.
3. The person is power hungry.

  There are definitely other reasons, but that's all I could think of 
for now. Anyhow if that ratio in the article is or close to being right 
about 1 out of 10 players using ShowEQ then this is what should be done. 
Since Verant can now find out who's using it they should label the 50+ 
characters of the account with a mark, abbreviated phrase, color change 
in the name displayed above the head, or anything else that could be 
obvious for another player to notice it. Keeping the reasons why someone 
would cheat in mind this would be very bad. The person loses social 
status with other players and level/quest/skills can not be safely 
assumed that they earned them.
	Last and I think most important lose though is the ability to group and 
guild. An uber guild even though they might already have a bad 
reputation for some reason would not allow a cheater in the guild due to 
the fact they would want to avoid the confrontation with other large 
guilds of actually cheating the same applies to a group as well. Its 
kind of easy to assume that a cheater would receive negative responses 
from the players.....just look at the "attention" people already get 
when they are caught scamming, KSing, training, and waking the sleeper. 
Well there's my opinion on what verant should do.
