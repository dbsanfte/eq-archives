I have a suggestion for you,

you could do the following:

Get a list of all the files installed by the Kunark expansion (someone could
post here, or you could have a friend mail them to you).  Create a file in
notepad, and rename it to this new filename.  When you patch, run the "Full
Check" patch, and it'll verify that your files are corrupted, and
re-download them onto your computer, and voila, u r sorted.

However - this will take a long time if you're on dial-up :)
