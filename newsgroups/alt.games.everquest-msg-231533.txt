I think it should be on that gnome in PoK in his inventory right next to
FoT.
"That will be 200 platinum pieces for the spell Elemental Siphon."  If it's
an Ancient spell, it might as well not be in the game from my perspective.
I think making this a group buff gets away from the vision of a mage, but
I'll take it and just hope they increase the duration if it's group.  I do
not want to swap out spells every 6 minutes for this.  Doling out rods is
enough for me, I don't need people telling me that Siphon is fading every
few minutes.

Snare is nice, particularly in LDoN.  Stuns - the melees in my normal group
never even notice them on the rare occasions I get to use the air pet
because the mobs get slowed pretty quickly.  This would be a lot more useful
if I could tell the pet when to stun - that would help interrupt the
healers.  All in all, I'd trade the snare and stun for the word "great"
instead of "decent" in front of "DPS".
