Thanks everyone for all the great tips.  It helped a lot, and here's what
happened.  I gave up on the hand-to-hand thing for now, I really only wanted
to practice for those rare (yeah right) occasions in which I find myself
dead and rather vulnerable.  I just thought it might be handy (no pun
intended)

But I did decide to up those pick pocket skills.  I'm in Kelethin right now,
an they have a serious Orc infestation her.  They dont really bother me
anymore, so I thought they might make good practice as they do have actual
pockets (I think) I guess I had practiced more than I thought, because the
first up message I got said I was at 23.  I kept working those Orcs, with
the added bonus of finding CB belts when they got mad and I had to kill
them.  The pawns stand really still and it takes a while for them to figure
out that I am there.  Centurions are a little faster on the uptake.

I also tried hiding and picking and of course everytime I picked, I became
unhidden, but I then quickly rehid and I was able to spend a lot of time
standing behind an Oracle without him going aggro on me.  I only did this
for a coupla hours and by the end of the nite, my skill was up to 53.  I
think my max right now is 65, so that's pretty good and I actually made a
little money.

Ok, so now I have a coupla new questions;
1. Does the number of undected picks go up as your skills go up, or is is
this dependent on the MOBs level, maybe intelligence or something?
2. Are you sure the loot is the same that would have been taken by a party?
I was getting a few silvers off Orcs and I can't remember ever looting
silvers off Orcs?
3. Usually I just kept picking and picking the same Orc til he aggro'd and
then I killed him.  If I went from one Orc to the other 1 pick each, then
made the rounds again, would they still aggro on the 2nd or 3rd pick or
would each one be like the first pick?  Doesn't apply here, but when I try
bigger game it would be nice to know.


Ok when I was fighting I did see a parry message.  I guess I just didn't
noticed them before.

4. Is there a way to speed up backstab practice?  I have been using it every
chance I get since 10th level and it's still feeble.  I know that I can use
it in head on confrontations for an extra hit, but do I still get skill
increase for that, or only from behind?

5.  If I can increase safe-fall by falling down, why can't I increase Sense
Heading by getting lost?  (just kidding)

Sounds like dual wield is going to be a lot of fun!  If i ever get there.
So far the road to 13th level has been pretty slow. No, that would be an
exaggeration, it has been dead.  Oh well

Thanks Again
