Thanks Dan, that may come in handy - but it would have to be a damn good
deal or a much needed item.

I tend to do /baz item searches from the middle of the bazaar, and if I get
a few hits I then right click on the trader in question. If the resulting
direction appears to one of the bank clusters I then try another trader even
if a bit more expensive.

I regularily pay up to 10% more for items just for the luxury of knowing the
proceeds are not going to wanker...
