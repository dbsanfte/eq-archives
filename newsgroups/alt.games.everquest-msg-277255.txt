That is a result of "herd mentality" (in a grouping game this isn't
necessarily derogatory) rather than any lack of content.  There are dozens
of spots for all level ranges with decent experience and loot in EQ, the
vast majority of them unused.

And the day after EQ came out none of the players were at the high end.  A
year later however...

I am sure the game companies wish all players had the view that "I haven't
run out of stuff to do, so there's plenty of content."  Rather
self-centered, but definitely favorable for the game companies.

You're again confusing the results of herd mentality with an indication, of
any sort, about the amount of content.  Even in the Kunark era, and
assuming arguendo that only the latest expansion's loot and experience
would be worthwhile, Overthere, Dalnir's Crypt, Firiona Vie, Droga (or
Nurga, I never remember which is which), and the rest of the Frontier
Mountains zone itself all offered comparable experience/loot at that level
range.
