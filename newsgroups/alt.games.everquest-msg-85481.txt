    Haggling is one thing. But ALWAYS offering less than asked for, no
matter what the price, begins to insult the auctioneer. On the low-end stuff
Dan gave me to sell I've been pricing close to vendor prices on stuff, like
10 pp on Chitin Shell Armour. And yet I'll still get tells trying to shave
one pp off the price from people who are twinked. Tells from the same people
who will then tell me "LOL, as if it's worth that much!" Which is odd,
seeing as I'll sell it for that much half an hour later. :-)
