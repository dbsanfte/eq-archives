I'll third this for exactly the same reasons.  Only times I have been decent
as a tank with my ranger is when I use a good shield to get my AC up and the
group is able to drop the mob quickly. Everytime I have been the group
healer, I go oom if a ranger draws aggro. I think bards with decent
equipment make better tanks.
