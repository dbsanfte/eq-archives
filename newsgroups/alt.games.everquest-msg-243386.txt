I've done it exactly twice. I guess if you have literally millions of 
plat wasting away in your bank, sure. But gathering and turning in 
random crap to try to get a decent amount of tribute that will last a 
useful amount of time at FT5 is a royal PITA. Combined with the fact 
that you can't modify or shut it off when not using it made it useless 
IMO and I haven't been back.
