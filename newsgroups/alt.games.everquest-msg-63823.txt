So are you really that dense, or do you just like to ignore the truth?
EQ is going strong and will go strong until something better comes
along. They get away with terrible customer service and what appears
to be the most laughable system administration I have ever heard of in
a major company. They get away with it because they don't have
competition enough. They also have a flat monthly fee, so they don't
care about uptime. If there was a hourly charge, the extended outages
would have accounts beating on systems people. Thats real world MIS,
which I wish Verant would follow. Just because they aren't going out
of business doesn't mean that they are not doing a crappy job at
something. Its a good game. They do a good job of game design. The MIS
people don't seem to estimate well, and certainly don't have a good
track record testing. If you are ahppy with it, thats fine. I have
every right to complain because I know it can be done much better.

Let me ask you this. Do you think that verant loses customers due to
their poor customer service? I they had good MIS and customer service
do you think it might be 500,000+ and the Luclin bump? The latter is
my opinion.
