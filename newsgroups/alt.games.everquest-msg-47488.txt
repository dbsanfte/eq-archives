Helps to be an enchanter, and a low level one so that the raid in place can
afford to put you lowest on the totem pole as far as loot priority.

I doubt this would work as well for most other classes. Especially high
population ones like warriors who have drops up there. Usually no shortage
of people going up, and they won't like extra competition for the drops.
