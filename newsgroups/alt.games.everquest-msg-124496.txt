I'd like to thank those who've answered my query for their suggestions.

As it stands I think I've managed to sort it out using the "kill EQ task 
and then sort NIS out" approach, and so far I haven't had any further 
problems.  I have to confess I'm no networking expert and I don't pretend 
to be completely familiar with IPs and TCPs and ports and all that jiggery-
pokery, but I am quite interested so I'm trying to learn all I can.

And I'm going to keep hold of your answers 'cos I've no doubt I'll hit more 
problems later on...  :o)

Thanks again
