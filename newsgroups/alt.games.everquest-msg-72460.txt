Smaller sized, but pretty high level.  One of the reasons for our rather
diverse, and perhaps unbalanced class makeup is that we started out (and still
are) going for a guild full of good friends, not "a guild capable of killing
ubermobs"... The original UO newsgroup refugee guild.   We've been playing
together for so long though that we're now rising to higher levels.  We're by
no means one of the uberguilds, but not bad.

To give an idea of how much...  Hmm... We're strong enough to do ToV, Halls of
Testing at least, and have done so.   We've launched raids that have killed
Faydear without a death (including the enchanter that tashed), and have for
many months been able to do Hate and Fear with ease, including the golems.
Our last Chardok raid (in the new and improved higher level Chardok) was a big
success.  Without outside help, we killed the King without a death, the Queen
with only a few deaths, and bum rushed the Prince room and AE'ed them to
death, again without losing one person.   With help we have killed Talendor
and Gorenaire.

Maybe it varies by servers, but on E'ci at least, I still see a great deal of
high level rangers.   Of our rangers, one is level 60.   I believe one is 57,
but he might be 56 still.  Three are 55 to 56.  One is 54, two in the low
50's, one is 45, and the final one is 25.  With the exception of the two pre
50's, all of them have Swiftwind, and three of them have both epics.  Most of
the ones over 54 are active.  The low 50's ones seem to me to be more casual
players.
