    I'm not sure, so I'm unwilling to take the chance. There's one warrior
on our server, Tenon, who can go take screenshots of himself and his buddy
Trakanon standing together because of pre-Kunark faction plusses he took.
And certainly nobody running bard mail before Kunark realized that the Ring
of Scale hits would make them KOS to Gorenaire in Dreadlands. What I do know
is the elemental mobs there hate non-Brell worshippers, and won't attack us
Brell folks. So I ain't messing with it.

    Stuff in Mischief is supposedly on a faction that is decreased by
killing the bandits in GFay. Not that I'm likely to ever be in a position to
test it.
