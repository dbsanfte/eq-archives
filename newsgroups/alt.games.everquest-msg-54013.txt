you can raise 1HB in the off hand but it will be slow, you can only raise
skills against blue mobs. good trick unless it has been nerfed get a friend
who can summon a pet that is blue to you (preferably Not an Enchanter can
not control the pet) get 2 low damage fast 1hb weapons go to any PVP zone
and fight the pet you will increase combat skills when the you or the pet
is low on health take a break and heal.
