Not sure whose fault this one is, but it was annoying, so time to vent.  CS
was camped solidly, and I'd cleaned out all the good things in my EW hunting
ground, so decided to check out Jaggedpine.  On the way, checked Hadden, and
he was up.  I've got an FBE, but figured I'd kill him anyway...if one
dropped, surely someone from my guild would come loot it.

There was an AFK warrior standing in front of Hadden, so I waited a couple
minutes, but she didn't come back, so I nuked Hadden, and indeed there was
an FBE.  I announced it in guildchat, but no one was interested.  (This is a
guild where we've had people drown on Kedge raids *BEFORE* zoning into
Kedge, so you'd think people would jump at an EB item).  Anyway, someone
suggests I have a twink loot it.

So, I log back to char selection screen, so none of my other chars on that
account are near by, and so go back to the login screen, and log into the
second account, where I've got a 20 druid.  Druid quickly mems his port to
Surefell Glade, and ports....and I get a blue screen, with some message
about a problem with my video, and Windows is shutting down to prevent
hardware damage.

I've only ever seen this in EQ, so my first impulse is to bitch at Verant
for crashing Windows.  On the other hand, this is XP, which should not
crash, no matter what an application does, so maybe Microsoft is who I
should bitch at.  However, drives can bring down even the best system...so
maybe NVidia is to blame?

So Windows reboots, and I get back into EQ...which takes waaaaaay too
long--so I'm bitching at Verant (come on, Verant...have a timestamp that
tells when the patch information on the patch server last changed, so the
patch client can just check the time, and no that there hasn't been a patch
since it last ran, and skip the slow download of all the patch information).

Ported to SFG, ran to Qeynos Hills, and the corpse had poofed, presumably
taking the FBE with it, unless some newbie happened to have wandered by in
time and looted it.

So, anyway, I'm pissed at one or more of {Verant, Microsoft, NVidia}, but
I'm not sure which. :-)
