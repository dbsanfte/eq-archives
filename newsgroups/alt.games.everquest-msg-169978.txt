Been there...done that. :-)

At those levels/encounters it becomes nearly impossible to roleplay.
Play de-evolves into short bursts of communication (CH
INC!...Assisting xyz...30secs left Defensive....etc), and timing
button presses on the keyboard or mouse. Victory becomes a matter of
each cog in the "raid-machine" turning in unison with no glitches. It
can be fun, exciting and very rewarding if that is the type of play
you enjoy.

Just not my thing. 

Enjoy the highend game (if that is your thing). I wish you all the fun
and success in the world. :-)
