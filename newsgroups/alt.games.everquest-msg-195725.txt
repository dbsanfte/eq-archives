Which is exactly what Newshound is claiming, that a soloing cleric can do 
better soloing than grouping.  At level 51, that cleric could be in one of 
the Tier 1 PoP zones, getting far more xp in a group than he could soloing 
anywhere prePoP.

Actually, you come out 2% ahead then.

Won't dispute that for a druid.  For us non quad kiting capable types 
though...

I find shaman with warrior or monk or ranger is quite effective as well.  I 
still think that once you are high enough level though that going to tier 1 
PoP zones will be better than soloing much of anywhere else.  Of course, if 
you can quad in PoP, then you get the best of both worlds.  Most of us have 
to either group in PoP, or slowly kill one mob at a time.  I know that I 
can get far more xp in a full group in PoP than I can soloing.
