Well, it *is* stupid. Honestly, it is about as fun to watch as most 
flamewars to me. I have better things to do than watch a program that 
has people on an island whinging about starving as all they were given 
to eat was rice, and one sauce pan and a knife. Bloody heck, take the 
saucepan and seawater, boil off the water to collect the salt. there, 
flavoring for the rice. Go wading in those stupid tidepools for fish and 
crustaceans, when the tide is out it *is* 'fishing in a barrel' There, 
protein to flavor the rice. You are camped next to a veritable 
plantation of coconut palms. Yes there ar a few toxic plants, but in 
general coconuts aren't one of them. Dessert=) even if the coconuts are 
green, they are used in malaysian cooking chopped up and oddly enough 
cooked with rice.

Honetly, I think if they were accidently locked in a candy store they 
would complain there was only candy and no pizza to eat...
