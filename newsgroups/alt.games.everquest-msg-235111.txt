In the sense that it can take weeks/months to obtain, and the moment
you find an upgrade it has absolutely no utility. 

You can't sell it, you can't twink it, you can't turn it in for
favour, you can't turn it in as part of a quest, you can't even melt
it down for a lump of ore.

I'm not suggesting that no drop items shouldn't be no drop, but its a
joke that SOE doesn't allow you to do anything with them at all...
particularly given all the possibilities.
