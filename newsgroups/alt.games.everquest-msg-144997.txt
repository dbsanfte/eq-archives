Wouldn't this be the exact type of person who would be more likely to 
commit a "hate" crime against a gay person?

Yes.

Well if this is true then its news to me, but its irrelevant anyway. Its 
how they are perceived by a potential "hate" criminal which is relevant. 
If this person is killed because the killer thought he was gay, then its 
still a hate crime whether he is actually gay or not.

Read the hate crime statute again.

If someone is attacked because they are perceived to be gay due to the 
clothes they wear, then clothing is most definitely relevant.

He is being attacked because the clothes he wears leads the attacker to 
assume he is gay, and therefore attack him based on that assumption.

How many "hate" crimes against gays do you think there are where the 
attacker decides he must have 100% conclusive evidence the victim is 
actually gay? There have been quite a few incidences that I know of 
personally where people I know have been attacked because they have been 
perceived to be gay, but are actually strictly heterosexual.
