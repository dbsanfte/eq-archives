}level 40, with int of about 140 (I customized chr).

Othershad some good answers to this question, but let's get to the nub of 
the crux of the matter here:

You are -not- going to master Jewelcraft with 140 int are you?  What a 
waste of money!

I usually have about 210 int 195 cha buffed... I can get to 255 int for 
serious tradeskill work tho. :)

And as the the effectiveness of Cha... It definitely does one thing.  It 
lowers merchant prices.  Course ya only need about 120 for that, but 
still.
