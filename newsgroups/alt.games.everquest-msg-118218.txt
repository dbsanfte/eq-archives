In all fairness, DT, the croc's are a *slightly* different story than
the wisps. For the evils in the area, it's often nice if people leave
the bodies with "a chunk of meat" on them so the evils can scavenge a
living far from their home vendors. My troll lived on Croc meat and
Desert Madman water for at least five levels and took several stacks
with him when he moved up to highpass, back in the day.
