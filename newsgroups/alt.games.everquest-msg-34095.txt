Hmmm, if you really wanna see the Western Wastes, you MAY be able to
do so without a wizard's help, if there is a group killing the two
seahorses guarding the enterence to the vertical tunnel.  If the
seahorses are engaged, just swim in as fast as you can, then swim
vertically when the tunnel opens up.  Once you get to the top of the
tube, go over the waterfall, get out of the water in the corner, and
sneak/hide your way to WW zone.  Of course there is also supposed to
be some bug where if you sit directly in the corner as you come in
from CS, and camp out and in three times, you will end up at the WW
zone line.  I don't know this from firsthand experience, but every
time I die trying to swim past the seahorses, someone always sends me
a tell mentioning the camp trick.
