Or... add back in a bard.  Early on you get Selo's speed (sure not the
same as porting, but a lot quicker than lvl 29 too...).  Bard's also
give buffs, debuffs, charm, fear, etc..  Not perfect or the best at
any - but definitely will fill any gap you have.  Oh, and let's not
forget the first mana song is now at lvl 20.
