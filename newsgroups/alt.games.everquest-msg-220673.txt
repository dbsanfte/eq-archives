Well, if you have stopped doing anything annoying, and someone
with Taunt skill has successfully taunted, then you don't have
aggro anymore.  Taunt is such a lame skill that even maxed out it
only works one time in three, though, and there's no visual
confirmation when it does.  Still, taunt several times and you
almost certainly don't have aggro on the squeak toy, er, I mean
Chanter anymore.

The difference is that -if- the trick works (seems to be some
doubt about this) then you'd know when the taunt finally does
work, which may be first time, second time, third time... rarely
takes more than that it seems.  If you are in the habit of
taunting before breaking mez, then this would cut in half the
average time before waking the mob (ie to one and a half taunt
cycles), since you'll no longer have to taunt 3 times just to be
sure.
