Ah, but the mob can and *did* get me on some occasions. I was not "under
the bridge" as in the case of <conquest>'s alleged cleric abuse. It just
took him longer. I see no basis for your argument yet, but you're
generally a reliable source, so let's read on.

I was in no means in an upset or hostile mindset when I phrased that
question, so I'm obviously a bit confused about that, but if you saw it
that way, then I apologize in advance if any offense was taken. It was
just a hypothetical situation relating to the current topic asking for
your opinion.

And as I pointed out repeatedly, if all you have to offer is "Verant
says so. Goodbye." then thats' fine. I'm not going to be able to change
those rules any more than <Conquest> could, even if I wanted to.
Basically I was wondering if others could offer a rationale for having
some of them in place. So far, I see you can't, but are also going to
follow the rules, so all's well in the world of Norrath. <g>

Again, I'm certainly not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but could you
humor me by backing up your decisions with some sort of explanation
rather than "all pretty much wrong" and "why" after each possible
explanation I could think of in the case of a GM observing this scenario
and acting on it?

It was just a guess. I'm as confused as you seem to be as to "why" or
what other option I would be offered.

(other possible hypothetical answers from GM snipped.)

I very clearly realize that I would be "exploiting" *In The Opinion Of
Verant* (which is the only one that matters in Norrath, and by which we
shall abide)  We've still never gotten down to the "why?" of it, nor do
I think we shall in this thread.

Ok. You're the GM. You've ruled I can't hunt mino's from that spot, so I
won't. But before I go, could you humor me and tell me why as I leave
for my new hunting spot? No? 
/em sighs, clearly disappointed.

> That's how you do it right... 

Ummmm back up for the mentally challenged of us in the crowd. *How* do I
"do it right" again? Hunt from a different spot? Ok. I will. But so I
don't make the same mistake in a different zone and cause more trouble,
why? And how will I know? Eh? Nothing?
/em sighs, deeply disappointed.

> I suggest that <you> do a little paying attention. 

And now it's *my* turn to say, "I don't know where this hostility is
coming from, Biz. I'm only asking a very simple question of "why" which
you've thus far failed to answer. We all know it's policy, and we all
know the rules. (most of us anyway). But will you step up to bat and
offer a rationale to justify their existance in this case, since it
applies to many others?

Pardon the slightly increasing rancor, but did you read *any* of the
previous posts? The Mino can, could, and DID get me. It just took him a
little longer.

Ah. Well, as stated originally, that's a perfectly acceptable answer.
You don't know either, but it's the rules and we'll all follow them. I
already do follow them, as I wish to keep playing. Just good to know
that more experienced players are as completely befuddled as to why the
rules are in place as I am. :-)

See above. You're a good Norrath citizen, Biz. you're to be commended,
even though you VERY quickly took a civil discussion of game rules and
chose to turn it into an excuse to be abusive to someone defending a
position that you can't come up with a rationale for.
