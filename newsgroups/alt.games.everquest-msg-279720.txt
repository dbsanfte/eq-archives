I like being able to see more of what's around me, but I find it
very hard to navigate in 3rd person, especially if I'm in melee
and am trying to maneuver to be next to the mob AND facing it.
(Casters don't have this issue as much because they don't need to
be facing their target.)

What I've done is set up one of the "user defined camera" angles
(two of the cameras that you find if you hit F9 repeatedly are the
two user-defined cameras) to be a wide pullback view, and then
used the Keys options window (alt+O, Keys, category: Camera) so
I have a key combination that switches me to that view.  (I use
ctrl+F9 for first person view, shift+F9 for overhead, ctrl+shift+F9
for the pullback view.)  So I can switch to the wide view to see
what's around me and switch back quickly if I need to navigate.

I also use the pullback view when pulling.  Switch to wide view,
use alt+left/right arrows to spin the view around so I can see
what's chasing me.
