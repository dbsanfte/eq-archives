Yes, same as if you clicked your song bar. Then just wait a second and
click the Melody Macro you want to use.  If you are a low-level
player, don't try to do too many songs in a melody, or it gets
interrupted all the time.  At 27, I find I like to stick to 3 songs at
most in a melody, as that seems pretty dependable.  I can push it to
4, but the interrupts get annoying, heh.

Just stop songs with a click rather than by typing, as that way is
faster.
