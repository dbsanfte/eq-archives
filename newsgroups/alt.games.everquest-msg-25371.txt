    The #&^%# game engine counts z-axis movement, too. You know how the
character kneels when bandaging? Yup, that animation can count as enough
movement to disrupt bandaging - especially when you're chain-bandaging, and
trying to hit the BW button as fast as possible.

    It's one of my biggest complaints about playing a hybrid, or any
character that melees and casts - the animation for swinging your weapon can
interrupt your casting. It can get REALLY bad for a fatty - my old TSK would
self-interrupt four or five times in a row, even if the mob missed all of
its attacks, if I wasn't timing my casts at the correct part of the
"swinging big two handed weapon" animation.
