Temp at those low levels is nonsense,had no problem
to keep everyone alive without it before I got it at 44.
And now at  57 I only give it (or Druid skin/symbol combo)
to make my group members feel better,using heal over time
mostly I dont care if the tank has 3200 hps or 4000.
Sometimes I meet tank types in pickupgroups who are that
spoiled that they go back to PoK to grab a Virtue between
adventures.  *shakes head*
