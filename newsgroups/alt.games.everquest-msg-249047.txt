I wouldn't speak to new content; I'd speak to current content, the
problems attendant thereto, and what I and others see as possible
solutions.

The problem with the uberguilds is that they can and do twink out
their new characters and go hammering through the existing material
until they get back up to their lofty levels, without actually dealing
with the problems at the lower levels.

If you use a howitzer, any APC is a trivial problem.  But if you use a
.303, an APC is a *big* problem.  They want a bigger howitzer.  I'd
just like a couple of rifle grenades.

You know what one of my biggest problems has been recently?  It used
to be that the Paineel newbie zone was an excellent place to get snake
eggs for baking.  It isn't, anymore.  There's about 7 mobs wandering
around.  However, if you listen carefully, you can hear a *lot* of
noise at a couple of points in the zone.  I brought in my 30 Druid and
PB AoE'ed at those points.  Got 5 critters dead fast.  Did it again
and again and suddenly there were creatures all over the newbie zone.
