And in the same vein, also (c) T.L.:

I ache for the touch of your lips, dear,
But much more for the touch of your whips, dear.
You can raise welts, like nobody else,
As we dance to the Masochism Tango!


I've long since memorized "Poisoning Pigeons in the Park", "Who's
Next", "Bright College Days" (I use this one to remember how to make a
martini), "A Christmas Carol", and bits of various others.  I've even
memorized the first sentence of "The Elements".
