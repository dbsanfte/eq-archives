That is one view. Another is that since the combatants are supported
with civilian dollars and votes, there is no such thing as an
innocent. Cultural difference. Those that really are innocent (babies
etc) are, according to this mindset, let down by their guardians.

Who's to say which is more right.

I don't say the arabs are more right than Israel. I do say that Israel
is using the US support to be far less accomodating than they
otherwise would have been. By now its probably long past too late for
them to ever get along. But why should Israel be OUR problem....

Wonder how fast Israel would agree to a separate Palestinian state if
they had no assurances or help from the US? They're like the smug
little brother hiding behind their big older brother and throwing
rocks while giving everyone else the Nelson Muntz "Haw haw!"
