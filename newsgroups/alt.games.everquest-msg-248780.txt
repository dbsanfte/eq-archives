While its certainly cute to quote statements out of context, i did not
make a blanket statement you posted above, it was a conditional of the

It might have been badly punctuated given the ... though. Noted, and
sorry if you felt i inferred you needed to learn more about your craft

cannot see that orig EQ will be dead in a couple years whether or not
EQ2 comes out due to advances in technology.

As per you being a software engineer.. that was established by you
here...
