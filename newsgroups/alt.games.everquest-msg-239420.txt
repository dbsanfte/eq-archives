*Shrug* if it -is- a hacked account, I would feel badly about that, but I 
don't have any way to track down the true owner.  The true owner can 
always snag it back, though, by going here:

Well, if that's the case, he'd be the proud new owner of a female level 4 
woodelf bard on FV server, twinked out with an ornate electrum chain 
tunic, cloth pants, and a rusty scimitar!  Ooh, the uberitude!

}just as curious.... the point that this was posted by the same guy who

}like duplicate?), and no further comments from either him or the op of
}this thread.... 
}I sure wouldn't leave anything of value on any of the characters.

Yea, if he's really only made it to level 11 on his own, he can sell that 
shirt to a merchant for 25pp, a veritable fortune!  Lot of effort to go to 
to make that much.

I have 5 accounts now, and have let three go inactive.  It will be no 
problem to keep this one as disposable...  All I really wanted it for was 
to have a forager and corpsefinder on FV.  I'll keep y'all posted if 
anything dire happens to it.  

Of course, now that I have a completely disposable account that isn't tied 
to me by credit card number or address or anything, well, except this 
post, it's quite tempting to experiment with all these macro programs and 
showeq I keep hearing about, so I may manage to get it banned all by my 
little own self. :)

I'd probably just macro it to forage while I'm at work, though.  I want 
some veggies!
