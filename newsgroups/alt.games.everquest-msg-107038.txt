DL was the first time I was asked by the party to do the pulling (im an
enchanter). Sounds crazy? Well it worked... either the druid snared or the
tanks got the agro quick, and then I was free to push the pace, chain
pulling muahahaha. No sitting around on my butt fm any more. Even our cleric
with clarity was running out of mana from so many pulls. Its a shame so many
of the more common pulling classes are brain dead.
