Oh, it makes a difference allright, I didn't deny that.  But it's a
smaller difference proportionate to level than later on.  Given that
STR gear would be difficult for a Warrior to <avoid> while STA gear
is harder to come up with, I'd say go for STA with any Warrior (and
even more so with a PAL/SHD), especially if you're a race without a
high base STA.

Under L10 or so it's goofy, there seems to be a hard minimum around
1 HP / 5 STA.  And right around L30 there's a big jump in HP, which
I've assumed was due to a change in the STA formula being used, since
in my Warriors' teens it was certainly less than 1 HP per 10 STA per
level.  If I think of it in-game I can check with STA gear on L1,
L25, L26, and L32 today, with more samples as my current Warrior on
Test (the L26) levels up.

For a L51 to L55 Paladin it's been 1 HP per 13 STA per level, I never
checked the numbers when Kaev was lower level tho.
