Gonna wait for tomorrows patch to decide to cancel my account. After the
latest patch, I was able to enter world but when I zoned I crashed to the
desktop. Since then whenever I try to enter world, I crash to the desktop. I
shouldn't have to jump through a whole bunch of loops just to play this
game. So we'll see tomorrow.
