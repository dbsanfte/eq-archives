Yeah I get that too. :p I know how you feel, I used to play a game
called Nexus: Kingdom of the Wind which was a nice game if you like to
roleplay, which I didn't. I came back after a while of now playing
(keep in mind this game has an average of 800 people online, 1 server
total) and all my characters were gone. They allow people to download
the game and create newbies for free, but they could just delete the
newbies instead of everyone who hasn't paid up their protection money
for their damn characters. EQ has a lot more people playing but they
can't have newbie spam characters because you have to spend money
before you can even log into a server. There is no reason to delete
characters unless the damn game goes bankrupt, filling up a huge
server HD does not cost them more money, they don't use the same HD's
to hold the zone info and game info as they do to hold the character
info so in they end they just clear out character files probably in
the hopes that being that the high level end of the game is very
boring so starting over might addict them to the game again. That's
the only thing I can figure because I can tell you from experience,
when my characters are gone that game loses my buisness for good after
working on them so long. With so many MMORPGs coming out when they
find their characters are gone they will goto DAoC, AO, UltimaOnline,
AC2 and all the rest plus any of the other new ones I failed to
mention because there are so damn many. If you decide to play DAoC by
the way to try something different I'll be Liveye a Wizard on the
Merlin server when I get my copy. Good luck to you...
