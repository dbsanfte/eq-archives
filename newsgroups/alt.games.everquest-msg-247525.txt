    I use the punchy topic because people are about 2x more likely to read
and respond than to "my rant of the month" or something boring. As to the
"shut up and admit it" line, more of the same really. Hook people early and
make them read.

    Nothing to do with my actual attitude towards discussion.

    Well, I read your post. You accused me of being a troll, flat out
dissagreed with everything I said, giving no particular reasons, which
doesn't leave much room for argument, and then provided two paragraphs about
mudflation etc that I completely agree with. I have no idea how to respond
to a post like that, really.

cheers,
James
