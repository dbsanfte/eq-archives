I have also seen 50-80pp as a price for these.  I do think that due to the
level of the brewer, this is a fair price.  This item is used for 2 quest
that I know of. A ranger quest requiring 3 cask and a rogue quest requiring
1 cask.  I have done the rogue quest and camped the brewer and sold the
extra casks I received for 50-60pp.  The rogue quest is for the burning
rapier (no drop) which is a fair mid-level piercer for the offhand. Many
rogues do not do this quest until they are 50+ because I have read that the
burning rapier is a required (maybe not anymore?) item to get the rogue
epic, the Ragebringer.

So... A very high level rogue, going for his epic Ragebringer, and who does
not have the no drop burning rapier, would be forced to do that quest as
well.  He probably wont want to camp a low level mob in blackburrow for 8-12
hours for this sub-subquest.  This means that a plat rich high rogue could
pay 500pp-1000pp or whatever to get a cask!  Not an everyday occurance
though!
