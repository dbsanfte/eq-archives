Reroll as an Iksar. Regen is the best racial attribute for a Necro.
And faction doesn't mean anything anymore with PoP. You won't have to
worry about this until you get Call of Bones at 34th lvl. Don't get
KEI, learn how to use and love the dark pact line of spells.

Be warned, if you ask about KEI on their boards, you will be flamed.
