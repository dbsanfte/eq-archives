I noticed that my offense -does- go up even if I don't hit melee..in
fact my offense once went up when I was playing around with
what I'll call "thornbush".... DS tanking in treeform.

On the other hand, my defense goes up too... and I almost
-never- get hit without both my DS on.

Hmm, haven't payed attention, it is possible that I haven't gotten
a raise with the level 19 DS's...  I know for a fact that
my DS went up fine with both the lower level DS's on, and
that my defense also went up with level 44 DS PL buffage on.

Could Barbcoat be the culprit?  Or is the problem just
an illusion?
