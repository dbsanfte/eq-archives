I'm playing Kerriana a female half elf Druid on Blackburrow, currently level 
13
My husband is playing Tanndor, a barbarian crusader on Blackburrow, 13 as 
well

We're both current (albiet not frequent) players of EQlive with characters 
of the same name on Bertoxx.

We have a few play around characters on Guk with the names Tidas, Sceel, and 
Ivey.

My 6 year old daughter has a Kerra named Prettypaw on Blackburrow too. ;-)
