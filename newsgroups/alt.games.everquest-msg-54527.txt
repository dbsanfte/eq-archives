When is a good time for an Iksar Monk to be able to leave his homeland?
If I did leave, then I'd need to get good with a monk guild (isn't only one
in Freeport?) pretty soon as I learn new skills at LV 12, 15, 17, 18, 20,
25, 27, 30, and 35.  For this reason wouldn't after LV35 be the better time?
Or is it more recommended to stay in Kunark until Velious hunting time?  If
I were to leave, would this be considered more of a downgrade in hunting
areas?  What level do most Iksars leave Kunark?
