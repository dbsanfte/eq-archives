About the only firewall you ever need with normal use
is zonealarm. Usually some issues are taken care of basically by your
cable modem or DSL provider and zone alarm solves the trojan and other
security issue.

Basically with zone alarm with the two things it has to configure set
at high, anytime an exe file or file you run is changed you have to
click to accept in zone alarm to run it. It also makes your pc
basically invisible to all the stuff a hacker might try in searching
around for vulnerabilities.

The shareware version is free and more than you'd need:

www.zonealarm.com

www.grc.com is one site which will test your shields to see how
vulnerable you are. Test them before using zonealarm to see how much
you are by default, then test them after. In testing my shields with
my cable modem and zonealarm I see this there:

"Your Internet port 139 does not appear to exist! 
One or more ports on this system are operating in FULL STEALTH MODE!
Standard Internet behavior requires port connection attempts to be
answered with a success or refusal response. Therefore, only an
attempt to connect to a nonexistent computer results in no response of
either kind. But YOUR computer has DELIBERATELY CHOSEN NOT TO RESPOND
(that's very cool!) which represents advanced computer and port
stealthing capabilities. A machine configured in this fashion is well
hardened to Internet NetBIOS attack and intrusion. 
 
Unable to connect with NetBIOS to your computer.
All attempts to get any information from your computer have FAILED.
(This is very uncommon for a Windows networking-based PC.) Relative to
vulnerabilities from Windows networking, this computer appears to be
VERY SECURE since it is NOT exposing ANY of its internal NetBIOS
networking protocol over the Internet "

In probing my ports there, every port says:

"Stealth! There is NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER that a port (or even any
computer) exists at this IP address!" 

The reason why zonealarm is so nice though is it has the added
security step of making it so you have to approve any changing program
that executes or any new program. This has prevented the only trojan I
ever accidently downloaded and ran from doing anything naughty on my
computer.
