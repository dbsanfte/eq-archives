Ok
I have been trying UNSUCCESFULLY for the past 1 and a 1/2 hours to log into
EQ.
I keep getting the same dam message, unable to connect to the server at this
time please try again shortly.  But, all of a sudden, it lets me in to the
servers screen, i see they are up and open for play.  THEN I get a " You
have been disconnected" message. WTF ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
This has not happened once, nor twice, but has continually happened for the
past 1 and 1 /2 hours.  I have tried fresh clean reboots.  Shut down the
computer for 10 minutes and the tried unsuccessfully to enter the server.
What the hell is going on?  If the servers are UP and OK then why is SoE
disconnecting me????????
