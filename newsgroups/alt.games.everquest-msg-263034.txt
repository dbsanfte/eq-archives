Agreed, but that's kind of the point of no-drop items.  They're too powerful
(at least in theory) to allow players to trade them.  If all items were
droppable, there would be even more item inflation than there is now.

Nodrop is the poor-game-developer's item decay.  nodrop items decay when the
owner retires or gets a better item.

Working as intended.  Annoying mechanic, but at least some items get removed
from the game.

>When I read about Tribute, I thought here was a perfect solution;

You haven't stated a problem yet.  There is no solution needed, nodrop is
INTENDED as a way to have fewer items moving through the economy.  Whether it
rots because nobody needs it, or gets banked/destroyed when an upgrade comes
along, it's no longer in circulation.   Job accomplished.

This adds value to droppable items, though, as now people don't need to
destroy it via tribute.  They can get plenty of tribute via old nodrop stuff.

Allowing tribute for no-drop items would leave more equipment floating around
for sale, because fewer droppable items will be tributed.

>I didn't feel this way about Guild Tribute, because I already knew it 
>didn't work for No Drop stuff...

Huh?  Guild tribute and personal tribute have (almost) the same mechanics and
(exactly) the same purpose: as an item/platinum sink in exchange for a bit of
extra power.

>What is the down side of this?

People stop tributing droppable gear.
