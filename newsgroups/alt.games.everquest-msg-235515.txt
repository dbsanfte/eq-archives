You can get PL'ed that way - but once you get to higher levels, it's
sometimes more efficient to leech xp to get levels.

i.e. your necro main solo's stuff that your PL'ed char could never kill.
Level range is obviously the key issue here.

Some PL'ing at particular levels can actually improve the rate characters
get some skills - for example, every time you get hit and you have a damage
shield, you have the potential to get an offense skillup - if you're a
cleric and you're being PL'ed you'll probably get more skillups from a DS
than from trying to hit the mob in question.

Powerlevelled casters can practice their spell skills quietly in the corner
all day to overcome that issue.

Powerlevelled melee characters have to be in a fight to practice their
skills, which is one of the biggest problems PL'ing that type of class.
