Well, keep in mind that not everyone has uber items with focus effects.
Before I joined my current guild and raiding Vex Thal and PoP, I belonged to
smaller, lower-level guild.  When we raided, it was not at all unusual to
see our mages inundated with requests for damage bracers and other summoned
items with useful focus effects.

These days, the bazaar has helped people with equipment quite a bit,
allowing them to search for specific focus effects.  New tradeskill recipes
have allowed people to create focus effect items for just about everything.
So the need isn't as pressing now as it once used to be.

But for the level 50 untwinked necro with no plat to their named, these kind
of summoned items could be very very useful.

Just my observation, anyway.
