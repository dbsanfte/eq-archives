After upgrading my father's PC to a GeForce3, I inherited his Elsa Erazor 
GeForce2 X2 DDR card.  I have the lastest Detonator drivers and SoL 
installed.  I'm running a Celeron 1gig CPU with 544 meg of RAM.

In the old world, I am not having any problems at all.  I play in 1024x768 
and can run through FV near the LOIO zone line with barely a slow-down.  I 
have -all- the models possible turned on.

In Luclin, I have only been in the new city, and I do have minor some 
frame-rate problems, but it is very playable.

I did turn the clipping down a little up in the new city to help, and it 
definitely helped.  I'm at about 75% clip, I believe.  HTH
