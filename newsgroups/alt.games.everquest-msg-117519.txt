Oddly enough, I was also conning corpses that I came across last night.  I 
found several at the zone-in to CT, and a bunch in FG.  In every case when 
I didn't see the person on-line, the rez counter was stopped, the corpse 
counter was moving.  I did come across one 3 hour exactly corpse.  I 
really wish this topic had come up BEFORE I swore off of PoA after 
spending 4 days (over 30 hours total, ugh) over the past 2 weeks there.  
Lots of corpse to play with up there.
