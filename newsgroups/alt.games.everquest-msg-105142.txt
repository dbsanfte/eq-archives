Giant Militia Sword (11 dmg  39 delay) is a magical 1-hand sword
available often from vendors for about 5pp.  Cheap enough to buy at
even very low levels so you can hunt wisps.  Turn in the greater
lightstones to the gypsy woman for experience and a book that you can
sell back to her for 8 or 9 platinum.  Then use the money to get
better weapons or armor.
