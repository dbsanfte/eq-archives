    I know I'm in a good guild and all, but really - raising level and going
to one of the XP heaven zones like PoV is the best thing you can do for AA.
In a regular XP group in CoD (about the same XP/unit time as PoV), I'm
pulling in one AA per one and a half to two hours at 80% AA 20% regular. As
a high DPS type you'd fit into a trials group for PoV/PoS rather nicely, or
a group of your friends could get together and do the quest version of the
flag for CoD. I'm earning XP faster than I ever did before.

    Oh, and speaking of XP, I did some /con tests. At level 65, players (and
thus mobs) level 55+ are dark blue. My official conjecture now is:

Level 65, 55+ dark blue.
Level 64, 53+ dark blue.
Level 63, 51+ dark blue.
Level 62, 49+ dark blue.
Level 61, 47+ dark blue.

    Can anyone at the levels below 65 confirm or disporve the conjecture?
(Note: this also means that Juggs in Sebilis will be dark blue all the way
through 65).

    James
