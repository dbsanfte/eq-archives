Collecting Orc or Gnoll scalps.  ANY of their scalps will do, either those
from Crushbone (Not sure about Black Burrow), or those from High Hold Pass
itself.  If you head to Crushbone, you can probably offer as little as a
gold each (They sell for about 9 cp to a vendor) in /ooc and get a few
buyers.  For the faction you are working on I would recommend Crushbone,
that will add to your faction adjustments, helping newbies as they fight,
snares, heals, anything to get that faction message.  You might even simply
Flame Lick everything in the zone too.

Then head to High Hold Pass.  From EITHER end, there is a Captain above the
first arches you pass through.  Either of them will accept your gifts.  He
will give you a tiny bit of exp (Very tiny) a bit of coin, and, of course.
Faction.
