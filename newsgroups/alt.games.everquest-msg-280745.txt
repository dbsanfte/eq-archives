You cannot progress through the DoN tiers without gaining high enough 
faction with one of the two camps.  You can do as many DoNs as you want, 
and buy the items available to you at the camps, but, you will never gain 
the DoN AAs that you get for completing the various tiers of DoN 
progression.

DoN offers several extremely useful things.  The guild lobby, where you 
can summon your corpses to be rezzed.  The guild hall (if you are in a 
guild), where you can set a portal to a variety of locations for fast 
transportation.  The AAs that you get for DoN progression are actually 
quite nice, and there are great augments, much better than LDoN, 
available for significantly less effort in DoN.  Creator missions are 
boring, and are not even the best ones for gaining crystals, not to 
mention, nowhere near as good xp as some of the others.  People do them 
because they percieve them to be easy, and have never tried the other 
ones, except when they had to for progression purposes.

I have not done a single LDoN since DoN came out, but then, I didn't do 
all that many for some time prior to DoN too.  I found them to be 
generally boring, always the same thing over and over again.  I also beg 
out of doing yet another creator DoN, as that too is quite boring.
