Sweet mother of god, don't send him to LOIO.

And I could have sworn it was a 20+ zone (or at least 18) when I went
there a year or so ago?

My own not even remotely humble opinion is: get SoL.  Get PoP.  SoL
for the bazaar and, well, Paludal is apparently the choice of zones at
12 or 14 (depending on level of twinkage).  PoP because it is hands
down the best investment ever in the game, just for the ease of travel
that now exists.  Do not bother with Velious for quite awhile.  And
unless you want to start a leezard, I can't think of any specific
reason to get Kunark, either.
