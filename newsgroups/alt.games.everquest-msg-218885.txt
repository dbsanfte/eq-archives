I will certainly agree that you give that impression.

[Note that the obvious answer to my mostly rhetorical question is that
the typical L50 Paladin is a PL'd twink who is just then starting to
learn how to play the class.  Which I do not accept as an excuse, when
you group with other players you ought not to be ignorant of your
character's capabilities and how to use them to complement your
groupmates.]
