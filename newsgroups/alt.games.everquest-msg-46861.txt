Oh, yeah. The loot varies from abysmal to non-existant. (We actually
ganked one mob last night that was so rich that I got one copper, and
the luckly cleric got two.) I haven't seen loot like that since the
newbie zone.  But as to the xp, I dont' know where you were hunting but
we've been pulling a steady stream of non-stop blues there. I did lvl 49
in EJ at the TT line, and I'm almost halfway through fifty  there. And
that's only in a four or five sessions of play.
