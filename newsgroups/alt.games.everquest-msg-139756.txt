Easy and fun.  Kill freeport militia.  :)

OK, wasn't necessary for my shaman, but I helped a paladin or two on their
epic, and as a result became KOS in East and West Freeport.  I figured,
well, I'm KOS anyway, guess I'll see if I can get ally in North Freeport.
So, I spent a few days in West Freeport, pulling and killing guards inside
the city.  It was a blast, xp was decent, loot was decent.
