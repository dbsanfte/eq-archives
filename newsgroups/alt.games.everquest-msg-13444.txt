I had something similar happen a few weeks ago with my druid, and it has
not happened since. I gated from LOIO to steamfont, upon arrival I had
some wierd lag-like effect and *wham* I take 250 hits of damage from
falling. OK that was strange, and I ran ao GFay.

I did some buisness in Kelithin and gated to Commons. Again the wierd
lag-like effect and *WHAM* you have taken 675 hits damage LOADING PLEASE
WAIT...

I reported it and went on my way. Has not happened since.
