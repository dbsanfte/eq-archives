I've been doing HG's in Rathe Mts since about 40. Still good cash obviously,
though experience is starting to wane, and I have to try and fear kite 2 at
a time to make it worthwile experience-wise. And, seeing that I play on RZ,
I have to pay attention to the zone as well, as the random-type PKers love
to catch people farming cash there.

I went to Burning Woods yesterday on the suggestion of a co-worker, and
while I can handle most of the common mobs there(wurms cause me some trouble
though), it tends to take a 2/3 to a full bar of mana for whites and some
blues, making it not all that efficient even using CoB for mana regen.

Besides these two places, what other areas would prove to be a good solo
environment for a mid-40's Necro? I do have all the expansions/extensions.
