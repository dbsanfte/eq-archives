Hm, I can't agree with this one. In North Ro you'll find lots of things that
will chew up level 4's. In the East Commons you'll find a lot of people 
trading, some passing through, some power-levelling and others farming the
quite lucrative belts. It's been one of the worst places i've been in for
groups.

Hunting orcs in Faydark is group friendly, and lucrative, but I get lost
both on the ground and in the town. 

The erudite newbie ground is just insanely unpleasant.

I've had really good experiences in everfrost (barbarian newbie area).
Real sense of atmosphere, generally sociable and all the barb classes
are group friendly (ie. no casters :)

I even ran my L3 high elf paladin (now retired at 18) across the
continent so I could play there.
