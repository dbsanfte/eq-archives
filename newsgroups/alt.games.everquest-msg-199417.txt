1. You can solo from level 1. However its not until you reach 34 that you
can start quadkiting for real.

2. You can scribe the spell "Imbue Fire Opal" and cast it.  Wear the Solusek
Ro diety rings (-str, +int, +mana, +svf, +hp, +ac). I find it rather strange
there is no more Solusek Ro diety items out there... unlike Tunare and
Karana items. But then again, they are druid gods and druids get everything
in the game. SOE/VI never paid much attention to wizards except when they go
on nerfing sprees.

3. I would rather have a Gnome based on stats... but my wizard is a High
Elf. At the end of the day your starting stats doesnt really matter. Choose
a race you are happy with.

...and dont really make a wizard. You will get depressed. Make a halfling
druid instead. Afterall, how can 100 billion halfling druids be wrong? The
damage output a wizard does doesnt justify the specialization he sacrificed
compared to other classes. Also there are no nuke PoP spell upgrades for the
wizard class, I think every other class got upgrades, but wizards didn't.
That should make you think abit.
