Still no luck in finding the Bladed Thulian Claws for sale....but then
again I don't have the patience to sit in EC and watch text scroll buy
for more than 30 minutes at a time anymore. :)  I picked up a Sharkjaw
Cutlass (10/32) and have been wielding that in the offhand and my
Silvery War Axe (6/22) in the primary slot until I get my 1HS and dual
wield skills maxed (1HS is 75 out of a possible 100, dual wield still
a dismal 55), at which time I'll switch hands. 

Still looking for Bladed Thulian Claws - if anybody has any for sale
on The Rathe (pp, not cash) please shoot me an email.

And just for curiosity's sake - does anybody know what kind of a
difference I'll see in damage once I get over the damage cap? My
Nathsar Greatsword is 17/30 and I hit for 28-30 with it now (I'm level
19). I hit for around 18 with the Sharkjaw Cutlass and around  9-12 or
so with the Silvery War Axe, if I remember correctly. With my current
loadout I've got a STR of 109 when dual wielding and 119 with the
Nathsar.

thanks,

Scott
