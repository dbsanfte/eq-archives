How in the hell do you look at those numbers (or the numbers posted by georg) 
and see ANYTHING other than they have made it significantly easier to gain exp?  
Why would things return to normal at 20?  Verant has said nothing about 20, but 
a lot about 30.  Do you even read the patch messages?

Well, why should he?  You don't accept his evidence here, you most likely won't 
accept georg's evidenct, why would you believe anything about exp in level 19?  
I think this, along with the other information posted, pretty conclusively 
proves that exp is significantly easier to come by at lower levels than it was 
before the patch.
