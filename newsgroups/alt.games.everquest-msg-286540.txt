I can't, it's impossible to know how I would react knowing nothing.

That's not the point I have at any stage been trying to make.

Lance did know better, because I told him a long time back, he ignored 
that advice and continued to get frustrated about the lack of updates in 
the one place he kept checking.

Sony's public EQ face is shockingly bad.  It's communication is bad. 
The way it manages the game is bad.  I agree with all these things.

However, that doesn't preclude us from taking action ourselves to 
alleviate how much frustration we suffer.  I don't suffer any 
frustration at the EQ Players page because I don't use it.
