EQ2 is *group* oriented. Everything revolves around *one* group. If you
want to play EQ2 for raiding you'll be sorely disappointed. That's not to
say that there is no raiding it's just that raiding is secondary to group
play. Therefore, MGB's aren't as needed as in EQ1. Also, buffs are mostly
concentration (those that last any amount of time) and each caster only has
5 points of concentration to use, so you most likely won't see the page
full of buffs like in EQ1.

No wonder nobody comes here--it's too crowded.
