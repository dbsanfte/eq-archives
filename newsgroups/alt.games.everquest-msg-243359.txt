This is incorrect.  Each item has a certain number of tribute points
assigned to it (listed by e.g. http://lucy.allakhazam.com/), and
that's how many points you will get, regardless of level, class or
race.  At least that's been my experience - all items are worth what
lucy lists, whether I can use them or not.

In light of that, you won't be helped much by an answer to your
question (not that I could answer it anyway).  And after the tribute
value nerfs, I suspect you'd be better off farming cash and buying
things with a high tribute-to-plat ratio in the bazaar.  There are
some items with tribute values in the hundreds that drop in the LoY
zones, but I still suspect money farming would be faster.
