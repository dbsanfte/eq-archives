Or not.

Potential is called potential for a reason -- because it *isn't* what
is has a potential to be.  A potential human being is not a human
being.  Otherwise it wouldn't be a *potential* one.

We are all *potential* murderers, theives, and/or rapists.  That
doesn't mean that we should all be thrown in jail or executed on the
off chance we might turn into such a person.

A fetus is a *potential* human being, just like every cell in your
body.  Every cell -- from the stem cell to the liver cell to the
epithelial cells you slough off into your feces is "potentially" a
human being.  If you want to wax poetic about the inalienable rights of
every *potential* human, don't worry about the fetus.  You should be
carefully collecting every excretion you produce -- just in case.

The wacky thing about the "fetus is a potential human being" argument
is that it is based, fundamentally,  on the idea that with appropriate
technology, it could survive as an individual.  On the other hand, the
*very same* people argue that stem cell work that would clone a human
being using similar technology is a great sin -- we are "playing God"
by exploring the very "potential" they hold so sacred in a fetus.
Potayto, Potahto.

I can't wait until the first cloned human fetus is implanted.  Will it
be a sin to abort it?  The minute that happens, will it become a sin to
go to the bathroom -- and waste all those potential humans?

And, of course, even if the fetus *is* a human being, it has no greater
rights than the mother.  There is no Christian obligation to support a
parasite.  I'll start listening to the hypocritical rants of the
anti-abortion fanatics the minute they start picking up vagrants from
the bus station and giving them keys to their homes and cars.  Even in
today's modern society, pregnancy and birth take a permanent toll in
terms of health and danger to the mother.

It's amazing how people are so quick to talk about *other* people's
moral obligations, but not apply the same principles to themselves.  A
mother has the same obligation to house a fetus that your basic
fundamentalist has to house a random vagrant at his or her expense.
It's a wonderful act of charity, and it's good if one chooses to do
so.  It is not an obligation, however, to be imposed by someone else.

Any pro-lifer that owns his or her own home is a hypocrite.

Feh.
