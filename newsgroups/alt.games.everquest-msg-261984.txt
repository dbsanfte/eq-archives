  Need at least 3 people to create an instance.

  First and easiest set are in Dranik's Scar; go
north from the land-in spot and look for three
identical caves on the eastern zone wall.  In
front of the middle cave is an npc, Grand Historian
Somebody - he'll randomly give you one of
three different instances. (Be warned, not real
different - they all pretty much look the same
and are ugly as hell, with no real point to them
other than having stuff to kill, and stuff respawns
so you can stay in all day if you desire.)  Each
instance does have a couple nameds with
placeholders that will spawn, and these nameds
will sometimes drop spell runes, so I've been
farming here for my 66-68 spells.

  Other instances are sewers and catacombs in
Ruined City of Dranik; I'm not sure how difficult
these are.  And there's some instanced zones off
of Muramite Proving Grounds, but I hear those
are geared more towards the Time/GoD crowd.
