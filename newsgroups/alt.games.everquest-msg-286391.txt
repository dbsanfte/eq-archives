Some words about AC in Ocean of Tears.

In general chat I heard a player in distress in OoT.  Seems he was caught in 
geometry.  With my 75 druid I went in to rescue.  We evac'ed and upon 
questioning, found that he/she had come to do AC for the JBoots quest.

I lead to the island across from Seafuries, where on the new map "Ancients" 
was noted  and approximately where AC used to be.  Not seeing much that 
would be helpful, I consulted Bestiary and read that this AD now is on the 
island WITH the Seafuries, west of the deserted Druid ring.

When we landed the area was crawling with Seafury Cyclopses but among the 
first things that the companion targeted was AC himself.  I dove right in, 
withstanding the blows of not only him but several Seafuries as well. 
Companion and I ported out, him with the ring.
