My guild doesn't really have many rogues, but the few that I group with (if
you figure, most of what we kill goes to like 3 active rogues) still have a
little edge on mages.. the mobs that I kill anyway.

I don't think mages are gimp (whatever I said in the reply to the ebay guy)
but I don't think they are anywhere near #1 DPS spot either, in exp or
raids.
