Yep yep, in retrospect the clue was there, I just never looked.  I mean.  Lull
line. Why did I even buy this tripe?  Because I'm a fanatic about getting every
single spell no matter how much of a stinker it is.

Paladins get WOT?

To Brell with Paladins, Clerics just became a pulling class.

Well then the message is meaningless, but still, it sure looks like 25% resist,
25% aggro on resist... I can handle one bad pull in 16!

With single target versions of this line, pulling from a group of four would
mean 3 bad pulls in 16, still acceptable but more annoying.

I'm lost, whats the pacify for?  OH, he's come in, and is so close that atoning
him where I rooted him will still put him in aggro range after the atone.

Ho ho ho, I"m very excited about this christmas present, never thought about
that combo!  (never would have with Pacify being so busted)

Oh my grin is so wide its starting to hurt... better drink a beer fast for the
numbing effect.
