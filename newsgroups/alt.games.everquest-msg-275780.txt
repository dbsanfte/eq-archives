Killing the named mob, "The Banished" may increase your faction. and
killing the settlers in Thunder Villiage does as well,. these however
are very high for the zone,. so it is not real advisable. I don't know
of any other ways to raise Centaur faction, the quests don't seem to do
it that are given by the Watcher of the Fields.
