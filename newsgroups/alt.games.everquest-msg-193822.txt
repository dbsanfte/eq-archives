This is actually copied from an email I sent to EQTech.

My Dark Elf Warrior permanently has a shadow tint to the skin on his face as
if I am still wearing a plate helm. I have not seen any other Dark Elves (or
any other race models) with this problem and I appear this way to others as
well as myself. I have removed all TXC files and repatched, tried
/dopropertinting (+zone) on an off and messed about with logging without
helm equipped then doing the above again.
This problem is only with Luclin Models, anyone using old models will see my
skin texture as normal.

The response I got was;

While in the game type /dopropertinting off.

/sigh

Thought I explained how I had already tried this.

Anyone else know a solution to this problem next step is a full reisntall
