Before I begin, what server are you hunting mammoths on :-)

There are only 6 mammoth slots and the tainteds do take up a slot.
Around the camp is the best place to hunt them if you are keeping the
herd trimmed. Sow is your friend as you can spot them visually
sometimes faster than trackers can track them down. When I had my
pally hunting them I was out killing rangers and druids that had
track. When killing them as fast as the spawn they seem to come in
waves of three, one wave will come from the IG side of the camp and
the next will come from the side with the north tower, where TJ and
his bear hang out. GL on your hunting.
