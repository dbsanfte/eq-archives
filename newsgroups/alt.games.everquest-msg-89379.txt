Here's something for you to try out.  If you set your desktop to 1024x768, 
16bit color, and 60hz refresh, go run EQ at that resolution and you will 
see it flicker.  Promise.  Just for more fun, go run Quake 3 at that 
resolution and color depth and you will also see flicker.  Now change your 
desktop to 85hz and rerun those games and I'll bet you dollars to dognuts 
it doesn't flicker. 

I'm not claiming to be a master at this stuff, but I think it has 
something to do with the way Direct X handles 3D cards.
