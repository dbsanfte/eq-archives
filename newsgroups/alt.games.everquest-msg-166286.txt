Yeah, why the 1 through 62 cutoff? Why was 63 suddenly pointless?
Aahhaa. 

Of course the game is pointless, you never "win." This is precisely 
why verant added 5 more levels and did previous things like adding AA
points. They want to make it even seem less like you "win." 

People have not "won" really since way back when there was only
Everquest, with no expansions. Back then some people got to 50 and
got 19 sets of rubicite and everything they could and later got all
their plane armor. They then had nothing more to do except make
twinks. Many of them quit. This is when Verant really knew they had to
make an expansion and they had to make 50 to 60 hell on earth and
continually up the ante on the gear you could get and the force you
needed to get it.

A few more people quit in the kunark era when they had their epic,
level 60 and all the kunark armor. Once again, they had "won." This
probably cemented verant's decision to do velious the way it was done
with Quest armor and the possibility that even if you got thurg/pog
armor you'd later get Skyshrine TOV and perhaps even after that Kael
TOV armor. When they saw uber guilds mow through this stuff is
probably when AA was thought of.
