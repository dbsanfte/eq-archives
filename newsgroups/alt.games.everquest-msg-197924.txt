Well, you'd have to admit that it's pretty screwed up when you come
out with a new expansion with shiny new toys in shiny new zones and
then _don't_ expect the majority of your players to actually level as
quickly as possible to check them out. 

Some people (myself included) actually did stay at 61 for a while but
that isn't going to appeal to the majority and it should have been
obvious from the start. Once you hit 62 there really wasn't any
turning back (except deleveling).
