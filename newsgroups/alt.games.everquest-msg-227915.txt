Yes, as Graeme has pointed out, you can simply copy the entire folder to a
new machine and resume from where you left off, fully patched and all. SOE
is one of those few game publishers these days that does not write a lot of
instance-specific information to the Windows Registry, requiring a
re-installation for significant changes. Star Wars Galaxies was similar in
that regard. Don't know about Planetside as I didn't buy it, but I bet it's
the same.
