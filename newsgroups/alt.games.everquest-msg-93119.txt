Has anyone here seen this drop at any time in the last couple of months?

This is one of the two remaining things I need for my epic.

I've gone on a couple dozen Hate raids now, and never seen it drop, even
once.

There's a guy on my server that's been doing biweekly open-invite Hate raids
for the last 8 or 9 months, and he says he hasn't seen any drop in months.

Nobody else I've talked to has seen it drop lately either.

It's supposed to drop off the female revenants.  We cleared out every
revenant in the zone yesterday, from both floors, and it didn't drop.

I'm starting to think that they screwed up the drop table when they added
the minibosses.
