There are a couple of problems I see.

1.  There really is no easy way to automatically figure out the 
"difficulty" of a quest.  SoE would have to go through and assign a 
difficulty to each and every quest in the game.

2.  The item itself cannot change, it's stats need to change based on 
something else stored in your character record (in this case for quests).  
To the best of my knowledge, the game does not track what quests you have 
completed.  Thus, no record, and, thus, no way to compute the current 
value of the charm.  The reason I say this is that each item type is a 
unique item in the database, with either variable stats based on 
something else, or fixed stats.  They do not have a mechanism to make 
each instance of an item something unique with it's own stats.
