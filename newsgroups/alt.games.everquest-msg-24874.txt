Summary:

You're primarily a mid-30s guild with some folks inevitably deciding to play
their favorite character and they quickly get into their 50s.  Just as
inevitably they find it hard to group their most favorite character with
their friends.  They also find that in order to do the big raids most guilds
require membership so, with heavy heart, they leave their friends.

Yup, my previous guild had the same problem.  Our guild leader had a huge
heart and took everything personally, so when someone quit she required them
to remove all alts, which I think (hindsight, though it worked out ok) was a
mistake.

Eventually a decent percentage of our guild finally got planable and as the
average age of primaries rose steadily higher we no longer had the problem.
In fact, we gained back a number of people we had lost before (uber guilds
can be a pain in the ass).

So, what do I recommend you do?  Tell them you understand, let them go
without guilt, and invite them to keep their alts in the guild.  You keep in
touch with friends and build a link to that other guild...and that never
hurts when you inevitably start working on epic weapons (keep it in mind
that this WILL be an issue).  As a guild leader I've finally realized how
much networking (aka goober-smooching) is necessary if you want your guild
to be taken seriously, even as a social guild (it IS possible for social
guilds to be taken seriously...you don't have to be an adolescent-like
player who says stupid things like "bitz" and "suxor" in Raid Guild to be
taken seriously).
