Can you please point this out to the druids I've spoken to?  I swear,
we had one druid in our guild bitching for an hour the other day about
how they can't make any money anymore.  I finally got annoyed enough
to suggest they sow their lazy asses one zone away from a book or
spire and listen to the amount of "donating for port to Nexus!" cries

Ryou
(and I STILL hear requests for ports to the nexus from spire-enabled
zones, and ports from the nexus TO spire-enabled zones)
