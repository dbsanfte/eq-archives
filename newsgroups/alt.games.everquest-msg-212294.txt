That being so (and in light of the overwhelming majority of what
you've posted to the thread I'm willing to believe it), I still
see no way to infer anything else from those two sentences.

It sure looks to me as if you have defined closed-mindedness there.

Ok.  That's a fair and important distinction, I'll remember it.

Keep in mind that I was objecting to the two statements you closed your

post with, which I quoted in my response.  I still object to them, for
that matter.  OTOH, I should have worded my objection more carefully to
focus it on those two sentences specificly, rather than you generally,
and for that I apologize.
