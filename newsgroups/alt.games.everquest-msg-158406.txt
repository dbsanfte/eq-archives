A rez is a rez as far as your corpse is concerned once accepted the flag is
cleared and the corpse can no longer be rezzed. Unfortuneately this includes
the zero exp one. There have been some cases (bugs) with soul binded items
that an item will appear on the corpse and you will have it on your toon.
This corpse can be rezzed over and over again with no exp regained after the
first but this has been fixed I think.
