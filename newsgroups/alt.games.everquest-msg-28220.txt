Last night in BBM some clown was shouting for a port to *Steamfont*,
for Christ's sake.  I'd had a rough night with beggars so I got
irritated and said in ooc:" You don't NEED a port to Steamfont, it's a
10 minute run tops!"  In ooc he replies, "Hehe, don't know the way,"
so I /tell him "www.eqatlas.com."  There's a short silence while he
digests this, and then he shouts, "Really NEED a  port to Steamfont."

<sigh>

And yes, I know, I should be thankful he didn't ask for a trans to
GFay.
