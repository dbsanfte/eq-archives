i was in a group the other day in the icehouse in kael and the leader of the
raid said he was doing a forced spawn.  when he would do it we would get
rushed by giants two at a time, and we got tons of plate drops, about ten in
one night doing this, none of which i won of course (.  my question is how
do you force spawns like that, so i can do my own raids there, any help is
appreciated. thanks
