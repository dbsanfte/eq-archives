Can they throw fishing grubs? And I am mad at the cleric who tried to
rez me when my timer ran out; he LEFT MY FISHING GRUBS on my corpse :)
(He said something about leaving my nekkid body in the ToV entrance
for a couple days. Bah. And it took forever to forage another grub.)

At least you *have* a list. The clerics on EMarr tried to sort out
some kind of lottery but I don't think it's going to well (some guilds
insisting it's their god given right to charge in and kill every RF
spawn they see, stuff like that)
