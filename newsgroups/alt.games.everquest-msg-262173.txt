In both scenarios the group was 2+ rooms away when the monk and later 
myself got charmed. Group was *nowhere* in sight.

In the case of the monk; we'd killed our mob. The monk went forward to 
pull the next one, the group hung back, with an empty hallway before the 
next room.

The monk got charmed, and then 3 skells and the monk came pouring back 
on the group. No way we should have had aggro.
