No, you can't log in the same account twice at the same time.  You need 
two accounts, each with a separate login and password.  Buy a second 
copy of the game with new CD keys for each expansion, and start 
levelling a new character on the new account.  You won't need to install 
the game again from the new CDs but you'll need the new keys to activate 
the account.
