He probably means had worse rather than has. Until the last change,
camping ragefire for up to 85 hours was common, and anyone not in a
large high end guild ran the risk of having the spawn stolen by someone
else unless their server ran a list that was respected by all, which was
the exception rather than the rule. A cleric in my guild back then
camped 80+ hours (as in kept his character logged in and mostly at the
screen) two weeks in a row only to have ragefire stolen both times
because at that time our guild was mostly EST working people who
wouldn't likely be on if Ragefire spawned in the morning, which he often
did due to 7-8am PST server ups. Prior to that, camping SolB for
ragefire was another insanely long camp, subject to slightly less chance
of kill stealing but also risking Nagafen spawning and resetting the
whole thing.

The current incarnation of the cleric epic is much, much easier, with
the only really difficult thing being getting a raid on Chardok royals,
and that's only difficult for low end guilds without the force, or a
high end guild where people are tired of Chardok camps. In the latter
case, the only people I really see having trouble getting a force for
Chardok are people trying to get epics for twinks. The rare main that
joins our guild unepiced rarely has trouble getting a Chardok raid.


(finally got around to finishing my epic after 2 years)
