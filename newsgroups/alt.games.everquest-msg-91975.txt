49 druid halfling here...pretty much soloed 30 through 44 or so in East
Wastes doing the ulthorks near what is called "u tree".  I wouldn't
recommend you try quad kiting them until you get a few more levels, as it
was my experience there were a LOT of resists of that aoe spell until about
lvl 38...
