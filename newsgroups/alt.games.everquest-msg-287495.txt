Technically, Fair Use doesn't allow anything, it's an agreed exclusion 
for breaching copyright, and you have to prove your use was fair in 
court after being sued.

Also, even if you're a lawyer you'd be unlikely to commit to saying fair 
use covers it, because it's been shown in many court cases over the 
years that fair use has very different interpretations based on the 
source material and the intent of the person re-publishing it.

Sony provide a commercial service which relies on their copyright 
material.  Anyone providing a substitute service using their copyright 
material would struggle, in my non-legal non-laywer view, to claim fair 
use.  It's breach of copyright to avoid paying subscription fees.

But there's no point debating fair use, because you have to prove it in 
a court of law once sued.

It is however, worth remembering why fair use was introduced, which was 
to initially protect a number of uses of material,

"Section 107 contains a list of the various purposes for which the 
reproduction of a particular work may be considered �fair,� such as 
criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. 
Section 107 also sets out four factors to be considered in determining 
whether or not a particular use is fair:

    1.      the purpose and character of the use, including whether such 
use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;

    2.      the nature of the copyrighted work;

    3.      amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to 
the copyrighted work as a whole; and

    4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of 
the copyrighted work."

It was designed to protect 'comment' and 'education'.  It's also been 
used to allow time-shifting of TV recordings obviously, which don't 
really fall under those categories, so it *is* possible to avoid 
breaches through fair use, but it's not automatic and it's not simply a 
case of 'keeping it small and cost free'.

This is still my favourite page on copyright - 
http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html - although it tends to 
focus on the reproduction of written content on the 'net, it still has 
value.
