Dunno, my 6-person group did ok with a couple of low 50s tanks.  I took my
49 (at the time) enchanter and died a few times before I got the hang of
it...those critters really really dislike enchanters.  I found myself
casting Reoccurring Amnesia after each spell I cast.

The frost cubes can be mezzed.  I know that the <errr, tentacle terror
things> cannot and I'm pretty sure the coldain skels can't either.  Velious
is very annoying for enchanters (well, this one anyway).  Their magic
resistance is just normal, from what I could tell.

But I'm hardly an expert, we barely got away from the zone line and I've
only been there twice.  At least I got Improved Invisibility out of that
camp. :)
