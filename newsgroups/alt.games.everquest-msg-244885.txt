Actually.. the human cultural its used for can now have a backend
benefit. Select pieces provide a good return on money invested for
tribute points(nothing uber-mindblowing), but you may get 500 'free'
tribute of which on a 20 combine run can get you 10K extra points
while still getting bumps.

Saltwater Seaweed is a bitch to fish in OOT for some reason due to old
world positioning. I was getting problems where you'd fish once.. and
then it would view you as on land and you'd have to try to reposition
fish once, same thing. Was not worth the effort.
