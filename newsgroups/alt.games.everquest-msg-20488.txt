I think the prices fluctuate so much on all the different servers
that making a list would be impossible. Just like Kilmir said,
especially with his example of the advisor robe. I've seen
it sold for 2kpp,3kpp and way less. FBR (flowing black robes)
go for 100pp, 200pp, or 300pp depending on how bad someone
wants to sell it.
