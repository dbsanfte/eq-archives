Idea extension:
Targetted skill, Butcher. Obtained by SKs, Rangers, Necros, shaman and
rogues?

Essentially works as a forage targetting a corpse. Bone chips, XYZ parts,
chunks of meat, and at higher levels chances for 'restricted' things like
banquet sized chunks, or other squishy pieces with a use. Corpse is
trashed in the use of the skill.

Or even as a stop gap, bring them in as a forage option.....there must be
plenty of orc bones mouldering down in Gfay....
