And the bad part is that you pretty much need them to go past a certain 
point in baking.  Somewhere around 142 or so.  That's where I am stuck 
because I can't track the ones in GFay, and I am not about to hunt them in 
LFay.  Of course, there's dragon meat for baking, but I've yet to -see- a 
dragon, let along loot some meat.
