We were in the middle of a HARD LDON, tough group too.  My 31 shaman was the
healer and a LOT of these mobs were red.  We were all at under 50% health when
the serverwide message came up.  I had 15 mana - no one else had much more.  
Paladin kept pulling, even at 25% health.  We were getting the *marks* with
almost every mob.  We were down to one left - ignoring the SW messages.  Ranger
was healing me while pally was pacifying, I was canabalizing, it was insane,
almost no chatter.
Bad overpull - all of us ran to zone - except one who gated out.  We zoned and
zoned back in.  I rooted the *straggler*, all his friends came running back. 
We zoned again and zoned back.  Only the ranger, mage and I were left inside
now with one mob at zone in point.  The ranger was hacking away at 20% health,
I canabalized down to 11% health and gave him one last heal.  Mage was oom but
his pet was doing the best he could.  We killed the vile thing!
Ranger looted the last mark, and grabbed an aug - a strength one -we got the
*mission complete* - followed by "Server is coming down NOW".  
All of us were cheering, the ranger was apologizing about the aug, it was a
wonderful way to get cut off :))))
