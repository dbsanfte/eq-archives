Yes seriously.   I was keeping AGE updated with the progress so maybe
somebody can give a more specific time

1 word:Paladual

Heavy twinking and buffs, my rogue zoned in at level 1 (mage and cleric
following him, I need a 60 druid /nod) killed his way to some huge named guy
(well, hit them once or twice, the DS did everything else) and then back to
the zone.  I did take a few wrong turns (some underwater tunnel section) but
basically killed everything from zonein to named to zonein, dinging every
handful of kills

Pull mob, beat on it till I've done 1+ melee damage, pull next, repeat.
Soon as I'd hit it once I'd get another mob (hard to keep track of who I hit
when I just pull a lot at once), so cuz of the big DS, I was killing 5-6+ in
about the same time as the first died

He could solo a bandit w/fungi (totally kept up with the mobs hits) as long
as he had a DS to do some damage
