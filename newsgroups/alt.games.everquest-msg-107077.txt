My poor little elf scout needs advice.

I use a Piercer in my primary hand, I find a Crystal Grinder a good
option. I switch off to a Drachnid Leg Tip someone handed me in
Overthere. (No I didn't get it in FV)

I have a Lightcrawler Antenna Whip in the other hand. It is a 1hs.
Should I use a faster 1hs? My 1hs skill is always lagging. I have max
dual wield.

Any suggestions for a off hand? Stay with whip, another 1hs, a new
1hb, or should I be using a second piercer?

I have zero 1hb and hth skill. Problem?
