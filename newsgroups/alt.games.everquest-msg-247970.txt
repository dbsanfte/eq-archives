That is absolutely true, but that presumes the admin is honest. Your 
right most good systems use one-way hashes to secure the Password.

However, a dishonest admin, would have no reason to use a 'secure 
password' system in the first place, if he intends to later read out the 
user/pw combos. In which case its trivial for him to do so later. Or he 
could install keyloggers, or other monitoring stuff... compile it right 
into the kernel if he wants...

With websites its even easier... if he's the dev/admin he could have it 
email him the user/pw combo the user enters while creating an account in 
the first place... and never even need to 'read the passwords' out of a 
system...

Its not easy. The techniques i described above are *far* easier to 
implement if stealing passwords is your objective.
