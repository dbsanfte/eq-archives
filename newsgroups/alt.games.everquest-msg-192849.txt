Having raids *and* parties seems unnecessarily complicated to me. I dont see
any particular problem with a 32 player party, except the party window would
maybe need a scrollbar on it. The current raid window that displays level
and classes could easily be applied to the current party. Will never happen
of course, since raids were implemented as a "selling point" for pop. As
like the maps in loy and the different face textures with luclin(?) they
should have just been standard issue, but SOE feels the need to bribe us (or
blackmail in the case of raid)
