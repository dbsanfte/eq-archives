Eewww... I'm really gonna have to research that then.  Might change what 
haste spells I use.

Oh, sure, each gnome is a 100% slow for one swing.  That's much better than 
spine break, which just gave me a resist message.  There are apparently 
some higher level slowing poisons that I still haven't tried, but given 
that spine break gave me "this mob is immune to changes in its movement 
speed", I don't hold out much hope.
