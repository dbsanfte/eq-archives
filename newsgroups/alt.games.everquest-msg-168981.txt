When I first set up Everquest all those many years ago (okay, a year and a
half ago), one of the first things I did was remap the direction keys.  I
prefer it when I can use my right hand to move the mouse and my left hand to
control the direction I move in.  This is how System Shock was set up, which
was one of the first three-dimensional action games I ever played.  (As an
aside, System Shock is one of the best computer games made, ever.)  I also
set up Mechwarrior II that way and did pretty well.  So for Everquest, I use
W and S to move forward and backwards, and A and D to move left and right.

So, YKYPTMEQW... you get back from lunch, sit at your workstation, and think
about what you have to do next.  When you look down, you notice that your
right hand is on the mouse and that your left hand is poised perfectly over
the W, A, and D keys.

It's when I get a paper cut and hit the "4" key to CH myself that I'll begin
to worry.
