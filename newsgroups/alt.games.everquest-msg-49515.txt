Yes. Unfortunately, it's other games that tend to draw me away from EQ.
Put away EQ for a while to play BGII. Put away EQ for a while to play D2.
Always come back to EQ though. That my wife is an EQ addict as well
doesn't help my chances for escape.

The nice thing about getting to level 50 or so before taking a break
is that you can leave for a few months and your peers will only have
gained a couple or few levels upon your return.
