The flaw with this model is that while some resources are infinite (bone
chips, for instance) others are not (player time required to harvest bone
chips, for instance).  There is a limited supply of bone chips because there
are a limited number of people willing to invest the time required to
harvest them.

Acrylia pieces and ore are a good example of market economics.  I've seen
people come to Dawnshroud and buy them for 1/10th the market price from
people who don't have time to sell them in the Bazaar.  When I sell them in
the Bazaar I check the current prices and set mine 1p lower.  Several times
I've seen other acrylia traders come by and buy me out just to keep the
price up.
