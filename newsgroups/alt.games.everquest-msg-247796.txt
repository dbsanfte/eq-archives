The fact of the matter is that SoE doesn't recognize "camp jumping". In 
their eyes, if there are mobs to be had, then everyone has the same right 
to them. What you did was killsteal, so you were the only one in any sort 
of violation there.

Aside from an expectation of common courtesy, we don't have any right to 
try to impose our own guidelines merely because we don't like the current 
system in place. What you should have done was make an attempt to work 
out a mutually beneficial solution rather than try to run them off.

Was it acceptible for them to just show up and horn in on the group of 
mobs you were camping without word one? Not really. However, it was just 
a wrong for you to expect to monopolize a lower-level camp like that in 
the first place and more wrong for you to do in in the described manner.
