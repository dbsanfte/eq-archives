    Going down his bullet points:

    (1) All priests having full AA's. Not likely. The number of clerics with
Fury, or shamans with healing adept/gift capped are going to be quite small
(as examples).
    (2) All priests having the same number of AA's. Not likely. Depending on
server conditions, either the clerics will be far ahead of the others (AoE
groups) or far behind (solo/multibox culture).
    (3) All priests having the same amount of mana regen from FT+MC. In any
officer award system, FT_cleric > FT_druid > FT_shaman. In addition, only
the shaman is likely to have MC 3 (prereq for Can 5).
    (4) All spells cost 40% less. That ignores differences in area of
specialization (some druids aren't alteration, for example).
    (5) Sitting med rate is wrong (too low). Standing med rate may be off
for clerics, depending on Yaulp V usage.
    (6) Mana pool size assumptions. Shamans will tend to have higher HPs,
lower MANA, clerics will have high MANA, druids will fall between clerics
and shamans in an officer-award system.
    (7) The cleric CH size assumption. It may be good in a standard XP
group, but that's because the standard XP group includes pulls of multiple
mobs which require spot healing. So a cleric lacks the time to focus on one
tank and time the CH right. Thott is also a puny 6800 HP bard, so I'm not
surprised his clerics start CH early on him. ;-)
    (8) The mitigation section simulates resists on slow by raising the cast
time on it by 20%. If slow does not land the first time, the shaman
mitigation curve will be much, MUCH lower than it is at the start. A better
way of handling this would have been to find shaman average mitigation as a
function of resist rate. This methodology also lacks any sense of aggro
control - if the shaman really cast slow as soon as the mob was engaged,
he'd lose a lot of mana just from being unable to med/from self-healing/from
dying.
    (9) The backwards assumption that everyone being damaged would favour
Quiescence over a cleric. He's ignoring the fact that aggro doesn't bounce
all over the place like a ping-pong ball, but tends to settle on a few
targets. It will usually last long enough to kill those targets unless
healed. In situations like that, a cleric's "save them now" Supernal Remedy,
combined with Healing Adept/Gift, will be *much* more efficient than
Chloroblast without HA/HG. And those will be the heals of choice, since
aggro leaving the target before they die cannot be assumed.

    Is that specific enough? Thott likes to be intellectual, but in EQ you
have to make very strict assumptions to get any conclusions. And those
assumptions can be tilted to get whatever you want out.
