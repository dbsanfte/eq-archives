ahh that explains why i saw someone with thousands of them in the bazaar.
God, i'd be soooo rich if i had known! (drool)

making them by hand is a nightmare and would kill velium tailoring/smithing.
Acrylia is much easier to work with than hand brewed coldain tempers, unless
you were able to use some sort of macro proggie i guess.

In-game macroing is the only thing i really miss about SWG.

I hope they have it in EQ2 and they don't have houses that decay but i fear
they will, and being a crafter means you can't play casually, ala SWG. Ah
well, have to wait and see.
