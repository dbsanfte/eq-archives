Quest for the Holy Grail.. er Illusion Scaled Wolf:



Start, version one:



Go to the girl in the cigar shop in Halas, and hand in the following:

1 wolf scales

1 glowing black stone

1 werewolf cloak

1 staff of the serpent



important note: Faction doesn't matter on this turn in, but you must have up
Illusion: Dark Elf. this is an important step. even if you are a dark elf
make sure you have the illusion up.



You will receive a note back and your staff of the serpent (warning, this is
a slightly different staff of the serpent, if you screw up the quest from
now on, do not start over using this method, or she will simply say 'thank
you' and keep your staff).



Start, version two:



You must collect 4 Stein's of Moggok and turn them into King Kazon
Stormhammer while you have up Illusion: Ogre. He will give you back a 10
slot container. Collect the following:

Pegasus Cloak

Astral Titan Leggings

A Purple Headband

Boots of Flowing Slime

Earring of Ethereal Energy

Shiny Metallic Robe

Braclet of the Mind

Silver Chittin Hand Wraps

Staff of Discord

Dreadful Hat

Combine in container, and hand into Stormhammer, this time with Illusion:
Troll up. He will give you a note to give to the next npc.



Step 2:

Now you have to go to Felwithe, and talk to Yuin Starchaser. You need to
give him your note, and a copy of scale of the wolf. You must do this with
Illusion: Iksar up. He will hand you back 'An incomplete transcription'.

Step 3:

For the next step you must collect the Treant's Fists gauntlets, see
allakhazam's for details.

Step 4:

You need to turn in several items to Bait Masterson in East Freeport:

Treant's Fists Gloves

Insidious Gloves

Illusionist's Gloves

Dazzling Gloves

He will give you the 'Wet Fished Gloves', +25 sta, -10 chr, +17 wis, -30 hp
2 ac Ench only lore/nodrop gloves with Improved Healing IV, and also will
spawn 4 level 44 scaled wolves inside the bar to the north who will proceed
through the zone, killing all they come across, untill they reach the Priest
of Discord, which will usually defeat them.



You need to kill all 4 of them, they have approximatly 3k hp, are 100% MR
(even with tash) and quad for about 500.

Each one has a nodrop 'Basket of the hounds of scale'. They are  4.7 lb, 10
slot, tiny only containers. Collect them all.



Step 5:

Take the 4 baskets to Qeynos, and find the OTHER Bait Masterson. Hand them
to him. He will hand you a note. Now you need to get one more item from him,
the Master Baiter Badge (Lore, Nodrop, norent, Str -205 Agi +5 Wis -10
Int -10 Chr -75 Ench only, wearable the Face slot. This item has a faction
modifier and must be worn during the next turn in). To get it obtain a
collapsable fishing pole, Brell's fishing pole, Hintol's Fishing Pole, and a
Kerran fishing pole, and turn them all in to get your badge.



Step 6:

Take the note to Camia V' Retta in the Enchanter's guild in Neriak, and with
Illusion High Elf up, hand in it and a copy of Illusion: Spirit Wolf. She
will give you 'An illegible enchanter spell'



Step 7:

Now you have to go to Erud's crossing and fish up 'A furry fish scale'. I
averaged one every 17 hours. my fishing skill is 200  and I was using a
blessed fishing pole and high bonus bait.



Step 8:

Place the following items in your enchanter's research book:

An illegible enchanter spell

A furry fish scale

A High Quality Wolf Pelt

An incomplete transcription.

Combine. it's based on research with a 199 trivial. At 200 research I failed
the first 7 combines



You will get 'A slimy green spell scroll' (nodrop, lore)



Step 9:

Go to the Burned Woods (not the Burning Woods, the Burned Woods. As a note,
they are off of Crushbone this week). Camp the level 47 An Moss Snakes, over
by the BBQ'd Treant's Corpse, untill you get the spawn of Icky Poing, a
named gnome that's about the size of a cyclops. He's the quest npc
enchanter. Warning: There is a level 56 rabbit wandering the zone that
appears to be KOS to Icky, and agros from about half the zone away. He's
also kos to enchanters, but no other class, sees through invis and hide, and
quads for about 2000 per hit. You have about 15 seconds usually before he
reaches Icky. However a druid can usually kite him away, and A level 30 or
so necromancer can solo him with little difficulty. Please note that Icky
seems to be KOS to all classes except enchanters, is unrootable, and runs at
Selo's speed.



Illusion: Tree, and hand Icky 'A slimy green spell scroll' and your Master
Baiter Badge. He will hand you your new spell Illusion: Scaled Wolf. Please
note that at this time the spell appears to be bugged and only lists
Shadowknights as a class on the spell. I linked it to one and he said it
indicated he could scribe it at level 8.  I spoke to a GM and he said
'Perhaps you didn't complete the quest right' so I'm still investigating.


Disclaimer: I'm JUST JOKING! IF you didn't figure that out on the first item
list you should be hearily <bonked>
