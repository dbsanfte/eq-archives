Nice to know you think Diablo is a trash game too.

Keep in mind that adding a 1st person view is not trivial. You suddenly need
to worry about rendering objects that are very far away because you can see
to the horizon or the far wall of some of the big dungeon rooms. Given the
complexity of some of the scenes, you'd have to add some artificial clipping
plane which would get very ugly.

You can still complain about them not doing it, but don't assume they didn't
consider it and what they'd have to give up to get it.
