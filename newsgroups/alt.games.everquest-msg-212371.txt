How about Cobalt Scar?  My cleric was soloing wyverns there at 44, and they
didn't cyan out till 54 IIRC, so you should still get exp on them at 53.
Trick is to stand down on the beach and nuke them from there, then back up a
bit while they come down the cliff, so you can play with them on the beach;
assuming you aren't KOS to the otters this guarantees single pulls and no
worries, unless someone is playing with the walrus people.

I'm sure there are better targets out there for you, but my mage isn't
anywhere near that level so I'm erring on the side of pathetically easy.
