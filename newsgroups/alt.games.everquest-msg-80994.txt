As a side project (like we needed one) my partner and I went to a
different server and started two n00b characters from scratch. Having
never played one, I started a chanter.  As usual, I didn't bother wasing
any precious coppers or silvers on additional lvl 1 spells, since
everybody is basically an underpowered tank for the first few levels
anyway. (Or at least can fake it that way.)

Very close to level four. Lot's of interesting, and some class defining
spells come around then. My question is, at that level, are any of the
level one and level four spells worth buying for a chanter? I mean, if
you are with a partner or small group hunting newbie mobs, do you ever
really *need* to mezz or stun them? Or shall I just wait for the higher
power spells in a couple more levels, etc. I shall certainly get invis
and my pet so we have a tank. (Uncontrollable though it may be). But I'd
like some advice on what other low level chanter spells you would deem
critical at level four if you were on a VERY (read about one or two
plat) budget?
