Seems I have the same problem. I have 3 computers networked, and all play
eq. Two of them have no problem seeing the links, but mine ( of course )
shows the item with the item number. Looked at my eqclient.ini but saw no
problems there. Hope to find a solution soon. Oh, btw, the new ui is enabled
on all computers. I can even read my own links, but can't remember which
channels.
Thanks for any input. I see a lot of good info come thru here from a lot of
helpful people. Thanks again.
