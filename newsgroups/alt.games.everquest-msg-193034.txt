<sarcasm on> So I can't have a contest in which the winner gets his
cable tv bill paid for life. If I pick the raffle ticket he bought,
the prize should not be awarded because you pay for cable but didn't
buy a ticket? Buying the ticket was something he happened to do at
some event he happened to go to after all.  <sarcasm off>

He won something because he did something. All the world could have
gone to the fan faire; some did not or arrived too late. ALL the
people at the fan faire could have offered to help judge; some did not
or offered too late. Some who offered to help judge did win the right
to help judge; others lost. Of those that did win the right to help
judge, he won the grand prize of an in-game item. 

He WON --  it's a simple concept. Only a few become finalists in any
contest; of the finalists, only one person wins the grand prize.
Whether you are in the running is your choice determined buy whether
you buy a ticket.  The reward for buying a ticket is not equal for
everyone, only the opportunity to buy it needs to be equal. 

It's not like he got it for paying off someone or ninjaing the loot or
hacking the database. Just send him a tell of "Congrats" and move on.
