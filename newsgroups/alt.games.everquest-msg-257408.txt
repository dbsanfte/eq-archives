  One thing I have noticed over the years is that undeads seem to give more
exp than live mobs, even in the same zone. If your killing in SK, then your
killing the aviaks, centaurs or for most players the gnolls outside paw. In
LOiO a good % of the mobs are undead so they could be the reason your seeing
more exp gain on the lake zone.

  Just my 2cents worth.
