Yea I've been playing this game for 3 years and steadily watched the service
go all to hell, and the game is all screwed up with Luclin now (SoL was the
perfect title for it since I was SoL because my video card that worked fine
for 3 years is "not supported") since they wanted to rush the expansion out
in time to compete with DAoC and have it on shelves before x-mas... even if
it was half finished. So now they're gonna charge me more for less? Goodbye
EQ, been a nice 3 years but it's time to move on.
