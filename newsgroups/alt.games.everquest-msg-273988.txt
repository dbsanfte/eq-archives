Dictionary.com:
Informal. A cat. 
Botany. A fuzzy catkin, especially of the pussy willow. 
Vulgar Slang. 
The vulva. 
Sexual intercourse with a woman. 
Offensive Slang. Used as a disparaging term for a woman. 
Slang. A man regarded as weak, timid, or unmanly. 

Clearly the last derives from the 'vulva' rather than 'cat' sense.  I 
believe the word 'pussy' is also sometimes used to denote a homosexual.

However, if you want to be banned and indulge in self-righteousness, you 
try calling someone 'pusillanimous', which has a different root.  No 
doubt there is a clause in your contract that says the moderators 
decision is final, though, so you will still be shooting yourself in the 
foot!
