You're doing the right thing for the Guardians of Shar Vahl (I think that's
the faction). You can also Multi-quest the newbie quest for good faction.
Get an acrylia slate from Mignah. Have a new character go through the Vah
Shir citizenship quest and turn in the stamped tax document. You can then
turn in your personal acrylia slate to complete that part of the quest.
You'll get back a letter to take to the king for more faction.

This should raise your faction enough to do the Champion's Cloak quest which
gives you a cloak with a faction modifier. I did this with my Iksar
Beastlord who is now an official citizen of Shar Vahl and who's also done
the first few steps of the Vah Shir claw quest.
