Yeah, I did a "my swings" hits box, but my misses still show
up in the original message box too.  Sigh.  Hopefully they'll
fix that PDQ.

I would like "autoattack on" and "autoattack off" messages
to go to the "my swings" box as well. Sometimes it's hard
to tell the "new" swings from the "old" ones as you finish
one kill and start another.
