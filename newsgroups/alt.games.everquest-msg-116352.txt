> So any one have any ideas/suggestions as to where to find them

Firstly, make a hot key that does:

/tracksort normal   (=newest first)
/doability X        (X=location of your Track button)
/pause 20           (give you a chance to read it)
/tracksort distance (=closest first)

Hit this button every time TRACK is available. Yes, that often!
Then have LEV mem'd and keep SoW up.
Whenever a Heretic pops, Lev and run.

Where to look. You need to find a safe spot abouth halfway between the Town
and the Dock, and about halfway between the east and west walls. You will
then be in the middle of the 6 or so spawn points for the Heretics. There
ARE spots where you will get few wanderers, but they are hard to find. Use
Hide/Camo to observe pathing for a while.

There is roughly one heretic spawn per game day (ie 72 minutes) however they
are random in both timing and location. This means you may get 2 close
together, or have to wait 2 hours for the next one. As far as I know killing
any other mobs don't make spawning any more or less likely.

If you are going to do this seriously, then find a safe spot and do nothing
but track. Otherwise, you will pull a Panda or whatever just as one pops -
and remember the Heretics are KoS to most animals and other mobs, so you are
competing against them as well as other players. And don't forget also that
the Sash is the rare reward for the quest. I got mine at the 6th attempt
(yes, 26 heretic heads!). Don't believe any of the tales about collecting
all male or all female heads to make the sash more likely, none of them are
true.

Good luck! I got my sash at 40, and only just upgraded it at 52!
