Good question

Some of the relevant comments snipped from the emails:

"Was out and about and this kept running through my mind - came up with
only one answer - the people here have huge anger problems and seem to
vent that at anybody that doesnt fit their profile, cant say what, that
profile is in their heads, but because there are so many others of
similar mind they can get away with this, as many others just seem to
join in on the act. Once again they would not do this in outside the
comfort zone of there pc with an anamounous (sic) name as it would
probably end as a smack in the mouth."


"They never realise they could be speaking to someone with mental
disability, child or just a very insecure personality and have no
respect for others if this was an "adult" newsgroup they would not dare
for the abuse they would receive."

"Its simple they are complete and utter ******** . Hope that does not
offend but it inflames me that people who ask a simple question suffer
abuse of such nature but of course they do so from behind the mask of
their computer screen, I like you do not understand this childish
behavoiur but I will continue to post my questions yet after seeing
recent posts will not involve my self in conversation. There are people
who you mention who populate the newsgroup who can give constructive
opinion and are also very helpfull, unfortunatly this newsgroup has
become overpopulated with those who lack the intelligence."
