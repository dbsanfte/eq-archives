 No but I have traveled the breadth of Antonica AND Kunark to collect
Runes and the research materials to make Runes and the spells I needed
as a young Wizard. I even walked from Freeport to the Gypsy camp in NK
by myself, stopping in EC to kill wisps as a level 12 to get my first 
Concordance of Research. I must have died 10 times to those damned 
lions but I finally got that damned Concordance   8^)

 Not for Wizzies. Nearly every decent item I've recieved has been
through quests. The stuff that does drop for Wizards are few and far
between let me tell you.

 Add to that the Coldain Prayer Shawl quest. Just finished the 5th.
