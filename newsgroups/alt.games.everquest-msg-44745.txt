Actually Internet Explorer does not support alpha blending 
transparancies in PNG images. IE6 has nice CSS support, however it does 
not support CSS3 standards, the only browser I know of that does 
currently is Mozilla ;) Just simple little things, but very nice 
features that make my life easier and the page look much better and more 
interactive with the style.
