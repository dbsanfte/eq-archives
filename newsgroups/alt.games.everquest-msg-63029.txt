A company with a few hundred thousand players is going to have a rather
diverse set of hardware that their software runs on.  As time progresses,
their game can either go extinct or attempt to keep current.

This expansion is going to be radical in graphics support.  To streamline
the efforts, they are requiring all users to use the new DX8 standard vs the
older DX7 version.  This isn't the first time they have requested their
users to stay up to date with Direct X versions nor, I suspect, will it be
the last.

The new expansion will increase the quantity and type of items that can be
displayed.  This is required so that the older users can see and work with
new items that are from the new expansion -- you are looking at now a 4th
generation of software (EQ, Kunarak, Velious, Lucil) attempting to show it's
new items to 1st generation software users.  This requires some changes to
the 1st gen's layout so they are requiring those changes.

As for glitches, I have NO doubts we'll hit some rough spots once it rolls
out but not the kind you are talking about.  Again, I'd suspect the
underlying support software instead of the game.

Your blue screen issue sounds like something is starting to fail on the
system.  Sporadic failures are a pain to deal with.

As for "out to get folks", doubt it.  You are giving their programmers WAY
to much credit on hardware/software config detection as well as the psychic
software that looks around the house and determines "I'll lower this guys
speed, he ain't worth much...". <grin>

Best of luck.
