I apologize for starting a new thread on this, as I saw it mentioned
somewhere else, but I can't find it again.

Somewhere in here, it was mentioned that a lower level character could
raise his or her skills by fighting a high level PC or their pet.  I
was just given a MoSS and have a total of 3 in 1hb.  This, at level
16, is not a good thing if you want to live soloing, or get invited
back into a group.  Therefore, my question is --  Do I have to battle
the PC or the pet, and does it need to be in a duel, or in a PvP
arena?  I also want to increase some other lagging skills as well.
My best RL friend has a level 57 Necro and his pet is WAYYYYYY red to
me, so if this works, We'd be delighted to spend a few hours in combat
together.  He just spends all his time in Skyfire anyway.  (Man I'm
glad I have some options on what to do at my lower level)

Thank you,

Gwinaxath, Shadow Knight of Neriak
