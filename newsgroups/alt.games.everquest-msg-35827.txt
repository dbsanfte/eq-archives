#1: Exactly how does my playing skill relate to my inclination to petition
any
name that violates my guideline?  How do you know anything about my playing
skill in the first place?

#2: It is the right of any player to petition any name that violates his
guideline.  Each player's guideline is a personal choice.  The GM is the
final arbiter on petitions, not the involved players.

#3: I am not always right.  I did not say I am always right.  I'll thank you
not to put words in my mouth.


We have unfinished business, Brat.  You began issue #1 when you insulted my
playing skill and claimed a link existed between my supposed lack of skill
and tattle-tale behavior.  You began Issue #2 when you asked, "Who gave you
that right [to judge and report names]?"  You began Issue #3 when you said
that we, the regulars in this NG, needed to "pound it into those cloned
little minds of yours that you're not always right."  Now you get to put
your money where your mouth is and finish those issues.  I'm GIVING YOU the
last word.  Whatever you post in answer to this, I'll consider it the end of
the debate between us.

I owned up where I was wrong.  I restated my remaining arguments so that
they couldn't be twisted and then I gave you three days to answer them.  The
gauntlet has been thrown and it's starting to gather dust.  You are overdue
to provide one or more of the following for each of items one through three:
a) a concrete answer; b) a refutation not including character insults; c) an
apology; d) an admission of wrong.
