I have collected just about every items and am about ready to work on
the ring quest all the way to quest #7 except for one thing: I have
killed probably 100's of Tundra Kodiak in EW and not a single high
quality pelt have dropped.  That's about 6 hours that I could have
spent in PoV grinding XP and AA.  Bazaar have them but the cheapest is
5000pp each and I need 2.

Why must the pelt in the very first part of the quest be that hard to
find?  I have left hundreds of high quality cougarskin, several
assorted heads, and more to rot yet no high quality kodiak pelt.  To
make things worse, you can still fail at making the blanket even if
the tailor skill is up over 150 (trivial is 41 I think) and when it
fails, you have just wasted umpteen hours.

</rant>

And to that seller of those 5K pelts, if they sell out, I will buy
that 10Kpp fruit juice from the same seller :P
