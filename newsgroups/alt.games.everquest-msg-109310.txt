They're advancing their characters outside the rules of the game. It's
as much cheating as, say, using a Game Genie (for those who remember
them) on a Nintendo game.

No, it's NOT a valid comparison since the rules don't forbid the
activity. In EQ, they do.

Once again, not a valid comparison since there are no rules against
it.
