I always found it handy when either using root/dot to kill or just trying
to med in a zone full of those annoying cats who will attack you no
matter what. Also helped with the root/dot because the cats wouldn't
attack me, but people could still see me and know the mob was engaged. 

Also works on Griffs, which can come in handy :)
