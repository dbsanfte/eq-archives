Thanks for the comments everyone.  I feel better about now that I've from
other minds.  I have been leary of using the "Beat other groups mobs" for
skill raises because I've been too paranoid about not being in their
communication loop in case a pull goes bad.  If I play tonite, it'll be with
just one gnoll:  that way the hill campers only have to give up one gnoll,
and i get my skills :)

If you play on Druzzil Ro, and happen to see a Dwarf sitting close to an
indecisive gnoll who is low on health, please don't kill him...at that point
in time, he'll be my bestest friend :)
