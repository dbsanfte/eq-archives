What about "buy-a-level"?

Your toon is already 30, but your buddies are 40+? $30 gets you a 25%
increase in levels

To reach 60, you'd have to already be 48.... to hit 48, you'd already have
to be 38 +2 yellow bubbles, etc.

To get a char that just dinged 10 upto 59 +3 bubbles would take 8 boosts,
costing $240... coincidentally, that's about what a stripped lvl 55+ would
cost on PA


Personally, I could live with that... EBayers would still get their uber
toons, but they'd be their OWN toons, so less chance of scams... casual
gamers would get their 'catch-up' to stay in touch with their buddies... and
Verant would make some cash (and hopefully put some of it back into CS)
