I would also suggest that you make sure you have the latest drivers for your
motherboard.  I had a similar problem with a new PC playing DAoC a while
back.  I updated to the newest drivers for the MB, and everything cleared up
nicely.

As for video drivers, if you want to experiment a bit, try www.guru3d.com  I
found some beta drivers there at one time that solved a huge lag problem I
was having.  They also have a tool to remove all traces of an old driver
installation.  Helps start with a clean slate.

Best of luck,
