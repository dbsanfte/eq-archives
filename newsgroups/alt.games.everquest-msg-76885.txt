You can probably but it at the everquest site (the Station). You'll pay
a fortune for delivery (about 30 quid prolly), but the only other option
is to trawl around the US software sites until you find one with
relatively cheap overseas delivery.

The easiest option is to have it sent to a US friend/guildie, who then
mails it to you. If you have broadband, get someone to put up an image
of their eq folder (minus the junk like bmps) for you to download, then
they only have to e-mail you the account number from the box, rather
than a physical CD.

Beats me why VI don't sell account keys online, even if they don't want
to set the whole cd up for DL because of bandwidth issues
