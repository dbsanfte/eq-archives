Tell him there's a lot more classes than just warrior and he should try
another.  Preferably something totally different from warrior...any caster
that gets spells at level 1.

He should also research any class that he's chosen to know what he has to
look forward to.  If he's depressed in the game it's his problem, not the
game's so his choices are all his...quit or try something else.  The game
ain't gonna change.
