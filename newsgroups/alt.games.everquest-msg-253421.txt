Its not exactly common useage but its not obsolete nor slang. 'To treat 
with' means 'to deal with'. Typically within the context of a 
negotiation of terms for something ... as in literally 'to make a deal'. 
But any sort of negotiation would qualify... including determining loot 
scheme, group member roles, pulling order/strategy, etc... ie most any 
interaction in EQ involves treating [or dealing] with other players.

Words that come from the same derivative meaning include 'treaty', and 
'entreat'.
