Hurumph.

The oops you died while quitting fairy has visited me * and I have lost
all of my equipment on my (just) 29 druid. So I am now the prowd owner
of a FS hammer, 3 backpacks and 141pp.

I am (currently) a very infrequent player and tend towards short
sesions, so I play a druid so I can solo (Rather than joining groups
only to leave them). What I am looking for is recomendations on how to
re-equip my halfling druid either in short camps or via pp and buying. 

I was thinking of going to the warrens to toast the low level Mobs for
bronze and molars to build pp. Any better ideas ?

And what equipment should I be aiming for ? What are the cheap
alternatives to get me started ? Oh the pain of it all.

Any help would be most useful,

Cheers,

Jim


* I dont get to play often and it looks like I died a bout a month ago.
The log file is not clear so I think that I must have /q instead of
camping. That or some sort of bug eat me.
