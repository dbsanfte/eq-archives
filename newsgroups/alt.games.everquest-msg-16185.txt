The AC still spawns in EK.  Any zone that has Cyclops on the spawn table
can spawn the AC.  I'm guessing that WK won't spawn it because its just
broon and choon.  but EK has a wandering "a cyclops"  and the AC is on
the spawn table, There was a point, where the spawn got messed up, and
every cyclops spawn in EK was the AC.
