    Gotta love the "I wanna pull even though I have no idea of how to do
so" folks, eh?

   You gotta wonder what he's thinking at this point.  "Oh no, I'm going to
die!  Well, the least the Bez dude can do is die with me, dammit!  Hey, he
left me alone to die!  He doesn't care if I die or not!  Bastage!"

  Wonder how much time he spent in the Paladral Caverns screaming for a
rez.

   And this is the point that you wish you afford to kick the git out and
still win, without awarding him any points.  Or I would in your shoes.  It
just was very annoying to me when the person who was directly responsible
for causing much of the problems suddenly declares that things are too
screwed up to continue.

   As a cleric, this was actually my favorite time.  The time I had to
really pay attention, to make sure that every heal wasn't wasted or landed
too late.  The time I got to shine.

    Of course, long before this, it is apparent that he really doesn't know
much of what he speaks.

    This is what I miss most about EQ, and what kept me playing as long as
I did.  I love the urgency and teamwork that came from doing a well done
but difficult LDON.  I just always thought that they were fun, as long as
there was some sort of teamwork going on.  If I could just do those,
without having to farm cash for decent equipment and dots, I'm pretty sure
I would still be playing.

  Nice story, Mr. Tape.  Or should I just call you Duct?
