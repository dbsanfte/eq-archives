Get your guild to HoT early after a patch, pharm HoT for a bit of armour
while you wait, and you can pretty much guarantee you will see doze and all
HoT named mobs before you go to bed

I know they added the random factor, but...
my guilds been pharming Doze recently, seens as assholes train us when we
try "their" NToV and we got sick of the bs (another guild previously thought
of as no-hopers in nTov killed lord vyemm the other day though which will
make things interesting)

Anyway on patch day Doze has been up every single time, the same day, after
every single patch since the change
