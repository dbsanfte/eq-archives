    Sorry about the implosion of your guild, Eric.  The last two EQ
guilds I was in under went a similar thing, though those were only small
family guilds to start with.  I felt kinda bad about it at the time, and
I should think that it would be worse for someone who had been in an up
and coming active raiding guild.
