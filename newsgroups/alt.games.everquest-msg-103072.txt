The Out Of Character channel is there for any and all to use for Out Of
Character conversations.  You have the ability to filter out the entire
channel, or to simply /ignore the people you don't wish to hear.  You are
the on with a problem, not them.  If I find any of the communication
channels to be bothersome to me, I turn them off, it's really quite simple.
