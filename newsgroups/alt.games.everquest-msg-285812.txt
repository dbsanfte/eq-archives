Ecclesiastes 3
 1To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the 
heaven:
 2A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck 
up that which is planted;
 3A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to 
build up;
 4A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
 5A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time 
to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
 6A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast 
away;
 7A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to 
speak;
 8A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
