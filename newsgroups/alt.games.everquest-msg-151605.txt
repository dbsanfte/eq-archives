Um, you do know that someone did buy the London Bridge, don't you?  Well,
the outer covering of the Second stone London Bridge.  The first one was
just demolished completely.  The second one had the outer covering stones
sold, and they were placed over a modern bridge in Lake Havasu, Arizona.
There is, of course, now a new London Bridge in London.
