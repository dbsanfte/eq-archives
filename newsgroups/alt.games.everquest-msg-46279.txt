Ok so I tell my children, if it's time to die so be it. I am not going to
try and prevent harm, or protect you. I will simply accept us all dying at
the hand of terrorists. To simply try and warn others with information and
tools I have found, I should have kept it to myself so people like you could
feel better? Sorry but you have no case. You can call me a fool but history
is full of nay sayers who didn't head events that were in their face. You
sir are one of them IMHO.
