The funny thing is, it doesn't fully work for either of those.  If the post
is innocuous, it might not be quoted, and so is indeed not in the archives.
However, if anyone disagrees, they quote the parts they disagree with, and
those show up.

Given that my posts will end up in Google no matter what I do, I'd rather
have my side in there unedited, rather than only be represented through the
filter of my opponents and enemies.
