Hmmm, guess it's time to trade _my_ toes in for new ones.  OTOH, I doubt
that it matters a whole heckuva lot just how "perfect" you get the gear
on a twink in his 20s (or 30s for that matter).  I'd guess the biggest
problem he's likely to have is finding groups to learn his role in.
Even now he can probably xp fairly easily solo, and once he hits 29 he
can likely xp faster solo than in a group, depending on the availability
of suitable hunting grounds.  Actually, given the anti-wiz bias in the
general player community and his experience with other characters he
might just want to solo on up a ways while observing other wizards in
groups/raids with his main until he reaches a point where he's high
enough to group with friends and practice the things he's seen work for
others.
