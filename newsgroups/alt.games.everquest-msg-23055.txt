Well, you've read what I've done so far and still it never worked.
I tried the latest Detonator 3 drivers even. I'm really starting to
believe that there is no way for that card to co-exist with
EverQuest.

Instead of fighting with it I just returned it and picked up the
ATI RADEON 64mb card. I've never had problems with
ATI in the past and so far its performance has blown
nvidia's GeForce2 out of the water.

I'm really starting to think that EverQuest has a REAL problem
with the newer 64mg cards. Granted they are OpenGL, but
they are still D3D compliant. ATI is as well, but since my little
try-out I've noticed a lot of differences.

One of the major differences was the Character select screen.
Using the GeForce2 64mg card, my computer actually SLOWED
down to a crawl! Basically when the character rotated, he hardly
spinned! Also the music that is played during it was slowed down
BIG TIME. Also, not to mention the 45 minutes of game play before
a horrid screen freeze.

Since the ATI Radeon card, the character select screen resembles
a cross between EQ and the movie Twister! Sound is great also.
I've yet to fully test whether or not it will crash, but my guess is that
it wont. We shall see tonight after work.

One thing that really helped me pick out a card was the list of
supported cards on the EQ site. You'll notice a slew of cards
for 3dfx, as well as ATI being supported. Skip down and the
list gets really slim. 3dfx cards (Voodoo etc..) were built on Glide.
Which isn't industry standard. OpenGL and Direct 3d (D3D) are.
Another issue with 3dfx is that they sold their company to Nvidia.
Nvidia is now taking care of all 3dfx developement. What does this
mean for the consumer?

This means that there are no new 3dfx cards! So if you want to purchase
a card specifically to enhance your EQ gaming you have one choice!
An older 3dfx card!!! Nvidia hasn't made any new ones yet based on
the Glide arpeture!

Also, EQ will always be based on Glide. Just read the FAQs. If it was
based on OpenGL, EQ could be a cross platform game. Readily available
for Linux or Mac if they were ported.

I would suggest for any consumers looking to purchase a new card for
EQ to select some of the newer cards from ATI. Or maybe just wait
for Nvidia to continue 3dfx's cards.
