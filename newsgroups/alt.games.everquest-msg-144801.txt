Not really.  Kill orcs for HHK faction.  Running through EK and NK 
without seeing anybody is a breeze.  Especially by level 20.  Never had 
a problem with gather shadows dropping, but then I avoid as much as 
possible to begin with and refresh it whenever I zone, or have been 
running for awhile and come to a nice empty place.  You could even take 
the MT route.  Refresh gather shadows before you zone in and there's no 
bloody way it should break before you get through the, what, 10 second 
run from zone to zone?  Refresh again and get past guards at entrance.  
Run to stone wall, refresh again, run past guards.  Dunno if the gobbies 
in RE would bother you still but heck, refresh again when you zone in 
and do yet another 10 second run through the zone, then keep high up the 
left wall in the Gorge and the only thing that'll notice you is gonna be 
evil eyes which are so camped they rarely get a chance to move that far.  
Then, once again, all you've got to do is get through EK and NK.  Easily 
done.  Once you get to the NK spires, get your gem, then cast gather 
shadows to avoid the attention of any wandering guards or griffons and 
wait for port.  Voila.

skipping the run back)
