I have the same problem with 768 DDR Ram, Palimino 1900 Xp running at
1.7ghz and a GeForce Ti 2 overclocked. Would have thought that would
be a powerful enough system. Running XP. Tried texture caching on, and
off, but makes no difference. I still suffer the pausing, although
it's not every few seconds, it's more like a brief pause every minute
or so. I didn't have this pre-Luclin. Seems worse in some zones than
others.
