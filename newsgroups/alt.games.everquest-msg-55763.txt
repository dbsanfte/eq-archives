  Interesting, that's good to hear.  Hopefully EQ's switch to DX8 won't
inexplicably cause new issues, though.  I had DX7 installed on my system
before EQ made the required switch to DX7 and everything was working fine
until the fateful DX7 patch.

  Well, it won't be "primarily" used for EQ, but not much of what I will be
using it for can't be handled by Windows 9x.  But I do want the stability
and reliability of the NT core.  Of course, if EQ is particularly unstable
under NT/2000/XP, then I guess that removes that particular benefit.  Still
I don't know if I want to go to those extents (change the OS I was planning
on using or setting up a dual boot) just to play EQ.  I don't have a
copy/license of Windows 9x/Me that I could use on the new system, and I'd
prefer not having to spend an extra hundred dollars on one (or pirating
one), especially since basically every new computer sold off the shelf is
going to be running XP, and EQ should be expected to work with it,
especially by the time my system is built and I'm playing EQ again.

  If it's just a matter of immature drivers for certain hardware, I'd prefer
to avoid that hardware, if at all possible, without compromising the overall
quality of the system too much.  If it's a matter of EQ not playing nice
with XP... well, that's something Verant is going to HAVE to work on if they
want to get new customers and preserve a portion of their own playerbase.

 Right, I'll keep that in mind. :)
