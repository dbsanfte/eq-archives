What's a good place for a 51 cleric to solo for experience? I can get
KEI to speed things up, if needed, though if so loot should cover costs.

Last night I was soloing the skellie ruins in Dreadlands, earned around
2.5 blue in a couple of hours, but the fact that about half the MOBs I
was killing were light blue didn't speed things up any. I visited Kithicor
a few nights ago (since it's supposed to have really nasty undead at night)
but everything I conned was either light blue or green.

Tragic story: I got my Beginners Magic Manual last night; went to Bazaar and
bought a Hobgoblin Surprise for 200 plat then went to turn it in for the
quest... and found I had gotten hungry on the way. I had a stack of
summoned food, way down at the end of my inventory...

It's a really nice item for the effort and cost involved. +6 WIS in range
slot? Sign me up! Mentioned it to my guild and somebody else did it minutes
later. :-) The Intermediate manual looks much tougher, unfortunately.
