That's hard to guess. Each zone is different, after all. In zones like
OT the money comes almost completely from coin. In places like
oldschool Guk and SolB a much higher percentage came from fine steel
weapons. In Umbral amost all of it comes from vendor gems, but in many
other places in luclin the mobs drop good coin and nothing else.

If I were forced to take a guess, thinking back to group loot
distribution after the main looter sells and splits, I think money
from items outstrips coin, but not by much until the very end when you
are hunting nothing but things with good gems.

Over the life of a character? I'd say 60% vendor items, 40% coin, and
a very miniscule amount of quest rewards.

Before Hate, money income was out of control (the storebought steel
weapons in Oot and BB being primarily to blame). Back then I'd say it
was more like 80% items. After the planes were put in, but before gem
drops became common, was the height of coin loot's ratio, I think.
