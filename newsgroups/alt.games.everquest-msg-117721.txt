Another new zone on Stormhammer.

http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4310

The Jaggedpine Forrest.  I'm assuming that this is off of Surefall
Glade, but what would the Duke of Below be doing there?

And did we ever get that Pirate zone in Timorious Deep that the
Stormhammer guys got?  Considering both my druid and ranger are
Surefall based and are on Jaggedpine faction, I hope we actually SEE
this new zone.
