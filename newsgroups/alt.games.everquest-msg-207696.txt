> Anyone else notice a slight speeding up of MOBS?

Something seems different.  I did the last 80% of 56 alternating two guards
in Katta (the ones outside Nathyn Illuminious's place) (not quite enough
mana to comfortably multikite) and all of 57 alternating between tri-kiting
those two guards along with one from inside, and dual-kiting the two sonic
guard wolves (occasionally adding another guard from inside thrown in to
either of those).  (Good spot, BTW...spawn time is fast enough that when I'm
FM, stuff is up, still blue at 58, only faction that goes down is for those
guard and wolves and Nathyn, 4-8 plat per guard adds up, almost no danger
while medding so going AFK is safe, almost no competition...I can do a level
there with about 35 hours /played).

I got to 86% of the way through 57 before the patch, and did the rest of 57
there last night (ding!), which took a little under 4 hours.

Anyway, I'm pretty used to the relative speed of myself and the mobs there,
because a couple things I do depends criticially on running to get far
enough ahead of them to do something.  For example, here is how I do 3
guards:

1. Cast Eye of Tallon, send it to open the door, go in, and target a guard
that is visible from outside when the door is open.  Dismiss the eye.

2. Run forward clicking Staff of Temperate Flux until I'm in range.  That
hits that inside guard.  (I do this before the door closes, although it
turns out there is no need...you can cast through a closed door!)

3. Target a guard outside the door and wait for the outside guards to aggro.
The usually aggro soon.  However, if the door opens (it closes before the
inside guard gets to it, so he has to open it again), and they have not
aggroed, I use SoTF to aggro them.

4. Run across to the open area in front if the building with the baking
merchants.  Circle around there a couple times on the west side of that area
to get them gathered together.

5. When I've got them all together, run East.  When I get to the entrance to
that triangular area, I turn and snare.

Before the patch, at this point they were far enough away that I had no
worry when doing this.  Now, when I turn and snare, they are close enough
that I worry that they might get to me before the spell goes off.  I now run
farther into the triangular area to be safe.

I don't know if this is a speed increase for the mobs, a slowdown for my
jboots, something making my snare cast slower (I did do the quest for the
Beginner's Magic Manual just before the patch, replacing my Student's
Homework...but Student's Homework doesn't have any focus effects), or a
pathing change in Katta (there are a couple places where, if you circle with
a mob, they will go off at an angle...so depending on which direction you
are circling, that either makes them go farther away than they should be, or
makes them take a shortcut through your circle rather than follow you).

I'll investigate further, since I plan to spend much of 58 there (getting a
little bored...but I can do a level in two weeks of simply playing there
while I watch "Star Trek" after work plus a few hours on the weekends).  In
particular, I'll see what happens when I try to quad, since my quadding
procedure starts out like the procedure for getting three, except at step 5,
it become this:

5. Run East, and then go around the back of the building, and run West along
the back.  This gets me (before the patch, at least!) far enough ahead that
I can run into Nathyn's area, open the door, target a fourth guard, zap him
with my staff, and run back out to the baking building area, just as the
other three are getting to the entrance of that area.  I pass there just
before they are close enough to hit me, and then it is like step #4 with
three, except now I've got four.

So, if mobs really are faster, step #5 for quadding will have me running
right into three angry guards.  That will be hard to miss. :-)

(I usually just do three, because there is a warping problem with four.
Several times, when doing four, three of them suddenly warp to right on top
of me, and the fourth disappears.  I kill the three, and minutes later, the
fourth comes wondering in from god knows where (long after my snare should
have expired...but he's still snared!?).  I've never seen any oddity with
three, other than some areas where the pathing diverges in such a way that
if the three aren't *exactly* on top of each other, they'll get split if I
run them over those areas).
