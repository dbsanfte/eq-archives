Verant has shown they can put multiple ports on a pad, so I'd love to see:

Pad 1: NK and WC
Pad 2: Toxx and Greater Fay
Pad 3: GD and CS
Pad 4: DL and 1 way to EJ (essentially an Evac)

The large continents each get 2 spots, and the small continents get 1 each.
Would still be a pain for a melee to go from Seb to the moon (can't see a
scion sitting in EJ), but would make travel much easier all around.
