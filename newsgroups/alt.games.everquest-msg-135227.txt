I'm wondering why they couldn't break up the download into sections so you
can download it in parts.  Do this over a week's time (say breaking it up to
7 parts, one new part each day).  Then on the seventh day, release the file
that activates the new GUI and installs everything.  Wouldn't this help in
relieving the congestion?
