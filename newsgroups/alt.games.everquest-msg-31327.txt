I have been trying for the ring also, for the past few weeks.  I usually
stop in at the beginning or end of my EQ night and spend an hour or so.  I
have sat there up to 5 hours at a time and only got him once.  Damn thing
only had a copper ring - no platninum =(
The next time that I go to camp him - I am going to make sure that I can sit
there 10 hours if need be - I am not leaving without my ring.
