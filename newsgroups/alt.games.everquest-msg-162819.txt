Absolutely correct.  Respecting "first come first served" is
a courtesy among the player community (and under ordinary
circumstances, a good one), not anything that the GMs or
"the Rules" enforce.

In fact, "the Official Rules" included the "PnP" (Play Nice
Policy), which says that if there's any dispute over a
mob or camp, you *must* share, or work out some workable
agreement.


> and GMs  do care about that. ??

Technically, yes. KS'ing is a bannable offense.  In practice,
they usually have better things to do than listen to
accusations and counteraccusations of KS'ing.  Their usual
statement is, "we have to see it happen or we can't
do anything about it".  Needless to say, they aren't
going to sit there for half an hour with you guys just
to watch what happens when the spawn pops.

So don't hold your breath waiting on a GM to help you
on this.

They'll tell you what I've told you.  It's official policy.

It's not.

Here's my advice:  Turn on all melee/spellcasting messages,
if you have some filtered off (most people do).  Then when
Hadden pops, do your damnedest to get the first hit/spell
in.  Your message box will show whether you actually got
the first hit in, or whether the other guy did.  If you
got the first, feel free to kill off the mob and loot it.
If he got first blood, back off and let him have it, better
luck next time.

If there's any dispute and a GM gets involved, you can scroll
back to the part of your log which shows the first hit(s),
do a /report on it, and that will save a copy of the record
for the GM to examine as evidence.

Either that, or just say "screw it" and go after the many 
other perma-enduring-breath items that are now available
in the game.  The Fishbone Earring used to be pretty much
the only one.  Now there are many other options.

The easiest/quickest to get, if you are of appropriate
level, or have friends who are, is the quest in Katta
Castellem that gives an EB neck item in exchange for
three Shissar Organs from the snake guys in The Grey.
Folks hunt these snakes for exp pretty much continuously,
and the organs drop frequently (and rot a lot, since
anyone who wants the neck item gets it within hours
of their first Grey expedition).  The only catch
is that you need EB to survive in The Grey in the first
place.  Either borrow an EB item, bring a friend who
can cast it, have a Mage summon you a pile of Waterstones,
or buy a backpack of Fishgill Extract from any potion
vendor NPC.

Even at low level, if you can survive the trip to/across
the Grey to the edge of the Temple, most folks hunting
the snakes would be happy to let you loot the organs
that are rotting.  They can also be multiquested, so
if you can manage to snag one (say, by the zone line),
a high-level friend could collect two others for you
and you could get your EB neck item that way (he turns
in 2, you turn in the third and get the reward).
