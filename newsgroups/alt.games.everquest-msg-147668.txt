Righto, then. Why not a MotD for all the people who have been murdered
on the streets every day by gangs? Or for the ones who suffer
terrorism in other countries? Victems of road rage, anyone? Drunk
Drivers? People die at the hands of other people every day. A MotD in
EQ is not necisary or even entirely appropriate.

Here's a better way to memorialize the events: Stand up for these
things every day instead of just when something bad happens. You don't
need a certain anniversary to show unity.

And you still assume that where I am now is where I've always been,
thus parading blatant ignorance. YOu assume that I don't have friends
or family in these countries. You assume that just because I'm in
America, I have nothing to fear.......

Nice comeback.... Did you even bother to read it and THINK? Or are you
too busy telling us what "un-American cocksuckers" we all are for
being disgusted at the blatant commercial ploys to tug at our
heartstrings and win customer customers over with staged shows of
sympathy?
