I didn't realize Sweden was a third world country. Maybe I should have been
clearer. none the less it does not detract from the gist of the point.
Ignorance plays a large role in misuse of technology. I don't consider the
Swedish population to be ignorant, even though i feel your points in this
rebuttle are.

It must be entertaining as a spectator to not really ever have to have dealt
with terrorism yourself, to sit there and judge me and the USA.

I can't recall when a terrorist act in the past has ever leveled 4 city
blocks, and significantly damaged 8 more. As well as dropping 2 110 story
state of the art sky scrapers.

None the less, America is now part of the list of nations affected by
terrorism, and we are adjusting to our new environement as well as coming
out to try and deal with it so little nations like Sweden don't start
speaking Arabic in the future, just like we helped prevent you from speaking
German in the past...

I can however see how you would find this all very entertaining, which is
sad.
