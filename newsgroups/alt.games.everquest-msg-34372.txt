Of course, they're not a tough fight for a druid, since you have lots of
nice mana-efficient anti-summoned nukes (ward summoned at your level?).

I'll repeat my standard answer to what to hunt at level 19 though. Get
thee to South Karana, get in an aviak group and hunt these for a few
levels (start out on egrets and darters at your level - you have harmony
to pick and choose the pulls), then gnolls outside Paw in low 20s, then
inside Paw at 25 or so - these mobs often drop a few plat and other
goodies like gems, words and FS weapons (OK, bronze on the Aviaks).
