The key you have in your sentence is "most" group situations.  But its
the dynamic group situation that all those "that spell book" skills
come to play.  You remark with disdain about your heal... My
beastlords heal max 428 (and I get that at 62) has pulled us out of a
tight position... Main Healer had a fizzle, and the time was not there
to pull off a save..  
The thing to remember is... you are a Hybrid, some of the best skills
of both worlds... but being the best skills, you are NOT the best at
those skills.  It is the fine print not read at the bottom of the
contract.   
But, along that stance, a Warrior cannot bring heals, on call stuns,
Lay of Hands, or lull to the table...   Just as a Cleric cannot bring
Taunt, and meat shield to the table.

If you feel that the only thing a pally / SK brings to the table is a
better holding of aggro... then you are sadly mistaken about the
class.  They are way more than one trick ponies.

LoL, the fatalist role is going well now..   Ya, that's right, there
is no need for an off tank... there is no need for stuns on a caster,
there is no need for your heals, there is no need for your lull, there
is no need for the class to breathe.... 
ahh but there is a desire for your heals, stuns, off tanking, lull,
and a desire for you to breathe
