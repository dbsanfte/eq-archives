Well if you remember some years ago, it was possible to form 7 man groups
using the exploit. This goes to show you that it isn't as difficult as you
think. Haven't tried that exploit in ages, dunno if it still works.

SOE's reasoning is "the game was designed for 6 man groups". But... whats to
stop a raidgroup from camping the same camp? Absolutely nothing, if they
really want it they can take it. The camps and XP will limit the group types
themselves. So there is really no reason for SOE to force this thru design
code.
