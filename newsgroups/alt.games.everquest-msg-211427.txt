I know it's a serious accusation.  I have reported this person to Sony
and I have gone anonymous to the point that it's irriatating to my
guild and others I play EQ with.  At level 62, there's not many zones
to choose from and it's very easy for a level 65 to find you.  

Someone said that the 2 kids he was talking to were probably his
friends.  First, I don't talk to my friend like he was talking to
those two kids.  Second, I certainly wouldn't be having a conversation
like that in open Say while sitting behind several doors nobody hardly
goes into.  I overheard the conversation while trying to sell and I
had to open several doors in the area before I found them.  Finally,
when I told the two people he was talking with to put him on ignore
and go away, they did just that.  If they were his friends, they would
have stayed.  

He has been reported...several times yet he continues to find me
everywhere I am and won't leave me alone.   This was the only other
course of action I knew of to make it known about this person.  I'm
sure people make all kind of snotty posts on here that make the honest
posts seem dishonest.  That was a chance I was willing to take.  

As for bizbee's post, I don't think I've seen anything but snottiness
or anger from you in these forums.  Also, since when does a person
have to live in the forums on a daily basis in order to make a report
such as this?  I'm just saying this is what happened and I'm tired of
being harassed by this individual in the game.  With someone following
you around, there is a fine line on what can be reported and the
action taken by Sony.
