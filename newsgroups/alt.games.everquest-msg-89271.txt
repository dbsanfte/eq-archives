DAMN, wish cobalt was at those prices on my server. Gloves/arms/boots 
are 3-5K, and got those for my warrior, am looking for bracer at the 
moment, auctioning 12K cash for them, then had a guy trying to get 30K 
fo them, thats WAY over what i wanna pay for a bracer (single one, not a 
pair).


> Fungi tunics (were up to 27k after luclin "nerf", now back down around 22k)


Had to pay 30 for mine, still sell for 30-35 on my server. Still dont 
think that a small "nerf" like that should warrant a 10K price increase, 
but what the hell, needed one.

> Jade reavers (epic ripoff bastards) (every time I've seen one for sale it's
> been around 30k or more)


Hehe, seem them for 18 on my server, but still a lot of money for a epic 
drop that are reasonably easy to get.
Just need to convince my guild to go to CoM (hehe, need 4 epic pieces 
now, jade reaver one of them, believe it or not).
