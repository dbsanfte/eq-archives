They are one of the most important characters in the game 50 plus
and you can't do some encounters without them, at all.

Their main role 50 plus is slow, slow, slow, slow and then when in
doubt slow. They also malo (which is lower the mobs res) so the slow
and other spells can stick. They also die a lot since those 2 types of
spells are huge taunt, though not as much if they really go for AC.
Unlike a class like a druid which goes for wis/mana more when in doubt
a shaman goes for max AC. Most of its best ac stuff like planes of
velious armor also has good wis and mana though so it works out.

You are right about the offensive line of spells for soloing, even
dots. When grouping basically they don't heal at all or cast damage
spells, its all just debuff and slow. Ideally a chanter is around who
quickens the tanks but the shaman is the one who slows. Chanter is
okay on lower stuff in a pinch to slow but on higher stuff with his
much lower AC he is going to fold like a paper doll.

Even in like six person groups the shaman does the same thing. I was
in one in icewell when first got velious and the cleric did his thing
of course, chanter mez/clarity/ quicken tanks/, my druid was backup
healer/fast cast healer (chlor heal is quite nice if you know the
complete might not make it in time) DS'er, warrior and monk did their
thing and shaman was the debuffer/slower/guy who got beat on a lot
mainly. There is no way our chanter could have taken the hits from
that stuff in icewell that slowing would have got him. Sometimes we
barely kept him alive mezzing an add.
