All battle messages, yes, but you can separate other categories
of messages (spells, /gu, /auction, etc.) each to their own
windows, or groups of them to a given window, etc.

And you can have many text windows.

I wouldn't want my battle messages to be separated anyway
(e.g. my hits to one window, hits on me to another).  They
are more easily analyzed at a glance if they're intermingled.
For example, that way I can tell if I'm hitting the mob
more often than it's hitting me, etc.
