All copies of XP have it.
The only version that do not are corporate volume licenses for the
obvious reasons (tracking 5000 CD keys to 5000 computers would be
fairly stupid amount of extra work on a sysadmin especially given that
the VAST majority of windows pirating isn't done at the corporate
level, but at the smaller shops and the "casual" pirates that buy one
copy and install it on X number of machines at home and friends).
