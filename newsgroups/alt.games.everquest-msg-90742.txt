Oh sh*t think I'll leave the shadows in Twilight well alone then, they are
an undercon anyway with 150pnt Life taps (and you all know how often
NPC/Mobs proc) I often thought they weren't regaining the health they'd

Hmmm, actually, seeing as I now have Heavy Dragonlegs I no longer need the
Mark of Archery to quest for some AC14 legs :�)
