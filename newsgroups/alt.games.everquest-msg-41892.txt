Except that I am not leaving out a part of the concept of TCC. Sure, they
thought it would stop inappropriately high level farming. But the thing is
what is the difference between the single level 50+ character farming and
the person that has a level 20 character and a level 50 character to
protect it. We all see and know the tactics to PL a character. These rare
items that are being farmed (for which I actually believe are much fewer
then many people lead others to believe) will now be farmed by 1 person
with two accounts, one being the approriate level the other being a non
approriate level. And now since that camp is being held by 2 different
characters, that person can be their twice as long to obtain that Lore item
for both character to sell.

That being said, I cannot understand this concept of "inappropriately high
level farmers". What makes it inappropriate? Who defines what is
inappropriate? Why is it inappropriate? I mean, did the person KS from
someone else? If so, it is wrong. If not, they were lucky enough to get to
the camp first. Some people have the desire and joy for getting XP in
everthing they do. More power to them. Yet should be say that any person
not getting XP in what they do is doing something "inappropriate"? If so,
then are trade skills "inappropriate" task since they do not give us XP?

The problem here is not one of farming or camping or high levels doing it.
It is one of envy. A person has an area because they got there first.
Someone else envies this fact. A person is able to do something by
themselves because of their level. Someone else envies this fact. A person
is able to kill a mob. Someone else envies this fact. A person gets a rare
desired item. Someone else envies this fact. It is right to limit those
that we envy?

But it does not limite farming to groups that can gain experience. It
limits farming to the one who has two accounts or has a guild with a lot of
twinks. A person with a character that is of appropriate level to a mob
swill not need a 6 man group to kill a mob if he has one 50+ druid or
cleric or shaman to protect him, will he? The power of heals and damage
shields and buffs and slows to a low level player is invaluable in the
encounter making it just as "trivial" eventhough they gain XP. And they
will do so without a group, as well.

Yes, I agree. I am not blind. :) If there is value to an item, there will
always be someone that will farm that item.

Except there will still not be 6 appropriate level getting the item. It
will be 1 appropriate level and 1 high level protector. What is the
difference between that and the high level getting it themselves?
Especially, since the same physical person will most likely own both
characters.

This belief that the TCC will make un-popular zones more popular to low
levels is a falicy. There is nothing in the code that grants that. It does
not increase the drops. It does not make the zone closer to city zone
areas. It does not make the zone less of a train death trap. It does not
make it easy to get a pick-up group. All of those are the reasons that a
zone is un-popular. It will not increase the amount of XP a person will get
in a zone.  And unless those things are changed, that zone will still be
un-popular. If you pick any less used zone in the game and asked random
characters of that level "Why do you not go to that zone to hunt?" I do not
think you will find many that will say "Because it is so crowded with high
level farmers that I cannot hunt in it." And unless a lot of people are
making that statement, TCC will never increase the un-popular zone's
popularity.

With the low level farmed items, this is not true. The items price does not
drop as much as with other things. The reason for this is that there is
generally few to nothing better then that item. The GBS is 9k on my
servers. It has been 9K on may server for years now. It drops from a level
16 NPC. Yet, the SSoY that drops from a level 49 NPC sells for 1k if you
are lucky. Why? Because there are many things better then the SSoY now. The
GBS is still one of the better items in the game for its slot. An upgrade
path on items is what often cause the price to decrease. Not necessarily
just time. The majority of the items that we are talking about that high
level farmers seek all have a decent stable high level price value to them.
It is been stable for a long time. TCC will just increase the price of the
item to a new stable value due to fewer suppliers. Add an item that is
better, and you will soon see that the high level farmers will no longer
farm that item. Why farm the SSoY for 1k when you can get a Lamitation just
as easy and sell it for 10k? Why farm the PGT for 100pp when you can get
the Lamitation just as easy and sell it for 10k?

Actually, I believe it does apply to EQ. It is just that we so often over
look the fact because we think it is "just a game" and standard economic
theory would not apply. But standard economic theory is not really about
real life money. It is more about the thinking processes and
rationalizations and decision making processes that humans do every day
with trying to make a trade. This can and does play in EverQuest just as
much as it plays in the stock market.
