Well you're partly right :)

For pure damage calculation, your dmg/delay formula is a little
simplistic.  It doesn't quite work in the main hand after 27th, since
you're not including the main-hand damage bonus: (lvl - 25) / 3.

E.g. my level 37 warrior has a bonus of 4.  Magic number of a weapon is
(2 * dmg) + 1, so a Lammy would have a MN of 2 * 9 + 1 + 4 = 23 at
level 37.  Plugging those numbers in:

Lammy (9/19):  MN=23, 23/19 = 1.21
Wurmy (25/40): MN=54, 54/40 = 1.35
Centi (14/27): MN=29, 29/27 = 1.07

So, the Wurmslayer easily wins out at that level.

[ Note: With 2-hand weapons, the weapon delay also increases the damage
  bonus.  I can't remember if that applies to 1-handers. ]

But try again at level 55 (10 bonus):

Lammy (9/19):  MN=29, 29/19 = 1.52
Wurmy (25/40): MN=60, 60/40 = 1.50
Centi (14/27): MN=35, 35/27 = 1.29

The Lammy just about beats the Wurmy at that level (and for a warrior
who wants to taunt is a considerably better choice).  The Centi LS is
not a good main hand weapon at either level, but is excellent in the
off hand (where all you're interested in is the ratio).

Agreed.  Ultimately the best weapon for you depends on both your level
and your class.

I still haven't seen any hard data to support/refute the effect the
stamina bar has on attacks.  The best I can offer is that my troll
warrior (STA around 125) sees no ill effects from an empty STA bar, but
I admit that's not very scientific :)
