    It may well be bullshit, but it isn't against the rules (but see below).
Just like the person parked in a corner getting swimming up, it isn't
against the rules to do something while AFK as long as you aren't using a
device or software to modify the EQ client.

    People who run macros are using software or devices to modify the EQ
client, according to the rulings we've seen. The programmable joystick, for
example. These AFK campers aren't doing that.

    Gah, you really want Verant to put in code that dumps players? Do you
trust them to do it right? My take on it is this:

    If someone is doing this someplace where nobody ever sees them, and is
willing to take the risks (being trained, the pet losing a fight, going LD)
that go with the rewards (gaining XP at half normal rate while somewhere
else), I'm fine with that. It's a feature of pet classes as far as I'm
concerned, and if you can pull it off good for you. If someone is doing this
where someone else is inconvenienced by it, then use the rules to move 'em
out. For example:

(1) Call a GM, and explain that the pet caster in question is refusing to
share whatever spawn the pet is killing. The GM will come, verify that the
mage is in fact not sharing (he's AFK, he can't), and nail them for that
after telling both sides to share. I imagine the GM would be personally as
angry at AFK playing as you are, and would be more than willing to use the
rules to bust this person for it.
(2) Stand beside the spawn point, with the GM present, after complaining the
mage is KSing you. Don't try too hard during the fight. :-)
(3) Charge zone disruption by monopolizing a spawn. More tenuous, but again,
the GM is likely to want to help you bounce this guy.

    Such a specific ruling is not required. The definition of training, item
nine in the PNP:

Training is defined as pulling an NPC along behind you and attempting to get
it to attack another player who does not desire that engagement.

    Since anything that attacks a pet will go after the pet's owner next, by
bringing mobs to the pet you are, by definition, training the controller of
the pet.
