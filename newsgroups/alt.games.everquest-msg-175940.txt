Because every race does not get every class. Some get few classes, its
the way it works. Shamans and warriors have nothing to do with 
monks and beastlords, you may as well ask why ogres and trolls
don't get rogues and monks; They just don't.

Worse than that, no new race has ever been enchanter/druid or mage.
Perhaps there is another one I missed. As you said, monks got iksars.
Shamans and warriors got Iksars, vah shir and now Frogloks. Necros got
Iksar as did Shadowknight. Paladin got froglok. Druids never got any
of them, though they could have made froglok or Vah shir fit being a
druid.

It just comes down to every race not getting every class. It is
actually more surprising and great that frogloks get a cleric. That
makes them self sufficient since all you need is a cleric and any
melee classes. Both vah shir and iksar were a bit odd, stuck way out
in the boonies with no one to experience resurrect until other race
clerics get out that way.
