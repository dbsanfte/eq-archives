    I've been fighting yellows lately and don't recall more than a handful
of stuns every hour or so.

    Cool... Have you had a look at veksar gear? :) I love that place!

    I don't like to "defend" my opinions. If I say something here, I'm
putting it up for peer review, but aside from clarifying what I've already
said or when I think of something new, I don't really like the idea of
making a point then *defending* it. What do I care if I'm wrong? When
someone corrects me, I learn something. Arguments where one person makes a
solid "This is what I reckon and anything else is wrong" point and then
someone else opposes them rarely result in anything other than a lengthy
thread that's *Barely* worth reading, and often descends into name calling,
I've noticed.

Cheers,
James
