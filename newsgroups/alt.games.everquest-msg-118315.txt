Cultural armor is so freaking rare for some races. I have spent six
months trying to connect with the one person on my server (that I know
of) to get dark elf cultural armor made and we still haven't connected
for the second to last step (enchanting the blocks). Kinda annoying.
Not the smith's fault, just annoying that so few can spare the
ginormous amount of time it takes to get to that level of expertise.

And that's tier'dal cultural armor, one of the most common!

I think if Verant could go back in time three years ago and do it all
again, they would have made cultural armor easier to make, and
increased the rarity or difficulty of class quest armor, to get the
opposite frequency as exists now.
