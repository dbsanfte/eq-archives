But I got the impression that sometimes you need to find info in a
hurry?

True enough.  Just trying to reduce the likelihood of making a

I think I probably will be, as it sounds right up my street.  My main
concern is that I don't normally get along with first party GUIs

suffer from it IRL.  Descent was always fine, though.
