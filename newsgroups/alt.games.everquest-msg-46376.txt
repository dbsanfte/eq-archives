NOTE I HAVE NO EVIDENCE FOR THE FOLLOWING I COULD BE WRONG

Sorry about shouting.

Also reading between the lines I'm guessing that the xp bonus/penalty
will work something like this :

	OG	NG	DG	ON	NN	DN	OE	NE	DE
OG	++	+	-	+	==	-	NO	NO	NO
NG	+	++	+	=	==	=	NO	NO	NO
DG	-	+	++	-	==	+	NO	NO	NO
ON	+	==	-	++	==	-	+	==	-
NN	==	==	==	==	==	==	==	==	==
DN	-	==	+	-	==	++	-	==	+
OE	NO	NO	NO	+	==	-	++	+	-
NE	NO	NO	NO	=	==	=	+	++	+
DE	NO	NO	NO	-	==	+	-	+	++


Where 
++ is "lots" of bonus
+  is a little bonus
== is no effect
-  is a penalty ("up to the grouping bouns")
NO is they can't group silly.

Anyone with numbers who can post them would be a hero.

Cheers,

Jim
