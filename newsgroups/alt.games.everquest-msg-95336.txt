I've got an opposite story. I have two chars that I play regularly -
my "main" currently 35th Warrior and my 19th Cleric. (I've also got an
8th Enchanter, but I just can't get into playing him.)

When the Cleric was 10th level, I ran into a 60th Cleric in Kaladim.
He asked if I had another char and was twinked. I said that I had a
30th (at the time) Warrior, but he could not afford to twink me. He
tells me to meet at the bank and he would give me something. He tried
to give me an arm slot armour (forgot what it was, but it was AC25, I
believe - far better than my Warrior had at the time - or currently,
for that matter). After I refused that - I told him that it was just
too good - he tried to give me some gauntlets - again, forgot exactly
which ones they were, but had never seen or heard of anything so good.
I refused that and he was starting to get a little annoyed - and I
must admit, it was tough for me to turn down these gifts. Finnaly, I
said he could give me the worst item he had - it was a Centi
Warhammer. He wanted to give me cash as well. I didn't want to be
rude, so accepted 150 plat.

Since then, my Warrior has "twinked" the Cleric with a full set of
Banded Armour - all I could afford. Eventually, if I can afford it,
the Cleric will receive a full set of FS Plate.

I'm quite proud of the fact that my main, anyways, is twink free. The
only gift he has ever accepted was a reinfored leather mask at 5th
level - I was King of EC with mask on! At 35, he wears a few pieces of
banded, a few pieces of FS plate and a couple pieces of Crafted. I
made the banded and FS, and quested for the Crafted. He wields a BABS
- I pried it from the cold dead fingers of a goblin I killed.

Actually, I purchased the Crafted Greeves. Some guy walked up to me
and asked if I had any money. Figuring him for a begger, I answered
"some". He said he wanted to sell me some Crafted Greeves. I said I
only had 15pp on me (which was true). He said, give me the 15pp and my
FS plate greeves. WooHoo! Talk about a bargain...
