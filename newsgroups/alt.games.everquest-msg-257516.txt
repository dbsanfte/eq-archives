I was the tank in an LDON the other day as a 34 paladin.  I did not
have Temp nor did I want to get it and several people in the group
gave me serious grief for not doing so.  Thankfully there was one
other person in the group who understood my position so I didn't think
I was the only sane person in an insane world.
But here's my position on it:

Before Temp was available tanks did fine.  They killed things and kept
on going.

After Temp was available alot of tanks did fine without it.  They
killed things and kept on going.

All the while maintaining aggro and giving everyone else a chance to
play their role.

My thinking on uber buffs is that you lose tactical knowledge of the
class you are playing as well as the strategies and tactics of the
group makeup you are in.  A tank plays differently when there is a
cleric than when there is not, at least in my experience..  They still
tank but tactics are altered.

I even had one guy give me grief because it was taking longer to level
his character and it was costing him money.  Huh?!  I stated that they
must just all be power levellers and not players, 2 said yes.  I
couldn't friggin believe it.  I asked what they did before Temp, not
play?  I guess the answer to that is yes also.

Anyway, point of post is in subject.  The rest is rambling I guess.
