I've fought dragons with "gimp chains."  A heal is a heal.  :)

/rude Verant's level restriction on Nagafen

When you get up to the point of actually needing a CH rotation, though, it
would be very tough to organize a single burst from all the second-rate
healers to take the place of a CH.  On the other hand, miscellaneous smaller
heals from the ranks goes a long way toward keeping the MA up through a
cleric fizzle or lag spike.  Not that it wouldn't be possible, but it would
be quite difficult to coordinate.
