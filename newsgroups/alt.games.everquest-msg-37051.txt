It would likely be about as populated as Test server...

Here's how you find clarity/SOW: "/ooc Could I get a <clarity/SOW>?
Will come to you". People who send me direct tells, especially while
I'm busy, asking for SOW get ignored. All being non-anon will allow is
for you to see who is capable, it won't increase your chances of
getting the service.
