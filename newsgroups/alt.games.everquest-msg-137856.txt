I have tried just about everything I could think of to make skins
work.  I copied default directory under UIfiles to a new folder and
renamed that folder. I then unzipped files from a 'complete' skin
download into that folder, and logged into EQ and used skin command
with no parameter and it showed the default directory and the new one
I created.  I used /loadskin myfolder, it looked like it did something
but don't see the new skin ingame.

I read somewhere that you had to camp out then and log back to see
change, well that didn't work either.  I didn't  try zoning after that
tho, wonder if that will work??

I am also wondering if you have to create a twin directory under skins
directory to with same name as your new UIfiles directory??


Anyone have any ideas as to what I am doing wrong, or at least a link
to a sight that has a complete "how to" on to load skins??
