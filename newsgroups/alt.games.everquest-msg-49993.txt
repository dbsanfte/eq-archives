Flaming Bizbee... NOT a good idea. =)
The posts are just kidding around, relax Ill 28.  And its true that on FV a
server that's new and people are particularly poor (its tough startin out on
this server), you still get people begging.  "Can you spare a couple pp
d3wd", is somewhat comical when there are over 200 ppl in Gfay and 98% of
them dont have more then 10pp to their name.
