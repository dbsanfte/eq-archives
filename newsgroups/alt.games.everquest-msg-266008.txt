Exactly my point. Real Xp is not damage alone. It's taking damage. It's 
finding appropriate content I can take that's a challenge. It's getting 
the pull right. It's debuffing the target. It's the downtime I take as a 
tank. Now it may be that CoH is so f'n perfect that none of that is an 
issue at all; Debuffs are universal or non existang, content is easy to 
find, no pulling is needed, there is no downtime. In that case I agree. 
If none of that is true, the person's leeching off my work. I concider 
it stealing part of my work just like some asshole leapfrogging me is 
stealling my work (I work my way to a boss mob, and some asshole jumps 
the boss while I'm still preparing after clearing all the chuff on the way.)
