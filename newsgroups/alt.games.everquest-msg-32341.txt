Horses for courses - for example, I usually fear kite with my druid when
fighting things like griffons, since I'm not really up to quad kiting
them (!), and I really don't like meleeing a sushi-chef with a beak.

And it gives me some breathing room - fear *and* snare have to both
break at the same time for it to all go pear-shaped.
