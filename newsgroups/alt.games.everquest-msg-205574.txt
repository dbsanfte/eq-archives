For me, a constant stream of mobs is more challenging, because with long
fights, once the initial 'tash / slow / debuff / cheal' has gone off, it's
just whack / nuke / heal until it dies.  Nothing else to do.

If the mob dies quickly and another arrives, then there's another flurry of
activity, if another mob is arriving before that one's quite dead because
we're chain pulling, then it's far more exciting for me (and I appreciate,
everyone plays the game differently and enjoys a different aspect).

But generally, the amount of XP per mob you get at high levels (assuming at
least DB) doesn't vary that much.  If we take PoI, the difference in XP for
a group between killing a blue and a white is very little, but the
difference in landing spells on the white can be huge if you're just at the
cusp, so the fight can take much longer.  I'd rather have killed three DB's
in the time it took to take out the white, and end up with more xp.

So yes, it's xp per mob * kills per hour, but at the level I'm at, the
highest value for that is DB mobs, not white/yellow/red (in a general
sense, using a typical tank/cheal/slow group).
