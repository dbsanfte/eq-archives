 I am running Windows ME (Installed on the system at purchase, not by
choice) on a Celeron 700 with 512ram and an onboard 32mb video card.
 Game runs fine with all new models turned on, with the exception of they
are all naked. They show the newbie robes when I start new chars, but later
on, they start to undress again.
 Any help would be appreciated.
