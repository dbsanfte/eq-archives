So then play one. Called equality. If you want the good, you take the bad
too. Theres no bad in having more levels than someone else tho. Never a
situation where that is a liability.

Why slog through the worst xp table in the history of gaming (no
exaggeration, I've seen first hand how getting 1 level from 40-50 in DAoC
takes more killing than going from 55-60 in EQ)  just so I can be equal to
other people?
