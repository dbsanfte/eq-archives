Halfling cultural tailoring uses imbued plains pebbles.
The Karana flavor of human cultural smithing does as well.
Not sure if there are other uses.  At any rate, I've never
had impued plains pebbles sit for long on a bazaar mule.

But Lance was wrong about Cabbages, Cabbages come from NK.  You
forage Tea Leaves in EK.
