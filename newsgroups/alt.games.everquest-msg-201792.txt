Theoretically either never or 255 depending on who you believe.
Realistically there is a curve of limiting returns.

I once saw a graph that some one had compiled from thousands of trad skills 
tests that showed that the difference between say 100 and 150 was large, 
but the difference between 200 and 250 was minimal.

The general wisdom is get it as high as you can, but don't bust your self 
up if you are somewhere near 200.

Those graphs may still be on the net somewhere, check eqtraders.com they 
may have a link.
