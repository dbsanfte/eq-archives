Well, the current method for encouraging groups is to give them
an exp bonus, so 6 people get exp per kill as if there were
only 5 of them dividing things up.  Further, there's a bonus
for killing harder stuff.

Now, say you have a solo artist and a group of six.  Say
further that the solo artist is capable of killing 1/6ths the mobs
per hour that the group is capable of.  If he joins up,
you kill 7/6ths the mbbs, and only divide by 6, so to speak,
so he makes an extra 1/6th per kill, without diluting the
exp that the original group is getting.

Further, if the addition of that 7th or 8th person means you
can kill higher level mobs than just the 6 person group,
then you may see even bigger exp bonuses to the couple
extra people, and even a noticable bonus to the people
in the original group.

This assumes, of course, that a seven man group still
gets the full exp bonus accorded a 6 man group.  If
its somehow hosed down to the solo'er rate, no
group bonus at all.  This would mean the 6 people
would take a 20% exp hit to take that 7th person.

Since they aren't saying, expect some gnashing of
teeth and some misunderstanding till we get it all figured
out and work out where the advantages and disadvantages
lie.
