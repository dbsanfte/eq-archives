I have a 53 Pally alt too,must say he takes a lot of time from
playing my main,cause he is fun.

I exclusively play Ldon with him,cause I enjoy pulling,so
my spellset is:

1) Greater Healing
2) Group Healing
3) Root or Yaulp (depends on group)
4) Pacify
5 to 8 - variuos stuns,depends if I have Kei or other mana
regeneration buff,and on some stun spells the casting time
is a little high,they are only good when I am not maintank
(rarely).
For buffing I switch spells in slot 8.

I dont have Ethereal Cleansing ,cause I  am lazy.  :)
Gheal with IH2 and MP2 does the job too.
I  am often surprised,when people say they dont want 
to move without Cleric.Druid and Shaman,supported
by a Pally healing,is good enough,especially at that 
level when Pallies are still able to single pull,no need
for complete heal.
