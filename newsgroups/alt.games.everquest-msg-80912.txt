Why such a response to George mentioning that his character's sense of
moral standards comes  into play?  Obviously you have your own standards
and are happy with them, that is good.  His standards have nothing to do
with your char.  All that matters is that you are happy with how you
play and he is happy with how he plays.  Remember, Bob also said "I
could go east, I could go west, it was all up to me to decide" <G>.
