For the longest time, up until they made rangers archer gods, my rogue had
better archery skill than almost any ranger he met.

Did he have any explanation as to *why* he was impersonating a rogue?

A simple way to tell rogues from rouges in high-hazard areas - can you see
them?  A rogue, by habit, will be hidden.  A rouge (or your warrior) won't
be.  In a rogue's skill list, Hide = Evade, and Evade = aggro reduction.

I've been doing interesting things recently with my rogue.  Helping
high-level groups get into CoM for cleric epic bits.  Unfortunately, the two
groups I went in with were so high level that I didn't get any XP.  Oh,
well.  It was an interesting experience.

(Extra interesting was that my 194 skill wasn't high enough for one of the
doors they needed on the second trip.  I wound up practicing on the spot to
get to 200 with blue to red critters all around, and a couple of times an
active battle going on.)
