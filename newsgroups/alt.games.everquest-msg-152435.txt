}For how long?  Getting the ES means you've cleared the bottlenecks in the
}quest.  Frankly, the stats on this thing aren't that good.  I could have
}walked around wielding the Ancient Longsword, too, but it would have been
}silly.

Depends on what you consider a bottleneck, and what else you have 
available to compare it with.  

}I could maybe see Druids using the ES back when your chances of getting
}Faydedar were lower than your chances of being struck by lightning twice, but
}now?

Sure, triggering Faydedar is no problem... but the odds of actually 
convincing her guild to take him out, and them being able to?  I'd bet on 
the lightning.  First there's Ulump to contend with, too.
