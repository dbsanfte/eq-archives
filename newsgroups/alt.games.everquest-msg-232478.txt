Well, a graphics card upgrade for more memory would be the most 
expensive and most fun fix to the problem, but assuming for the moment 
that's not an option for you just now, you might try the following for 
free:

- Turn off the 3D sky;
- move the clip plane nearer to you;
- use fewer new models;
- turn off animated socials;
- turn off dynamic lighting;
- reduce or turn off spell effects.

These adjustments might make it playable for you once again. I had the 
same issues for a time, until I had saved enough for a new graphics card 
with lots of memory on board. I like being able to have all the bells 
and whistles turned on and still have the game flow as smoothly as a 
movie, but it took some creative budgeting to save.

Hope this helps.
