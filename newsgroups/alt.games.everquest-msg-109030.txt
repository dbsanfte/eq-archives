What point? His point looked to me to be that the game is evil because
we go around killing creatures that look different and are a little
slow for now reason. BULLSHIT! Let's see... Orcs? The Crushbone attack
Felwith and Kelethin and take slaves from the elves, dwarves, and
gnomes. The Deathfist terrorize the Commonlands. Gnolls? They attack
Surefall Glade and Qeynos. Frost Giants? Attack Coldain Dwarves and
the dragons.

It's a war. We're roleplaying sides in a war. We aren't going out and
attacking hapless little deformed retards, we're going out and
combating aggressive monsters.

Now, the point you seem to be making in the rest of your post (Which I
did trim) is that the game should have a non hack-n-slash method of
advancement. I agree with said point, but the fact that the game is
hack-n-slash doesn't make it anything near "evil", which is what the
original poster was ranting about.
