I came back because DAOC is EQ lite.  It DOES do some things better than EQ,
I won't argue that, though I may argue on what's "better." :)

- If you liked chat, DAOC doesn't have it.
- If you liked to group, DAOC doesn't support it.  Well, actually, they have
a nice system in place but it's used about as often as people in EQ doing a
"/who all lfg" when looking for folks to join their group.
- If you want a reason to level in DAOC there is only one, and if you don't
like the answer, why bother leveling?  That answer being, of course, to
become better at RvR

Ok, I AM going to debate one.  "No need for corpse recovery."  Well,
no...you don't have to go get your loot, but if you only want to take a
DOUBLE xp loss (compared to EQ) rather than a triple loss, you'd better go
find your stone and pray (and yes, I know, I'm exaggerating the xp loss, but
it IS depressingly more than EQs).

I was kinda looking forward to RvR, but "kinda looking forward" isn't really
a bigassed endorsement for the game.  Meanwhile in EQ I found LOTS of
reasons to level.
