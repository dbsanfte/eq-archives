Take a look at your Rune line.  It uses the same reagents as the cleric's
Symbol line.  Until you get to your 30s (I think...jasper) it's not too
expensive but when you get to I think 44 and start using a peridot (10.5p
each for enchanters...about 12p for ugly dwarves) it starts adding up
quickly.

If your group cleric is casting Symbol on the group at ANY level, if he's
not a twink and doesn't care about the 2g per cast you really should make
sure he gets reimbursed BEFORE splitting the loot (include the cleric in his
portion of PROFIT as well).
