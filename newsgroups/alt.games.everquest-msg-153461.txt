I only bot my cleric when I'm "solo" - I use
a KVM switch, and I find that I just can't
be effective doing both my mage and the cleric.

OTOH - when it's just me and the bot cleric things
are awesome.  You can heal a pet all day long without
getting aggroed - my cleric usually sits right at
the feet of the mob I'm fighting and stands only to
heal/buff/rod.
