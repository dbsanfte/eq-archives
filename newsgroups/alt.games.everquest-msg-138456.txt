I don't agree with those verdicts at all. The only time I could see a 
problem is when a person got a disease prior to the warnings of health 
risks, but that was what, decades ago? I realize they're addictive but 
people know they're dangerous, an addiction only goes so far. If a person 
really wanted to quit they would, whether it required these new patches 
and gums, support groups, etc. Where there's a will there's a way.
