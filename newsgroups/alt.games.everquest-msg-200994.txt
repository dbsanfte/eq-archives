That doesn't mean that the game should be altered to accommodate them.

I am not touting "my way" here. I am touting the general philosophy that 
stopping and smelling the roses is something we should do. Otherwise the 
whole game is devalued, whether you choose to recognize this fact or not.

Trouble is, the game cannot be altered to accommodate everyone. My 
feeling is that if you max out your 65 warrior, for example, it would be 
perfectly understandable that you might want to play a cleric now. 
However, it should require just as much effort to do either. You can't 
offer shortcuts only to those who *deserve* them or can justify it. 
Besides, why should you be allowed to shotgun to the top with another 
character merely because you have done it once already? It should be 
harder than that. It should be an accomplishment, a show of more then 
just an abundance of free time.
