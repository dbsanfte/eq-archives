Al Qeada DID NOT control Afghanistan. Who told you that? Your

Indeed. And no, the German people weren't misled into anything. Some
supported Hitler because of the hideous social situation in Germany,
which ultimately started WW2 (modern paralels anyone?), others were
forced to join the Nazi's or lose everything (for example, my Great
Grandfather), while those who wanted nothing to do with it fled the
country (for example, my Grandmother and the rest of her family).

And as for justifying bombing Germany - they started it. Sounds
childish, but it's true.
