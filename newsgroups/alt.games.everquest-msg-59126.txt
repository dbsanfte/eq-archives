    I tested this one recently. My warrior killed live and dead frogs,
always /conning live frogs after each live kill. I went to glares from
dubious sometime during the killing of two live frogs. I then killed two
dead frogs, and was still glares to live frogs. So I conclude the faction
hits are actually greater than the faction plusses.

    On Jakugg's "killing the Lord" idea: my rogue killed him and stayed
Dubious. Dubious is a big faction range, but that means that the faction
bonus is very unlikely to save a dedicated troll frog-killer. There's a
reason you green guys start out KOS to the frogloks (hints include murals in
Upper and the prisoners in Grobb). Even if you could do it, live frog
faction is very tedious to repair, requiring a TON of killing undead frogs.
Get used to the harassment from greens, or do what I did with my warrior and
go someplace else. 8)
