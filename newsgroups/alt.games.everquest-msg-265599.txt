   You know much more about the end game than I ever did, so I will take
your word on this.  I thought that perhaps some might have a hard time
scraping together enough bodies to do the raids at all, but I admit I never
really knew much about raiding in general, and might be way off base here.

   True enough.  I remember reading quite a few crowing posts about DAoC
and SWG, and even some games that weren't close to being released, being EQ
killers, and I have to admit they did annoy me.  It could very well be that
EQII won't be all that and a bag of chips, and it will end up being as big
a disappointment as I've heard SWG were to many people.  I personally have
my doubts about it, and don't know if I will play or not.

   Ok, here I have an issue.  I'm a doomer?  I've predicted two things in
this thread.  One that there will be a population drop due to lack of new
players to make up for attrition losses from EQLive (reasoning, perhaps
incorrectly, that newcomers will gravitate to the newer game).  And two
that the first server merge will take place a year and seven months from
the (again, probably incorrect) projected release day of EQII.  Does
thinking that there will be a loss of population over time make me a
doomer?  Well, in your mind, it could very well be so.  However, I've also
predicted, in this thread I believe, that EQLive will be celebrating a 10th
anniversary, and probably more beyond that.  I that SOE will respond to a
population drop, and adjust accordingly.  I don't think these adjustments
will mean the doom of EQlive, though.

   Looking at the big picture, do I think EQLive will be around forever? 
No, I don't.  I don't think that any servers at all will be up for this
game fifty years from now.  I might be wrong about that, but I think that
newer games, either with or without "Everquest" in the title will eclipse
EQL.  So in this sense, yes, I am a doomer.

  So Ben, what about you?  Do you think EQL will run 50 years from now?  Do
you think that server populations will be pretty much the same, or with
just a slight drop, a year and half from now?  I'm not trying to be a
smart-ass, just curious at to how you think the population numbers will
evolve or hold steady.
