My main is a beastlord, so I'm curious what life is like for another
major pet class.  How high of a priority would you recommend a pet
focus item for a necromancer?  As a mainly bazaar-geared level 68 BST,
Binky still deals a sizable fraction of my total DPS and can briefly
offtank, if needed.  Gaining a pet focus (Minion of Eternity) from
having none was a noticeable boost.  I would put a pet focus as easily
competitive with any of my other offensive foci (e.g. Improved
Damage).  Is a necromancer's pet significant as DPS/offtank or merely
a DoT with a graphic/speedbump?  Was the rogue pet (backstabbing while
you kite; you'd delete his taunt skill, if you could) the best thing
to ever happen to necros, or do you typically lay down the pain from
afar while Jabober tanks?

I would tend to agree that Summoning Efficiency/Haste are not worth
seeking.  I never re-summon unless something goes horribly wrong and
Binky has to take one for the team.  I can't imagine having to absorb
the mana cost of chain summoning (and buffing!) pets.  Are these foci
something that just sounded good to SOE over too much late night
Mountain Dew, or are there situations where they actually matter?
