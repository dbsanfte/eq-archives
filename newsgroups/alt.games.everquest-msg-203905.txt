Ive never posted here before but lurked tons. As i have a ton of
experience killing these with a druid i'll give some info. Common
spell they cast is boil blood, a 500 point dot. If you can snare and
be running as soon as snare hits you'll usually be out of range of
there dispell or dot before they get it off. If you have access to the
Ceramic Sword of War (extended range 4) you'll find your spells can be
cast outside the range they have. I usually only got into range before
getting this item to root them the first time then dotted them to
death. Creeping crud, Drones of doom, drifting death and winged death
3 times would always kill a chroma before root wore off. Regular
chroma's are anywhere in zone. Mature Chroma's are usually hanging out
near the Overthere tunnel access. No more xp as far as i can see
killing them and nearly double the hitpoints. Uncommonly for me
anyways they've poisoned (maybe twice in a hundred or so chroma's). 
They regularly drop 5pp or so, wings sold for a couple pp each. Very
rarely drop essence of sunlight. On Saryryn server ive sold it for
500pp each and never managed to keep it on my mule for more then an
hour at that price. Others have been selling it for 750 to 1k.
I always pulled along the south wall near loc n3500, n1750. Where the
lava river comes out of the wall. There's a hill there and if you
pulled behind the hill along the wall nothing will wander there or
agro.Iive left my druid sitting there for extended periods without
worrying. I hope thats enought info for your wizzie to make a choice
on hunting them. Good luck.
