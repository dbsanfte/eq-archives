  The way it works is like this: unless the pet outdamages the
individual or the entire group, the pet takes no experience (or a
negligible amount).  If the pet outdamages the individual and the
entire group, it takes 50% of the total damage of the kill (that is,
if somehow the pet does more damage than you and everyone else in the
group, and the kill is worth 1000 experience, the pet gets 500 and the
other 500 is distributed normally between the group).

  It's usually a pretty pathetic group that can't outdamage a single
pet, but I guess if a pet is a real monster, I suppose it can happen.
It's a bit easier for a pet to outdamage a soloer, but a careful
soloer can avoid it most of the time.
