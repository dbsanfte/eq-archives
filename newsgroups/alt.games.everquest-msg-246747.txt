Is it really that big a deal? I use firefox. I don't use IE for 
anything. It's not on but one of my three machines (the other two are 
running lite variants of MS OS's). I went to register for EQ2, noticed 
the requirement for IE, switched computers, ran it, went to the site, 
let it do whatever it does and turned the whole thing off.

Now, even on that computer I don't run IE unless I have to. I've grown 
way too used to firefox to ever switch back to IE now, but so what? So 
there's an activex thingee I downloaded and ran one time. What's it 
going to do now? Assume it's a boogieman out to send my bank passwords 
and credit card numbers and blood type to the men in black. When's it 
going to do it? How's it going to do it? Seriously.

I'm asking. I ran the applet a few days ago. Is it sitting there now 
waiting to rip my lungs out through my ass in my sleep or what? Does it 
run every time I turn on the computer? Does it dash off to find Drew 
Barrymore and phone home or does it just sit there taking up HD space?

I guess there's several answers, 1) What IS it doing, and 2) What are 
the Art Bellers saying it could possibly do if the chip implanted in my 
neck by the illuminated seers of mistmoore were firewired to it?

PS: I switched away from OE and IE due to security concerns. I run 
firewalls due to security concerns. I manage all connections in and out 
of my computer. If I don't know what initiated it then it's not doing 
either. I'm not paranoid of anything specific. I just hate anti-virus 
software so I won't run it. Since I'm running naked I try and make sure 
if I get bitten I don't share it.
