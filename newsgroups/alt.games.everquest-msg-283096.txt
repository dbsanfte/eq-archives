Long ago, I went through some of this pain with my troll beastlord.  At
the time, I was interested in the progressive beastlord claw quest.
Remember that the iksar have several different factions!

Killing sarnaks or goblins slowly raises your faction with the warriors
(I forget the faction names now).  One approach is just to grind
through legions of green mobs.  You might also try the newbie area in
LOIO - very fast spawns of level 1-4 goblins and sarnaks.  If you're
higher level, you might alleviate the boredom by hunting something
level-appropriate in Nurga or Droga.  I also spent a lot of time in the
goblin caves in Frontier Mountains, which got me both deathsteel
smithing materials (for a cheap, albeit low-droprate, skillup path) and
skins/salts for Sarnak faction (I never did finish getting that Spirit
Wracked Cord...).  As a necromancer, you might consider getting the
meat-to-bonechips AA to speed things along.

The explorer quest is not only a large faction boost with the warriors,
but it also bumps up nearly every other iksar faction as well.  Sadly,
the necromancer faction is not among them (nor the bonechip quest
either, as I recall).  The only things you can kill for iksar necro
faction are the pariahs and similar mobs.  There are some buildings in
southwestern Warslik's Woods with several spawns of pariahs, all around
level 15 or so.  I never bothered to raise the necro faction myself, so
I can't tell you much more.  

Hope that helps!
