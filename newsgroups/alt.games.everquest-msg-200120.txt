Lol i doubt it.  If I want to move him, I need to buy LoY for my third
account (rogue / bazaar trader).

I didn't even buy LoY for my shaman (my second main).. so I probably have to
slum it in tier 1-2 zones

Hmm rhags... sigh we've had this rot in the past..  If it were rhag1 I'd
happily go solo him.. but I don't think rhag2 will be the same.  Wtb a
second melee to take rampages

I'd rather be permanently engaged than pet canni'ing to fm between mobs,
even if it were just pet melee, DS, and continous right click nukes.  I
think that would be faster
