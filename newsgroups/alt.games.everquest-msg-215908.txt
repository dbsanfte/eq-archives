I am starting to wonder about a possible bug in LDoN groups. Where casting
is concerned...here is why...

I was in a group in MM Catacombs, we were doing an assignation adventure and
the Boss spawned and we were real close to the room. We made our way there
and got our full mana and engaged the BOSS...the MA fell then I started to
take the brunt of the dmg and the cleric was doing a fine job we had the
boss down to 25 percent and 20 mins left on the timer. All the sudden I get
a "Please Wait Loading..." message. WE spawned at the ZONE IN.
Our group consisted of...
60 Cleric
55 Ranger
57 SK
58 BST
57 BRD
60 WIZ

So I started to question in group chat the Wizzy (a guild member of mine and
I have been on at least 8 adventures with him) about WHY HE EVAC'D us? He
stated he did not that his escape staff was in his bag and he had no
transport spells loaded. I believed him. Looking at my logs I can not for
the life of me figure out who cast it but it stated that we all cast a
portal.

In guild chat there was a discussion about this and we found that a couple
of other guildies have had similar "WILD CASTING" experiences.

Now I am starting to wonder.
