Ok so I tried several more times last night and I found out what is
wrong.

I used my regular invis and ran through several points across the
opening. Cost me 4 deaths but I am low level no big deal and this
was pissing me off, there had to be a way through. I finally made
my way through. Once I was through I turned around and conned
the guards. One sees through my invis and the other one doesn't! Doh!

The guard on the right as you face out from the arch is guard
Heridion and he was "ready to attack" to me and the guard
on the left was Membuknar and he conned "indifferent." So
what you need is regular invis and you need to go slightly left
of center as you enter. The major bitch about this is that you cannot
con the guards from the entrance, but a trick to use is to go to
3rd person view and you CAN target the guards from that view. I
felt so stupid, this not dawning on me until after I had made it through.
Well one more trick for my book, good learning experience. =)

Now I just hope those 2 guards don't switch places on me. =)
(wouldn't that be just like Verant to do that?)

BTW The several times I did aggro those guards I ran and
strafe-ran to try and out run them but they caught me every time.
I was not overloaded or anything.
