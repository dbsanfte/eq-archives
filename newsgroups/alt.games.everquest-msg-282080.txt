Hi all. I'm thinking about trying EQ and I had two questions:

1. Am I able to play the game with just the main game itself, or does 
playing it now require that I have all the expansions as well? What 
would happen if I played with just the main game?

2. Is there any reason to think that EQ3 might be coming out soon?

Thanks!
John
