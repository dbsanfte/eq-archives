When in Rome, or so the saying goes.  The first night I was pulling my hair 
out, trying to find what I needed to kill only to have someone always get 
there a second faster because I was trying to be polite.  After a while, I 
realized I was going to get nowhere that way so I went in search of new 
hunting grounds.

With the exception of a few specific quests (such as mines) I eventually 
found that there are other locations where the same newbie critters will 
spawn away from the crowds.  Find one of those spots, and you can hunt 
relatively unhindered.
