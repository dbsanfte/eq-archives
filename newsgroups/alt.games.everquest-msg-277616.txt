Joining a guild would be great.  I think it is really important to be honest
with a guild about your son's age.
There are plenty around but you need to make sure that you join one that is
family orientated.

As someone else mentioned Teamspeak is a great tool for playing, I wish we
had used it in EQ1 :)

With the changes that have been made to tradeskills much of the
interdependency has been reduced so it really depends on what you want from
tradeskilling.
For example I have a scribe that needs quills, paper, inks and tempers.
Whilst these are not standard combines for a scribe, I can make them at a
slightly higher fuel cost and not have to go looking for anyone else to make
them for me.
It has made the process of tradeskilling alot more fun for me.

Good luck with your choices!
