A "Geerlok smithing device" is a tinkering item, made by the Evil Gnomes.
Very nice to use.  Although, you cannot use that while using a smithing
hammer, I believe, which is going to hurt.

I bought one for my DE Wizard.  Got her from 1~115 in less than a day, while
in Shadow Haven.

Her STR is 73, Int is 201, CHA (when using Opal steins) is 120.

Big thing: Make sure you have HIGH or GOOD Charisma.

My Shadow Knight (1st chr) smithed mastery also, but her CHA sucked (under
70) and her INT was 118.  Took her a LOT more than a single day to get to
mastery (several months for she gave up at a certain point, ran out of
money).

Yep, spent a LOT of money, but now I know what to do and such, thus the
wizard had a easier time.

Now, that I have a High Elf Paladin... Guess what she's going to do...

(Gotta love trying to push forward for Cultural Smithing)
