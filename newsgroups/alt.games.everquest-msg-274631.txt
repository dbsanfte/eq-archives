Perhaps you enjoyed the storyline but you weren't there aparently to
get hit for 5k damage in 1/1000th of a second without any chance to
react because you never even saw the mobs because the lag was so bad.

Which means you also werent there to try to recover your body and die
several times more because of it. Only to discover that (now several
of) your body(s) was/were stuck in one of SOE's wonderful graphic
errors and couldnt be recovered at all. Paid a Necro to summon it,
only to discover that "you have no bodies in this zone" because it had
crashed.

Or loose all your equipment when the bad programming repeatedly
crashed the DL and FV zones. (I didnt but several people were
complaining to the GM's in the system chat)

Yes, it was a wonderful storyline.

I want a refund.
