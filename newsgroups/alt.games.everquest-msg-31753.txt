I bet they used to go for a lot more. Saw someone buy a froggy robe
for 5 k in a message board auction today...

I already have a set of gnomeskin as my sunday outfit, or for whenever
I wanna disguise as a rogue :) (Haven't bothered with sleeves)
The stats are pretty much just slightly better than splitpaw, which
means the gloves are nice for druids statwise (Same wis, some other
stats are better). The gloves also look really nice with my chipped
bone bracer. As of yet, I wear gnomeskin boots on a permanent basis.
