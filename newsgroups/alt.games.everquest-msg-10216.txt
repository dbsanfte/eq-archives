This is a good strategy in Rathe Mountains if you're killing HGs.
Instead of exchanging gold for pp from another player at a big loss (and
maybe not even destroying silver if you're cheap), go to the gnome gem
vendor by the inn and buy gems like opals and emeralds to soak up the
extra coins. With my CHA, I only lose a couple pp on each gem. If even
your pp gets too much, buy some rubies. You do lose 10 to 15% on the
transaction, but it's more convenient than a long run to the bank and
back. Druids and wizards can ignore this idea of course.
