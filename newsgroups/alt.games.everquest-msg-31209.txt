*lurker comes out from hiding*

Greetings fellow EQ'ers.  Sorry about the Word Association thread.  I hope
you killfiled it already, but didn't killfile me.

Anyhow, now for may question/rant.  What does the "Avatar of Terror" or
"Summoning Terror" quest involve?  No... I don't want to know about the
items and such.  I want to know about the amount of time one must put into
the quest, difficulty of obtaining the items, and the like.

Why do I ask this question, a person might ask.  A few days ago, I started
an Erudite Shadow Knight (something different and challenging).  Anyhow, I
started him up on the Luclin server.  Yesterday (or a couple days ago
depending upon your time zone) someone decided to start the Summoning Terror
quest, and not finish it.  So... the Avatar of Terror shouted this message
around every ten seconds.  He was doing this for at least an entire day
before he was handled.  Now, who would be such a sadist to do such a thing?
It became a great nuisance for everyone in the zone (I migrated to the
Warrens, avoiding Paineel as much as possible).

There is my little speech.  I just had to get that off my chest, or
something.  Take care, and happy hunting.
