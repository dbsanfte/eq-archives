2 things to try/keep in mind:
Try 1: make sure the needles are not "no drop", they could have 
changed that.

Try 2: If it's truly a Fier'dal needle, try having a High Elf 
sell it to the vendor, it might be a bug that it won't let you 
sell it (though I'm not sure how you made it if you're not a High 
Elf and it's a High Elf cultural needle). 

Keep in Mind 1: It seems (to me on Lanys) that SoE is actually 
preventing you from selling certain high end *desirable* items. 
When I first started, about 3 years ago, I had fun finding out 
how much a vendor would pay me for a weapon I paid 10k for (4p 
comes to mind but I don't remember the item). It seems like they 
are not buying certain items at all now, probably too many people 
hitting the "sell" button and having to pay 50k for their 10k 
item to buy it back. The needles might be on that list.

Keep in Mind 2: Some tradeskill items were being sold to vendors 
for more than the cost of the comonents (probably jewelry as I 
can remember getting more back for the enchanted jewelry than I 
paid for the components). It could be the price for this was 
"dropped" all the way to zero.

If the "selling back to the vendor with a true High Elf" doesn't 
work, might try /bugging it. I saw in EQTraders that the name 
shouldn't be Fier'dal (wood elf) but Koada'dal (high elf) and 
this name difference might make the difference in selling it.

Just my 2cp.
I also did this at 5am and am not really awake.
Any and all *constructive* criticism is welcome.
Hope it helps
