Cant say I will miss the boats. Though I still get a little nostalgic
remembering the /shout Boat! that rang out through BB every 20min or
so.

As far as CR's go, I played DaoC for a few months, and I have to say,
the edge is outa the game when there is no CR. Some of my most
memorable times in EQ were on CR's. Some of my worst times too.

Bottom line, I think if there is no RISK associated, then there is no
fun.

That stinking vile filthy feeling you had when you died on autorun in
OOT somehow definitely SHOULDNT be in place. Bugs and wierd deaths
suck, unfortunately the same digusting vile bottom feeders that
exploit trade bugs etc will exploit guides. So naturally the guides
won't help with wierd or unusual deaths.

The buzz you get after a horribly close fight at King in Seb wouldnt
be there if you just could just release (DAOC term) and log for the
night if things went wrong. Those horrific CR's late into the night
build friendships, camaraderie, and character, bonds which last longer
than the game, these are the thngs that MAKE the game fun to play.

Many many many things have improved in EQ. It is a far cry from the
old days of EVERY mob in LGuk being killed dead the INSTANT it
spawned. Nowadays its possible to level your entire career and never
set foot in a dungeon. There is something for everyone in EQ these
days.

Even spots for the weak and heartless. Lets keep CR's, pleasure and
pain I say.

Anyway, FLAME ON boys.
