Better yet, unless this is where you are, go near the entrance to Najena.
Good "safer" place to heal/med and critters are just as plentiful.  This way
if things go ugly you don't have to run down that seemingly long road to the
Nektulos zone, instead your just a hop away from a zone.  Stay right near
the zone-line though, unless they've fixed the higher level skellies that
spawned near the exit.  Bunches of experience, and a pretty good place to
hang out.

Happy Hunting
