I gave up and a ranger took over the camp; i just gated back and she was
still there, waiting for a spawn. Has anyone seen this mob since OOW was
released? I remember when the monk epic was broken and GM's kept telling
people it wasn't; some mob in SK wouldn't spawn, can't recall details, but i
think they denied it was broken for a couple of months.
