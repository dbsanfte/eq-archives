I know the expansion was effective last week, but I only found the time to
play last night.  I ran around and got my adventurer stone, then hooked up
with a group and headed off the the dungeon in Oasis.  The entire group
managed to zone in, all that is but me.  I stood on top of the black zone in
until the door closed on my head.  I clicked, I jumped, I petitioned but no
luck--they were in and I was out.

The group leader said that it was the second time that had happened to a
group he was in that day.  I sat by the zone in (hoping to get a response
from my petition).  Another group tried to zone in -- and they were unable
to zone in.

Has any one else had this happen?
