EQ can be very addictive, and certainly constitutes a risk for people 
who have addictive personalities. However, as far as addictive 
"substances" go, EQ is one of the most benign. It won't kill you, unless 
you forget to eat or drink during a botched raid with a long CR. At 12.
95 a month, it won't bankrupt you, unless you hit playerauctions.com -- 
and that's not being addicted, that's being an idiot. You may alienate 
your friends and family, but you'll have a social life, of sorts.

The one really disturbing possibility is that of neglecting young 
children because of EQ; I've heard that it's happened, but I don't know 
to which extent the story (which I cannot be arsed to google for right 
now) fits the facts.

The bottom line... as with any other addictive substance, approach with 
caution.
