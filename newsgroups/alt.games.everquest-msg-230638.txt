I thought it was generally accepted knowledge that charisma is only a
saving throw for Enchanters?  Hell I don't know.  I hear one thing and
then the other.

Get a rat and head further down the wall to where you can pull the
goos.  You can travel relatively safely along the wall until you get
to the spiders.  When you see a large striped rock, stop following the
wall.  Either stop before the spiders and hunt around that area, or go
past and pull stuff in the relatively safe area behind CCY (Center
Court Yard.)  To get to CCY, stay to the right of the striped rocks
until you see a huge white wall made of vertabrae.  The vertabrae wall
will open up to a courtyard in front of the castle.  That is CCY.  In
there are level 57 lightcrawlers and underbulks that you wont want to
fuck with.  But just before you go through in to the courtyard,
anywhere along that vertabrae wall is fairly safe.  The flies are all
bunched together and are usualy only soloed by bards (hard to single
them I would bet) so you may want to avoid them.

Also note that there are 3 or more types of rats.  Just get the
diseased ones, or which ever is the more common one.  The feeble rats
and other rats are higher level and more importantly, have high magic
resists.  (At least they resisted fear and snare on me a lot).

Stay away from ths spiders.  Many see invis, harmtouch, snare, etc. 
Also some of those flies or larvae are SKs IIRC.  They are a little
further in and have a different name (dont recall) but could easily be
confused with the others.
