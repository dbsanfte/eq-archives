IMO----Old Sebilis ( Juggs/Trak area)
              The Hole  (Master Yael/Nort area)
              Velks (Castle area)
              Umbral Planes (any of those caves where the
              loot is sooooo good)
              Howling Stones/Charasis(any
              damn where in the zone)


These are just a few I have run into in my time playing....probably are more
I have blocked from my memory, as being too horrific to remember.
