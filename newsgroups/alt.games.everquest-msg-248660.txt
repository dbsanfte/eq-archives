They do have some beggars that randomly ask for a few coppers now and 
then.  The one in butcherblock is the best, since if you give him a 
copper he won't go away. :)  There are also some in Freeport.  So the 
ability is there...

More things like the Horasug deal in Thurgadin, perhaps, but with more 
interaction. (Follow Horasug around as he runs from pub to pub.  It's an 
amusing way to kill 15 minutes if you don't mind the lack of a real 
punchline.)
