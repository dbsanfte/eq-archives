I used surname as simply an example of something you might be looking
forward to.  *I* was certainly looking forward to my first one...picked it
with serious care & thought.  My most recent character had a really stupid
surname (only stupid to me, not others...it just didn't "sound" right to me)
picked because I didn't think I'd be playing him much.  A GM was nice enough
to erase it for me.

The character is a gnome wizard.  I sent the following petition and waited 4
hours for it to be answered before logging off (which was fine, I wasn't
paying much attention to that computer anyway) only to log on the next day
and see it gone:

/petition  Hi!  I'd like to get my surname removed, please!  I got a divorce
and she took half of everything...in fact, I used to be a human!

(yeah, lied about the reason...when I petitioned shortly after the
name-change policy went into affect and told the truth with as much humor as
this petition the guide told me they couldn't change/remove it...a guide
friend suggested I tell them that it was a guild surname or a married name
and I wouldn't have a problem)
