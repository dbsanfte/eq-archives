I'd only worry about the quality of card you're getting for $150.  It's not
just about the chipset all the time.  If possible, (if I were you and had
money) buy a better card for a little more.  Name brand.  Diamond or  PNY,
maybe?  I heard do not buy Creative Labs.

I've got a 64MB GF2 MX400 PNY card and I run everything in EQ smoothly,
except Luclin cities.  The patches supposedly helped that.  I haven't been
there since though.
