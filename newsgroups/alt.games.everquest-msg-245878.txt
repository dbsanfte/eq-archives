Let me just say that I 100% agree with the above statement.  What I didn't
mention was that his whole purpose in zoning into TimeA was to train us
while we were preparing to raid; he was quite disappointed to discover the
mobs in TimeA are non-KOS.

I posted this link not to celebrate his accomplishments but to warn people
that these kind of hacks are out there, and could potentially receive
wide-spread distribution.  I certainly hope not, but anything is possible.
This guy was out to explore the limits of what he could accomplish with this
tool so it was almost inevitable that he would get caught, but in the hands
of someone who's a bit more discrete... the mind boggles.  Think how trivial
plat farming would be, for instance.
