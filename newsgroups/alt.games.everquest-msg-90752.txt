Are you a member of the alt.games.everquest police? Who authorized you to
determine what does and does not get posted here?

You must be new to the newsgroup, because the patch message is posted here
in the NG after every patch. Sometimes twice, depending on who's paying
attention.

And what if Crash is a member of the VI team? Does that give him/her
permission to post the patch message? Or would that make it "OK" in your
eyes to post the message?

Here's a hint to people who think the world revolves around them ... no one
cares about your problems, we are too busy worrying about our own problems.
