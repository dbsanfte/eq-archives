>And you keep telling yourself that VI can detect showeq.

Packet sniffing is completely passive. There is no way VI could
directly detect ShowEQ.

On the other hand, if you are using ShowEQ to track mobs, spawn times,
and other specific events, it would be very easy for VI to plant false
information that only a ShowEQ user would detect. If such a player
responds to the data they are caught red handed.

For example let's say VI puts in a second Ancient Cyclops in South Ro
that is invisible to players and not displayed on Track. Any players
caught beelining to the fake ACs location could be ID'd as possible
ShowEQ users. Having the fake AC run in circles and watching such a
player foolishly chase it would be the final nail in their coffin.

Cheers
