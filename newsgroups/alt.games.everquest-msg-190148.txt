I used to stay away from bank/malachite merchants for very long
periods of time in my 50's  IE Several play sessions of several
hours each would go by before I'd make a bank run again.  I suppose
if I soloed more in those levels, then pet canni would have suited
me.

Until I make 64 and suspend minion, I don't anticipate using it
much though - summoning a pet, 2 swords of walnan, a belt and
a muzzle each time makes it too unwieldy.

Someone on the magicians tower who's 65 uses Son of the Rathe,
QS 3, SCM 3, Ele Pact and Suspend Minion to go from 1/4 mana
to full in absurdly short times.  I think they also have the
gloves of dark summoning from Vex Thal, so the pet comes with
4500+ hp, so each summon/reclaim cycle nets almost 200 mana in less
than 6 seconds :)
