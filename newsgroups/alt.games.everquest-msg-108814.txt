True to a certain extent. When dealing with propaganda, I think its
called "spin" now, you are completely correct. However there are
absolutes that when violated, evil is done no matter what "spin" we
may place on them. Murder is murder, there is a clear line between it
and self defense or at least there used to be in the days before we
became "enlightened". 

There is no doubt we have lost more than we have gained after all....
