"if" they don't listen to the problem then yes, I completely agree, it's 
time to use the /guildremove button.  It's not like there's a lack of 
guilds out there ;p

I don't consider him a prima donna for not wanting to port.  It was just 
that it seemed like you were suggesting *starting* with the "make them 
stop asking me for ports or I quit" line rather than "guys, we have a 
problem, I'm not having fun here..." or something, and seeing what the 
guild leaders are willing to do about it.

I've got no argument with that.  I have a few guildie friends who've 
sent me tells while playing alts, but I notice that very few other 
guildies are aware of them.  Sometimes I get asked "what's so-and-so's 
alt name?"  I truthfully answer "Sorry, can't remember." ;)

*nod* I rarely ask for a port.  Even though I loathe running from, say, 
EC to Qeynos Hills *g* I just don't feel it's worth my time /ooc'ing for 
an hour rather than just hoofing it.  Although I sure as heck stop and 
offer plat to any sowers I see along my way *g*

Yeah he is, and he needs to do something about it.  But if you were his 
guild leader and didn't notice this was going on (you can say they 
*should*, which might be true, but nobody's perfect, and sometimes you 
forget what the other class's problems are in the middle of trying to 
keep a raid organized), and all of a sudden you got a tell saying "make 
them stop asking for ports or I'm quitting your guild"... y'see what I'm 
saying?  Just like asking for a port/sow/whatever, a request always goes 
over better than a demand.  And hopefully his guild leader will be 
mature enough to see the problem as soon as it is pointed out, and deal 
with it.  Mine did.

*nod* Good way to find that out, for sure.  Personally, as a melee 
class, I have an easier time of it, since people don't really have 
anything to beg me for.  OTOH, I've had one guy rant at me when 'my' 
group didn't invite him, and another guy approach me several times 
telling me to get him 'in' with my group, to leave my group and take him 
places, etc, etc, etc.  Those people have a special place on my "you are 
too stupid for words" list. :)

Ryou
(of course, I don't ignore them, because that would take away from the 
fun of watching the /ooc's I see them sending)
