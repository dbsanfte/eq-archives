I have to agree with the others, talking to an officer in his guild would
have been a good start.

As far as unwritten rules...it is not polite to move in on someone's camp.
It doesn't sound like you did this, as you say that you had been there for
three hours without seeing anyone.  If there is someone at a camp, it is
generally acceptable to ask if they mind sharing (if the pops are fairly
quick), or ask them to inform you when they leave so you can take over said
camp.

As far as written rules...SOE does not enforce camps.  In extreme cases of
both parties complaining to a GM, I have heard of and seen a GM make people
share a camp, but I've not seen them say "Jon_Doe" was here first, you have
to leave.

KSing however, is NOT allowed and is against the rules.  I've never really
had a problem with someone KSing, but I leave my log on all the time just in
case.  If someone start KSing you, or constantly training you on purpose,
then go to that portion of the log and /report them.  A GM will step in and
take action for that.

Hope this helps.  I'm by no means an expert, but these have just been my
experiences.
