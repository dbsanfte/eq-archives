If I had bought the ability, I've been in a few positions where my death 
was assured, but using act of valor may have given a cleric fighting 
chance. It probably should be a complete heal type heal. I haven't 
bought it because I see more immediate benefit to some of the GoD aa's 
I'm grinding.

As far as classes that pull too much agro on raids go, in my experience, 
shadowknights are up there in the top 5. I see them summoned and 
flattened more than wizards. On our raids Shadowknights don't tank. This 
makes them no better than casters, rogues etc who get flattened (and 
they last about as long).

I'll pay the INT / WIS comment, but make a note that these are aa's that 
any rational sk or paladin would be getting as about their eight 
hundredth aa's, I'm only on six hundred or so. I suppose if you made 
some really bad ALL/ALL gear choices, and put stats in creation into 
something other than WIS you could end up with an INT > WIS situation 
where it would be useful to pump INT for tradeskills, but that probably 
falls into the category of imagined, and would take REAL effort anyway. 
That said my int and wis are pretty close.
