From the shadows, the mysterious Aruvqan <mtraber251@earthlink.net>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

So you are comparing yourself to a two year old.

Well glad to get that out of the way....

You are so full of shit. LOL

If you're going to make stuff up try to make it believable.

Face it, you made some bullshit claims and you got called on it and
now you have egg all over your face.

P.S. standard usenet etiquette has always been bottomposting. The only
places that don't consider that the default norm are those where very
short replies (one line) are the standard. Any place that has context
issues prefers bottomposting.
