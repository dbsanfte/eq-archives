Even that may not work, because many compilers place
timestamps in the executable indicating when the various
.OBJ files were compiled (or the EXE was linked).  Furthermore,
memory space set aside for runtime initialization is 
often left uninitialized in the EXE file, and contains 
random junk that varies from compile to compile.
