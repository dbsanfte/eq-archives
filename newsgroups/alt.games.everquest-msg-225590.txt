It used to be ONLY for:
1. Entering or leaving a family guild where all guildies shared a 
surname (Gargles Travelling Circus all had the surname 
Gargleflargenblaster or something like it)

2. Marriage.

3. Divorce.

As a guide, when someone petitioned me for a surname change, I'd tell 
them the reasons surname changes were allowed. I'd then ask them if they 
were getting a divorce. They usually said yes, even if they were trying 
some other song and dance routine about why it must be changed.

This is probably a large part of why the rule was changed to no longer 
caring for a reason to change your surname for you.

Remember the bad old days when you had to petition to share a surname?
