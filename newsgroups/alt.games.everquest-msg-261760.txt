WHich is why I'm really starting to prefer to lean towards the decay 
flag being switched on when the item is handed off. Basically it lasts 
forever until you give it away... and then it starts deteriorating.

The lower level the character, the faster it rots. (through use, not 
just by having it in the bank)

I think that system goes a long way to rewarding the player who 'goes 
through the hoops to get really great stuff' vs the stuff 'i found it on 
sale in the bazaar, i don't know what it drops off or even what zone... 
and it doesn't matter cuz im only level 10 and probably couldn't go 
there anyways.'
