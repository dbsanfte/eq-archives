Greetings,

My main is a 57 PAL.  I am the original owner of the account.

My RL friend (65 PAL) is leaving the game.  He has offered his 57 ENC and 65 CLR to me at
no cost.  Both characters are tagged in one of the top-5 guilds on our server.  The
characters are on separate accounts.  My friend is not the original owner of either
account; they have been handed down through his guild for years.  I'm pretty sure that he
has never spoken with the original owner, if he even knows the player's name.

(I'm not planning on using either character as anything more than support for my main.
IE, the CLR would provide V and rezzes (maybe toss MGB HoV in PoK for giggles), and the
ENC would be a 2-box slower.  At any rate, I would never take either character, solo or
2-boxed, into a multi-player situation until I'm very confident that I can play the
class.)

In a perfect world, I would leave my PAL on his original account, and move the ENC and CLR
onto a single, separate account.  This would be the most efficient, in terms of billing.
The ENC and CLR would retain their guild tags.

However, if I correctly understand SOE's Character Transfer guidelines, I'll run into some
nasty thorns.  According to (https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_moves):

1> The ENC and CLR must remain on their respective accounts because I am not the original
owner of those accounts.
2>> My friend cannot move the ENC and CLR to a single account, because he is not the owner
of either account.
3> If #1 & 2  weren't concerns, SOE removes tags as part of the transfer.
4> If #1, #2 & #3 weren't concerns, both accounts must have access to the same expansions.
as the source account.

Can someone assist me with developing the best course of action?

Best regards,

Tim ==
