  Found something else that might help but once again it's a pain when done.
I read a post where someone was having same problems with eqclient crash and
they deleted there whole Map folder and let eq rebuild it and fixed there
problem. Well I hated to take away all mine sinse mine was just doing it in
PoK so I just deleted the ones just for that zone and repatched. I zoned
several times and logged characters on that was stuck there and not one
crash. Just something else for you to try if still no luck.
