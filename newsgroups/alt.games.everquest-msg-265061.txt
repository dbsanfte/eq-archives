Yeah, I guess so.  I've got those two icons on my secondary bar, so the 
ruler at the bottom is hidden by Alt-8.  Looked identical with that hiding 
it.

I took quite a bit of time to rearrange each of the icons in groups 
depending upon what crafting category they belonged too.  General icons for 
daydreaming, etc, then alchemy, arcana, etc.  Makes it much easier to hunt 
for the appropriate icons when you only have to worry about a smaller group 
depending upon what your crafting.

Of course, it kind of threw me at first that crafting paper at the arcana 
station required woodworking icons.  That almost killed me.
