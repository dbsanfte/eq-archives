I was told that Hasten(if that is his name) wears the boots, and you
just need to kill him to get them. Its not a drop every time item, but
that you can kill him and they will drop. 

Can anyone confirm or deny this fact? 
and if so, why don't more people just camp him instead of the AC? 
faction?  


Thanks
