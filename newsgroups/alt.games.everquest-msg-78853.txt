I have found a great duet to be a Mage and Druid..

Druid tracks and pulls with snare. Announcing INCOMING! Mage DS's the pet.
Mage sends in his little buddy to take the pain.
Druid Dots the Mob or if an animal Fears, then DoTs, then meds
Mage nukes  At this point the Druid cna begin hunting the next victim
depending on the mana situation
If needed Pet gets a heal or gets resast if more mana efficient.
***You gain party Experence***
who ever is closest loots or more than likely the druid loots on the way
back with a new snared mob

additional benefits.
SoW
STR + HP buffs for the pet
Ports making it easy to switch to a different location if your favorite one
is camped
Mage nukes are almost as good as a Wizards.
both Mage and Druid Rock against summoned creatures  (wasps in BW or
anybodys pets)
EVAC.
no weight summoined packs for carting off FS weapons to the merchants.

Example....

Spright (DRUID) and Vamuklaa (MAGE) on nameless camping Gornit in OOT.
Pet is buffed and DS'd
send in pet and cast malaise (mage) plus snare (druid)
pet taunts after the second "Taunting attacker Master" message  mage nukes
Druid nukes... mage nukes
if pet in danger of death, either chain cast a new pet or both casters heal
Loot the body.  Mage puts all the FS in summoned packs.

<<<<later>>>>
packs are full of stuff and both are encumbered with coin  mostly copper
give all the coin and summoned *full* packs to the druid.   druid gates to
Misty
sells the loot converts the coin to PP and having bound nearby gates back
and gives the mage the split of the winnings
in the amount of time the druid is gone it is possible that gornit has
spawned if the mage cant take gornit solo waits on the druid

the advantage of this camp method is gornit can drop up to 40pp per kill the
money is nice and with the druid banking there no chance of losing the camp
to others while you gate to a bank in FP and ride the boat back...

Just my 2 CP
