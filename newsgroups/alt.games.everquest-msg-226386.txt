What the fuck this has to do with the price of tea in China, I can't
fathom...

*shrug* If you're not interested in the product, don't fucking buy it.
Wasting your time whining about what they're giving away free with it
is less than pathetic. If you want in the beta, apply for it when it
opens up. Nothing at all is changed about your chances of getting in
compared to if they didn't have this offer.

Yeah, it is. You're pitching a temper-tantrum as if this promo is
somehow screwing you out of something you need. You'd think they just
mugged you in a dark alley with the way you're pissing and moaning
about what amounts to nothing. If you don't take up the offer they're
making, then you're totally and completely unaffected by it. The only
reason to be "outraged" is if you're just looking for something to be
pissed off about. Personal problems at home and looking for an excuse
to blow off steam, maybe?
