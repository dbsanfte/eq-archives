No, I actually meant while I was tanking, although it was a pretty
flip remark ;) They die *very* fast so its generally only for a few
seconds, my main weapon is a 2h'er and procs both a lifetap + an
aggro getting rune both of which are handy for keeping those doing
damage doing damage and whittling the mob down and when I see enrage
message I tap one of the nukes memmed. I miss most of rage in casting
+ I have maxed dex and am a bit proc happy.

To tell the truth though, I got so so used to turning off attack for
rage in other circumstances it'd never really occured to me that 
riposte wasnt just ranger-paste-making but was 100% shielding too. I
should pay more attention ;) LDoN is the first extended tanking I've
done around ragey mobs, I guess. Otherwise I've been behind them 
wailing away, shooting from a distance or soloing in which case the
rage is hideous anyway. (Hi Gantru Dralkenr Summony thing, do you have
a bracelet for me today?)

So, yeah, I guess It wasnt the most useful of contributions
to a.g.e in the world ;)

If I'm entirely honest I guess I dont turn off enrage on normal mode
because I cant be bothered and its rarely worth it. I'd not recommend
the same approach on 'hard' though ;)
