I was escorting a DE SK around to get his spells (he was kos in DE form,
wtf?)

In wolf as a wood elf druid normally - Indifferent to SK guild, bouncers and
vendors, THREATENING to shaman and warrior guild.

Also, there's a couple vendors that are indiff to all out in Feerott,
Innkeep Gub and Murga I think are their names.  I was normally in wolf to
avoid guards but I happened to forget about it and to my surprise I could
still use them.

Of course annoyingly enough I now have to do the same thing in Freeport, I
just went KoS to the militia over the weekend, I'm at the high end of
threatening now. (I was bored waiting for the boat and was going to keep
that girl on the end of the dock rooted til the boat got there, but a
wandering guard didn't like that and I had to kill them both.)
