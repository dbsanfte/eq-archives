I ran into a similar situation when Luclin first patched.  I got on the boat
at Butcherblock docks heading for Freeport, I zoned into Ocean of Tears no
problem but it took a long time.  The trouble started when I went to zone
from OOT into Freeport, I would always go LD.  When I returned, I was still
on the boat but now headed for Butcherblock.  When I went to Zone from OOT
into BB, it took so long to zone that this is what I saw:
You have just entered Butcherblock
Loading Please wait....
You have just entered Ocean of Tears...
This cycle was continued for three hours a day for three days, I tried
everything, I turned off all the options, I defragged and rebooted stuff,
finally I was able to jump into the water from the boat when we hit BB and
swim for about an hour til I found shore.
