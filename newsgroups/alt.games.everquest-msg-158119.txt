It redefines the viewport.

You can do it without messing with
any XML stuff - but it sure helps
to make the other portions of the
ui fit into the blank spots you've
created.

Presonally I switched back to
1024x768 - /viewport 0 0 1024 615

Then I fit most everything in the
black band at the bottom - with
the chat window rising up into
the viewable area a bit.

I did some real basic XML mods -
it's easy (and sorta fun) if you
have 2 comps - just share the
eq folder from one comp, and
edit the xml from other - then
/loadskin
