This isn't a Everquest question but I'm going to be getting a new 
computer soon and plan on getting back into mmorpg's. But I actually 
like to role play. I'm not a player that plays just to level up. I was 
just wondering if there are any real role players on any of the 
mmorpg's? I don't remember ever meeting any in Everquest or Asherons 
Call. Well I did meet a few on AC but I lost track of them. The only 
mmorpg that really had a good amount of role players was Ultima Online 
but I'm looking for something more current. So now I notived there are 
alot more mmorpg's and more are too come. Is there hope for me or should 
I just stick with the book old paper and pencil with my buds for role 
playing?
