He is right, there is a gap in the door, you'll see it to the right.
Swim into it, wiggle around (up, down, left, right while swimming
forward)  press duck off and on every now and then, all at the same
time (BTW have a water breathing skill cast on you). It will be tough
the first time, but if you watch others and over time, it will become
very easy to just swim in. My characters and guildmates go there all
the time without a key.
