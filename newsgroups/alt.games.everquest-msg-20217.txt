I was doing the /auction gig tonight, trying to clear up some space in
my inventory. One of the items I was selling was a Bloodforge Hammer.

You auction, 'Bloodforge Hammer, 2HB, 13/50, SvMag10, 10 plat'

Now, I know the /auction line is showing up correctly, because a
friend in the zone verified it for me. Read it back to me over the
phone.

A Barbarian warrior sends me a tell "What are stats on hammer?", to
which I reply "Check the auction for stats". I then run the auction
again, so that he can see it easily.

He then sends another tell "ok interested in buying BH, how much?"

Oy.

I answer "For you, just 25 plat."

He answered "20pp an you got a deal."

Good lord, he's talked me down to merely TWICE my asking price. What a
master haggler this rube turns out to be! Grudgingly, I accepted his
offer.

Add yet another "dumb barbarian" anecdote to the pile.
