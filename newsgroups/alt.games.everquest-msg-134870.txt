Referring to each other by job may not be as personal
and chummy as all that, but it does help cement the
working relationship.  I'd far rather people react initially
to me as their friendly neighborhood cleric, than by
my remarkably uninformative name.  Heck, I could be
a paladin or warrior easily enough, if you observe
a dwarf in plate, or almost anything if you are going just
by the names in your group bar.

Time enough to get more personal after everyone is
very clear who is saving who's bacon, and who is
taking the damage, and who is doing the damage,
and who is making everyting we can't handle all
at once wait politely in line.
