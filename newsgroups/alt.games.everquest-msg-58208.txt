I did not in any way attempt to justify any evil here.  I, personally, abhor
the violence that is commited in the name of religion, nationality, or just
about any other cause, no matter who is committing said violence.

You have no idea what I have and have not read, you are making assumptions
here.  I am not parrotting the "mawkish sentiments" that I hear.  You have
absolutely zero knowledge of my background.  You have made it quite clear
what your viewpoint on this subject is, and appear to be quite closeminded
about it, albeit, I will admit, quite eloquent.

That being said, I have had enough of this OT cross posted thread.
