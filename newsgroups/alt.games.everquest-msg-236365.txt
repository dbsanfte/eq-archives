Thanks guys for your replies. I posted this over on TNZ and got some 
very good info there too about the fun of playing a Dark Elf. If I don't 
do the Dark Elf I might think about either a High Elf or Dwarf but 
someone pointed out to me using Magelo how little it matters over time 
for stats like STA, the points you have starting out.
