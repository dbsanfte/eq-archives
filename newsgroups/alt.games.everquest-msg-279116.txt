Good luck tracking that info down, since some of those servers no longer
exist anymore.

Innoruuk, Veeshan, Sol Ro, Tunare, Rallos Zek were some...  and I'm not even
sure about those.  It's difficult to remember which "original" servers were
actually the 2nd-wave servers (like Rodcet Nife, which opened like 2 weeks
after the game started).
