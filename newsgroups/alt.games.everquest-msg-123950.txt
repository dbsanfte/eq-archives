Bin Laden is not pissed over the presence of infidels in Saudi Arabia.  Oh,
to be sure, he'd probably like them gone, but that's an issue between Bin
Laden and his government, not between him and the United States.  Remember,
we're over there at the request of the Saudi crown.  Why is that?  Because
Saudi Arabia can't effectively defend itself against it's neighbors.  If Bin
Laden was legitimately upset about our presence, he would be working with
the government of what used to be his country to change that.

The real issue with Bin Laden, as it is with many of the Islamic extremists,
is Isreal.  They want the jews out of the Middle East, plain and simple.  We
are Isreal's biggest military supporter, so we are lumped in with them.  The
attack on the WTC was not only an attack on the U.S., but on Isreal, as
well.  Anyone notice how quick the various islamic groups were to try to pin
the attack on Isreal (and yet claim it as a huge victory in their own
media).  Didn't get much air time, since it was overshadowed by the event
itself, and the response of Pres. Bush.

That is closer to their European policy.  It seems some think Clinton is
still in office, so the U.S. can be lead around by influencing Europe.
Immigration in european countries, notably Holland and France has changed
the politics in those nations.  Anti-semitism is a large force there.

I think that we agree that Bin Laden brought down all of his efforts on
himself when he set his terrorists to work.  Pres. Bush was already talking
about a Palestinian state (a bad idea, IMHO) before the attack.  All he's
done is rally his opposition against him.  It's like trading down to the end
game when you're still down a Queen.
