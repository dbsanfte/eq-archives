Yes, in general, I agree with what you've said here.

Absolutely correct.

Yup. That will cause the least friction.

There's wrong, and then there's wrong. Yes, you would be within your
rights, but this is one of those situational things. For example, if
the camp in question is large enough to adequately support two groups,
then it's reasonable to force a share. If the group already there is a
bunch of snotty brats, then again I'd consider it fair to make them
share the camp - they'd obviously be in need of a lesson on the
concept of sharing.

In general, though, rather than force someone to share, I'd just head
for another zone. The world of Norrath really is more than big enough
to support everyone, and you do get a reputation based on your
actions. Something to consider.

Sounds to me like you're pretty well grounded in reality, and I
predict you'll find your playing experiences to be very enjoyable
overall.
