Yeah. That's about it. We went in today to camp two things for the necro
quest armor. I used an invis potion to get part way down. Then just
slugged the rest of the way to the shaman's room where the globe of
shadows drops. Had to stop about four times, for groups of two to ten
frogs. Not that big of a deal. I think I'll just keep whacking them and
eating froglegs.
