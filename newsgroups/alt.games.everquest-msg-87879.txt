Yeah.  And some of the really uber guilds (of which I am definately
not a member of) have stringent requirements on AC/HPS/Resists
and some such, too.  Why? Because if you go with them to raid
ToVN and your resists aren't at certain levels, you'll cost your raid
time and efficiency to keep you alive.  I've seen iksar monks wearing
a fungi and with chloro that had such high fire resists they didn't
take but a point or two of damage in lava per tick...THAT'S the guy
you want when Faydedar starts tossing his AoE around....

Yeah.  And the " n e 1 got rouge gear for mah twinkee?" questions
can make you want to strangle a new person.

To death.
