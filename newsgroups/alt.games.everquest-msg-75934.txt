I kind of think of Spaniards as "French without an attitude".

The problem is that most people in the US think of anyone with a Hispanic
surname as coming from Latin America.  They tend to forget that there are
people in Europe with Hispanic surnames.  Let us just say that in America,
the lowest common denominator tends to win (this is the country where 75% of
high school students in Dallas, Tx, could not correctly name the country
that borders the USA to the south).
