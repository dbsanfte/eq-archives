Oh I have a lot of stones, believe me. EQ has done so much for the
whining casuals that has turned out to be complete crap for the game.
Paludal and Dawnshroud's exp rate? Bone to casuals. Nexus? Poor
casuals didn't like having to beg for ports. Shadowhaven? Poor casuals
didn't like having to do lots of work for faction. Bazaar? Poor
casuals never had time to sell their items. PoK? The casual's
dreamworld, where faction, travel times, and everything else that
might have taken more than thirty seconds of their precious time was
thrown out. Tier 2/3 exp gain levels? Gotta get those casuals up in
level, takes em too long anywhere else. Advance to L65? Gives casuals
a global power boost to do content they couldn't do before. LDoN? Nice
compact zones the casuals no longer have to move two feet to get to,
along with equipment upgrades the casuals can easily farm.

So don't give me crap about having to "reach" for stones. SOE has made
change after change that has benefitted the whining casuals. Do they
appreciate it? Of course not. Moremoremore....

The whiney casual powergamer is the worst blight in mmorpgdom. Worse
than dewds, cheaters, plat sellers, all of them.
