Ya what he said. No matter whether you PP or no someone thinks you get magic
Hill giant plat from platless mobs. Once you do start practising PP I am
sure you will grin at the number of coppers and silvers you pick. At higher
skill and when you can take a hit or 2 from hill giants those can be fun for
PPing.

One tip to
A) make group mates aware how much PP does and
B) get skill up
is to be the Master looter.
Go to look for an exp group with back back space and zero coin on you.
Practice PP. Loot all the mobs and split them up appropriately. The casters
sitting on their butts will usually like this as they tend to get shafted on
loot at these levels. You get the benefit of finding out who the loot whores
are. They don't trust anybody and try to loot before the mob drops.

Dungeons are good fun but too many folk think the game starts at 45 50
whatever. Guilds are handy and if you can bring your own group to do a
dungeon crawl to an empty one they are fun. Add in several wipe-outs
horrible CR's new exploration and exp bonus. They are a blast. Most time you
come out ahead on exp even with a few deaths. Also a good time to set up
mentality that all activities are not for exp.

Ok shutting up now.
