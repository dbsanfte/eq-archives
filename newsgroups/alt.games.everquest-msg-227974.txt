Not to say I'm having a conversation with myself here or anything (ahem),
but the description below (from a different thread here) is a perfect
example of what I was referring to:

Exactly right. Since nerfing a class has such high negative consequences for
the game designers (alienating paying customers who play the nerfed class),
they usually choose the other route. The result being that gradually more
and more classes are filling the same functions for groups, a form of steady
inflation.


Ooo, I thought of another possible new basic character function: what if
operating in the underwater environment became a serious part of the game,
and doing it successfully as a group involved more than just enduring
breath? Like some whole zones or dungeons that are underwater, and only
certain melee classes have the particular underwater-fighting
skill(s)....could be some racial aspect to it as well, like vah shir
beastlords and their warders are terrible at fighting mobs underwater while
iksar BSTs/warders are good at it....some casting classes can bring their
DPS or healing or CC to this environment well, others can't....etc. And
you'd need to make the need to group underwater be something that regular
groups want to reckon with, in other words for example certain LDoN
adventures might require operating underwater for a bit to get the win.
Certain loot-juicy mobs in places like LOIO try to pull your tank underwater
for the fight. Etc.

So now we'd have a whole new layer to the class-balance aspect, and for
example instead of giving monks lull which doesn't actually give them a
unique function, make them the DPS class that kicks butt underwater. To give
clerics back some of their uniqueness now that druids have a semi-CHeal,
have only the cleric CHeal work underwater. And so forth.
