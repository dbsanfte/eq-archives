Two Stories, both stupid mistakes on my part.

During my month of playing when I was a wee Barbarian Warrior, my Shaman
friend and I decided to make the run from Halas to Freeport.  It all went
relatively smooth and we avoided all possible trouble and arrived safely
in N.Ro.  We zone into Freeport and run to the gates so I could bind.  In
my excitement I start to hail the guards, but unfortunately back in those
days, I was not aware that simply hitting h would do the trick.  So I type
out h, press the "a" and see the familiar "Loading, Please Wait" a mere
seconds later.  I pop back in to Halas and I get a tell from my friend
saying he was on his way back.  Boy was he pissed.

The second was when I first started my Iksar Shadowknight (my very first
character).  I zone into the world and start to /con everything, and upon
seeing the Red lettering and the what would you lie your tombstone to say
I froze.  I did not want to move as I thought that everyone was going to
attack and kill me.  So before I actually got to move anywhere I did a sit
and camp, and thus started my Barbarian Warrior.  Upon seeing the same
thing, I called my friend up and asked why everything wanted to kill me,
he went on to explain that I was a moron and they would not hurt me.

God was I stupid when I first started.
