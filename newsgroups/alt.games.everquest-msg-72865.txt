I was wondering if anyone else had or having the same problem as I am.  When
I click "Connect" a box comes up and tells me that I need to update my Video
card drivers from version 3161 to either  3286 or 7206, and I have version
7206 intalled already.  Then When I go into my charcter selection the
background for my charcter is black but I can see my charcter and the rest
of the screen, and when I get into the game all I can see is my buttons and
everything is black also.  The only way I can fix it is to go back to the
connect screen and start over and it works fine after that.  Any ideas will
help.

Thanks in advance

My System is:
PIII 933
512 Ram
ATI Radeon 8500
Sound Blaster Live Platium

I do have all the latest drivers installed.
