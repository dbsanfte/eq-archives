As a cleric you might be able to pass in one of the easier groups in the 
planes (like rats/goos in PoD) at 52 but it you'd be pushing it. It 
would be very hard to find a group at that level so you'd probably have 
to bring a group.

For exping/raiding I'd say get a few more levels on the cleric before 
you go PoP. At 56 it is very possible to find pickup groups there.
