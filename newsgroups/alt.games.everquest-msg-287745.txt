Yeah, I thought so too.

On Test you can no longer suspend or unsuspend mercs during combat, 
don't know if thats Live yet or not.  Also, currently merc apprentice 
healers only get a 90% rez.

On the bright side, the buffs they get are equal to ones a cleric would 
get at your level... when I dinged 60 my merc got Aego.

One trick: if you are happy soloing normally, and really stingy about 
money, get a healer merc, and unsuspend it only long enough to get fully 
buffed up when buffs run out.  Higher end buffs (temp plus, so thats a 
pretty moderate version of high end) last a long long time... and since 
your timer only runs while the merc is active, you can get quite a few 
recasts out of a single 5 minute charge.   Plus of course you won't care 
at all about merc Confidence, so you can get Tier One.
