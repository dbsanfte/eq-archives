The more I play WoW the less I feel like purchasing it.   Not because of
the crowd playing now, but because it just isn't grabbing my attention
as well as I thought it would.

I am only level 10 on 3 different characters so that may change as
things advance.

The "first to strike gets the loot" thing seems open for exploit in a
big way to me.  That in itself is giving me pause, and that is in direct
relation to the maturity level.
