The logic stretches stopped being an attempt at "establishing the
basis for common understanding that underlies any well-reasoned
discussion" before they even started. And, frankly, you can take the
"there he goes again" attitude and shove it up your ass. When people
try to pick fights with me, they'll get it. But it's THEIR fucking
fault. NOT MINE. If you don't want a god damned fight with me, THEN
STOP TRYING TO PICK THEM! And this "No, I'm not picking a fight,
you're just oversensitive" BULLSHIT is flimsier than fucking tissue
paper. Dickheads here get some sick, perverted pleasure out of arguing
with me, then the fucking parrots jump in with the "Oh, he's just
being his usual asshole self routine" when I try to defend myself. Get
the FUCK over it. Find someone else to be the newsgroup scapegoat, I'm
fucking sick of it.

Oh, but then if I point out what's going on, I'm called "overly
defensive" and/or "paranoid". What a fucking crock. Seriously, re-read
this discussion and tell me there was ANY reasonable purpose to the
stupid nitpicking. Honestly. Don't lie to save face. Don't lie to back
up your buddies. Be honest for once.

Oh, but taking my side is taboo, so I don't expect honesty...
