Except that every file on those CDs has been updated since the CD was 
burned, so you are going to have to patch them all.

To the OP: as was stated, yes you can transfer your eq directory in part[1] 
or in whole to a new pc and it will run.
[1] I added just the old world and a few selected luclin and kunark zones to 
a laptop with limited hard drive space.  In the event of using only parts of 
an expansion make sure that the source files are all patched before transfer 
and then on the new machine under advanced options in the patcher uncheck 
all the expansions you don't want to use in their entirety.
