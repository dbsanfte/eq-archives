You don't have to do that stuff anymore, and I think EQ is different,
and in a way not as good because of it.

How many folks are still working low level noob toons, with no twinks?
I tried with a rogue a few weeks ago.  The easy part is Gloomingdeep
now.  You can leave comfortably at level 8 with gear and a charm.
Even some money.  No more bashing skellies outside the walled gate at
the dwarf city to sell for your first backpack.

But then it gets way harder.  No groups, not even duo's around.  So
you end up having to solo most of the time.  Solo rogue doesn't get
backstab skill much...hehe.

I was surprised to find a couple folks leveling up on Orc Hill the
other day.  Departed with a few 49th level DS's for them to make the
going grand.

I missed the first wave in Combine (too busy wit my main), and might
have liked to see that progression again.

Are there any guilds on EMarr that are starting in early content?  I
think I may start one myself.  Maybe in a month we will be doing the
shawl quest!!  Lemme know if anyone would be interested.
