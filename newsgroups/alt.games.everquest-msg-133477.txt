I've taken my level 10 monk through echo caverns to the town in Fungus
Grove.  No problems at all.  You just need to steer around those wiggly
plants.  Stay out of their range, and no roots or blood sucking at all.
You can even go in walk mode.  No speed required... just reasonably
careful navigation.

This quest is well worth the trouble, and a snap
if you can bind at the Trade Commisioner and gate back.  Run it
4-6 times to get up to ally con with most merchants.
