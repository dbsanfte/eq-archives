Saw Charm of Deception drop in Nadox in the shrine last night.  Adds 6 STA 
10 DEX and 10 CHA when "your apparent form is not your true form" (ie: you 
have an illusion/wolf/tree form up).

I (54 ranger) was grouped with a 63 bard (who wanted the charm) and a 56 
cleric.  The named spawned right after we killed 
a_random_spawn_in_the_shrine294 and was dark blue to me; went down without 
much effort at all.

I was really expecting to get another from the luggald broodmother, but all 
she dropped was a caster back piece.  Made the cleric happy though ;)
