Yeah, but it's in response to a question that makes it quite obvious that 
Pure Casters is at least a fairly well-known meme:

****************
Clerics, shaman and druids are Pure Casters?? 
I've been under the impression since I started in '99, that wiz, mage, 
ench, and necro's are the only Pure Casters-as they have no other 
abilities but their magic (with out going into huge discussion that necro 
can 'tank/melee" with their pet-to a degree). And if a shaman is a Pure 
Caster, than where do the beastlords fall? And why not add 
Shadowknight/pally to the list.
****************

So, officially Verant calls anyone who isn't a hybrid or a melee a pure 
caster.  A significant percentage of the userbase uses another definition 
for pure caster.  
Now are you going to say that Verant knows their game as well as their 
userbase?  (Only halfway kidding here.)
