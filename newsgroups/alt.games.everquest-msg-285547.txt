When theres 40 people in a raid, you need to be able to heal everyone, so 
that means with the standard UI) watching 40 health bars. Srure you can 
assign healers to groups, but other healers die, and some grups dont have 
healers, so in practice just watching your own group doesnt work.

CTRA gives you an emergency monitor which is a small window with the most 
damaged people in it. Takes a bit of the concentration needed to stare at 40 
health bars. Same for decursive, it picks a target and casts a decurse, 
rather than looking at 40 small windows for your raid and picking one with 
the curse icon and decursing them (then to maybe find they are out of range 
or line of sight).

Neither are necessary, they just make it less of a headache, and thats one 
of the reasons people tend not to play healers and they are generally hard 
to find. I would imagine a pure dps class had the least need for addons. A 
hunter, or maybe rogue?

I can see a lot of helers just giving up after this new patch. I know 
personally Im not going to bother trying to play whack a mole on 40 health 
bars, and then when people start dying (as they will) cos I missed someone, 
get cussed out for it. When a game ceases to be fun its time to stop.
