Very big.  I had the beta install disk and the download for release
was still 8GB.  And since I was downloading the night before pre-order
open it took about a day and a half.

I'm running at 2.8GHz, 1GB ram, ATI x1650 Pro 512MB AGP video.  I
upgraded the video from ATI 9600 AIW to the 1650 and it still runs
like crap.
Not the actual movement in the game, that's ok (choppy at times but
for the most part completely acceptable).  The problem I have is the 9
crashes in 2 hours, pissed me off royally.

However, I have not written the game off forever, just until some
optimization patches have been completed.
The game is very cool; nice graphics (though that has bever been my
first concern), tons of quests (though you start to feel like a rat in
a maze eventually, but just go out and beat on some bozo's and all is
right again), decent interface, and diplomacy.  That last part alone
is worth the game imo.  Very cool stuff.

But it is a ginormous pig.  Some people I play with run with similar
systems but have 2 or 3GB ram and they say they no issues.  So I guess
get alot of ram....
