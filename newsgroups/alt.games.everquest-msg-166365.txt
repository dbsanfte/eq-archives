He is really trivial to do with a shaman pet.

Clear the silly boglings first, at 56 I could single pull them from around
the Saprophyte.

Stand in the passage just out of LOS, sick buffed pet on him.

Get LOS, cast Slow, move out of LOS.

Get LOS, cast DoT as needed.  ( I think one, maybe two dots were needed).

Get LOS, heal pet as needed.

Loot the corpse.

I never got summoned.
