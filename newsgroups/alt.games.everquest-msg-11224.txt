Not really a big fan of the Crying Freeman comics or the, much later, Manga
Cartoons. I did quite like the live action film (not the most exciting
project from Mark Dacascos but very stylish, I thought)

The name is my old Quake2 and Quake3 gaming nick (my real name is Freeman)
and I've posted under it since 1998 and I still post to both Q2 and Q3
newsgroups. My gaming nick has since changed but people still know me as CF
(even when using a different nick) seems no point in changing it now.
