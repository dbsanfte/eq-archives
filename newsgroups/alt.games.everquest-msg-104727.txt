I once read a post on a discussion board from a cleric complaining
about the same thing, about players who would continually pull more
than they could handle, then run to the cleric asking for heals
(basically trying to get the cleric to PL him).  The cleric said his
solution was to start fearing the mob instead of healing the player!

(I wonder how many times the player went to the cleric for help after
that? :-) )
