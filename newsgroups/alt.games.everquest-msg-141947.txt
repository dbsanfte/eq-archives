Bullshit.  If you really believe that, you are an idiot.  There are
6 billion people on this planet, and quite a few of them would gladly
kill/maim/torture you for fun or profit, you cannot survive just the
existence of other humans without being part of a large-scale social
organization, let alone the potential depredations of the so-called
natural world.   Do you grow all your own food?  make all your own
clothing?  mine, smelt, refine, manufacture, and etc. all your own
goods?

You have expressed the attitude of a selfish and ignorant twit.  The
world is one whole helluva a lot bigger and nastier than your nursery,
and you _cannot_ handle it alone.  This is why people band together to
form goverments and other social organizations.  You would not exist
were it not for the goverment supported by the taxes you are whining
about.  Grow up.
