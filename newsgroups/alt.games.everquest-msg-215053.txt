It was also two different adventures, which may change the totals, its really
hard to figure out whats going on when you change more than one variable at a
time.

I listed several possible ways to calculate the "average" in a post in another
thread.  One was "add all the levels and divide by number of toons" (youd get
383/6 avg 63.8333, rounds up to 64 or less likely down to 63 for your first
group, and  376/6 avg 62.666 rounds up to 63 or less likely down to 62, a
spread of 1.1666666.)  Another was to just add the levels together, which would
spread you the same ratio, 383 to 376, but which would make 4 and 5 man groups
radically different from the straight average level plan, and which I suspected
is what they would use.

Neither of these methods, though, accounts for a drop from 51 to 34 points,
though.  Thats a full third off, not 1/64th, not 1/63rd, but 1/3rd!

Lets see, another method proposed was lowest level in group, but thats not it,
since you got different results with the same lowest level... same for the
highest level in group, you had same highest.  Mean... well in both cases your
mean is 65, so thats not it.

I can't think of a method of finding an average of any sort that would account
for a 1/3rd drop for a 1/64th drop in total levels.  Thinking further, lets say
a group of 6 level 65s would get 65 points, even a group of 6 level 58s should
get at worst 58 points.  No wait, lets subtract the 20 minimum, assume a group
of level 20s each gets one point, so the level range is from 1 to 51.  58-20 is
38, 65-20 is 45.  For the 6 level 65s to get 51 points, that would be 113% of
their level range point (45) 113% of 38 is 43.  So no, even using those
calculations, dropping the entire group from level 65 (and you didn't start
with all level 65s) to dropping the entire group to level 58s ( but you only
dropped one, four were still 65s) still wouldn't logically account for such a
huge drop in points.  If a group of all 65s gets more than 51 points for a
"normal" mission, then the calculation gets even worse.

My guess, unsupported by facts of course, is that the different mission you
undertook, or the fact that you used steath to buypass some of the mobs to
complete the mission, or the amount of time you took for the mission, must have
had some effect, in addition to any generated by your rather paltry drop in
average levels.

Very interesting, we need a lot more information to figure out whats really
going on, though.  Anyone else care to chime in?
