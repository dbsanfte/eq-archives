How much do you want to bet that the new food changes are going to screw
low level non-twinked monks? If a stack of lightweight food (muffins and
milk) is only going to be considered a "snack" now, that means that
monks will either have to start hauling around heavy "hearty meals" or
run to town every half an hour. I'm not rejoicing over the new changes
until I see em in action. My guess is my level 18 monk gains 1 stone
weight allowance, and loses 2 stones to heavier food and drink to
maintain the same length of nourishment I used to get from 20 muffins
and 20 milk.
