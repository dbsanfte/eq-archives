That's funny.  I have a 26 necro that I rarely play.  Ever since I hit level
5 with my bard and got selo's, it's REALLY difficult to play other
characters, merely because of the speed and that fact that I'm impatient.
Anyway, was taking the necro out for a spin and was hating the slowness.  I
passed two druids in the middle of nowhere talking.  I thought about asking,
told myself "NO!", took a few more slow steps and then cursed myself for
heading back to druids to ask for a sow...
I got as far as saying something to the effect of "I really hate to ask
but...." and he cast it on me as I was hitting enter with my whiney plea for
help.

I still felt wierd about it.

Sean...
