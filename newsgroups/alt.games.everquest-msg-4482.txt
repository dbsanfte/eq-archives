    If you're talking about guildmasters dying, both High Keep and Qeynos
have been sacked for certain as Verant-sponsored events. When Qeynos was
sacked, it was mentioned that it was the last city to be wiped out - so I
assume all cities have been cleared at least once. Likely not more than
once, either - guildmasters aren't exactly easy targets.
