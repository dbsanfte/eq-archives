Try Crypt of Nadox.  The place starts out with greens and light blues to you 
and will get dark blue as you move in.  All mobs have a chance to drop a gem 
as well most have a chance to spawn a named upon it's death.  Many areas where 
you could pull solo.  Zone is divided up into different sections and each 
section usually has a tunnel connecting them that is a safe place to pull to.  
Some sections have mobs that drop cash, or drop weapons that sell for around 
5pp each or better.  Some sections have undead but i've found them to be the 
higher level mobs in the zone.  I really suggest you check it out.  Right now 
it's my favorite zone and I plan to be here leveling and raking in the cash 
for quite a while.
