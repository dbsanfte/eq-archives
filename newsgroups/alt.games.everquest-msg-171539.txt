I don't believe it was the only cause, but I'm willing to bet that the "high
profile" actions of certain wizards contributed to the ease by which they
came to the decision to go ahead with the nerf.

Aye.  We've tried Grummus a few times, and the Manaetic Behemoth once.  Very
hard encounters, and we've yet to pass those ones.  But for all the shit
that they can put out... massive DoT's, quad hit 800's with a 2000 damage
proc, AE silence, grav flux, etc...  they don't really have a lot of hit
points.     Throw in 3 manaburners and the fights would be easy.   6
manaburners and they would be killed dead.

Also, consider what the level 65 cap and the planar power / innate
enlightenment have done.   A decked out 65 wizard (320? 340 int?) these days
probably has 2 or more times the mana they had at level 60 in top of the
line Luclin equipment.  What can a manaburn wizard do in one shot these
days, considering they were normal MB hitting for 8k, and crits to 17k
before....?

How many hit points would either of those two encounters have to have to
survive a serious manaburn assault from todays wizards, had the change not
went through?
