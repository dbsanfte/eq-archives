In the real world it would be bleeding obvious which mob was a charmed 
pet and which wasn't.

For starters in the real world there aren't three identical anythings 
that can stand in the same physical space.

And 2nd. its very easy to tell in the real world which ones are hitting 
you and which ones are hitting eachother.

And 3rd... I'm surprised the enchanter isn't given a blue-halo buff 
specifically for the purpose of differentiating his charmed pet from the 
others, or previous to GoD marking to differentiate same named mobs in 
pulls. He is an enchanter after all, illusions are his thing... making 
it easy to tell things apart sounds like a useful class ability not an 
exploit.
