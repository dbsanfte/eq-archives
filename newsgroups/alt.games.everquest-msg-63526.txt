Did something similar myself I guess, but I fell in "The Hole" and no one
would help me get my stuff back.  This is what I did;

1) Split Paw Gnolls for basic gear until you can get back on your feet.

2) Testament of Vanear is fairly easy quest... if you time it right.

3) Shiny Brass shield in crushbone is another fairly easy one if you time it
right.  Of course it is a more rare drop, so may have to kill a few times,
but he is easy.

4) Initiate of Tunare is nice basic quest, stepping toward larger better
things.  Ghasts are sometimes hard to find in Lesser Fay and don't always
drop the hearts too.

5) If now one will help with weapons (my brother did hook me up there), try
maybe Screaming Mace or something similar.  Enamled Black Mace was mine
before I got killed.  After that, my brother got me an Iceclad War Paw
(really nice 1 HS).


There are others, but I would avoid Merchant Armour if you can.  Just kill
some animals for pelts if you have to, and make your own.

Same with bags.  Tailored Bags have weight reduction and are fairly easy as
far as skills go.  I try to carry one Bearskin Bag for all the stuff I
forage (at 150 now, I never have to buy food or drink).

Best of luck,
Ridge (29 Druid)
