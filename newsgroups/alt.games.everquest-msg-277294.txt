I finally caved in and resubscribed to EQ the other day.  I had been
out of it for almost two years.  I've always been a casual player;
after 4 years of playing my highest was a level 52 druid.  I admit it,
I wanted to get in on the uber dolly.

So I login with my druid, and much to my shock there was someone else
on in my old guild (which had merged with another, and I thought the
old guildname had been disbanded).  Also, it was my best in game
friend from "the old days" playing a twinked 41 ranger.  We had a fun
little adventure getting each of us the uber dolly.  He got jumped by
two drachnids in FV (he forgot some could see invis), and I almost
froze up trying to remember what each of my spells did and where I had
them in my spell slots.  I took the brute force path and just nuked
them into submission, remembering to get off a heal to save my buddy.
Graceless, but at least no one died.

So we got our free goodies and chatted until way too late; no xp
gained, but a fun night that made me glad I resubscribed.

The next night, I login with my 40 Enchanter and figure I'll get him
the Phree L00tz.  I did a "/w all 38 42" to see where people were
hunting at my level, and only 12 people came back.  There was a group
in Lavastorm and a few more in some zone I never heard of, plus a
couple in the bazaar (I'm missing the last four expansions still).
Hrm.  I'm close to the Dreadlands, so I decide to go try my old
stomping grounds and solo for a bit.  It was weird to be one of only 3
people in DL.

This was about the time that I remembered that I never soloed with my
ENC, and I couldn't remember what good tactics were.  I found a
plaguebone camp in the NE corner of DL, and charmed one of them and
set him about beating his friend.  Roughly 3 seconds later, charm
broke and they both tore after me.  I had been standing too close to
the fight, and wasn't sow'd.  I also forgot about my stun spell.  Did
I mention I forgot to root the target?  Yeah, that too.  I fruitlessly
tried to channel a mez through the mess and soon found myself back in
POK.  CR time!

I'm not sure what I was thinking, but I figured I'd try the same thing
again.  I didn't alter my tactics much, except to back off more (at
this point I had still forgotten I even had a root spell).  Smack
smack dead.  Corpse #2!  I didn't care about the xp loss (being gone
for two years does that), I was just trying (and failing) to get my
game legs back.  So I pretty much called it a night with my ENC, and
decided that the game isn't as much fun without friends along (the
same conclusion I came to two years ago).

The third night, last night, I went around to a bunch of my under 10's
that I wanted to keep for sentimental reasons.  I found my level 6
paladin in *partial* patchwork, birthdate 3/24/99 (the day I signed
up), and actually got him the uber dolly as well, just for giggles.
At level 6, this shmuck has more than 30 hours /played.  Hey, I was
learning the game.

Other random thoughts on my return:

* I love the new sky.  

* I'm looking forward to the merger; zones really were depressingly
empty (and I'm sure I no longer know where popular zones are anyway).

* I had a *ton* of fun running around with my low level alts (levels
4-6).  Maybe because it kicked up the most nostalgia.  *shrug*

* My thoughts were to focus on my enchanter more than my druid, but
I'm having second thoughts now.  If I can't find groups, I'll go with
my druid or one of a myriad of mid 20's characters I have.  Or maybe
that little level 6 paladin. :)

* Window micromanagement is a pain.

* I saw lots of "new" windows in passing that I'll need to read up on.
Sheesh a lot has changed.

* Sounds like Lanys is having a big farewell bash on Sunday in EC.  We
merge with The Seventh (and lose our name) on Monday.  I hope to see
some more old friends there.
