Some, The level of /shout /ooc and general st00pid-d00d-ness is much
lower.
There are guilds / groups that do strictly RP.
Meeting random players it is a bit more hit and miss, but much better
than on other servers.

More empty than other servers, but you can still find pick up groups
etc.
I would suggest trying to find a guild or regular group though,
especially if you want to get anywhere near the higher levels fast.

There are some fun anomalies on FV with the changes to no drop and
trivial loot codes. These can be interesting to explore.

Oh and find a regular group or guild, or did I mention that already.

HTH,

Jim
