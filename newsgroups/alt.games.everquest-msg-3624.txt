I'll try this, but I've spent a lot of time practicing this med
bounce step, and never noticed that the first spell cast
after doing so took any more mana than usual.

If, as you suggest, the effect is gradual instead of
on cycle, then I'd -still- sitting for 3.5 of every 4.0
seconds, so there would logically be no real difference
between my "oops, sometimes I missed a cycle" and
your "hmm, I'm wasting a fraction of each cycle"

Now If I was suggesting timing things such that you
stand most of the time and only sit just as the cycle
hits, there would be a large difference, with my
"on the cycle" system I'd get full med benefit where
as if the system works as you suggest I'd get only
1/8th the med benefit.

Still, I'll make a point of checking, because I can
easily imagine a system whereby you get credit
for medding during a cycle only if you were sitting
for the -whole- cycle.  That was my original assumption,
in fact, until I was introduced to this concept.
