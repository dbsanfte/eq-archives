Strange. My standard reply now has become "burn in hell plz kk thx" to people
who say "sow plz".

If I'm in a particular area for an extended period of time, however, the
answer is "Sure, no problem! come find me and I'll be happy to give you
something.", at which point a quick bit of levitate, sow and invis will
generally provide me with hours of amusement. If they find me quickly
they get the much requested copper piece (Spare a copper for a poor
newbie?).

If they actually perservere, or more shockingly, display a sense of humour
about stuff they generally get buffed, and have it gently pointed out they
could have made more experience hunting monsters than hunting me for
2 hours.
