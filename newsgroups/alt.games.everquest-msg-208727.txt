You might get some bites if you expounded on what you already have.  Hell,
graphics engine done, gimme $5k and I'll have a developers license on a
graphics engine identical to EQ's.  Details, people on the internet are
skeptics (who wouldn't be after being told you need a bigger penis by the
son of an assassinated Zambian prime minister?).

Might I suggest a website.  There's a reason the web became so popular. 
It's very good for things just like this.  :)  Then come here and post a
link with a little description.  If you've got something good, you'll hear
it.
