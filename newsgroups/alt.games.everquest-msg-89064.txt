FWIW, I dropped three hill giants in rathe mountains last night...each had a
fine steel weapon, either a rune or words, and an average of 2pp each...same
I could get from ulthorks WAY easier, or even the myriad giants in great
divide...not worth it in my opinion.  On the other hand, the day before I
killed two (had never before and was high enough to solo them now), and one
had 29pp and one had 34 pp...and both had roughly double that in gold...but
I agree with the others here, better ways to make plat that is MUCH less
competitive with others...
