I buy the computers at work.  For the last few years they've been only Dell
(about 3 dozen).

In fact, I have two 4300s (both P4 1.6) on my desk right now (typing on one,
setting the other up).  Neither makes much noise.

Dell has decent support.  YOU call them up and say that the computer is very
noisy.  But before you do, open it up and pinpoint what's making the noise.
If it's something easily replaced they'll probably just send the part.  If
you don't feel comfortable fixing it, ask them to come out.  I believe they
have next day service if you call them by 5pm local (to you) time.

I suspect the CD-ROM drive myself.  Try hitting the eject button when it
gets noisy.
