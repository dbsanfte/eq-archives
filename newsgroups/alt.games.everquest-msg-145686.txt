Although nowhere near starting on my cleric epic, I like the sound of this.
Makes the spawn of Ragefire in the player's control rather than waiting
around for the thing to spawn, waiting lists whatever.  Wish they would do
this with all of the normally camped spawns.  Make the quest epic extend out
to questing for the mob as well.  Seems to make more sense than the
traditional wait 7 days for said mob to spawn, and pray to Tunare that the
mob drops whatever item it is you need.  Of course I could be wrong and this
could make things worse but if the fine points are worked out I could see
this working really well with all the contested spawns out there.
