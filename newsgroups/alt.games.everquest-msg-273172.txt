I doubt that this mob alone would pose a challenge to the guilds
fighting him. A single tank backed up by a rock solid ch chain simply
won't fall. Sure a bit luck is needed since I assume Mata Muram can one
round said tank. That aside a single mob can't stop a raid. (Sleeper
obviously is an exception due to his fast DT ability)

The effect doesn't seem to have counters so the only way to get rid of
it seems to be dispell. Or one of the cleric/shaman cure AAs though I'm
not sure there.

After all I think there is alot more going on than a single end mob. But
I find it a bit funny that SoE needs to cut stats by 300 to even make an
encounter interesting.
