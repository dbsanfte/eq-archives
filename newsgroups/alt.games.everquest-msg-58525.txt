... and when a group of 6 ganks a single mob, you get a damage multiplier 
on them, without reduced EXP.  In fact, you get MORE exp by having this 
full group.

First off, it would be a bitch to implement well, and easily exploited.  
Secondly, do those soloist really -need- more EXP per quad?  Nay, I say.

Groups that can handle multiple mobs ( chain-pullers ) -already- pull as 
many as they can handle with mezzing and parking.  Why would they pull more 
than that?  TPW.  All it would do is change the strategy so that they would 
get this "bonus", however the "bonue" rules are implemented.

I can't think of 1 good reason to implement something like this.  I'd like 
to hear one, though, if there is a good reason.
