Interesting note from that link:

>>>Extra note: The recent experience system change has granted 40% extra xp
per kill to hybrids thereby basically eliminating the experience penalty.
But, this modifier is applied AFTER the zone experience modifier, meaning
you get an extra 40% more of this as well. So, for my paladin who gets 133%
experience in Kedge Keep, then an extra 40%, resulting in a 86.2% total
boost. Subtract the 40% hybrid penalty and we're still left with 46.2
percent instead of 33 percent bonus!
