Hi there,

My dramas "slightly" continue.

I installed everquest and teh two first expansions. Suffered the horror
patch download (took 12 hours)...everquest now works fine.

But I cant run the tutorial, get some bizzare message of "The procedure
entry point could not be located...etc"

1. Is it worth me reinstalling the whole game, going through patch nightmare
to run the tutorial? Is it a worthy thing to experience for a newbie?

2. If I reinstall Everquest, will this affect my online account at all. Or
is my cd-key locked in with my username and password..and as long as I just
normally re-log in with those, (even with a freshly installed copy)..Ill be
ok?

3. On a side note..what are these optional patches that I can download? (If
I tick the the blank spaces next to the expansion names in the advanced
menus of the patch program) They add about 5 hours worth of downloading.
game seems to work fine without them?

Thanks

PEte
