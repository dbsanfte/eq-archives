Doesn't matter, there are always some who are not paying enough 
attention.  It always happens.  It is just too difficult to try to police 
individual people and their pets rather than just make a blanket rule.  
Experience on raids has taught us that this is the only viable solution.

The amount of DPS is not worth the risk.  If you want to have a pet, get 
pet discipline.  If you can't get pet discipline, don't have a pet.  The 
enchanter summoned pets are just not worth the risk, they do not add that 
much DPS to a raid.  The only exception we make is charmed pets for some 
mobs where it really makes a difference, and is worth the risk.
