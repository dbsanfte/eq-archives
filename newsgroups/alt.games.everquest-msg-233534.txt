Hehe I also have had my moments of UBER... but to the uninitiated, I
didn't want to scare him too bad. To newbie crowd controllers the idea
of having 10 to 15 blue beasties sitting in a holding pattern just waiting
for the first fizzle would be enough to frighten them out of wanting to
try our most excellent class. I was only speaking of an "average day"
(if you can call ANY day an average day when enchanting is involved.)

I recall doing "public service" at 30th lvl at the bridge in Blackburrow.
Had everyone in the zone (about 30 ppl) running trains past me for
over an hour. Had 4 trains area mezzed on and under the bridge at
1 time..... never got to count the total gnolls, since they tend to hide
inside each others pockets...... yes, they were green, but to the ppl
i saved, most were yellow or red..... hehehe
