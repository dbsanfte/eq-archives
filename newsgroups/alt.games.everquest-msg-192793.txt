Same, I couldnt hit back either, nor could I send my pet on it.

I wonder what they are addressing with the patch today, it seems they have a
lot of things that need attention.  They messed a lot of things up with the
4/8 patch.  A significant number of people cant connect at all, and they
seem to have introduced item poofing bugs for a smaller number of people.  I
had two items poof after a trade, something I have never personally seen in
3 1/2 years of playing the game.
