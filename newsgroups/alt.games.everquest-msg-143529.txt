That's why I recommended you use the bazaar.  The bazaar actually does
a good job of telling you what is good and what you should spend.  The
only time it actually does not do good is when there are not many
items listed up for sale.  This is why I recommended you try several
times throughout the day - to get a better picture of prices.  And, of
course, don't try after a server crash when there are 30 people in the
zone.

In fact, coming here for prices may not help at all, as prices are not
the same across all servers.  As seen elsewhere on this thread,
batskull earrings go for 100pp on one server and 200pp to 400pp on
another.

Also, perhaps you did not realize that you could view an items
statistics directly through the bazaar window?  I hold the right mouse
button down on the name of the item to view its stats.

Most items will have plenty of selection.  You can figure out for
yourself what is a good price and what has the stats you are looking
for.  The one I've found to be difficult to scope out is the
+int/+mana gloves.  As a result, my wizard still wears cloth gloves at
level 46.  The ones available are usually too costly (500pp+) for me.
