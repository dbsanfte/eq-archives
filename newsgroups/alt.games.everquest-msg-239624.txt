True.  But as a mover and saker, very few come close.  His charaisma was
based on demagoguery, that's why he was able to do so much in so little
time.  He had very little sway over people after his death, though.  The
others you mentioned, had long lasting effects, and generally had more
influence after death.  My contention is that this would be due to the
message, rather than the messenger.  I would contend that Hitler was both
crazy (read Mein Kampf!) and possibly brilliant (see what he did and how he
did it, including all the Machiavellian manoeuvering he was able to pull
off).  However, his hatred and insanity prohibited his ability to fully
utilize his charisma and inate intelligence (look at how he treated Ukraine
when they initially hailed the Germans as liberators).

Well... this has truly gotten off-topic, now.
