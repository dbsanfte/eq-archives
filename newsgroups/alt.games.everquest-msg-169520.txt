Yeah, until you ask here or on the message board how
you start up your account after you quit. Then you'll find out
you can get your characters undeleted and restored with your stuff, as
long as you did not destroy/drop/give away your stuff.

Then you'll be back in EQ cursing yourself, waiting for that day when
you find "the holy grail." The grail is the mmorpg that is actually
anywhere near good enough to take you permanently away; it does not
exist yet. People will tell you that it is "the next mmorpg coming
out", they've been saying that for several years now.

So have a good vacation, see you soon.
