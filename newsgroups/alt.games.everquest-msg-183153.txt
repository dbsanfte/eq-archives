On my main computer, many of the PCs, NPCS show up as having the color
black skin at certain points of their body, or their whole body.  My
high elf, for example, has some black patches on her ears, and a
Felwith NPC may have the usual head but black on her arms, chest,
legs. The clothes show up correctly, it's just the skin that's wrong.
Any recommendations on how to fix this?
