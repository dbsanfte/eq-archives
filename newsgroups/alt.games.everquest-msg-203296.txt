So on patch day, midnight, Prexus crashes twice.

15 hours downtime,  they have to restore everybody from days old backups (we
personally lost 20 runes, amongst the other patchday elemental/ssra raiding
loots)

So it comes back up, eventually.... for a while.
Then back down and locked.  An hour later, they finally claim to have
resolved it.

Server was back up, even had 8 GMs to fix the mess (but not the endless
tells of amazing items lost, let alone levels, AA's..)... for a while.
About 4 hours later, it crashed again twice.

So now, a day later, Prexus crashes again, currently locked.

I remember many months back, a similar tale.  That time Prexus was down and
locked for 4 days or so.

Heres what Alan has to say anyway, below.

Fuckers =/  So remember, sucks that ALL items, exp etc for 1-3 days is gone
and unreplacable, but u may get a character back that u deleted many months
ago!

Fuckers =(

Trouble with the Prexus server

Last night at about 1:00 in the morning Prexus had a severe breakdown. Our
Operations team has been working to get it restored and back into service.
Our hope is that we'll have it back up and running some time this evening.

That's the bad news. The worse news is that we will have to recreate all of
the characters on the server from backups that are perhaps more than 24
hours old. Anything those characters have earned in the last day or so will
be lost. Unfortunately, we will not be able to restore items or experience
lost to the roll back.

There is some potential good news, though. If you have deleted a character
in the last year or so, that character may return. So if you see a character
that you deleted a few months ago on your character select screen, that's
why.

Important Note: The restoration of these characters may leave you with more
than eight characters on Prexus. In cases like this, the character select
screen will list your characters in alphabetical order, and only show you
the first eight of those characters. This may make some of your characters
appear to be missing. They are not missing. All you need to do is delete one
or more of the visible characters in order to see the ones that are not
shown.

We are extremely sorry that this has happened. We are doing everything we
can to restore the server.

Alan
