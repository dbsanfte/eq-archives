Interesting. I actually perfer it when I'm not chatting with friends in EQ. If
I want to talk with my friends, I call them or get together with them. EQ is
my own quiet little escape where I don't have to talk with people. The day it
stops being that is the day I quit. But then, that's the fun of EQ: it can be
so many different things for so many different people.
