checked your level, right now your best heal, mana/hp ratio-wise is actually
inner fire, only use true heals in combat, faster cycling time

and yea, i understand what you say
but take heart, by 24 i was playing healer to 5 tanks in the basement to HK
while nuking and buffing, make your tanks learn bind wounds, we are tthe
only class that can "buy" mana    :)

regen and canni come in at 24, and then you really start to shine, in the
mean time, focus on +mana items, they really are better than +wis til about
30th IMO
