Devs have commented in the past that Rampage + Earthshaker was the reason
why no further PBAOE weapons had been added to the game recently, and that
they would fix the code if they got around to tinkering with that part of

As someone else has posted, the suspicion is that they want to remove any
option for killing hundreds of LB mobs at once to avoid LoN booster pack
farming.
