    I know this sounds weird, but I like her too, when I read her posts.  She
posts the sort of content that I'd like to see more of on this newsgroup.  And
I'd be happy to meet her in game and group with her.  But it takes extra time
and effort to read top posted messages, and they simply annoy me.  I do find it
regrettable in this instance.

   I was tempted, but no.  I generally only KF top posters, and some freak named
End Time Prophet that infested our newsgroup, and several others, about a year
ago.  This guy did crazy right, and he was _every_ prolific.
