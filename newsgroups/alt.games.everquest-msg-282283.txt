I had groups in MPG,WoS or Tipt in mind on my initial post,usually the
puller keeps pulling until some of the keyclasses,slower,tank or
healer says afk cause his little sister has vomitted over his keyboard
or something like that.   :p
Even in WoS/MPG pickupgroups I see it very rarely happen,that one
of the key classes needs a medbreak,and humans need a bio break
from time to time,so I can easily let my mana run out slowly if
needed,the next biobreak will come without question and I can med up
to full.
