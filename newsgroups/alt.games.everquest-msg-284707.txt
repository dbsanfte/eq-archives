I just started back in eq and am trying a rogue class for the first time. 
He's up to 13 now and playing on a progression server.  The server is up to 
kunark with velious opening any day now.  I'm using throwing axes to pull 
because they have 120 yard range, but they are a little expensive and only 
stack up to 20.  I keep thinking  I should get a decent bow for a little 
more range, and so I could make large stacks of cheap arrows.  Is that at 
all an option for an untwinked character?  Should I skillup fletching enough 
to make my own bow or keep watching the bazaar channel to see if someone is 
selling one cheap?  Also, how does range work for bows?  Say if I had a bow 
with range 100 and an arrow with range 50 would I get total 150 range?
