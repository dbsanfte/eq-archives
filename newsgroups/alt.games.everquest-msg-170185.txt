*shrug* So go play in somebody's local vault NWN dungeon, that way
you can start with a thoroughly hacked character who treats dragons
as a light snack.  And even if you go AFK in the middle of a fight
with something that can nick you up a bit you can just respawn and
instantly take your "revenge" on the hapless mobs.

Having a substantial motivation to avoid virtual death has always
been an important part of EQ, one of its defining characteristics.
Without the prospect of a tough CR where's the virtual risk in
your virtual adventure?  PoP sounds to me much more like a MMOVG
than the EQ I've been playing for the last 3-1/2 years.  I think
that's why I've lost interest in playing Kaev (L55 Paladin) and
been playing lowbies lately.  Not that there's much pain involved
in a lowbie's death anymore, but at least I can play around with
some classes and races I've not tried before.

There're a bazillion video games out there, each of them much the
same as the last.  Likewise with so-called RPGs.  EQ used to be
quite a bit different, but that distinction has slowly eroded.
And the erosion has not been an external thing, competitors have
gone to some length to differentiate their games from EQ.  It's
been changes to EQ rather than the world around it.  EQ doesn't
stand out from the mass of other games quite the way it used to.
I wonder how long until it's just another game without anything
particularly special about it.
