So now that I've finally hit the mid-40's, I've started eyeing the
Coldain Shawl quests.  Part of this involves torching my Giant Faction
to get in good with the Coldain.  

I've also looked at the skyshrine armor thats available, and figured
that might be worth a try, seeing as CoV also goes up when wasting
giants.  I realize that the easiest way to gain mass quantities of CoV
faction would be to tag along on a raid into Kael and just play "tag",
but I have a couple questions:

1) Is there any real reason to do the middle step (kill Coldain, raise
Kael) before going to Skyshrine?  Can Kael be effectively ignored, or
is there some key quest that *MUST* be done?

2) Is there any easy way for a non-druid to scoot past Kael in
general, or am I  (a cleric) better off just hitting a druidic taxi in
PoK? (Is this even possible, or do you need to be flagged or
some-such?)

3) While I'm asking, is the Skyshrine stuff even worth trying for
anymore?  I don't like my chances of getting doing any raiding anytime
soon, but I could still use an upgrade here once I hit my 50's.

Thanks in advance,
