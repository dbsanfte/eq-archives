You mean Druids, Clerics and Wizards?

I'll grant you that Necromancers, Beastlords, and especially Mages are

a much.

Splendid One, 64 Gnomage, anticipating not having to summon new pet gear 
every time I zone or LD.

MMM, wonder if this will also let me stuff a pet in my back pocket and 
zone with him (the AA for this has been a dissapointment so far)
