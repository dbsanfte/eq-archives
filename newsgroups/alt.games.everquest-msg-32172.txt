    He DOES have a point, you know. Clerics are there to provide solid
regular healing, and excellent emergency protection. Symbols are part of
that emergency protection. I don't know about playing "poorly" as he
suggests, but you aren't doing what a cleric is supposed to be doing.

    There is a cleric like this on our server. He even organized a planes
raid, then brought no Peridots himself. His friends love him, but people who
don't know him well make a LOT of jokes about him.

    That having been said, there are SO MANY things in a pick-up group that
make it "sub-optimal" that I doubt this one will stand out - unless one
person INSISTS on Symbol. At this cleric's level, it usually isn't
necessary. When playing alts at Pinzarn level, the only one that asks for
Symbol is the warrior - and only then so the cleric can get maximum effiency
out of big heals. Even the enchanter is fine with just Valor-line. This all
changes once you hit Naltron level, though. That's when the money starts to
fly.

>The tanks know I don't keep components on me

    There IS a Brell! Count yourself lucky, then - I keep 160 Peridots on me
so I can stay away from a city for extended periods of time. This is a bit
much, as I mostly use Naltron's Mark, but it makes sure I never run out.
Only people that have ever handed me a peridot have been enchanters.

    Heh. So the cleric was OOM, even WITH the mana from not casting the
Symbol, and the tank wasn't healed and died? If the tank HAD the Symbol,
he'd still be dead, as the cleric would have gone OOM sooner. Remember, this
guy has Pinzarn or less, not Naltron. He's not yet in the "CHeal is insanely
efficient, and is my only heal" levels. At lower levels, it is a choice
between heals and symbols, at least if you're pulling non-stop.

    The only time you hear it is if they don't QUITE make it back to the
group on a pull. Then the complaints start. And pointing out why a Symbol
wouldn't have helped won't make things any less tense. ;-)
