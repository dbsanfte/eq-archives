This is probably bad form to reply twice to the same post but I had a
bit of time while running this morning to reflect on why I as a
"casual player" like LDoN so much, and what it boils down to is that
LDoN really defines the time that I spend playing.  Other than the
initial grouping, which usually isn't very long (perhap 10-30 minutes)
and is under my control (at any time I can say "sorry, have to log"),
everything else is well defined.

For example, I don't have to worry that I'm "letting the group down"
by logging after 3 hours.  The time limit is 90 minutes, and if we
complete the adventure and one or two people want to leave, I've never
had a group that gave them a hard time.  And it solves the "split the
loot" problem nicely.  In the past when I've left a group after 2 or 3
hours, the attitude has been "tough luck, you're leaving early, no
loot for you".
