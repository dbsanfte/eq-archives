Well, almost all.

When did sub-50 become the low-level game? I must have missed that survey.

<snicker>

Look for the most crowded zones in the game and you will find three
groupings, the low-level game is people coming up to or just past their
surname status, the mid-level game is anywhere from 30 to 45 (the end of
which is when people are seriously considering epics and such), and the
high-level game is still 50-60 and edging into the 61-65 range.

Anything past 60 is just icing, things that 90% or more of players will *
never see *, thus it qualifies as something beyond "high level", it goes
into an elite range where only the truly dedicated players are seeing room
for real growth of their characters, not the EQ gaming body as a whole.
