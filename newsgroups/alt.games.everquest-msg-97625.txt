Ayup.  I've noticed some oddities lately though.  My 45 cleric NEVER
gets interrupted.  My 29 Beastlord gets frequent interruption.  Damn
near 50% last night.  Granted, I'm pulling with her, frequently and do
the, "Run run run. Stop.  Count 1 banana, cast the spell.  Fsck,
interrupted.  Wait 1 banana, cast again" lather, rinse repeat
scenario.  About drove me nuts.  Started seeming worse the last week
or so.  Hmmm... which would be about the time she went back to Marus
Seru...  Hmm... wonder if this is somehow zone related?

Oh, interesting.  I'll give her a little shimmy before casting next
time.  Can't hurt, and usually a crowd pleaser..
