Lavastorm is excellent for you.  Mem up sow and  resist fire
and your skin buff.  then mem your anti summoned nuke, (ward
summoned i think) and fight lava crawlers, fire elementals
and imps/sprites in Lavasterm.  Snare them run ahead with
SoW and nuke.  Med rinse repeat aud nausem or until about
level 18/19 when it starts to green out more.
