In options have textures on low, instead of the often default high.
That is a HUGE memory/lag saver.

Enable ALL old models with no luclin models.

Put clipping on 5, if you put it on zero in the bazaar, then log off
you will get back on in the bazaar with it like its at ONE HUNDRED 
PERCENT and be lagged to hell and gone. So leave it at 5.

If, like me, you use all old models with velious textures again you
will be amazed how much better you run in the bazaar/jaggedpine/pok
etc. You'll probably end up just leaving it that way. All  the new
npcs, like the ones in POK and the relocated trolls in neriak, have
a wide variety of BEAUTIFUL velious textures on the old models. You
don't see that of course with luclin models, since they have no
velious textures.

I breeze around the bazaar pretty well, the final thing I do is turn
off all npc and player names. I turn player back on if I can't find a
particular person.
