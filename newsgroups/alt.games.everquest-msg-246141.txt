Excellent point. A lot of necros are bitching about not "getting anything" this
patch. They're wrong.

The extra HP regen doesn't work when you have a DoT running or when liching. But
it's still good - I can click off lich, BW a few times and be back to 70% in
practically no time, and then tap a greenie or a probe for the rest, or just tap
it out of the next mob.

I'm definitely spending the 3 AAs to get First Aid 3, and I've already Tinkered
myself a gauze press.
