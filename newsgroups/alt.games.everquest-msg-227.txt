The issue of continued charges isn't a consideration for initial price or
development costs. 

What is relevent is that some games don't charge for online play service,
but EQ does.  What is relevent is that those other games don't really
provide the same kind of "service" that Verant does for EQ...those other
games "services" don't have anywhere NEAR the kinds of costs as EQ.
