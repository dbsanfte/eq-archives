    She isn't on Firiona Vie faction. She's an epic quest NPC on her own
faction (True Spirit, IIRC). I always thought she was an enchanter epic NPC,
but Dan's not recognizing her name makes me wonder if I was right about
that.

    As for why you attacked the other PC: enchanter NPCs which charm PCs
have notoriously odd hate lists, and will send their newly-charmed victims
to attack all manner of things.
