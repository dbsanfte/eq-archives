KOS ghost is Lord Ghiosk, indifferent ghost is Vah'Shiir IIRC. Vah'shiir
has to be the dullest fight ever. The last reaver in the tower spawns
the indifferent Neh'Shiir for the mages. He regularly (for me at least)
seems to drop the Ornate Rune Shield, which casters go all funny over.

I've heard two hours myself. Plenty of goos and over crap around to
alleviate the tedium.
