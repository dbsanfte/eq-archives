First, there are several different kinds of Radeons.  I have 2 boxes
at home one has a Geforce2 MX400, the other is currently running an
ATI Radeon 8500.  Prior to the Radeon 8500, I had the first generation
Radeon 64 DDR VIVO (ie Radeon 7200).

The old Radeon was about as fast as the Geforce2 MX400, but had better
2d quality and far far superior DVD playback.  I also had fewer driver
problems than I've seen with the GeForce2 MX400.  I had few problems
playing EQ in Luclin with the old Radeon, except in Shar Vahl and
Grimling Forest with clip plane out to max.  Those are good zones to
test your graphics card in EQ.

The new Radeon 8500 is much faster than the old GeForce2 MX400 and the
old Radeon 64 DDR.  With the new card, and the new drivers, I have
zero slowdown in any luclin zone with the exception of the palace /
king area in Shar Vahl.  I hunt about 75% of my time in Luclin, and
regularly pass through zones that used to lag me with my old Radeon
(and still lag my old Geforce2 MX400).

I can't speak concerning the other GeForce lines, but I can say the
Radeon 8500 > Geforce2 MX line.  Benchmarks I have seen place it
roughly equivalent to GF 3 ti200.  The only reason I havent put my old
Radeon 64 in my second PC is laziness, and the fact that I dont do DVD
on the other PC so there is no overpowering need to replace the GF2
card.

Cheers
Dan
