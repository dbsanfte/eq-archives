I hit the Warrens with my guild tonight and won the roll for a no-drop
"Kobold Shamans Bag". Weight .6, Capacity 6, Capacity Size Medium, and 10%
weight reduction. It's a nice little bag for a young Monk, especially since
it's free.

I've been  lucky rolling lately... In the past week I've gotten a "Forest
Loop" and a "Giant Grub Digger" from the Forest Giant fort in WW. Last night
I also won a "Cloak of the Forlorn" in the Warrens. I passed the cloak along
to a 20 Mage in my guild, but I'm keeping the Loop :)

Regards,
Matt K
