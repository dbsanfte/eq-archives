Okay, I'm not entirely sure, but the "?r=446282&source=Direct&r=68078"
appears to be a reference tag. What a reference tag is a unique code
for a member that they can tag onto the URL so that if people use the
URL they post to visit the site, then sign up for the service or
whatnot, that member gets credit in either in-game rewards or toward
membership fees. You see them a lot in spam about those silly
web-based games that are mainly just click-generators to earn the guy
running the "game" revenue from banner/pop-up ads.

It may not have been a reference tag, though. I may have jumped the
gun...
