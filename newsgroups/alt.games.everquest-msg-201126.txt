If they nerf KEI, wizards are the ones I'll really feel sorry for.
They'll be unwanted in groups again and the downtime soloing is just
horrendous, imo. I know my 18th lvl wizard twink won't ever get played
again, he was made to solo and I can't handle the boredom of soloing
him w/o KEI. 

I don't buy the raid arguement, for one thing they'll have KEI again
in that environment anyway and for a grouping wizard it's actually a
lot harder to learn agro control with KEI. A wizard w/o KEI doesn't
need agro control at lower lvls, his damage is just too pathetic in a
world where a wurmy sells for 400p and a MoSS or Velium shortblade
sells for under 200. 

Other than that, the KEI nerf wouldn't really bother me. 

Rgds, Frank
