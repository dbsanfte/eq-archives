Ok, one, what's your point? He will be able to use the second one in 20 
minutes to an hour.
Twinking damage output (weapon, haste) and regeneration does add a LOT 
of an advantage to a twink. You can only level as fast as you deal 
damage. At level 1 Jade Mace has no damage cap and does 4-5 times the 
damage of a newbie weapon.
