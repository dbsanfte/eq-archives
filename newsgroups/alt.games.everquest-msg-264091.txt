She just hit 22, has a full set of the songweaver armor, dual 
wields the newbie quest weapon and a giant snake fang, and an 
ivory horn...and 47 plat=) I's rich=)

Any guilds on test that will take me at this level? It was very 
*strange* being the only person in Paludal for 2 hours...got one 
invite to do an LDoN and when they found out I was only 22, and 
not testbuffed they told me not to bother=\
