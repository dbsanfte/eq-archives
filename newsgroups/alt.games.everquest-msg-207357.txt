No, but some of them beat the fuck out of people sometimes.

Sadly, this is not nearly universally true.

Even more sad that some do.  I've known a few of them (parents of
friends I had as a kid).

You're presuming his job is CSR, I'm presuming it isn't.  You don't
see CSR GMs on Test.

Nah, it's just a random confluence of stupidity.  I have little doubt

that 99% of the stupidity was contributed by the players, and I'm
betting that the story has been repeated so thoroughly on Test that
the GM's actions will have achieved their intended purpose with no
players actually the worse for wear (remember it all happened in
less than 20 minutes).
