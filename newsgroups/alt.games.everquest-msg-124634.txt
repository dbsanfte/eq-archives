As an Iksar Warrior at 51, and hating KC to start with, at present I
am soloing in DL against ragers, recluses, windows, etc (anything
blue, except ravishings) after getting a few shaman, cleric or druid
buffs. I find that since I have had good relationships with healers my
level I can usually shout "51 Warr Looking for Healer Partner", and
usually get a reply. Now people are under the impression that the xp
is not as good, but that is a mistake. In fact I got 3 blues soloing
on DL faster than I ever did in KC, and even more when I convinced a
group in KC to go to BW. We killed Gullerback about 6 times and each
of us had a tattered mantle. The only problem in BW is crowd control,
but as long as you have a chanter or a class that can root you are
fine, and the xp there is great (it also helps to know where to pull
from).

I would say you can find a warrior to partner with rather easy.
