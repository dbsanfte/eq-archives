At first, they promised no movelog ever ever ever, other servers where
planned to be launched six months after the first servers.The other servers
would be opened to movelogs, the first servers remaining fresh forever. Of
course, the other servers were never launched, beacause they could hardly
fill the first ones (sure, they found it hard to convince old players to pay
a brand new 60 U.S. Dollars package).

Yes, download the "universal patcher", find him o the technical forums on
