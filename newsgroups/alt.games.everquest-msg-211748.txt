While your example is interesting, it doesn't make the point you want it to.  A
level 55+ warrior gets an ability that will allow him to do amazingly well
tanking ONE mob.  But unless the group you are in is really a raid group, formed
to go after one specific big target, they won't get much use out of that
ability.  Picture if you will an Oasis Orcs group.  Pull orc, kill orc, repeat
repeat repeat, 50 times an hour or more.  Warrior (if warrior had Defensive at
levels low enough to be going after orcs in Oasis) is Supertank on One of those
mobs... and his normal self on the other 49.  Most exp groups follow this basic
model, from level 10 to level 65; kill many many mobs, as many as you can while
minimizing down time.  If you killed one mob every time defensive cycled back up
you'd dramatically increase your time played per level.

Further, in an exp group, Defensive isn't used as often as it pops up, since you
want to hold it in reserve in case something unusual happens.  Just as with LOH
and HT, disciplines go unused for hours on end, because using it to kill one mob
slightly more efficiently matters very little, and sentences you to a period
where the ability isn't available if its actually needed.

Knights are just as good at tanking mobs for the other 95% of their lives, and
are better at getting aggro and keeping aggro, and have some extra added
abilities as well.  Warriors are indeed the tops for taking down those big fat
honking mobs... but most exp groups spend most of their time going after mobs
they can kill smoothly without any heroics; Defensive counts in an exp group for
about as much as LOH or HT... which are abilities the knight classes get from
level one, instead of waiting till 55.

It -is- the tanks' job to keep aggro.  It is the rest of the party's job to help
him do that, but how well he can do it determines how well the DPS classes can
do their jobs, and how well the healers can do their jobs.  If the DPS classes
have to play down 25% lower than their personal best to work with you because
your taunt and hate generation is pathetically low, then they might as well be
only 3/4ths as good as they are.  I can't think of a class that doesn't benefit
from the tank being better at getting and holding aggro.

If the cleric is Chealing a ranger he needs to have his head examined; ranger
gets a fast heal or a HOT, because ranger is going to Jolt soon or die, either
way, that Cheal isn't going to land while the ranger is still being beat on and
it isn't going to be necessary by the time it does.  Often as not I'll happily
ignore the ranger who's accidentally gotten aggro, like a rogue most rangers
know they have something they shouldn't have and don't want, and they have the
tools needed to give it back (after level 51 or 52 that is, at lower levels
rangers aren't really all that much worse as tanks, and lack the "give it back"
tools)

If the "hybrid" is a paladin or shadowknight, then he'll probably need 10% more
healing than you would, you won't see that at all in a fight where you'd need
one Cheal, but if you needed say three then the paladin -might- need four... but
will probably just need three.
