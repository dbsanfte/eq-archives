K my comment wasn't very clear (I likely did say that, because its what I
know to be true)

To clarify, a mobs rampage range is far greater than his melee range.   The
ma has to be next to him (or will be summoned there) - the rampage person
can be a greal deal behind, and would still be hit with rampage.
