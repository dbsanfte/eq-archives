Got a brand new system with all the new toys including SATA drives in Raid.
Well, flashed the bios and poof!  No drives.  Well a new motherboard later
all is well and running great.  Leave that Bios alone if you have SATA
drives, I guess.  They're really fragile.

Anyhoo, anyone have a recommendation for a good little RAM defrag utility?
Someone mentioned it on an EQ board a while ago, but I forgot it already.
