These days? 0 NOK =p

A friend has broadband and two machines. We group together.
My phone bill has plummeted.

Although back when I did pay, it was sometimes over $100 per month.
For a game. Hell, some months close to $200 even.

Man, I've spent a lot of dough on this game...

Hmm, strange, that very same friend of mine who I'm bumming free
broadband from petitioned his name tonight[1]. What a coinkydink!
He didn't get killed while he talked to Drembo[2], though. And
even worse, his wait was like 5 minutes! What's the world coming
to when we don't have to wait hours for CS?

a character called Steroid. As usual, do *not* ask me why.
