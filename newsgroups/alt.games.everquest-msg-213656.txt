They are portals to the Plane of Knowledge (PoK).  If you have the
Planes of Power (PoP) expansion you can click on them with your
mouse and be gated to the Plane of Knowledge (they are two-way,
you can return by clicking on the "stone" in the PoK that you will
be facing when you appear there).

/inspect off
This will prevent you from inspecting other players.  However, you
do need to get a feel for how to use mouselook without inadvertantly
"inspecting" or you will find yourself looting corpses in battle,
which is almost always considered a breach of etiquette and sometimes
will get you or a groupmate killed (by taking you out of action in a
close fight).

AFAIK each must be closed individually.  However, when you are accessing
your "bank", clicking on the banker's "done" button does close all open
containers, so if you do your sorting at the bank you can use that.

Motion stops at 200 skill (the maximum possible skill, can be achieved
at level 39).  Note that your compass stops for several seconds after
a successful Sense Heading, which allows you to get yourself pointed
accurately if you know which way you want to go, which to my mind is
good enough reason to leave the compass up even at very low skill.

No doubt there'll be someone (or several someones) here to answer.  ;)
