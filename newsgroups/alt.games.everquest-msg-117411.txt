I have only played on FV for a couple of weeks, but I have read the FV
message board for months....So far I have only seen references to two
"Uber-Guilds". There seems to be some in-fighting between them, but
nothing like what you see on other servers. With only 1 character per
account you will see very little twinking. The people that do twink
are usually handing down items to themselves when they re-roll a new
character. This means that there isn't a bunch of high level
characters farming items to fuel the twinks.

The low server population makes it very unlikely that you will run
into the types of problems you are describing.

Then you will LOVE!! FV. Just keep in mind that most people there try
to stay in character as much as possible. That doesn't mean that you
have to RP. Just be sure and show respect for those that do. It is an
incredibly fun environment, and everyone I have run into so far has
been fantastic with the exception of 1 beggar. He tried to beg plat
off of me, but he stayed in character the whole time. So even that 1
incident wasn't really that bad.

Don't kill off your characters on other servers. There is no need to
throw away the time and effort invested in them if you decide to move
to FV full-time. They will still be there if you ever change your
mind.
