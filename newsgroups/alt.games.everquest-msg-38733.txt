Scanning the group quickly, we see several arguments over things such as who
VI should focus new content for, where the best place to hunt is, DAoC,
etcetera.

All subjective and a subjective reality exists for each opinion depending
upon the PoV of the individual. One person's "I love Oasis because I can
hook up with kool dewds" will be someone elses "I hate Oasis because of the
kewl doods". While the opinions are exact opposites, they still both contain
the same exact information which makes them useful.

As far as the 'taunt skill' debate being pointless, I say that because while
the facts may be in debate, the resolution isn't. It matters to the people
participating, not to a casual reader scaning the threads.

Side 1 You don't get a gain until after you've been mashing the button until
level 7, at which point you will be 39 points behind someone who put a point
in taunt.

Side 2 You never get a raise w/o putting a point in it.

Nobody in their right mind would go through 6 levels of mashing a button to
save a single skill point. IMO: To a normal person, level 7 without a gain
means put a point in it ASAP. I think everyone in the thread agrees that is
the way to do it no matter which side they are on.
