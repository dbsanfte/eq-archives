Your weapon days are pretty much over. All a weapon is good for is
wacking a near dead MoB instead of wasting the mana on it. By 50 it's
easier to sit and cast a lower end DOT ( that low end DoT will do more
damage and take less time to med for then all the wacking you would
have to do) on the near dead MoB. Pretty much at this point it's all
about the buffs and procs you get from an item in your hand, not how
well you tank, because you haven't been that good a tank since 20.
Seems I won't be holding a weapon again till half way through my epic
when I get the Elaborate Scimitar and that will only be for the 9 wis
and 10mana it will give me. I haven't picked one up since 52 (and that
was on level 1MoBs); I have Testament in one hand and Paw in the
other.
