>1) On the grand scale of things these Jerks did not seem that jerky to me

I wouldn't call them jerks.  I would call them bullies.  That's like two guys
running up to me in the liquor store and grabbing my 12 pack out of my hand
because it was the last one left.  Then saying "hey, I'll give you one of
them".

I disagree.

You are right.  It's totally moot.  But the closest correlation I can come up
with is the beer jumpers saying to me, "well it really isn't YOUR beer til its
paid for".

When I take my neice to the park I tell her she can use the swing when the
other child is done.  I never tell her that because she's bigger or she has 2
friends with her it's ok to knock the other kid off the swing and then agree to
share if the kid cries.  I teach my neice to treat others the way SHE would
want to be treated.

>I generally agree that the folks 
>you met were being somewhat slow and were at least marginally rude,

Agreed.  And they'd have found themselves on my list of "no buffs / no help
ever" list.  They'll never need help from my little warrior, no biggie.  My
high level druid, ranger, cleric and enchanter would remember them too though.
:)  And *smile*.
