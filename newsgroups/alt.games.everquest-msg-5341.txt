My enchanter is level 51 so that's not the problem (shouldn't be, anyway).

I went to the first guy and got the quest (the one who tells you to get the
pen, paper, and ink) with no problem.

I go to Ak'Anon and the pen guy won't talk to me despite being amiable.
Damn.

So I go to Qeynos sewer to do the paper part, and that lady won't talk to me
either.

I didn't bother checking the ink critter.

Any idea what I'm not doing?
