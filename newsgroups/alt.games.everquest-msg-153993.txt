One...I have soloed many characters up, but also have a cleric to 53 *who
obviously didn't get THERE by soloing*, but it's been my experience over
time that the new breed of EQ players think you are there for their
enjoyment, not your own (which would explain their rudeness).  Two...reading
through this thread, notice that the ones who say group for the *experience
of it* say to group with friends or people you know--very valuable
suggestion, as pick-up groups rarely work anymore with lots of e-bayed
characters or just plain old sociopaths who are only in it for themselves.
Three...I soloed a paladin to about 42 or 43 before I got tired of it (now
have soloed a shaman to 50--still going strong and having a blast).  Even
though I NEVER have LFG on (unless in guild situation), I get constant
irritating *want to group; give me HoS; want to partner,etc* messages--duh,
isn't that what the LFG flag is for?  I am always polite about declining,
it's just irritating.  I have been to places with my guild I could never go
solo, but they understand that due to my RL work situation, I can't always
commit to grouping, thus I solo--AND ENJOY IT.  In summary--you decide how
YOU want to play and don't let others ruin it for you.  As long as you are
not griefing other players, and you are having fun, there is absolutely
nothing wrong with whatever you choose to do.....be safe always)!
