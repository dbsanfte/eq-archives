All this talk about reimbursement I think is missing the point. I would
guess 99% of subscibers dont want reimbursement... they just want what they
have already paid for and expect. Just like if my pay TV company decided to
have a days downtime every couple of weeks, I would quickly give them the
boot, and subscibe with someone who can deliver.

These patch stuffups are getting very very old.
