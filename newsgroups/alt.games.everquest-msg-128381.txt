anybody know how to disable those little hotkeys that come on almost 
EVERY keyboard these days?  You know, you hit em and they bring your e-
mail up, or your calculator, or whatever the fuck you DO NOT WANT TO 
OPEN IN THE MIDDLE OF KILLING SOMETHING... ::deep breath::

It happened to me three times in an hour this afternoon, and I want to 
disable them.  Well, either that, or somehow get some sturdy cardboard 
to put over them so I *don't* hit them everytime I move the slideable 
keyboard desk in and out a bit to adjust after hours of sitting in one 
position.
