Oh please! You can debate whether it was a good or a bad Nerf but
anything left in the game for this long was working as intended. SOE
isn't exactly known for letting exploits (common ones that everyone
knows about) stay in the game for years. Trying to argue that it's a
fix not a nerf just clouds the issue with irrelevancies.

The irony is, after leveling my shaman up without KEI and, learning
mana  management in all kinds of situations, it's now irrelevant.
Between Cann 5, KEI, horses, PotG, BST mana buffs, bards, FT items,
etc., mana conservation has become meaningless in almost every
situation.

... umm, it's boring? Which should be the cardinal sin for any game.
