Here's the first HUGE advantage: Balanced groups, 51+, require cleric,
cc, tank, and evac in most locations. Some locations also require a
rogue to get to. Changing maximum group size to 8 would allow those
seven other classes who are currently fighting for 1 or 2 group slots
would immediately have two to three times more opportunities for XP
groups.

Personally, I think nothing would add to the game as much as being
able to link multiple groups together for XP.
