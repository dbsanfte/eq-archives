Playing an Erudite SK is going to be pretty tough.  You just won't have the
HP, AC and strength needed to really deal damage and take some hits. You
have selected a race that is physically weak, but has a high intelligence to
play a class that needs to be physically strong.  SK's do rely on
intelligence for spell casting, which means you will have a larger mana pool
than most, but it will be very difficult for an SK to rely on spellcasting.
The spells you get as an SK can be quite powerful in combination with your
ability to tank, however they will be quite weak if that is your primary
means of protection and damage dealing.

I am not trying to discourage you, just letting you know what you are in
for.  If you really want to make this character work, you will have to put
up with being fairly weak until you can afford some gear that will buff up
your stats and probably learn to play the character a little differently
than most SKs.
