Aoebe had two good nights in Paudel Caverns, and now is heading
to the PoK to drop off items to sell, and requip.

She has two focus items, an earring that says 'mana conservation I'
and a helm that says 'improved healing I'.  She's looking for one or
two more focus items, appropriate for her level of 20, to complement
these two items.

My thoughts for her were to get a focus item that makes casting spells
faster, and another for longer range.  In keeping with the idea she is a
healer, *not* bothering with the damage / affliction etc focus items.

At level 20, I guess she should be looking around for the Level II
focust items, and possible replacements for the two level I items
to level II she has.

Any comments?

Aoebe
