I started a new Barbarian Beastlord named Fleea and put all of my points
into STR and then found out that I should have put some into WIS, so I
deleted him and started him over. After gathering up a few items for him
decided to play him but when I logged him on EQ crashed to desktop.  I tried
again and the same thing happened.  Finally I decided that it might be
because there were conflicting char files, so I deleted the char files and
tried to log him.  It seemed to work and I thought everything was fine, but
when I tried to log him again, the program crashed to destop again.
Everytime I would delete the char files I was able to load the character,
but soon after, the program would crash (when zoning) or lock up and it
would crash completely if I camped him and tried to relog him.  Finally I
decided to just get the stuff off the character, completely delete it and
start over again.  I did this, and even shut down the computer before
recreating the character but once again when I logged him he was fine until
I zoned and EQ crashed to desktop again.  All of my other characters are
working fine.

Any suggestions?
