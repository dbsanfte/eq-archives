The Sub 6s have 2 options.  First you can make 6 in your home city
zone.  That means there are guards nearby.  Second, the solution is to
make 6 and retaliate.  Granted, you won't win, but I've not yet had a /d

higher level chars.  simply by pointing out that we are in a city zone
and there are faction hits on my head.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
