I've taken my cleric to 53rd, and I one thing I've always done from lvl 14
onward is to let the tank (or whomever happens to be tanking the mob) get
down in health just to the point at which my best heal with heal him/her to
full health.  For the most part, your best heal will restore two bubbles of
health for tanks.  At level 14, the "Healing" spell should restore two full
bubs of HP on a warrior.  And I had 150-some WIS at that level, so I was
able to get (I think) a total of 5 or 6 "Healing" spells off with a full
tank of mana.

I always tried my best to make sure the puller (who is also usualy the main
tank) was at full health once he was ready to pull.  The reason is simple:
Shit happens.  There are times when a mob will spawn out of nowhere on your
puller just as he makes a pull.  If your puller happens to be down two bubs
of health at the start of the pull, and then suddenly shit happens, within
15 seconds your puller is running back to camp with one bub of HP remaining.
You as the cleric will immediately cast your best heal spell, and promptly
agro all the mobs onto you, which means YOU die.

Ever since verant made changes to the healing/agro/taunt system, I've
noticed there are two situations where I would agro a mob from healing:

1) Healing a party member at the very beginning of a fight.  (See my example
above.)
2) Healing a party member (at any time) while mobs are charmed/mezzed.  Agro
builds from healing, even when mobs are charmed or mezed.  If you have a
chanter who is mezzing mobs, you better make sure you don't sit down to med
when your group breaks the mez.  The mob is (virtualy) guarenteed to come
after you.

Here's a tip:  The instant you see a spell caster getting beat on...cast
your heal spell.  Spell casters (especialy chanters) go down FAST.  You
won't notice this 'till higher levels, but I have been in groups where a
caster (usualy the chanter) would be dead in 5 seconds at full health.
Superior healing has a casting time of 4.5 seconds.  I literly had half a
second to get a heal spell off.  Heh, not enough time to react.

Here's another tip:  Be a prick and take command of the party.  You'll come
across may tanks who have never played a caster, and don't understand mana.
The best example of this:  Once you join a pick-up group as a cleric,
generaly the very first thing you do is to buff everyone in the group with
your best AC + HP buffs.  (If you have the money to spare, throw symbols on
the tanks.)  Buffing the entire party usual takes an entire tank of mana.
which means, you have to inform the group not to pull.  Tanks don't
understand this.  They figure, "Hey, I'm at full health and just received a
fresh batch of buffs, so I'm rdy to fight."  And they'll go off and pull
something with the cleric at 0 mana.  And they usualy pull a big red mob,
because he figures he's safe since a cleric just joined the group.  Result?
Dead tank, and if this occures in a dungeon at lvl 40+, dead party.

The best rule of thumb I can give you is to heal your tanks at the three
bubble mark.  You should time your spell to go off once they have three bubs
of health remaining.  Your best heal will general heal the other two bubs
back.  In addition, assuming the tank was at full health once the fight
began, the time it took to loose those two bubs of health is probably
suffient enough to keep the agro on him once you cast your heal spell.  That
way, no worries about agro.
