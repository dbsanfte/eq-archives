Although you say "up to the 3rd step", doing the first two is
entirely unneccessary, unless you want to try for the 7th one...
adamantine epaulettes are superior to any of the shawls
as far as AC and Wis are concerned.  To get the
seal, you need merely complete the baking quests, and
in fact its possible to multiquest those, so if there's someone
you know who is a master baker and willing to hunt the
snow griffins with you, you don't actually need to pick
up the skill.  On the other hand, baking is an easy and
cheap skill to get up to 135, and comes in handy.
