But you can! Well, I can, at least, and most well-behaved news readers
should be able to. There are two things very few usenetters seem aware
of these days, the ability to supersede their articles (What you want),
and the ability to cancel them.

When you select Supersede, you'll be presented with your old article
in an editor window, and can change whatever stupid typo or glaring
mistake you managed to include the first time. Then, when you post it,
others will download just the new article, ignoring the old one.

Canceling messages effectively removes them from the news spool (I
can't remember HOW it works, try as I might), so if you accidentally
posted an empty article, no need to follow up with "Oops, I hit Alt-S
instead of Alt-F4, disregard that article".
