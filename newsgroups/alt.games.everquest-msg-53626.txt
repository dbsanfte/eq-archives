High pass is a mess because it's the same jerks from g'fay.  They play
ks jerks on Orc hill working to perfect their craft.  Move on to
Crushbone continuing to do the same, and often times it seems
deliberately starting trains, then at 16 they head off to Highpass and
it's more of the same.  G'fay is so over crowded I realize that some KS
will happen, but orc hill seems the worst for it, which is why if I make
a character born in g'fay, I go level in Butcher then move to
steamfont.  I hate g'fay, it's full of immature jerks for the most
part.
