My wee wife cannot play SoL due to (we think) not enough hard drive space
for swap files and such, as she was getting an error saying 'not enough
memory allocated'.  Purchasing a second HD today.  Want to set up the swap
file to be on the 2nd drive (slave to the first, smaller drive). Will this
set up work for SoL? Other there any other things I should take into
account?
