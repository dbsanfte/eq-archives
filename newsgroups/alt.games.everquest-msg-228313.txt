Hmm seems odd to me, would of thought with a lot of RP'ers a raid would be
the perfect kind of setting for that (depending on the place).  A raid
doesnt always have to be 'go to this zone, track this mob, kill, gate.'

Raiding dungeons and zones that people dont know too well is one of my
favourite things to do in EQ, even a raid of 10-15 people is hugely more
entertaining than 'exp grind farm plats' groups.

My guild is not 'trully' roleplay, we roleplay to a certain extent, and are
also a family type guild. But...we also raid, have just started on halls of
testing, will be doing vindi soon (we pretty much know we can do him, just
gotta find the bish alive), also testing ourselves vs various luclin bosses.

Try a griegs end raid for the servitor, you need griegs key before you can
fight him (or use some fancy aggro technique I guess), and he is easily
doable with two good groups (well, one good group most likely, but would say
two for the first attempt). Praetorian is also an easish fight (depending on
what weapon he is wielding), has high AC which makes him seem like he has
more hp than he really does, and he is just in from SD entrance for easy
location etc.
