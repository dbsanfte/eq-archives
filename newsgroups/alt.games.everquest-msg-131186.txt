*cackle* Actually, that really pisses me off sometimes.  I'm a 27 rogue, 
I grouped with a 35 rogue.  My highest BS of the time was 50.  His were 
around 150 - 200.  I *loathed* that rogue.

*cackle* This is why I don't understand people's reluctance to group 
with wizards. "Uh oh, this one's too mean, cleric, get a CH read--
BOOOOOOOM--okay, nevermind."
