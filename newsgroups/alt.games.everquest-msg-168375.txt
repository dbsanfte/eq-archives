My guild had a similar approach back when we were keying for ST.

Clerics make a difference, beastlords do not.  Its as simple as that,
really.

In our main ST days there were 3 named mobs, the only loot to drop was
primal (rare) and it was a melee place... we had lots of clerics keyed,
shamans, 1 druid, 2 chanters, 1 mage, 1 bard, 2 chanters, zero wizards.. and
the rest all melee.

Druids/Casters just didn't get a look-in, other than the bare minimum needed
to debuff mobs.  I think our order went something like
Clerics
Warriors
Shaman
Melee
Bard

You got it from Tormax/Statue?   These were introduced quite recently (in
the buildup to the revamped ST) when the storyline changed.  Originally they
dropped from firstbrood dragons, and each key was also a very nice neckpiece
(stat-wise), e.g Yelis talisman also had 41% haste.

You only need to do this if you don't have a tomb key (a lil zlandi
loot/quest).  I forget the exact numbers, but back when the lock-pick cap
was set to 200? they made it a 201 requirement to open (ie impossible to
picklock).  Of course since Luclin introduced a lot of skill modifier items,
thats all changed..

When you zone in theres a big doorway infront of you.  Just past this door
is 2 gargs, they will agro a few steps past the doorway and see invis.. you
won't get very far to explore :/
