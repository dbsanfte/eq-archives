    Oh, the death would be great! (GMOTD: Today IS a good day to die!) The
CR would be a pain. You see, the big guy is in a sealed building that (at
present) nobody knows how to open the doors/activate the teleporters to get
into. The person that got in for screenshots was a rogue that got Grav
Fluxed onto the roof, then went down through a hole in the roof for
mid-300's in falling damage. Everything inside is on the starts-KOS Seru
faction (as opposed to the Eye of Seru, Hand of Seru etc. factions which
aren't initially KOS to most folks). Basically, if your friend got summoned
in the body would have to be summoned out.
