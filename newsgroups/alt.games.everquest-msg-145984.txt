We warriors love that game! It puts us in the mood for playing other
games too! Like the one where we replace our taunt hotkey with a /dance
emote hotkey. Man, we laughed for hours doing that. The enchanter kept
getting his head chopped off like a chicken, and it was hilarious. Don't
overdo it though - about 20 deaths on the enc and it becomes a little
boring.
