Many thanks to Richard, Valien, and the others offering advice. Good
stuff and I now have the LAN up again. After reformatting, the GW
machine did not have the Netbuie protocol installed, and the names of
the assigned work groups did not match in case/spelling. Not sure which
of these was causing more pain, but after we matched up the Gateway to
the IBM and restarted, we had the network back. 

Now if I could just get into Luclin (or ANY server) I'd be all set.
