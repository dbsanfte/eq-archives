Nah, it was more of an attempt to make Cadfael laugh. He rezzed me
once, so I don't think he hates *me*... ;)

(If you do stuff other than pharm non stop in an 'I am an ass' manner
and sell for exorbitant prices and charge 100pp for ports, you're not
a pharmer dr00d. Dr00ds are the bane of my existence so I am perfectly
entitled to hate them.)
