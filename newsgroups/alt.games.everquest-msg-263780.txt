I wonder whether or not the D2 HC mindset will be of any benefit at all in 
helping a player avoid death in EQ2?  Or are we comparing apples and

You've played both, Bob, what do you think?  Am I going to have to 
completely wipe my mind of *everything* related to D2 to successfully play 
EQ2, or are there some things I can take with me?
