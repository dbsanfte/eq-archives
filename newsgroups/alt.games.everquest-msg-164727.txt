Bards don't need KEI.  Necros don't need KEI.  For that matter, Druids
and Shamans don't <need> KEI to solo or group effectively either, tho
you'd think they did from how they behave nowadays.  If SOE really
wanted to promote grouping they'd put a 30 minute duration cap on any
buff from the moment you and the caster were not grouped (LD? tfb).
