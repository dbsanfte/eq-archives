  Well, sometimes they do run out of mana, or at least low on it.  The fact
that a common tactic against Vox is to have enchanters and bards suck away
all her mana pretty well proves that fact.  Mobs will also run out of mana
in normal fights, in some instances.  This is how my group killed the
shardwurm matriarch in the Great Divide once... she's a cleric, and
throughout the entire fight, she kept casting her DD spell... she S. Healed
herself once, and also C. Healed herself once.  I think by the time we got
her low on health again, though, she was pretty much tapped out because when
she got down to about 1/4 health, she stopped casting.

  NPCs do seem to have huge mana pools, but I don't think the disparity
between NPC mana pool and PC mana pool is as big as the disparity between
NPC HP and PC HP.

  I can't really say this change is "unfair", since overall we have been on
the receiving end of some nice "buffs" ourselves recently with the addition
of new items, and the retroactive improvement of several old items.  The
Planes of Power will raise the bar even higher.  They say they made the
changes to be more "consistent"... consistent with what, I don't know.  But
it does make sense that higher level mobs will cast higher level spells.

  However, for the sake of "consistency", I think that mobs shouldn't always
have their full class repitoire of spells available to them.  Not every
level 49 wizard I've encountered has Ice Comet, and that should be the case
with wizard mobs too.  Same with other dropped/researched spells.
