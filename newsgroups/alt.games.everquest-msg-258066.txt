Actually, no, I was unbelievably lucky.  We were OTM to do shawl walk with 
someone, and the druid I was botting just happened to stop by the succor 
point and see SF up, and apparently uncamped.  So camp zinny, log warrior, 
druid picks up Medb in PoK, Circle of Iceclad, Succor, and amazingly 
-still- up and uncamped, even like, 5 minutes later!  Three quick nukes 
later, I had my map piece.  And headed back to the general to wait another 
20 minutes for everyone to get there. :)

But many times, I'm in a longish solo fight, and I notice by the blinking 
that CNQ is about to fade.  If I've successfully Truncheon o' DOOOOMed the 
mob, I have fair-to-middling odds of managing to rebuff myself between the 
mob's hits without being interrupted.  So... how much is each rebuffing 
attempt impacting my melee?

I'm the pocket chanter warrior, I can haste, slow, and even tash!  My 
kingdom for a mezz and a stun though.  :)
