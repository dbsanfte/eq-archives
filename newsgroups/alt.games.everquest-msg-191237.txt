	At 14 in Unrest you would be meat for everything unless you get
in a good group (or seriously tweeked).

	I would suggest CB is a much lower level area than Unrest.  At 14
you would be in the middle of the high end levels (goes up to about 20
there) and be able to group and fight with not too much difficulty.
The throne room (TR) would be your best bet but it is almost always
camped.

Wayne...
