I'm having trouble seeing Familiars and players in other forms, they all
appear as bald, unarmoured, humans. I still hear the correct sounds for the
creature they are meant to appear as, I can hear the beating of wings or the
howl of a bear as a shaman is injured falling.
Any ideas what I have or have not done to cause this (used to work fine) I
get this on both my PC's one running with settings at a minimum and some
models off the other up high with all models on.
