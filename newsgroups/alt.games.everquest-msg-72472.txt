I can not get the wincolor commands to work for me to change the
transparency of a window. I have all three Expansions installed.

Specifically, I want to decrease  the transparency of the CHAT window.

The way that I interpret the command to do this ( which is obviously
wrong, or I would not be posting here) Anyway:

/wincolor CHAT trans 0 ENTER.......... This does not work. 0 (Zero) is
supposed to be NO transparency.

I tried this: 

/wincolor CHAT trans 0 reset ENTER...........This does not work
either.

I have tried both of the above using lower case CHAT.....No luck

Comments?
