That'd be a lot.  tool back by about a month to when the dupe bug was
first discovered.  But I do hope SOE limits to roll back to just the
dupers because the last time there was roll back, a lot of people who
weren't aware of the beta NPC bug got hurt, and that beta npc fiasco
was only up for an hour whilew the current duping issue was on for a
month.  If SOE was to roll back every single player that has touched
the bag, and expand to every single player who touched the tainted
money or bags we'd have the entire population rolled back.

Imagine the howl of protest when 1 month worth of xping, 1 month of
gears, 1 month of complicated quests, etc all wiped because most of
them didn't know.
