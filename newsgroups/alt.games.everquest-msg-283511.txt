Since it's oversea, online ordering is probably the only way.  I don't
know what the rules in UK are but generally companiws only send
product to address listed with credit card owner.

Worse case, you get the key but you can pass it to your pal.

As an alternative you can find a friend in USA to pick up a copy of
Titanium locally and air mail them (probably under couple dollars
mailing)
