Method 1....
Collect as many rusty weapons, hunting bows, arrows, etc. that drop in
Blackburrow as you can.  When you can barely move, head back to Qeynos,
sell, and come back for more.  Wear whatever charisma gear you have when you
sell, to squeeze every last bit of copper out of your efforts.  Captain
Rohand and the merchants inside the Lion's Mane and Volleen's Bakery tend to
give me the best prices in town.

Method 2....
Hunt bears in Everfrost, QHills and WKarana.  Hope one of them drops a High
Quality bear pelt.  Auction off the pelt to players for 20-30pp (price
depends on which server you're on).  Watch your back for Holly in QH and the
Treant in WK...I'm sure by now you know that they don't like bear hunters.

Method 3....
If you have a magic weapon, hunt willowisps in QHills (and in Erud's
Crossing if you're in a good group).  Be prepared to run or die if a group
of them gang up on you.  Sell greater lightstones to players for anywhere
from 5-8 pp each (depends on supply and demand).
