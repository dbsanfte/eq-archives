I'm not certain, mostly because I haven't watched for it, but I don't
think buff procs go off on misses the way weapon procs do.  If I'm
right about that, and if, in turn, mobs get weapon procs on their
misses (another thing I don't know), then the rules are the same for
PCs and NPCs, with mob intrinsic procs and PC/pet buff procs being
equivalent.  It's an interesting question anyway.
