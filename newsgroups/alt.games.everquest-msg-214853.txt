I see that I was wrong. The terms do specify that you aren't allowed to 
disclose the password. Per the EULA.

That said. I have to accept the agreement each time I play. Should I 
choose to stop playing. I can decline the agreement, and am now free 
from its encumberances, though I lose my right to play, which presumably 
suits the seller just fine. It is an End USER License Agreement... when 
I cease to be a user, and elect not to agree with the terms I cease to 
be bound by them.

SOE would have a really tough case establishing that I am bound to an 
EULA that I expressly declined last time I saw.

PS The copy protection boilerplate etc in most EULAs is meaningless 
largely because of that. But that doesn't mean you can copy software, 
because the copyright is binding law separate from whether or not you 
agreed to it in the EULA or not.
