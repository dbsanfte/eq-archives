    There's been a few indications in Lucy that PoMis is being updated. This
comes after a Skyshrine update that was a very, very long time coming. I
believe that it'll be fixed someday, but it's on the same priority level as
Skyshrine and PoM. If there's nothing else that needs doing, work on these.

    I think the real shame is that players don't get to see the event. From
what the one guild that completed it said, it was an incredibly detailed
storyline and encounter script - two things that are very lacking in the
rest of Luclin.
