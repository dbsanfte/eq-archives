Another good point for Rogues is that they have no mana, so aren't blowing
med time looting.

I'd like to see Sony implement a good autosplit.  It would work like this:

1. For coin, give everyone their share of each kind of coin.  Distribute any
leftovers randomly.  Example: 4 person group loots 6p 3g.  Everyone gets 1p,
2 picked at random get another 1p, 3 picked at random get another 1g.

2. For dropable items, distribute randomly.  For LORE items, skip people who
already have one, of course.  Everyone in the group gets a message saying
who got the item, and giving a link to the item.

3. For no-drop items, when anyone tries to loot the item, they get a
confirmation box, and everyone in the group gets a message with a link to
the item, and a list of all players in the group who match the
race/class/diety requirements for the item.  The list is in random order
(this is meant to replace manual rolling).  The group can use this
information to decide who gets the item.

This system would mean that dropable class specific items would go to people
not of that class.  I don't see that as a problem.  If, say, a 5k plat
Wizard spell drops and I'm the only Wizard in the group, I don't see why it
should automatically go to me.  The other group members would find it
useful, too--they could sell it in the Bazaar and use that 5k to buy
something they can use.  Before the Bazaar, when it was a real pain in the
ass to convert items for other classes into something you could use, it made
sense to give preference in looting to people who could and would use the
thing, but with the Bazaar, everyone can use almost every expensive dropable
item.
