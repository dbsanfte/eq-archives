That's not the issue. We're not talking about paying money for EQ, which 
we all do, and very few of us have a problem with. The problem is 
bringing in issues of real-world wealth into Norrath. Basically, all 
characters start the same, and the only differencing factors should be 
player ability and player commitment. A character shouldn't be made 
superior to another one because the player can plow more real life 
dollars into it.

Of course, there are games (such as Project Entropia) where bringing in 
real-world money *is* part of the gameplay, but in the case of EQ, it's 
both against the letter and the spirit of the law.
