Wish I had a horse, in RL or in EQ.  But actually I didn't jump to
conclusions about your statements...just the fact that a lot of power
players are on a different scale than folks like me, and the WAR
soloer I suspect.  Fun is in playing, not necessarily achieving super
status.

And that position is hardly a high horse one...just a different one
than the main stream EQ uber leveler.

I actually wasn't poking fun at anyone.

Sorry you were offended.
