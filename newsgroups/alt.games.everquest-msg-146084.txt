    The last tests run at EQTraders seemed to indicate it didn't stack. That
would explain why the mod was bumped up, if it's true - +5% is useless on
the gloves if owning a 100 pp Geerlock gives you the same advantage.

    You've managed to scoop the Creator's hammer, the Gauntlets of Dark
Embers, a Geerlock and the belt off what's-his-Praesertium? Nice collection!
So far my tradeskill mods are limited to the Gauntlets, the Shears off Shei,
and a pile of Geerlocks. But even just those make a huge difference - my
lowest effective tradeskill score is now 194 (Fletching or JC, with
Geerlock), something I never imagined I'd achieve. And making things is fun!
