Congrats!

My Dwarf Paladin has been living in Kurn's Tower for the past week or
more, collecting mega-bone chips to increase Cabilis faction.  In about
9-11 days in the basement of Kurn's, I've seen the Jester 3 times,
and each time he dropped only a Fine Steel Sword.  Sigh.

But on the other hand, just last night in Kurn's on one of the Burynai
Excavators, I got an ultra-rare drop -- the Solist's Icy Wand.
Eqprices.com says anywhere from 8000-22000pp for it...

I know that feeling.  :-)
