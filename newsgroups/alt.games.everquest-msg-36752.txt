Yet, you posted one that had no real content, just a "Why?".  That's the
second time you've done that recently ( see the thread about Languages ).
Short, but, not silent, especially when you know the "Why?" would generate
replies.  Your actions are totally opposite of your stated "beliefs" ( see
above with the not having to make 500 posts a day ).

I don't recall anyone saying this was the only thing they were interested
in.  You aren't one to twist others' words, in fact, you have a strong
tendency to point out when people -do- twist words / misquote / make shit
up, so I'm puzzled where you got this notion, so it looks like something to
divert the attention to another subject - that being, people who play 20
hours a day and are only interested in changes in the game that others have
noticed but they haven't.  That's not the subject at hand, the current
discussion is about what people are noticing changing in the world they play
in, and furthermore, why they would discuss these changes.

There are many things to be interested in in this game, and the vast range
of topics in the NG support this.  Seeing one that hasn't been beaten to
death ( yet ) and can educate people on the world and how it's changing is
productive in that people are learning.

> >"Was this a trick question?"
> No, it was a logical comment.

"Why?" in response to his post isn't logical.  If you want to get picky and
say that it was only in reponse to "Might as well start the thread now" (
what you quoted ), then it makes even less sense.  It makes -total- sense to
start a thread on what you are noticing changing in the world as they start
changing.  Starting the thread after all the changes are made would be
illogical.

> Have you considered that regardless of
> what you see today, things WILL be different four months for now?

Yes - and that supports his post.  Thing -will- be different, and following
them as the changes evolve is -interesting- to some people.  The NG is here
to share information and discuss the game.  People discuss what is
interesting to them.  If it doesn't interest someone, then they have no need
to reply to the thread.  As one of the more knowledgable people who post in
this newsgroup said "We don't actually <have> to make five hundred posts a
day to this newsgroup... honest."

With most games, it normally isn't productive because you aren't already
playing them.  In the case of an -expansion- to a game you are playing,
where the environment starts changing four months in advance, it is
productive.
