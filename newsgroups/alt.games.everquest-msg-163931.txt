I'm going to hijack this thread and go off on a wild and totally puerile
tangent.

How -would- they implement lavatories, anyway?

"You have to take a dump."

At this point, you'd have to visit some special room in an inn and click on
a toilet.  If you're not in a city, you'd have to find an out of the way
place.  And if anyone stepped in it before it disappeared, it'd proc some
sort of CHA debuff on them.  The smell, you see.  

Rangers and druids, while outdoors, would be able to get rid of it by
burying it.  Vah Shir would have that ability everywhere.

If you ignored that message, after a while you'd start getting:

"Your colon is about to explode."

Keep ignoring it, and you eventually get:

"You soil your armor!"

At which point, you'd get a really big CHA debuff.  Unless you were an Ogre
or Troll.  Or a drunken Dwarf.  They just don't care about that.
