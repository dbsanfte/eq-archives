Interesting theory, but doesn't stand a chance to be believed for the
following reasons:

1/ Let's suppose for a moment one kid hiding a bomb approached a group of
soldiers. The kid would trigger the bomb himself, thus blowing himself to
pieces. I know that some regard this hypothesis as possible; I don't.
Because I know what is a kid, and I have enough judgment to distinguish
between an hollywood movie and real life. This is a poor propanganda trick
which fools only fools.

2/ I know some americans consider foreign countries as barbarians, but
between seeing Vietnam as an underdevelopped country and trying to
assimilate vietnamese parents as animals sending their kids to the butchery,
there is a step that no one in the civilized world is going to accept. This
is simply, not, believable. Find something else which could be plausible, at
least.

3/ And third, I cannot believe americans soldiers so stupids as to be blown
to pieces twice. It seems to me that one the first group has been hit, he
could place a call to others to avoid kids carrying backpacks, no? Are you
not insulting your countrymen intelligence by suggesting they don't
distinguish a north vietnamese soldier and a kid going alone to picnic with
a backpack? 8;)

There is a war america will never win, that of intelligence.
