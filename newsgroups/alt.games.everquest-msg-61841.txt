I enjoy the language aspects of the game. I always try to speak to my
own (elvish) people in Elvish or Elder Elvish. It's pretty funny when 2
High Elves that are Awful in Elder Elvish try to have a conversation in
that language as neither one seems to get much of what the other is
saying.

It's something from which it's so hard to be free.
But none of the tears that we cry in sorrow or rage
Can make any difference, or turn back the page.
