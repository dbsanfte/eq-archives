The Guardians occasionally drop Pristine Armor.  The Vortex Weaver's Veil, 
off a bat in the basement, is an excellent chanter item.  There's a few 
other nameds that drop interesting things.

The ones right by the entrance are a good source for cracked staves, which 
can sell for a plat a piece, pretty good money at a low level.  Although 
encumbrance becomes an issue. :)
