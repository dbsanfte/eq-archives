This is probably where we disagree.  My opinion is that since True Newbies
have no risk associated with travel, it's no big deal anyway.  You fall off
the boat and die ... so what?  You spawn back in you home zone with all of
you stuff.  Run through Kith at night by mistake .. .so what?  You spawn
back in your home zone with all your stuff.

By the time you hit 11, you're in a zone where you'll be hunting for a
little while ... no need for travel with concerns about death.  By the time
you finished there, you're close to 20 ... and since travel would have never
been an issue to this point, you run from place to place thinking "This is
boring".

That's the problem, though ... no one can.  I can't remember the last time
I've seen a true, honest to goodness, never played the game before newbie.
I've seen a blue million lvl 1 twinks, though.

Yeah, I know.  It just bothers me when I'm in a little group working over a
zone and some two-boxing PLer comes in and runs us out by taking all the
spawns.  Ruins my night.

I'd probably feel differently about it if I two boxed, though.  Tried it one
time ... the charm wore off in about 20 minutes.
