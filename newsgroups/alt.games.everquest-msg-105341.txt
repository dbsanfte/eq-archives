Sure.
If they have decent gear they will not be hit for that much, assuming the
twink is a skilled player that is churning thru tons of blues rather than
being an idiot and trying to take on reds and getting his ass beat.

For me, I am talking about just armor and a decent weapon, no regen other
than natural.

But you still have to get that mana back once it is gone. Most low level mobs
don't take a ton of mana to kill. If it takes 50 mana to kill a mob it doesn't matter
If you have 100 mana or 200 mana. Either you kill 2 in a row or 4 in a row.
You STILL have to med to get the mana back.

A warrior with better armor and better weapons can kill MORE faster with the
SAME hitpoints as naked. Bigger weapon and mobs die faster. Better armor
and the warrior gets hit less, so spends less down time sitting and healing.
If he is really twinked with cash he just buys backpacks full of bandages
and runs around at 50% all the time or better constantly killing and bandaging.

Now if you could add an item to your caster that boosts damage output
(focus item) per mana spent and say some kind of armor for the
pet(3 of the 4 int casters get pets) now you are talking.
