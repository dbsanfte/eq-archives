I don't believe he's at all a rare spawn, I can clear the fort to make him
pop at least in one location everytime(usually get 2-3 spawns per clear). I
do clear the camps up the road near the iksar lord and the other gobbie
camps also closer to the giant for because he can pop there also.  I've
killed him so much, it's gotten to the point now that I can almost tell
when/where he's gonna pop! ;)
