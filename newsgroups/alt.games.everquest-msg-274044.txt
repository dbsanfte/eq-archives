"Common meaning" vs. "context".
For example, the word "vegetable has a *common meaning* of a type of plant 
we eat.
But if someone says, "The poor guy in Ward B is a vegetable," we all know he 
means the guy is somehow mentally challenged. Ah the beauty and yeah, 
sometimes frustration, heh, with the English language.
No word is an island :)
