The Jaggedpine Forest zone is open on Test now. Zone-ins are from 
Surefall and Blackburrow. The zone in from Surefall takes you close 
to an outpost with NPCs on the Qeynos and/or Surefall factions. 
There is a banker, druid trainer, merchants, guards. Mob levels 
look to be 30s and 40s, green to dark blue to my 53 druid.

Dunno if this is old news but I thought I'd mention it. Someone there
said that it was going to Legends first. It is a very pretty zone.
