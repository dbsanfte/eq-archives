Push AC and strength.   I wouldn't worry about your choices though as
strength items are easy to come by.  Make sure you stamina is over 100 with
items and then devote you item choices to Str.    You will also need to
start looking for resist gear (save magic, disease, fire, cold) for those
times you need them too.   AC will be the top stat to build.  I don't worry
so much with dex and agi because I can usually get buffs in those when I
need the skill-ups
