Cool, where do you live in real life? I'm asking because I 
now want to come up to your front door and knock on it then ask

"Would you accept $2.30 for a ride to the mall?"

Because, after all, nothing is wrong with it.

I think its ok to offer money for services in channels, but putting
people on the spot is just as ill mannered as it is in real life. If
both parties were REALLY role playing, they'd get that.
