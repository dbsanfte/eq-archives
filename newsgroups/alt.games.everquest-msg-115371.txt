I have a 53 Necro that I have mostly retired (still use him for
research for my new baby Necro and other young Necros in the game
though).  He is an Erudin and I have used the Paineel elevator
hundreds of times.  About a week or 2 ago I could not get the
elevator to work at all.  I tried camping and destroying my key to
get another one neither thing helped.  I am wondering if the "U" got
rerouted some how.   I looked through options and the .ini file to
see if I could verify what key is set for the unlock command but
nothing is listed.  Is it kept on my PC at all?  If not any
recommendations as to how to fix it?  I did the petition thing but
GM had no clue what to do at all.  I wouldn't really bother with it
but I have an urge to get a Rogue going and will need the "U" key to
work for him.  Thank you for any help.
