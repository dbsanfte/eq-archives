}Is it normal for someone to try out a new weapon skill here?

So I'm assuming, since you knew that the problem was his low 2hb skill, 
and exactly how much he'd trained it, that you discussed it with him.  
Personally, I'd never train a skill without saying something like "Anyone 
mind if I work on my * skill?"  That would have been your cue to say "Yes! 
I mind!" Or at least later to say, "I really don't think the skill 
training is working out, can you switch back to your main weapons?"

Did any of that happen?  Or did you just decide it bugged you later on?

It's pretty simple.  If he asked, and the group said "uh, whatever" or was 
silent, then he wasn't rude.  If he didn't ask, and/or got all upset when 
you suggested he stop, then that -was- rude.  If it bugged you and you 
never said anything, it's certainly not his fault.
