I've made some good money at the bandit camps in paludal, tho at 25 it may 
be a little hard to solo there.  Any tradeskill items usually sell pretty 
good in the bazaar on test, probably better than on prod servers.  Silks, 
pelts, words and pages are a good choice for farming if you want to go that 
route.
