I believe I can help you here :)

No game card needed either

Next time you log in, when it asks you to subscribe select "global collect".
Then they will give the the bank account details etc to EFT funds to. They
will then re-activate your account for 7 days. All you have to do is then
transfer funds to Global Collect Australia to pay for your EQ account.
