SERVER PROBLEMS

The recent server problems have been explained. Hopefully things will be
functioning normally as soon as possible.

Recently we have been troubleshooting an issue with one of our ISP's. This
troubleshooting is ongoing. At this time, by keeping this ISP in the mix, we
feel that we can no longer provide the quality of service that EverQuest
players have come to expect. We have therefore temporarily turned down our
connection to this ISP and re-routed this traffic to our other ISP's. Best
efforts are being made to resolve this issue. Once we are convinced the
solution has been found we will bring this ISP back online. We apologize for
any inconvenience this has caused and will provide an update to the
community once the situation is resolved.
