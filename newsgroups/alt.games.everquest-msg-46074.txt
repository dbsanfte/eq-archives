Yes, the low levels and sparseness of people makes this feel almost like
EQ did in the "early" days. Back when groups of folks less than level 10
would form up to travel cross-continent.

Of course, it was only some of the feel. In fact the game has changed,
and mostly for the better.

My two days of play on FV have been quite nice so far. I've mostly just
soloed, running around doing quests, a little roleplay interaction with
other characters, and generally taking it easy while trying to get a
sense of what the new rules are gonna do to the game.

There'll be the usually flood at the opening of the server, of course,
but I'm expecting that the munchkin population will end up somewhat less
than on the regular servers. The new rules are something of a pain in
the butt compared to the regular rules for munchkinizing the game. Not
the social interaction bits, but the obstacles to overcome with the new
additions to faction. They aren't severe, but they're more than on the
regular servers. Why would a munchkin put up with it for long when they
can go back to the regular servers and not have these restrictions at
all.

Personally I was expecting even greater isolation between the races than
what we're seeing now (and hoping for that, too.) I was disappointed
that the MOBs seem to be able to speak to and understand everyone
regardless of their language. I was also surprised that the mushy 9-way
alignment system was used rather than a more divisive 3-way division
(Good, neutral, evil) that the earlier posts in the developer's forum
seemed to suggest.

Personally I think the hurdles add interest to the game for the
roleplayer.

Something that I'm interested to see is how the forced alignment changes
work. If my neutral druid spends too much time killing gnolls and orcs
is he gonna have to knock down Misty Storyswapper or hunt farmers a few
times to stay "neutral"?

There's still a whole lot to the effects of these rules on gameplay that
we haven't even gotten to the levels we'll need to be to see the
effects.

I'm hopeful that we'll see at least a lower overall population of
munchkins than on regular servers, and that where they do crop up the
roleplayers feel emboldened to irritate them through aggressively and
tenaciously roleplaying.
