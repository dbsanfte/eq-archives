 Ok...here i am in Dreadlands in a group being my shaman self..when i see a
/ooc WTB sow pots !!!..since im still kind of new at making these i had like 3
on me (3 sow pots not stacks). I send him a tell..."Hey there i have 3 i can
sell ya"..reply "Ok where are you at" i give hm a loc...about 5 mins passes and
this guy comes up to me ready for the trade...i place the 3 sow pots in his
window and he places 270pp and about 300gold in the window...i was think
whoa!!! Rich boy needed some sow pots i guess..he checks trade i do as
well.....about 10 mins later a party memeber tells me.."Hey...what
happened..that guy is pissed"...i say"What do you mean?" "look at what what hes
sayin"...i did not notice but for the past 5 mins or so he had been hollerin at
me in shouts/oocs...Oogaboga is a thief...Oogaboga is a scammer...the list goes
on and on..im like whoa hold the phone what did i do....i front him in "/ooc
hey what the hell did i do?"...he sats blah blah you ripped me off....a long
story short i guess he thought i was trading 3 stacks of pots...so i was kinda
floored by this since well i told him i only had 3 and all....i ask him to just
kindly take back his comments he made about me in /ooc shouts back in the same
way he made them and i would correct this goof up......and he wouldnt.....then
he went to say he was going to contact my guild leader and gms....so i said
screw it here take your money and keep the pots.....so i would like to know how
others would deal with a person like this?<sorry so long and drawn out>
