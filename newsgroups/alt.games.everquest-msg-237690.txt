Doubtful, as it has worked properly in the past.  What has been 
happening, ever since they allowed windowed mode with eq, is that the 
EULA screen comes up, but does not control the mouse.  If you click once 
on that screen, it makes EQ the current task with control of the mouse.  
Then you can move the mouse to the accept button, and click that.  If you 
don't click the mouse, it remains tied to your desktop most likely.  It 
should really be a very trivial thing to fix, EQ is the only application 
I have seen that regularly has the problem.
