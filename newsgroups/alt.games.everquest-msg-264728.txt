According to a dev post, this is not the case. When you zone, you are 
put in a random instance as are the people in your group, therefore it 
is entirely possible that you and group members will be separated. I 
sure as hell hope it changes to the CoH way before launch, but according 
to the devs, it's not that way now. 

Maybe a tester can shed some light if this is accurate or not?
