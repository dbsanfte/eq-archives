Why?  I can't get KEI without paying first.  Why are ports different?  I
don't do it that often and have no desire to build "repoire" (did you mean
rapport?).

I don't port much, but I need the plat when I do.

My worst experience was a guy who asked for a port over /taxi.  Said he
would pay 100p for a trip from Nexus to Dawnshroud, but it had to be fast.
I was just about to log, but 100p is a lot of money for me, so I zipped to
Nexus, found him, invited him, and started the cast for Dawnshroud ASAP.
When we got there he said he used split to give me 100p, but I never
received it.  I've forgotten his name, didn't notice his guild, just called
him a bastard and logged out.
