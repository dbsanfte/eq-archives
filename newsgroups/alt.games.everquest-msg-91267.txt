Not really a troll in my opinion (gnome faorite char) - just humor!! Get
over it!! Servers downtime comes and goes and so does our available play
time. I think EQ players play on the "bleeding edge" and also have our
investment in someone elses hand - and are genuinely concerned. So all I was
saying in a humorous way is where is the Legends and I had no information
about emergency patches apart from the recent postings - that appeared after
my original post..

So (hopefully) see you in game - I still am trying to log and see these
legends

> Yes thank you for posing as a troll.
