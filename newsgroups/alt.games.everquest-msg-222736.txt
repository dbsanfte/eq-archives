I doubt it is as weird as Stormhammer. I am currently farming EK and getting
10pp per spider silk, 8pp per medium quality cat pelt and 15pp per high
quality calt pelt. In my 2 hour session last night I got 190 silks, 30 HQ,
12 MQ and 27 Ruins. They were all sold within half an hour of putting up
shop in the bazaar.

Of course the cost to buy anything on this server is ridiculous, but I came
here to make money to take back to Tunare, so that is not an issue.
