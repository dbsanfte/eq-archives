Hmmm, as I recall the arguments about melee binding (used to be a
real sore-point, prior to soulbinders) the supposed reason was that
because casters were weak in hp/ac they would die more often and so
deserved a leg-up on recovery from death.  If this was the reason
they did it originally it's incredibly stupid.  First, because
casters die less often than melees (Gate = escape, no Gate = death).
And Second, because it completely invalidates the old "Bind Afinity
encourages socialization and grouping" bullshit line they stuck to
for so long, because the casters could and did bind near the action,
not in the city zones where melees needed to be bound.

Personally I think the whole Bind Affinity approach was stupid from
the start.  There should have been Soul Binders (or Bindstones, or
whatever) in the game from day one, and casters should have been
severely restricted in where they could use Bind Affinity, and all
of those locations should have been valid melee Bind points.  But
then I've played almost exclusively melees, so what do I know.  I
mean, if they really wanted to encourage grouping they should've
just put in a 50% exp penalty for any level 20 or higher character
whose accumulated solo exp exceeded their accumulated group exp.
