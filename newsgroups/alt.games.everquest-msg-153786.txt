Yea, I think there are certain "bot" combos that should be avoided.  I "bot"
war & cleric, wiz & cleric, or wiz & war, all are fairly safe combos.  In a
group where crowd control is an issue, "botting" with a chanter is spooky at
best.

Now if someone is able to effectively "bot" a bard & chanter, I will be
impressed.
