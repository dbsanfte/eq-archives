Well, that's obviously the case now.  And it would be stupid to change it.  
But if they're hoping the *majority* of problems can be solved by 
referring people to the *in-game* knowledge base, I foresee difficulties.  
Especially since, if they think that's solving the *majority* of problems, 
they may feel cavalier about eliminating or scaling back other options.

Which would be retarded.  Let's hope they're not retarded.  It's a faint 
hope, but hey.
