Kind of like MSRP I know.

They are also less than my friend on an original server reports. Let's see
what I can remember paying lately: Stein of Moggok 100pp, Savant's cap 30pp,
Robe of the Keeper 40pp, +4int necklace (gold saphire?) 45pp.

Low end cheap stuff I know. But I'm low end and cheap. So what do these
items go for on some of the older servers?
