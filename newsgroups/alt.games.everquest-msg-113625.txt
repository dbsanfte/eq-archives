I have had much different experiences. Usually Its ooc or auc or tell . Will
pay 10pp for port.
And if I respond to a Looking for port can donate I <usually> get alot more
put in trade window.

I also do the same when a buffer is offering buffs for free but looking for
donations as compared to someone auctioning buffs for a set price. I usually
pay way more than average if no set price is made. Some folk go the minimum
some folk go the max.
