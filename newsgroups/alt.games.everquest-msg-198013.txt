*Gasp!*  Maybe the the 30 to 50 odd petitions, /bug reports, and
emails I fired off to Sony that time I stuck under the world for 3
days got noticed!  I can picture the dev meeting that lead to this one
"Guys, we've got to fix this problem before that crazy, obsessive
compulsive beastlord decided to take on evil eyes and go LD again..."
 
   Though I wonder if the new fix helps even if you are mezzed the
whole time you are under...
