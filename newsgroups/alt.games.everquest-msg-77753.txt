If you are travelling along and, as you say, looking for p/u groups,
scratch Sebilis right off your list. Your odds of getting picked up as a
tank are pretty poor. (Not that it *can't* happen, but much worse odds
than if you're a chanter or cleric.) But that's not the bad news. Once
you zone in to look for a group, if you don't find one you are STUCK
there and may as well camp unless there's a porter (or TL capable wizzy
even better) to get you out. The entrance is one way, and you'll never
make it to the exit alive on your own.
