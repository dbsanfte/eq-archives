My question is, can I still use it in an open inventory slot? If not, well
then that quest was all for naught. What a pain too. I died twice getting
the items for this staff, and the ability to use it on the run and NOT have
it equiped in ANY of my melee slots just ruled......

So if this is a complete Nerf, then we Wizzys have a choice +10 int (Staff
of the Wheel) or Elemental Resistance and debuff ability...

How much of a mana hit is 10Int?
