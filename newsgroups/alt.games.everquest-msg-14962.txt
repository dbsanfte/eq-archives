No one's arguing that there's such a thing as 100% secure computer.  There
isn't.

What I and others are arguing is that HACKING OF EQ ACCOUNTS JUST DOESN'T
HAPPEN VERY OFTEN.  It happens so rarely to be considered virtually
non-existent.

No one has ever come up with any evidence that an EQ account has ever been
truly hacked in any way similar to what you're suggesting.  On the other
hand, everyone who I've seen answer regarding stolen items has said that it
seems the victim had given their account information to SOMEONE.  The small
percentage that did not probably has their password written down near or on
their computer.

Hacking is possible.  It just doesn't happen that often.
