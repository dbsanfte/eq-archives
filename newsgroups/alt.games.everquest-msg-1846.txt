Personally, I started out with very noble aspirations of giving SoWs to
anyone who asked, but (and this will surprise nobody who has the spell in
their book) that fell by  the wayside very quickly indeed.  It wasn't so
much the way people asked, I actually think that "SoW plz" is partly due to
the fact that people get fed up with asking, but the real problem was all
too frequent gimp who would get his "lupine aura" and then bugger off into
the distance without so much as a "thankyou".  Even "thnkz" would have been
something.

Incidentally, for those who are REALLY fed up with doleing out SoWs can I
suggest the Spirit of Cheetah alternative.  You'd be amazed how many rude
beggars have run off at unusually high speed, blisfully unaware of the fact
that they've got sixty seconds, by which time they'll hopefully be engaged
:-)  Yes, I know it's evil but so are NSync and Verant haven't banned them
yet ;-)
