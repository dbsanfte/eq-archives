I make my scout App III skill, and they required

Sepia Ink (made from Sepia dye, made with isoloid ?)
Tin Spike
Lead Ornament.

So you need 1tin, 1 lead and 1 general metal to make the reagant that
make the sepia dye which makes the ink.

For scrolls,  I think the spike/ornament is replaces with quill and
paper, made from wood and roots respectively.

IIRC there's a trading channel - maybe you can put out a request ?
