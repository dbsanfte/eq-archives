Heh I said this EXACT phrase in and earlier post on druids role in a group.
There will be very few times that a group says We REALLY need a DRUID! But
there are also very few times they will say "we don't need a druid".

Druids are usually called upon for level 50+groups that don't have a wiz
(therefore they need evac) or don't have a shaman (therefore they need
backup heals). If you don't have a wiz or shaman and you only have one slot
left.... you NEED a druid :) If you have two... you need a wiz and shaman :)
