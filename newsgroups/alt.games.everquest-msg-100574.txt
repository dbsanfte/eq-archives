You could also say it went 30% up. Was the starting price low? Maybe.
Does a larger server cost a lot? Pretty much. Does bandwith cost a
lot. Definitely. But hey, 30% is nearly one third. Not that I have
aproblem with 3$, but that's a very substantial increase in
percentage. Wonder what future brings. Btw, some whining is just
talking. Don't jump the bandwagon so fast everytime.
