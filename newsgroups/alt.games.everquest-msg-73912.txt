No arguments here (I've never even *tried* to sell a bow - when
someone wants/needs one, I just make one that's likely to skill me up
and give it to them) - and it's entirely possible that the OP will
find someone who will give him a deal or gift. It's a near-certainty
that he can find someone who will sell them at the going rate.

If it were me, I'd make it a point to pick up a Shiny Brass Shield as
soon as possible, so he can bash invulnerable targets, but that's
making assumptions about his weapon/melee style choices, and moving
away from his initial question. Given his level, bank account, likely
location, innate transportation limitations and stated interest, a set
of banded seems like an easy-to-achieve and affordable solution.
