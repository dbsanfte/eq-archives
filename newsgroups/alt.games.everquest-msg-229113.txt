When the game was young, and even today on the newer servers, you
could level a new character in a number of places: early levelling in
Befallen,
Najena, or Kurn's Tower, perhaps Unrest, then mid-twenties in Netherbian
Lair, late twenties on up in several places. Today, however, on the more
mature servers with populations dominated by 60+ level characters, there
are relatively few new characters being started, and the pressure is to get
them "into the game" - up to the levels where everyone else is - as fast
as possible. This leads to everyone concentrating in a few places, and a
single well-travelled path to glory for most people.

  Newbie levelling can be done in most any town, as they all have high
ZEM's, though Qeynos seems to stand out. After level 4 or 5 the place
to go is Crushbone: this has the same ZEM as Paludal Caverns and
orcs from level 3 into the teens. Fight around the yard until level 10 or
so, then you'll be able to gain experience with the Throne Room camp.
Some players prefer to go straight to 16 here, but I think it's better to go
only to 14, especially for classes that get new spells at that level, and
move to Unrest for two levels; it will go faster, and can generally be
soloed.

  At level 16 EVERYONE goes to PC. 16 is the last of those blink-and-
you'll-miss-it levels; with a fast chain pulling group at B1 or B2, I've
seen it go by in as little as ten minutes. As things slow down in the
low twenties, there is the temptation to find somewhere else with
higher level mobs to keep the experience flowing faster, but most
people start to prefer the relative safety of fighting below their level
at this point: groups will often have level 24 or 25 members, making
things touchy for the teenagers who want to see 16 flash by.

  Here things get tight for evil races: the next place on the path is HHK,
but you have to get through the good guys guarding the entrance.
One can easily go to around level 30 fighting the goblins in the basement
if you're a member of a good or neutral race, but the main problem is there
just aren't enough of them to go around for two groups; one good group
can leave slim pickings, and usually there is a long waiting list to join
it.
Once upon a time the overflow would go to NL or Marus Seru, but in the
LDoN era they can whisk through the late twenties in LDoN missions.
However, I've seen few people LFG at these leevels and even fewer
parties LFM. Maybe they're just efficient at getting together, but I
suspect a lot of people are toughing it out solo where they can.

  The path splits more clearly into two alternatives at level 28-30: DSP and
OT. There still seem to be late twenties groups at the north end of DSP
some days, though the pressure is on to get to level 30 so that you can
survive at the GE or ME camps. Again due to LDoN, these places are not
permacamped as they once were. In OT, the ramp to SF seems to still
have groups half the time, and on weekends two, one either north or
south of the main group. There would be faster experience elsewhere,
in higher ZEM indoor zones like Kaesora, but people like these places
mostly because mobs can be clearly single pulled and they offer
plenty of space to kite for control if there is no mezzer.

  After level 37, the paths used to reunite in the Dreadlands, and my
druid did this stretch with some frustration, waiting for groups to
open up or for enough people to be LFG to form my own group.
The main camps here are clustered around Karnor's: the North Wall,
Northeast Ruins, Southeast Ruins. These days, however, the place
is like a ghost town as everyone flocks to LDoN.

  At level 46 the path ends: congratulations, you've arrived! You gan go
to the planes and play with the big boys! But there are still too many
places where the groups are full, and not enough people are LFG
to form a new one. And all too often whn I use the LFG tool no one
wants a non-LDoN. No one has time for open-ended levelling...

  Well, live with it. Time for my next Mistmoore Catacombs mission...
