I've seen people get turned away from groups because they were rangers. 
Twinked.

I've seen *highly* twinked idiots get turned down cold and shouted down in
humiliation in a zone.

I've seen people get turned away from groups for all kinds of reasons.  Do
you want to eliminate all of those reasons?  Put in an IQ test to sign up
for EQ, remove all classes from the game except for warriors, clerics,
enchanters, monks, and wizards, give everyone the exact same equipment
(*my* level 60 monk is not the same as *your* level 60 monk, and ya know,
nobody calls you a twink at 60...).
