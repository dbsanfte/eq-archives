I've had that same problem in the past. I found a couple of things
that help:

1. Avoid massive twinkage aside from AC/HP. Getting beaten on for a
longer period of time helps defense and gives you more opportunites to
improve melee skills per kill. Getting killed doesn't help anything
pre-level 10.

2. Stick to weapons with as low a delay as possible, regardless of the
damage (within reason, of course).

3. As I understand it, DEX items help. I have no supporting evidence
of this though.

4. Avoid being powerleveled. It's a quick fix that hurts you in the
end. Do it right if you want to enjoy acceptible stats at appropriate
levels.

Worst case, your skills slowly catch up as you level. You will begin
to spend more time in each level the higher you go. This will give you
more opportunities for skill-ups per level.
