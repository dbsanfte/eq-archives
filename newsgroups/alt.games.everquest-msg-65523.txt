I have been being told Ill see all sorts of problems cos of my kit...as
yet none of the predicted hassles have occured....now I may be heading for
a fall or it may be they overestimate their recommendations and minimums
for safety. I am currently leaning towards the latter though I wont be
surprised with the former....history of stated gaming requirements is
definitely on my side in my experience....hey I wasnt supposed to be able
to run counterstrike on my machine well....but it does.
