	Get the boots.  =)

	The best suggestion I can give you is to find a guild.

	My main character is a 46th level Gnome Warrior on the Brell
Serilis server.  I belong to a small guild called Wings of Honor.  The
guild was founded sometime in the Fall of 1999, and has been hunting
together as friends ever since.  Some of us have left for extended breaks,
but we always come back.

	I can't imagine how I would have made it to 46th without my guild.
So much of my levelling was done with guildmates.  There are a lot of
places in EQ that are "Bring your own group," and if you have a good guild,
you can go to these places where you wouldn't otherwise find a group.

	If you're in a guild and you're still looking for a group, you
might need to find another guild.

	AB
