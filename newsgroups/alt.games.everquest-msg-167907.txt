Thurg drops occur in Kael Drakkel, easily raided by people in their
low 50s and done as an XP camp by people in their mid-50s.

Skyshrine drops occur in The Halls of Testing in the Temple of
Veeshan, an area that generally requires at least three groups of 58+
types to raid. Worse, people actually need to know what they're doing
in HoT.

If your Thurg faction is less than ally, you're probably still scowlin
is Skyshrine.
