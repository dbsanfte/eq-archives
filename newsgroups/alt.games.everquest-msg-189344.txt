You'll have lots of choices if you only install the original game, and only
a few more choices if you install EVERY expansion, so go ahead & do them
all.

Yup, you'll be overwhelmed even with the original game, and you'll likely
find it a bit frustrating.  With any luck you'll find you don't like the
game, before you become addicted. :p
