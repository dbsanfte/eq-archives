Does anyone in here use a Voodoo 3000 with Everquest?  I guy at work was
telling me he was having his machine lock up when he was "being attacked
heavily".  No other time.  Other games run fine.  Old video ran fine.  I
know nothing about Everquest, but I thought that I would post the question
here to see if anyone knows of this issue.  He said he thinks it's more of a
sound issue rather than a video issue, but the lock ups didn't happen until
the video upgrade.  He has a HP Pavilion or something.  Don't have the
specifics.  All he did tell me was the modem and sound were onboard, using
the same irq.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Regards
Phil
