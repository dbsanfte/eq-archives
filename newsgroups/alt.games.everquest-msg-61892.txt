Large bronze drops off the Ogre guards in Najena down on the second
floor near the officer's area. I've even picked up the breastplate
there, but I think that was off the top guard. At level 16 you're
obviously not soloing your way in there, and I don't even know if you
could manage it with a group. But, you might try going and hoping to get
lucky and see if anyone's raiding there. (zone is usually empty) and
auctioning to buy some. You might get lucky.
