The person getting the ring turns in a note and is given commend of
several troops of dwarven soilders. (In reality, you don't use these
troops at all, but keep them herded up near Thurgadin. The more that
survive, the better the loot you get.) Once it starts, yes, all the
regular mobs in the zone despawn. Enless lines of Giant spearmen and
bowmen line up a ways from Thurg, and wave after wave of increasingly
powerful giants show up and begin rushing towards Thurgadin. You have to
kill every last one. If even one gets through to zone into Thurg, they
go in and kill everything in Thurgadin and the war is lost. If you kill
them all, the turnin person gets the ring and there's some other good
loot to go around as well. Just went in on one yesterday, and it's a
blast to see. You can also amass some massive good dorf and CoV faction
during this event.  Of course, you can also very easily die in under
three seconds if you get in the wrong place at the wrong time.
