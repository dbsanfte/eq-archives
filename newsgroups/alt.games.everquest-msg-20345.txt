I had a similar problem a couple weeks back.

I renamed the eqmain.dll file to eqmain.old and let the file patcher
replace it. This reset the video to the default 640x480, and I was
able to change it in-game with no further problems.

If that doesn't fix it, you can always delete the "new" eqmain.dll and
restore the eqmain.old file you renamed.

Cheers
