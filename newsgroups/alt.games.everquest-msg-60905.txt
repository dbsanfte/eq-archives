That is completely incorrect.  Catata of Replenishment does 11 mana
per tick with or without a lute.  Catata of Replenishment is the same
mana regeneration as C2.  The only thing the lute does is take the
regen from 12hp/tick to 28hp/tick.  A lute has no effect on mana
regeneration.

This is almost alwasy a result of poor tactics.  The correct way to
travel with a bard is to elect someone OTHER THAN THE BARD as the
leader.  Everyone, including the bard, take off SOW or wolfform and
/follow the leader.  The only person in any danger of going out of
range is the leader, and he needs to be paying attention anyway.  I've
finally got my entire guild trained, and then we bring in a new class
of recruits, I really ought to hotkey the bard travel lecture.  
Hopefully the rumors of a long-lasting bard travel song in Luclin are
true, I get tired of watching people splat.  (People traveling with
other bards, I haven't lost anyone in several months.)
