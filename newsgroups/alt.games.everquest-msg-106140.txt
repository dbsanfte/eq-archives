If it doesn't effect gameplay at all then why do you use it? Obviously
it has some benefit otherwise it would not have been written or no
one would have downloaded and installed it.

Verant doesn't like it simply because it makes it easier to run other
'hack' or 'script' or 'macro' programs while EQ is running. Quite simply giving
an advantage to the users that others do not have.
