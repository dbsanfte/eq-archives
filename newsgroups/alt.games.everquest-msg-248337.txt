When you target another player in CoH and select the "info" command from the
"action" menu on the targeting window, their description is given (along
with all their powers).

This gives an amusing role playing opportunity--come up with some story and
put it there explaining how your character came over from EQ.  My Controller
has a whitish face, pointy ears, and looks kind of like a Dark Elf, and even
has the same hair style as my EQ Dark Elf Wizard, so my description says now
that I was a Wizard in another dimension, ever questing for more power, when
in accident researching the great library of Neriak transported me from my
nameless dimension to Paragon City, where I discovered that it was a
mutation that allowed me to manipulate mana there, and here it gave me
mental powers to dominate and control minds instead.

(I was on The Nameless in EQ, which is why I'm from a nameless dimension).

If I'd know this before creating the character, I would have made him magic
instead of mutant, for a better fit.
