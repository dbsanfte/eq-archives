Actually, I think it is a little simpler than this.

Target something, kill it. Your target is then cleared. Get whacked by
something when you have no target and your target is set to the whacker. If
you are on auto-attack and the whacker is in front of you, you'll whack on
it till it dies.

The bad news is when either you are not on auto attack, you get attacked
from behind, or the critter your attacking decides to run away and leave you
to his friends.
