As far as entering FP as an Iksar i do it all the time.  As of this
writing I have never been seen while invis.  That goes for both corrupt
guards as well as the "Sirs" that occupy N. Freeport.  However, beware
if you go into the necro/Sk guild...while they wont sell to you at
best-I know of at least one DE Vendor that will flat out try to kill
you. :)
