	If a scientist wants to call something a "theory", he'd better have a
bucketload of proof.

	What you call a "theory" is what a scientist would call a hypothesis: a
working guess.  What a scientist calls a theory is what you would call a fact.
Scientists are pretty dodgy about the word "fact".

|They don't change from their faith-based beliefs either.

	Science is not based on faith.  It is based on results.
