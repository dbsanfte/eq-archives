I said that to my wife last night ... it seems like everyone I've met is
around my age.  The proof is in the /ooc conversation.  Things referenced in
an aside can tell a lot about a player.

As I thought about it, I wasn't sure how that has come to be ... if it was
by design, if the $10/month is a factor, or what.  But it does seem like
there are a lot of gamers in EQ who are in their 30's as opposed to their
teens.

Or UT, or D2, or SC .... the list goes on and on.  That's why I normally
wait a little while after a game comes out to hop on it.  Let the landscape
form a bit, lurk a ng to see what the issues are (I had no idea that
'twinking' was such a big deal, for example), then decide try it or not.
For example, I had a feeling that I wouldn't really fit into the D2 crowd,
but it was a sharp enough game that I figured I'd try it anyway.  One or two
online experiences with D2 was all it took to help me realize that, for me,
it's a really great single player game.  I'm okay with that.
