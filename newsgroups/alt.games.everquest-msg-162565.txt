First, thank you for a comprehensive, thoughtful reply. I posted my
self-reply before seeing yours, so feel free to disregard. ;-)

This is what interests me more than anything else, since the interaction
with other players is what drives me to these games and I prefer the company
of others who share a common passion.

I guess it was too much to expect that the cost of Legends would keep out
the childish.

Sounds like wise advise. Based on what you've said the cost is pretty
questionable, but it sure *looked* promising. Thanks for an honest
appraisal.

DISAPPOINTING! I would have thought this one of the major selling points.

Yep, that's another big plus. On my 2nd or 3rd night back some idiot stood
in front of my character for about 20 minutes, chasing me and asking if
"she" could be my girlfriend. I've been assuming that there would be less of
this stuff on Legends.

> I hope this helps ..

Very much so. One last thing: do you have any additional information on the
other servers? Is Stormhammer unique in the respects you've outlined or is
it pretty much the same story all over? Is there a roleplaying Legends
server?

Thanks again, appreciate the candid input. Hope to see you someday... ;-)
