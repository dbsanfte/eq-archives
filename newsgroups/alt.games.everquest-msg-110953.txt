a couple of observations.

1) if he really was a twink monk then he would have no trouble still soloing
reds at that level. You throw a cof , a fungi tunic , some hp ac gear , and
a couple of good weapons on a monk and they will solo nonstop till there
40s. In other words he was probably lying in the first place.

2)If he was not lying than what he was doing was offering to slow his exp
gain way down while raising yours for the price of a bit of company.
