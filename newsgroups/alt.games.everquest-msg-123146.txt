*********************
Main is a shammy. While farming, I summon dogdog to kill greenies.

Clueless_Newbie says "Hail Jabober"
Clueless_Newbie says "Can I have SOW"
I say "He's AFK"

...
Time passes
...

Clueless_Newbie says "When will he be back?"
***************************

I had nothing to come close to that.
