    There are a few things you as a druid can do with a GM character, unless
they've changed it in the past year. One of these is damage shield the GM.
Once had a griefer dr00d nearly end a GM quest when he kept dropping his
biggest damage shield on whatever the questor was supposed to kill. The GM
had to stop fighting back to even give the attackers a chance. Trust me - a
big druid damage shield will put a major hurt on any melee morons who go to
attack the main character.
