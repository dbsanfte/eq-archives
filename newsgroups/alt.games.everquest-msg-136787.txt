Now tell us again how you weren't saying it was for only 5 years.
Tell us how the hassle would just last for 5 more years but the use 
of the clause could go on longer.

More bullshit. It is not for a maximum of five years, the maximum is 
infinity, and you didn't know or mention the ability to renew until I 
pointed it out to you.

Why tell me, it's you who didn't have a fucking clue until I corrected 
you.

It's politics at it's ugliest and most cowardly. The Federal gov't is not 
against the implementation same sex marriages, but they don't have the 
cojones to come out of the closet. As an aside, it's situations like this 
which demonstrate why the asshole prick Trudeau's repatriation of the 
constitution was the worst thing which ever happened to this country. 
What it did was take away the supremacy of parliament and hand the 
reigns of power to_make_ laws and socially engineer to unelected judges.

>So you believe that invoking Section 33 for the purpose of removing
>one of the rights in sections 2 and 7-15 does not create a precedent
>weakening our rights?

No I don't, and I don't primarily because the ability to use the 
notwithstanding clause is a ' right ' in itself. All out rights were
established, some subject to and others not, under the umbrella
of possible suspension through use of the notwithstanding clause. 
So I can't see how any of the rights subject to notwithstanding could 
be diminished when they weren't absolute in the first place. In a
general sense it's like I lent you my hamster, and at some point took 
it back. You might feel you lost your right to the enjoyment of my 
hamster, but it wasn't yours in the first place.

>makes it easier for future governments to remove more rights?

No. There's no cumulative, open the door, or slippery slope
involved. The governments right now have their maximum
power with respect to this. Now you might have a point in the 
fact that a successful Alberta veto [ I'm just using this because 
it's easier to type ], { although the explanation wasn't }, might 
make other governments more inclined to use the veto for
different reasons, most likely to blackmail Ottawa, but I really
haven't thought it through well enough to be confident one way
or another.

Of course I think they were wrong. You seem to believe the Ontario 
Supreme says jump and the rest of country is supposed to say, " How
high ? ".  You really should get away from the center of the universe 
and see how few people worship at your feet. It was a _provincial_
court decision and means jack 3000 miles west.

I was right on the money, and we'll leave it to others to decide.

I see absolutely no reason why it's definition can't be altered either. 
BUT, there has to be more justification for the change other than
two guys want to make their mamma's proud. Any social change of
this magnitude DEMANDS public participation, consultation and 
consensus. It is abhorrent to any believer in democracy to think 
unelected judges can alter the construct of a society in such a 
subjective and arbitrary manner.

Which I have. Of course my response had nothing to do with what
you are babbling about above. In case you forgot you used the
word PROVE, to which I replied of course I can't prove the results
prior to the event. Your creative snippage is truly a thing to behold.


>Ah, but does that make it right to add that stress on top of everyday

Simple for you, but do you deny the change would or could be 
stressful to others ? As much as you'd like to think the issue of 
same sex marriages only concerns you and your ilk [ I always 
wanted to work that in ], only affects you, and only you should 
have a say, it doesn't work that way.

You seem to feel that

>would you rather solve that problem, at least?

Tell me how BC and Alberta can get out of this effin country and I'll
start working on it tomorrow.

Whoever the granter of the privilege decides. It's their ball and 
they should be able to throw it to anyone they choose.

I think everyone should be treated the same, ' married ' or ' single '
with the state conferring no benefits to either based upon their status. 
Marriage should be about as meaningless as most married couples
appear to treat it.
