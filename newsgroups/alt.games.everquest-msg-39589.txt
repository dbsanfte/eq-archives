Hehe, just remember not to use it unless your SURE nothing will attack you. Had to
run from Freeport to Qeynos to help a newbie friend, first i die in Kith (didnt
know about the nighttime problems, at least i learned to stay out of it) then i
barely survive the bandits in EK, and then stupid me manage to get slain by Sir
Morgan because i used my DE form for the Ultravision
