It's not so much that, as the general rottenness and betrayal of killing 
something that considers you their friend. Check /con for reference.

Strangely enough, I always thought that using the most out of animals 
that are in fact non-trivial to kill with standard Native American 
technology would stem from simple practical considerations rather than 
any half-baked philosophy white people would take unto themselves to 
attribute to them. Stampeding bison right off a cliff does seem to 
appeal more to the practical side than the philosophical side of a 
hunting people, at any rate.

Oh my god, a roleplaying flamewar. How 1999. :-P
