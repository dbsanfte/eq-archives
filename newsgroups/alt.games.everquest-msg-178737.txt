Best classes to mix between groups and solo'ing is a Bard IMHO.

That said, I HIGHLY recommend AGAINST having a Bard as your first toon.
Pro's and cons of the others mentioned here:

Necroes: Great solo class. Underappreciated in groups, but, as such, often
will have a tough time finding groups. Raids love them, but you're liable to
find yourself type cast by folks that think that the only think you add is
"twitching" (giving mana to other casters).
Druids: Also a great solo class, and easily the most popular class in the
game - largely for that reason. Druids come and go in terms of their group
usefulness. I like them for flexibility, but they are very, very often a 2nd
or 3rd option for some other need that you have.
Beastlords: Essentially a Shaman with an attitude. Great solo class, and
way, way under appreciated in raid and group situations. They are behind
shammies in most spell aquisitions, and will never be a shammies match in
the things that a shammy does best, but they do pretty well at a number of
shammy sorts of things while adding a bit more on the offensive side of the
house.

Not mentioned that I've seen:
Bard: Can be the fastest leveler in the game, and is wildly flexible. Is,
however, very, very hard to play "right" by comparison to most classes.
Shammy: Healing powers with some offense too. Late in life, they are
primarily appreciated for their more passive powers (slows, buffs, etc.),
but they are still a mean class.

JMHO.
