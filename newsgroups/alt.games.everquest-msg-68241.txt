Well i have a tnt 16 meg agp, p2 400 and 384 meg ram. I use the same
drivers as you do with the geforce though and here is what I found
with all new models enabled, social animations set to on, and LOW
textures (best performance change overall was that low textures.. all
the models runs fine)

21.83
23.11 

both seemed to lag me more often when using transparent inventory
(that started with the Luclin dx 8 engine "upgrade")  with a box open
and even when viewing the spell book (mose very slow and stuttering..
switch back to full view and its not than the 

12.41 did.

So whether verant says so or not, the 12.41 is still working the best
for me. I'm never lagged with the mouse in spell book view with them
as i was with 21.83 and 23.11. This is VERY irritating so I had no
choice but to go back. Its just too hard to mem spells.

Before the dx8 engine "upgrade" I never had this mouse slowdown or
graphics lag with transparent inventory or the spellbook. I don't know
what they did but it screwed me up.
