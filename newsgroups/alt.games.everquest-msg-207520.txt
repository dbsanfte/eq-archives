Malo/Torpor won't matter there except for shaman's mana regen but I
have to agree with Martin that you'll probably get owned at some
point. It's a crap shoot but I have seen a lvl 60 puller eat 3 or 4
600+ harmtouches on the pull. Not sure if he coulda pulled fewer in
south, he was a pretty suicidal puller <g>. 

My best advice would be to bring along a rezzer, that way if you screw
up on a pull it won't be a big deal. 

Tigir's is also your friend there, nothing like droping an AoE slow on
a 3 or 4 mob pull.
