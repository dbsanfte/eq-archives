On EMarr at least, getting the pipe from Chardok is very difficult, as 
the mob is perma camped, unless, of course, you are willing to pay the 
person camping it what he is charging for them.  Not sure about any of 
the other mobs needed for it really.  The rogue epic, has those silly 
notes that need to be PPed, which can take a while I am told.
