>> Got a bit of a problem. im currently playing everquest but at the same
time im hearing some good stories about Ultima online. im tempted to switch.
anyone got any good arguements for me not to? <<

Just bear this in mind...

Ultima is about to release another "version" (I think the old school UO will
still be there) based on the Unreal (?) engine. They are calling it Ultima
X: Odyssey. While it is the tenth in the series of the "normal" Ultima
universe, this is designed to be a multiplayer instead of single player.
