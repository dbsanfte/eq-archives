At level 11 they have a week to figure out how. That is the
difference. Level 1- 5 they have half and hour, which to a newbie
seems pretty rude. I remember as a newbie erud necro before paineel, I
died trying to get to the erud training area in tox. I was level 3. I
was flat broke and struggling and did not even have the money for the
locate corpse spell yet. When I finally managed to get the spell by
scrounging and killing a couple things, it had been over a half hour
and the corpse was gone. The corpse had enough money and gear to make
it hurt.  Due to how much tox sucked as a newb area for a necro, I
made a char somewhere else.

Its a heck of lot better to have bad things happen to you as a newbie
at 11 than it is at one or three.
