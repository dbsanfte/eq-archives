It doesn't work for the monster summon pets that Mages get.
But I am pretty sure it will work with Necro pets as well. Yes
give them any crap loot armor that you can.

I have a Necro friend that keeps a sewing kit, patterns and
several stacks of ruined pelts to give his pet some patchwork
armor. I think he gives it just tunic, legs, and arms.

Hmm don't think so.

It generally only works with pets that can at least equip weapons,
its a good bet they can equip armor as well.
