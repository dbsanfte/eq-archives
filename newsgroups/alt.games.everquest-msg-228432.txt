an article from the Montreal Gazette.

Smart soldiers decided to flee the Rings battle
JAMIE PORTMAN

It's the greatest and most spectacular battle in the Lord of the Rings
trilogy.

But filmmakers faced one surprising challenge - how to keep the
computer-generated soldiers from fleeing the battlefield.

Director Peter Jackson had laid down his requirements for the Battle of
Pelennor Fields - the climactic engagement in The Return of the King in
which the heroic defenders of Middle-Earth face the overwhelming might of
Sauron and his armies of Darkness. Jackson wanted the computer-generated
antagonists to have absolute authenticity on the big screen and to be
indistinguishable from the real actors.

Computer wizards responded brilliantly, not only with Sauron's swarming
armies but with such additional lethal adversaries as the massive winged
Fell Beasts and the giant elephant-like Mumakil. The next step was to
ensure that the confrontation itself have detail and authenticity.

"I want battles like nothing anyone has ever seen on screen," Jackson
said. I want every soldier fighting for himself - you have to come up with
something."

Special effects designer Richard Taylor says this led to the writing of a
"massive" principal code for the battle to give more than 200,000
digitized soldiers and some 6,000 horses distinctiveness and
individuality.

"So to create these individual agents, there was a code that was
especially written and developed," Taylor says, adding that it was like
being involved in a living work of science fiction.

"It was the fact that you could get a computer to think for itself, that
you could get 200,000 agents within the computer to think for themselves.

"So each of these computerized soldiers is assessing the environment
around them, drawing on a repertoire of military moves that have been
taught them through motion capture - determining how they will combat the
enemy, step over the terrain, deal with obstacles in front of them through
their own intelligence - and there's 200,000 of them doing that."

Basically, all the necessary information for decision-making was fed into
this network of computers without determining for them whether they would
win or lose.

But this attempt to ensure that they acted spontaneously almost sabotaged
the the battleground sequences.

"For the first two years, the biggest problem we had was soldiers fleeing
the field of battle," Taylor said.

"We could not make their computers stupid enough to not run away."

So some extra computer tinkering was required to ensure that the trilogy's
climactic battle worked the way Jackson wanted.
