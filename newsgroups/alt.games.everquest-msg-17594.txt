I've been playing now for about a couple of weeks and I have to say, I'm
impressed! It's surprising how much unsolicitted help I've been receiving
from higher level characters.

I've never once begged or asked for anything from another player yet people
keep trying to give me stuff left right and centre! The only things I've
managed to do myself for other players are low level heals when I see
characters that are damaged + giving away items like basic weapons when I
run into weaponless characters, that kind of thing.

Other players have even insisted when I've tried to politely turn down their
offers of help / items / money etc!

Just posting here to say "Thanks" to all of you players who give advice or
directions,  or help out in any way to us newbies. I hope to be able to
return the favour in future!
