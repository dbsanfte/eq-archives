Um... whats the point of being in the group if your going to be expected 
to shell out bazaar prices to keep the stuff the group earns?

If the group is going to sell them to a merchant, then what harm is 
there in giving them to him for the merchant price (NOT the bazaar price).

And if the group has people who would take the trouble to bazaar auction 
them...then just roll on them like any other valuable drop.
