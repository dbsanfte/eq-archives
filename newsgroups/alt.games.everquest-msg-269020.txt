Inane does not mean foolish, it means "lacking significance, meaning, or 
point, what you said did lack this, it also was stupid in the definition 
that it lacked reason and was a careless thing to post, you should have 
known you would have been flamed for posting something like that. There may 
be nothing inane about pride of any type mentioned in this thread but your 
pointing out that guild pride read as gay pride to you was in fact inane. 
It simply brought nothing to the posting and just didnt need to be stated, 
in the future please wait 10 seconds before posting something and think 
about what you are about to post.
