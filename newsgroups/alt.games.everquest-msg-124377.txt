Huh. I'm perplexed.  I've whacked gnolls all weekend inside Black
Burrow and have a complete outfit of ruined chain, and left a lot of
pieces on corpses for others to loot.  I don't think the ones on the
top level dropped, but once you get down below the rest area, every
third one seemed to be dropping.

HTH

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
