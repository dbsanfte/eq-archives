No, its a full evac. Also this is only an interzone to safe point evac
and not a port. 

No, its not strange if you think about WHY. EVERY change they made
recently was not for the class itself but ALL LOWER PEOPLE. Necros and
sks can summon corpse of people 35 and below, druids can evac at 18
and wizards lower, people don't leave a corpse at 10 and below and
appear in all their gear. ALL of these things are for one purpose:

They are to get lower level people out and into dungeons and
exploring, instead of having career twinks in south karana, lake
rathe, lake of ill omen and the commons orc camps.

The difference between this and the 57 one is ONLY that the 57 one
takes less mana from the caster and from the group (the group cost
only comes if they people in the group have that much mana.. its not
needed for the spell to work) BOTH of them take less mana than the old
57 only succor took (I think) They had to make the 57 one take less
mana (and possibly be a faster cast.. I forget) so you'd still want to
get the 57 one.

This is GREAT. I JUST turned 56 and was feeling a need to rush to 57
for succor, then this happened ;) I have the 57 succor in the bank but
feel no big need to rush now. It will be easier for me to get groups
at 56 since I can interzone evac.

Yes, MEM IT. Its great for groups in some dangrous places instead of
the port succors which take you to a ring far away. For yourself just
use egress, which ALSO has lowered mana. Er.. is egress 52? I forget.
Really this is very nice since lower level druids won't even have the
self succor so this group one is great at 18.

Since it reloads the zone neither is that hot for travel now but some
still have conveniences. For example, if you are going to tenebrous
mountains through katta and coming from twilight sea, once zoned into
katta succor takes you right to the zone of tenebrous (otherwise you'd
have a long and winding run and the no lev run up that narrow ramp
that I hate)

I often get lost or turned around in hollowshade or shadweavers on the
way to shar vahl. These are LONG runs from paludral through these
zones to shar vahl (the kitty city) Succor takes you right near the
zone to shar vahl so is nice there also.

The most recent benefit is that coupled with this they made the kedge
keep "safe" point safer. I guess they moved it by the zone in
probably. So they must figure this will get more lower level people to
group in kedge also (though I guess its pretty high midlevel or above)
