I'm 15 (16 in December) and have been playing since december/January 2001.
My highest character is a level 9, almost 10, Wizard--but that's for a
reason. About a couple months (or three, or more, can't remember) I had five
characters going (A ranger (9) a mage (8) a Monk (5) a Shaman (4) and a
necromancer (2)) After losing corpses PERMANENTLY on my ranger and monk, I
foolishly deleted all my characters (!) and started my aforementioned
wizard. Then I stopped playing for a couple months, and recently started
playing more often. Since then, I've added a ranger (almost at 8,) a
necromancer (5) and an enchanter (4). Although I frequently add more
characters, I get bored after a while. I'm probably going to play my Wizard
more after he joins his guild (found one, but I'm having trouble setting up
an initiation time.) so I can keep up. Heh. Anyway, just because I'm 15
doesn't mean I'm stupid. I like to think I'm smart, but my foot often
vacations in my mouth. :)
