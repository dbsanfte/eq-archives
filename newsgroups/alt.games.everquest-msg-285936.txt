Your shift key is stuck.  And you're incorrect.  

The only price announcement there has been said:
"We want to give you some important information regarding your Station Access
subscription. Effective April 2, 2007, the new monthly subscription rate will
be US$29.99 per month (not including applicable taxes)."

I just checked the station store, and the billing options are:
  1-month ......... $14.99  (plus tax, if applicable)
  3-month ......... $41.97  (plus tax, if applicable)
  6-month ......... $77.94  (plus tax, if applicable)
  12-month ......... $143.88  (plus tax, if applicable)
  24-month ......... $199.95  (plus tax, if applicable)

Station Access Subscription
Effective April 2, 2007, the monthly subscription rate will be $29.99 USD
(plus tax and value-added taxes, as applicable.)
  1 month ......... $24.99  (plus tax, if applicable)

The price of EQ is not changing anytime soon.  If you think otherwise, please
provide a link to the source.
