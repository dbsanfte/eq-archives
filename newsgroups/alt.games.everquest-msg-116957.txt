Then something really weird is going on.  I've died before at night, logged
out, woke up the next morning, and gotten a rez... I've seen several corpses
where the rez timer was still at 3 hours, but the decay timer was around 1
day till decay...  which means they've been dead for about 6 days, and the
guy logged out upon his death...
