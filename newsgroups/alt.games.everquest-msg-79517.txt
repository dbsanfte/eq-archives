Heh, you want to build the BEST EQ Computer system ever?  Well, think BIGGER
:)  Yeah, best CPU and vid card you can buy are truly important.  And anyone
can do that and for pretty cheap these days but that isn't anything
*special* :)  For instance, you can get 1GB of DDR Ram for 400 bucks and
that is one stick.  So let's say you get a mobo with at least 3 ram slots
*which most have* though 4 would be truly optimal, buy 3 or 4 gigs of that
DDR Ram, and then install EQ into a Ram Drive - can you say kill the slowest
part of loading?  Also, you want 4 gigs because with each expansion, that EQ
folder keeps growing and growing so you want room for that, i.e. 1 gig for
system RAM since gotta have all the models loaded with all the options :)
and then 3 gig Ram Drive to transfer EQ into.  Yeah, it goes poof if power
dies but if you think about it, online games were designed for Ram Drives
because the only thing changing is your log files, your eqclient.ini file,
and your character option files.  Everything else stays the same except for
patches *and with Ram Drive XP, it autobackups files you select in the
background and for patches, just log in with the EQ on your HD so you KNOW
it is saved since you'll transfer EQ into Ram every time you reboot or
before you play, which works for me since I don't believe in turning
computers off anyway - just wish MicroCrap Windows 98 on my computer I have
now would cooperate with that and stop crashing*

Yeah, you'd want the best vid card and best CPU and a really fast HD for the
transfer into RAM and all the other cool gadgets that other people building
an uber computer would go for but why settle for the same old same old?
Yeah, all that RAM costs but it is a LOT cheaper than it used to be.  And
hey, if I'm right, I'd load any zone blisteringly fast since my HD wouldn't
be my bottleneck; heck, my broadband connection would be my bottleneck which
doesn't seem to matter since modem players with better computers than me are
able to load faster, even though I have broadband which kicks the crap outta
modems, connection-wise, probably due to the fact Verant has optimized the
download needed when zoning to as small a file as possible so modem players
aren't totally screwed over.  And so, with that system, you'd load faster
than anyone who doesn't do the same thing or until the next bigger better
CPU and vid card come out but even then, unless they do the Ram idea, you'd
still zone faster :)

Just my two coppers.
