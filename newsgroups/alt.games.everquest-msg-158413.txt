I still use Remedy.  But I'm no expert or 'min/max' kinda guy - I just
go with what seems most useful.  :-)

My 'typical' line up

1) Remedy - keep the robed wonders alive FAST.
2) Cel Heal
3) CH
4) Nuke (or 3rd stun, depending)
5) Stun 1 (or undead nuke, depending)
6) Shield of Words/Stun 2/Pacify
7) DA
8) swap out spot, usually instill or atone.

My 'chain stun' hotkey fires 4, 5 and 6.  All 3 are rather
situational, but the hotkey usually works just fine for most
scenarios.

Dinged 54 last night and now my Hammer Pet lives in slot 8.  I love
that little guy!
