Here is a summary of what I posted on the Everquest Tech boards (no answer
yet) I'm kind of desesparate so I post it on this newsgroup also, hoping
someone could help me out :

Hello,
I am subscribed for over a year to Everquest now, however the credit card I
paid my subscription with, just expired.
Today, saturday November 3th, when I tried to connect to Everquest I
received an error 1014 stating that I had not an activated account and
couldn't connect to EQ, and my characters would be saved for 3 months.

I immediatly wanted to resubscribe and filled in the ingame form with my new
billing information (which remained the same, save for the credit card
expiration date, credit card number remains the same).

Once this was completed I clicked finish and got a window saying "Validating
billing information...
Please wait... this could take a while..."
After a minute or so I got another window "Error 1016 : Lost connection to
the everquest server. Cancel to the main screen and reconnect to try again"
This happened over 40(!)times now in 3 hours time...

Is it possible that the verification of the billing information is not
online during weekends? Or is it a full automatic process (which I think it
is)?

Anyway, my characters are on the movelog from Morrel-Thule server to the new
European Antonius Bayle server. This movelog will take place next
tuesday and since I am a guild leader I must tranfer my leadership to one of
my guild officers... this can't be done if I can't get back online by that
time! I would like some advice please.

Regards,

Venomia.

A day later now and still getting the error 1016, so I can't enter my new
billing info and can't connect to the game... this is getting ridiculous.
When browsing through this forum I noticed several other customers had the
same problem, but no solution was given other than to phone to Sony in the
USA, which should be interesting as my spoken english is really
bad...(shiver)

I think Sony desactivated my account because my old credit card expired. My
new one has the EXACT same number, only the expiration date changed from end
October 2001 to end October 2003!
I think Sony automatically locked the credit card number in the database of
their billing server, thinking it has expired...

Well I don't know how it is for other banks, but with Euro Master Card every
customer has an UNIQUE credit card number that remains the same on the new
credit card once the old one expired, as I said only the validation date
gets updated!

I could rule out the maxed out option because I checked with my bank card
company (yes, they work in weekends! not like some other companies I
know)and the last payment request from Sony was on October 2nd (they allways
billed me on the 2nd of every month since I started my account), but NO
payment request was issued on November 2nd and my account got desactivated
on November 3d!

I am now desesperate because I can only try to contact Sony by phone Monday
morning EST (Monday night in my country)the earliest, which not only means I
am facing 3 or 4 days without EQ at least,(I can live with that) but that my
characters which are on the /movelog to the new European server MIGHT NOT BE
MOVED since my account has been desactivated! Which is a lot worse!

I already send 2 mails to accounts@sony.station.com but as they don't work
on weekends I didn't get any reply yet.

Please help me!

Venomia.

Ok, now I am clueless...
I tried to edit the billing information using my father's credit card and I
STILL get the 1016 error : Connection lost with server, cancel back to main
screen, and try again...
And there is NOTHING wrong with my connection!

OMG this is bad, real bad!

Venomia.
