That Pullman series had me spellbound.  I don't usually buy books, much
cheaper to borrow from library, but I just had to have them all after I
started reading the first one.  Bought all 3 within a week of seeing the
first one at the library, that's a record for me, I don't always do that
with my all-time fave author Stephen King's books.
