Pardon me.  It was exportation to other countries. By law here in the
US it is illegal to export encryption stronger than 128-bits.=20
Secondly, if you feel it's annoying then that's your opinion.  It
seems that I have started posting on this thread you have had nothing
good to say to me so far.  I humbly ask that if you do not like
something that I say or the way I post, please do not flame me with
you infintile ways.  But, thanks for letting me know how you feel, it
has changed my life... really.
