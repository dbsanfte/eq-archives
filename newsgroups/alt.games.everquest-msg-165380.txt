-    What sort of money do we have to play with, how much weight do
you have
-to use? Comparing with my monk twink, these are the areas I see as
being
-projects:
-
-Shoulders: Acrylia Reinforced Mantle has nice AC, and STA/HPs.
-Back: there's a few cloaks out there with a ton of +HPs, like
Shimmering
-Terror Hide. They're mostly down in the 1 K or less range, too. Go to
the
-Bazaar and do a monk, back, HPs search.
-Weapons: my monk is using the freebie Goranga club from Maiden's Eye
(No
-Drop, ask politely if you can loot one from a group killing them) and
a SoS
-offhand. At the very least you should look into the SoS for offhand -
at
-17/28 it's hard to beat for sheer damage and for aggro control.
-
-    Everything else looks about par for the course. I don't like that
neck
-item much for the low AC, but the HPs are good and you can put off
the
-upgrade there.

I have about 2k in the bank and as far as weight goes I am around 16.


Thanks for the suggestions thus far, and sorry for that email reply :)
