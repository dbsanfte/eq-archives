Personally at 25 as a warrior I moved on to Lake of Ill Omen for
soloing, Frontier Mountains Giants for small groups, and also played
around a bunch at Marus Seru; it was much easier to find a group
there, but at the same time it was quite possible to solo, with lots
of lower level single pullable mobs.

LOIO and FM should have been better, but they are so deserted now that
"solo while looking for a group" turned into "solo here all day"

Also popular is (or was) HHK, but back in the day that meant waiting
on a list for the only camp worth doing at your level (one of three,
but each with its own level range)  and currently might mean either
soloing a camp or lumping it, for all I know, since I have no idea
whether the place is deserted or not.  Didn';t try it with my warfrog.

Defeat, 30 warfrog, retired and deleted
