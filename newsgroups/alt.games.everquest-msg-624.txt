Rube of the week for me (maybe I'll start posting this on a weekly basis)
was a barbarian warrior who took 10 minutes to make one trade(while the rest
of the group was barely holding its own).  He would ninja-loot everthing.
When I inquired why he was ninja-looting, he replied "I just bought a good
1h so now I'm poor and I need the cash".

I had to laugh.
