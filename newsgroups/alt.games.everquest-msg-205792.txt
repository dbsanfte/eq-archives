My 44 Druid on Stromm has an AC over 600.  That's a leather class
character for whom there is no decent AC gear available (new server).
I'm guessing that your Defense skill is quite low, not sure how to
raise it as a 51 Cleric, but that may be a very good place to start
(find blue-con mobs that you can survive allowing to beat on you).
If I'm wrong about your Defense, then there have to be an incredibly
large number of easily attainable items that will raise your AC
substantially, shop the bazaar to learn about tradeable gear and the
usual prices, research on the web for NODROP stuff.  But yeah, 700 is
ridiculously low for a 51 Cleric.
