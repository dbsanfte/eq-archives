	Warriors can crit with any weapon.  Warriors also get Crippling
Blows, which occur when a Warrior gets a crit while Berserk.

	Rogues can crit with any thrown weapon.

	Rangers can crit with bows.

	


>How is the damage calculated?

	IIRC, crits do a minimum of [(2 * DMG) + Level Damage Bonus].
Which means that you can get a "critical" hit that does less damage than
your MAX damage for the weapon.  This becomes more and more common as you
get MAX increases due to gains in weapon skill.

	IIRC, Crippling Blows do a minimum of [(4 * DMG) + Level Damage
Bonus].

	Verant has claimed that DEX affects Crit rate.  Unless something
has changed since last summer, this is incorrect.  Nothing seems to affect
Crit rate.  Warriors seem to crit about 2-3% of the time, regardless of
DEX, STR, AGI, or any other factors.  As a consequence, Critical Hits are
really nothing more than eye candy at later levels.  They certainly don't
account for a significant amount of damage output.

	At lower levels, if you have a good weapon, a nice crit *can* make
a huge difference in a fight.  A large-race warrior with an LotW can crit
for over 100 points once they hit 20th and break out of the DMG cap.  This
is a non-trivial amount of HP for the things you'll be fighting at 20th
level.
