I'm not sure if anyone has ever told you this, Pamela, but you're
using a lowercase 'l' (ell) instead of an uppercase I (eye) all over
the place.

If it's intentional, disregard this post.  It's just weird seeing you
say "l did this" and "l did that" with a lowercase ell instead of an
uppercase eye all over the place.
