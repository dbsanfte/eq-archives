Apparantly (and I have no actual experience with this yet, at my lofty 
level of 45), they changed this so that the first tier stuns work up to 
55, the second tier (which I already have, since 40 or so) work up to 
60, and the third tier (still quite a ways off into my future) work up 
to 65.

Since the stuns are all identical in nature; insta cast 12 second 
refresh, and all share the same timer with all other stuns, snares, and 
jolts, but cost substantially more pp for the components, this upgrade 
in level is one of the few reasons to ever use anything but the lowest 
level version.

Other reason being that at least the second tier stun is based on a 
longer range axe, so its range is 150 instead of 125, although I've 
never needed much range on the stuns... the Snare having a longer range 
is on occaision handy.

Third reason is that its easy to run out of component axes when you are 
busy, I keep second tier axes on me as a backup to cover that 
eventuality, switch to them for the current fight, and then make first 
tier axes after.  Sort of like driving around with a spare tank of gas 
in the trunk for emergencies.
