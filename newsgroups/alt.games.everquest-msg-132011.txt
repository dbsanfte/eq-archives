Since I have been killing alot of spiders for exp, figured I might as
well do something with the silk, so I got a large sewing kit and have
been combining them to make silk swatches.  From looking at eqtraders
and other places, it looks like as your skill grows you can then start
combining other things, such as, it looks like my next step will be
the swatches combined with some pattern to make silk armor.   So, I
see the need for raw materials and patterns, but what are the sewing
books I see vendors selling ?   Do I need to buy one of these before I
can make armor ?   Thanks!
