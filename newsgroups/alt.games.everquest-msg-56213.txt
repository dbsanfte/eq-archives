Well, I believe there is / was plenty of fun in a pure fantasy role playing
game, before the wishlisters wanted to be monsters. You had choices of
umpteen lands, many races, classes, skills, magic spells up the cuzoo, but
no, the wishlisters are right, the programmers overlooked playing....the
monsters? Maybe later the wishlisters will want to be the scenery. (How does
it feel to be a rocky outcropping?)

I don't give a shit about the server being down, I had to work all day
anyway. Wife, 2 kids, errands. It's not all EQ wishlisting for some of us.

It's just a remarkably silly wish, and I am stunned that anyone paid any
attention to such a thing.

YOU ALL must have whined loudly to get that idea heard.

"I wanna be a monster." Good for you. Chances are you are succeeding.
