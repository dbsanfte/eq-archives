Those items (TBoots, JBoots, SoW potions) are not realistically
available to a player for many, many, many levels of play.

: Find a spot where you can pull singles,

Easier said than done.

: and on the rare occaision where an add shows up,

Ha!

: run away!

And if a mage needs to zone, that means re-summoning the pet,
re-summoning the pet armor, re-summoning the pet weapons,
re-buffing the pet, and medding up to full mana.  Say goodbye
to 10 minutes of your life.

: Plus there's always gate, you know...

And then the long trip back to where you were, besides all the
stuff I just mentioned above.  Besides, you're assuming the
mage is able to channel gate through a beating.

People have decided that since mages can solo white and some
yellow cons, they're solo gods.  They're not.  They can't handle
adds that attack the mage rather than the pet.

It's a HUGE disadvantage.  I'll grant you that mages are very
good when fighting just a single mob at a time, though.
