But on the other hand, the rights of minorities, be they racial, 
religious or sexual, are acknowledged and, largely, respected now. 
Women's rights also have come a long way... while glass ceilings still 
exist, at least they are no longer enshrined in law (outside the 
Catholic Church, that is).

Yes, but while the Soviet Union failed to establish itself as a Worker's 
Paradise due to corruption and greed, its very existence had a 
tremendously positive effect on Worker's Rights movements throughout the 
20th Century. At the very least, the corporate machine had to admit that 
the Proletariat had some bite behind its bark, and improve working 
conditions in a way that they wouldn't have otherwise.

I suppose I mean the two after the proper trilogy (my memory is hazy, 
but I think they are the ones where he introduces the Gaians). I haven't 
been much of an Asimov fan since my teens, but even so I won't hold the 
good doctor responsible for anything he didn't write himself.

Mostly. Although Asimov is not alone in it, it really irks me no end 
when writers nearing the end of their careers insist on tying together 
all their output into one single universe via horrid, incoherent bridge 
novels. I seem to remember (this may be a SPOILER) one novel in which 
two robots make the Earth radioactive so as mankind is forced to leave 
it and so avoid stagnation, thus tying together the Robots and 
Foundation series... I wasn't impressed.

Admittedly, all my memories of Asimov novels are going on twenty years 
old, so it may be time for a re-visit.
