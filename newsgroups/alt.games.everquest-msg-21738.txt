Although playing everquest has been alot of fun I have decided to stop
playing.  I have cancled my account and it has expired.  I hate to see the
account never used again though so I am offering it to someone else.  main
char is a 30 human shadow knight.  he has a blade of xalgoz (2hs 23 dam 40
del +3 str.) and another 2hs that is 24 delay 40 damage.  he has full
finesteel except the back and boots.  the back is bronze and boots Charred.
Most of the visable pieces of FS are dyed blue and look very cool.
blacksmithing is at 135.  Other chars on Tunare are 24 euridite necro,
decked out int is 195, he has alot of nice things on him that I cant
remember what they are because I aquired them from a friend who was quitting
too.  I also have a lvl 16 druid and a lvl 6 enchanter,  and a few other
chars.

If you are interested in this account please write me at renae@networld.com
with your offers.
