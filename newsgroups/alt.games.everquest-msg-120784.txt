Another useful tip for low level pet owners, is to give the pet a rusty 2
hander or similar. They cant dual wieeld till 24 orr 29, so you give them
the highest damage 2 hander you can get. Pets always hit with a set delay,
independant of weapon, so only the damage of the wepon is a factor. Theres a
place in south freeport (hallards) that sells rusty 2 handers in unlimited
supply. Now you dont have to worry about being outdamaged by the pet,
levelling should be crazy.
