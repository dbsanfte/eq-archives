Well, out of personal experience, I would submit Denmark, and out of 
second hand reports, Luxemburg, Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand, 
Australia, any Scandinavian country and The Netherlands. I'm sure there 
are lists online of the best countries to live in drawn under different 
criteria... If I have time I'll dredge up some.

Having said that, I *have* lived in the US, I loved it, and I would live 
there again in a heartbeat... Perhaps it's not the place where I would 
choose to raise a family, but for a young(ish), single guy drawing a 
good salary, it was unbeatable.

Well, that's self-evidently untrue, as the EU demonstrates. And besides, 
you yourself are asking for some goverment intervention anyway; that's 
an admission that the free market cannot self-police abusers. It seems 
to me that the only disagreement we have is the amount of government 
intervention that's desirable.
