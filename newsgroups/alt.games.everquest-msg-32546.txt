My Experince has been that if you drag a corspe that is not your own, you
will aggro.  When I was with some friends who wiped out at Kael Tormax area,
I was able to go in uninvis and drag my corpse to zone with no trouble.  I
then /corpsed on a friend's corspe, without even being consented, and I was
immediately aggroed.
