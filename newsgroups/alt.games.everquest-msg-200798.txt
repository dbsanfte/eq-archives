At level 58 when you get the incomplete heal, canni IV plus Kragg's Mending  
is far superior to KEI.  Effective regen rate is in the neighborhood of 45 
mana per tick, if you have enough hp to take full advantage of Kragg's.  
That puts it at over 3 times the mana regen rate of KEI.  Of course, adding 
KEI on top of that is awesome.  At low levels, it is nowhere near as 
effective, but still a handy tool.
