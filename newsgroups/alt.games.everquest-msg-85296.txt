Yes it does still exist, not sure what you meant by not getting exp for a
mob kill but in duelling it does still happen. It was reportedly fixed long
ago but never was, or at least not 100%
The only way you can guarantee no exp loss is duel in PvP area, the trouble
with Necros is that fear can take you out of that area and if the dot kills
you then you will lose exp for the death (happened to me before, has also
happened when I was killed by a pet's life tap proc, again outside of PvP
area..whether it was the proc that caused the lifetap or the fact that a pet
did it I am not sure)
As for bards DoTs I can't comment, I think your songs are considered
different to spells so probably aren't effected by this "bug"
