I made my first visit there last weekend. At level 64 the exp per kill
was quite weak with a full group. I suspect that means most mobs are
level 58 (like PoStorms desert) or maybe a little lower. My group
didn't go very far in, just up the big hill and over one bridge.
Maybe it gets better deeper in.
