Its very hard to guess.  I'll give you a couple hints

The password to the channel auctions is auctions
The password to the channel cyber is cyber

As a general rule, first thing to try for password to any
channel is the channel's name.  If you don't use a password
at all, it seems you frequently get a buggy channel that
people can't join, so the simplest easiest to figure out
password is used, unless you actually want to keep
people out.
