> "Host not found" "No DNS entry for host"

> "File MFC42.DLL" was missing.

Both of these problems are not EQ specific.  Have you reconfigured your
machine or installed/uninstalled some software lately?

Host not found can happen when 1) Your ISP is not working, OR 2) Your TCP/IP
Settings are not configured properly.

MFC42.DLL is the "Microsoft Foundation Class" runtime library component
version 4.2.  It is shared by many software programs that were created using
Visual C++.  The only way I can think this file was removed is 1) It became
corrupt, or 2)Someone uninstalled some software and selected to remove
shared components.
