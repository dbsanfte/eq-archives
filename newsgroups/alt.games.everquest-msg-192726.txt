Jeez you are such a nit pick... 8 )

and difference duly noted, and I did know the difference before, but
obvioulsy chose the wrong word...
so what your saying is there is no read between the lines with ya...
must state things exactly....  its all black and white.   so I used
the word decide.. so you clung to that as an incorrect statement.

How bout:  
"What makes you the one who states whats popular and whats not
pouplar?"  8 )

is that specific enough for you to not turn this not a grammer /
english lesson?
