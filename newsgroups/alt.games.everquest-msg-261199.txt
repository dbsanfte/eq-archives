Nope.  First thing I checked.

Also get another weird "look-through-the- zone" effect in some places
(like PoK)  If I turn a certain direction, I can see to the end of the
zone, and still see all the dynamic lights (torches, etc), but
everything else is invisible.  I can't walk through walls and fall for
20k, but they definetly aren't visible in front of me.
