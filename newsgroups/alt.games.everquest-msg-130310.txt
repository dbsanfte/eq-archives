I am playing a level 23 necro and so far FD has worked with mixed results.
I have read that there are certain conditions under which it will work and I
want to make sure I understand them.

FD will NOT work if the MOB has been DOT'd.  The reason for this is that you
are still attacking the MOB.  Is this true for other "over time" spells like
Engulfing Darkness and other slow/debuff type spells?

In order to make FD work properly, the MOB must hit you first.  This makes
the MOB think that it killed you with the last hit.  Does this mean if you
are being attacked by multiple MOB's that they all have to hit you first?

FD has saved my butt a few times, but it has failed just as often.  I really
need to figure out when and how it works.

Thanks
