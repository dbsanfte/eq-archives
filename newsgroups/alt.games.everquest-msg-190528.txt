So, if you purchased 100kpp from Yantis, he delivered, and Sony decided the
transaction violated the EULA and simply took the plat away from your
character, would you blame Yantis, Sony, or yourself?  That's $250 down the
drain.

I, being honest, would have to be pissed at myself, because I broke the
rules and am out the cash.  Of course, if I didn't know that he doesn't have
the right to sell platinum, which is an artifact of the game and therefore
belongs solely to Sony, I might want to blame Yantis, since that makes the
transaction fraudulent.  Even if he has no direct contract with Sony, any
platinum he acquires as agent of a player merely adds conspiracy to the
charge.

Cheers,
Eric
