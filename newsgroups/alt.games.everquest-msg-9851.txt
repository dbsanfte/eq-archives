Servers tend to grow into their own, and you won't really know the feel of
it until you play it.  I have found Drinal for instance to have alot of
polite people on it, but it has a reputation for having alot of cheap people
(Haven't experienced that first hand though), so you have to sell slightly
lower.  I guess, just try different servers to see what you like... although
the downfall to that is not being able to twink your alts if you want to.

What you will find is that the more established servers have a higher ratio
of high level PC's which tend to reduce the number of newbies running
around.

As for human, go right ahead if that is what you like.  I have found
different classes seem to fit better into different races, but your opinions
will most likely vary.  Humans tend to be regarded as middle of the pack.
They aren't lacking in any one skill, but they don't exceed in one either...
also the night-blindness thing is a turn off to some.  I have a friend who
has been playing since beta and only plays humans.
