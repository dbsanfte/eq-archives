The mob sets are calculated using a five level difference. If it helps
you understand what I meant, let me rephrase the above: The "hard"
scale is simply the "normal" scale with the party average level being
the next mob set higher. So the mobs you get with a L25 average hard
are the exact same mobs you get with a L30 average normal. The sets
happen to be separated by increments every five levels, and occur
somewhere very close to the *3/*8 (though some will say not exactly,
I've never extensively tested the absolute exact number) mark. So the
mob sets are for levels:

20-23 (average)
23-28
28-33
33-38
38-43
43-48
48-53
53-58
58-63
63-65

With one further mob set for L63-65 hards (what would have been the
L68-73 normal).

There is only one scale of mob levels. Putting in a medium set would
require a whole new scale. That's more work than some would realize,
though IMO not a *huge* amount of new work. It might happen someday.
