As you note, SOW potions are useless for emergencies.  This is because 
it takes time to drink them, which counts as casting time.  If you 
aren't a bard, and you cast a spell, if your position when you finish 
casting isn't the exact same one as when you started casting, then you 
will almost certainly be interrupted.

Not only can't you cast it while running, but you probably can't cast it 
while being beat on, which tends to move you around and otherwise interrupt.

Its worse than you might think from that, though, because while you 
might be able to channel an equally long casting spell 90% of the time 
while being beat on, drinking a potion doesn't use your Channelling 
skill, so your odds of an interrupt go way up.

Another popular means of increasing your run speed, Travellors' Boots, 
also have a casting time.  The original item with this speed boost, 
Journeyman's Boots, which requires a moderately annoying quest, is 
Instant Click, which means no cast time at all; this never gets 
interrupted by a beating, and can be cast while moving.

Run speed is an AA, which means you need level 51+ to buy it, and have 
to spend exp on it, but it makes you faster than mobs always, no need to 
activate, no need to click, no using up a buff slot, no worries about 
getting dispelled.

A mount is also an always up effect, but it takes a buff slot and 
suffers such aggregious acceleration issues that I almost think they are 
useless for escape situations, plus of course they don't work indoors.

A fairly reliable way to stay faster than mobs is really the simplest 
and cheapest: group with a SOW caster (indoors, group with a Shrew 
caster).
