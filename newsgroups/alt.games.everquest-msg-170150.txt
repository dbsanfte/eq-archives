I don't believe that is true.  I've hit a zone fleeing with DA up and
had it still up when I got to the other side, and it was taking me 15
to 30 seconds to zone at that time.  Also, at least one of the people
who has spoken to me of "Hole Diving" was a slow zoner (> 30 sec for
most zones), I think she'd have noticed going splat on the "dive".

*shrug* I should get a HS key and try it.  I do recall that when this
subject came up some months back, the poster reported that the tactic
(send in DA'd Paladin first) worked fine.  Perhaps you need to clear
the area, or at least mez the mobs, outside the zone-in first?
