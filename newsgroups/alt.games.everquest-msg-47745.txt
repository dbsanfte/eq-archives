Ohhh.. I took it as you casted it before you began.. makes MUCH more sense
now.

You take x damage and the mob takes whatever your DS is doing at whatever
level you are.

If that weren't the case (which be nice if it did absorb) you would have far
more health than you have had. :)

I didn't say I wasn't taking damage... :)  Thats untrue by far.  However,
when I was your level (and yes with Chloro, never said I didn't use that
either) I was at full health when I laid the last smacketh down to finally
kill them.  Too bad LOIO is Kunark. ;p

An assling no doubt. ;p I'm willing to bet you were unconscious.  It seems
to be when "Pain and Suffering" rears his ugly head (if you could see it
that is).  I suppose its clear.. he is the Grim Reaper of EQ.  Why lay there
bleeding to death unconscious.. he is there to ease your "Pain and
Suffering." <grin>  Nice of him, huh...?
