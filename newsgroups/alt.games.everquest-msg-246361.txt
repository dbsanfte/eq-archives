Try any tier 1 plane. Clerics born on LDoN easy get a real
bitchslapping when they move out of that arena. They get so hooked on
their heal over time finesse shit that when the heavy-hitters come
they piss their pants while the tank dies. They *have* to drop heals
at certain times and having that timing be on to be effective, they
simply do not get that training in LDoN easy.

Take a cleric who has only done LDoN easy and have him in a group
fighting Hrei in BoT.. he'll kill the tank knowing no better. LDoN
easy is all about lesser hits but more mobs.. old style grinding tier
1+ is more about less mobs but much harder hits.

Assassinations suck.. mainly because you don't want to have to cross
the entire dungeon every time to finish.

And anybody who chooses a rescue should frankly be shot. Trusting your
win to SOE programmer NPC pathing is not an option.
