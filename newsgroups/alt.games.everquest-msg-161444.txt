Missed my point totally. The original promo for PoP was content for all
levels.
Instead we got marginal content for small percentage of the players playing
and the levels were not needed. They could add more AA but 5 more levels,
great so now a group of 6 will be able to own any pre-Luclin mob like Kunark
dragons and such. Yeah that helps the game. Right....

Drop the sarcasm please everyone is entitled to a viewpoint and a to post
here.
