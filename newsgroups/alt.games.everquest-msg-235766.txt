Ever farther OT: try this one on ten people: "which has a bigger
gravitational effect on the Moon, the Earth or the Sun?".

Most people will say Earth, but it is actually the Sun.  The Moon is the
only moon in the solar system where the force from the Sun is higher than
the force from the planet it orbits.

(And if you consider further, you'll realize that this means that the Moon
*doesn't* orbit the Earth.  Rather, the Earth and Moon are more accurately
viewed as two planets in roughly the same orbit around the Sun.  If you were
to plot the path of the Moon for a year, you would get a path around the Sun
that is convex--basically a rounded duodecagon.  Same for the Earth, with
its rounded duodecagon aligned differently.  Basically, Earth and Moon are
going around the Sun, taking turns cutting inside each other's path, so from
either, it appears to be going around the other).
