I am having a problem in Luclin.
I have installed the upgrade and everything works (sort of).
I create a character in Luclin (beastlord), but after about 5 minutes the
character starts to slow down and jerk like severe lag but just on my pc.  I
log out the beast lord and bring up other character and they work fine.  Go
back to the beast lord and have the problem again.  I notice that keyboard
activity goes into a buffer and will eventually process, but soon the buffer
fills and I get a buz when I hit a key.

Any suggestions?
