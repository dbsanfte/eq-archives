    It's a nightmare waiting to happen. How do you quantify things like
that? How do you put in points sinks for such activities(remember, any
activity that awards points must also contain points sinks to avoid
pointsflation)? Where is the line drawn - I made a pile of PotC items for
the guild, what do I get? I took the time to go to Chardok and res someone,
what do I get? If I don't get anything for it, will I become less likely to
do it? HUGE minefield there.

    By "main tanks", I mean warriors. And the person doing all the whining
has received loot well out of whack with her attendance, or lack thereof.
She sings in /gu non-stop, she whines about how nobody helps her with quests
(this from a person with 10th ring, Spirit-Wracked cord, all her Vex Thal
shards and her sceptre frame done, her Solstice earring....) She stirs up
drama on the boards by reacting always with emotion, never with logic (she
even made a post about how logic would just make her like a man, and she had
no use for them - yes, she's gay). Hell, I've been tempted to block her out
more than a few times!

    We're lucky in that we stop most problems in recruiting. When you
recruit the player, and not the character, you spot potential interpersonal
problems faster. But we still have a few volatile older members that like to
blow up from time to time.
