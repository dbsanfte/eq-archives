    You don't have to wait until you level again if you have any practice
points left. If you do have one left just go to the trainer and put a point
into it.

    If you have used them all then, yes you will need to wait until you
level.

    After that all you need to do is check the 'abilities' section and click
on an open box, this will allow you to bind the 'forage' ability to that
hotkey.
