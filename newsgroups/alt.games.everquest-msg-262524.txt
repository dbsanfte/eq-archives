Funny you should mention this.

If a mob charms a PC, funny things happen to him; he loses all his melee 
bonuses, but gains mob style channeling skills.  I remember doing the 
sirens right outside SG with a couple buddies a while back, and learning 
that the 60 warrior was going to be an utter joke if he got charmed, but 
the druid getting charmed was occaision to zone as she'd be slapping off 
those outsized nukes right and left and there would be no way of 
stopping her.

Funny things happening to mobs charmed in a few zones (if I understand 
it right its only the new zones where this works this way) doesn't seem 
so out of line to me; I'm used to charm working weird!
