I can see why they changed it. I'm sure it will be more welcomed thing 
to some than others. /shrug

I'm all for cleaning up the layout of the item window. I just hope it'll 
keep now me from buying that awesome item that I find out only after 
purchase and attempted equipping that have a required level that I do 
not yet meet. :P

Well, *technically* you'll be skilling it up from your new level number. 
;)

I've personally liked almost every zone revamp they've done - Freeport 
being the lone exception (yeah, I've even liked both attempts at 
Neriak).

It'll be a nice improvement. That always bugged me with bolt spells.

Yup. It'll be good to have it fixed.

Good change overall, I'd say.

Does that mean they've created robe models for Ogres and Trolls?

God, I hope this fixes my cursor problems the way they say it will. It's 
also nice that I won't have to deal with those obnoxious animated ads 
from Allakhazam's bleeding through my game window.
