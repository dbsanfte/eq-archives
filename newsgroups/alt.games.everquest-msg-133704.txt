That's the best glossary I know for EQ.

Although it's tempting to write the "bad" glossary, like so:

Peeps: Those tasty marshmallow treats shaped like baby chicks, available
every spring.

TP to WC: Someone just went to the john without their "important papers" and
needs someone else to fetch them a roll.

PST: Pacific Standard Time. Offers may vary in other time zones.

PLZ: Please, LuZer.... a beg for help and an insult all in one.

U: Unable to type out you.

SoW: An adult female pig.

Crack: What people fall in, exiting High Hold Pass via East Karana.

Burned Woods: A zone that changes position weekly, depending upon the whim
of programers, and evil necros who refuse to hand out pigs.

I'm sure there's a lot more than that. But that's enough for now.
