I wasn't tempted to upgrade my cleric's epic until the Hammer of Holy
Vengence dropped. But then, I've never much been into the melee cleric
thing. If I want to melee I play an alt that can do real dps.

I have to admit though, I do like meleeing now with the HoHV. For some
reason the spell parsers seem to have missed the fact that the proc is
also a group heal. Not only does damage it heals your group for 61 hp
each time it goes off, 122 crit, which I get a lot of. I just checked
Lucy, and it lists the heal as 50 so I guess it's affected by aa and/or
focus as well.
