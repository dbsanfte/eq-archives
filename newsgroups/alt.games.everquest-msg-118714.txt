The circumstances vary. There were solid reasons behind all the
examples you gave. We need a bit more of a solid reason than "It's
just wrong" to see your point of view on this one.

Also, all the examples you gave were agreed to be "wrong" behaviors in
human or animal. Animals feeding off animals has actually been proven
to be beneficial to the predator and the prey's herds, as well as
several other animals in the particular ecosystem.
