Here's what I would suggest as a Druid

Druid SOWs
Druid or Necro snares/darkness
Necro and/or Druid Dots
Root (Druid) or fear (Necro)
Pet optional and only if fearing (A rooted giant will kill your pet pretty
easily)

By myself I can DOT and root/fear 2 blues without a problem and usually handle
3. Get an enchanter and the three of you could probably park in the middle of
the giant spawn and just go nuts.
