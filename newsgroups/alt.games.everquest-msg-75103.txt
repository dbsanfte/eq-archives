 Mobs on a two minute timer don't make it that much harder. And really
it doesn't lead to clearing a dungeon like it should be done. Our normal
procedure is to clear the see invis worms then invis up and move. Which
basically diminishes the challenge. I'm guessing that's the opposite of
what Verant intended to have happen.

 That'd be nice. We stayed and did experience on raptors once in
zoneout. They're not very tough and the experience was fairly good.
Obviously with a two minute respawn time you don't run out of things to
kill.
