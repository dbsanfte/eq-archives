hehe.. 
I am 55 mage with better then average hp's and ac for a mage.
The other day I gated  in to firepot room and WHAMM.. Faydedar
immediately started beating the crap out of, never even saw her as she
was behind me as I gated in.

Luckily I was prepared for this to happen some day... so I had bound
myself right in front of the lava lamp for Ak'Anon.
Everytime I gate I face west so I am facing it when I gate in...
Well I QUICKLY clicked on the lava lamp and when I wound up in Ak'Anon
I found myself little under 2 bubbles of health left.. and that
happened in the blink of a eye.. or so it seem!! ;-)

I aways pause for a moment right there in front of the lamp to see if
anything attacks me, if not then I turn around and head to the pot I
need to go to.
