Actually, I did get Luclin for free. But that's not the point...

What you paid for those games covered SOME of the developement. You
realize dealer mark-up is generally 100%, which means they only got
half of the price per copy. Then there's marketting, packaging,
distribution, etc. That doesn't leave much profit per copy when it
comes down to it. And that was only a "one-time" cash boost, that's
not a monthly cash flow to cover the DAILY costs of keeping up the
servers.

You really don't understand business at all, do you? Either that or
you were being intentionally assanine.
