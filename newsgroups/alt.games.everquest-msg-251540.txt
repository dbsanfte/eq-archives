At the risk of hijacking .....

/agree

This is why I use Napster.  I pay 10 bucks a month for all the music I care
to stream.  Extra if I want to burn it (which is something I rarely do ...
I'm more interested in streaming while I'm at work than I am downloading a
bunch of stuff).  But should a song pop up that I can't get out of my head,
I'll burn it for 99 cents, which is cheaper than buying an entire CD for the
one or two songs I'm interested in.

It only makes sense, though, if you typically buy music monthly.  I
typically bought 3 - 4 CDs/month, so premium Napster makes much more sense.
Plus I like their library.  Of course, your mileage may vary.
