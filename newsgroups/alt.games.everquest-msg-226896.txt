I guess what started this post for me was that the guild loot policy was
being determined on the fly and was totally not within the guidelines of
the loot policy that I joined under and agreed to. If I know what the loot
policy is and agree to it then its my fault for staying in the guild if I
dont
like the policy. It just started to become very obvious that rules were
being
bent so that peeps in "the click" so to speak were getting an unfair
advantage.
I overall have good gear and mostly turn down items because they are
not an upgrade or not a big enough upgrade to worry about.

So i guess what i'm asking is what raiding guilds on Bertoxx us a DKP
type system so i can narrow down my search.

Thanks
