Pet will not get agro without taunting if the kiter casts enough high 
agro spells on the mob.  It may be slower killing than going pure melee, 
but, if you are trying to kill mobs that you cannot solo melee, then, 
this is a method that can work.  It's not a method I would recommend for 
a BL, but, it can work.  BLs have some very high agro spells, slow, and 
DoTs that can work wonders for keeping agro on the BL instead of the 
warder.  BLs also get nice pet heal spells, and, generally, can allow a 
slowed mob to smack the warder around some while regaining agro 
themselves.

Having used this method as a shaman, I know that you do not need to find 
pathing bugs to make it work.  It's a pain in the butt, and definitely 
not my preferred method, but, it can, and does work.
