Again, another post I never got to see.  I don't have a plonk file going, 
so that's not the reason either.  Starting to irk me.

Some of have better perception can tell the idiots from the ones who can't 
spell / construct good sentences / are foreign to American English.  Either 
that, or I misunderstand what you are saying.  It isn't hard to tell the 
ones who don't try to use good spelling, etc. from the the ones who are 
worthless fucks.

By the one paragraph I have to look at above, I don't consider you one of 
those idiots, although the sentence is quite convuluted ( or 10 hours of 
work today is keeping me from correctly linking the second half of the 
sentence to the first ) and there is a problem with subject / verb 
matching.  I can't type for shit, and there will probably be 10+ typos in 
this post, along with other grammatical / spelling mistakes.  But, I am 
making an attempt at doing things the "right" way.  It's the idiots who 
don't in EQ in my book.  They don't care about that, all they care about is 
getting those free buffs, and looking "cool" to their buds.

Most of the idiots that I come across choose to be an idiot and are easily 
spotted.  There are the rare ones that have impeccable spelling / grammar / 
typing skills, but the way they act gives them away fairly quickly.

There's a little pud on our server who has his own little cult following 
that makes him feel important.  Any zone he is in, he is always shouting 
about what he is doing at that moment, and all the little feebs are always 
responding to him in shout egging him on.  It's quite sad that all of his 
"cultists" have the mentality of drained prunes.  Oddly enough, all of the 
intelligent and mature people that I know that know him can't stand him.  
The guy types well, except when he doesn't want to, he's intelligent 
enough, it seems, too.  But, he's still an idiot, and the leader of a guild 
full of idiots.  Lucky him!

Either you missed the entire point, or are just being funny.  Not sure 
which, though.  Made me laugh, either way.

My add message is actually shorter than yours, most of the time.  Usually 
just "add 1"  "add 2", unless what was added matters, such as "add Revanant 
and pet!" or "add adherant - it is the target!" ( at which point I try to 
F9 and get it targeted so they can correctly assist )

It's -different- when you are in a group, as opposed to lameass_beggar_01 
wanting buffs.  Especially if you are in a gorup with people you group with 
a lot.
