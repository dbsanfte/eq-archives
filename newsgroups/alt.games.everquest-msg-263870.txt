Hmm. Don't see much fault with LDoN or LoY. Ditch PoP, GoD, OoW...
Keep the Vah'shir, Nexus, and Beastlords and ditch the rest of SoL
(except, of course, for reasonable BST gear). Works for me...

Got to the point where wandering into "traditional" levelling zones
(Oasis, LOIO, etc) and finding them to be ghost towns was depressing.
Paludal is a headache in a stone wrapper... Worse than LOIO ever was,
IMO. I miss Orc Highway groups. I miss fort groups in LOIO. I miss orc
camps in the Commons and Dervish camps in Ro.

A lot of good changes came along over the years, I won't deny that.
But so much was lost along the way. EQ just turned into a raiders'
playground and left the rest of us floundering behind...
