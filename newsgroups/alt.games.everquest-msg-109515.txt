LOL Sure, and the point in having GMs death touch entire zones to
prevent players from prevailing would be what? How many people do you
think would actually be stupid enough to pay a monthly fee to play a
game that is rigged against them? EQ is a game; games are designed to be
beaten. If VI has a problem with people legitimately beating the game as
it is designed and coded, they should revise their code, rather than
punishing people who play the game, as it was designed, and win. It's
hardly the fault of the player base that some members of it are brighter
than VIs game designers.
