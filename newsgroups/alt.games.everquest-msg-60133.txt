This is just great. I was going to hold off on starting research until
level 24 when I could dump some serious points into it, as per advice
from necro.eqclasses.com.
  Now, I see that if I want my level 20 pet spell, and I don't want to
research it, I've got to buy it in Ogguk!!?? (And as for getting
somebody else to research it, I haven't even found the words yet.) As
far as I know, even my Troll Warrior is apprehensive in Ogguk and, I
believe, KOS to the SK's there (Greenbloods faction, isn't it?) so I
don't think I can use him. Ok, sure, I could give up a character slot
and start a newbie to buy it, but come on now! The fucking pet
spell??!!!?? It's only like a class defining spell for necros.  What is
the thinking behind that????

So...... anyway, (/rant) my Human necro has surprised me before and
turned out to not be KOS in all sorts of places. Anybody taken one into
Ogguk? Is there some remote chance I can just stroll past the bouncers
at Dubious and walk into the SK guild and buy it?
