Weapon type does not affect damage.  The only considerations are the
damage, the delay, the process (if it has one, the level required to
process with it, and the resists involved in the process), your skill
with  the weapon, and how the weapon looks when you wield it.  

The first two of those considerations, damage and delay, are the most
important.  The third and fourth considerations, process and your
skill, are your next considerations. Why wield a weapon while you are
being hit if you have no skill with it.  Swap weapons and skill up
when mobs start to flee, but use your best weapon skill while you are
being hit.  If the weapon process is a direct damage fire spell, it
won't help much the mob is a fire giant.  Finally, some folks hate the
look of some weapons or the animation when swinging them so much they
won't wield them.
