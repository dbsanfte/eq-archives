Heh, lucky you.  With -16 correction and an uncorrected
vision that can't even be measured I've grown very used to
doing many things without bothering to put in my contacts.

Being blind for that time is vastly preferable to the 
immense distortion of image glasses of that power cause
to anything not directly in front of me.  As an example
of how things look, look inside a very relflective, round
bowl.  The way things warp towards the sides, and swirl 
in and out of focus is pretty similar to my vision with 
glasses.

Now, if the really well respected Lasik guy arround 
here would just take care of some more high correction
cases, so I could get an idea of the potential outcome.

My brother had -8 correction, and had his vision corrected
to 20/15 without correction.  The highest correction
I've seen addressed with lasik is -14.  As much as I want
it, I'm just not ready to be a guinea pig.
