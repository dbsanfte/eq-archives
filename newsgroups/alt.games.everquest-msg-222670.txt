It isn't supposed to fully tell you how strong the target is.  It just tells
you relative level (white/black is same level as you, yellow is 1 or 2
higher, red is 3 or more higher, blue is lower (exact range of clue changes
as you go up), light blue is slightly below blue, and green is anything
lower than that, and the message tells you if the thing wants to attack you
or not.

Like players, different mobs of the same level can be quite a bit different
in strength.  A Warrior mob of a given level will usually have a lot more HP
and AC than a Druid mob of the same level.  Which is the tougher opponent,
however, depends on the players.  A Wizard might find the Warrior mob
easier--it's not SOWed and won't snare/root/DOT/nuke.  A Rogue, however,
might find the Druid mob easier...a couple backstabs or so, and it is down.
