Both seem to be down... course I -could- have looked all this up several 
days ago, I simply wasn't interested since I knew where to vote, until 
towards the end reading about all the hardball tactics being used to 
screw up voting, and I got the nagging feeling that I ought to verify.

Then I got pissed cause I couldn't!

The situation here in Lancaster County seems to be the same as you were 
describing in WV; addresses and phone numbers for registrars, good luck 
getting an answer with the phones busier than a radio station's million 
dollar hotline.

Nope, thats just a pointer to
  My Polling Place.com

Hmm, thats slightly different from the two you mentioned, after all, 
lemme go check...

Hey,
http://www.mypollingplace.com/find.php
(which is where the NRA button really took me) is up, lets see.

Bingo:
ST PAULS UCC� � � � � � � � � � � �
50 N MAIN ST

A little sloppy, but thats accurate.  It also gave the times, but didn't 
manage to come up with a sample ballot or information tailored to the 
actual machines in place (just general information about how lever based 
machines work.)

Thats still much much better than anything I managed to hunt up last night:)
