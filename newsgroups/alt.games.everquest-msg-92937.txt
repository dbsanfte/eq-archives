For voice commands sffotware check out www.gamecommander.com

There is a functional demo available that let you use a few single key
commands.

There is a good forum there, and the developers are very good about
answering questions, etc on the forum.

It works in most windows applications, but is mostly feared towards
gamers.
There are 2 or 3 EQ templates available for download as well.
Also game specific boards on the forums. Of which EQ is one.

Also a comparison of Gamecommander to the MS voice thing.
I use Gamecommander and am quite happy with it. I use the mic that
they sell for $12 and it works very well.

Hope that this helps.....
