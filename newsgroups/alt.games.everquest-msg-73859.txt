I have Sol installed and there is a setting for this in the options
section as you are logging in.  On the screen with the "CONNECT"
button click the "OPTIONS"  there's choices for what models to load
and some visiul relted stuff.  All this gets set before you log in.
There is no way to make these changes from in-game.

Hope this helps....
