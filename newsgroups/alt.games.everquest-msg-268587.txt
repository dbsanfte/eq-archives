I haven't played WoW but I have been playing EQ2 since it came out. I'm new 
to these sort of games but I am having great fun with EQ2.

The shear size of the environment is fantastic, simply running around a 
amazingly detailed world is great fun. It's like travelling through a 
fantasy novel. I loved the huge statue of a sword in the Queynos, that is 
amazing as is the voice acting on the NPC's.

I do have problems with EQ2 though.

1. I get the feeling that soloing is going to ber VERY tough. The game seems 
made for groups. Every class has a skill that a group will need at higher 
levels.

I can see a time when the game is dominated by small groups of powerful 
players.

2. Tradeskills, they are hard work!

Apart from that though, it's still a really fun game and i'm enjoying it. I 
would like to see what WoW is like but the UK release is a longway off.
