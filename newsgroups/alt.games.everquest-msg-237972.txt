	You really shouldn't have to go very far or look very hard to find
something the size of god, though.  In the Bible god didn't have much of an
issue with tipping his hand:

	Pharoah: Ha!  You guys are our slaves!
	God: Here, have some locusts.  Oh, and your kids are all dead.
	Pharoah: Um, you can go now.

	Sodom and Gomorrah:  Woohoo!  Party time!
	God: Lot, get out of Dodge...DEFCON 1!  FIRE IN THE HOLE!  CLEAR TO
LAUNCH!
	*BOOM*

	God deployed his nuclear deterrent capability against Sodom and Gomorrah,
but he's leaving Hollywood vertical?

	Someone in one of these debates (in rec.games.frp.misc, IIRC) said: "In
the old days god was found in every sunrise, every bolt of lightning and every
birth.  Now he hides behind event horizons, plays dice with quantum particles
and makes faces at us from before the Big Bang."  Pretty poor showing for an
omnipotent being.
