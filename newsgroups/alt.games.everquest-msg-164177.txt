How'd I earn a place on this list?

If we ever had a spat here, it wasn't even
worth remembering.  Not to me, anyway.

Bingo, thanks for saving me the trouble.

Sheesh, you don't even rise to the level of warranting
a mention at all, son.  My wife and I have more
significant things to talk about, like whether it's
time to change the cat box.

I am reminded of the following exchange in Ayn Rand's
novel "The Fountainhead":

   Ellsworth Toohey has spent a great deal of time
   flaming Howard Roark in his newspaper column.  They
   finally meet in person, and:

   Toohey (belligerently): "Mr. Roark, we're alone
   here. Why don't you tell me what you think of me?
   In any words you wish. No one will hear us."

   Roark:  "But I don't think of you."
