or they'd just need more paying subscribers.

Honestly though, if you are going to charge a subscription fee, for  a
service, it should be up 365 days a year except for brief periods for
patching/maintenence. It doesn't matter if it costs $12.95 a month, or
12 bucks for the entire year. If you charge a fee, you are a
"professional" site and it is time to get professional.

The guy who runs the site with Jelan, gave some input I saw somewhere.
Jelan is currently out of town while they had an IO error on the main
disc or something. So it will be fixed again when he is back.

They really need to hire someone else who can also take care of
things. I mean, they could have 200,000 subscribers at 12 bucks each
and if Jelan got hit by a bus tomorrow and died (yeah, would suck),
we'd only have magelo working until the next patch where SOE
inadvertantly broke it. No one else there can fix or code magelo, I
guess.
