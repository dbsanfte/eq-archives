    I wouldn't suggest it. Replacing BAotR is pretty easy, assuming you're
paying attention and notice it's gone. Getting another Khura's because the
AoE Khura's bounced off your BAotR would be a lot more frustrating. And
there's a fair number of guild clerics that prefer the HPs to the mana regen
on BAotR, especially given how they get the bulk of their mana regen
(TRods).
