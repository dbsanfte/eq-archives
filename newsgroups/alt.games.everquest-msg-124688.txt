well theres always exceptions...   but still I stand by the
more damage != aggro.

If i group with a "non uber" (hate that word) 60 SK, I am doing a **LOT**
more damage, but they can still keep agro off me (unless im using my tunare
stick heh)

When I group with a guildie rogue (Gaunts of dragon slaying-41% haste,
Tunare horn/ Primal poker combo) im sure he does a lot more damage than me,
and I never have problems holding agro (tunare stick or not)

On a raid the other day, a 56 monk in the guild died - hes wielding (i
think) Va'dyns Ulak, and SoM, neither particularly top end weapons.  Im
level 60 (so better damage/skill caps naturally) much better weapons, primal
(way more DPS), ambidexterity (increashed duel wielding) and I didn't get
agro.  Im pretty sure without a doubt, that I massively outdamaged him too.

On the same mob, a 60 monk (using fists/SoM - no proc agro) died whilst I
didn't.. again I have primal, more haste, better damage weapons,
ambidexterity etc.. which does make a pretty big dmage increase

e=mc.. oops wrong one.   damage != aggro
