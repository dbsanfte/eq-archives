....and I died.

Okay, here's the short version. (I'm lying of course.
It's not short. :) ) I'm in a fairly small, non-raiding,
family-type guild. I like it. IIRC, we have five or six
level 65 players and, because of the fundamental nature
of the guild, they are all either clerics or paladins.
One of our clerics had reached the 'Kill Ragefire!!'
part of his epic and made a call to arms. None of our
level 65's were able to make it, for various reasons,
but we had, at a rough estimate, 5-8 chars in the, say,
59-62 range (all of them either clerics or paladins)
another 5-8 of us in the 52-58 level range and, no
matter how we tried to explain that it probably wasn't
a good idea for them, another 5-8 chars ranging from
36 <!!!!!> to the high 40's. (My numbers aren't adding
up, I know, but I'm doing this from memory and who was
or wasn't there and their levels really isn't all that
relevant to my question <which I *will* get to, I promise!>
other than to show that I was neither the highest level
there or the lowest.) We had roughly 25 people there, with,
again, the vast majority being either paladins or clerics.
We were lucky enough to have 3 non-guild 65 level players
come at the last minute, just as we were discussing calling
the whole thing off due to lack of tanking power.

Anyway, that's the situation. Now, I died when Ragefire
was a little under 50% hps. I'm a 53 Halfelf Ranger. I am
not outfitted in uber gear, but I'm not outfitted in total
junk either, IMO. I've spent the last couple of weeks
looking for deals in the bazaar, upgrading as I can, and
spent a fair amount of plat on things. I also spent the
last week before the raid getting my MR and FR up and,
by the time of the raid, I was at 97MR and 99FR unbuffed.
I'm not really good at remember exactly what specific stats
are, but I have been focussing on getting AC and HP stats
on everything possible, so I'm not at the bottom of the
ladder where that's concerned. I really don't think that
that matters all that much because of the people that were
also in that fight who were much younger than me, had much
less MR and FR than I did, and gear that I know is not
significantly better than mine. Maybe a little, but they're
definitely not wearing elemental stuff so the magnitude
of any difference isn't great enough to have made that
difference. Those people didn't die. I did.

So, *finally*, here's my question: Any idea why I would
have died and others didn't? I did what I was told to
do. I got behind him (from my view, I was whacking away
at his tail from the side), I didn't taunt (don't know
if I could taunt aggro away from 3 level 65 tanks beating
on him, but I guess it would have been possible), my
MR and FR seemed to be in the range it should have been,
I wasn't highest level or lowest level there, I don't
think I screwed up in any way.

But, if I *did*, I want to know it. After we had all
regrouped and gotten out of Skyfire, I asked others what
they thought, hoping that if I was being stupid and caused
my own death someone would have seen it and told me so I
wouldn't do it again, and no one seems to have seen me
doing anything I shouldn't have done. One or two made
mention that it could have just been sheer bad luck on
the part of the RNG.

Any other suggestions as to what happened and if it's
preventable in the future? Due to the nature of the
guild, there are going to be LOTS of Ragefire fights
in the future and I wanna make sure I'm not endangering
their chances of succeeding if I participate. If it
will help to be more specific about what I am equipped
with and specific stats, I'll be happy to post them.

(BTW, yes, they killed him just a couple of minutes after
my death and we have another proud owner of their cleric
epic.)

Tracey
