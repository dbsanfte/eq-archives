Cable modem in Nebraska, I go LD on the tribunal server once in a blue
moon, no matter what weird time of the day or night I play on.

In 3 years of 145 days played on my foremost character, I've gone LD
maybe 5 or 6 times. I've died from net LD about 3 times, 2 of those
times actually were server wide LDS which verant acknowledged as their
fault and there was a gm/guide ressing crew.

For as vulnerable as the internet is to problems, this is actually
pretty damn amazing for the time I've spent in the game. If you are
going net LD a lot its:

1) your ISP

2) your system/netcard/cable modem, software configuration, etc

3) a router in your area which is in the direct path between you and
verant, or somewhere along the line of stops on the way to verant.

do stuff like tracert to your server at various times of the day, even
if you are not playing or going to play EQ right then. See where you
have a drop or a problem along the route.

 The best eye opener I had regarding this was while playing UO.
Unlike EQ, the servers were not in one area but all over. Being in
nebraska I could play on the Atlantic or sonoma server and had a
FANTASIC connection with no link death, though they are not really
geographically near me. My friends played on Great Lakes, which was
probably actually closer. I had a horrible ass connection to great
lakes and was LD all the time.  Tracer T showed that it was more hops
away and there were places along the route with dropped packets.
Sonoma, meanwhile, was as smooth as silk and about 7 hops.

If your problem is caused by hops between you and sony/EQ, there is
not much you can do about it but change to an ISP with a different
backbone or possibly move.
