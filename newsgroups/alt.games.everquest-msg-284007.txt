Sony Online Entertainment LLC (SOE), announced EverQuest The Serpent's 
Spine, a new expansion for the Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing 
Game (MMORPG), EverQuest. EverQuest The Serpent's Spine will only be 
available via digital download beginning in September for the suggested 
price of U.S. $29.99.

"In an ongoing commitment to introducing new features into EverQuest, The 
Serpent's Spine introduces the Drakkin, the first new player race since the 
Frogloks were added to the game seven expansions ago," said Chris Sturr, 
Senior Brand Manager, Sony Online Entertainment. "In addition to the new 
race, players of all levels will benefit from this expansion, as we are 
including content for levels 1 to 75."

Players will also be able to explore a new starting city, Crescent Reach, 
which contains merchants, quests and combat. As in the last expansion, there 
will be new dynamic features such as auras, traps and destructible terrain. 
Players will be able to reach level 75 with new spells, raids and abilities.

About EverQuest The Serpent's Spine
Nestled in a great ravine in the Serpent Spine Mountains is an ancient 
abandoned ogre city now called Crescent Reach, which is home to a new race 
born to protect the future of dragon kind, the Drakkin. Six dragons defied 
the council of the ancient dragons of the Nest and chose to create a new 
race to protect their future. The Drakkin are borne of humans touched by a 
dragon's blood and their colors and appearance represent the dragon that 
created them. Rapidly aging and reaching maturity in only months, the 
Drakkin forget their human beginnings and make their pilgrimage to Crescent 
Reach, the home of their dragon creators and the rest of their kind.
