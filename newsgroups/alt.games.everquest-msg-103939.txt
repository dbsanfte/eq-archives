I can add a bit to this.  Scream of Hate is NOT a group
ATK buff like Torrent of Hate.  I bought SoH from Shadowhaven
and have used it solo and in groups.  It does do exactly what
it's supposed to, which is "tap" the mob's ATK rating, and it
last for a LOOOONG time.  What it doesn't do is share that
ATK buff with the rest of your group.

It's pretty much waaay too much mana at th level you
get it (15) for a single-person use.
