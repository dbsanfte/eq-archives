I have a 60 mage, a 60 druid, a 53 necro and a 35 wizzie (shoot have
altitis, with a bunch of others as well).

I'm not sure why people say druids are easy to level.  They are most
definitely not.  It was a pure pain getting my druid up to the fun
stuff, which really only started post 50.  Prior to that you can quad
kite if you are VERY well twinked.  Otherwise, its really slow slow
slow root/rot.  After 50, druids become quite enjoyable. We have the
2nd best nukes, the 2nd best heals, good dots, good buffs, total
freedom of movement, and we can bop all over the place for quests and
trade skills.  Now thats fun.

Wizzies are not fun pre-50 because they spend huge amounts of time
waiting for mana.  Again, in order to quad you need twinkage.  A wiz
is far better off in a group, if any group will have them.

For pure enjoyment and fast leveling to 50, its necro and mage.  They,
of course, end up with role reversals post 55.  So the early thrill
leads to later on bitterness.  Necro and mage populations are among
the lowest high level characters in EQ.

For the basic question, druid vs wizard:  in the high game there is no
question, everyone wants a wiz.  But it reminds me of the classic
tolkien wizard myth...   All wizards are old, because it took them 500
years to achieve their knowledge and power.  Wizards in EQ go through
a nasty apprenticeship that lasts for 59 levels.  After that they are
old and grey with long beards but very very very powerful indeed.
