I can only speak as a cleric since I haven't played any of the other caster
classes yet.  The components you can buy in almost any city.  When you pass
through a city, stock up.  If I was a tank, I'd have at LEAST one stack of
them on me at all times.  Only get the component for the highest symbol your
cleric is likely to be able to cast as they don't stack.

For you at Level 8, that MIGHT be the first symbol spell Transal.  Remember,
the cleric has to be at least the minimum level of the spell to cast it and
the lowest is 14th.  As a cleric I always tended to go into zone where I'd
be the lowest member acceptable and luckily clerics are always in demand.
So unless you commonly group with 14th level clerics and above, don't bother
getting the components unless...

You want a cleric not in your group to cast a symbol spell on you.  How much
you tip is really up to you.  When you do a private tell asking for one
(please don't do this in /say, /ooc, or /shout ... unless you want the
cleric to hate you for making other tanks beg them for symbols as well),
tell them what you're going to pay them for casting it and that you have the
component on you.  Don't offer to "donate" or ask what they'd like to be
paid.  This is a sleazy way to get some weak-willed clerics to give you it
for free.  Basically pay what it is worth to you.  Since you're giving them
the component, all they're expending is mana and mana regen time.  But be
careful not to bug a cleric in a fast-pulling group.  Look for ones in
cities or camping a slow-to-spawn mob(s).  In other words, don't blindly ask
a cleric.  Go and visually see what they're doing then ask.  But as for a
tip.  Hmmm.  For Transal, I'd offer probably 1 pp.  Not sure.  Been a long
time since I was your level and not sure how much 1 pp means to your level.
However, don't give lower coins when they equal a higher coin (i.e., 10 gp
as opposed to 1 pp) as they weigh us down.  Don't give belts or items as
they both weigh us down and take up inventory slots.

Hope that answers your questions.
