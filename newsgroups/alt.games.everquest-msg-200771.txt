Ah, but there's the rub - I have many +mana items.  I think that even
at that level, I only had 2 or 3 items that were less than +100 mana
on them.  Ironically, one of those was my BP - Blessed Full Mithril. 
I have since replaced that one. :)

They've ostensibly removed the soft cap now, so my pool is even
larger.  There was, at one point, a lower limit on the amount of mana
you could gain from +mana items.

Yes, of course, being a cleric I specialise in Alteration, so yes,
heals would cost less.  However, I got tired of pickup groups at level
44 and started killing Happ; this is entirely a nuke fight for a
cleric.  Casting Retribution at that level cost me 6 - 7% of my mana
bar; this means that my pool was about 3900, since I don't specialize
in Evocation (though I do know some clerics who do...*shudder*)
