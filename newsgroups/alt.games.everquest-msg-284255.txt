9) Regurgitonic quest. Take a LORE, NO DROP item from Surefall Glade, and
instead of handing to a woman in West Karana like you're told to, cart it
to the far side of a different continent and hand it to a gnome near the
Ak'Anon zoo who will give you a regurgitonic potion. I have never found
any NPC in game who even hinted that such a trade would be useful. How
did anyone ever discover this? Especially in the "good old days" when
handing items to NPCs who didn't know what to do with the item resulted
in the item being lost forever?
