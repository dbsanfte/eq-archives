Ok, one of us doesn't understand some fundamental game mechanics here.
I'm willing to admit it *could* be me, but anecdotal evidence doesn't
support it. Correct me if I'm misreading you here, but you seem to be
under the impression that if you have a damage shield on, you are immune
to the first hit from a mob? Or are you just saying that you take five
points less damage becasue five points of the damage that would have
been done to you is reflected back on the mob?

If it's the first case, well, I've been hit (and *stunned*, which is the
key issue here) plenty of times by a single shot from a mob with a DS
up. Could I prove it was the *first* time the mob swung at me? Not
hardly. But I also don't think that some crappy low level DS acts like a
very high level skin and totally mitigates even one attack from a mob.
Very unlikely, IMO.

If it's the second case, then I'm even more stymied as to why you think
this is a "Good Thing" (TM). My understanding of damage shields has been
that you still take whatever damage the mob is dishing out, but you make
them pay for by taking "x" points of damage themselves each time they
successfully hit you.  Big whoop. Like five points matters to anything
big enough to hunt when you are level 29. (The minimum level for this
spell.) What it does is increase aggro on you for a melee attack for
each hit. 

Granted, I was thinking in terms of raids and grouping as to why this DS
component sucks so bad, not solo quadding. When quadding, you're the
only one on the Hate list so adding more aggro isn't going to matter. In
that case.. /shrug ... sure, five points is five points I guess, but if
it's not going to stop you from getting stunned or provide some other
benefit, it seems to be (at best) a *very* minor damage enhancer
balanced against a huge PITA for aggro management in groups and raid.

If you're getting hit often enough for 5 points a shot to add up to
anything even *close* to ONE of your AoE nukes, you need to invest in
jboots.

So if that's the only benefit, the huge disadvantages of having the DS
on it for grouping etc. far outweigh any possible advantages for an
extra 5 pts. of damage here and there while quadding.

Oh, that's very unlikely. Knowing me as I do, I'm unlikely to eat my
words even if I'm proven wrong here.
