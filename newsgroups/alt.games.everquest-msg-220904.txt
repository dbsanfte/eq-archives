Ewwww! 

I thought Furor had quit EQ in a huff a couple of months ago?

Even if knights weren't any better at controlling agro than a warrior,
I think they'd still be the preferred tanks for a high end exp group.
A 65 Pally or SK brings enough other things to the table to balance
things out imo. 

I doubt they'll ever nerf hybrid agro control though, the outcry would
be too great because too many classes (basically everyone except
warriors) have a vested interested in the current 100% guaranteed agro
lock . 

I do wish they'd randomize (nerf) hybrid spell agro a bit, knowing
exactly what spells anyone can cast w/o getting agro is just makes too
many things boring for me.

Question is, what incentive do you have to control agro when you can
just get a knight to tank instead? It's not laziness, it's efficiency.
