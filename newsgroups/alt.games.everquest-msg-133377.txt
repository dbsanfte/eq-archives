By 26, I'd already started accumulating them with nothing to do with
them. At 60, I've got about 150 practice points in my pool and no
immediate use for them.

Incidentally, you don't need to spend practice points for them, but if
you haven't kept your 1hs and 1hb maxed, start now. Those two types of
weapons have *much* better ratios than most piercing weapons of
comparable price and difficulty in getting as drops.
