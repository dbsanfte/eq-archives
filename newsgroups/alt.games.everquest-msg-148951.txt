But.. but.. just think of the marketing possibilities!

I can just see it now...

Want to experience the exciting, high-level content in Planes of Power, but
don't have a level 60 character?

For only $50 a month, Everquest is offering you the chance to rent a
fully-loaded 60 level character of your choice!

If you are afraid of dying, DON'T be! Your rented character is specially
coded to never drop below level 60... NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU DIE!

Act now to take advantage of 50k-in-your-bank offer for only an additional
$25!
