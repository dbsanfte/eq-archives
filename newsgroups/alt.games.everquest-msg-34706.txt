*shrug* so guild them all to the same one...problem solved.  Unless your 50+
include an enchanter, cleric, or warrior don't you find it difficult to find
groups?  Of course, if they're a mage, necro and druid and you like to solo,
who cares?

I think the reverse stigma is based on WHICH guild they're in...not that
they're guilded.  I know that on The Rathe if you're a BotS you're seen as
an asshole by many people that have never seen you before.  From the
bitching I've heard about FoH on whatever server they're on it's the same
thing.  Luckily on Zeb (Rathe/E'Ci split) we don't have any "universally"
hated uberguilds yet.
