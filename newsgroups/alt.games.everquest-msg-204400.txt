Maybe you should not try to sound so stupid.  So my mana bar should never go 
down huh?  That would require never casting a spell.  Geez are you really this 
stupid in person?  For starters I've never asked these spells to be cast on 
me.  Each time I've gotten them it was for helping out someone first.  I've 
never required one of these spells so I don't use them as a crutch and my mana 
never runs out.  Boy don't you looks stupid now, but then you're probably used 
to it.
