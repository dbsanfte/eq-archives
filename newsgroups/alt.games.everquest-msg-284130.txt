In what should prove to be a vain attempt to turn this thread back into an 
EQ discussion, I've always had a question about this that maybe someone here 
could answer.

Whenever I've done this for folks in the past, it was with the druid.  Since 
the majority of the people I game with are in the 65 - 70 range, it didn't 
really matter who you got to help you out ... we could've just as easily 
actually done the mission as lent out names to fill the group for the 
soloer.

Let's say for supposition's sake I have a level 20 necro, and I'd like to 
get a LDoN for myself.  Do the other two people I enlist need to be of the 
same level range, or will any two warm bodies 17 - 70 do?
