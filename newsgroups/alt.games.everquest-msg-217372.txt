    Ah, vanity AA's! ;-) Yeah, the rest of the AA's looked to be a puller
profile, just not those two.

    One of our monks (who was slanted DPS over defensive) had a ton of AA's
saved up in case they were used in melee rebalancing in LDoN, and when he
heard there would be no new AA's in the expansion he dumped them all in Crit
Mend. He's swearing by it now, saying it helps him live when pulling a lot.
I don't know whether that's because the percent chance to go off is so good
at level 3 or what, but he loves it and he didn't think he would.

    Water is likely a place to leave alone in the short-term while you gear
up. Everything there is annoying. All the Avatars except Dust (the one at
the top with the spiders) should be a breeze to do, as should all the Earth
rings save Dust. Fire is a good loot zone, and even after being enhanced a
lot of the mobs there are quite doable. You'd also be able to put to use a
lot of the stuff that more senior guilds pass over there (Druav and the two
charm chickens).
