The swatches go for a lot more than that typically now that Master
Wu's Armor can be made.  Before the installation of these pieces the
swatches typically went for 1pp per swatch, with those who REALLY
wanted them paying 2pp.  Now with the Master Wu's stuff in the game I
have trouble getting sellers at 30pp per stack because others are
paying 50 to 60pp per stack.  I have even seen 100pp per stack offered
a couple of times on MT.

They are a great money maker.  Even the Silk Threads are a good money
maker now that Fine Plate is in the game.  Although not to the degree
that Swatches are, but it is not uncommon to see 1pp per thread.
