Their entire premise is disgusting, the legal threats are just the
frosting on the cow pie.  Anyone want to donate to a legal fund to take
blacksnow to court for infringing on the rights of on line gamers? 
Seems they are pretty smug about the power of the nuisance suit, might
be time to fight fire with fire.  The greed these folks exhibit  is
disgusting and for them to  have the nerve to say on their site that
they do this to preserve the rights of gimps to be sucessful in games
makes me want to vomit.
