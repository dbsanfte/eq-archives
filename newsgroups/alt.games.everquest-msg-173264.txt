I found out kind of on accident that if I cast a nuke on the Soulbinder that
nothing happens but my skill goes up anyway.  I did this with my level 9
(WOOT!) Wizard.  I was gonna see how many bodies I could pile up at her feet
just for fun, but when I cast on her it didn't bother her one bit.  (It's
kind of nice to see that some NPC's aren't so crabby)

Anyway, is this considered an exploit?  Did everyone already know this but
me?
