As many have noted, PLing post-40 really shouldn't be considered (or is
difficult to do so) PLing.  It's more like grouping (which isn't always bad
for some classes that should probably actually group around this level).
However, there is hope.

Bard:

-- Wears as high of AC armor she can equipt (not, just AC, STA is nice)

Druid:

-- Wears Fungi Tunic
-- Has Manastone
-- Level 57+ (for Nature Skin, while SLN is nice, Nature Skin is better)


Both:

-- Go to Lfay, Druid normal PLing buffs onto your Bard and Regrowth on
him/her and you kill some Brownie Guards/Merchants


Tis the only decent "PLing" type scheme I can come up with, or rather, it's
easy enough to do with a Warrior... but, thats a Warrior (might I mention in
Cobalt?).  :)
