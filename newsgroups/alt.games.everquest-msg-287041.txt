easy way to get Runescape Money
The following are some tips to earn some easy runescape money:

(1) Through mining

-PART 1-
Get your mining level to lv115 1st,
If your going for the easy way,
Get your mining level to 60 (mine only irons)
You'll have about 7822 iron ores
You can sell your iron ores for 100 runescape gp each and that'll earn
you around  770k-800k

-PART 2-
If you're going for the tougher task,
Like in part 1,get your mining to 15 but after 30 start to mine coals
>From my calculation:
The iron ores between level 15-30 + coals between lv30-60 will let u
make this  amount : 780k to 950k (If u sell the iron ores for 100gp
each and coal for 150- 180gp each)

Notes: Remember to change your pickaxe whenever the requirements hits,
this'll  help a lot as the speed for getting ores will be faster..
Notes: As you get to level 60 mining, you can go ahead n proceed to
the mining  guild to get more ores...
Notes: Smithing wont be so much of earning when it's below 70, after
70 you can  make more then 20k at once easily...

-PART 3-
You can also earn easy runescape money through ores but u need
starting money,  just around 100k will do..
All u have to do is to buy coal(example) 100-120gp each from people
and sell it  at a higher price (example:150gp each for 1-500 coals,
180gp each if u have tons  of coals)

(2)Through Magic

-PART 1-
The best way for making runescape money in magic perhaps is through
runecrafting...
The higher the level of runecrafting, the more money you'll obtain...
For starters: The Best way is to runecraft air runes...
Air altar is located outside south of the entrance to falador and a
bank is near.
You can try to sell the air runes for 15-20gp each which most of the
rich guy buy  them at...
-PART 2 & PART 3-(Tips tat need a lot of money)
2nd way is to get a capital of at least 220k..
All u need to do is stay in the runes shop and buy runes
Buy chaos and death runes and proceed to world with a larger
population to sell  your runes (chaos 120-150gp each, death-260-300gp
each)
REQUIREMENTS FOR PART 3: Level 55 magic level
This tip also requires money because you'll be buying rune med for
high level  alchemy
Buy rune med from player 10k each and nature rune 200-300gp each
After high level alchemy you'll obtain 11520gp,you will get 1220 or
1320gp more  profit for each high level alchemy...

(3)Through woodcutting
-PART 1-
Woodcutting is perhaps the easiest money earning skills to train on.
All you need is chop till your woodcutting gets higher than 60.
Once u reach level 60-woodcutting, you'll have like 4056
willows...sell them for  30gp each n you'll get between 120k -122k of
cash.
At level 60 woodcutting, you can start to woodcutting yews but it'll
be quite  slow so u need to put in some effort to get yr woodcutting
level higher for  faster yew logs.
Sell your yew logs between these ranges: 300-375gp each
-PART 2-
Again, this part is about Merchanting.
All you need is money of 250k or more.
Buy yews from other players at 250gp each and sell others for more
like 300-375gp  each
-PART 3-
If u happens to be a member, it'll be great for you.
You can fletch your logs to make more money.
When u can fletch yew logs, try to high level alchemy them you'll gain
quite a  big amount of runescape money rather than selling them to
shops.
