Sure, we could say raid a = 5 dkp for attendance, raid b = 7 dkp for
attendance (guessing the length of the raid).  But the idea is to score
peoples commitment, with a block of dkp someone could turn up for the final
kill and still recieve full DKP.  The way around this is to recieve no DKP
if you are not there at the start of the raid, which I feel is unfair to
people in different timezones etc.

This is a hybrid guild not a full on raiding guild or a laid back family
guild.

Yep, valid points, a pure double bid system does seem better overall, I
guess its a waste of time looking for a perfect system, perfect things are
rare to find :)
