There's some info at :
http://www.AllianceofMagic.com
- Look in the Tips area for the message posted about XP Bonus. - There's a
downloadable Excel spreadsheet there currently but I'm working on a
completely browsable map of Norrath which will include the levels, mobs,
items, etc., - This should let you click on a place, see what's there,
quests included, and then basically do something similar to Mapquest.com
where you can select a starting zone, and a destination and have it bring up
all of the related information allowing you to easily print it all from one
page.
