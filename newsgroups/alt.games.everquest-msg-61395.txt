Yeah, I hit 11 on my necro, didn't crash but had a funky graphical bug that
screwed up a chunk of my screen when I tried to go into inventory, hit 12 on
my necro, crashed.

Later that day, hit 32 on my druid, crash, but this was like the 30th time I
had crashed in an hour, I went with my guild to Mistmoore and just kept
crashing and crashing, pissed me the hell off.
