What about us.. Dwarven warriors? We're the finest of all.. small but a
fierce race we are! I wouldn't dream of being any other warrior race... bah
and by the way... we don't need those magic tricks.. Just place yer axe in
one of them orcs necks and ya'll feel fine for the day.

Don't let stats get in yer way of choosing a race to pick.. choose the one
ya like best, just some dwarven advice, lad.

Greetings, Gimlor
Level 18 Dwarven Warrior
