I've recently done 2 fresh EQ installs - on both of them the patcher
would freeze intermittently.  One got it's internet connection through
the DSL modem in an XP Pro machine, the other via a linksys to a 
cable modem.  On the second machine I finally got a the final 25
mintutes of patch download to occur without a freeze by stopping all
internet access from the other machines.  However, now that the big 
initial patch is  done, none of my 3 machines, nor the 3 machines at
my friend's house have problems patching and entering the game.
