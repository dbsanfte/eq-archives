In Maru Seru, guards will fight lightcrawlers and zelniaks. The desert
guys will fight lightcrawlers and zelniaks too.

In DSP, the rockhoppers will aggro on the smugglers and the cave guys
(down by ME). The Sanctus Seru guards don't fight anything. I did
notice that a bloodstarved wolf did aggro one of the npcs in the house
between the rockhoppers and Maiden's Eye tunnel, fyi.

In Echo Caverns, the bulk of the mobs on the Deep side will start to go
LB around late 40s or so. There is a group of four underbulks who are
mostly lower level on a lower level (down an elevator) that the guards
will fight. The guards and miners will aggro the underbulks and fungal
fiend (looking mobs), but you have to be patient. It takes a while
(probably just a few seconds, but they might seem very long seconds)
for them to notice. Never took a stonegrabber to the guards (no need),
but they drop fairly nice plat consistently. I used to train the two
named to the guards (thought the named were too tough for me). It's
been awhile so I don't know if anythings been changed.
