ok here is what i know but i dont think its gonna work for you but here 
gose. Go to rathe mountains there is a troll camp there killing them 
will give you good faction with upper froggies and bad with the lower 
dead. But like i said not sure if it would work for you being you might 
take hits killing the trolls that would be bad for faction with them and 
ogres but kill one and check out the hit and see.
