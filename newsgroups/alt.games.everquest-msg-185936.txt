Actually, two corrections.

Dwarves, even those who follow Rallos Zek, are race restricted from wearing
Fierce Heraldic armor.

 Helenic Tundra armor is even better than Fierce heraldic.  It is almost the
same stats, but has stamina in almost all slots, in addition to roughly
equal hit points.  The only reason it is not more popular is because of the
extremely restrictive race/diety combination on it.   Only Tribunal
worshiping Barbarian warriors can wear it.

All dwarven racial armors run heavily towards wisdom bonuses, since all
dwarves are clerics, dontchaknow?
