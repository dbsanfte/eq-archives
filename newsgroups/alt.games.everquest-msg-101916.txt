To take it a little further, "sow please" is still kinda rude. 
Basically you're putting the SoW'er in the position of either having
to refuse you
or SoW you.

I prefer in this order,

"Could I get a SoW, please?"
"If you have some spare mana and aren't busy, could I get a SoW?"
"Could I trouble you for a SoW in trade for a couple of plat?" (or
breeze, or buff du jour)

Of course you can start getting a bit carried away...  to the point
where you see RP'ers:

"Good druid, I observe that you are not actively engaged in battle at
the moment.  Could I trouble you for a moment to imbue upon me the
Wolf's Spirit?  It would be much appreciated, as I must soon do battle
with an angry giant."

After the imbuing, "Thank you, good druid.  May Tunare's blessings be
upon your soul."

I have never seen that, lol.  75% say, "could I get a sow please?"
which is fine.
About 20% "sow plz", bleh, and 5% with something else.
