<bzzzt> sorry, thanks for playing.

The bottom line is that usenet has degeneratted into a haven for
idiots who wont take the time to either:

A.  Read the DAY's contents (let alone read a weeks worth) before
posting their question (that has been asked and answered a million
times before)

B.  Spend 5 minutes doing ANY kind of research on their own before
posting a query (that's often been asked and answered a million times
before.)

How can you have respect for people like that?  They are USING you.

Think about it for a second, what POSSIBLE motives could people have
for sitting and responding to queries all day, over and over again.
Boredom and altruism can only go so far.

There is a VERY small subset of people who will answer questions on a
topic they are informed about.  It is the Usenet community's DUTY to
appreciate the work those people do, and in any way they are able,
offload the barrage that such people are exposed to.  Deja is just one
of a few ways that this can be accomplished.  

I'm sure both Bizbee and Lokari could give you an extensive list of
valued posters who dont bother with AGEQ any more because, quite
frankly there is VERY little useful information here, and the
questions posed are pedantic, rude and written in a tongue that could
only ASPIRE to doodspeak.  The typical responses sink to a level below
childishness.

And you can put that in your FAQ.
