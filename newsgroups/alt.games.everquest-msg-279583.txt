Your average raider seldom groups outside his guild at all, and even
more rarely groups outside of a handful of similarly situated guilds.

Your average non-raider seldom groups with those referenced (but groups far
more often because that's what he does).

No amount of equipment would change that.

The amusing thing is, when the two *do* cross paths we often see the fallout
on message boards and on this very newsgroup.  Raiders don't play by the
same rules.  Nothing is an upgrade, so "need before greed" is never even
considered, among other differences.  And then somebody comes and whines
that they got screwed by those greedy "ubers".  Duh, they never even
considered the possibility that you were being screwed.  =P

That's generally how I end up with groups, but it's the curse of the DPS
classes that it's also how I usually miss groups.  "First available" when
competing with the largest segment of the EQ population isn't much.  =)

Creators are dominant because they are simple.  They are by no means the
easiest missions (which amuses me).  They are, however, one of the better
exp-gaining missions, as well as a good return on crystals vs. time spent. 
DoN is some of the best single-group content in the game, but it fails to
relieve my boredom with grinding because everyone gravitates to the path of
least resistance.

I know of one mission that can be done in 15 minutes by any group with a
rogue (or an insane monk...).  I almost never hear of anyone doing it
though.

I can't grind anything and tell you it's fun.  That's why I'm a raider and
have only the *necessary* AAs for what I do.  =P

Interestingly enough, the non-raiders *do* get extra slots to cram
group-gear into.  3 slots per LDoN piece, 2 slots per DoN piece.

> 	How many DoN augs are you wearing today?

I think I mentioned elsewhere in this discussion that I've got about a dozen
DoN augments, including my weapons.  About 10 of the +hp augs.

Raid-acquired augments generally aren't "cheap", though they are a lasting
upgrade so in the long run are worth the dkp, and I don't grind enough to
have the single-group augs from RS, etc.

My pocket cleric and pocket shaman, both of which I could play in a "raider"
group, both of which could *gain* quite a lot by getting outfitted in DoN
gear (and will eventually, at my slow grinding pace, now that I have all the
augs I want and can stop stealing theirs), beg to differ.

Time is now a 3-year-old raiding zone.  You appear to keep trying to set
arbitrary limits on the discussion, restraining it to only what you are
familiar with.

Only a few of them were ever all that useful (and those have mostly been
obsoleted by game mechanics, as it was the clicky effects that made them
useful, e.g., magician insta-invis boots).  But revamping them removes them
from the (few) true low levels.

Which explains why my guild doesn't do NToV anymore, but hardly explains why
any non-raider group wouldn't go to someplace with rather decent upgrades.

*Almost* anyone with epic 1.5 or 2.0 plans stuff.  They must, because nobody
is gonna do it for them.  Though you're correct in the grand scheme of
things.

That's another issue entirely.  The skills are important, the perception is
important, the personality is important, the drive is important, etc. 
"Leaders" are a fairly rare commodity in the world, and in the game.

It is after you've run your 10th Carprin raid where every single piece of
loot rots, but have no choice because it *must* be done.

The pouch is "freaking necessary" and actually prevents me from getting
another 100 hp, 40 AC, etc., from an actual range slot item such as all the
other melees use.  Yeah, I could switch out, but I'm a *puller* so I make
that decision to stay always ready to throw.

Even *at* the Time level, it will prevent your monks from getting better
upgrades in the range slot in the same damn zone.

I'll repeat what the wise white rapper said, "Where it is usually depends on
where you start."

Well sure, so would I, but then I've often wondered how people can play this
game for years and years without ever raiding for the exact same reason. 
Obviously it works for some people.

Yes!  So why not raid?!?  If you're going to put in the time necessary to
stay mildly competitive, why would anyone choose to not raid?  The rewards
are better, nobody is going to argue that.  It's a helluva lot more fun than
yet another LDoN/DoN.  And to stay competitive will require as much time
investment as it takes to be a raider.  Truly, I've never understood why
such a complaint exists because the option is there for anyone in such a
position that they might have a right to complain.

Though if nothing else, this discussion has illustrated that "vastly" is
subjective.  =)

It should.  Fear, for instance, is easier than the Creator mission.  It
requires a certain group makeup (which doesn't generally include monk... 
I've still only got 3 of the single-group trials done), which of course
requires thought and planning.

Of course not, that's why you enlist 5 other people, who all need the same

WoS (hard side) requires a 7k, buffed, tank.  I know because I've done it
with a 6500 hp tank, me running the cleric, and it was brutal.  DoN mission
mobs are generally similar in damage output, so the requirement shouldn't
change much.  RCoD is actually a fair bit easier.  PG you could get by with
an 8k tank if you had a shaman slowing and covering some heals, 9k to be
"easy".  You really want a full 10k hp tank for RS I'd imagine, and of
course more is better.  But the quality of play, particularly from a slower
and healer when considering RS, is equally if not more important.  I've
duoed there, as the tanking part of the duo, with only enough buffs to put
me at 10k...  it hurt, a lot, but it was doable.  I've also wiped on a
single, non-named mob with a full group of "ubers" including a 16k tank.  =P

Well, we do share that opinion then.  =)

That was the nerf.  Now it's more like a craptacular 180.  =P

Another double-edged sword.  A haste aug means I lose an aug slot's worth of
hp.  =)  I could run tribute haste even, but since I'm already running
tribute +atk to attempt to keep my rather sad atk up it would get expensive.

Interesting side point.  I'd place bets that every monk in your guild has
better atk than me.  I'm built for pulling above all else, it just so
happens to also make me an almost acceptable tank-alternative.  I maxed out
atk for like 2 days back when I was raiding Time and it's been dropping
ever since.
