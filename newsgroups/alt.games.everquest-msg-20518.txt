1) The bash test was done at level 45.   The kick test was done at level 48.

Offense does not increase between 40 (or 41?) and 50.   For the kick
comparison, you're attacking mobs that are at least 3 levels higher with the
same attack skills. (assuming all tests were done on low blues.   We'll get to
that part next.)

2) There is absolutely no indication of what was being fought.  For all  I
know you were fighting low low blues in Overthere at 45 (or farming the greens
in Mistmoore for drops) while the 48 sample included 3 planes raids and a load
of white/yellow hunting in Skyfire.   Even between two mobs of the same level,
some have greatly improved defensive abilites, relative to others.   A Sarnak
caster is a lot easier to smack than a wurm.

3) Why the apples to oranges comparison?   If the headings on the sides are at
all accurate, you did well over 1,000 kicks, yet only 200 bashes.

4)  The 30 damage column in bash.   I'd assume those are the criticals.
Where are the critical hits with the kicks though, or are you honestly going
to try and tell me that over 1000 kicks, you didn't get any?  Or claim they
all fell into the 17 damage catagory?   (Don't need a log on hand to remember
28 to 30 damage critical kicks, and not all that rarely.)   Or did you once
more do an apples to oranges comparison, and cut out the criticals from the
Kick chart, while including them in the Bash chart?   Do you even know, are
these your charts as you claim?  Considering they were made with different
programs in different styles...

All in all, it's enough to make me doubt your statistics when you claim
something that seems so off... that over 40 percent of my hits are doing 1
damage, (almost every other hit) and that it's more than twice as common for
me than the next most common number coming up.

Have I kept logs?  No.  I never claimed that I did.   Nor have I claimed that
I "mentally parse battlespam using only your brain and your eyeballs".   In
fact, I haven't really been paying much attention to it at all, since
succesfully landing the kick for taunt value is all thats really important,
and neither kick nor bash will ever be a significant part of my damage.

All I said was that your numbers seem wrong, and your pretty little charts
neither impress me, nor are convincing evidence on thier own.

statistics."  - Mark Twain
