Hmm, what are these "caps" of which you speak?  Having faithfully ignored the
line since my teens, I'm not familiar with the caps, but I haven't seen them
listed anywhere to my knowledge.  You give me the relevant ones right there, of
course, but what about for lower level chanters/clerics?

I also have Wake of Tranquility as a cleric.  Still haven't bothered trying to
work out how to use this line.

I'm really starting to wonder whats up with that, from a psychological
standpoint, I'm normally so eager to explore new spells and spell lines.  Have I
been conditioned to avoid this one like the plague?

In a hurry?  Getting a trade skill to 250 "in a hurry?"  Perhaps next you'll
tell me that one good way to get an ariel view of Des Moines in a hurry would be
to put together another Apollo mission and set up a polariod on a tripod on the
moon.

Me too, except I'd root and atone... Atone being the one part of the Lull line
that worked reliably.
