Need to specify which Halloween event.  The one last year with
werewolves running around was nice. 


The one two(three?) years ago, where Kithicor was ruined as a hunting
zone, undead suddenly spawned who could kill anyone at the time (max
level was still 50), and at the end of the script, every player in the
zone was DeathTouched(tm); well, that one was less than fun.
