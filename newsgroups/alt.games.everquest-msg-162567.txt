  Left-handed track baller here.  I also use a mouse at work, but only
because I have to.  I love not having to drag a stupid mouse all over
the place.  I have a Logitech trackball... it has a nice big ball that I
can move with easily with one finger.  Very nice, and it's lasted so
long that the name printed on it has worn away.  Lenny bought the same
kind for his computer on my recommendation, and he's happy with it too.

Annie <--- Does NOT want to hear any cracks about "fingering balls" now.
