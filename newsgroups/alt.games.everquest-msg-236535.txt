Uhm...it sounds like you just said you are going to play a Warrior to 65 in
order to earn money to twink a Mage or Necro.  Considering that Warriors are
one of the most group-dependent classes, and also one of the most
equipment-dependent (and so often have to spend all their money equipping
themselves), wouldn't it make more sense to do the Mage or Necro first?
