Thanks for that clear explanation. I wonder if anyone has cataloged 
estimated (or actual) Mob ATKs. It could dramatically affect equipment 
choices... in some cases.

It appears to be about as scientific as the 'rule of thumb' too. :)

(Though that doesn't make it a bad maxim.)

Clearly if we knew what the atk of the mobs in question was we could 
fine tune our armour for optimal results. I'm not thinking in terms of 
balancing hp to ac... but rather... max hp and soft ac cap = best 
healing efficiency for the healers. Or hitting the soft ac cap and then 
switching to resist gear could prove much more practical... even for 
main tanks.

Or perhaps if some raid targets have such insane atk that no amount of 
player AC can reach it then discarding AC entirely and going for raw hp, 
regen, resists, right click abilities, etc might be more efficient.

Its a shame really that EQ is as simplistic as it is. A more complicated 
system would be much more fun to optimize in. :)
