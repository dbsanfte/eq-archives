There is another route, if you so desire. However, it does
involve...dirtying your hands a little.

Kill the explorers (from Firiona Vie) in their hovel in LOIO. Smash their
fragile little elf and barbarian skulls in. Keep any explorer knives they
happen to have on them, and turn them in to a Trooper (whose name I can
never remember) who stands at the line of pillars halfway between the lake
and Cabilis.

Much better faction hits, but you'll wreck your Firiona Vie, Kelethin and
Kaladim faction while you're at it....
