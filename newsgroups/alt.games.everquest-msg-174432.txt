Are you HoH flagged?
Also remember im 65 compare to your 62, which will add to the dps difference
(however slim that may be..)

All my guilds rangers got a primal bow when we were back into ST in a big
way, so I guess upgrades for them are different to upgrades for your guild?
Its fairly common for them to have AoW and primal bows (and in some cases,
PoP/SoL bows too).. but thats because we got too many fucking bows.  AoW
dropped like 5 bows to every 1 other item, they went FFA to the zone and to
twinks

That wasn't my average DPS though, that was just the ones at the end of the
file (ie the highest).. not positive what all buffs I had for each of these
fights, or if there were a ton of "cannot see target" etc, but it was all in
the same general area, with the same group pretty much.

Also, since this I've been nerfed again (Wu's) and from figures told to me,
that was accounting for something like 10-15dps

Well with command of druzzil chanters are getting out of control (700
hitting pets, who don't take exp if you do a point of damage)
I fought the same target as a DC pet in kael before (me unbuffed), and in
the 4 mobs, I got exp all 4 times.

I was watching a friend using his bow yesterday, and archery seems kinda
slow (its not continous like my melee anyway).. so if you step to the side
you don't miss a turn..  just doesn't seem a big deal, for the ability to do
such massive dps.
