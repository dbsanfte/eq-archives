I saw the ruckus they raised, but I think they're
nuts.

8.5 second Complete Heals would help, of course,
but it hardly "trivializes" any encounters.  Even
used optimally, 15% faster CHeals doesn't make *that*
much of a difference (e.g. bring 6 Clerics instead
of 5, and you've got a *bigger* bang for the buck
than cutting CHeal time by 15% would).  Plus,
faster CHeals will be harder to "rotate" without
getting out of sequence on ubermob raids, *and*
it means that the clerics will be going OOM faster.
It's a mixed blessing.

I'm getting pretty tired of how quick some folks
are to make the "trivializes" claim, it seems
that damned near every change to the game causes
someone to scream that things will be "trivial" now.
Funny, nothing feels "trivial" to me in the game yet.

What's ironic is that the FoH rant starts out
with the guy screeching:

   Verant Remove Mage Summoned Focus Items 
   From the game before it's too goddamn late.
   You obviously did little to no testing to see 
   what the impact of these items would be to the game 

...and yet the whiner himself obviously hadn't 
waited to test the new focus items in actual 
battles before he starts screaming, "trivialize,
trivialize!"  (How do I know he didn't wait?
Because he posted his rant THE DAY BEFORE THE 
FOCUS ITEMS EVEN WENT LIVE.)

A later post on that same FoH thread puts
it bluntly:

   "The fact that you're removing Tormax loot
   for these items tells me one thing: 
   Tormax loot SUCKS. It's worthless shit that 
   doesn't help you as a caster at all. What, 
   AC? HP? Enough extra mana to cast See Invis 
   twice?  You call that high end loot?"

It also shows where the guy's *real* concern
is -- heaven forbid anyone else should be
able to get upgrades to their spellcasting
without being in his uberguild...

Finally, after having read the enter FoH
rant thread from start to finish, I have
come to the conclusion that FoH seems to have
as a requirement for admission that the
member be an arrogant, obnoxious, angry, 
elitist, foul-mouthed fourteen-year-old.

(Check out their "current news" items 
on their http://www.fohguild.org website,
which contains a boggling proportion of
obscenities, masturbation jokes, sniggering
references to "retarded hermaphrodites",
"buttocks", "homosexual midgets", "cockblocking",
etc., and not one, not two, but about a dozen
crudely-drawn graffiti-style penises.  In
short, it's like revisiting junior high school
again.)

In the focus-item rant thread alone,
I've never seen so much gratuitous
obscenity, nor such frequent accusations
that anyone who disagrees with the poster
must be, quote, "retarded".  The icing on the cake
was this ugly little rant from the aptly
named "Furor", the "leader" of FoH:

    Kreugen and several others have pointed
    out the obvious problems with most of
    the mental defecient's flames/thoughts
    on this subject so that saves me some
    time from having to rehash the same crap
    that doesn't seem to get into your peanuts. 

    Lastly, I'm going to go ahead and allow
    the fucktards that wasted my time, my
    guild's time, and the time of intelligent,
    thinking humans everwhere, the chance to
    apologize for their behavior in this thread.
    You being allowed to browse this board isn't
    your right, its a fucking priviledge. We have
    a very gracious ISP who allows us to run this
    site and its tremendous bandwidth requirements
    in the manner that it's run saving the visitors
    of this site the ugly, retarded interface of
    EZBoard and the annoying and intrusive popup
    adds that you see everywhere else. You apologize
    now and you will be allowed to post constructively
    and even flame when the thread calls for 
    it - don't and you won't even be able to see
    the front end. Save me the time from having
    to go through this thread and ban your ass.
    Step up and admit what a degenerate you are....

I saw *no* posts that were so out of line as 
would require such a response.  Apparently,
"Furor's" big problem is that his ego can't
brook any disagreement without going ballistic,
labeling dissenters as "fucktards" who "waste
his time".

FoH even created a special forum on their
site entitled "Retard Rickshaw", to which they
move posts in other forums that they choose
to label as stupid and single out for ridicule.

Thank god these brats aren't on *my* server.
My sincere condolences to the good folks on
the Veeshan server who have to put up with them.
