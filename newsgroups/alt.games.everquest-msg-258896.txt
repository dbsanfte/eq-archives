Sure, assuming by "/track" you mean "/doability x" where x is the
number for track.  Same with "/forage".  I have never done this but I
know people who do, sans the tracking spam.  (They use an autofire
program to continuously hit forage while AFK and autoinv what they
forage).  I would just suggest you need to find the correct delay
since there may be one between when you forage and when it appears on
your cursor.  But you know all that.
