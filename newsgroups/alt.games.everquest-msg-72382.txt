I hate to burst your bubble, but 52 and 53 are slightly worse than 51.
When you hit 54, you'll think your exp bar is broken, and they get
slightly worse ever level up through 58.  Hitting 59 makes all those
other hell levels look trivial.  I did 2 hours in Velks Lab village
last night, clearing all dogs and 2 gargoyles per cycle (my best is
clearing all 4 gargs) with a mid-50s group and barely got one blue
bubble.  Of course that's more experience than I've made in the past
week, so I wasn't complaining too much.  
The Hole is good exp, and one of the better dungeons around.  It's too
bad that it's in the ass-end of nowhere, and that there is almost no
chance of a pick-up group there, but with you and Tiru I would think
you would get decent exp just clearing the ent mobs.  If you had
someone to haste you/clarity Tiru it would really fly.
