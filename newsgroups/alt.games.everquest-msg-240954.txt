Probably... for a week or two; it would be fun to see new stuff and
see the big targets go down, and be a part of it. That is fun...until
they realize the jokes they've made about Afterlifers being no-lifers
is true and promptly deguild, unless of course they get to be in an
uberguild without the raid attendance and other requirements that suck
all the fun out of playing.  The ex-Afterlife friend I mentioned can
attest to that... (but of course he was "hardcore" enough to get into
AL in the first place... no freebie instatag dealie.. and he burnt out
after a couple months... he wasn't allowed to play his main because
they wanted his Cleric on raids, he was required to show up at the
drop of a hat,  he was required to dedicate ridiculous amounts of time
to the guild, and he wasn't allowed to have much say in what went on,
or where it went on... )

He still plays EQ, has 3 PCs and 5 accounts to play it... so he's
still into it in a huge way... but he found being among the 'best of
the best' is about as fun as a root canal.

To each their own... some people really enjoy being part of something
like that, it satisfies some unfullfilled need in their lives i guess.
But its not the 'point of the game'... hell most of wouldn't even
think its even 'fun'. Its 'extreme'... and about as much fun as being
the guy who farms spiderling silks to buy a horse before level 6. Its
an equivalent feat really.

ROFL... 

I said I "Had a friend in Afterlife"... I meant "I have friend who was
in afterlife"... not "I had a friend, now he's in afterlife." Perhaps
you've lost too many friends to uberguilds to see the other
interpretation. ;p

He did indeed /guildremove... and created his own guild. Is it a
lessor guild? Depends on what criteria you measure... its a hell of a
lot more fun than Afterlife was... so I'd say it was a far superior
guild.

Sure. So what. That didn't make him a better player; we knew it, and
he knew it. It isn't the point of the game, unless you've set that
goal for yourself, and the only reason you'd do that is because your
uncreative enough to see the world of possibility of fun things you
could be doing with your time.

Duh.

It would take a period of adjustment yes. But seriously, you put a
Time Guild into my gear and they'll take a while to adjust too. They'd
have the advantage of adjusting faster because my gear would be a
memory to them, but they would still need to relearn before they were
as competent as me with it.

And yes, 'my guild' would have to figure out the tactics, and
capabilities of our new gear, while fighting the targets, vs just
having to remember and re-apply them. It would take a little longer...
but no longer than it did for the original owners of the gear to
figure it out. They aren't better players, they just have more
experience.

This isn't like dropping me into a IRL Ferrari;  I am not going to
deliver pro laptimes because those guys *are* better drivers, I'll
improve to a point, but it will (likely) stop well short of Shumacher
and crowd.

 Drop me into Post-Time Gear and Guild, and I'll ramp up just fine
with a bit of time to adjust.

I'm well aware of the Council strategies actually. Its certainly more
complicated and involved than a Vox raid (complicated enough that its
one of the raids I would cite as being impossible to effectively
mass-macro-bot). But your idea that  'I  (or anyone else) couldn't
fathom the tactics' is sheer arrogant fantasy. 

EQ isn't *that* complicated; to encounter it for the first time, yes
you'd wipe and wipe badly, a number of times... but as you said these
events are about banging your head against the wall until it breaks...
its an apt metaphor... great intelligence isn't required... merely a
high tolerance for pain.

And fwiw... perma mezzing *anything* for 3 straight hours is on par
with with watching paint dry for 'fun'.

Of course not. I won't argue that point. I'd be a fool :)
You'd need a basis of experience, several months of good grouping and
raiding experience... but a *lot* of it is transferrable from
character to character... and if you've got the basics you change
characters and ramp up pretty quick.

A guild, any guild, should cater to the needs and wants of its members
to progress and have fun. After all...what on earth else is there for
a guild to cater to? A guild is nothing more than the collection of
members... if a few of them *want* to slum around in the plane of fear
instead of attending a regular raid... that's a good enough reason for
me.

I've seen it from the inside of Afterlife 2nd hand. And first hand
from the inside of several 'lessor guilds' as you call them. Its not
for me.

And I object strongly to anyone suggesting that I'm jealous of what
their lives are like :). I'm more envious of the level 6 who's
fighting bixie drones working on his newbie armour and having the time
of his life, seeing something new everytime he crests a hill than I
will ever be of anyone in an uberguild.

The object of the game in EQ is to have fun. If being in an uberguild
is what turns your crank go for it... but your simply indulging in a
fantasy if you truly think the tiny demographic that plays 'that way'
are somehow getting more out of EQ than me, or even represents what
the majority of players actually wish they were doing.

They'd all like to take out Quarm sure... but far far far far fewer
would like to do it under the conditions you've embraced.

Strats will come with attempts. Defeating Velious and Luclin isn't
necessary for the 'strats' you will learn... given luclin gear wihtout
fighting for it... they could still take PoP  learning the strats as
they go.

To be sure. But coming from a velious background doesn't mean your a
moron.. it means you play less, or started more recently. Don't worry.

That's rather the point. You *shouldn't* know what was said to target
one... but you do...  how long can you keep that straight?

I presume the GM despawns the event. And then the inquisition begins
in earnest. The lack of coherent internal (logged) chatter amonst your
bots alone would be a pretty big tipoff. What are you going to do
write an 'inane chatter engine' too... I bet even that wouldn't pass
more than a cursory examination.

Sure in theory. Now do it. I dare ya... just do it. You pull that off
and you'll have an AI engine you could sell to a hundred game
publishers and be set for life.

Game companies have striven for years to come up with human like
AIs... so far the results have ranged from abysmal to miserable. If
you think you can whip one together just like that then I'd invest in
it myself. ;)
