I have tried 2 boxing on my system, but did not go so far as to crank 
down everything.  It was usable for bringing in a cleric for a rez, but 
not for actually playing.  I have an AMD XP 3200+ with 1GB of dual 
channel DDR3200 memory and an ATi 9800 Pro with 128MB or DDR.  I would 
consider my system a midrange system...
