From the way I have read the description it sounds like the translocators
will take you to the Plane of Knowledge (like the Nexus) and from there you
go to any other city.  Since this zone will be a part of PoP, I'm sure
you'll have to have the expansion.  Since this feature seems to be important
to them it is probably something they are hoping to sell the expansion on
(honestly one of the main reasons I am buying it, that and I am just stupid
with money) so I doubt they will allow people to use it who have no
purchased the expansion.

Just my opinion, I could be wrong.
