You got ripped off.  You can now buy Everquest Evolutions, which
is Six expansions, for only slightly more than you paid for the
trilogy... and if you end up liking EQ you'll want all the
expansions anyway, buying them piecemeal will cost many times
more than buying Evolution, so you'll end up getting that anyway.

They -say- they will only guarantee characters will be saved for
three months after you stop paying.  In practice, nobody has ever
reported a wiped character, and some people have come back as
long as two years later, and otehrs have recovered characters
that they actually deleted.

TO take a month off, just don't pay for that month, and start
paying again when you get back.  They won't even threaten to
delete your character till you take three months off.

I think they eliminated the tutorial; if it still exists, its a
seperate exe file, and when you run it you get a very small solo
play EQ game with a pregenerated character, one fight, and some
simple running around and talking to people exercises.  It uses
an out of date interface and half the stuff it tells you is wrong
now.  So don't bother, honestly, just make up a character, any
character, and play around with him for a few levels, then start
over and apply what you've learned.

They killed it.  Apparantly they were afraid their competition
was getting free information about how such things work out.

Its the newest server, and was at one time a good one to go to as
a newbie, since you'd be surrounded by other low level people. 
At this point, though, thats not especially the case, and the
best approach I can reccomend would be to find a server where
someone you know is playing.

On any given server, there can only be one character with each
name.  Further, there's an extensive list of names that are
forbidden; names of any NPC or mob or area in the game,
profanities, some corporate names and trademarks; these lists are
automated as is the list of character names that are taken.  This
means you can be rejected right away for any of those conflicts. 
Then the game sends your proposed name to a GM who is supposed to
check it for more subtle defects, like Joepaternoisanass, where
the game's parser is unable to see that it violates the naming
policy.  However, since there are few GMs on, this usually
doesn't actually happen, instead the name sits in virtual limbo a
bit, doesn't get rejected (because nobody looks at it) and gets
approved.

This is because you are using an ancient creaky old manual, which
wasn't very good in the first place, but there is an entirely new
UI in place, the old one is gone forever, and if you don't like
it, then you now have the ability to change it.  I'm no expert on
that aspect, though, leave it to someone else to explain custom
UI skins.

Again, I'm so used to the way things are that I can't even
picture what your complaint is.  I use the arrow keys, and for
"strafe running" use control forward right or control forward
left.  I can use mouselook movement too, but I tend not to.  Its
really a question of getting used to it, the interface eventually
fades into the background and you simply move
