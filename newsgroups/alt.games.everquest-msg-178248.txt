Gotta agree here :/ I've been in some fairly messy situations due to a 
group member falling asleep.  I had a chance to go on a raid with some 
friends yesterday as I'd called in sick from work, but considering I 
couldn't stay at the keyboard for more than an hour without feeling like 
hell again, I passed.  Better that they form an exp group somewhere 
instead of getting halfway in to get "I gotta go" (or worse, if I'd 
fallen asleep, nothing at all).
