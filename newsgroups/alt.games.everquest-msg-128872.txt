I hunted there at 30th and also learned of the no mez problem. Then I
started
debuffing them and buffing the party members.  Root also takes as well as
whirl
till you hurl, and I even nuked after I was SURE that the main tank had agro
firmly on themselves. I fell into the thinking that the only way to group as
an
enchanter was by using my mez line, and had to totally rethink my class
abilities.
Also, casting a pet helps. It is like a non-agro DOT. Just Rune II yourself
so you
can get the giant to agro your pet, back off and the main tank will take
agro from
your pet quickly. Then your pet is free to attack and help take out the
giant with
little harm. That is why I am glad I chose the Enchanter. I find myself
rethinking
my role every 4 - 5 levels.
