Yoda:
A venerated sage with vast power and knowledge, you gently guide
forces around you while serving as a champion of the light.

Judge me by my size, do you? And well you should not - for my ally is
the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life greets it, makes it grow.
Its energy surrounds us, and binds us. Luminescent beings are we, not
this crude matter! You must feel the Force around you, everywhere.
