Don't forget the higher AC that Iksar get because of their scaly hides; unless
you enjoy being KOS everywhere at first, play a human.

I don't play a Monk, but I know several people who do, and none of them have
ever mentioned any Quellious follower only items for Monks. One of them, who is
fairly high level, told me he has never heard of any, but he's an agnostic, so
he wouldn't be able to use them anyway.
