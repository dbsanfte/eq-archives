It's almost all no drop anyways.

As far as I can tell there's nothing left in EQ for me. Time to call
it quits, and go mmorpgless for a few months at least. At least
there's some quality strategy games on the way, Kohan 2, Dawn of War,
Children of the Nile, even Sims 2. But other than that, see you all in
the next addiction.
