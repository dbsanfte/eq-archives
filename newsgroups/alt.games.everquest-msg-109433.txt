Won't argue that point.

But, in this case Jonas Salk's life *IS* more important than the lives
of those two kids.  Those kids might grow up to do something
important, but Salk has, in this horribly specific example, already
done something that WILL be important.  

And evil is, IMHO, not a form of insanity.  Only a sane person can be
evil, IMHO.  And insane man MIGHT do evil things, but just doing
something evil does not make that person wholly evil.  An insane
person is somebody who is sick.  Somebody who cannot judge between
right or wrong, or is incapable of making that distinction, might
commit 'evil' acts, but that does not make him evil.  Sick, yeah.
Maybe sick to the point of having to be put down, but not evil.
