Smacked into unconsciosness in very short order, then the crappy ranger heal
hit me for 90 points, stood me back up just long enough to be killed.  I was
with a ranger at the time, but they had me at low health so fast that low
health aggro took over before she had a chance to try to get aggro form them
both.  I rarely travel with gate memorized unfortunately, so that was not an
option for me.
