But I think its especially hard for an asian to write it well, which
is what they have to do in EQ. When you think about it many of the
English speaking Americans In EQ don't even write it well ;) In spoken
English you don't have all the incorrect usage of too, to, your,
you're, you, u, their, they're, there, etc.

On the other hand when you have several different languages people
would be typing in on an asian server, English might be the one
language which they all know well enought to type in mixed company.
How many Japanese know korean or the reverse?

Yeah, kind of what I was saying above. If you had an all japanese or
all korean guild in EQ they'd very likely write Japanese or Korean,
respectively. If you had people from Vietnam, Japan and Korea grouping
they'd possibly all just write in English. Or am I off base and one of
those languages is more apt to be known by all three?

Yeah and if what I think above is true the Aussies would move from a
server where 99 percent of the populace wrote in the same language
they write in to a server where upwards of 90 percent of the populace
would either not write in it or do so very poorly.
