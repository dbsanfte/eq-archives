I am trying to do the Lambent armor quest and am camping Froon and Choon but
when they drop the Rune of the One Eye it doesn't say whether it is the top
portion or middle portion. Do you have to use the identify song to find this
out or is there a difference between "Rune of the One Eye" and "Top portion
of Rune of the One Eye", "Middle portion of Rune of the One Eye"?
