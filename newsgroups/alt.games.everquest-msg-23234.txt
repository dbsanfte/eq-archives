Well, it's half wrong.  Meleing is definitely becoming less and less of an
option for him, soloing however kicks ass with a druid.  Even my Shaman can
easily solo at lvl 29 still.  At 26 I was easily soloing yellows, now, at
29, blues are trivial, except for mobs with a ranged attack, some whites are
doable, haven't tried any yellows.
