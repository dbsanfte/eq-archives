Bard has lull that doesn't cost any mana, to assist in breaking up 
spawns, and is the CC person, in case breaking up spawns doesn't work 
out as you'd hoped.  Your alternative choices would be Warrior: no way 
at all of single pulling, Ranger, could single pull with harmony if only 
LDoN was outdoors, could at least use root splitting.  Or you.  Cleric 
has a better lull line than bard (since a recent patch).  But you are 
lower level, don't seem to be familiar with lull, and are probably the 
person they least want to have getting hit by adds.

Further, because the nerf to lull spells was quite recent, its quite 
possible the bard has substantial experience as a puller... or not, 
because at his level its also possible he's only been playing the 
character for a week and only just left Paladul, where pulling is less 
than an art form... similar to the difference between fly fishing and 
using hand grenades in a pond.

Its an old line from way back before they changed the spelling on the 
lull line by changing the P to an L.  You seem to have missed the entire 
time when the lull line was absolutely godlike, and join us in the 
modern demigod level, where lulls last only 42 seconds (bard lulls 18 
seconds) instead of 5 minutes... but still, when you see the word lull, 
think "harmony that works indoors" instead of what your experience may 
suggest "easy way to aggro all the mobs in the area"

Bard is now a pulling class, as are enchanters, clerics, and paladins... 
quite possibly still the premier pulling class, even with the newly 
shortened duration of their lull, because cleric and paladin CC sucks, 
and enchanters evaporate rather rapidly in a bad overpull situation if 
all the mobs enter with the enchanter's name tops on their list; bards 
are better built to stand up to a brief beating.
