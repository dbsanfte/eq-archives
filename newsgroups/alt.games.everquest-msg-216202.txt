Oh, so you only act like a maniac in dungeons you already know well?  Thats a bit
different, if you've been there before many times and can be reasonably certain
nothing unusual ever happens.  Part of the point of LDoN was supposed to be that
things do vary; many dungeons, many missions, and different difficulties based on
your party composition.  If two weeks into the release you already know
everything there is to know about every dungeon at every level, I guess caution
is no longer necessary.  But I'm glad to see that you were cautious the first
time thru, and assuming caution didn't mean keeping the healer at 30% mana
anyway, it looks like a victory for my point to see you admit this.
