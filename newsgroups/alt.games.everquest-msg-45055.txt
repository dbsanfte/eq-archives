	Velium weapons are the same as fine steel and process at level
25.  They are dirt cheap from players.  The best you can get cheaply
is probably the langseax.  

	One I liked, although not a great weapon, was the gnoll hide
lariat (3 dmg.  20 delay  effect: Stun   IIFC it has some AC too) that
processes at 25.  The GHL is a common drop in Blackburrow or sells for
10 pp.  It's speed made it nice as an off hand weapon to raise dual
weild and 1h slash skills.  The stun only went off enough to make up
for the low damage when my warrior had a DEX buff, but I often grouped
with a shaman so that wasn't a problem for me.  Between Slam and the
GHL stun, caster mobs were easy.
