I don't think the problem is just with pricing, it has more to do with the
perceived utility of the potions themselves. You say there are tons of good
potions, but I don't think most players would agree with you to the point of
going to the trouble of buying and using them.  I maxed my Alchemy skill and
made all the various potions, including mana regen, DS, stun potions, SoW,
Levitation, things that you would *think* are attractive potion
propositions. I was the only player on FV making stun potions for days after
they first arrived in GoD, and they sat on my vendor forever. I lowered the
prices well below loss points just to get rif of them and they still didn't
move. In my experience, no one ever got excited about any of the potions
that I could make, and even the people such as yourself who would comment on
their utility rarely actually put their plats down and ordered. The Alchemy
experience was a big yawn for most everyone.

I agree with Graeme, Alchemy was on life support prior to this, and these
AA's just pulled the plug.
