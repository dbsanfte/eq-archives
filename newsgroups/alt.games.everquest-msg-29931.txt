Like you, I've never understood the anger with which some people deal
with trains. I can only assume they're idiots.

If they're sitting by a zone for whatever reason, just where do they
think someone in trouble is going to run? Sitting on the tracks is
utterly moronic if they can't tolerate trains.

Then there are the cries from people who think that the person making
the train should shout it out. Sure, yes, it's nice if they do, and
plenty of folks (myself included) have a "/shout Train" hot key. But
no one is obligated to shout a warning, and I can certainly understand
that someone being chased by a dozen mobs is far more interested in
escaping than sounding an alarm.

And of course there are the times when I've seen a train go racing by
me, and knowing that the person leading it is probably a touch busy, I
call the train for him - inevitably I get a couple of dumb-asses
sending me nasty tells about the train "I" pulled on them.

Bottom line - the people who consistently whine about trains are
complete pinheads, not worth more than a minor effort at explanation.



Wow, I vented. Cool.
