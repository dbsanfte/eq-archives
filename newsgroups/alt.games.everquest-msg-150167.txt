Heh I used to play around 2 years ago and tried to play again when the
luclin addition came out but couldn't level because I couldn't find
groups.  What I saw most of the time where groups power leveling
friends or folks PL'ing themselves (there's nothing wrong with that
mind you). Seems to me that the majority of players is just too busy
to make new friends or perhaps been burned so often by others that
they are unwilling to make new game associations..

I'm looking forward to something new perhaps SWG, EQ2 or another 1st
person MMORPG.
