Oddly (more than oddly, counter to common sense), global warming might 
well result in a colder Canada (at least parts of Canada, anyway).

Here's the scenario; eastern Canada, along with Greenland and Europe, 
are warmed by water coming up from the tropics.  This water then cools 
and drops down to the bottom of the sea, where it flows back down to the 
tropics, which it cools off while it gets heated, and returns again to 
do more warming.

Melt enough glaciers, though, and you can lower the salinity of the 
seawater enough that instead of sinking, it freezes; water being an odd 
solid indeed, the ice floats.  Cold water stops flowing south, warm 
water stops flowing north to replace it, and suddenly you see the 
currently balmy by comparison areas now warmed by the gulf stream et al 
going to their natural climate... which is about the same as Sibera's

This is more or less what we think happened back in the "little ice age" 
which lasted until 1400 AD, 500 years or so IIRC, driving the Norse out 
of Greenland, glaciers in the Thames, all kinds of nastiness.  From a 
warm spell, not unlike the one we are currently hard at work on producing.

Funny world isn't it?  If only MMOG designers would incorporate Sim 
Earth type effects we could create by tampering, say with that "stop the 
rain" spell druids have in EQ1:)
