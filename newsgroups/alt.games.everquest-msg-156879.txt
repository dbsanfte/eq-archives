Only othmirs in CS so far, but hear i should be able to single pull them 
at 58. Still no clue to how were supposed to pull the Chief camp now, 
since hes higher level, and doubt he cares much about my level.

Then the Kith General raids, and the Bracer/Robe/Talisman of Benevolence 
is gonna be a lot harder, will need some monks to FD split the mob....oh 
wait, monks got nerfed at last patch.
