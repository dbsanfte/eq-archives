I have never been able to do only quads. At a given level, there are only
few mobs in sufficient numbers to quad.

I think that partly answers your last question. A group would run out of
quads faster than a solo. I would still like to try it with another druid or
wizard though. Do other classes have a target-aoe nuke or dot?

The other part of the answer is kei. I must confess that I never hunt
without it now. With kei, getting mana back while running is not a problem.
So that also is a factor when considering quad versus root/rot.

I have not tried the root/rot method for many levels now. I would in a
dungeon, but I have not needed it outdoors since they unnerfed snares. When
I hunt solo mobs, I prefer to snare/dot/nuke and med afterwards if necessary
instead of during the fight. I find Allakazam's bestiary invaluable to find
out the low blues and the low reds for my level.
