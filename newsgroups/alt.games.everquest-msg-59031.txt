Haste and clarity last the same duration?  Are you playing DAoC or something?

Nonsense.  If there are no mobs to fight, haste does nothing.  When
you first form a group, the casters spend a bunch of mana buffing
the party, then the party sits for a while to regenerate that mana.
If the chanter slaps haste on the tanks, it will wear off before
the group is done sitting.  If he doesn't clarity the casters, then
the sitting will go on twice as long as might have.  I guess he could
slap haste on again... and have it wear off again... while he waits.

His approach certainly seems to be melee oriented; no haste without
mobs, haste as appropriate to the situation when the fight is on.  Haste
without a fight would be like the wizard using his big nukes on passing
snow bunnies, an utter waste of mana. Well, the wizard might at least
get a snow bunny pelt out of it... the tanks are getting nothing at all
out of haste while they sit on their buttocks.

While the main mode of damage production is melee, in most groups
at the high end of the game, it takes mana to make this work well;
cleric must have mana to keep melee alive, chanter must have mana
to haste, shaman must have mana to slow the mob down... if you
want to find someone not to clarity, I suppose its the mage and
wizard, both of whom really need mana only to do damage with, and
inefficiently.
