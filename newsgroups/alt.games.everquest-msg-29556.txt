If visibility of kids was perfect every time there'd be no reason for these 
kinds of laws. It isn't. Especially at 85 mph.

So, it's still wrong. 

I assume you've got a point besides "is it wrong if you can't get caught" 
because that's a old saw. If it's wrong, it's wrong, regardless of the 
probability of punishment.

And to put this back on EQ, yes, I think it's cheating to add things to the 
gameplay that enhances your information that "legit" players do not have. 
And of course, cheating is wrong. Should they be banned for doing it? I 
think maybe a warning for first offenders, banning for second. What's the 
chances of getting caught? Irrelavent to the question of morality.
