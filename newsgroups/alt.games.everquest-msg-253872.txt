I have recently become a big fan of Burning Woods. Most of the mobs
there drop from 2 to 6pp (about 4 in 5 I'd say) in actual plat plus a
sum of gold and other coin, the other 1 in 5 drop no plat but average
about 1/2 to 1pp in other coin.

That's every mob in the zone. There is no fighting others for money
dropping mobs or anything like that. Picked up a few Lv. 55 spells
too, Canni 3 and Tears of Drizzul (sp?). The Tears going for more than
500pp in the bazaar. (Everyone else is selling them from 650 to
1500pp, so I decided to undercut everyone and sell at 500pp for a
quick sale.) I made about 500pp in coin loot and another 200pp in
other vendor candy. (Spell research components mostly) Also a Giant
Tree Flayer (sp?) which used to be pretty cool, but should probably be
sold to a vendor for the plat they will give for it. There was also a
Shirt from one of the giants that sold for 88pp.

I got killed trying, but the named Zombie Ape, Gullerback (sp?) drops
the Tattered Mantle, every time, which sells for about 200 to 500pp in
the Bazaar on FV. (I paid 250pp to twink my Warrior with one.)

Now, I said every mob in the zone, but that's not exactly true. I only
killed one wasp. They con KoS, but I think that's a ruse, they don't
actually attack unless you attack them. (Remember when your mom said,
"Don't bother them and they won't bother you"?) I say this because I
was looking for a pull, and turned around and saw one buzzing right in
my face, but it didn't attack until I attacked first. Didn't take the
time to find out for sure though, but since there was a faction hit, I
thought I'd find out later rather than ruin my faction with them.

However the one that I did kill dropped a "Fire Emerald". I figured it
was one of those 2 to 12pp deals and didn't investigate. However once
I got it back to the vendor, I found out it was worth 80pp. I don't
know how common their gem drops are, but they drop coin too. (Or at
least the one I killed did, but I don't remember how much.) So I might
have to come back later and exterminate some bugs.

I spent about 4 hours there and got 500pp in coin, 200pp in vendor
loot, and assuming my bazaar items sell at the low prices I have them
set at, I should get another 650pp from that.

Now here's the kicker. I was PLing a level 39 to 42 warrior with a 55
shaman. So I was killing one mob about every 2 or 3 minutes maximum. I
was avoiding the Sarnaks (SoWed) the Wasps (faction hit) and the Wyrms
(under cons), and I still didnï¿½t run out of mobs in the tiny little
place I was pulling from. (near -1350, +3040) Also I had a lot of down
time (no KEI for the Shaman or Temp for the Warrior) and couldn't kill
the named Zombie Ape. (He wiped me, resisted 4 slows and 3 cripples,
hits for some outrageous number)

I'm thinking with level 65 spells and Pet, you could simply walk
around and kill everything that moves. Probably wouldn't run out of
mobs before you had to sit down and med. Also the loot is fairly light
weight and much of it is stackable (much of it sells for 1 to 4pp each
too, about as good as FS, but stackable and light) so you can use 10
slot bags instead of summoned WR bags.

I don't know if you could match the 3kpp number that was mentioned
above, but you should be able to quadruple my numbers certainly.

For those of us who aren't level 65 yet, the money output will be
lower, but some of the mobs will probably still give exp, so at least
there is that.
