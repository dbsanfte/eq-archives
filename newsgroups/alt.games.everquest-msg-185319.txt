Hi,


>Maybe they could make a bazaar in every major city. They could put

>without actually running it properly.

and thats the point ... they will never make a vendor placable all over
Norrath ... they want to continue selling SoL ;-) And in my opinion the
market would screw up ... (just my 2cp).

The system right now is ok for me ... just dont want to be kicked each few
minutes. In my opinion every vendor should look at his char from time to
time ... I use bazaar while doing research ect. and so the char is "in
reach".

What they should do is to prevent spells and songs as well as pets in
bazaar... its really annoying to run by a bard with an ae-song .... or
zoning in and only seeing 30 familars or pets at entrance searching for
their master ... This doesnt make lag / serverload better !

Have fun in game

Christian
