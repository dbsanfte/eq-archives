If I'm following you right, your saying the SOE thinks people will want 
to play both, and that its a weak proposition?

If that's what you are saying, then yes, I agree. I also think that the 
D1/D2 argument applies as well... that EQ2 will take over as the 
flagship, and EQ1 will be eventually be relegated the same status as LoE 
et al.

In which case there is no reason, nor need, to split groups. And in 
fact, argues in favour of labeling EQ1 threads as EQ1, and keeping one 
group.

However, there is also the possibility that EQ2 will not take over as 
the flagship, that its just a flash in the pan, and interest will die 
out to a relative trickle. And if that's the case then there is no need 
for an EQ2 group either.

And that is why I'm advocating a wait and see.

The only way we we'll need 2 groups is if both games continue to thrive. 
I don't think that is terribly likely long term.
