Fighting Statue today, we had a rotation of 3 clerics and 3 druids;
Cleric, Druid, Cleric, Druid, Cleric, Druid

Worked quite nicely, the druid heals were timed to hit a little sooner
than the cleric heals, but still left the MA a bit injured, then the cleric
heal would hit and make up the difference.  We'd planned to do it
with 4 clerics on a tight rotation... boy are we glad that 4th cleric
had to log out, because we had some serious problems with having
enough mana to close out the fight, and thats with 6 of us with KEI
and bard songs playing in our ears and two charges of mod rod each
eaten during the duration.  4 people trying to handle heals would
certainly not have had enough mana regen to take care of business.

What will kill this plan, in the end, is the fact that our heals weren't
hitting for all that much different totals, clerics averaging around 4000
per heal with druids doing their max (3000 or so) everytime.  As MA
HP totals get larger, cleric heals will keep scaling up to where they are
doing 7500 heals every time, and the druids will still only be doing
3000.  Then you'll be spending roughly the same mana for heals that
are only half as good, while right now they are about 3/4ths as big.
