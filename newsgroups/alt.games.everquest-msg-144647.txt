I really hope you do not think you have the ability to estimate the 
value of a whole nation with a single comment.
Get out of your bed and visit much more foreign countries.
I am French. My friends like me so much, while my ennemies don't.
One of my neighbours is a stupid asshole, but the other is the 
sweetest human being I have ever met.

The rude French man I am definitively not thinks it is the same for 
Americans or other ones. Am I right?
