I also wanted put in there somewhere that you might want to look for
elemental tailored pieces.  Depending on your server and your relationship
with the elemental planes you may have varied results finding pieces or
ingredients in the bazaar.  Often a good way to find some armor is to go
into the bazaar on a Saturday night and do a search for Necromancer useable
armor for the slot you want and sort them by whatever stats you are
interested in - HP, Int, Mana...  I have found some nice pieces that I
didn't know by name by just searching every few days.
