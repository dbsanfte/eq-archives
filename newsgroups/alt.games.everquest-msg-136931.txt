Good deals part II:

- Ry'gorr gloves for 20pp (other were selling for 200pp, so I thought that
must be a mistake.But when was about to buy the gloves the Trader ran away
to the bank. So I frantically hailed her, and she came back making the trade
for 20pp, what luck)
- Platinum Jasper Ring 25pp (I feel really bad now, because I just has 2
made for cost price, and one of them even failed so lost 105pp on a plat
bar. Anyway going to sell it from some good profit :) )
