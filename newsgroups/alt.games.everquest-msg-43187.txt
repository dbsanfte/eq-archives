For hunting I recommend the the northern part of The Overthere. Succulents and
Cockatrice's are the best things to hunt, Rhino's aren't bad either. They all
give good exp. and loot. The only ones that aren't worth attacking (and,
incidentally, are the only ones you'll be KOS to) are the Sarnaks. They hit hard
frequently and drop no loot! 
On the northern edge of the yellow lake (it's in the NE corner of the zone) is
an Iksar merchant. He's not cheap but he does sell food, water, and bandages (as
well as throwing stars which is great for my monk). HTH. :)
