I don't see why they would have to. They can very easily merge the 
hardware without having to merge the server databases -- the same way 
that now the same box can be serving different zones within the same 
server, they could conceivably handle two or more servers off the same 
box, if the player load is light enough. Hell, given the rate of 
increase in computing power, in a few years they will be able to run the 
entire game back end off a mobile phone.

If they *do* merge server databases it will be because the players ask 
them to, if the numbers decline too far, rather than because they have 
to.
