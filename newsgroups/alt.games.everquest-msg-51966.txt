Yeah, I used to do that in Highpass and Cazic. If a train piles on
you, stand in middle to a ae stun and do a ae mez, mezzing yoruself as
well.  Then instantly hit the ESC key to clear your target.  The ones
who resist ae mez will hit you, and unwittingly cause you to target
them.  Then you can stun and single shot mez.  Should be enough time
to single mez two then back up and redo ae mez on initial block.

Also, as an enchanter, ALWAYS keep Rune III up if you have it.
Nevermind the cost, it will save your neck.
