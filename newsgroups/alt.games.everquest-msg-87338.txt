Ok, Dan. Currently on Xev, the prices for Lammies in GBay have plummeted
to around 2.5K to 3K since the Luclin mudflation.

Let's say you came into one on a deal and started auctioning it. You, as
an auctioner, see the prices fluctuating and know the current price. You
/auction "Lamentation. Send tell with offers."

Some guy who's system wouldn't run Luclin till he bought a new computer
just got back online this week and came into a serious windfall of cash.
He wants a Lammy and just zoned into GBay and saw your /auction first.
He ask's how much. You say "make me an offer". He thinks they still go
for 6 to 8K. He offers you five thinking to set up a "haggling session".

Do you take the money?

I don't think we need to wait for an answer.

Noble hagglers.  That's a really good one. I've got to work that into a
sig line someplace.

You're selling an item. You know what it's worth and what you should try
to get for it in the current market. Somebody asks, you tell them. Or,
you can just fuck them if they are more into adventuring than marketing
and don't know. Enough said.

Yes, yes, yes... "caveat emptor" etc. It's HIS responsibility to know
how much he should pay, obviously. It's his responsibilty to avoid being
ripped off by con men..........

Ooops.
