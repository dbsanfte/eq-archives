Why not?  Isn't your main an enchanter?  I'm not sure of your level, but 
if you're 60, you should be able to get a group together to do 'em.  I've 
never actually done Juggs with a pickup group (generally didn't do 
pickup in Seb that often), but I've done them with a 
single guild group several times.
