I agree that it's a EULA violation, but then again, so is sharing a
copy of Windows with your spouse. However, who is going to build two
PCs for themselves and their spouse and then buy TWO copies of
Windows? What I am saying here, is that I think it is ridiculous for a
publisher to expect or force people in the same family to each have
their own copy of a particular piece of software.

On the other hand, if their intent is to reduce twinking, I can think
of no better way.
