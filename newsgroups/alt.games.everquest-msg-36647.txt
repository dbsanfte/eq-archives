I forgot to train it with my ranger until 12, noticed it had never gone
up despite mashing the button every time it popped.  12 levels of
solo/group play ... no increases, I'm in-effective without it.  I go
train the stupid thing.  and the story about the guy who got to 40+
without training it and finally seeing an increase after training it is
legendary.
