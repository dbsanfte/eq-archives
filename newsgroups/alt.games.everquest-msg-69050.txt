No fears there.

Once, I saw an opportunity and invited a beggar in SQeynos to follow me
somewhere where they could get 'a little something for their troubles'.  He
followed me into the Arena at full jog.  I paused for a second, he overran
me, and BACKSTAB!  His game was disrupted =)

I found out later he was a true newbie but had learned how to beg in other
games.  I hope I helped break him of the habit here.
