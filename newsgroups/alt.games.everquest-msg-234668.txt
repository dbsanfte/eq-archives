Yeah, I know it sucks.

I can get a xp2600 w 512 for about $350cdn (w mobo and case).  Add a
decent vidcard for $150.  It's just money that isn't in the budget
right this minute.  I was looking more towards April/May.

Not the worst though.  Buddy of mine uses a P2-233.  He has a better
vid card though.  He can still spend time in mid-tier planes without
complete death.  He does take a while to zone though. =)
