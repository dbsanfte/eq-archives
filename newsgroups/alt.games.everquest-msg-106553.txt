Ow ;(

We've single grouped it ages ago with mid/high fifties and no chanter 
using a shaman on slows and hastes... Low fifties though you probably 
made the right call.

No bard/necro?

With a decent 60 puller and folks who understand instructions like "stay
here, do not move." I wouldnt think an enchanter should be make-or-break.
