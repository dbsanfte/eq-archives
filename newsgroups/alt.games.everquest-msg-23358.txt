Thanks to everyone who replied :) yes, sorry i must have missed the messages on
here about befallen being changed, havent been here long.
Anyway i returned tonight and managed to enlist the help of a 30 something guy
who kindly dragged my sorry ass outta there. I was "Oh thanks, thats great of
you, thanks alot" /bow etc...loot the corpse..oh its the 'other' one that has 2
bone chips on it.arghhh! hehe
"Its the wrong one" i sheepishly tell him.
"Yea i saw another guy dragging your other one around" he replies
/boggle
he wanders off. Im getting desperate now so i offer to pay anybody who grabs my
corpse all the cash on it, which is about 10pp and 30gp which aside from 5 pp
in the bank is my life savings.
a guy drags it out and i empty my pockets for him :/
ah well, just glad to get it back and wont be returning to befallen for a
while, the quest thing with the woman in chains sounds great though, wish i was
high enough to do it.
I play on the Rathe by the way.
