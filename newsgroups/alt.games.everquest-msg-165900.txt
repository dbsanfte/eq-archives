Thats thinking inside the box

I happily hunted in EW at level 2, in GD at 24, in EW at 29...

Its really just a question of knowing what you are doing, knowing what the mobs
are.

As for "taking up a slot somebody else could use" thats nonsense too.  OK, if
there's a full group I'm part of, its a fair arguement.  But if the group has
less than 6 members, and many do, then its not a question of taking up a slot.

Question is, do I contribute?  As a bard, mana song, haste, slow, snare, stat
boosts, DS, mez.... there's lots I can do, and half of it isn't based on the
level of the mob at all.

Next question is, how much.  Well, admittedly less than a bard 10 levels higher.

Next question, though, is how much does it cost to have me around?  Aha, also
substantially less than a bard 10 levels higher.  My theory is it evens out, or
heck, perhaps does better than even out, depending on what the group is doing.
In PoJ, all the mobs we were killing were blue to me.  A group of all 46's could
take them down... and in fact I'm pretty sure if I could pull em single I could
solo them.  In PoI, half the mobs were still blue to me, and I'm seriously
considering soloing there, yes they come in pairs, but I can use lull line to
single pull out of pairs, at which point if the GY is empty I can chant kite em
to death there without ever being touched.  This seems the most likely scenario
for soloing in PoP at my level.

PoD the mobs we were killing were all red to me, but there ARE even con mobs in
there, and another nice chant circle spot if I can single pull.

Why would I want to hunt planes?

1) This isn't my first character.  I've already hunted many of the desirable
spots in the pre POP world with other characters.

2) Why do people climb Mt Everest?  Or to put it another way, "we do these
things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard"

3) People say you can't hunt in planes under 55, won't be able to kill anything,
won't be able to get a group.  I LOVED teasing my guildmates with the fact that
I was doing it not at 55, not at 52, but at 46... the lowest possible level to
be there.

4) The ZEM in planes is much higher than anywhere else at my level.  If they'd
put a bunch of mid 40s mobs in Paladul Caverns, I'd hunt there.  But they
didn't.  So you go where the action is, cause noone is going to bring the
mountain to Mohammed.
