We're finally going to buy luclin, but it will probably be a little choppy
if we try to run it on what we have now.

Pentium III 450, GeForce2, 20g HD, SB soundcard, DSL.  Not sure if there's
anything else you need to know, but what would you guys recommend we upgrade
that'll ensure smooth playing?

Thanks

~Nikki
