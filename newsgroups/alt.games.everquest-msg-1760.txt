I actually agree with you guys.  There's nothing like a well written flame.
Hell, I've even saved flames before now.  And to respond to what some people
have said, yes, you can say what you damn well please on Usenet and I'd die
to defend your right to do so.  I'd sooner swallow my own tongue than
advocate censorship of any form, especially in an open forum like this.  I
just wanted to point out that the background noise (which I'm well aware
that you's find on any NG) is drowning everything else out a bit at the
moment.

Trying to put out the flames completely is indeed "pissing up a rope" but
that's a hell of a lot better than "pissing down a rope", at least that was
what that damp, angry mountaineer told me ;-)
