That sounds more like a question for Sony's customer support than
for the newsgroup, but there are probably folks here who have had
similar situations and may be able to offer some advice.

My own guess is that, once they bill you the $99, your account is
paid up for the full year and there's no way to get your money
back if you want to change it partway through the year.  However,
you should be able to cancel the auto-billing option such that
the account won't automatically be renewed the next time the year
runs out.

Remember, of course, that the monthly rate is quite a bit higher,
so if you end up playing even, what, 7 months out of 12, it'll
come to more than $99.  Also, the $99 sounds like it's the special
rate that they offered during the 6th anniversary.  That rate is
no longer offered, but the terms under which they offered it are
that you get to keep the $99 rate as long as you leave it set up
for automatic renewal.  (This caused headaches for many people,
including myself, when credit card changes and/or Sony screw-ups
caused many renewals to fail.  Sony did eventually sort things out
and restore the $99/year rate for the affected accounts.)  What
that means is, if you later change your mind and want to get back
on a yearly rate, it'll be noticeably higher than $99/year.  (The
current yearly rate is $144/year.)
