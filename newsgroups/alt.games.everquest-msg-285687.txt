In my experience, raid group structure, and how many of class x you need 
varies both by expansion and by individual raid.

You need a different raid structure to deal efficiently with The Rathe 
Council than you need to deal efficiently with Coirnav vs. what you need 
to efficiently deal with Ikkinz 4 vs. what you need to handle Rallos Zek 
in PoTime.

You can inefficiently beat all of those encounters with roughly the same 
force.  Also, the further you are on in terms of progression the more 
one side can compensate for another in some raids.
