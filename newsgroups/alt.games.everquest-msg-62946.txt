You may as well though since at 34 or 35 when you can start soloing
mobs like the fantastic xp dwarf lesbian looking axe ladies in butcher
and harder mobs, that tactic no longer works. Your pin cushion days
are more or less over. I started them at 34 which was a bit hard still
viewing the spell book and LONG before the days of snare and root
stacking so I had to use the 34 dot on them while they were unsnared
and therefore taking less damage (they res nukes darn good)

Those are about the best xp for a druid from 34 to 55 or so probably,
soloing or even better than grouping. I did the 2 in front of kaladim,
what you do once kos is invis, target one and harmony then pull other
one. No one hardly camps those two because they are a) slower spawn
and b) assist each other unless you have harmony to seperate. At 35 or
so though the spawn is plenty fast for you by the time you split them
and med up. Best part: You kill them and sell their axe to the vendor
right there or in the next hut since the axe ladies have their OWN
faction, kaladim citizens (makes them far preferrable to do instead of
similar mobs like the gnome guards for me)

Befor they nerfed the axe value to a vendor, they were 23 plat a pop.
Now they are like 5. The ladies always have the axe and often an FS
weapon too. Before the nerf from level 35 - 39 I made something like
15,000 plat or more just from their axes. I bought dwarven work
boots.. eventually efritti boots etc. My friend I told about the spawn
who then monopolized it (bastard) made 80,000 plat before the nerf.

Even the stuff you fight in kunark or velious at 29 for okay xp which
are blues are going to hit too hard for a druid of that level for the
most part. So get ye some plus wis and mana stuff. Playing keep away
is what a druid is made for so you may as well get used to it and put
the pin cushion tactics far behind you.
