It sounds like the standard way that we've always done loot. SInce my
groups tend to always be NBG, anyone who got an NBG item if left out
of rolls on everything else. Those rare times when you get more items
than you have group members, the group picks in reverse order on the
2nd go around. 

One thing I'll often do as Master Looter is to hold back a couple of
gems. Say you have 3 items and a 6 person group I might hold back
enough to give one or two diamonds to those that didn't win anything.
Not really worth the hassle these days, nobody cares that much about
200p but I'd do it often in earlier levels. 

Rgds, Frank
