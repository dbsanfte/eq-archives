Unless the item has a lot of uber stats, a lot of people would take
the focus item over the stats. Burning Affliction does a LOT more for
a necromancer or shaman's DPS than even as much as 10 wis.

In fact, usually in a group with a magician, all the casters are
begging the mage for summon focus items to cover focus effects they
don't already have.

Next question?
