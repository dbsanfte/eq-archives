I log in yesterday and am immediately asked to help with a corpse run
in Fear. Our chanters have been bringing druids into Fear for a quick
track to see if shissar or bg is up. That time the poor chanter and
druid didn't make it out.

No problem. I port the interested guildees to Feerrott, we buff up and
head in. As we're buying time for the dead to loot their corpses, I
decide to check track. Wraith of Shissar and the broken golem are both
up.  

All evenings' activities are suspended. Phone calls are made, messages
posted, and we mobilize to take the shissar. The guildee who has
waited the longest (6 months) isn't on but should be soon. One of our
other chanters also needs it and arranges to stay later.

Break-in is flawless. Amazing what you can do with a 59 & 60 chanter
and people who actually LISTEN to the instructions the raid leader
gives.

We head to the shissar. All goes well except for a brief period of
excitement when the raid leader decides we try using AE to clear the
TTs.  After we rez the dead, the raid leader promises to never try
that technique again.

The guest of honor arrives, the chanter who has waited 6 months to get
the last piece for his epic. He is bouncing off the walls. Spirits are
high. Shissar screams "I shall return" and repops, sparking a flurry
of snide remarks from the guildees.

We prep to pull shissar. The puller brings the last few mobs which we
take down effortlessly.

Cazic Thule spawns. The entire zone repops EXCEPT the shissar and
broken golem. We were about 10 minutes from pulling our mob.

Sometimes there is just no justice...
