Please be so good as to enumerate your charges against Isreal.  What have
they done that would be considered "terrorism"?  References would be nice.

Are you considering retaliation for Palestinian attacks "terrorism"?  If so,
your mind is seriously distorted.  Even if that were the case, the
Palestinians have it within their power to put an end to Isreali
retaliation.  Have they ever tried it?  I know Isreal has, and the
Palestinian attacks continued.  Hmm.... I wonder if that means anything?

It's not called "oppression."  That word doesn't apply when you're in a
de-facto state of war.  How should Isreal respond to being bombed?  With
peace and love?  Should they stay their hand?  Every time they do, they only
find a longer string of attacks to follow.  The Prime Minister had the right
idea when he treated the terrorism like it is... warfare.

By killing enemy combatants?  Sorry, perfectly legal.  Anyways, what the
U.N. says really doesn't matter.  It's not a government, not by a long shot
(which is fortunate, since the entire operation demonstrates gross
incompetance).

American media is pro-palestinian, not pro-isreal.

You base your arguments on aether.

Whatever.  I'll file them with the rest of the information to sift through,
keep what's good, toss what's crap.  Though the BS to fact ratio isn't
looking too good in these sites.
