Yes, you are indeed a newbie! NEVER sell anything to a vendor that isn't a
common
drop off a low level mob. Use www.everlore.com and www.eqprices.com to get
an idea of what the item is actually worth before selling ANYTHING to either
a merchant
or a player. Do keep in mind though, that the prices listed at these sites
are usually
wrong (too high), but they are not a bad source to at least get an idea of
something's worth.
