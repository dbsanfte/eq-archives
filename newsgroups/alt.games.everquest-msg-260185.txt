I know many of you have popped in on Sigil and its forums for Vanguard. 
Tonight, they announced something pretty cool in my opinion.  On Oct 8th, 
they are sending 10 people from the community, all expenses paid, to a day 
long preview at their San Diego offices.  The best part is that the forum 
members get to pick the 10.  So, if you have visited the forums over the 
last year, you can get in on this.

Here is the link with the news release if your interested.

Note, in addition to the 10 above, 10 more are getting a free ride too. 
Each of the Vanguard fan sites gets to send one person.

Lastly, later that night, there will be a public get together at a local bar 
where any community member can show up and meet Sigil people and other fans 
as well as win one of 10 Beta slots up for grabs.   Note, dates for beta 
stages HAVE NOT BEEN SET YET but from all the signs, they are getting close 
to making an announcement.
