Dex is for Assassinations, 32,000 damage backstabs on humanoid mobs below
level 48.
This just isn't an issue anymore, with the evolving world and constantly
increased level mobs.

STA increases your HP, as you can visibly see.  STR increases your MAXIMUM
possible hit (along with ATK, mobs AC etc).

No stats particularly make or break a DPS class, if you put every training
point into WIS the chances are you'd be parsing the same damage as anybody
else, once you hit 65.

Having said that, any character I make now, I always dump points into STA.
This wasn't always the case though, and my original (and main) character had
his training points in Agility.. doesn't hinder him even 1 bit now though
