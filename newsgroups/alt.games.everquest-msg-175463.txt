      Here is the solution:  EverQuest: How do I get Alt +Tab to work for
Windows XP
      Windows XP keeps a list of program compatibility information. Up until
recently, EverQuest was not built to allow Alt + Tab, and so our executable
ended up in this list explicitly preventing the Alt + Tab functionality.
Obviously that has changed. We are working on getting that changed. But in
the meantime, if you are using Windows XP and you would like to enable Alt +
Tab, there is a way to get it to work.

      First, you'll need the Windows Application Compatibility Toolkit. It's
nearly 7 megs.

      You'll need to download and install the toolkit. Then:

      Open the Compatibility Administration Tool.

      At the top go to Search - Query.
      Search for EverQuest.
      Double click the item the search finds.
      Right-Click the EQGame.exe entry and choose Disable.
