OK - Lets hear from the Druids - When can you track corpses?  I have seen
corpses on my tracking but I have also not been able to see a groupmates
corpse on track when i was standing right next to it.

Does anyone know when this, ever so handy, skill works and does not work for
Druids.  Necros, Dark Knights and Bards - I don't care how it works for you,
lol!
