Find a spot in Marus Seru or Lake of Ill Omen devoid of other players
and go to town on the mobs (in LOIO there are places that are green or
partially green to a L23, but much of the zone will be blue to red).
As for sticking spells on the mobs, in LOIO at least the mobs seem to
have pretty poor resists, low reds have resisted maybe 50% of the
spells cast by my Shaman on Test.  With a 53 Druid to PL you really
just need a steady supply of killable mobs, ZEM isn't gonna be as big
a deal as having to stop because there's nothing left to kill, which
is just another reason to do your PLing away from other players.
Both LOIO and Marus Seru have lots of mobs without the big player
population of PC.
