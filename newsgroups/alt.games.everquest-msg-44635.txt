Yup, no group.  Most of my buds are mid-20s to mid-30s.

It sounds interesting, at least.  I may just jog on over and see if there
are others looking for some grouping entertainment.  I've pretty much soloed
him this far, but I think that part of his career is over.  I'm hoping the
people I meet will be a little smarter and understand grouping better at
this level, or are at least open to learning.  I may actually solo another
level or 2 in Oasis to get my 2HB up ( it's at 13, I think ), but I need to
go get my Abandoned Orc Shovel, first.

I have -never- set foot in S. Karana.  I tried soloing my Chanter in EK when
he was about level 17, I think, so I'm pretty familiar with that area.  I've
run through NK, but never hunted, and my very first character, a Wizzie,
hunted the bandits in WK.  Besides chasing Frostbite's ass to the named
bandits, that's my total experience of the Karanas.

I -like- dungeons so this could be a viable option.  Well, I did with my
chanter.  A warrior's perspective may be a little different.  I've never
been in Najena, so I may take a look there, too.

Many thanks - your replies are always appreciated.
