Have to agree, he appeared to do nothing wrong but then who's to say he
didn't see the giant and engage to try to steal or that he saw Furg fleeing
to zone where he despawns (from what I remember, Furg would rather flee than
fight) and decided to take him as he was going to be lost anyway.

Bad situation but you have learnt one thing, bring more next time, the end
part of this quest is really simple on paper but it never quite goes
according to plan.
I won't even begin to tell of the f*ck up my old guild made of it with about
8 players (all low 50's and high 40's) as it's too embarrassing.
