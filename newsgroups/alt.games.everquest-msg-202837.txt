<<<<<I've sat in <insert zone name for long camp> doing nothing but wait hours
and hours (on rare occasion days), with nothing but the company of my
friends to keep us all entertained.

Sure waiting  days for rage, a day for Lodi etc sucked ass, but friends
don't NEED endless killing to have fun, we made the most of it, and the
endless camp became almost bearable.>>>>>>>>

The camp became almost bearable?  This is how you choose to spend your free
time is doing something you find almost bearable or that "sucks ass"?  If
you're braindead enough to find that to be a worthwhile endeavor then more
power to you.  I liked having a KEI and being able to do more than sit around
and try and make things bearable.  I'd rather have real fun.

<<<Its nothing about feeling superior, KEI was DESTROYING the game, KEI on low
level people was also an EXPLOIT.  No ifs, no buts.  Now quit your damn
sniverlin old man.

-m?>>>>

Everybody who responds to me in this thread has said that KEI was destroying
the game but noone can give a reason.  I still fail to see how me and my buddy
and or group getting a KEI and fighting adversely affects your game experience
in any way.  The simple questions all remain unanswered.  Why do you care what
buffs I have on?
