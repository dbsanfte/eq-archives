to this day, i still really don't have a problem being asked for a sow, my
issues are all about how i am asked

and as to my other toons, i rarely worry about it unless i am on a long run
some where, say grobb to neriak, and then i just ask politely.  i am rarely
turned away, and i never sit and beg for one, if it ain't forthcoming, i
keep on going to where i want ot be
