DS damage was still unattributed as of last week or so, dunno about MoR
though.

(Bard powerlevelling: Pull huge train that are yellow to low red to your
PLee, stand still and twist PoV/WoZ for DS, AE snare/slow to keep aggro
and marr to regen, after a while have PLee run into middle of mobs and
click a holgresh mojo stick with cast force on it (5 charges PBAE DD of
100ish damage, droppable and often cheap in bazaar), wait for mobs to die
by DS, PLee get exp as the only one having dealt attributed damage)
