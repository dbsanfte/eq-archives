I run it.  It watches the log file for text events ("You have..") and makes
a sound depending on the trigger.  Mine tells me when SoW has dropped or my
DE illusion is fading; when ID fails, or when my weapon procs and so on.  I
get text messages for all these things but with fast weapons, item haste,
etc - I'm often just a blur of attack spam.  (And that's with all others
hits/misses, my misses, serverfilter..).  My colours are chosen fairly well,
but still don't always show up when I sometimes like to have the window
transparent for fullest view.
It simply helps me pay better attention.  It doesn't actually *do* anything
for me.

At no point does it access the web (Zonealarm verifies) so it's not any sort
of packet sniffer or password stealer.  The auther consistently says he will
never include any form of macroing.

Um, Dan - if you've never heard of it, why do you assume it's for cheating?
Bit harsh, no?
