Marcel,

Welcome!  As a more experienced beastlord, I can tell you that the
advice you read is somewhat misleading.  As I recall, your bare fists
are somewhat poor weapons compared to most of what else is available to
you.  Although the stats of "your bare hands" will improve as you gain
levels, you are generally better off using a weapon.  (FYI, there are
no attacks in the game that "disarm" a player, so you don't need to
worry about keeping up this skill on, say, a ranger in case he drops
his weapon.)  There are actual weapons out there which use the "Hand to
Hand" skill (also called Martial Weapons in other contexts, for reasons
unknown to me).  Think of them like brass knuckles, for example.

Moreover, I recommend using a variety of weapons.  Beastlords can use
Hand to Hand, 1-handed Blunt (e.g. clubs and maces) and 1-handed
Piercing (e.g. daggers) weapons, and there are good weapons to be had
from all three classes.  I recommend not ignoring any of them, since
you never know what great new weapon you might stumble across.  I have
used all three types as my primary weapon at various times, as I
leveled up.  In fact, I think I mainly used clubs and daggers at lower
levels.

As an aside, you can also use 2-handed Blunt weapons (e.g. staff, big
mallet).  Personally, I have not used these much.  Once you gain the
ability to dual wield at level 17, your damage output is usually
greater using two 1-handed weapons than a 2-handed weapon.  At higher
levels, there are some reasons to use slow, heavy-hitting 2-handed
weapons, but none of those affect you right now.  For now, just pick
the best weapon you can find that you can wield.  At low levels, "best"
can be simply defined as getting the ratio of Damage/Delay to be as
high as possible (or Delay/Damage as low as possible) - dishing out the
most damage in the shortest time.

It used to be true that Hand to Hand weapons were "better" for a
beastlord.  At one time, we were able to attain a higher maximum skill
with HtH weapons than with any other class of weapons.  This is no
longer true - we can now attain the same high level of skill in all
weapon types allowed to us.  This may have been why that guide was
trying to steer you towards HtH weapons.
