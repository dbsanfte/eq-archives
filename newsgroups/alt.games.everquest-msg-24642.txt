How little you know my meek, orc slaying friends...
I wouldn't make these claims, or take any sort of moral highground on
anybody, if I didn't:
a) work a fulltime, fairly well paying job (thats 8 hr/day... about
the same time you spend attacking goblins)
b) spend an additional 4-6 hr/day studying performance music (as much
time as you spend thinking about attacking goblins)
c) 2-3 hours a day having a social life (you might want to check the
dictionary for that one)
d) 1-4 hours a day spend with members of the opposite sex (believe me,
no matter what they tell you, they don't like video games)

In any case there guys, I take a high ground because, simply put, I am
the high ground.  So keep playing there kids... and in 20 years, look
back at the beautiful, incredible lessons of life you have learned
from Everquest and prove me wrong.
