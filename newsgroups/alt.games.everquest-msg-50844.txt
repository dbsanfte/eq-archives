It's not *necessary* to have Lev to get into (or out of) CC.  Follow
the path through the pit, jumping off onto the next bridge down.
Pretty easy if you look where you're going.   It is *necessary* to
either have Invis or fight your way down, though.

To get out on foot, you run through the geonid caverns.  As
long as you don't kill them, you shouldn't be KoS.
