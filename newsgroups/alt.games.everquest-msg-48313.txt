 Agreed! I love going to new places, however, I'd rather not do it
alone. There's nothing I like better than going to a new place I've
never explored yet, I was one of the first to go into Stonebrunt
with a few friends. Got my ass handed to me by a few of those Mountain 
Gorilla guys but hey! it was a lot of fun. If my heart isn't beating 
a little above normal and my palms aren't sweaty, I'm a bit bored and
looking for excitement.
