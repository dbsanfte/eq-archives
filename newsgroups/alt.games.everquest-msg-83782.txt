How often do you see Tylerdurden?  I honestly had no idea what that was 
referring to until you mentioned it the first time, but maybe because I 
somehow missed Fight Club.  Since I didn't know that name violated the 
naming policy, it certainly wouldn't have bothered me.  

Of course you want to know where you say that they need to enfore the 
rules completely, so a quick google search turned up these little bon 
mots:

from 
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=+name+OR+policy+group:alt.games.everquest+author:darktyger%40mindspring.com&hl=en&selm=92rqk5%24m6q%241%40slb6.atl.mindspring.net&rnum=15

And, if the rule is being violated by that name, they'll live with having 
it
changed. If their attachment to ANY name is strong enough that they are
somehow emotionally crushed by having to give it up, I say again, they 
need
SERIOUS help. It doesn't matter if there's a story or what behind the 
name,
there ARE rules, and they should be followed, period. It's not as though
following this rule violates any ethical codes or rights


And this one from 
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=+name+OR+policy+group:alt.games.everquest+author:darktyger%40mindspring.com&hl=en&selm=ask45u4ogpnsvt3lgpv5qku8r9ac668cuu%404ax.com&rnum=1

Yes, it's a violation. No question about it. It's not as though you
didn't know there was a brand name identical to the name you chose.
Excuses don't fly...

>How does that name hurt anyone or interfere with game play?  

Basicly, it breaks the atmosphere of the game. It's also breaking the
rules, which, in itself, damages gameplay.


And as to your statement that you didn't think that copywrited names were 
an issue, you're pretty damn forgetful since you mentioned it over a year 
ago:

http://groups.google.com/groups?q=+name+OR+policy+group:alt.games.everquest+author:darktyger%40mindspring.com&hl=en&selm=92rqri%24l18%241%40slb6.atl.mindspring.net&rnum=21

As for any copyright issues you were
implying earlier, neither Lokari nor myself recognized the refference, 
which
is why we would not petition it. It is also perfectly reasonable that the
name was cooked up without any knowledge of the refference you point out.

No, I'm a dickhead.  (White guy with a shaved head, you should see me in a 
turtleneck.)  I am over it.  I understand that certain things are up to 
individual interpretation, and I accept that.  I do petition obscene 
names, I don't petition stupid names.  It doesn't affect my enjoyment of 
the game.

Compare that to your own statement above, which I am repeating here:

Basicly, it breaks the atmosphere of the game. It's also breaking the
rules, which, in itself, damages gameplay.

You refer to the GUIDELINES as rules.  If you going to be splitting hairs 
over terminology when it suits you, at least be consistant.
