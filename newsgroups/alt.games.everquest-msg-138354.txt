Also:

AC>all* for a melee player, even a rogue.  Ditch the Serpentine
bracer for something (even a hardened kodiak bracer is
better) with more AC.

And don't sell an Iksar Regen BP...even if you end up with
a better AC BP down the line, keep the regen BP in a bag
or something for inevitable downtime.  Healing naturally
sucks.

Trade those Jagged Bands out for some 6/65 rings as soon
as you get the plat...5 ac and str is good, but an extra 130 hps
and 2 extra ac is better.

Don't worry about the -5 to fire resist on the Shadowed Dagger.
If your fire resist is close enough that +/- 5 makes a difference,
you're over your head anyways.

Kylong legs are the best bargin out there for a pre-50 rogue.
Drop the stat pants and get some chain on those legs...

*don't worry about the lack of AC on a Sash of the Dragonborn.
Haste is special...whatever better haste item you can find will
be better than any other thing in that slot...sash is 25% haste
and will last you up to your epic.




















































enough hints? ;-)
