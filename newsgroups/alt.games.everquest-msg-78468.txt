For what it's worth there is a small lake in the town of Halas up north that
one must swim or take the boat over to get to the actual town.  There are no
piranah nor anything else in the water and it is a convenient place to
practice swimming.

Also, freeport has some sewers areas that are just deep enough for one to
swim in.  The docks area around butcherblock is also devoid of creatures
that want to nibble you.
