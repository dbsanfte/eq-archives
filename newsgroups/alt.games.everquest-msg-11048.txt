Into the currently existing zones?  Probably not.  In fact, I'm fairly
sure I recall Brad assuring everyone that current zones on current
servers will not be getting Warrens-type looting rules.  However, it
is apparent that the two upcoming servers, the "open PvP" and
"roleplay" servers will have these rules implimented in most zones.
Also, it's likely that Shadows of Luclin will have this feature built
into it.
