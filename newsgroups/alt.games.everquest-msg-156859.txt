I didnt solo between 16 and 49 with my enchanter. With the lvl 49 pet,
soloing is a breeze, but it does get harder by 53, and the lvl 55 pet isnt
that much of an improvement. I could solo stuff in the mid 40's I suppose
still (currently 57), but in my case its quicker to park next to my druid
and leach off quadding. Im constantly in zones with plenty of <6 groups and
no other chanters, and noone wants me cos they all have KEI, and my haste
isnt worth my share of the xp I guess.
