Hi, all
I play lvl 45 druid, I realized that I was out of batwings and went to
rivervale
to buy some off newbie players.
I remember when I was just starting EQ, some high level ppl bought
batwings from me and that helped me a lot.

So, I shouted WTB batwings, 5pp per stack.
And there was a very smart person telling me that I can buy them
2 silver per wing in Freeport.
I told him I wanted to buy from newbie players because I want to help
them.
And he started arguing that I should buy belts from them for faction or
someting
and so on.

Well, I just need batwings and I want to help newbies while I'm at it.
Why do some ppl get so annoyed when I'm buying batwings from newbies?
Is it such a horrible thing to do?
Please someone enlighten me.
