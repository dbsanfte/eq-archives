*boggle*  Ok...  Too bad we can't get a show of hands of who doesn't have
cable modem/DSL.  While it is the greatest invention since sliced bread and
Pizza for us computer gamers...  I know quite a few dozen people who can't
afford Cable/DSL or justify it at this time, or just plain can't get it in
their area at this time.  So you propose...  That those people who don't
have Cable/DSL, to sit there...  Spend over two days to DL the stuff they
need to play those expansions if they want it for free.

Were you dropped when you were a kid?  Like several times?  Yes, some
companies are currently doing this, I think Aces of Angels or some such.
Some of those companies, I am not too sure of, and more so, they haven't
exactly pumped out a lot of stuff since then towards the thing they are
currently pushing.  The next closest model to Everquest is its predecessor,
Ultima Online, which has just now pumped out its 3rd(?) UO title, and I am
not even sure if it 'melds' with the previous iterations.

Have you even LOOKED at the size of the files for Luclin?  If you thought
the DLing when Luclin came out was horrendous, what... with the 10k people
hammering, at the very least, on the patch server and login server alone...
The time it would take with those same 10k people trying to get the files
to DL the latest expansion, the one that came on 3 CDs...  The one that had
a lot more than just what was DLed by the patcher the first day it came
out...  Well, even with cable modem, you are looking at hours of DLing.
And given the fact that places like Fileplanet and such are now pushing the
'You are # in line to DL this...', you can't exactly conviently place your
computer on and running while you are off at work to dl this and hope you
get it all should something like a network interruption or some idiot
driving his car into a power substation (Which, btw, I heard that happen to
one guy who WAS playing EQ)

Even distributed to mirror sites, you are still looking at places that will
not handle the load of an initial release, but then, I guess you haven't
been trying to hammer the login server just as it comes up from a patch
fix, or DL a demo just as it hits the net during primetime hours...  Where
trying to find a fileserver that isn't busy.  Heck... I do searches for
Anime sites that won't let me in because of the almighty 'Too many users
connected' message.  But hey...  If we could live in your ideal world, it
wouldn't be reality.
