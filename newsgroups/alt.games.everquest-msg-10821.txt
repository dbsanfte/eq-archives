Hi All,

    I have a level 54 necro and I am not happy with my char. any more. I
feel like my char. did a complete 180 after 50. Anyway what I am looking to
do is start over with a new char.. I have narrowed it down to one race I
want to be "Half Elf" (Thay look really cool in plate) and for the class it
going to be Ranger/Bard/Warrior. My question is what class is most wanted in
groups at higher levels. And what class still has satisfaction after 50. I'm
leaning twordes the Ranger because of spells and tracking, but the sheer AC
and HP of a warrior sounds nice, but then again with out slam it might be
tough. I just dont know....... Thanks in advance.

Robert
