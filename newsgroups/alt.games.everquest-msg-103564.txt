I removed mine 2 nights ago.  Only saw one guide on, but went ahead
and petitioned.  Very politely.  5 minutes later, he responded, asking
why.  I commented that after 25 levels with it I truly hated my
surname, found it useless, juvenile and annoying.  He asked if I knew
that I'd need to re-petition if I ever wanted another surname.  I
thanked him for that, and said it was pretty unlikely.  He said, "Ok,
I'll pass it along to the GM for a decision".

10 minutes later, the GM (who I still couldn't see in a /who all GM!)
showed up and removed the surname.

Total time invested:  15 minutes.  :-)

My bard is next to lose his surname next time he get's trotted out for
duty.
