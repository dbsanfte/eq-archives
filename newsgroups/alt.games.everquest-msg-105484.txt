The reverse question is how do you stop druids from <quickdrawing> your
intended mob and other much more annoying practices? Snare is very quick to
cast, so very often Chimp is lining up a spiroc, looking left, looking right
<all clear>, then starts to cast Dooming Darkness...then has a scratch,
gets's a new beer and reads the paper waiting for the casting delay (j/k). A
wolf form blurs past and throws off a snare which lands before Dooming
Darkness is finished casting, so Chimp has to rock back and forward to
interrupt the cast. This happens again and again, and there are no "z" axis
issues there either so they can see exactly what they are doing to.

I know enough about druid kiting to realise why they throw manners (it's
perfectly legal BTW, if I let Dooming Darkness land I would be the KS'er) to
the wind , they have a limited time to get all the intended mobs
engaged/snared and rounded into a tight group and AoE'd before snare wears
off. In their mind I guess a static single puller is on no time limit and
can just happily wait for the next pop. What I can't figure out is the
mental leap taken by them in getting from their multikiting need to
everyones elses concern?

Over the weekend there was a stack of us at the treehouse, two mellee duo's,
a soloing mage and the Gimp along with 2 druids who would drive by for no
less that 5 spirocs at a time. The thing was, they would get pissed off if
there weren't at least 5 there waiting for them on a platter. One had the
hide to OOC that the campers were hogging all the spirocs because he only
got 2 spirocs which "weren't worth kiting". What he didn't realise was he
just missed another druid who took 6 spirocs to multikite by about a minute.

He then got pissy waiting for his 6 mobbs to pop and when he got them,
proceded to run them all over the static campers - to no effect btw - no-one
was engaged at the time as we were waiting for the confirmed idiot to clear
out first.

Kiting, especially multi kiting is a two edged sword. Sure it fun and
effective, but if done without the utmost consideration it will generate a
huge amount of ill will...
