I'm thinking of re-activating my son's old account and try my hand at
2-boxing since it sounds like so much fun.

I've heard a lot and read a bit about both WinEQ and EQW, but don't know
enough about puters'n stuff to decide which would suit me best.

Anyone have the time to point out the major differences between the two or
the pros and cons of each, please?

TIA and regards,
