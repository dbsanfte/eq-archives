I feel your pain.  You really should try a number of other characters
besides Warrior before dumping that $150.00 investment.

I had a very similar experience when I first started EQ.  My original
characters were:  Erudite Shadowknight (got him to level 6), human
bard (got him to level 6 also), and gnome wizard (got him to level
16).  The Shadowknight was just really tough to play (at the time I
didn't know what a bad combo that was).  The bard hit a wall similar
to what the poster was saying at level 6.
Anything blue or even I attacked made lunch of me.  The big problem
was I didn't know exactly how to play the bard (just war song and
tank) and had no money for any equipment.  The wizard I got to 16 but
sitting on your butt all day looking at a spellbook was REALLY BORING.
 I tried a number of other character combos but didn't play them much
above 3rd or 4th level.

I quit EQ and didn't play it for a number of months.  After Luclin
came out, a friend bought it for me thinking I still played EQ.  I
tried it again but this time tried a kitty Shaman.  What a big
difference!  The Shaman was fun to play.  He had good spells, could
tank abit and much less downtime.  Once he got SOW, I was hooked.  The
game became easy and fun.  I've been playing off and on ever since.

So try some other character combos out.  You might hit on one that
really clicks for you.
