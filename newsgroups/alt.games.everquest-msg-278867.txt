Yes.  =)

Leave one tank and one or two clerics as a suicide crew and move everyone
else out of range when they're about to spawn.  Monks make good dps for the
suicide crew since they can FD soon as the split happens.  Have a rogue grab
the bodies, rez and rebuff the 3 people that die.  Send your monks to split
the spiders and enjoy the singles.

Nowadays I'd just bull through that event, but back when PoP was new that
was how we managed to limit the losses of what is a nasty fight when you
first come to it.

We also didn't (maybe couldn't) mez the horde, so we had a bard kite them on
the island they spawn on.  All the above action occurs down at the 4-way.
