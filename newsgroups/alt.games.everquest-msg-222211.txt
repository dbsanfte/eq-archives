Yeah, same thing (missed notes/fizzles).  You fizzle a LOT when your
spell/song skill is much lower than the spell level (ask any wizard right
after Verant gave them familiars).  Same thing with songs.  Everyone has a
chance to fizzle...the chance goes down when your skill is maxed.  Not a lot
else has a NOTICEABLE affect on that.  DEX or CHA or even STA (who knows,
who cares? :) ) might very well have some sort of minor statistical affect,
but no empirical affect.

As for buying & selling & stuff (to answer another post in this thread),
just buy two opal encrusted steins.  On Zeb they usually sell for less than
50p each and give you a LOT of CHA (maybe 25 each, I don't feel like looking
it up). :p

Sucks that you wasted 4k. :(
