True, but what right do you have to demand that your fellow players
sacrifice the plat they need to buy their own upgrades so that you can have
that pleasure?

And, to add some prespective to what I've been saying... I'm a paladin who's
soloed since the day I stepped out of LoIO, with an absolute disgust for
pickup groups and "level train" areas.  Since then, I've fought mainly in
the mines of Thurgadin, the Combine Spires in OT, and the underbulks and
Tasky in Echo Caverns.  In other words, very poor areas, in terms of cash
and loot.  My gear is downright pittiful... I'm still swinging a weighted
polearm.  I stand against pure NBG, even though I probably stand to benefit
more than anyone else out there.  In my mind, it would be greedy for me to
use my need as leverage against my fellow players' time.
