That's why I said they are like the French. Not every assling drood or ikky
monk is an asshole but there are enough of them arround to develop a
reputation.

Generaliastion is apparently a nasty word when dealing with people, let's
just say if I was a Bookie running odds on whether someone was going to be
an asshole or not, the odds would be different for a assling druid, ikky
monk or a French person. There, we can talk odds can't we, that's not PC
evil is it? : )

BTW - If you were the Bookie, what odds would you give a Frenchman playing
an Assling Drood.....  : O
