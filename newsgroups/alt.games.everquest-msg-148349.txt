Except one pitfall about the LCD Monitor is the price. Since I am in
Canada, they are not cheap at all. They cost over $1200 and up to buy.
Then you add the 15% tax on it and that can break the bank account.

These LCD monitors are available to businesses only, it also means
that the end user like you and me are stuck with CRT monitors for the
time being, until the prices come down. It will never happen for
awhile.

Oh well.
