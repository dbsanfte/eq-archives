The Gavel of Justice, if you've ever done that quest you know how long
it takes to get the beads. Useless piece of equipment, but I was
really attached to it.

I also really liked my Barnacle Breastplate. I only wore it on special
occasions, but it was a really pretty shade of blue, before you could
dye your locations. Wore it to a wedding once. It took a long time to
convince those Erud Pallys that my Barb Shammy really did want to help
them with their shark problem. :)
