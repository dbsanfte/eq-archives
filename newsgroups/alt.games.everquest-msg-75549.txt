There is nothing wrong with running EQ and Win98SE. Your problem is
not the OS. 

Are the crashes predictable? Do you crash after 10mins or while zoning
for example? 

How do you connect to the Internet (modem, cable, DSL)? 

What other programs do you have running in the background when you
play EQ? (anti-virus, software firewall, ICQ, etc)

Tackle the problem as if you were starting from scratch. Download and
install the following:

In your system BIOS make check the following settings:
AGP Aperture size = 128mb (you can try also try 64 or 256 if all else
fails, but 128 should be the safest setting with 512MB RAM)
AGP Fastwrites = DISABLED
AGP = 4X (if supported, if not 2X is fine)
All Shadowed items = DISABLED

1. Download and install the latest version of Microsoft's DirectX
(version 8.1):
www.microsoft.com/directx

REBOOT

2. Download and install the latest SBLive! Driver for Win98
http://www.soundblaster.com/support/drivers/welcome.asp?reg=0&OS=Win98&prod=sblive&Select=Get+Files&x=69&y=12

REBOOT

3. Download and unzip the latest Radeon Driver to a folder on your PC
http://www.rage3d.com/files/drivers/radeonbeta.shtml#9005
I would recommend the 4.13.7199 driver for your Radeon.

4. COMPLETELY unistall all previous video driver versions, and remove
old registry entries (use this guide):
http://www.rage3d.com/forum/ubbhtml/Archives/Archive-000001/HTML/20010104-13-004006.html

REBOOT

5. When the system asks for the driver disk point it to the
folder you extracted the 4.13.7199 driver to and let the system
install the files.

REBOOT

6. Adjust the screen resolution and other video settings to your
liking.

7. Test EQ for stability

The above should take about an hour including DL times if you have a
connection faster than 56K. If after doing all of the above the system
is still not stable. Post back and we can go from there.

Good Luck!
