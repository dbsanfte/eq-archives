}Equality is a result not a premise.

Well, I think the example in the other post demonstrates how equality does 
not necessarily result, and how that's a direct result of the fact that 
people are not equal to start with (ie, some are more psycho than others).  
So, equality would result, if we assume equality as a premise, don't you 
see?

Personally, I do lean toward an 'it should be legal' stance.  but utting 
down or avoiding baggage is a good thing, too.  The fear seems to result 
mostly from believing that their experience of what works and what doesn't 
will not be consulted when the baggage is agreed upon.  This seems a 
perfectly reasonable fear to me.

The odd thing is, a couple of the girls I met actually did pay taxes on 
the money they earned, because they believed it was right to do so.  Even 
though this meant they had to engage in clever and illegal money- 
laundering schemes to make the money show up as legitimate income.

Changes in income was generally much less of a concern than having the 
government intrude in their affairs.  Odd that the government would seem 
to be less of an intrusion in an illegal market than a legal one, but that 
was their perception.

But getting back to the moral issue, I really don't think it's possible to 
make a blanket statement that sex for money is inherently bad.  It 
certainly doesn't violate my personal moral code, even though I've never 
done it.
