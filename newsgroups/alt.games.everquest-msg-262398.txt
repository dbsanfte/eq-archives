Personally, I think we should just totally pull out of Iraq. And every other 
country where we now have troop stationed, for any reason.

Let the UN handle it all. And France.

We all know how well the UN has done in the past, and by pulling all of our 
forces out worldwide, we would not piss anyone off so the terrorists would 
blow up someone else.

In fact, let's pull out of the UN also - that has been nothing but a total 
money drain for years, and I cannot recall one single thing the UN has ever 
done for the US.
