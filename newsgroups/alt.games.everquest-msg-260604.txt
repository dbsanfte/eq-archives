But if I'm hitting an average blue mob, I'm not busy thinking about 
which discipline to use, I'm busy killing it and trying to talk the 
cleric out of using spot heals or HOTs on me.

Since I can only use an offensive discipline every 25 minutes, I save 
them for hard targets, even if this means I don't use them at all for 
several hours running.

Its very likely that the mob I'm attacking is yellow or red to me, if 
things are either A) desperate enough or B) important enough to burn my 
discipline.

Thats not always going to be true, I'm sure.  For example, I was doing a 
POJ trial last night, and the MT got slowed and the cleric wasn't quick 
about curing him.  We managed to get that mob down in time, but cleric 
was memming cure and its going to take him three casts... so I blew my 
offensive disc to pick up the slack.  Here I was on a blue mob, and 
hitting fairly regularly, so I should have hit Cleaving which would have 
made all my hits crits... but my newly formed conclusion that Inspired 
is better in general was hanging in my mind, and thats what I used.

It worked, we killed the mob within the time limit... but it would 
probably have worked better to go all crits.  I'm still learning.
