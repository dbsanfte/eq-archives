Along with any INT caster, no argument.  But I see rangers much more often
getting aggro more often and for longer periods of time.  Rangers who think
that hitting the Taunt button is somehow a good idea (/boggle) when they
aren't MT.

Druid snares early...takes some hits while the MT gets its attention back.
Bad aggro management happened and dealt with.  Ranger beat on critter...gets
aggro.  Does nothing but continue to beat on the critter expecting the
cleric to heal them.

But as TH said, anyone who can't manage aggro dies.  Some idiot players need
to learn the lesson by dying a few times.  Unfortunately most clerics
continue to keep idiot players playing rangers alive, so in their 50s they
still haven't learned how to manage it.
