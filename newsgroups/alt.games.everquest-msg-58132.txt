the only times I have had HT resisted was on reds that were 7 to 10 levels
higher than me, its never been resisted by yellow con and lower

it *is*  (10*Level)+1, then at 40 the increase changes dramatically

i'm not sure what the formula is, but at 45 its hitting for 551..... if I
find the formula I'll post it for ya
