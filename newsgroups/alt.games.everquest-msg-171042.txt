Do NOT follow Chain Smoker's tip and try the cougars in Iceclad at 36
unless you are severely twinked in +mana gear. They will abuse you
greatly. ;-)

I quadded 36 to 40 or so on the drakkel dire wolves in GD, up in the
corner of the zone between Thurg and the EW zone valley. Several good
spots to med, usually tons of wolves, and they are excellent quadding
fodder. After that you can move into EW and do the walrus and ulthorks
into your late forties.

You're using the right spells, so don't worry about it. If you don't
have a staff of temperate flux yet, get one. Use it to aggro and round
up four wolves, run in wide circles (steering clear of possible adds)
until they are all bunched up. Cast BoF and keep rounding up and snaring
until all are snared at once and in a tight bunch. Then just AoE them
until they all drop.
