   Nope.  Gandalf ends up naked and without any memory of his 
spells.  Or his name, for that matter.  Anyways, he clearly
died, and returned to his bind spot.  Luckily, a passing druid
in Eagleform was able to port him to Galadriel, who obliged
him by twinking him out and sending on his way.
    The Balrog?  Probably still there.  And dropping a nice
haste item or something, I should imagine.
