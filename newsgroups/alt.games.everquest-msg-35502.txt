At 47th I rarely get exp from beserkers (rarely but it does happen, they are
all green to me) at 46th I was still getting Exp from some of them. At 45th
I got exp from at least half of them and some were still blue.
At 44th you should get exp from most of the beserkers and the Sarnak Braids
are actually good exp as well. I'd make a point of hunting them, if I were
you.
As a necro there are obviously better mobs in the zone to hunt for exp but
if you see a Beserker, grab it...that's my suggestion, anyway
