I am a half elf rogue who worships Bristlebane.  Does anyone know, or is
there a place/chart anywhere that can give me an idea what my faction is
likely to be in the dark cities like Ogguk, Cabilis, Neriak etc...  I would
like to broaden my horizons but like to have some idea of what I am getting
myself into before I head out.

Thanks
