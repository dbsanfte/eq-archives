I connect to the internet using an ADSL router (Netgear RT314) with an
Alcatel Speedtouch ADSL modem,  it is a 512/128 link - ample for 2 EQ
connections.  Network cards in both machines are Realtek (sp?) with the
latest upgrade drivers from MS.  Both machines have Win 98 SE.

Will check all this out, although most of it I have already done.  I do
suspect a faulty mother board though.  This machine worked fine until the
original Mobo blew.  It was replaced with one exactly the same but we never
had lockups before (have always had the P/L problem).  Problem is, it only
has trouble with EQ so I can't reproduce the trouble in the shop on their
test bench.  Blasted Quake 3 runs for hours without a hitch!
