I did the same with my Pally.  I think he was at level 6 when I restarted.  I
was doing ok with good armor and helm someone gave me for free.  He was just
getting rid of it.  But then I lost it all when I fell into Pit Trap at
Blackburrow.  I made lots of mistake with my first character so I gave my
second Pally a little boost to get going.  Twinking at low level like that
helps level up little faster.  But what really helps is the knowledge of where
to go, and what to hunt to get maximum experience points and money, and not
slightly better weapons or armor.

There are people Guild one can join and receive better armor and weapons.  Some
people  power boost there character.  With my Shammy I routinely giveaway SOW
if they ask me.  There are lots of players who will help you if you ask.  Like
one time I died deep with in Befallen.  There was no way I could have retrieved
my corps naked!  But higher-level player who was passing by brought my corps
out for me.  Is all that cheating too?  Don't feel guilty.  What you passed
from one character to next were earned by you.
