From the shadows, the mysterious ez064842@vici.ucdavis.edu (Remington
Stone) (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Heh. I've been in there a lot lately, in fact, if I haven't crashed again, 
>my trader is probably there now. :)  What I've thought would be helpful is 
>if there was a list somewhere cross-indexing people's name in the channel 
>with the name we know them from in the newsgroup.  Sure, most of us have 
>our character name in the signature, but I find that I never remember 
>them.  Well, except for a few, like Teapray, Lenny, Meems, and Monual.  

Some of them are names that aren't seen in the newsgroup much anymore.
Aluaeia for example is Ben Haddick who used to be a regular.


>But I'd never know which name means "Ben Sisson", for example.

These days, Taralynn/Teilie will be my ranger and paladin respectively
(and Harebell the druid if I an playing two accounts at once). But I
am easy enough to identify usually as the one from test.
