I just logged in. To Antonius Bayle. Man, what a weird feeling...

My US friends are GONE. I won't be raiding with them, ever again. Sure,
I can (and will) make an alt and go chat with them and stuff, but it
will never be the same. When I saw my characters on the AB login screen,
I thought "great, no more raids going on into the morning." But when I
actually logged on my main, tears welled up. Damnit, I'm a guy, I'm not
supposed to get emotional, at least not over little things like this!

This is gonna be tough...

Rune
