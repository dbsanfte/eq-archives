Yes, you could handle them.  You could have handled them 10 levels
ago.  Bloodgill Goblins range from around level 35 up to 40, with most
seeming to be 37-40 (I've only occasionally seen the ones below 37).
However, they only have 1300-1400 hitpoints.  Most things of those
levels have 2500-3500 or so hitpoints.

My 50 Wizard is hunting them now.  A single Ice Comet knocks them down
to "run away slowly" range, and then a 320 point Shock of Ice finishes
them.  Total mana 560.  It only takes a couple minutes to med that
back.  (Although I don't med it back right after...I do three or four
in a row, then have a longer med session).  (At 50, 37 and above is
blue).

Watch out for the Bloodgill Barracudas.  Those things, as far as HP
and how hard they hit, are basically swimming Hill Giants.  I'm sure
you have no trouble with HG's at your level...but you probably still
don't like it when they jump you in the middle of something.
