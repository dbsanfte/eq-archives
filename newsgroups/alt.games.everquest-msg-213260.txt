I don't want better, but if yours needed changing from 72min to 30-odd, then
so did mine.
I invested 16 or so AA's in that worthless skill

"were not giving melees any more HP or AC, but don't worry! Clerics will get
6k heals to keep up with mob damage"

That makes me feel soo much better! =)

Significant, for 6 ticks or so.  Thats so leet =)

Well fair enough - my shaman is used to having his HoT's zapped by the
cleric MGB heal, so the issue doesnt exist there.
And clerics can just use words of replenishment - a better spell !

Which mobs require CR and SotW at the SAME time?!
Its one or the other...  and druids little speciality for making nasty ae
raids happen, by ae healing a nice spell, is now no longer not special, its
not the best either.

Shrug I don't want overpowering no matter how much it improves or helps me.
If shamans had a 6k/2cast heal, I'd say the same.  And thats with jak always
by my side!
