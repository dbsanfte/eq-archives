Hmmmm.  To start over again.  Hmmm.  Not sure.  Been playing a Halfling
cleric.  Got him up to 38th level.  Possibly another one.  Possibly a Wood
Elf druid.  Not sure.

What I really hope is that they require you to have leveled a character to
at least 20th level on another server before being allowed to come onto the
RP server.  This will get rid of a lot of the newbie questions and will
enable people to more immerse themselves into roleplaying.
