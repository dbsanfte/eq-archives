  Don't forget that Alteration is also used in roots, snares and
teleports in addition to healing spells.  These spells are more
"clutch" than nukes and DoTs.  You don't want to fizzle an evac twice
in a row, afterall.

  But to answer your question, the quests you refer to begin in the
Temple of Ro (neighboring Lavastorm).  The quest involves making you
"forget" your advanced knowledge of specialization (thus, you lose all
skill built in specialization from that point forward).  I've never
done the quest so I don't know the specifics, but somebody here will
probably reply in greater detail, or you could just look it up on the
web.
