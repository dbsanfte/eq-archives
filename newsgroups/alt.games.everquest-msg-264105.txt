Well, the potential is that Sony has learned a lot from running EQ for many
years, and from observing what has happened to the MMORPGs that have
followed EQ.

Leaving out Final Fantasy and Lineage, because they seem to mostly be Asian
games, and even in the US they seem to attract a different kind of player
than EQ-type games, we've had the following since EQ:

    AC.  Did OK for a while, but is fading.  Might linger at 50k subscribers
    for a long time.

    DAoC.  Successful (250k subscribers) and has staying power (they just
    had their third anniversary).

    AO.  Horrible launch.  Never recovered from that.  Limping along at 40k.

    Shadowbane.  Quickly shot to an unspectacular 40k subscribers, and
    stayed there.

    SWG.  In absolute numbers, a success (300k?), although considering their
    expectations, and their higher costs, it might actually be considered a
    failure inside Sony.  Not been out long enough to know if it has long
    term staying power.

    Horizons.  Only hit about 35k, then started falling off.  Company in
    Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

    CoH.  Quickly shot up to 175k.  Hasn't been out long enough to see how
    they will do long term.

Although WoW isn't out yet, because the NDA was lifted so early in the beta,
there is a *lot* of information about it available, and player's reactions
to it.  It is pretty safe to say that it is going to do well, unless they
have a launch disaster comparable to AO (or Luclin).

That's a lot of information available to Sony about what works and doesn't
work in an MMORPG, and what things can be improved from EQ1.

Here are some things I think might be lessons from those other games:

    From DAoC: (1) consider some kind of PvP endgame, instead of a "fight
    bigger monsters" endgame.  The "fight bigger monsters" endgame can be
    won, and then you end up raising level limits, and stuff like that, to
    keep your high level players, and things can get out of hand (like in
    EQ1).  For a PvP endgame, you can get away with just adding some kind of
    alternate advancement to keep the high level players busy (like "Trials
    of Atlantis" in DAoC, although a lot of people were annoyed with that),
    (2) Get good infrastructure.  DAoC almost never has routine patches
    go way over schedule, or cause problems.  They deploy on the test
    server, test them, and then smoothly go live.

    From AO: (1) Go back and underline point #2 from DAoC.  Nearly everyone
    I've heard talk about AO has said it was a good game.  But they just
    never recovered from that bad launch.

    From most of the post-EQ games: (1) don't make the game too slow.  EQ1
    had waaaaay too much sitting on your ass healing/medding.  I think every
    game that has followed has had much less downtime, and since there are
    several successes there, and I don't think any of the failures can be
    attributed to too little downtime, lowering downtime seems to be a good
    idea.

    From CoH: (1) massive character customization is good.  It is really
    cool to be able to tell everyone in a large collection of players apart
    by their costumes.

I bet there is a lot to learn from Shadowbane and Horizons, but I did not
play either of those, nor do I know anyone in RL who has played them, so
can't comment.
