A few nights ago I was banking after killing some mobs in Paludal with a 
group.

While banking, I suddenly saw myself lying on the floor lying dead, and saw 
the message; "Pain and suffering strike you"

I never knew what hit me, I had full heatlh, full mana, and NO disease from 
the Fiends in Paludal. I did a /Petition with the whole story and was 
contacted 4 hours later by some GM who asked if I was the one filing that 
petition, I confirmed that, and after 5 minutes he came back to me and 
stated he couldn't find anything, and that he was sorry, but he couldn't do 
anything.

I even left my corpse lying there at the bank in Paludal, but after that I 
just looted my final items, and forgot to find a cleric friend to resurrect 
me.

But anyone has *any* idea of what *could* have happened there???

Thanks in advance,

Khalistro
