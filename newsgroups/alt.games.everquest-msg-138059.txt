It is almost impossible for *any* class to work in well with a quadder,
except another quadder, and even then your timing has to be flawless.
Non quadders don't understand this, and can sometimes be put off if the
quadding party doesn't want to invite them to group. It's SO easy to
screw up a quad it's not funny. My necro partner and I tried everything
we could think of and nothing was feasible.

So, in the end, when hunting in a good quadding area, we basically just
solo in a group of two and share the xp, knowing there is some backup on
hand if things go wrong. I start out by pulling a quad and just quad
them in a circle until I drop them in front of the necro and we both get
the xp.  She's there to help with the RIP mobs, as you say, or to pick
off an add if I get five. When my quad is done, necro goes and pulls
singles back to the pet while I med and I share the xp on those. Plus
I'm there for backup help on snares/roots for particularly MR pulls, or
a timely nuke if a fight goes south.

"Sharing the duties" in a quad is difficult at best, and impossible as
the norm.
