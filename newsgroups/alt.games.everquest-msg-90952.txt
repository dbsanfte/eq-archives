100% agree - people expect a 24/7 service and for something as
complicated as this is just not possible - unless everyone want to pay
more so that the development teams can spend the time to make sure
every patch is 100% backwardly compatible, so they can patch servers
one at a time.

Even then, people would complain because 'their' server was taken down
during US time when they are a UK player - so that is fixed by having
regional servers, then they complain because they are restricted to
only play on UK servers!! 

Basically - 99.9% of people have not got a clue about the complexities
of running this kind of service (and I don't profess to either -
though I do work in IT for a Co that runs services at a EU/middle east
level  -  broader portfolio of apps - and that is F-ing complicated).

I do think that  Verant could do more on the communication front
though, it is the only way to compensate for customers who are
basically ignorant of the nuances.
