The other day, while hunting my Shaman in OT, a guildmate was talking about a
move he just made.  He's not real happy with it, and so to get off the subject,
he said, "Ask me something else."

Being the smartass I am, I replied, "What's three times eight?"

A moment later, the whole guild started shouting, "24," "Go back to school,"
and (for one genius) "32,"  and I couldn't figure out why.

I'd asked my smartass question in /ooc instead of /gu.  I could've died right
there and I stuttered out a fast explanation, ended with, "Is this a good time
to mention I'm LFG?"

I didn't get a group. :)
