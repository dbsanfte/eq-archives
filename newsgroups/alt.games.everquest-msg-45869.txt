You pick the "what do I do if I go LD" option -before- you go LD, much
like you currently pick whether you want to walk or run, whether you
want to automatically pick up no drop items without a warning box, that
sort of thing.  Best if it was set on a character by character basis, since
what I'd want my rogue to do if LD would be different than what I'd
want my cleric to do...

I suppose you -could- be asking where the infomation would be stored,
and you'd have a point, EQ does store a lot of information on our machines...
but this byte would have to be on theirs.  Thats technical stuff, though, I
was just spinning a "how could you deal with this better without making
LD an attractive option" theory, no practical programming thoughts behind
it at all.
