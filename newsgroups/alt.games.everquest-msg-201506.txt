I've been thinking of starting a new character -- the classic I'm bored with
a necro & want something different -- and could use some advice.

Tracking is one skill that seems awfully useful, but I've never played a
tracker. So ...
   How useful is it?
   Do the ranger's higher skills levels & sort options make it significantly
more useful that of the other tracking classes?

Also, how useful is archery at low levels (under 20 or so)? Is it just a
convenient way to pull or is bow kiting practical at those levels (using a
good bow but the least expensive arrows)?

Finally, how practical is it to solo with a ranger?
