I wouldnt worry to much about that. Ive been playing for a few months
now and my main is up to lvl 42.  I notice that most of the people
dont know how to group properly yet.  Ive done some ldon's lately
where the group can barley handle a MistMoore normal and Ive been in
some where the people are so good we can go to Marr(not sure what its
called but much harder then MM) and handle it with ease.
