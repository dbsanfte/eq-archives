This made me realise how unfun it is to be on the recieving end of a
katamari - EQ1 boats after switching to DX9

Also, I doubt WoW servers use different maps than the client, and even
if they do I don't think they accidentally invert the geometry surface
vectors (!) on the server side causing mobs to wander the "Underfoot",
as it were, and massive ammounts of falling damage out of the blue
while wandering flat terrain.

Not saying WoW doesn't have it's bugs, just saying sometimes quality
does count over quantity. I may change my tune after playing WoW for
more than a few hours, but so far it's been the nicer experience, play
wise.

and never a good measure.
