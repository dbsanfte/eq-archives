Heh. This is a fine line for me.  I gave up my +6 int rings, earrings, my +8
int mask, etc etc etc to my lvl 5 mage... basically around 4k of
merchandise( I had from my now dead wizard of 49).  Imagine a lvl 5 mage
walking around with +230int and +160wiz.... to me, thats twinking. On the
other hand if you supply 10 plat for the frist lvl up spells, just so you
can start to farm for money and so fourth is more or less a kind gesture.
I've had my 49 wizard give 10, 20, or even 50plat to a "genuine" new player.
*shrug* like you said, "To each his own..."
