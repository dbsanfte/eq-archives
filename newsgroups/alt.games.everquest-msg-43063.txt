If these go live the high level melee game just changed drastically.

* Monks and Rangers will get triple attack.
* Rangers will get a defensive increase 50+.
* Monks will be given a new damage bonus at 55 and again at 60.
* Bards will get increased offensive capacity from Level 50+.
* Two-Handed weapon damage will be markedly improved.
* A retro-active change of ultra high end two handed weapons to
improve them is planned.

First off, ranger aggro will be even HARDER to control... I wonder if
that is a triple attack discipline or something that actually goes off
like double attack.

However the rangers also get a defensive increase? If that is a
significant increase, rangers may have just jumped back to
respectability. Or even past respectability. :-)

I didn't know there WAS a monk damage problem. They gotta be getting
close to rogues now with this bonus.

And the bard change will be welcome as well.

This would definately go down as one of the most interesting changes,
if it goes live.
