A group, and not a very well constructed one for that matter, in our 
60s, took him out.  I suspect a 75 necro would have no trouble.  Trick 
is his sister is standing right next to him, both at once is tougher. 
Tough enough that we wiped... she died from DOT when we were all out of 
the zone so no body when we got back!  But then we were able to take him 
out alone, and a couple hours later took her out before he repopped. 
Yeah, our Leet split strat.
