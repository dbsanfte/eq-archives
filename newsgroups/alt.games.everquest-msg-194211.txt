Can a character get skill ups (in 1hs for example) while dueling. I never
duel, but I recently had a diabolical plan to let my 17 ranger beat the crap
out of my veteran druid (little chloroplast would keep his rusty weapon
damage effect off for quite a long while). Would this provide the ranger
with 1hs skill ups?
