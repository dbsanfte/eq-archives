yes.. when you go to the register expansion part.. one of the choices is
Trilogy. If you use the trilogy to upgrade you keep your original
subscription but lose the chance to use the trilogy as a new subscription.
Hope this helps if you have any other concerns or I could be of more help
let me know.
