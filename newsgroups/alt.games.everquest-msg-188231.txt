I don't know about others, but I restrict my looting to items that I know
will sell for a fairly decent amount of plat. I've been thinking of
searching for a WR bag, but I don't played Xiser (my Iksar monk) often
enough for it to be a priority when I do play

They way it works is that over 14lbs you start to lose your monk AC bonus. I
don't believe it is possible to lose anymore than the class bonus, but I
haven't tested it. You periodically get increases to the max, every 15
levels it goes up by a pound.

This is the very reason I am disappointed whenever I play a char other than
my shaman, I'm a SoW addict.
