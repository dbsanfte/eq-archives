It comes up twice, once for the patch program, that is not a problem, then,
if eq has been patched, it comes up again, right after EQ takes over the
video.  That second one is the one that causes me problems.  I know I can
manually set it, but, in order to do that, I first have to download the EQ
patches to update the EQ executable, then go into the ZA control center and
allow the new EQ to access the internet.  I could do that, but it's annoying
to have to remember to do that each time.
