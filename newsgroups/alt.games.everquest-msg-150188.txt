I think one of the biggest problems for grouping is the difficulty of
finding a group to begin with.  I'm surprised that LFG channels haven't
developed.  It would sure be easier to join a LFG channel and see whats
available across many zones instead of the current method of running from
zone to zone, or standing around shouting for an hour.  Would also be a good
way to get together groups for the more remote but "lucrative" locations in
which you need to bring your own group.
