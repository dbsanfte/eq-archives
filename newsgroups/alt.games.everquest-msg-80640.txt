Just a note about how I fixed my crash to desktop...hope this helps someone.

Was crashing to desktop at intermittant intervals...sometimes 30 minutes,
sometimes 30 seconds.  Sent inquiry to tech support, and just got generic
answer saying to upgrade drivers...didn't work.

System:
    AMD Athlon 900 (Win 98 SE)
    384 meg DDRAM
    GeForce 2 64meg Video
    Creative Soundblaster Live
    3Com 56k Modem (yeah, I know...but DSL or Cable Modem not available yet
in my area)

Added the "USE UMBRA=FALSE" to "DEFALUT" portion of the eqclient.ini (this
helped, but didn't fix)
Disabled the "Live Drive" portion of the SB Live card.

It appears that the Live Drive was causing conflict.  Disabled it, and no
more crashes.  I have turned all my Luclin models back on, and can finally
play again without interrupt.

I have not seen this addressed before in any of the Tech Forums, and just
wanted to put this out there.  Hope this helps some of you other frustrated
people.
