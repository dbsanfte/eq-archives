Can anyone help me
> find this guy?

His name is Gram Dunnar, or something like that. If you're standing next to
PoT stone, facing AWAY from it, he's in the house to your left. Enter the
house through the door close to the Soulbinder, and he sits on the floor in
the first room on your right coming in.
Get that? :)
