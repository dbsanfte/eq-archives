I notice a lot of people saying they're just fine, same as before,
etc. and I'm beginning to wonder if I'm the only one experiencing
this.

I can certainly still play, but the game is no longer quite as fluid
as it once was.  It's most noticeable turning; where once I could zip
along the platforms of Kelethin SoW'd with nary a problem, now I have
to be just a bit more careful, since I simply can't turn as quickly as
I once did.

Obviously not a show-stopper or anything, but if I'm alone in seeing
this, I'll look into getting different drivers or something.

I have: P3 866, 512 mb RAM, GeForce 3.
