Most important thing is players who know what they are doing.  Personally
with my Shaman, I love grouping with a few other guild members,
specifically, a lvl 20 bard who is awesome (keeps three songs going
constantly through the battle, mana and regen during downtime), a lvl 21
enchanter, and some tank or other or two.  Heck even while the bard was AFK,
he left mana song going, and we did great, very little downtime.  The most
fun I've had was with my shaman, another shaman, the enchanter, the bard, a
monk, and a warrior, all lvl 20 to 26.
