Some believe that a Ranger with Archery Master 3 and Endless Quiver
can outdamage most other classes, using the bow.  Higher level rangers
can fire off in very rapid succession and do an average of 200 per
shot.  Criticals of over 1000 are not unheard of.

This is what I can tell you from personal experience (54 ranger):

-At level 54 with skill maxed, my archery buff cast, dexterity at
around 150,
a fairly good bow, and summoned 3-damage arrows, I do not come close
to outdamaging melee.  But I could most certainly kill anything I can
root in a fairly reasonable amount of time.

-Yes rangers, and only rangers, have an item that will summon arrows. 
The only one I know of is called Tolan's Darkwood Bracer.  It is very
rare and very expensive.  (10k or so on MT)  It drops in Sebilis. 
There are other Tolan's items out there, such as a helmet that casts
greater camoflage, arms that cast stinging swarm, etc,...  They all
require level 45 for right-click spells to work though.

Works like this: place any arrow in your ammo slot, and you have an
endless supply of that arrow.  So you can get the highest damage arrow
you can find (which for woodelves will be 11 +4 IIRC and for others,
10 +4) place it in the ammo slot, and you are good to go.  An
additional benefit is that you can sell or toss out your quiver, as EQ
has a built-in haste as well.

BTW I highly recommend that anyone who plans on getting fletching up
does it with a Wood Elf.  You can make arrows out of store-bought
components up to level 202.  At that point you have 3 choices:

-Make bows (very expensive)
-Make acrylia shafted arrows (10 +4 magic/cold/fire/shadow damage; not
as bad but still very expensive, and requires smithing)
-Make mithril champion's arrows (10 +5 damage, Tunare-only; the
cheapest option)

The real important thing is that only Wood Elves can utilize the third
option.  As a side note, I don't know how badly other classes get
screwed for not choosing the right deity and the right class, but
Rangers get royally screwed for not choosing Tunare.  And if they want
to fletch, they get screwed again if they do not choose the wood elf
race.

Tunare worshipers get some really great gear, such as one of the best
bows in the game (Blessed Faydark), the Helm of the Tracker, etc,... 
I have, to date, seen one Karana-only item, a sword, and it is
complete garbage.  Tunare worshippers also get some really nice
player-made armor.  (Tunarean Scout Armor).  Karana? Zilch.  (I know
this very well because I made the horrible decision to worship
Karana.)

My suggestion if you plan on making a ranger, is that you choose a
Tunarean woodelf and save yourself a lot of trouble.  Stats arent that
important as gear can solve stats problems.  But nothing that I know
of can cure a religion problem.
