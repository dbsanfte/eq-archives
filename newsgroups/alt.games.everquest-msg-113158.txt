Thats a different situation all together. Aggemammon was only "pestering"
druid who
didnt seem to be doing anything but possibly /gu and /tell and/or whatnot
tradeskills.

Sure if someone disturbs you while you are obiously engaged in something
else, they
are twats (or extreme newbies, which in itself is no crime!). Its the "I am
to uber to even
answer your query" type of attitude i think is more common in druids than
other enabling
classes. But as "Fokari" said, I might just be imagining it, im a n00b of a
mere 200 dings
and >1 years of playing so what do I know.
