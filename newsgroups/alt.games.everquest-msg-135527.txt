If SOE wants to go bragging about a 100K plus population number just
now, that's pretty pathetic. If they hit it, it's going to be composed
of a *major* percentage of "players" who are asleep, at work, getting
laid, etc. while their mules sell stuff, or the alts of people who are
playing their main at the moment. Either way, it's a grossly inflated
number.
