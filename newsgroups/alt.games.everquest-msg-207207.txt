The bard epic, IMHO, remains the single most beneficial *individual* epic in
the game. The diff between an epic bard and a non-epic bard is pretty
significant. Yes, there are better "weapons", which is why you'll see a lot
of higher end bards with the epic moved to their off hand, but rare is the
epic bard that you see actually bag the epic -it just adds way too much
flexibility for you to put it away.

The Cleric epic is, IMHO, the single most beneficial *guild* epic in the
game. A guild with a epic cleric inevitably does way better raiding than a
guild without. Manaless rezzes just make such a huge diff on CR's.

After that, they vary. The SK one seems very nice, but is buggy as anything.
The Warrior epic is oft maligned, but, man, that 500 Hate proc seems nice
when it's aggro that you want. That manaless dot on the shammy epic is kind
of nice. The rogue and BL epics have some nice haste/effects. The chanter
epic is mighty big on raids too (There are better hastes, but manaless haste
is pretty nice). And so on, and so on....
