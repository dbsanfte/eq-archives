I beta'd Horizons, then did a trial a few months back to see how it
was progressing. It's, honestly, tragic. A game with so much potential
to be great that just tripped out the gates. It was rushed out way too
early, didn't have even half the promised content (These two, I have
to wonder if they were more Atari's fault or Artifact's....), and AE
was too fixated on focusing on the crafter side while neglecting the
adventurers.

It could have been so great. Characters looked great, dragons are a
blast, crafting is absolutely wonderful....but everywhere else, it
falls short of promises. I so wanted to see it do well when I was beta
testing... :(
