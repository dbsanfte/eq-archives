There should be a list for people like you.  Seriously, putting someone on a
"no sow, buff or heal list" is retarded just b/c they inspected you (unless
of course they inspect you repeatedly to be annoying as i have stated many
times in the past).  We can only hope that someday it all comes back to you
when you need assistance in some form.
