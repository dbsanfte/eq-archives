Stuns cannot stun yellow and red targets at the high end, as
well as at severl points along the way there.  My Paladin will
ding 61 shortly, at which point he will be unable to stun
yellow and red mobs until he hits 62.  At 63 red mobs will
be unstunnable, etc.  It is true that the Divine Stun AA gives
a stun that works on higher level mobs (up to 68), but it is
a low aggro stun (the only one in the game, as far as I know)
and its duration is shorter than its casting time (1.0s vs.
1.5s) so it's really a special case and often used differently
than stun spells (it is a zero damage push stun for one thing,
which makes it uniquely suitable for moving mezd mobs).

Yes, you're what, the third person to point that out?  I was
not speaking of losing aggro per se, but rather of having
somebody with lower situational mods (i.e. somebody standing
further away) getting ahead of you on the hate list without
actually drawing aggro.  I did experiment with this a while
back, 2 boxing a Warrior and a Shaman, to confirm that a
successful taunt can make a real difference to holding aggro,
IF somebody has passed you on the hate list without drawing
aggro.  Unless HoTT is going to show me the mob hates the
Shaman even as he beats on me it is NOT helpful in this case,
though I will not be stupid enough to argue its obvious value
otherwise.
