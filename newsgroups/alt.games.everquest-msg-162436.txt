My Ogre Beastlord has just reached lvl 9. I've got all the spells I need
except the most important one, Summon Warder. None of the ogres near the
Beastlord trainer nor those near the Shaman trainers in the Komarr's
Caves sell it. I've checked Allakhazam, Casters Realm and Everlore and
none of them say where it can be bought. So where can I get it?
Thank you for your time.

Cheers Watchman :)
