So you think it should be free then? Heh.

Sane people pay because they WANT to.  Crying about realities of life is
sad.

Khosh.....30 x 8 ? $30 seems steep, even in the uk, expansions are less than
that.  And there are not 8 expansions a year...and I have yet to wake up
finding an SoE employee holding a gun to my head stating 'BUY TEH NEW EXP OR
YOU WILL SURELY BY KILLED UNTIL YOU DIE FROM IT!!!!!11'

Would be nice if things were free, cheaper, whatever.  Free and cheap things
tend to suck ass though.
