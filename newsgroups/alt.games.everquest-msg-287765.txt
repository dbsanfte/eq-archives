Yes, the 'relive the history of Moria' quest is a bit annoying in that 
aspect.  On the other hand, it's cool to run away from a Balrog.  I also 
have an issue with the Moria access quest area in general, which you 
can't get back into once you've reached a certain point.  We had no clue 
this would happen so it was annoying to find it out by accident.  We 
completed those quests on our main characters, but were then unable to 
go back and help friends get through the same quests.

I understand the reason, because the quests change the state of the 
world (I won't spoil it for people who've not done it), and rather than 
having you wonder 'how is this character doing this a second time' they 
just prevent you going back.  I wonder though whether that's in the best 
interest of the game long-term, and it certainly isn't the case with 
previous quests which appear to be time related, for example, I'm free 
to defend Trestlebridge from the same set of orcs over and over again or 
free the same dwarf from the same cage every time he gets kidnapped.

I don't find much grindy in LOTRO I have to say.  Some quests in some 
locations are certainly mob-kill heavy (for example, just getting to the 
quest guys in Goblin Town can be tough work), but in general it's pick 
up and drop pretty easy.  Reputation building and Tradeskilling are two 
obvious grind areas, and I do them as and when I feel like I want to 
invest the time, but you can avoid them entirely and still enjoy LOTRO, 
as I'm sure you're aware.

Overall, I find LOTRO demands less from me, but accepts it when I offer it.

Wrote a short review of Moria when I first played it here,

and I'm in the middle of writing up more about Moria now I've quested a 
lore more.
