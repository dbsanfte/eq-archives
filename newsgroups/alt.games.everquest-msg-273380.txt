One thing quitting did do was remind me that while they were my
friends, they were my game friends, and that was pretty much all we
shared. So the number of EQ friends I am still in touch with can be
counted on a somewhat mauled hand :)

I've been playing AO this past week. It's neat. But, in the interest
of school, I'm not leaving the AO newbie island till after my exams.
So I won't be running into much people there either.
