Do you know the great thing about this time of year? TWO holiday's
rednecks hate:

 1.    MLK, JR's. Birthday. The realization is driven home again and
again that the bigot redneck way of life is being eliminated through
intelligent thought, interracial marriage and common sense� a great
relief for the world as a whole.

2.    The 29th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade.  Once again the redneck
must face the fact that women's right to abortion legally thwart his
natural reproductive process (namely incest, pedophilia and rape).

Unfortunately, the common redneck then resorts to the only outlets at
his disposal: wife/child abuse, pig molesting, and injecting
derogatory/moronic posts in his local community and available
newsgroups.

      Sad and pathetic, but typical�
