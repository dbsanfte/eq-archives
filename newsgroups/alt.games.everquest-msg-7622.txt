    That didn't look like an original statement, or even the entire point of
your post, but an afterthought. But I'll address it now as though it were
you're whole point.

    Yes... By annahilating a train, I do steal all of the mobs in it that I
do kill so that all of the lower level people cannot get experience from
them.
    They also can't get killed by them.
    For that I am truely sorry.  I really wish that all of the experience
that would have been earned could instead go to the people who have fled the
zone because they don't want to take the exp hit by getting slaughtered by
the train from which I am now saving the few who are brave/foolish enough to
stand and fight. </sarcasm>
    Usually in a train situation, esp in BB, the weak flee or die... or flee
and then die because they just couldn't get out fast enough.  The few who do
stay and fight will kill one or two mobs and then die.  Or, if they can
handle the whole train, then they're not getting exp from the majority of
it.
    By blasting out the heart of a train, I actually make sure that more exp
is awarded to more people (usually), because fewer characters die, and more
can stay and kill one or two MOBs.

    If a player is intentionally pulling trains to the entrance of BB, to
"safely" get one or two big MOBs, then I'm afraid that I don't have a whole
lot of heartache over taking the entire train away from him/her to spare the
other low level characters who are resting or healing at the entrance.

    As for the train not returning home (which it does after everyone flees
or dies) because I've killed it...
    The respawn time in BB for most of the many many many spawns is really
not that long.  And a low level character isn't going to be THAT
inconvenienced by having to wait a minute or two for a respawn on any given
random, exp granting gnoll, as opposed to having to heal, zone back in, or
do a corpse run.

    I don't hang out in BB all day saying "look how uber I am."  I don't
hang out there KSing people.  I'm not there to take anything from anyone.  I
go in occassionally to test out spells and work on theories because it is a
totally safe zone for me with lots of MOBs so that I can blast a few without
worrying about taking exp away from people who would otherwise get it.
    But then, I also remember what used to happen when I did get exp there,
and some knuckle head would pull up a train.  So when I do happen to be
there, and that does happen to happen... I put the brakes on the trains I
see.  Ultimately I am doing a LOT more good than harm.
    I call it "playing guard."

> From the 14th level ranger

    No, not at all.
    I said *I* can't start trains in Black Burrow no matter what I do, be it
an AOE, a Bolt, a DD smite, or punching the Gnoll High Mucky Muck in the
nose.  Because *I* am too high level to be aggroed in Black Burrow.

    Your Wizard is lower level than mine... by at least 10 levels.
    As I said, nine levels ago I was train proof in Black Burrow.  I further
said that 25th level might be able to start a train, but not for too much
longer... and he'd probably have to work on it.
