You contradict yourself so many times in these posts. You say its not
about the cash, but something you can no longer offer your friends or
guildmates? How is PoP preventing you from helping friends? You just
feel like you have nothing to offer your friends that they cant get
from built in portals. If that is the only reason you have friends...
if a port is all you have to offer your friends....

Being a 53 druid myself, I have 2 different kinds of "friends". One
type are the ones who only converse with me when they "need"
something. Do these type of friends sound familiar? The other category
of friends that I have are the ones who just like to spend time with
me - I have friendship to offer them - not just a convienent port when
they need it (altho its thiers for the taking). I too dont take money
for ports, but am not threatened by the existance of other means of
transportation now. Im still a valuable asset to my friends and guild
beyond my spell abilities.

As Ronny said in a previous post - you should be happy for your
friends. Thier lives just got easier, but if they dont talk to you now
because they have other means, then they werent your friends to begin
with.
