So why on earth did you suffer it out? If you can get 10 skillups within 
one stack of material, why comine 8.5 stacks more *AT EACH STAGE*?! To 
save a couple plat?? If you have 230 wis, you can likely afford the 
<50pp it would take to buy enough materials to get you to 54 skill.

Even if it is the pp thats killing you, farm spiders for 5 minutes, 
you'll have more than 50pp worth of silk in no time flat.

What efficiency? All the running you eliminated? The 5 steps accross the 
room? Not even that if its a portable skill like baking, tailering, 
jewelcrafting...??

Bah... the discussion is moot anyway. All the items are *no drop*;  
there won't be any 'dropping them on the ground' anyway.

Out of curiosity, the way you suggest this, it sounds like you actually 
did it like this. Does this mean that they weren't no drop breifly, or 
di you just speculate this would work??

Further, I beleive the reason they require more than 100 sometimes is 
that you have to give them 'all that you have' before they'll assess 
whether or not you need to do more or are ready for the next step of the 
quest. ( I imagine that if you gave them 100 and then destroyed any 
excess that would satisfy them, but I haven't acutally tried that)
