As far as I can see /ooc and shout are there for moron chat and that is why
you can turn them off.
To tell the truth debates in /ooc (even dumbass questions like the one
mentioned) don't bother me so much, ooc is a dull grey colour and easy to
ignore, it's shout I hate being used for this crap, as I leave that the
default red and is not so easy to ignore (I want to know when someone is
about to trigger a quest event or mob so I can't afford to miss appropriate
info like that)

The dumbest /ooc or /shout question has to be "what class is the most fun to
play?"
I mean, WTF? How do we know what you are like (other than short of
imagination and intelligence) or what you like? Sheesh, if you can't decide
on a class and race to play in a computer RPG then you should give it up and
go back to licking windows.
