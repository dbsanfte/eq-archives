There's a swarm of them, starting with enchanter section at
http://eq.crgaming.com/.
The most valuable to me so far were the Xorn's
http://members.tripod.com/xornn/ and Rune's http://www.therunes.net/.
But since you're 25, either do LDON or go to Marus Seru to get yourself to
29 when you get first really cool spells (Aug, Clarity) which will enable
you to be much more valuable to your group-mates. Or if you feel like
solo -- use Beguile-24 and Deeds-24, just remember to keep SoW on (and
donate for it, if you can).

Good luck. You will be starting to enjoy playing enchater very soon (the day
when you're not going to die more then 2 times in hour will come eventually
=)
