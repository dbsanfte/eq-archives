Hehe, couldnt agree more. I ended up going down 1 resolution setting 
last night. Always been running 1280*1024, but in POP i could barely 
move. (1 Ghz comp, Nvidea Gforce2, 512 MB ram).

Oh, and BTW, be VERY sure you got backup of all important info on that 
hard drive, have had VERY bad experiences with IBM drives (the store i 
returned the 2nd one to didnt even bother to test it when i said it were 
dead, and actually reccomended that i got a non-IBM back (were still 
guarantee on, so ended up getting a Seagate back from the busted IBM 
one). And at my workplace (computer fixit guy at a hospital), we usually 
have 2 "loaners" ready if a comp break down. 9 months after buyign 200 
new IMB computers, we ended up having 40 of them in for repairs at the 
same time).
