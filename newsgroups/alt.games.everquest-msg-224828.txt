 I got lucky, I was about lvl 35 when my lvl 50 paladin friend and I decided
to try to take down the DW ourselves. We didn't have much hope of survival,
but hey it would be fun trying! We zoned in, and the gods were smiling on
us! The only other person in the zone was a lvl 60 enchanter. He was just
standing there at the IZ, so we asked him to help us. He came with us, the
DW was already popped for some reason, he was able to single pull it easily,
and he nuked it while the pally hacked it to pieces. :)
 Took about 5 minutes from the time we zoned in... I know my story doesn't
quite live up to yours, but it was still exciting and I couldn't believe the
luck of finding the enchanter there when failure was all we were zoning in
to...

Now I am retiring my lvl 65 shaman... His black fur boots will never click
again...

I gave away some stuff the other night on The Nameless, about 5k plat and
some nice armor and weapons, including my Copper Hammer of Striking to an
unsuspecting young lad... He was quite shocked to hold an item worth 1000
times more than he had ever had in is purse...

Actually giving away the stuff was more fun than I had been having in a
while... :)
