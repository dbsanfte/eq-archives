Didn't you recently describe a similar issue on your server Richard?
Where the "keepers of the rotation" for some kunark boss your guild
wanted to kill wouldn't let your guild alliance into the rotation,
insisting that only single guilds were allowed, no alliances?  I'll
bet the motivation on both sides was identical:  raise the bar to
thin the competition.  James' guildleader probably didn't believe
that the other two guilds were going to be able to take Rallos
without help anytime soon, which would give them more time with the
elemental planes to themselves while still allowing them to insist
that they were being "fair" about it by voluntarily accepting a
rotation.  It's a shame if what James say about PoE is true tho,
that you need at least the tacit cooperation of every player flagged
for the zone to be able to progress, that's a pretty nasty load of
crap for the developers to dump on the players.
