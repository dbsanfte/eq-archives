All true... and the response i have to that is simple, and something 
that I should have said all along... "my friend plays a monk".

:)

The point is I'm not going to dump him for random rogue X, becuase the 
ng consensus is that a rog would be marginally better. My attitude 
towards group composition is get 6 different people together with some 
varied class makeup, and pick a role for each... too many players I 
think play the game by figuring out what the roles are in advance and 
then only group with people who are the archetype of each role. These 
people ruin the game for themselves and others.

Further a class doesn't have to be the 'best at a role' in order to have 
a role.    Paladins aren't the best tanks, nor are they the best at 
holding aggro... do they not have a role? I've always found something 
useful for my Pal's to do...

A monk is solid dps, and can pull. A rogue is better dps but cannot 
pull. Sure if you add a chanter into the mix, a rogue might make a 
better puller than a monk in some situations... but a bard with eye of 
zomm is even better than that.
