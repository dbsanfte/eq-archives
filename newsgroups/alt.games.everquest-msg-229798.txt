Nope, pretty much the same game, next new release won't be out for a 
couple months yet, Gates of Discord.

One notable change, Disciplines are now on several seperate timers, so 
you can use them a bit more often, but their use has been tied to the 
stamina bar, whose name is changed to Endurance, and can't be fixed with 
the old stamina refreshing line of spells (which have simply been 
rendered completely useless by this change, rather than their former 
status as almost completely useless)

You'll have to see someone in POK or EC tunnels to buy tomes for your 
disciplines and then hand them in, a few coppers in most cases.

Pure melee classes also recieved a few extra boosts, but not beastlords 
or other hybrids.

Coming soon is an additional boost to pure melee, some sort of "opening" 
system whereby they can utilize even more special moves, to sort of 
compensate for their lack of spells.  Not yet live.

Other than that, hmm, mages got pet canni killed, but I doubt that will 
matter much to a beastlord unless to influence your choice of partners.

Splendid
