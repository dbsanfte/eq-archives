What made you think they would ever learn?

If they weren't smart enough a couple months ago to realize that they can
make back the difference between a 90% and 96% rez in about half the time it
takes to get a cleric to the scene,  they're unlikely to get a flash of
revelation now, or anytime in the foreseeable future.   And thats assuming
the cleric is ready, willing and waiting to come.   If you have to find one,
the amount of extra experience lost is more like one tenth the amount of
time it takes to get a cleric rez.



The most amusing one for me was a person who spent over an hour in a town
zone (I forget if it was PoK or Shadowhaven.  Might have been before PoP)
begging for someone to run out to the ass end of the world and 96% rez him.

Finally I did a /who all idiot.

Idiot - Level 60 paladin. <Guild of Idiots>


Less amusing was the level 61 cleric who refused a 90% paladin rez deep
inside Plane of Innovation.   There was no evacer, so they had to try to
fight all the way back to the zone line with the paladin as the only healer.
Predictably, the entire group wiped, and each of them ended up taking a
death.
