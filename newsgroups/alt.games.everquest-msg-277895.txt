The chars from the newly merged server are the only ones 
moved to your choice of new servers. In my case, I moved 
some chars from Drinal to Stromm. Only Drinal chars were 
moved and I had enough open slots on Stromm to accommodate 
all of them. I was lucky and only one of my chars received 
an x. I have tried to email that other char, but keep 
getting an error regarding that mailbox on Stromm not being 
accessible. That indicates to me that there is no char with 
the name, but GM says the name is not available, so I have 
the option of submitting 5 new names via petition. I may 
keep the old name as I like it, even with an x.
