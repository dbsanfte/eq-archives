Sneak and Hide are set at skill 50 from start for Halfling Druids and does
not improve from there.
Only classes that can improve those skills are Rogue and Monk (Only sneak).

And actually you can still gain skill in Forage while sitting or meditating,
though you will not get any items that way,
in case you are in need of food, water or whatever.
