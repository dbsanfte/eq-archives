Maybe, but it means that you have to switch hotkeys all the time to suit the
MAs name. Live with it?  What if the MA changes during battle.  For example,
a lot of groups have everybody assist the puller, but on mezzed mobs there
is a different assist.  And every group member should know how to use the
'F' keys to target group members anyway.

So what if the MA changes targets?  It isn't any of your business to change
unless they tell you to.  Every MA should have an assist call on top of
their normal incoming call for such cases.  Having a general assist key is
also good for when you want to target the person the mob is beating on.

If you are in a raid of more than one group then yes make a personalised
assist key ON TOP of the general one.  But I would encourage people to not
make personalised assist keys all the time, it can be safer in some respects
but get into agro problems and you are in a mess (MA dies?, mezzes are
breaking?).  Having it general means you are more flexible.  Sure there are
going to be times you stuff up but if you learn using it to start with you
will soon learn to get it down pat.

I am against groups just falling into automated functions if you can't tell
:-).
