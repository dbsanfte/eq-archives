There's rarely any reason to use AE mez with only 2-3 critters...it doesn't
last nearly as long as single-target anyway.  My 58 enchanter doesn't even
mem it unless I think there's a decent chance of 5+.

Yup, work on getting your MR higher.

But if you're mezzed, you're still able to sit down.  That might piss off a
non-mezzed critter enough to come over & thwap you to break it, but if not,
that's 24-36 seconds of med time you can get in. :)
