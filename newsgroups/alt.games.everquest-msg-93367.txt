LOL... I LOVE IT and all the suggestions you came up with too!!
I am bigtime practical joker both in RL and in game when I can get
away with it ;=)

Plus, I have a little halfing rogue (he's rouge. ;-) ) and he
Bristlebane follower and he would LOVE something like that too!

IMHO..... I think EQ NEEDS something like this to break up the
seriousness and sometimes rut we can get into sometimes!!

If VI would ever put something like this in game (which I seriously
doubt they will) the would make the armor rediculiously high level
and/or extremely diffucult to get. Some epic like quest. 
That I could understand tho,... you don't want every Tom, Dick and
Harry rogue running around with this kind of stuff.  The novelity
would wear off REAL FAST

I can just imagine some of the senarios.. especially ability to change
other mobs, imagine a group fighting a wurm in GD and you sneak along
change the wurm into a bunny...  they would going "WTF !!??"

But one other suggestion... you should be able to use the effect on
the armor while you rogue invis and it doesn't break hide/sneak!, or
just regular invis if your not a rogue!!
Also effect doesn't have ANY spell effect graphics!!

But IDEALLY this armor should be rogue only.. IMHO
Haflings are practical jokers by nature (or by Bristlebane ;-)

but rogues are the kings of practical jokers!!

I have a level 10 halfling rogue that would to play with stuff like
that.. muhahaha
