I'd be surprised to say the least.  Have you done comparisons with the 
same buffs on both characters casting on the same mobs?  Are both 
characters the same level, with the same focus and/or AA abilities that 
may affect this?  Both the enchanter and shaman spells have a zero 
modifier to resists, and are checked vs magic resist.  As the enchanter, 
do you normally tash first, then slow?  As the shaman, do you normally 
malo(whichever) first, then slow?  Against mobs without special resists, 
I have little trouble landing a slow, some I know are tougher, so I 
debuff first.  Some I know will make paste out of me if it's resisted, so 
I debuff them first too.
