I don't know what a druid at 26 would consider "great Exp"  I'm only
getting to almost 14(druid), but I can't imagine, having run a 20 ranger
in Lake Rathe, that a 26 druid would be getting any xp from the single
spawn.  It would have to be greening out around 26.  There were
occasional greens at 22.  Oh, and the AE druid lull is called Harmony. 
Can't be resisted, doesn't agro.  I started soloing the(then
white/yellow) orc camp in the corner of misty at 10 using harm/porcupine
tactics.  

I'm getting Crazy exp right now doing chasm crawlers/lions/spiders in
EK.  If I could just not bite off more than I can chew, I'd be 14 by
now.
