I can't answer any of your Shadow Knight related questions, as I've
never played one. However, if your first goal (like mine was) is to
simply learn the mechanics of the game, then you would do well to look
at starting a Dwarven warrior.

Once you've gotten the hang of the mechanics, you can fire up a shadow
knight, and any other class that you may be interested in as well.

>Will I be able to play solo with a shadowknight

You'll be able to solo just about any class for the first ten or so
levels. After that, you'll almost certainly have met some friends, or
have gotten comfortable with joining up with strangers.

I seriously doubt it's too much. The rules there are different, and
more restrictive in some ways, but they're not intrinsically harder.

>if you have any wisdom to pass on, I am all ears!

The most important thing is to never, ever, beg for money or items,
either in private tells or in public channels. There is no surer way
to make people dislike you.

A positive thing you might want to try is to announce in the /ooc
channel that you're a true newbie (as opposed to a new character
started by an experienced player) and would like to learn the ropes
from someone more knowledgeable. I know that if I was just hanging
around (which is what I'm usually doing) instead of actively working
on some task, a well worded and polite request like that would
probably get my attention, and my assistance.

Again, welcome. And don't let us jerks in this newsgroup scare you
away - we're not all that bad :)
