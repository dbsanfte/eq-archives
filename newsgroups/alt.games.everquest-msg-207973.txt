Today's issue of the Christian Science Monitor has an article called
"Fellowship of the online gamers", which is largely about Everquest
but mentions other MMORPGs, about how many EQ players are drawn toward
the sense of community when playing EQ (as opposed to being attracted
towards violence which some computer games have).  Several players
were interviewed, and the article also refers to a study by Nicholas
Yee titled "Befriending Ogres and Wood-Elves: Understanding
Relationship Formation in MMORPGs".  There's even a short glossary at
the end for certain EQ phrases.  The complete article is available at:
