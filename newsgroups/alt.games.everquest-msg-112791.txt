Yoro~

Max, you are a self proclaimed non-player, so you really have no clue what
you are talking about.  You are guessing and guesswork isn't going to give
you a real view of this game.  If you do not like games, get the hell off
this newsgroup and find something else to do with yourself, whatever that
may be.  I can think of a few options which involve some dismemberment you
can perform on yourself, send a message if you'd like instructions.

Your posts smack of jealousy that you are not able to play something other
people are enjoying all over the world.  If I didn't know better, I'd
believe you really want to play and are afraid to...OR you have played and
your account was banned for your mouth, which in all honestly, would not
surprise me from the garbage I see you spewing here.  In fact, the more I
re-read the posts you've put up, the more I believe that is probably the
case.

Most of the insults you are making have no base or place in any thread.
Until you have actual proof, I would highly suggest you keep those remarks
to a minimum.  It isn't becoming to you to show what a homophobe you
are...which is exactly what I see you doing.  Why do you care if someone
else is lazy?  Fat?  Gay?  Straight?  What does it do to you in the end?
Nadda.  I could care less as long as the person on the other side of the
screen can play their class well and is able to pull their own weight.  What
do you do in your spare time Max?  Hmm?  If this is your sole source of
'fun', you really need to find something else to do.

I see your address is 'plasticplayer'...is that a blow up plastic or hard
plastic Max?   I think  you better take a long hard look in the mirror there
bud - you have some serious issues you need to work through before you
'contribute' much more here.  I think if I were you (and boy I'm glad I'm
not) I would be working on getting a much different address set up for
myself to use when espousing the junk you do in your posts.  You sure look
the part, do you dance the dance too?

Use capitalization and punctuation liberally please, it will assure you look
a little more intelligent than a fence post next time you write.

And just so you have a tiny bit more information to hopefully help you pull
head out of ass soon, the player base is not all male, in fact, it has quite
a large female population - so your crass remarks make you look even more
the dipshit than you've already accomplished in this thread since you
obviously overlooked that tidbit of info.

People come from all walks of life here, young, old, rich, poor, skinny,
fat, beautiful, ugly,  and everything in between.  Of course, trash is not
welcome.  Please take your leave as we do not welcome your kind.

kk thx la~
