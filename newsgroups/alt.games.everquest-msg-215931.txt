This is totally unrelated, but after zoning into Halas today, I ran over
the raft to swim, but found myself going the reverse direction back into
the tunnel to Everfrost.

Several times in the past week, spells have "changed" on me, as in I'm

I was questioning my sanity, but now am wondering if a bug is indeed
roaming around within the spell casting code....
