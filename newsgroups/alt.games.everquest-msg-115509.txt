No he won't.  I have first hand experience of this.  My druid is ally
to dragons and I have dragged corpses away from the dragon circle many
times.  She did not agro.  Ever.

>Velious agro rules - you drag a kos corpse, you become kos.

Not all of velious.  My druid is also the designated corpse dragger
for my guild's obligitory first attempt whipe on Sontalak.  I can pull
corpses out from under his feet all day long and he keeps on regarding
me as his ally. 

Then my guild rezzes and whomps him on the 2nd try.
