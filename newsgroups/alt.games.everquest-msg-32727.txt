you shouldn't be going anywhere besides the hunting grounds where you can
find 1st and 2nd level critters at first.  Grouping at 1st thru 4th isn't
that good an idea, unless your a mage who needs the help and wanna join with
a tank.  If the tank wants to share exp, works out real good for the spell
caster.

You should be conning stuff right off the bat, by targetting it (F8), and
pressing C, to con it.  if its yellow or red, don't bother, unless you want
to die real fast.  a group of newbies I guess could take yellows a reds, if
they knew what they were doing.

you should be equipping your weapon before you fight stuff, and scribing /
memorizing spells if you have any.  you start with 2 if your a spell caster.

Dying has no penalties up to 6th level, besides losing whatever you were
carrying, and body rotting in 1 hour roughly.  You start to lose exp when
dying at 6th on.  Clerics can rezz at 39th plus that give back exp lost.
