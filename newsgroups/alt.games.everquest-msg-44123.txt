My guess is that they were making it up.  I never had that problem while on
dialup with MSN.  My service is better with cable and, now, dsl, to be sure.
But I was never booted by MSN for being idle (even while sitting on the char
select screen for 3 plus hours, once).

It's easy to blame MS for your problems.  They're big and seem to have a new
improved non-stick coating.
