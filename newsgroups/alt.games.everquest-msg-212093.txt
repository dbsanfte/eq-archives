Harmony cannot be resisted as it coded as a beneficial spell however
they level capped it some time back and added Harmony of Nature to
the game for mobs over level 39 (or whatever the level cap is, I
don't recall exactly.)

HoN unlike the original spell is single target and has a higher
recast time however on the plus side it works on any mob not flagged
as immune but is coded as some sort of weird detrimental/beneficial
hybrid which means it CAN be resisted but often won't cause aggro
when it happens.
