*shrug*
I haven't played a Necro, but playing a Druid groups work out great
for me.  It's true that the first time or two I group with people I
don't know things are often a bit rocky, but it's worth the trouble.

That's a fair bitch.  Have you given SOE feedback worded like that?
They do seem to pay attention to feedback they get in Developer's
Corner on eqlive.  Maybe a handful of non-instance entry restricted
dungeons that disallowed grouping could be created (sort of a soloers
paradise, with only ## players allowed in at a time and a time limit
of ## hours per account per week).

Well, as they have not yet demonstrated the ability to create content
aimed at single groups that is completely insoloable, I'm not at all
sure that your concern is well founded.  OTOH, if they do make LDoN
truly non-solo content, then I expect we'll be hearing some serious
howling if they also continue their extremely annoying habit of tying
new game features to the purchase of each new expansion.
