That's something you have stated before, and I still don't understand. 
Did SOE ever call what they did a nerf, in any way shape or form? As far 
as I can recall, the only people calling it a nerf are those for whom it 
has turned out to be one, those of us who used to solo in PoP. Generally 
SOE are loath to call anything they do a nerf, even when it is, let 
alone when it has mitigating circumstances, like in this case.
