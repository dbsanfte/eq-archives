Eh, I dunno about snared.  It generally seems to take my pet more like 3-4 
seconds to cover any reasonable distance I may have placed it away.  But 
one second should be plenty, if, of course, I'm paying attention.  And of 
course my pet is never expedienced. :)

True.  But assuming they're paying attention to the parts that really 
matter isn't as unreasonable.  If we know that it matters, and why it 
matters, we'll pay more attention to it than if you just lay down some 
unreasonable-seeming rule about it.

Yea... I can think of a few places where that might apply... on the way to 
Fennin, for example.  But if the monks need more room to split, surely 
they could pull a bit further ahead before telling us to move up, or 
position the raid a bit further away, rather than chucking a potentially 
sizeable fraction of the raid's DPS?
