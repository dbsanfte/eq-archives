B) you snipped out the part where I said

"Of course todays' patch includes the line
- Fixed a bug that would allow PC's to be attacked by PC
controlled pets (in non-PvP
situations).
so perhaps its been fixed just as I noticed it."

which pretty much obviates your post.

Also, note I said "perhaps" its been fixed.  Unless you've been on
since the patch (which as far as I know isn't complete yet) you don't
know whether it's been fixed or if they are even aware of this problem.

There was another problem where pets were attacking players when their
masters went LD, its possible that that problem is what was addressed,
and not this one at all.

Its also possible that whatever they are trying to do will end up not
working.

So my point is... you could be right, but you could be wrong, and if
you are right, well I already covered that in my post, you just didn't
read it carefully.

Probably wouldn't be so bearish about this if you hadn't top posted
though.
