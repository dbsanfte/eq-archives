Welcome to the Front Lines!
Specifics on playing a Shadow Knight I cannot give, and I know there are
some things we both do the other cannot.  But I am a bit of a zealot on
weapons training.  Just got my Hand-to-Hand maxxed at 100 last night =).
Faster weapons may often hit for less, but you get more swings on target and
that will increase your chances of improving the skill. When a weapon that
is great for your level falls to you, it's nice knowing you'll be able to
wield it competently.  Many weapons also have an AC bonus - Deathwatch Sword
is 16dmg/34dly with 10 AC. Practice Everything!  Bind wounds to half before
healers start all that finger-wiggling.  Make a Hot-Key that runs through 5
pulses of Sense Heading and punch it  whenever you can.

I want H2H weapons too!  It's not fair!  </whine>
