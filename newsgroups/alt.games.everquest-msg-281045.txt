Of course, all of these are changed in today's game.  The biggest change,
though, is player expectations.  This is something that can never be regained
in EQ1, or in new games.

Umm, bad xp, bad loot, and boring grind IS the punishment most people cite for
soloing.  I miss old-time EQ grouping requirement, though I hated it when it
was in place.  It is an example of what I wanted (easy soloing when I felt
like it) not matching what was the most fun (making friends, overcoming
challenges).

No additional loss per se, but since some levels were different sizes, it
could look that way.  The death penalty is another area where I really hated
it at the time, but look back on it as one reason for some of my fondest
memories.  Having to actually get back to your corpse was an INCREDIBLE
challenge sometimes.  Would I do it voluntarily today?  Nope.

Neither.  Customers now have more choice in what they play, and we will never
again see the mix of casual players and hardcore environment that we had in
EQ1.  I strongly prefer playing with people who don't live and breathe the
game, scour messageboards for hints, etc., but do take it seriously enough to
have fun overcoming difficult challenges.  I don't think there are enough of
those people to make a game successful, now that there are alternatives.
