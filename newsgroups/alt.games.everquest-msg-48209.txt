*Sigh*

First case of inhaled Anthrax in 25 years, followed by a second confirmed
exposure, then also a source (keyboard of a computer) identified. BTW,
Anthrax doesn't naturally occur in Florida according to sources...

My issue:

The government has beat it's chest for a week about how quick and prepared
they were to respond to issues and problems arising from chemical or
biological threats.

If that is the case, why the god damn hell are people lining up again the
next day for screening by a few people to make sure they aren't infected
when time is of the essence?

Simple answer, they don't give a shit about saving people other than those
already on site trying to do their job. They haven't taken this serious
enough and simply demonstrated to the American people and terrorists that
they would respond quickly and with capable resources.

Sure it's a couple of cases, but 500ish other people are possibly infected
and the staff stayed open late screening people and then told the rest to
come back tomorrow. What a sad sad sad response. There should have been an
immediate dispatch of CDC personnel and a full staff ready to quickly screen
these people in hours. How hard is it to have a few more screening stations
open up and handle this appropriately?

What the hell are they going to do when there are 500,000 hit?

This was the perfect opportunity to show and console Americans that
emergency response is ready and waiting, and they failed miserably.
