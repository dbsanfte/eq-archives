Wow wasn't intending to start a PL vs non-PL arguement ... was just
curious.

Must admit I'm pretty neutral towards PLing (unless they grab prime
spots for too long).  None of my characters have been PL'd as I'd
rather get there on my own steam and enjoy the journey.  Don't think
I'd appreciate a PL'd character any more than I would an ebay one ...
but I can understand why people do it (particularly those in high
level raiding guilds).
