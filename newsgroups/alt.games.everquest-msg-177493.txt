 Of course it's not EQ PS2,I was only saying that it would have been
better to have a system of ports that were only available to you once
you got to a city on foot first. That way a level 1 -10 would have to
level up a bit  before running all over Norath without fear of getting
there in one piece.

 Yeah, and your point is?....Even with EQatlas maps you still have to
get there on foot, you still have to worry about running to close to
some creatures aggro area and you still have to be careful about
what's near the road. Remember that feeling of relief when you finally
got to the gates of the city you were trying to get to for the first
time.

Wrong . You may not "need" to buy it to play, but you sure as shit
have to buy them to get all the spells, items,weapons,and characters
that are in the game. So , SOE may say it's "NOT REQUIRED" to play,
but they know you'll buy it for that extra bullshit that they know you
want and that should have been in the game to start with.
