I would; if you are sitting waiting for mana to get back up, you may as well
use bandages to at least ensure your own health is at  70%. You'll find that
the time for mana to regen for a heal is a lot less than using bandages for
the same amount, but it leaves you with more mana for the 70%+ healing.

I wonder if you can sit *next* to a player and bandage *them*? - going to
have to try that one. Can see bandage parties going on in ldons after nasty
pulls :-)
