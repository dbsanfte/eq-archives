I have tried solo kiting WilloWisps in West Commons with my level 15
Halfling Druid.  And it is a tough fight but he can do it (snare/ignite).
Except more times than not whilst running about, Mr. Wisp gets some help
from 2 or 3 of his friends - I wind up running for the zone.  No xp, no
lightstone.

Two questions that I hope this group can answer for me are.  One, is there
at techniqe I can use to be more effective?  And, two, can someone tell me
where I can earn/find/buy a magical weapon?  I am on Firion Vie so
communications and auctions are difficult.  Seems to me that if I could find
a lone WilloWisp (most start out that way), root him, zap him 3 or 4 times
with ignite and then melee him with a magical weapon, I might have a winner.
Of course when the root doen't work there is always SoW and the zone, lol!
