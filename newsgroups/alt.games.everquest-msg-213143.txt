Especially if they don't kill PHs.  If you're a non-tracker and want
to make sure you get some HGs even when there's an oversupply of
Bards and puppies around just pick a handful of spawns in a small
area to work (not on top of the hill).  Kill every PH as it pops and
you'll be right there ready to kill when an HG pops.  Depending on
your class/level/gear you may not be able to kill every HG that pops
from the spawns you're working, but you will see HGs pop right in
front of you that you can immediately engage (and pull to the side
if/as necessary).  Remember that lizardmen, basilisks, giant skels,
cyclops, and HGs all pop at the same locations on HG hill and in the
area to one side where you see a lot of HGs.
