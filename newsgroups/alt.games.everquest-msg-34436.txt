Years ago when Quake1 was the only online 3D game out there an event
happened that almost got 3D gaming banned from our house, (my wife
now playes EQ religously).

One sunday afternoon my daughter was playing, I was hearing some
strange sounds coming from her direction. As I looked over her 
shoulder, I saw that she had learned a new trick, basically she
would grab the quad, (x4 damage), pull out the axe and run around
chopping people, (usually one quad chop would do most people in).

I chuckled, and she turned, just as my wife walked into the room,
and said, "I like axe-murdering people!"
