Fishbone earring, from Hadden in Qeynos Hills.  He's around a 6 hour
spawn.  The FBE is his rare drop.  I got it the second time I killed
him, but I've known people who've killed him 20 times before getting
theirs.

He's around level 25 and is a warrior and will be no trouble for a 39
warrior.  However, there is an enchanter near him who will kick your
ass.  The Erudite Traveller near him might also join in and help him,
in which case your ass won't last long enough to be kicked. :-)

Here's how you can solo him without getting killed by those
enchanters.  When he spawns, pull him with an arrow, and take off
running for Qeynos.  Zone into Qeynos and then zone back to Qeynos
hills.  Hadden takes a different route back than the enchanters take,
and you can easily fight him alone.

I've watched a 36ish warrior at work do this, and it works pretty
well.
