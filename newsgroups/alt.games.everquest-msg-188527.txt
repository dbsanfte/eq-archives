Hi all,

I am starting a wood elf Ranger on the Tunare server. This is my 
very first ranger and I really enjoys this class !
I began training the 1HSlash skill but finally choosed the 2H Slash 
because of high damage at such a level that now it would be useless 
to try to raise my 1H Slashing again.

BUT... I cannot find any common and valuable 2H Slash weapon for 
his 14th level. He still has his *tarnished two-hand sword*.
I looked for very easily found weapons as "2-Hand sword", "Fine 
Steel 2-Hand sword" and I realized there were very expensive for 
the little delay reduction or damage improvement.

I don't bother using a sword, an axe or something else, I just want 
to avoid any quest, for the simple reason that I play quite rarely 
and cannot give so much time just for a weapon, when I have some 
difficulties now to gather 1 or 2 hour to play once.

Would u have some nice ideas w/o doing a quest and w/o giving all 
my plats for a new weapon not so much better than my tarnished 
actual one ?

Thank you a lot for your advices :-)
