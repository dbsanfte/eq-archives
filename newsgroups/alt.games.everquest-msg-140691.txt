Uhm...why?  For example, there's an item I'd like.  There's one for sale on
my server, for more than I have.  It will probably still be there when I
finish saving up enough to buy it, and then I will buy it.  The seller gains
nothing by lowering the price for a quicker sale, other than some short term
cash.  The item is rare, so once he sells it, he's not going to be able to
just go out and quickly farm another for sale.  He's much better off in the
long run doing just what he's doing: setting a good price, and sitting on it
until someone comes along to pay it.

Sure, if something isn't selling for 1K, *and* there are many other people
selling the same thing for less, and there is basically an endless supply,
so all the lower priced sellers keep restocking as they sell, then you need
to lower your price, but for less common items, it is perfectly sound
economically to set a high price and wait for a buyer who is willing to pay
that much, especially if you don't have so many items to sell that you are
running out of space.
