Who limited this to some kind of DoS attack or trojan implementation?  Check
out what's going on between bizbee and il128(whatever).

True, but then advertising other things such as ISP/RL info really gives
someone *so inclined* much more helpful information that some silly IP
information, wouldn't you agree?

Hmm...perhaps I am confusing StanMann posting/cross-posting Morley's IP info
(which was still hugely messed up and you know it) with the RL info war
going on between bizbee and il128(whatever and still hugely messed up also).

Either way, I'll continue thinking that posting IP info and cross posting
the same is messed up and you and Dan continue thinking it's peachy keen
okity fine.

I guess we'll just have to disagree on it because this whole debate has
become 'increasingly' stale for me on such a lovely afternoon.
