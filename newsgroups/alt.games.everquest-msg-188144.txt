You know, this is probably actually a valid point in some ways.  The heart of EQ
is group (and ultimately multi-group) encounters.  Druids, although easy and
convenient to play in ways, are not such a great way to learn group play.  Nor
are they high on the list of desirable group members.  There are a ton of druids
out there who spend their time playing solo or in small outdoor groups, and can
never make the transition to dungeons and raids.

If you REALLY want to play everquest, play a monk, warrior, rogue, enchanter,
bard, or cleric.  Shaman, mage and beastlord are good compromises between solo
ability and attractiveness to groups.  For example, a druid gets weaker and
weaker as he levels up;  a cleric gets more and more powerful until he hits 60.
