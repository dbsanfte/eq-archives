Yup. I like the colour change too. The ring is also a positive as it is now
easy to differentiate at a glance whether it is the mob I am fighting, my
pet, or myself that is target. I think everyone has gotten a little tired at
times and nuked/dotted/rooted themselves instead of the mob they are
fighting. I think there was room for improvement in the old interface and
they have gone in the right direction.

Anyone who can remember the original EQ interface will realise they have
come a long way and I for one are happy they did not leave well enough
alone.
