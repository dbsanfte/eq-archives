Aye indeed its a wonderful place for hunting with good experience.  Not sure
what class you are but I will assume you are ranger from your email addy.  I
too spent much time there as a Ranger and as long as you keep your eyes out for
the goons....you will be ok.  Tracking is great for that.  And if you hear
someone shout GOON to so and so.....my suggestion is RUN and dont look back. 
Only once did i die at the hand of one of them and thats cause I looked back to
see.  Right at zoneline to FM too.  Oh well...live and learn :)    Loot is
pretty good too.  So yes...have fun there and just be careful where you stray
off to.  Outpost is out of the question so you will have to make the run to FV
or LOIO to sell.

Happy hunting!
