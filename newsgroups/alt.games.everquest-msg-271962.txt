I'm doing the gnoll report which says to find "the hidden entrance"; well i
found the one to blackburrow, ran about every inch of the area with assorted
trains of gnolls, and my journal didn't react. I tried running in straight
lines, zig zagging, zoning in and out of blackburrow, running about the area
in a group so i could move more slowly, nothing, sawm in and out, nothing,
checked every guide i could find, no more that i have already done.

What am i missing? I've been running about this cavern for over an hour and
that was my eq time :P

Oh well, mebbe tonight.
