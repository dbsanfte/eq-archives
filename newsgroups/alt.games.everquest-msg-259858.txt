What Blizzard hasn't learned is that enabled PK'ing is many times more a 
detriment to cooperative group play than the inducement to such that their 
clouded minds envisioned, particularly for HC players.  After 3+ years 
they've been so bullheaded about seeing the reality of it that they've done 
practically nothing to correct their misconception.  The result is that much 
of the time you can count the number of public HC hell games on little more 
than the fingers of one hand.

But enough's been said about this elsewhere.
