You do have a point in a way; both of you are right in saying only
some of the people in a raid actually know what is going on [1]. No
system will be perfect. However, the reward for your "brawn" comes not
because they are more skilled than non-raiders, but because their
penalty for failure is higher - they have 40, 50, 60, even 70 other
people who can die if they make a single mistake.

[1] It's actually three tiers:

1. The leadership, the planners: they know what the raid needs to do
and why it needs to do it including why it will work and why
alternatives won't, allowing them to dynamically react and adapt.
These are generally the best players on any server; players like
Meemers or Monual among others here.
2. The whips: they know what the raid needs to do but not why its
necessary or why it works. These folks will stick to a plan like rigid
boards no matter what the situation may require.
3. The "brawn", to use Faned's term: they don't know what to do until
they are told beyond very simple terms, nor do they know why they do
it after they are told. They won't react to a dynamic situation except
in very simple terms, and will do nothing outside their regular class
role. These are the people who mindlessly blast away at the boss mob
while adds ride roughshod through the raid, who are slow to notice
attack-off calls, who find themselves on rampage and don't know
why....

The ratio varies with the guild. In general the more of the first tier
the better as long as they are on the same page; if they aren't, then
trouble's a-brewin'.
