Im level 60 with 14 levels in AA exp, yep the supposed level that people are
rich and can give huge donations......... yeah right.

I don't even have 1k in the bank, and no, I haven't bought a nice big item
recently.  Hardly any of my gear is bought, its what I have earnt by killing
in that zone day in day out.

My bank balance doesn't change.. it remained at a constant 260pp or so for
at least a month recently.
