Dark Elf Enchanter, actually - but I put most of my starting points
into CHA for 113 or 114 base (can't remember).  Got my INT up into the
lower 200s when I started doing jewelcraft (at level 40 or so).  Don't
remember what my CHA was but my prices were maxed out in Thurg.  Even
maxed out, the prices in the jewel store there are not as good as in
Felwithe, for example - but it can't be beat for convenience; the gem
vendor and the metal vendor are in the same room :)
