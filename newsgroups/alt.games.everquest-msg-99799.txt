Better analogy - the pizza guy says he'll be there in twenty minutes.
He actually arrives in twenty-two. According to this shmuck he should
refuse to take the pizza or the pizza guy should have told him it
wasn't exactly twenty minutes every time.

>Some people (like me) can't find their way around Butcherblock,

Then learn the zone. It is beyond easy. You face the druid ring. Turn
right. Go till the valley ends. Turn left. Go about five feet, you see
the skeleton tower on your right. Go down that valley, at the end you
see the road that leads from Crossroads to DC. The crossroads is to
the left; if you're good you can just follow the road to GFay from
that point, if you're evil you'll have to dodge the houses.

At no time will you face any aggressive monster over L7 unless you
have extremely had luck and a named ogre is on the path - neither of
which is over L14.

I think I could get from druid ring to gfay with the monitor off. But
then I know no zone better than BB.

The only difference from what I said above is you take the road right
instead of left. Goes straight to DC. Sort of straight. No branches
but twists around a lot.
