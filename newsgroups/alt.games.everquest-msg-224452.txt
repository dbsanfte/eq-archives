When I'm in a melee-heavy group, my twist is often Vilia's / Battlecry /
Cantata or a DoT.  Without my Troubadour's Mace, I would be unable to twist
in the Battlecry and it would cost my group 16% haste.  If I had one of
those cool stringed-instrument rings from HoH, my Cantata would be improved,
and I'm hunting for a Battledrummer's to boost the DoT damage and if we need
to run for it Selo's will be improved - I can switch in my Thunderbuns of
Karana after we're on the way.
