I was wondering what would be the best armor for a Paladin, I'm currently
39.
I know there is the armor of ro quest, but some of my gear has better stats.
Mostly I've heard a lot about gear with healing, one that summons food, etc,
but have yet to get the names for any of these.  I basically want to upgrade
my gear, apparently my AC is pittifully low, among other things.

Ok I know everyone will probably say look in the bazaar. Now part two.
Where are some of the places to hunt for plat, or items that sell for a lot.
I know common question. I know highkeep is pretty good now that I can
probably solo some of the rooms. Any tradeskills make pretty good money?

I wouldn't mind questing for the armor just not sure which would be best
that I can wear for my level (not necessarily specific for my class)

Any tips?

Thanks,
