There is no such thing as 'classic eq' as it is on the CD; you must play 
the latest version. EQ is an mmrpg, and like most multiplayer games 
everyone must be running the same version. Since there is no single 
player option, you must update to the latest version.

The EQ Trilogy is a bit dated, and EQ is a always being patched, so you 
are several months behind the current version, so a considerable amount 
has been changed/added/improved and nerfed since that CD was mastered.
