  I don't really think this is a valid comparison.  In EQ, a player's
worth to your guild is directly related to their strength of character. 
People tend to notice greed and dishonesty, and if you allow greedy,
dishonest people in to your guild without check, your guild will form a
negative reputation.

  Fervor?  What's wrong with wanting to keep high standards for your
guild?

  You do realize you have the option of saying "It's none of your
business," or "I'd rather not say."  Or you could decide not to answer
them at all.  If you realize if somebody is asking you if you're a twink
because they have some items they're looking to give away, it is a very
low thing to do to deceive them, knowing you will benefit from the
deception.  She could have easily rejected the items once she realized
why he was asking, or could've come clean, but she didn't... at that
point, she lost any claim to innocence on the basis that she was just
trying to keep her privacy.

  You don't think it's a personality flaw to purposefully deceive and
take advantage of another person's good will?  I guess your definition
of a "personality flaw" is a bit different from mine.

  Add to that another "personality flaw"--dim wits.  She lies to a guy
in a guild, then shortly after joins that guild and essentially reveals
her deception?  Unless he was /anon, that was pretty stupid.

  But hey, what guild can't use another lying, slow-witted level 1 monk?

  Yep, sometimes it's difficult to tell a person's "true colors" before
letting them in the guild.  That's why when somebody DOES slip up and
does something to demonstrate themselves as untrustworthy or stupid, you
take note and weed them out of your guild before they have a chance to
take root.
