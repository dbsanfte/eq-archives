I don't know, but I have two favorite guesses:

1.  Because the boats in general are so weirdly coded and buggy
(e.g., why do people "vanish" if they sit still on the boat for
a while?), that you're lucky they work at all, much less be able
to cast spells on them.

2.  So that some numbnuts doesn't cast a spell on <insert big
mob here> as the boat passes the creature's island, only to
have the creature swim up to the boat, slay the spellcaster,
and then everyone else on board who has nowhere else to
escape to.
