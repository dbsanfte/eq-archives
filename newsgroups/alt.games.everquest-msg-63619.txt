Hmmm...won't there be a 45 minute wait to get to the zone?
And then maybe 45 minutes to get back (for non-gaters
anyways)?  This might cut down on the "lets got to the 
bazaar before we go watch "The Lord of the Rings"" mentality
that will probably be going on.
    And I should imagine that there will be other problems
as well.  I invision it sorta like being ebay, but without
any catagories to help you shop.  Want to buy a FBSS?  Ok,
which of these 80 pcs standing around have one?   
I guess unless you can have your character auto-advertise 
your wares.  But if that happens, then everything will
scroll off the chat screen with impressive speed.  No,
I really think that shopping, while easier than it is now,
will hardly become fustration free.
