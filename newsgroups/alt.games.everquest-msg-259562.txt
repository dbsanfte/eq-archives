/agree; it's always best to take the moment to ask if the
person wants help.  Someone else suggested "/say You ok?",
which seems like a fine, short question.  Though again, if
the person is losing hits while trying to run from a mob,
you might step in.  Even then, I might pause to notice if
the mob is well down on hits also, in which case I might
wait a tick to see if it's dying to a dot.  Because, on
the lowbie's end, I'm far less upset at dying than I am
if I spend most of my hp/mana bars fighting a mob and then
lose the kill to some unsought help.

Side question: If I do more than 50% of the hits, and then
someone comes up and finishes off the mob, can that still
steal the kill?  I know I can lose a kill to an NPC guard
even if I've done almost all the damage.  But suppose a mob
has 300 hits, and I do 200 damage, and then another PC comes
up and finishes it off with a 250 damage spell.  Do I get
the xp because I did 2/3 of the "real" damage, or does the
other PC steal the kill because his attack did more damage
than mine?

(rest omitted)

Good breakdown of ways to help.  I do agree with the later
posts remarking that, once someone asks for help, they should
be happy with whatever they get, and not bitch because you
killed the mob rather than healing them, etc.  But if you're
going to help without "permission", healing is a good choice.
(My monk will occasionally pause to slap a bandage on a lowbie
in a tough fight; the 45 hp of healing is usually welcomed. :-)

Now, there HAVE been occasions when I've gotten healed and not
wanted it.  E.g., because I'm trying to take lots of damage to
check my sitting regen rate, or to practice Bind Wounds, or even
because I'm trying to die for some reason.  But when a passerby
heals me in such a situation, I still thank them for the help,
and then explain what I'm trying to do and ask them to stop.
Sometimes, if they've also thrown some buffs on me, I shrug,
thank them, and go off to do some hunting instead, figuring I
can come back to my experimentation later after the buffs fade.

(Though I do wonder sometimes when people throw Clarity or
Intellectual Superiority on my monk. :-)
