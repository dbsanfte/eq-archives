Sword of the Skyfire has an AoE Proc.  It doesn't proc until the late 40's
or early 50 however.

Arms, Human cultural chain, can get expensive, but has a chain look
Feet, Golden Efreeti Boots, also expensive, but add 9 int/wis, plate look
can't think of any for hands

Efreeti used to be camped 24/7, but lately he's largely uncamped.  You could
get a good group or 2 and farm him to your heart's content, the Boots are
common and not lore.
