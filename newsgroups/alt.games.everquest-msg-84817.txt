    That last line says it all. I've already seen speculation that this
server would be the model when EQ begins to wind down, but people still want
to play. It's sad that we're already planning for the end. The fact that
they're bringing additional revenue streams on also hints at the next
expansion not coming out for a long, long time - which dovetails with their
"we're going to be cleaning up bugs for the next long while" comments in the
interview on Casters Realm.

    Get ur phat lewts first, d00d! I doubt they'll be beta-testing much -
the majority of items in game don't have bugs, although a few are
spectacularly bugged (oops, tried to look at the quest note, crashed the
zone). What I see this as is more of a hand-feeding of lewts to people who
are willing to pay $40 per month. The GM event times will be posted, they
get more GM events = they get handed GM loot. Looking at items like the
Prime Healer's Bulwark, that qeynos shield, and the wizard staff from
Al'Kabor, I can see why this could be tempting to some.

    So who did they hire away from Magelo?

    Given the popularity of Magelo, I can see this being a good service. I
would be willing to pay a small premium on my regular service (one or two
dollars per month) to have this added to regular EQ, and I don't use Magelo
now.

    Or the events that we DO get will be retreads of stuff already run
successfully on a Legends server.

    I think one thing you missed was the guild webpage. Depending on how
versatile what they provide turns out to be, this could also help justify
the cost of switching to the new server (monthly hosting costs vs. more
expensive monthly fees). This WILL also be a new split server, so for power
guilds this would be a good opportunity to leave a crowded server where they
have to share spawns and get their own server. I could see this working out
OK for some people, and I guess so can VI (remember the "would you pay for
premium service" poll a while back?) It just pisses me off that we've been
slogging through bugs and incomplete content while programming and content
development people were diverted to this project.
