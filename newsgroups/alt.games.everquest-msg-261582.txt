Funnily enough, back in '99, the stuff that dropped *was* level 
appropriate, because there weren't thousands of level-capped players 
flooding the market with cheap items and distorting the lower-levels' 
perception of what appropriate gear is. If you looted a fine steel 
weapon, you used it, or you sold it to another player. Hell, my first 
magic weapon was a vendor-sold combine scimitar, and I was over the moon 
with it.

The thing is, there are two possible definitions of crap items: Crap 
against the mobs, and crap compared with what the current generation of 
twinks are wearing. The problem of mob balancing vs. equipment does 
exist at every level, but it's more prevalent at higher levels, where 
you really need to pharm zone X for Y amount of time before you can even 
think of tackling zone Z.

But if you feel that the stuff you can get yourself is crap, do this 
little thought experiment: Think of the kind of item *you* would like to 
get off the mobs *you* fight; now scale that up to what the high-enders 
would be getting off the mobs *they* fight, and now consider whether you 
wouldn't, after all, prefer to buy the stuff they'd sell in the bazaar 
rather than what's dropping for you, no matter how good.

Basically, there's no solution to mudflation within the current 
framework of EQ. The only possible way to slow it down be to make all 
equipment loot NO DROP, all tradeskill loot droppable, and all 
tradeskill-created equipment "attunable", so that it can be sold but not 
passed on. I said "slow down" rather than "solve", because mudflation is 
pretty much built into every RPG, and more so in online ones that depend 
on constantly refreshed content for revenue and player loyalty. New mobs 
and new environments are two of the things that people look for in 
expansions, but I don't think they would sell a lot if they didn't bring 
with them the promise of *better* items.
