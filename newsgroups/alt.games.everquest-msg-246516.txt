The several thousand plat argument means that you can fully equip for 20 
bucks at a plat auction site, or hunting spiderlings. EQ has to combat 
that as a legitimate play style. Long term it damages the game. I agree 
that perhaps forcing you to do ldon dungeon runs isn't entirely fair... 
that the spell could be a no-drop mob drop elsewhere...might be a 
reasonable compromise.

I can see that my spells as weapons arguement has a weakness in that 
spells are unique and not substitutable while weapons mostly are, and in 
light of that ... there should be alternate sources of the spell. You 
have my support on that... but not to the point that i think they should 
not be no drop.

At least 72 points is only 2 missions once you get a bit higher level... 
its not *that* onerous.
