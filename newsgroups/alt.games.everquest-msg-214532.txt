A group I was in last night wiped once, lost members a couple more
times along the way, and still finished with 15 minutes to spare.
Level 55-range group. Big tip: Don't rez until after you either
succeed or the timer runs out. It'll take longer to wait for HP/mana
regen and rez effects to drop than to just run back, loot all but 1
corpse holder, and keep moving.

Also, buff and med BEFORE entering the dungeon. You have half an hour
to get in. The timer for the adventure doesn't start until the first
person enters.

During the beta, we did a couple assassinate missions without a map,
at least 4 wrong turns along the way, and finished with 20 minutes to
spare at the slowest.

This can't be emphasized enough: If you don't have a rogue or the
spells, DON'T TOUCH THE FUCKING CHESTS!!!! The traps seem to have an
insane range, and I've seen two party wipes because of them.

This is hugely helpful, yes, but not vital.

Taking on multiple mobs isn't so much a case of must do to save time,
but mobs spawning too close together to single out. :p

>6. Bring a paladin or Cleric to rez people back when they die.
>Cleric's with a click-stick are awesome for these.

As I said above, hold rezzes until after you're done to save time. Get
in, loot, rebuff, and keep moving. The rez timer won't expire before
the adventure is over.

Err, yeah. As I covered above, you already covered here. ><

Oddly, the (apparently) disease traps I was hit with, I couldn't knock
out with cure disease. Even healing my pet with the pet heal spell
wouldn't knock it out. I suspect it might have actually been a curse.

XP is good, too.

Usually binding at the soulbinder at a wayfarer camp is good for those
that can't bind themselves. With the farstone porting, any wayfarer
camp will do, even.

Overall, it is good. Even one such as myself who generally avoids
grouping has gotten to enjoy grouping in LDoN. ;)
