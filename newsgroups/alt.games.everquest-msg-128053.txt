I'm not sure you can make this duck fly.

His program's a log parser, just like Pasketti's.  It doesn't directly
interact with EQ (or EQ's communications) in any way.  All it does is
read the log file.

Suppose I put together a program that you run on another machine,
reads in the map file and shows you the map on that machine's screen,
then you type in a /loc (again on that machine) and it shows you where
that position is on the map?  You can type in locations as often as
you want, and it'll be updating the displayed point each time.  The
only difference between this and what Tibbett's built is that mine
would get the information as you type it in on the keyboard, and his
gets the information as you log it in to your log file.

(Actually, that'd be a useful addition to his program: it allows you
to type in a /loc and shows you where that is on the map.  {/note
WHEREIS xxxx,yyyy})

Suppose Pasketti's parser was running on another machine, reading your
log file on the first machine, and giving you real-time updates on
your DPS, your hit/miss ratio, and whatever else it does (I don't have
the program)?

In one way I will agree with you; the program does make it much easier
to move around as you can see your motion in semi-real-time on the
map; no more guessing when you're weak on the /loc directions.  This
is a real advantage when you're wandering around Steamfont or Rathe
Mountains for the first time; /loc doesn't really help the first few
times in those zones.
