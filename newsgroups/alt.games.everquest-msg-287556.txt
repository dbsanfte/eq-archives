April 17, 2008


Here's a sneak peek at Thursday's Game Update. Please note that changes 
may or may not be made to these before the servers reopen.



*** Highlights ***

- The 10th Veteran Reward, Summon Resupply Agent, is now available!

- Alternate Advancement experience has been accelerated significantly 
for those with fewer AAs spent and will scale back down to the normal 
rate as more AAs are earned.

- Many keyed zones from the Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious, Shadows 
of Luclin, Planes of Power, Gates of Discord, Omens of War, Depths of 
Darkhollow, and Prophecy of Ro have had their key/flag requirements 
modified. All players that have obtained the key/flag will still be 
allowed entry into the zones, as will players that have met minimum 
level requirements for the zones. The zones and minimum level 
requirements are as follows:

- Required Level 46 -
The Howling Stones
Old Sebilis
Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar

- Required Level 55 -
Sleeper's Tomb
Veeshan's Peak
Vex Thal
Locked areas of the Temple of Ssraeshza

- Required level 57 -
Bastion of Thunder
Halls of Honor
The Temple of Marr
Tower of Solusek Ro
Drunder, The Fortress of Zek

- Required Level 60 -
Plane of Water
Plane of Air
Plane of Fire
Plane of Earth
Ikkinz
Uqua
Yxtta
Kodtaz

- Required Level 62 -
Plane of Time
Inktuta
Qvic

- Required Level 65 -
Txevu
Tacvi

- Required Level 68 -
Anquish

- Required Level 70 -
Dreadspire
Demiplane of Blood

- Required Level 72 -
Theater of Blood
Deathknell

- The Season of the Fabled has come to an end. The Fabled NPCs have 
packed up their camps and are riding off into the sunset for another year.


*** Items ***

- Added new spell drops to Meldrath's Majestic Mansion.
- Increased the drop rate slightly for some spells in Crystallos.
- Added recommended and required levels to some trade skill drops to 
help clarify their use. This does not change their actual use as trade 
skill containers do not pay attention to the recommended and required 
levels of items put in them.
- Added a set of new vendors that sell many of the spell research 
components. The cost of these have been adjusted so that they sell to an 
NPC closer to the price it cost to make them, but merchants will sell 
them at a premium. This means that you can save money while gaining 
skill. Also when you make spell combines you can choose between saving 
money, or saving time. You save money by making the sub-combines 
yourself, you save time by buying them.
- Chromatic focus is now available for slot 12 augments for Cultural armor.
- The engineer steamworks that work within the guardian have developed 
devices that help them move within the beast. Fortunately for 
adventurers they can be a bit absent minded about them and adventurers 
can find them lying about.
- A vial of raging heartblood is not as vile as it was previously.


*** Quests & Events ***

- Rylin Coil will now show and give all three tinkering mastery books 
for the tinkering mastery quest.


*** Spells ***

- The Shadowknight spells Touch of Kildrukaun and Touch of Severan that 
were linked together to share the reuse timer with a previous Game 
Update have been unlinked.
- Secrets of Faydwer's Talisman of the Puma has been renamed to Talisman 
of the Cougar.
- Cast time on Quellious' Word of Tranquility has been reduced from 4 to 
2 seconds.
- The Adrenal Boost focus effect has been changed to Life Line, which is 
a mana cost reduction on Pure Life.
- The Closefisted Claw focus effect has been changed to Ethereal Breath, 
which is a damage increase on Ethereal Conflagration.
- Breastplate worn effects that enhanced one rank of a spell or 
discipline now enhance all three ranks.
- Reuse time reduction bonus on Assassin's Efficacy, Impenetrable Body, 
and Fit of Berserking Rage have been set to 25%.
- The Rage of Tri'Qaras effect triggered from Bulwark of Tri'Qaras is 
now a damage bonus that stacks with other effects.
- The recourse from the Challenge for Honor line will now appear in the 
bard buff box.
- The Vinelash Ensnare effect triggered from Vinelash Cascade will no 
longer overwrite the highest version of Entrap.
- The efficiency of Secrets of Faydwer direct damage spells now scales 
up on higher ranks of the same spell.
- Improved Block and Improved Parry have been merged. Any item that 
previously had Improved Block or Improved Parry will now have Improved 
Parry / Block.


*** NPC ***

- Halima in Crescent Reach can now be found in the find window.
- Henrik O'Danos no longer sells Hypericum twice.
- Ralfin in Bloodmoon keep will now cast his heal spell less frequently.


*** AA ***

- Added Rangers to the Critical Affliction line of AAs.
- Increased the range of the Wrath of the Wild AA line to match other 
Damage Shield spells that Druids have.
- Increased the hitpoints and resists of all "Wards" for all classes to 
make them better able to resist ambient damage.


*** UI ***

- The tracking window can now be sorted alphabetically and 
reverse-alphabetically. Also, there is now a check box to set whether 
you want the tracking window to auto-update every six seconds.
- Our UI xml schema has changed. If you are using a custom UI you may 
need to update this file in your custom UI directory.

- Changed -

SIDL.xml
EQUI_FindLocationWnd
EQUI_TrackingWnd.xml


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Situation where double length timer was given on events has been 
fixed. This occurred specifically to people who dropped out of the 
expedition and hadn't been kicked out of the zone yet.
- Changes have been made to the way the client is notified about other 
entities (players, NPCs, etc.) in the zone.
- Changed NPC summon behavior to summon the player right in front of 
their current heading at 1/2 their melee range. Calculations used to 
determine when the NPC should summon have been made a bit more accurate.
- Iksar and Wood Elves should be able to increase their forage skill 
caps after purchasing the forage AA.
- Corrected a problem with hate generation from skill attack abilities 
such as Hail of Arrows and Decimator's Volley. They were generating 
considerably more hate than they should and have been returned to their 
previous, lower hate generation.
- Zone-wide /who commands now use a similar code path to server wide 
/who all commands. Note that this will impose a similar time limit to 
how often it can be used.
- The bobbing effect of levitation has been removed. A new effect that 
pushes you off the ground about a foot and a half has been introduced.
- Fixed an issue with the "Public if Usable" permission in the guild bank.
- Fixed an issue that could place levitated players below the world when 
entering certain zones.
- Fixed an issue that would cause levitate to fail if a player's mount 
was hit by a spell (usually an aura).
- Stacks of two items in the guild bank can now be split.


*** Previously Updated ***

- Fixed an issue with the reset of the Kildrukaun event in Crystallos.
- Lockout timers linked on many similar long-reuse spells of the same line.
