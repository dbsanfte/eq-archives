I'm looking for a classic training target; something that either doesn't 
hit back at  all, or that hits fairly wimpily; something I can take for 
extended periods of time while using my long neglected 2hb and 2hp skills.

I started in doing this by taking mobs in OT down to the point where 
they run, then switching in my training weapon, standing behind while 
keeping them snared and not using frenzy.  Despite my abyssimal skill, 
they still end up dying before long, plus there's the nuisance of 
keeping them snared.

I gave up on doing this after a while, I'm afraid, having taken my 2hp 
skill up to a towering 5.

I don't have a pocket druid or shaman to keep me in regen, it might be 
possible to go pay to have things cast on me in POK but I'd want 
something with a healthy duration.
