I can see the Bitter Warriors Club has weighed in.  I never said that I
wanted Knights to tank as well or better than warriors, I only said that SOE
should not create an expansion where they are less than adequate tanks.  The
fact is that it was a big mistake and SOE is pretty much admitting it with
the changes.  Balancing what advantage each class brings to the table in
terms of tanking and soloability is for SOE to work with, but leaving
knights out in the cold, so to speak, was not smart.

I think SOE said in the patch that it was for helping low and mid-level
characters and that it was in no way part of the melee balancing, so, no, I
won't talk to you about the new regen when discussing GoD.
