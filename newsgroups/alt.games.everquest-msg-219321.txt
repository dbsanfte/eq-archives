It's an unmoderated newsgroup, so, yes, technically, anyone can post 
anything here that they want.  If enough people get uptight about it and 
complain, maybe the posters ISP will do something about it, but I would 
not hold my breath.  Personally, I just KF anyone who posts crap, and 
don't worry about it.

At least you are honest.

And annoying to the vast majority of us here, at a guess.

Again, this is an unmoderated newsgroup, so, noone will remove a post.  
You really need to learn a bit about usenet.

Spam here as much as you like, do it a whole lot, I recommend doing so in 
many other newsgroups too, there are lots of related ngs that I am sure 
would be thrilled to see it.
