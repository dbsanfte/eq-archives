Where are you going with that? Nobody said it was the end of the world 
and you had to roll a new character. But death is not meaningless in EQ. 
As a newbie and a lowbie, death is *still* amaziningly inconvenient.

Getting your corpse back, even via DoN, is still a pain. It still 
requires several zone hops to get back to where you were. And if you 
don't get a rez as part of the DoN summon package you could lose an hour 
of play or more (particularly irritating if soloing xp comes slow, or if  
farming greens with 0xp incoming, and taking a death do a random red 
popping on your ass...)

Getting a rez in the guild lobby isn't that hard, but it can take time.

Amend to some classes require long waits for groups and I'll go with it. 
Clerics never seem to have long waits unless they're really particular 
about where they want to go.

See above.
