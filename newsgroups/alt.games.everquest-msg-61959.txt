    You may not want to be there when it first comes up. Other than the
amazing lag, inevitable bugs, etc. that always accompany a new release (and
especially one that's moving to some new standards), you'd also get slapped
with some of the brand new "anti-main tank strategy" measures they've put
into SoL. As the main tank for your guild, you may not enjoy it much.

    (As an example of one of these rumoured measures: a *very* high damage,
close range AoE to force the "main tank" out to about the same range as the
other melees.)
