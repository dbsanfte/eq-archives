It also killed the need for a druid. Clerics and enchanters can sell their
abilities all the time in PoK but the number of times I hear a call for a
port is pretty darn rare. Now if there were ports to the zones the books
didn't cover, then maybe they'd be back in vogue. But with ldon, everyone
just seems to want to do the adventures in lfay, and i've only once done one
in oasis. I don't even know what the other ones look like because the
perception is that the lfay ones are the easiest.

The boats didn't work well. You could practise languages, true, but even
fishing was a problem, and there were never any sea monsters or anything to
make it feel like you were playing. In AD&D,  you could spice up the trip
with dangerous weather, icebergs, sea serpents and other beasts of assorted
levels who might swarm on board, or just look for a market for their wares.
("Pearls, landlubber! As big as your fist!")

I think it would be possible to make boat travel interesting but it might
take a fair bit of work. Otherwise, just letting people pay to travel
instantaneously would convey a bit of the feel and not totally deprive
porters of a market. 50 or a 100 pp for a ticket through dangerous waters
might be about right, perhaps just a few gold for a short hop across a safe
area.. after all guards don't come cheap. An instanced adventure aboard a
ship could be cool although the level range would be an issue. Still playing
a guard aboard a vessel would be a lot of fun... same with caravans and
other such expeditions.
