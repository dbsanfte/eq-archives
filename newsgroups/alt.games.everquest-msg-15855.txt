Positions? No, Larry, questions. You know, the rather simple query that you
have willfully ignored?

It is okay. Like your decision to not own up to your not-very-thinly-veiled
racism, you have also chosen not to own up to the fact that your post was
little more than a childish rant of frustration. That's fine. Had you simply
acknowledged that from the start, you would have never accidentally revealed
your narrow-mindedness. But you have.

Your delusions are almost worthy of pity. Almost. But since you've called me
a liar with no basis, attempted to poke fun at what you assume is my
ethnicity, and here claim that I have made statements I have never made -
i.e., told you or anybody else what should or should not be posted - I will
assume that you are as ignorant as you've made yourself look. That, my
friend, earns you the right to not waste my time anymore. It will be
pleasant for me because I will not see your posts anymore, and it will be
pleasant for you because you will no longer be prompted to accidentally
expose yourself for what you are.

Feel free to have the last word, Larry.
