I've found it's a nice toy for making soloing less tedious (I am an
avid root dotter when I am stuck doing that instead of grouping). 
And the sparklies are pretty :)

We're not a large guild so we never really get to have horrid overkill
situations, but we've managed to pull of quite a few things with low
resources and 'non-ideal' classes.

/blush

Actually, we had no rangers there, it was our 56 cleric ;) 
We had 60 monk, 59 rogue, 55 warrior, 54 57 and 58 paladins, 56 57 and
58 wizards, 55 magician, 55 56 56 and 57(me) druids, 56 and 60
clerics, and 54 bard. Fay lasted two and a half minutes.

I also got some nice screenshots of the overgrown fish for a change :)
