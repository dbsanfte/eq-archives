See below for what we came up with, in brief form.  I feel it addressed a
lot of these things, and would have been even better than the current
situation for multi tank groups.   The situation you've described really
just has the knight acting as puller and substandard DPS, which isn't really
a huge role.   And while I can see how that might work for SK's, what does
that do for paladins?  Once lull stops working for them at (mob level) 55,
they have no advantage pulling over the warrior.

Which is one of the things I thought should be fixed.

The rough form of the solution we hammered out was this.   Modifications of
the warrior's aggressive and defensive disciplines.

Remove the DPS penalty from being in defensive (or evasive) modes. (and IMO,
cut the mitigation from 30 to 20 or so percent.)   This would give warriors
a real, concrete advantage in tanking, as they take much less damage from
opponents.  Healers would need less mana to heal them, and they could
survive much more, offsetting the penalty from the group having to reduce
DPS by controlling aggro.    You would have to choose between which type of
"better tanking" you wanted. Raid power would not be changed as much, as
they were already balanced around the idea that a defensive warrior would be
constantly tanking them.  Any advantages gained would be more than offset by
the cut to mitigation.

On the other side, modify aggressive so that it gives a meaningful DPS
boost, turning a non-tanking warrior into a psuedo DPS class.  Nothing
excessive, but able to make a real contribution.  And drop the re-used
timers, so the disciplines can be used most of the time.

Multi-tank groups would not only still be possible, but I think they would
work out even better.    Knight tanks the common mobs while the warrior
assumes an agressive fighting stance.   Named up ahead, cool.   Warrior
assumes a defensive fighting stance, and the knight hands off aggro to the
person with the most survivability, the warrior. After the mob dies, then
back to normal.    Single tank groups would still work fine as well, you
would just have to choose between harder fights with the named, as the
knight is tanking the whole thing, or reductions to DPS from the warrior
tanking the whole thing while everyone else controls aggro.

The mobs would have to be tuned to it of course.
