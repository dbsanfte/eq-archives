    Heh.  That might actually work.

    Mid-list before the numbers were hidden, bottom of list
now. As someone earlier noted, that would make Drinal one of
the most populous servers.  In my playing, however, I've 
not noticed it being more crowded.  In fact, ever since 
Terrible Tuesday, it has seemed to be fairly light.
   How are the other servers holding up?
