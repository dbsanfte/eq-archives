And if they want to rob the local 7-11, they will.  That doesn't mean we
don't have a responsiblity to raise them with a bit better judgement.
Having the school had out condoms is adding another pressure on to the "just
do it" side.  Yeah, they'll do it if they want, but that doesn't mean we
have to endorse it.  I haven't been an adult so long as to not recall what
it was like to be in high school.

You're "either or" situation is incorrect.  The fact that they do not have a
condom can, has, and will continue to prevent many from having sex.  Hell,
I've been told by a girl that she wasn't willing because I didn't have
protection handy.  Didn't get any that night, that's life.  I find the
"they'll do it one way or another" to be a vast over-simplification of all
the pressures affecting the decision.
