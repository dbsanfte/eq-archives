Took my 43 bard to kael for some adventure.  Was about to leave because I
couldnt find a group but then got a tell that I could join with a 51 rogue
and 53 shaman.  So ok.  Shaman is outside (wl) getting sow on.  He comes
back in and spends the next 15 minutes buffing and wincing (wth is that?).
Then starts pulling.  First pull goes fine.  Second pull brings 2 adds and
he drops before even getting back.  Zone, get rez, buff buff buff, wince
wince wince.  Pull again, success.  53 warr joins.  Now shaman says play
invis bard, we going deeper.  Hmm.  I'm here for adventure so ok.  We run
all the way up almost to where they start seeing invis I think.  Pull one,
fine.  Another, fine.  Then pull 2 together.  Shaman falls so quick I didnt
even see him.  Again to the zone.  I guess I'm lucky I'm so low level they
didnt notice me.
