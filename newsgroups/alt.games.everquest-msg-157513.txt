The big foul up at Sony is that they make expansions go live the day they
are supposed to be available in stores.  The right way to do this is have
availability in stores be on day X, and start pushing the patch files then,
but not enable playing the expansion until day X+14.

That would allow everyone who really wants to be there on opening day to be
there, and it would give people outside the US a chance to arrange for a
friend to buy it on day X and ship it to them in time for X+14.
