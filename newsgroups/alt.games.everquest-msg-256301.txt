Berserker epic has this effect on it, according to Lucy its
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4725&setcookie=1

a 7 AC buff.

Wow, thats EPIC, too bad I already have turtle boots which give me a 10 
AC buff

Tell me I'm reading something wrong?

The description on the epic itself says rage of keras is attack speed, 
AC, and attack rating buff, as you can see looking at

http://allakhazam.com/equipment/fpics/kerasian_axe_of_ire.jpg

Now looking at the weapon itself it says 40% haste and 40% attack, and 
the effect seems to be worn rather than a proc.  So perhaps the rage is 
giving the stats?

Or if its a proc, well then thats entirely different, would mean 80% 
haste unbuffed and +80 attack

And if the duration on it is 7.5 minutes, as suggested by the Lucy page, 
then you could put it on till it procs and then put a Elemental/GOD era 
weapon in for 7 minutes and still reap epic benefits, sort of like using 
Primal/Prismatic weapons, or (on a much lesser scale) like me proccing 
the DS on my Two Handed Practice Sword periodically, then switching back 
to my Reaver.

If it is a worn effect, that only ever appears on BER epic, then why put 
a duration on it at all?   And for that matter, why bother putting it 
in, when you could just put the attack and haste and AC directly on the 
item, is there ever a time when a worn effect doesn't work just as stats 
on the item itself?

ps, why on earth is the delay on this thing 37, instead of something 
higher?  The ratio is nice, but the damage bonus is tiny compared to 
what it would be with something a bit slower!
