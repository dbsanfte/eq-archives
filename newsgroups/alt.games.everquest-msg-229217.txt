Halfling rogue is tempting... if they don't have see invis up, they lose
target on you when you hide. With sneak you are mobile. You can use a bow
(not much but great for sniping tank types that just finished beating down
an orc). You can wear as good armor as anyone is likely to get in one month
of server chaos.

Otherwise mage or necro of some sort... gnome is easier to conceal yourself
as (never underestimate the power of a short person in pvp, though EQ
doesn't have the modern game's bushes and grasses in as great a quantity).
Dark elf would have a vision advantage in many quarters, but that is a tiny
tiny advantage. The hide is a 30% or so lifesaver though. (poof where'd he
go).

A charming enchanter at that level doesn't have the tools that the high
levels use to wipe the walls with their charmed pets and survive. And
charming is based on the concept 'I'll die, but I'll get so much exp in the
process a death or three a night won't matter'.

Now a bard, that would be a good idea...
