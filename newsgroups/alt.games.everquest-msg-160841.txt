Heh, Magician = self-magnifying caster.  I looked up the focus
effects and it looks to me like I'd need to raise my WIS from
135 to over 200 and have Flowing Thought 4 to match the effect
my focus items have on Root/DoTing efficiency, which accounts
for the overwhelming majority of my mana usage at this point
in the character's career (L30 Druid).

I do have a question tho, is there a site with a table showing
the Mage focus items with their slot, effect, and level limits
(including level minimums for item use)?
