Getting trained in Blackburrow is hardly anything out of the ordinary but
getting trained by anyone over 25 is.
Nothing aggro's at that level so the train was likely intentional. I doubt
there was a particular target, more of a "I wonder how big a train I can
make" type of idea, in other words lame.
Gotta agree, posting here, bitching at someone directly is futile (and
cowardly, you may have put up the accused's name but you never left your
own, Fred) but I'd be upset, too if some 50 plus made a train for the hell
of it.

Just out of interest, anyone know, will someone sitting on a horse draw
aggro in the same way as someone sitting on the ground? Maybe it wasn't
quite so intentional, although at that level, clearing up your own mess is
hardly a problem in BlackBurrow. If the situation happens again, right that
person off as a moron and get on with it, if you have to have words keep
them polite, with any luck the other person will come out with the
obsceneties and threats then use /report /petition.
