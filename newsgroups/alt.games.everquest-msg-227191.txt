Improved Heal and Mana Preservation items are freakishly hard to get. Ornate
arms and boots being the *easiest ones* and they costs 100k+ on my server if
anyone ever sells. Ceramic item is a good choice but still 70-80k. On my
server the elemental dropped components are hoarded and never sold. Perhaps
on other servers this is different.

Anyways I dont think anyone could just expect a healer to just "pick up"
anything with either of these foci easily.
