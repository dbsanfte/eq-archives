/agree
What he said. The only minor nit is that I've understood it was 
approaching 600k subscriptions at its peak. So between 500k and 600k 
instead of 'just 500k'. In any case 2M might be total boxes containing 
the base game sold or something, but there has never been any where near 
2M active subscriptions.
