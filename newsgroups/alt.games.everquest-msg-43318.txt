I went from 14 to 17 fear kiting crocs of all flavors in Oasis, both
grouping and solo. Once you get to 17, if you like to solo, go to the
Overthere.

After the boat hits the zone into the Overthere, swim to the coastline and
head left as far as you can go. At the corner of the zone you'll see a
penninsula of land jutting out into the water, you can make that your home
to level 24 easily. At 24, even with track, blues and above become scarce in
that area.

You can easily run out sowed, grab a critter with snare and pull it back to
the penninsula, and kite it there. I normally snare, root, and dot them to
death. I personally hunted there till 24, and you don't have to worry about
walk-through aggros (except for the very occasional sarnak) or the dreaded
'goons, in that area.

Nothing in the zone will aggro on you except sarnaks and the 'goons, so it's
a very safe place to hunt. The loot isn't fantastic, but still decent. You
can sell at the mudhole nearby, and I'd recommend binding near the WW
zoneline, just in case something gets out of hand. I always kept gate
memmed, and always kept panic animal  memmed. The animals there (tigers and
rhinos) won't turn away when low on health, and it's more mana effecient to
fear and melee them when they are nearly dead, than to have to result to a
nuke, or re-root.

I highly recommend that little area for any soloing low level druids, I
never even came close to dieing there, the experience is great, and you
don't have to worry about someone accidentally KS'ing your rooted mob.
