I was amiable to my underground rogue trainers after one set of trips, 
all the way up from dubious, but even repeated sets of trips whenever I 
was in the area never budged coalition of tradefolk.  I think the guards 
are amiable now, although I can't say for sure.  Couldn't tell you about 
the others because by the time I went anywhere near HHK I'd already 
massively altered my faction by killing orcs in HHP, and by the time I 
went near Qeynos, I'd done the same by turning in ears in HHK.

Doing the orc pawn picks turn-in to the guy in East Freeport, otoh, got 
me to apprehensive from glower in just 2 or 3 bags worth of picks.  And 
newbs'll sell em for 5 gold each happily, considering they go for 8 
copper to the merchants (of course you'll want to check the merchants 
first, as they sell them for only 1 gold and change, but their being 
non-stackable makes it difficult to pick up a heck of a lot that way 
unless you have money to burn buying up their other shit, and then, you 
might as well offer 1pp per pick and *really* make the newbs work hard 
for those picks :))
