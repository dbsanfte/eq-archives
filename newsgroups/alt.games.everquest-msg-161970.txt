*shrug*  Monks were great for a long time, now they're merely very
good.  If the "quality" of your playtime is the issue, as it appears
to be from what you say, then you either need to find places where
you can solo, or perhaps try another class.  I am in the same boat
(and I notice Bodi speaks of it as well), which is why my "main" is
only level 54 after nearly 3-1/2 years (solo = so slow for Paladin
exp).  I did finally try a Druid (on FV server) and he's a lot of
fun, but Kaev is still my "main" and probably always will be.  It
doesn't really bother me that I can't solo as well as a caster, if
it did I'd have abandoned my Paladin for a Druid or Necro long ago.
As trite and pollyannaish as it sounds, the trick is to enjoy what
you've got rather than wish for what you don't or pine for what you
lost.

Well, they let Necros and Druids play that way.  :-p  And other casters
can to some degree, and Beastlords appear to be by far the best hybrid
solo.  Well equipped Monks used to be pretty decent solo characters, but
the feature that made them so (defense superior to any tank) was very
unbalanced group-wise, so it's hardly shocking that it was changed.

Also, Bodi says he's leaving because of the time commitment necessary
to play the high level game, not because of the Monk "nerf".  That's
the same for any class, if you want to kill the big bosses and you
want the "uber" gear you've got to be able and willing to put in the
time to do it.  That's just the way it is, and your ability to solo
is not a factor there.
