    Yeah I'm going to have to considering the number of people who
dissagree, for myself at least. I naturally originally assumed it went on
damage but later came to the agro conclusion based on observations.

    Yes taunt and agro spells only, no doubt some ripostes but at the time
riposte didn't do more damage than the character I was PLing, yes they took
most of the mob's hitpoints themselves, no we weren't grouped. Basically
whenever the mob died while facing me they got nothing - hence my thoughts
regarding agro.

    Strangely I had the opposite experience.

    What are they, just out of interest? (the caveats to removal of credit
for damage done that is)

    On your suggestion and others I'll look into it further in game, thanks
for your info - but my curiousity has got the better of me now :)
