}These ones are at least recognized by Agent to be quote markers (the
}ones below aren't by default). But they all have the same flaw - with
}non fixed size fonts they are very narrow and therefore very hard on
}the eyes. The last one, the one Annie likes, is the worst of all.
}But if those are what you are going to choose from, might as well keep
}what you are using now. They're all as narrow or even narrower than }.

Heh, think I'll keep what I've got, then. :)  I see colon and pipe used by 
other folks often enough to impinge on my sense of uniqueness.  I was 
kinda hoping ] would be a favored choice.

Or I could go back to the really mean choice of '<' and hose up anyone 
whose newsreader ignores spurious HTML tags. :)

}I wouldn't even read replies by someone using those two. :-p

Ya, those were pretty much red herrings. :)
