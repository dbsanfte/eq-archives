I am sharing the cable connection between 3 PC's but noticed when I used a
Router (Dlink 704?)  about a year ago I had a lot of packet loss quite
regularily and getting relatively large interrupts in the data flow. End use
wise it was like playing EQ through an analogue modem re-train. In the end I
got sick of tweaking and bit the bullet, brough a switch and got an
additional 2 IP addresses from Tel$tra.

Sure it was an extra 20 dollars a month on the account but it has been worth
it. It immediately fixed the packet loss problems and interrupts and as a
bonus from that point I no longer became the "home system admin". The "other
users"* could ghost their machines till their hearts content, reformat their
hard drives and generally fubar things on a regular basis without me having
to get involved.

It has been the best $20 a month I have spent.


"end users"* - Okay, I admit, I am 30 and living back with the parents.
Pathetic really but it's no use anyone trying to flame me since I will only
agree with them : ) In my defense I tend to go through girlfriends at a
great rate of knots** and it's the most convenient place to have my homebase
setup.

**Okay - this isn't looking better - why don't I just shut?
