I'd like to see my top speed be either my natural speed or that of the 
mount, whichever is greater; assume that if you can SOW me you can SOW 
my horse too.

But insofar as combat from horseback goes, perhaps stirrups haven't been 
invented yet.   Before stirrups, horses were little more than a 
transport mechanism; get people to a fight faster, but then they 
dismount for the battle.

Course that just begs for a gnome tinkered device to solve the problem...
