yep, definite newbies.  newbie advice:   talk to one another.  set up a
priority on what to kill first.  at your level you probably always want to
kill the most dangerous things first.  Everyone should be targeting on the
same critter.  That kills the critters the fastest.  Enemy Casters are
definitely easy to kill but dangerous, so fighting dervs they should be
targeted first.  Enemy Healers are also very dangerous, so they need to be
targeted second, after the Enemy Casters (wizards/mages/necros/enchanters).

As to tanks deciding what to kill:  after the enchanter sets up general
strategy.   The enchanter if in group should be telling people generally
what needs to be done and the general strategy regarding who to target
first.  If the enchanter doesn't know what he is doing enough to be able to
set up a general strategy, the group will be less effective.  Also the
enchanter knows which mezzes are going to wear off first, so he should be
suggesting next targets after first one is killed off.  This is mostly for
using his mana effectively, more than anything else.  Often battles are not
as organized unless the main tank / main assist follows these suggestions.

Around 51st level, enchanters want to be able to drain mana off casters, and
mezz becomes more reliable with proper CHA.  Theft of Thought allows
enchanters to get about a bub worth of free mana with one cast, and with
mezzing, could conceivably get TWO or THREE free bubs of mana with 1 or 2
mezzes.  Thus enchanters who have TOT and plan to use it will NOT want you
killing off casters as first priority.  Its also advisable to enchanters to
get TOT and if fighting alot of casters have the spell mem'ed in one of your
slots.

Had one close fight with my 13th druid at that time who recently hit 14th,
who was fighting a lego by himself.  Someone else pulled him, and no one was
whacking him.  being the only healer in the group, I knew I was a goner, and
the group would follow.  I pretty much wasn't organizing the group because
we were dominating so much that it didn't matter.  This one fight though
who-ever pulled it didn't know what they were doing and things were getting
ugly fast.  Luckily with commanding everyone to attack the lego (toughest
and most dangerous critter), and getting a Lay on Hands from the Paladin, we
barely pulled it out with no one dying, although it was close.  We had like
4 people (major twinked druid with 189 wis (me), pally, and two rogues) with
no enchanter and had 4 or 5 critters on us, with one of them being a lego
who was definitely tougher than any one of us.

If I didn't start communicating real real fast to tell everyone to attack
the lego, then I couldn't of been freed to heal and we would of been looking
at TPW.  Bottom line: communicate and tell people if /when your in trouble.

 If you have people around to help you who know your in trouble and ready to
help you, your better standing still and letting them whack the critter than
running around like a chicken with your head cut off.  In the reverse it
often seems better to run to avoid getting overly smacked upon until you do
get help, so definitely run if your in trouble until your close enough to
someone who can/will help.  usually the best situation is running directly
to someone and asking for help, and then standing still.  The yell command
was made specifically for this type of situation.  use it.  /YELL

If your group is looking at a total party wipe out, you need to start
considering others around you who could help.  Another party close by who is
bored out of the gord often will help.  If they are pissed at you though,
often they wanna see you die, so they might just drop by just to watch and
laugh.  Getting along with others is almost always a good idea.

Kill stealing almost always pisses off groups and if allowed to fester is
almost always a bad thing.  Being diplomatic about this is always important.
Share how your group is feeling about this to the other group, and the
negotiate some way to rectify this situation.  the main reason about
rectifying this situation is in case you do get too many things to fight,
you will have people willing to help who won't just drop by to cheer  the
monsters.
