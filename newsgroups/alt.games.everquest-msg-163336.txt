Centi LS goes for around 2k on The Rathe. Which is why I don't have one. I'd
love to have one for my Warrior or Ranger, but not at that price. I'm MUCH
happier having spent 200pp (yes, 200pp) for a Centi SS, and buying other,
more useful gear. (I'll admit I want the LS more for the graphics than the
stats.....sad, huh?)

My Ranger still looks cool, though. I bought a Brightwood Spear for 300pp,
which I have him use to raise his Piercing skill, and I have him carry it
when he isn't fighting. (He alternates between a Coldain Velium Long Sword
and Icetooth's Claws when using 1HS; not high enough to Dual Wield yet)
