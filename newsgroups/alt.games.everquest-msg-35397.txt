You shouldn't feel bad about it. Okay, 20 pp IS very low. But I myself 
always start selling at around 60% of the prices I find on eqprices.com 
and allakhazam.com as all prices are insanely high. I have been known to 
sell good equipment for virtually nothing as well. So you shouldn't feel 
bad. He's not the only one selling so low.
