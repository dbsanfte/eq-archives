I"m told that on normal servers, augments are No Drop, and putting one on an
item, even a normally droppable one, makes it No Drop.  While I haven't
actually seen an augmented item on the FV server, the fact that the Augments
are No Drop leads me to suspect the same thing happens there as on normal
servers.  If thats the case then they won't be sellable.  Plus I haven't seen
anyone auctioning such a service or more likely, selling augmented items of
their own which they have made.  Are you saying you have seen augmented items
and they aren't No Drop?
