30 minutes.

Another way to do it is to get the necro in place with the Rapier,
then bind him there and have a friend duel him to death.  No exp
loss, and the Rapier will be stored safely on the corpse for
however long it takes (up to a week, of course).  When ready to
do the necro half of the multi-quest, the necro simply loots
the Rapier from his "storage corpse" and turns it in.
