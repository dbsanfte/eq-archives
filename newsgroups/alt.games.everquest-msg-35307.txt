And?!? So????? What is you're point??? We really could care less about 
your insignificant little site. You come here and spam the newsgroup for 
people to come look at it and we do. What do we find?? Crap newbies know 
before they get the game from the store and then you come back and whine 
here under an UNRELATED post???? Get bent... and before that get fixed 
so you can't reproduce.
