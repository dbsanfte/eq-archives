I have to admit, what I would like to see is a selection screen 
sort of like the face one but with different armor looks - I hate 
my rangers helmet, the little sort of smurf hat...[ok, modified 
phrygian helm] I dont think that it would really kill gameplay to 
let me have a classic sphagenhelm, or even the closefitting cap 
that my mage has, or instead of my cleric having that clunky 
angular leg armor, the neat sleek flame stuff that my de necro 
has. I know I like the HElf look of the long panel skirt [sort of 
like an indian loincloth] I would love to be able to click 
through and get different 'racial' graphics, and perhaps opt to 
have a regular helm have no graphics at all.
