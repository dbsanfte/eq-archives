You know, there is a reason why the Frozen Jesus is now level 60 as
compared to before when he was level 58...

Seems, if you charm said Frozen Jesus (using Dictate obviously), and
had a shaman hit him with Avatar, Frozen Jesus would chain flurry.
The subsequent damage output was so obscenely high, there's been
reports of guilds using Frozen Jesus to drop Tormax in something close
to just one or two minutes.

So yes, stat buffs do impact pets.
