I play on Stormhammer and Cazic Thule.  Server doesn't matter.  If it's a
day that I'm having CTD problems, it's going to happen.  Very rare problem
for me though, maybe one day a month it'll boot me.  One thing I always tell
people when this happens is to check temps inside the case if possible.  My
old setup had all kinds of problems with CTD and it turned out that the
screens for the vents were all gunked up and I was overheating.  Upgraded to
a 5 fan Coolmax case and now it's rare that anything like that happens.
Just something else to think about.

Jason
