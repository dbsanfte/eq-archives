Even if you don't want to craft, you'll probably know some crafters who can
use anything useful you harvest.

Also, because of the way these things spawn, even if all you care about is
fishing, you'll have a better chance of finding fish if you clear out the
other types of things that spawn in the zone.  (Well, as long as other
people are clearing them out, it doesn't matter, of course, and fish are the
ones that many people don't bother with...so if you are going to concentrate
on only one and ignore the others, I suppose fish are the best choice!)
