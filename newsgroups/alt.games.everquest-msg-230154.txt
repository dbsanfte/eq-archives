The troll may well have been working on Katta faction, killing MS guards 
I believe gives you positive Katta faction hits.  True newbie guards are 
generally very very difficult to kill.  They are extremely magic 
resistant, and are undercons generally, and not worth the effort.  This 
is why you won't see someone doing the freeport gate guards for example.  
The wandering guards in various zones, and the guards outside of newbie 
areas are generally fair game.  It was quite inconsiderate of you to 
train him, knowing he was there.  He should not be surprised if he does 
get trained, as he is fighting at a zone line, the first place anyone 
would run to to avoid death.

Not sure what, if any faction, the bard might have been working on, dark 
elf factions maybe, or maybe just doing it for the easy cash, and maybe 
xp he got.
