Ninja - give the rogue Feign Death and better hand-to-hand (not as
good as monks though) but change them from chain to silk armors and
with a monk-like weight penalty.  Perhaps they'd have back-slash when
using ninja-only weapons insteaad of back-stab.  I don't see a need
for illusions as these rogues/ninjas can sneak and hide.
