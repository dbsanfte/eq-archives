But if they did, once it was discovered (which it would have been - and,
incase this point was missed, the Gm did say it was not looted by a member
of my guild), their ass would be back in nToV and first broods, no ifs or
buts.

There is absolutely no guild at AoW level or above, on Prexus, who would
take a ninja.

We lost our last gimp guild who would (and is now AoW-capable) with the
opening of that new MS server - /wave infinite vision :)
