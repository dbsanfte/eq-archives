Dear PB:  I was having all kinds of problems with my Voodoo 5 (maybe I
didn't know how to clean my system, etc) but I purchased a geforce 2 ultra
and have cleaned all kinds of 3dfx files out of basic memory and registry
and I still have 3dfx .dll files hanging around.  And, I still cant get on
EQ for more than a couple minutes at best.  Do I just need to reload windows
98?  (specs: AMD 750, 256 Ram, Win 98SE, I got the miniport from amd, I got
Direct X 8.0a, I put detonator 3 in as the drivers.)  I don't know what else
to do.  appreciate any suggestions. :-)

Bob
