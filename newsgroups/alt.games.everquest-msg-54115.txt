Which is the real reason why you should quit, because you find it boring.

I have a goal already, to pass the time without spending cash.

With EQ I have managed to save a fortune (only to clear up debts, mind you)
Yes the game is addictive, yes some people give up there lives to play but
then maybe they didn't have much of a (social)life in the first place. Who
knows, who cares, people do what they want by their own choice. You want to
spend you sundays singing hymms good luck to you, you want to get wasted on
whatever chemicals you get hold of, more luck to you (you'll need it) do
what makes you happy but don't be so self righteous (that's my job) to think
that you can tell others how to live their lives. Now begone, get out into
the big wide world and get yourself laid (I think you're the one who needs
it)
