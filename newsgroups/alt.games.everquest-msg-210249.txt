Well, you won't need level II focus until you get spells that are higher
than level 20, and even then you may find that you don't get spells the
focus will help for in that next batch and can get by on focus I even
longer, say to 29 or 34.  Say for example you just got a heal at 19, and
don't get your next one till 29, well, even though you'd need an IH II item
to help out your level 24 heal, if you don't have one then the IH I item
will keep helping your level 19 heal just fine.

Thats not to say you shouldn't keep an eye out for the II items, of course,
just saying that there isn't as much a rush as you might think, particularly
on some of them.

Another interesting line of focus you haven't mentioned is the Enchantment
stuff; extended enhancement makes your buffs last longer, which saves you
mana on top of the mana conservation because you are casting less often;
this is particulary handy on classes like Shaman or Mages, who cast high
cost buffs with high frequency (haste in the one case, DS in the other).
Enhancement haste isn't nearly as important, since you rarely are in a big
hurry to spam out buffs, its nice but nothing that will markedly improve
play.

What class are you, might be more specific if I knew whether your "Healer"
is a cleric, shaman, druid, or heck, paladin, ranger, beastlord or
necromancer or just a mage with a copy of summon bandages!
