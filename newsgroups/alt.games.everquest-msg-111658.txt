I agree, but I guess it just depends on the nature of the character.  Some
see it as a hassle to help people out, and I guess from their point of view
it is.  Personally, I play a mage and I do everything I can to help.  I'll
summon people focus items if they ask, lev rings, food, water, arrows, DS
newbies when Im running through EC, you name it.  Basically because I just
like being nice to other players.  If you're finding that helping other
people is ruining your EQ experience, then don't do it.
