I can relate an odd EQ experience. When I started playing EQ, I played
on the Rallos Zek PvP server. There was a guy playing a DE necro named
Benign, and we started running together, pee-kaying, and doing typical
EQ stuff. In those days, Rallos Zek was totally open PvP, no teams or
anything, but despite that, Benign and I were hard-core about only
peekaying "lighties".

Well time went by, and eventually I decided to try out a different
character class. When I started leveling up this new toon, I lost
touch with my former buddy. One day, I was running through eastern
commonlands when I noticed an obnoxious halfling shouting inanities to
the zone.

Eventually, I tracked this druid down, dueled him, and lost. After we
got through fighting I was talking to the obnoxious druid for awhile,
when the druid suddenly recognizes me as his former killing partner
back when he was playing Benign the necro! So, here we had managed to
encounter each other again, both with completely different toons, and
still were able to identify each other (I guess our role-playing
skills could use some work!).


Now this was kinda odd, but it's not quite over. When the team PVP
servers came out, I pretty quickly fled from Rallos, which had become
a scary place with uber pk's hunting you for your prized gear. I
eventually ended up on Sullon Zek, and guess who also had made the
move there? Yep, the very same Benign, though now he was an enchanter.

The capper to all this is that on the Sullon Zek server there is an
entire unrelated guild called "Benign". My buddy used to joke that
they were his worshippers. I miss that guy. If the pattern holds,
we'll probably virtually meet each other again while playing something
like BF:1942, or EQ2.
