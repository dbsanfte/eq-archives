I would guess that's probably just fine.  As I recall, EQ haste caps at
100% (meaning, in EQ math, twice as fast).  So, getting two swings in
the same second with a sufficiently slow 2-hander should be
mathematically impossible.  Hence, 2-swings-in-a-second would HAVE to
be double attack, rather than maybe double attack, maybe just fast
swing speed.  Poof, ambiguity gone. :)  If all you want is swing speed,
just ignore the second log entry in a single second.

Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood you.  Indeed, the ambiguity remains when
parsing faster (i.e. one-handed) weapons, if the character has both
melee haste and double attack, even if two different weapon types are
used.  Happily, most classes can use some kind of 2-handed weapon.
Bards (the subject of the original question) cannot use 2-handed
weapons, but they also only get double attack through AA, so some bard
somewhere should be able to do a clean test.
