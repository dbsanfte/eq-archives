Well biz, pretty much the whole freaking game is designed for groups.
And imo, that's a good thing.  Not that that's ever stopped determined
soloers, "where there's a will there's a way".  I'd be very concerned
if ever they started designing things specificly for soloers, as it is
their group-friendly content always seems to end up soloable in whole
or in part.  I really don't see you solo-by-choice folks as sufferring
in EQ.
