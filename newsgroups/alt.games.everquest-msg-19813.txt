Thanks for the tip.  Had an enchanter yelling at us the other night 
(semi-frustrated, still friendly, thank goodness) because we were all 
fighting different mobs - all of us were afraid to break off and hit the 
OTHER one in case it was the mezzed one. :)  Now if only I can remember 
this in the heat of battle...
