Sorry, but what contradiction. At the moment EQ is suffering a strange
breakdown. Hardcore gamers leaving. People not satisfied with
game play. CS almost non-exisitant.
It's in a Death-Rattle at the moment and POP will be the hands that
finish it off. But still for SWG to be at half of the "current " EQ
pop. is "impressive", considering it's not even out yet.
And please, anyone who even thinks SWG won't be a Cash Cow for 
Sony/Vereant a crazy, The same for EQ2. 
Now that Planetfall game is another story. I see that going nowhere.
And EQ Adventure looks cool. The cool thing there is everyone will
have the same hardware, a PS2.
So same graphics,which by the way are better that the Luclin graphics.
I can't see anyway of Hacking into a PS2, so less of that.
And a PS2 is much,much cheaper than a new PC.
