I'm not sure if he means what he says there.  I have <never> had a stun
land and fail to interrupt a caster.  I have, however, had Bash fail to
interrupt a caster many times.  I myself have also channelled thru many
Bash attacks that mobs have landed.  It appears to me that a Bash attack
has four possible outcomes:  (1) miss, (2) hit for normal damage only,
(3) hit for normal damage and interrupt spell cast (as if momentarily
stunned), and (4) hit for normal damage and stun for 3(?) seconds (also
interrupts a cast).

At about his level (early/mid forties) I noticed that I seemed to be
only rarely interupting casters anymore.  I gradually stopped using
sword 'n board because of this (it didn't help that I didn't have a
decent 1H weapon at that time).  Once I got my Luclin stuns (Cease
and Desist) I quit using one handers entirely, except to get my 1HS
skill ups after I hit 51.  Just recently, shortly before I dinged
54, I was trying to get all my melee skills that were near level cap
up to their repective caps, even the "useless" Bash.  I was surprised
to discover that I was getting a lot more interrupts than I recalled,
and also doing a lot more damage (i.e. max more than doubled) than I
recalled.  I think that maybe it's a post-50 thing.  Either that or
there was a stealth upgrade that occurred when I wasn't looking.  I
now am using sword 'n board even soloing certain melee mobs despite
the lower damage output the fights are a tad easier than with my
2hander, the extra AC and the occassional stun from bash reduce the
damage I take from fast hitting melees (Darkpaw Warrior, for example)
by enough to compensate.

Oh, and Sanjian, you can solo blues, just not very fast.  No, make that
excruciatingly slowly.  Any mob you can root semi-reliably (i.e. half
your roots stick for full duration) you should be able to defeat, if
you have room to back off without drawing adds.  Once you make 45 a
Deepwater Helm will make it much easier and faster, you'll be able to
solo xp at roughly 1/10th the rate of a quad-kiter...  :-p
