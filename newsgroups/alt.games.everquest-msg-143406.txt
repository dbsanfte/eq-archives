Nah . At the very least it significantly raises the effort required to be a
complete ass as the goverment. Waco was a good example in that they had to
send SO much manpower and capability to deal with the problem and even so
the goverment ended up looking like complete numbskulls. If the people arent
armed it is a fairly trivial matter to just round em up and mow em down.
Sorta like the chineese goverment did, or the soviet goverment did , or the
german goverment did , or etc .....
