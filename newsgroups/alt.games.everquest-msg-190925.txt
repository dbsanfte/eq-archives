Consider the problems there already are with balancing classes. Do we
really need another class?

If they do add another class, what would it be? Is there some role
available that isn't already well filled? Rogue/caster hybrid (ninja!)
perhaps, but what role could they fill in game? Melee/nuker, but that
wouldn't really work, I think. Anyone have any good ideas?
