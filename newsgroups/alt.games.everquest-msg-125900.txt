    I'd say go with the AC and resist increase the Ry'Gorr gives you,
despite that one bad incident. ;-) The only caveat I have is this: would
removing the Bloodstained Tunic drop you below 75 AGI? I know my cleric wore
hers for the longest time because dropping below 75 AGI gives a hefty AC
penalty (on her it was 40 points!)
