Ok, I know where Bondl is. Now, finding him with a Bard had me
passing numerous guards. Question: Can these guards see through
invis? If some can, which ones exactly? Do I run into risks
following Bondl or in the Jade Tiger Inn or anything, if I try
to enter Freeport as an Iksar with invisibility (no, killing
1300 orcs for faction is not someting I want to do .. VI got
really stupid ideas sometimes...). Any comments?
