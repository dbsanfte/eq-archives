I never said it wasn't a game. I said it was irrelevant. Completely 
different sentiment.

I also was responding to considering the entirety of gameplay over the 
individual experience. By "individual" we mean -a person- not an aspect 
of gameplay.

That is, we must consider the 'health of the game environment' over 
maximising each individuals experience. 

For example, in a single player game you can provide cheats to let 
players get extra health and power or weapons and ammo, or even 
invulnerability... good players don't need them and enjoy the game on 
its own terms, less good players get stuck, can't progress, and may stop 
enjoying the game, so providing cheat codes options can allow them to 
get past a sticking point and continue to enjoy the game.

In a single player game, these cheats are ok. Becasue their use isn't 
deletrious to the health of the game environment. -You- are the only one 
in it so maximising -your- fun is the objective.

However in a MMORG -you- are not the center of the universe, and 
pandering to -your- desire to bang out 50 levels in 2 days may not be 
good for the game. This might it less fun for -you-, but is better for 
the -game-.
