Yeah, you can make as many chat windows as you fit on screen...
depends on much of the view you wanna obscure.

You can make one for melee ONLY.. if you so choose.

I have my main chat window and chat 1
On chat one I filtered in melee, spells, others, emotes, skills
Works great.. just leave all the other stuff like guild, tells,
channel , ooc and auctions for the main.
hehe.. I could fit one more screen in there that didn't obscure
anymore, I would make that one for ooc and auctions
