I have done a lot of soloing of darkblue mobs - I spend the 40's in
Katta Graveyard and Tenebrous Mountains and those buggers hit fast. It
helped that I never realy let Defense fall behind much, but it was
nice seeing the extra 2 or 3 ac you get when defense goes up a point.

Also good for raising defense is going out with a Pet class. Since
pets seem to generate little aggro, standing next to one and tanking
means the mob is on me rather than the pet (necro/cleric is good, buff
the pet to the max and look after it well - did the Geonids in CC till
they stopped giving good xp), I get the defense skillups and if I want
to take a break, root the mob and back off.

My play times means that I am on for many short periods rather than
one long stint. This is not grop or raid friendly, so I do a LOT of
soloing. Mid/upper 40's were in katta/TM or Scarlet Desert. Low 50's
were in Dulak at the zone then Boat 1 solo, then the square at the end
of dock 3 for level 53. At 54 I went to the Nadox zone line with the
Fire elementals. A hard fight even with KEI but almost 1% per kill and
there are 3 easily in reach plus more under the lava.

I am currently working on raising Bash when soloing, I find it helps
stop runners as I don't have snare/darkness/ I work 2hb only when I am
in a large group as spare cleric and mana is good. I have a 20 delay
Tae Ew hammer of agression and I usually bum a haste where possible.
Skillups are slow though cos I tend to only be able to melee a few
mobs with the group before healer duties park me on my butt again.
