Agreed. While the "visionary days" had a focus on realism, which is
good in some ways, Verant didn't seem to have a grasp on where the
benefits of realism fell short of making up for the frustrations it
created.

There are times I miss the "quiet time" I had waiting at the dock in
Iceclad, but other times where it was nothing but a source of
annoyance. I can say that my fishing skills have suffered greatly
these days. ;)
