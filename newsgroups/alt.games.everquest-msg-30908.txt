My dwarf Paladin has turned in 8,000 Bone Chips to Trooper
Mozo (2,000 quest completions), and is absolutely maxed with
all Cabilis factions except for the Necros.

And even though my ScaledMystics faction is maxed, I'm still
scowling to them (must be a clash of religions).  I'm also
still scowling to Crusader Quarg, even though I'm Dubious
to all other Crusaders inside Cabilis and Crusader Bodli
out in Field of Bone (Quarg's partner).

Go figure.

So from my own experience, Quarg must be on either ScaledMystics
faction, or the necro faction, since they're the only two I'm
still KoS to.  And I've read on other forums that when people
whose religion doesn't clash with the ScaledMystics as much
as mine does went non-KoS with ScaledMystics, they went
non-KoS to Quarg at the same time.

So it's safe to say that he is on ScaledMystics faction.
Even if he is an SK...
