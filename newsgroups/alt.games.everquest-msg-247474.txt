It certainly made no sense to me. As a monk I'd assumed I'd get money from
begging (it's a legitimate income for a buddhist monk and i assume other
monks in history) and got whacked, and ignored it, until someone suggested
putting it on my hotkey. Hey, maybe it doesn't increase aggro but as a monk
I don't have many other ways and I 2 box with a druid whose nukes can be
distracting! Perhaps it should have been implemented as a no-aggro once a
few hours skill. I'm sure whatever you do with it, it would be abused. I
would have thought a SK would get a skill in extort or something...

Besides, it amuses me to see the occasional skill increase and occasional
copper from an orc hehehe...
