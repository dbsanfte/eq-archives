I read a tip some time back about laying out your computer screen while
playing eq.  There was a command that would in essence shrink your window
(While still in fullscreen mode) and allow you to put your UI into the
remaining "black space".  This would still show you your full view.  IIRC it
worked best for large screens and High res.

I have done some searching, but since I can't recall what the command is, my
searching was very limited and did not produce any results.  I am sure that
I am just not using the correct keyword to search.  It's kinda like looking
in the yellow pages, and trying to figure out what thesaurus the writers
used to create their headings.

Anyway any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
