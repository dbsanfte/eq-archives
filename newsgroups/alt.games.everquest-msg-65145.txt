They guarantee that your characters will be saved for, I believe, 6 
months. However, in reality, they've yet to delete any characters. They 
were going to do a purge of level 1 characters that hadn't been used in 
over a month some time ago, but apparently changed their mind.

Don't worry, your characters will still be there when you come back.
