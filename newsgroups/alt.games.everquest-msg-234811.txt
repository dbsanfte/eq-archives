/agree

Which is why you won't be seeing SoE pressing this issue as a legal
matter anytime soon. 

Several precedents have already been made (Check FindLaw.com for a
couple good ones, or even CNN.com back in 2003 for a chinese story)
that make this a virtual minefield for Sony. 

So keep it in house, and keep better control over it...
