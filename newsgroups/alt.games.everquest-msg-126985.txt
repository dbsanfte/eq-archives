I don't get it either.  The name of the thing is "test".  If something new comes out
there, and you want to test it, this is where you go to test it, no?  Sure, there can
be a community there, but I don't see why they should be upset when people come over
to the test server to test new things.
    FWIW, I do play test once in a while.  I have a very lowbie WE warrior.  This is
just because I get tired playing only one character, and after playing FV, I can't
handle any of the regular servers.  I like that test is so.... peaceful.  I didn't
know that the new interface was coming up when it did, I was just there for some
piece and quite, playing melee for a while instead of priest.  But I didn't complain
when I found out that I had more company than I anticipated.

Annie <--- Wishes she were playing test now, instead of getting ready to go to work.
