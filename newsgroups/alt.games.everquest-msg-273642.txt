I *like* that idea! I've never liked the big auction houses/bazaars of EQ, 
SWG, WoW and EQ2, I always preferred playing in the beta when a crafter had 
to make his own markets based on word of mouth and could rely on the appeal 
of being a convenient, local seller. The inevitable commoditization that 
occurs with big auction houses takes away some of that experience for me and 
the idea of local stalls to support local merchants is very appealing.
