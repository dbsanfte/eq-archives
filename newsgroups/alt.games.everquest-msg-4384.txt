Well, I use the "Make an offer" when I'm willing to go lower than the
average price, but HOPING to get full price. I also use it when I can't get
good pricing information from my sources

i.e. I was selling a Larktwitter Bow, and had seen on Maximum EQ that they
sold for about 200pp, and on EQ Prices that they sold for 900pp. I didn't
want to auction it for 200, if someone was willing to pay 900, but I didn't
want to auction it for 900, and be priced completely out of the market.
Using my "Make an offer" strategy, I sold it for 390.

Later I was selling an EBS - I knew they were priced about 700pp from both
of my main sources, but I was willing to go as low as 200pp if I felt the
buyer was worthy. I actually ended up giving that one away to a guy with a
particularly good story.
