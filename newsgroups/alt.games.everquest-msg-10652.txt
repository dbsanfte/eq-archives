Thanks a bunch for posting that, John. A few of these items really caught my attention.

By the way, the changes to trolls, both in appearance the the now endearing "butt scratch
maneuver" really suck.

So you realize this, but you're going to do it anyway?

Ah. Tip number one. Attack the gromlings. he he

Did anyone really think that was going to change?

By the by..... just for future threads involving "You druids suxx!!"  "We do not! We have it
as hard as you!"  etc. etc. etc. somebody should really preserve this online someplace as a
reference. While probably not the first in history, this is certainly the first time I have
personally seen an admission by a Verant employee that Druids are, in fact, the most
soloable (and thus the most levelable) class in EQ.  I'm kind of shocked he put Shadowknight
second, though.  I would have guessed necro or mage.

I found this outrageously funny for some reason. The fact that the players saw an obstacle
intentionally put in by the designers at the high level end of the game, and still made and
end run around it.  I just find that so cool for some reason.

Believe it or not, I still almost *always* play in the default screen mode. If I'm forced to
go to half screen I won't be happy. I am colorblind in two directions, and I find reading a
lot of things in half screen almost impossible.

Can anybody figure out exactly what this means? Does he mean that from level one on you'll
be able to "peek over" or does he mean that instead of losing the book at level 35 you'll
then only get the "peek over" mode? Either way I see a lot of unhappy casters coming.

Now *this* sounds really interesting!  That just might make me want to hop over and start
some characters on a new server.

Be interesting to see how they explain that one away. He he he.
