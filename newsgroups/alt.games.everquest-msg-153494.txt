Ok...that's about what I mean.

With 13 clerics casting a 10 second spell and various others
sphealing (spam-healing ;-)  ), various all-kinds-of-weird-effects
can happen.  We've noticed a drop off in effectiveness with an
eight member cleric rotation (5 mains, 3 bots...one cleric bots
his wife's cleric ;-)  ), as far as "weird" effects such as abnormal
lag on good connections, mistimed heal effects (tank dies and
is then hit by 3 CHeals, etc).

We normally keep it down to a 6 cleric rotation, with a bot cleric
and a druid/shaman combo as overwatch.  I don't think our MT
on the last two fights ever really got in much trouble (gnomes
tanking the AoW are...um, cute).  We have a smallish guild as
far as numbers go, and have had to adjust tactics accordingly.
NOT slamming anybody elses' way or anything, just don't really
even have the option to zerg even if we wanted to.  I just mainly
wanted to point out the weird effects we've had on major fights
needing a good rotation (first successful ended up with warrior
MT, 2 sk's as backup, and ended up with another warrior defensive
to finish the fight....the CHeal chain didn't work as well as planned,
and aggro control won the day more than anything).  As well
as the possible explanation for some of the effects passed
on by some of our neTechs.
