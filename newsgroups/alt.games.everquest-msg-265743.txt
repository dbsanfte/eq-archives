I came in as a late beta tester, my frustrations are few, and since the last
week or so has gone by all I can say is thank goodness it's not what it was
when I started a month ago, my main just about hit twenty and my others
following closely I came to like the dramatic changes because it's added so
much more content and what I was expecting when I first started beta.

I will be there for launch and now that I've deleted all my EQ1 characters
of 4 yrs., I've got no reason not to be, as EQ2 is my new god game of MMO
choice simply because nothing else can touch it for D&D fun factor.

I'm sick of all the made for PC and console stand alone games which I
usually finish in 40-60 hrs. and have nothing else to look forward to, at
least with Everquest good or bad it never ends and even in hell I'm sure
that's good enough for some players, lol.

Live long and prosper but save some for me :)
