At the tox entrance of erudin there are teliporters, you will find you get get
the angle that you can run off the ledge fall then move forward and teliport
back up to the ledge again.  After your skill is around 80 you wont take any
dammage from the fall, and you can go away from the keyboard with your auto run
on, come back with a skill of 200, in about an hour.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind.
Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
--Thomas Jefferson
