i'm looking for a list that i've seen posted here a few times....can't find
it via googling (need to lvl and put some points into internet-search
skill...thought that might be capped for my race, not sure [my race is
dumerican] =p)

i want the list of raid progressions for 50+ chars

it had the names of all the popular raid-worthy mobs, in their order of
difficulty

but as it was posted on this board, you fine folks added in your own
comments, grouping the raidmobs in certain ways (tunare is about as hard as
soandso, if you can do one, you can get the other with minor changes)

you also made changes to the list; there are different types of difficulty,
and that's what i'm interested in...sometimes brute force will win, other
times it's all about crowd control, and the 'updated' list, assuming it was
saved by someone here, will have that info

thanks in advance
