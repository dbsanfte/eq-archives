And?  Guess what, I'm a bastard.  Get the fuck over it.

The fact that it offends you does not make it a lie.

And yet you still go on this little tangent.  It's like your little refuge. 
You can't face the big bad world or the fact that you were dead wrong about 
the orignal topic, so you've run here.  But you're like a child hiding in 
plain sight, thinking he's invisible.  Your accusation that I lied carries 
no merit or truth.  I'm done with you.  Until you can grow up and actually 
discuss points with something at least approximating rationality, it's not 
worth me throwing away my time.
