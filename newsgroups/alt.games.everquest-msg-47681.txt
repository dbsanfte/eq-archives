Some of the rarer foraged items such as the Rose of Firiona in FV and others
can be sold for decent amounts if someone needs them.  Things like veggies and
berries and stuff, I usually find the heavy traffic area in a zone and give out
"Free meals"  of a half stack of food to players who can't forage or summon
food .   Occasionally, somone will donate a few gold or even plat to you, but
for the most part, you just gain a good reputation and someone may return the
favor one day
