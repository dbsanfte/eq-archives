>but one of our top druids stopped by and saw Zordak,

zordak is located near the lava ledge where u normally fight the FG
king.....nowhere near naggy anymore.

nope a druid cant see naggy from solB entrance even with track maxed, which
is 125 i believe.

zordak and naggy dont have anything to do with each other anymore since
cleric epic got changed and ragefire is located in skyfire.

as far as my information goes: naggy is on a 1 week timer as vox and spawns
within a few hours after a patch. either someone got him before you or he

see him from entrance )
