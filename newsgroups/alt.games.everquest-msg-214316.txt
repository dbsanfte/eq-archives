For some reason the text that appears above characters (their names in
other words) is in an italic font, I have no idea how I did it, but I
want to change it back to the normal, non-italic version.

I have tried doing a complete file check, I have tried deleting my
eqconfig.ini file, I have tried creating a new character, and used the
default UI.

As a last resort I even tried speaking to a GM, his response was "I
didn't know you could do that".

Has anyone else had the same problem? An does anyone know where the
font EQ uses comes from (and what it is).

The font that appears in the scrolly bit at the top of the chat/lobby
is exactly the same font too, and that's also italic, which suggests a
font on my system is missing/corrupt, maybe...
