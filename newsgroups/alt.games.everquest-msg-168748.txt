sigh, another shaman are overpowered thread.

Some clarification:
Yes, shaman of the Kunark/Velios area were best at soloing single big
mobs (Yldema used to be a shaman right of passage, now has probably
been soloed by every class but rogues). Now, with lvl 65, and AA
abilities, even the shaman's position as best soloing class at level
60 has been put to shame.  DC chanters can solo anything that has a
mob of adequate strength next to it, same for druids when there is a
charmable animal around.
That leaves shaman as "overpowered" for raids.
Shaman have awesome mana regeneration abilities - too bad they cannot
use it. There is a reaon most shaman coose high AC/high HP gear over
Wis gear - they are always full mana anyway.  All high damage shaman
spells, espcecially the poison and disease dots, generate enough aggro
to pull any mob of a good MT in the middle of a 10 min fight, if used
to  capacity.  Shaman nukes are comparbly low damage and poor mana
ratio - and limited to cold and poison based, what makes them useless
against any number of high end mobs. Half the time I cast malo,
turgurs and cripple, then spend the rest of the fight reapplying my
epic dot once every 2 min.
Buffs - yes, shaman can add about 600 HP to a level 65 character (if
he hasn't maxed his STA with equipment).  Compare that to the 1500 HP
of a virtue. Stacking of shaman spells, especially the focus line, has
been spotty for the last year, the shaman comunity expects it to
change basically every patch (kinda like bard songs).  The big shaman
attack buff, avatar, can only be cast at 2 characters on a raid (3 min
recast, 6 min duration) and eats emeralds like candy. Spirit of Bih'li
that was mentioned has a minimal ATK component, and is outdoors only.
Shaman AA's have not added any new abilties.  Yes, we can regenerate
even more mana with CanV - see above to the usefullness. Rabid Bear
has been selected "worst class AA" three years running. MGB is nice -
saves some time and reduces our "feel usefull" time to 30 sec.
Shaman are a fun class, due to the high versatility and the large
selection of usefull spells.  But their prime abilities have been made
available to so many classes or put as proc on standard equipment that
thye become less of a necessity in the end game then a lot of people
in their 50s and lower want to believe.
