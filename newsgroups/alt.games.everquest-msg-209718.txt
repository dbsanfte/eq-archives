Rockhoppers in DSP will take you past 50...There are still some blues to me
at 55 I have seen a Ranger hunting till he made 56, solo, wouldn't suggest
that tho' most start turning light blue at 53/54.
Down side to DSP is it's popularity, think of it as the new DreadLands
although, to be far, it isn't really half as bad.

Could solo (or group) OT..Find both OT and DL really boring but they're
there.
Could solo Stonebrunt - Not sure if the Apes and Pandas are classed as
animals tho' but leopards and tigers are plentiful...Not to mention Kobald
camps.
Giants or Kodiaks in Great Divide, often see people after group members
there when I'm killing the Expedition Guards.
Ry'gorr fort in Eastern Wastes, a lot of high level farming gets done there
tho' but it can be a good place to get into a Crystal Caverns group.
