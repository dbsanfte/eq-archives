Ilaare Zemargad - a name that I thought looked kind of like llama + a
surname. . .the desert kingom Lilith is said to rule in fact.  I'm looking
into getting Ilaare's name changed, though, because the I and l are causing
problems selling her wares.  My first choice is Rabiah, after the first
great Islamic woman mystic.

Keiya Waxwings - a name that sounds like a perfectly good battlecry
(KEEEEEIIIIIIYYYAAAAAAA!) + a surname that: a. is a type of interesting
insect, b. is a perfectly good Icarus reference.
