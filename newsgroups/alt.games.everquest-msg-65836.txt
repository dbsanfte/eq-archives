 The name of this group is alt.games.everquest.  NOT alt
.games.Everquest.what darltygerwantstotalkabout.   NOT
alt.games.evrquest.kissverantsass.  and definitely not alt
games,everquest.restrictedposts.  With that said I suggest you get down off
that high horse of yours and put that selfrighteous,Im better than everybody
else attitude in your pipe and smoke it.  Im free to talk about ANYTHINGT I
damn well please as long as its about everquest without havin to think "ooh
is this gonna piss off people who have nothing better to do than whien about
people whining"  Sorry dude youre just not that important. So you better get
that hair growing accross your ass cut. I think its cutting off the air
supply to your brain.  Grow up already and learn that there are other people
in this world beside you.  Maybe youll figure that out by the time you get
out of junior high.  Thank you\
