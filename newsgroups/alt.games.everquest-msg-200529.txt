More to the general area.  Four good named spawn at the base of the pyramid,
one really good semi-named can spawn on the side of it, and a couple spawn
at the top.   Theres also several lesser named running around.

Probably.   I know that the brown lizards are all level 59 - 60.   I didn't
mention them specificly since I'm not sure what level a bard has to be to
get a song capable of mezing them.   I'd hate to say a 60+ bard, and have
the song required turn out to be 64.... ; )
