Well, they use to say DOWN.  I looked at the page and they now say they 
are UP.  Went and wasted my time trying to log in because no, while they 
are up they are not ACCESSIBLE.  Even the chat server says UP.

So the way things are you can tell if a server is DOWN, but there is no 
way to truly know whether you can log in or not.  Crazy.  Things were 
better a year ago.

Just prior to DAOC coming out they took away the capability for the web 
sites to know how many people were online.  Now that they need no longer 
fear DAOC they should reimplement that capability.  They should show how 
many people are on a server and even throw out some more stats like what 
Gods are being killed at the moment, etc.
