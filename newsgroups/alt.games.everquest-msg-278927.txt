You may recall that one of the big complaints about OoW was that we were 
in point of fact reduced to fighting rats and bats AGAIN. Art is 
important. :)

Moreover, we want new arrangements of mobs, new pathing to figure out, 
new static spawns, new groupings, and yes... even new zones.

And while fighting a 50th level rat in OoW is still fighting a rat, at 
least its not a rat in the freeport newbie yard. In some sense you have 
-progressed-.

The sense of progression, the sense of increased power, of 
accomplishment. You go back to the freeport newbie yard and slaugter 
rats with impunity... 

That they aren't still even cons that are "a gamble" is crucial.

True enough, but for most people, that starts making a difference. Which 
is why there were complaints about the rats and bats in OoW.

Lol. :)

Except you actually have to move from TS to Feerott and learn the 
subtleties of feerott. Its not big deal, but you've progressed, you've 
outgrown one and accepted the challenge of the next. It may not seem 
'grandiose' but its surprising important. Players like defeating an 
encounter and moving to the next... defeating the encounter, gaining a 
level and defeating the same encounter that's scaled up one level higher 
has ZERO appeal to practically anybody.

Advancement is important. Remember those old looping arcarde games, with 
1 or if you were lucky 3 levels you just did over and over and over 
again while you watched your score go up until you mistepped and died. 
There is a reason those died out when technology allowed games to be 
more complex.

Once you figure out splitpaw at 20, you can keep coming back until your 
keyboard wears out, and you'll never feel like you've advanced, beyond 
that its dropping level appropriate gear, which it is balanced around 
the assumption you will be wearing it so its relative difficulty stays 
the same. The number next to your character keeps going up, but 
everything else stays the same and you might as well be playing  one of 
those old atari games.

Sure. For a one month event adventure pack, yeah you want a single piece 
of content that gets consumed by the entire playerbase all at once 
regardless of level with minimal coding effort. The problem is that the 
OP wants to see *more* of the game work like this when its ONLY remotely 
appropriate for one-off 'adventures' like this.

As a long term fixture of the game they are the ultimate pointless 
treadmill. They must remain a small part of the game, used very 
sparingly. The odd adventure pack is just fine... but it should never be 
applied to the game as a whole.

The point is scalable content is cool because anyone can play them 
regardless of their level; that makes them ideally suited for "story arc 
event" adventures. The problem is that they'll still be able to play 
them and they'll be exactly the same relatively difficulty forever. The 
solution is remove the forever. They should expire. The event should 
end.

Obviously players might not be thrilled about shelling out for a 
'temporary' zone... but then THAT is exactly the sort of content their 
monthly subscription fees SHOULD be covering. If they want to sell 4 
dollar micro expansions, create the zone and a dozen missions for it 6 
at various level intervals so everyone can do somehting with it out of 
the gate, and 6 at endgame so that high level players can get some fun 
out of it.
