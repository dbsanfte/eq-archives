You miss an important one:
This is Usenet.  Calling people "morons" for really stupid reasons while
hiding behind a really stupid posting name is the norm.

And, well, you're a moron for thinking that Bizbee is any sort of bull...but
you are certainly the end product of Bizbee.  Weird thing about this
group...perhaps it's different than your usual haunts, I don't know...folks
tend to think for themselves here.  If we happen to agree with someone it
MIGHT JUST BE because they're right and you're wrong.
