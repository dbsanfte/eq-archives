/sigh
I apologize for misremembering the name of the L1 Enchanter "come
hither" DD/debuff.  I am deeply humiliated by my faux pas and can
only hope that someday you will be able to find forgiveness in
your heart for me.

I tried that.  After the third death I switched to Tash pulling.
mazingly enough, I didn't die there anymore.

Heh, as I pointed out elsewhere I have my 1337 LoY heal.  :-p
Aside from that tho, I heal a lot more than the Shaman do because,
hmm, because it's expected I guess.  It's just assumed that I'll
have at least enough mana for a Healing Water and a couple roots
and an evac in a pinch (usually in that order too).

Hmmm.  I suppose there are plenty of clueless Paladins out there.
But I know that Kaev was far from unique as a Paladin who always
did his best to look after the Enchanter (especially if there was
no Cleric or the Cleric was not the sort to inspire confidence).

Heh, come try Stromm before it's too late (if it isn't already).
That said, my Druid was in a tankless group in Dulak just the
other day (Cleric, Druid, Magician, 3x Beastlord).

Are you sure that their prior incarnations are cluefull?  :-p

[btw, I didn't see any reason to argue any further over all the
stuff I snipped.  Mostly minor stuff or just differing points-
of-view.  Feel free to claim victory on any of those points that
suit your fancy.  ;) ]
