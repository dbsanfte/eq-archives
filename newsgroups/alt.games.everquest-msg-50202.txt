You know, some people seem to have no problem stealing like that. 
When I first start, my lvl 1 driud was standing at the newbie lift, no
idea what to do.  A higher lvl char walked by, give me a bunch of
stuff, and a shield dropped on the ground.  My husband's char was
standing right there, just have time to say
"you dropped..." before someone picked the shield up.  I mean that was
the first 5 minutes we were in the game.  I was so stunned.
