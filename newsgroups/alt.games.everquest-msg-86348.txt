Orc Pawns have these hatchets.  They are usually found on the pawns that
wander around in the woods near the Orc lift.  They are pretty easy to kill
at about 3rd level and drop hatchets a lot.  You can see them in their
hands, so you can even ignore the ones that don't have them.

You may even have some luck asking for them, because they don't sell for
much and higher level characters that end up with them might pass them on to
you.
