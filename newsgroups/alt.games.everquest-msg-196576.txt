Guys, I may be wrong, but isn't the sitting issue only on pulls?  This may
be confusing some people.  The times I have been on arena raids, we can sit,
but as soon as the puller goes to start the new round of pulls, we have to
stand or the mob comes at the person sitting, and you can definatly tell who
it was cause they get really damaged!=)
