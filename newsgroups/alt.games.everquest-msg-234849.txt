The problem with twisting multiple songs on one hotkey is this:
Once the hotkey macro is started you are "locked" out of the loop. It
must finish before you can do anything different and there no way to
detect a failed song in the macro. If you need to react quickly this
is a horrid idea. get a nostromo if you are looking to make life
easier.
