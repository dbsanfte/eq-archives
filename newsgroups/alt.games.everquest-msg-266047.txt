They are, and they did during Beta.  I for one was very impressed with the 
later patches that dealt with the lag issue.  Early on in the Beta the lag 
was sometimes very very bad, for the last week of it, I hardly noticed any 
at all.  There was some of course, but it really wasn't bad IMO.

And the instancing of all zones was relatively seamless I thought.  The 
issue I had, and it was minor was trying to coordinate a group to enter the 
same zone as the rest of the group. That was a bit of a pain, but not enough 
to counteract the latency gains.

Good job on that SOE.  The other issues, tradeskilling and such, well it 
remains to be seen how that will work out.
