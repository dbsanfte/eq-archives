Solo mobs.  When they get to "RIP" ( that curious Running In Place behavior
that comes when they turn and run away, but being snared, don't move) back off
and plink away till they die.

For best results here, a bow with low damage but short delay is best, and cheap
low damage arrows; the ones from a Tolan's Bracer would be great, or a mage
buddy soloing nearby and willing to indulge you in continous supply, otherwise,
well just make cheap arrows for yourself or get really lazy and buy those
absolutely miserable ones vendors sell (saves all that clicking from making
trivial fletching items)

I even went so far as to deliberately pause and bandage myself up some while
finishing a mob off, in order to let him heal up a bit.

I also found that some mobs, at least, run only so far away and then stop,
therefore I was able to do this trick with my warrior (who has no snare
proccing weapon) in LOIO on running sarnaks and goblins down by the lake shore.

Your bow and arrows don't matter as far as skilling up, the reason I suggest
low delay is just because taking a hundred shots in 10 minutes isn't going to
be as many skill ups as taking two hundred in the same time.
