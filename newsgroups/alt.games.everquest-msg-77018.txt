Be aware of where she spawns, though. Looking at the level of your
characters (and races) it might be a concern. I see her all the time,
and she stands right in between two of the Bashers. They might not be
the most uber critters in the game, but as newbie guards go, they will
flatten a 38th level Dwarf into swamp stew pretty efficiently.
