Sorry, I assumed thread drift. While I do have strong opinions on the 
matter, I don't think I equated religious faith with anything in my post... 
I was, in fact, very matter-of-factly. I do believe that a majority of 
parents who would choose home schooling would do so in order to prevent 
their children being exposed to ideas that run contrary to their 
religious beliefs, rather than because they consider themselves more 
academically suited for the task than professional teachers.

The problem is that, while the state of the educational system is an 
issue that's open for all to see, judge and have an opinion on, "Home 
Schooling" means nothing, if you don't know who's doing the schooling. 
My view, as stated in the previous post, is that it's better to have a 
maybe sub-optimal but egalitarian system, rather than risking a large 
number of children growing up believing in, say, a flat Earth, the 
Jewish blood libel, or that any races are superior to any others, 
without an authority figure ever challenging those beliefs. That, to me, 
is tantamount to child abuse.
