-Follow-up Post-

Out of curiosity, I've taken a look at your other posts in
alt.hi-po.big-block-ford-mercury and rec.audio.car.  In those posts
you seem to have a better grasp of the English and typing skills than
what you've shown here.  So either you are not the James K. that made
those other posts, or you purposely are typing abusing those skills here.
You could be Robin K. I suppose.  And I guess it's possible that
you are both not related and that there is indeed two IRONCOW's
in the alt.hi-po.big-block-ford-mercury.

robink@castle.on.ca
james010@aztec-net.com

Anyway, if you are two people, I suspect the other might be upset
by your posting style.  If your one person, It's odd that your
communication skills take a vacation when you post here.
