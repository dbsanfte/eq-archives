Using Leather Padding as the example for this, it trivials at 31.

At skill level 31 your failure rate is 34% overall.
It goes down 1% per skill level, until you hit 5% failure rate at a skill 
level of 60.

So, when leather padding goes trivial, and I get no more skill increases 
from making it, my expected failure rate is 34%.  Not a streak of bad 
luck.

The same holds true for any of the items that trivial below 68, when they 
go trivial, your expected failure rate will be 34%, reducing by 1% per 
skill level above trivial until it hits 5%.  When it becomes massively 
trivial (200 over trivial I think), then your failure rate goes down 
again, below 5%.

For items that trivial higher than 67, it's not until you hit a trivial 
level of 172 that when an item trivials, it's failure rate is 5%, or the 
minimum failure rate.  For an item that trivials at 100, your expected 
failure rate is 23% when your skill level is 100 for example.  An item 
that trivials at 68 has a failure rate of 31% when your skill is 68.
