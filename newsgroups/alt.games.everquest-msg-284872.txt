I would think you are right.  Sure is nice to be able to cast Invis
when you get the warning it is fading.  Mine always faded when I was
in a dicey situation  -  I swear I could dawdle along in PoK, or
Bazaar and the Invis would last the full time.  Any other zone, as
soon as I see a hostile within 30 feet, the bloody thing always
decided to fade on me, lol.
