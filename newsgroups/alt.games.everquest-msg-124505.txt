  My wife and I live next door to the owners of an orange cat named Bill. 
The other night, we were leaving our place and looked over to see one of 
our cats lying directly in front of our neighbor's door.
  Before I realized what I was saying, I said "Look--he's camping Bill!"

"I'm sorry, did I offend you just now? Pardon me--I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Really, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
