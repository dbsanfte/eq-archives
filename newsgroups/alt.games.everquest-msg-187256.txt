Lowest semi-safe solo of any class in the planes would probably be a 50-51
Bard. Would guess a C3'd druid sometime around 54 or so.  Wiz and Necro
potentially around that time too. Can't see most other classes (including
shammy) solo'ing in the planes at all, but experts in other classes may
disagree. All of these would be doing VERY specific mobs in very specific
places. Obviously, the choices of mobs and places goes up some as you level.
