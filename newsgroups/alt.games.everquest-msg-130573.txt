1) I posted a log because her reply amused me.  I need a necro to bind.  
Ooookay.

2) Some people laughed. Others got after me for 'nagging' her about a 
bind.

3) I *am* a woman.  And I don't give a bloody damn what you think of my 
calling her that.  It's an expression that's common around where I'm 
from, and carries none of the negative connotations you seem determined 
to add to it.
