Because the standard response to "ah, sure, KEI lasts several
hours, why should I bring a chanter" is "what if its dispelled?"

When you are 65 and wandering deep into a dungeon, 100pp is chump
change compared to losing KEI and having to either strain along
at half mana regen or get out and get another and then fight all
the way back in.

People happily pay 100pp for a rez, which takes far less effort
than KEI.  People happily pay 100pp for a 10 shot SOW potion when
you can easily get SOW for 1pp in POK (if you even have to pay
that much).  What people are willing to pay has to do with what
their time is worth, not with what the time of the supplier is
worth.  

For that matter, spend any time in POK these days and I'm pretty
sure you'll hear someone saying "paying 100pp for a KEI", because
the KEI streetcorner trade is a lot less active than it once
was.  If you could buy up a bunch of KEI's at 100pp each and
stuff the bank vault with them, you'd only have to "camp KEI"
once a week instead of every couple hours (not counting deaths)
