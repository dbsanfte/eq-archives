With a bard playing mana song, I can kill Sentients in WL pretty much
non-stop.  With KEI, I would rock.

Ok.  Let's see.  Just at level 53, a druid can cast Winged Death (1287
dam, 350 mana), Breath of Ro (920 dam, 250 mana), Drifting Death (650
dam, 200 mana), and Immolate (240 dam, 120 mana).  That's a grand
total of 3097 damage for 1020 mana.  In one minute.  With a 3 damage
to mana effiency.  Not necros level of bad-ass-ness, but still pretty
goddamned respectable.

If you REALLY want effiency, just use Breath of Ro and Winged Death.
2107 damage for 600 mana.  3.5 damage to mana effiency.  And 600 mana
is less that two bubs of mana for my half elf, only has 184 wis driud.

Of course that's also not taking into account 160 points of damage
from our root.  

Or a druids ability to travel.

Or a druids buffing ability.

Or the fact that druids are the second best nukers in the game.

Or, to bring things full circle, druids very respectable healing
abilities.

Great.  Monks solo great.  Whoopy.  But their hunting grounds are MUCH
more limited than druids.  I think I have yet to see a monk, at level
52, solo things like giants in WL or Kael.  Or Sentients in WL.  Or
quad wyverns in CS.  Or quad hoppers in DS (I've done it once.  Took
some time).  Or quad hill giants.  And I've done all of this with out
taking one point of damage.

Yeah.  I can see how druids are in need of an upgrade.
