Some minor flaws in this thinking though...  Clerics CAN'T Snare/SoW...  In
fact...  I don't think SHAMANS can snare.  Mages...  Don't snare...
Enchanters don't snare either...  Clerics and Enchanters do Root.
Enchanters use slow to make the mobs hit at a slower rate, but it doesn't,
as far as I can tell, make them walk any slower.

Enchanters can literally charm anything...  Druids... can only charm
animals for the most part, plants when they are higher.

Mages have pets...  Druids don't have a pet until maybe 55th level.
Charming an Animal doesn't count as a pet, because pets don't attack you
once your spell finishes out.  Mages also Damage Shield, dunnot about
shamans having Damage shields.  I'm fairly sure Mages don't Root, they have
a pet that does it for them.

Shamans have better DoTs and at 35, have a spirit wolf to summon up.  I
have seen Shamans solo IGs faster than I can who con BLUE to me at 51.

Wizards have an AE Snare, while it isn't great, they also nuke a heck of a
lot more than Druids do, and do quad kiting SOONER than Druids do.

As for melee...  After getting to Level 35, I gave up using melee straight
out, mostly cause getting slapped around hard, even with a DS x2 on and
having what best weapon I could for melee up, I would die quicker than just
doing the snare/root/dotx2 routine.  Currently 52 and still use that, not
wanting to do quad kiting, cause you can't do that with IGs and it is mana
inefficient. (IGs are nice sometimes when you get the double digit pp
drops)
