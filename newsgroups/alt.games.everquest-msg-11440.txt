Okay - here we go. My own personal belief is that bad behaviour can be
planned for and designed around. Some people will always choose to follow
the path of least resistance, so the trick is to design a game that
penalises jerk behaviour and definately not reward it in any way. Others
just like being assholes, well fine, but make them play at a  major penalty.

For instance (hypothetically):

We have a fine thing called faction in this game - it is just such a dang
shame it is based on what NPC's think of you, and not what the PC's do.
Imagine if you could "/asshole %t" someone or "/saint %t" them. This is then
used to work out your faction with various playable race cities. You start
out KOS with all player race cities but your own, so only way to improve
faction at another player race city is to be nice to the actual PC's of that
race. Rewarding good behaviour, penalising jerks, it's the old "carrot" and
"stick" principul at its simplest

If you are a total asswipe then in short order you will be KOS in every city
including your own starting city and staring at the character generation
screen thinking of a better approach to use next time.

This is just one (obviously flawed) example of empowering players to be self
policing. Given time and brainpower a Developer could easily design a viable
system on the same "player policing" principul.

Now - when someone says "Who is screwing up Norrath" and I answer "The
designers", I hope you better understand what angle I am coming from - not
just the simplistic "I am the customer so it must be verant's fault".
