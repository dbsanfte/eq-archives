Yes they summon, they don't cast.  They melee for over 250 and hurt like
hell.

Some are hidden in the water.. I went there last night for the first time..
single pulled a mob (fought it for a while to make sure it *was* solo) then
when i crossed the water to get to the rock my group was at (well, me
running 3 chars and a friend running 2),  3 mobs hidden under the water
added.

They kicked the crap out of us inside 10seconds or so...  not sure of level
(all 3 of my chars were 60 - and they con blue)  assuming slowable, they are
a tough (if not rewarding) challenge.. if not, they are just monsters

They are lil black sperms,  black ravengers is their name
