I think Biz knew what was meant by it he was questioning the choice of
phrase.
It sounds like one of the phone calls I get at work when someones upped the
resolution on the display settings and the next user (normally female and
often blonde but hey, I work in Essex) will say something like "The thingies
on my computer have got all tiny" Feel free to replace "tiny" with "ickle"
depending on how much the said female wants to play on the "I can't do it
I'm just a helpless girl/woman" routine.

If you question a beastlord on why his warder is so small he'll nearly
always blame the cold weather, unless their female then they just add "but
it's perfectly formed"
;ï¿½)
