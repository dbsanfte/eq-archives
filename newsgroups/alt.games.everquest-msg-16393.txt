I've read several discussions on this topic and looked for somebody to post a
link to some sort of VI statement/verification regarding this, and not seen it.
I'd say the jury is still out, but it's possible that you *might* get a
marginally higher degree of taunt by begging an NPC during battle.  But good
lord, you're a monk! Why in the hell are you wanting to taunt? Don't you get the
crap beaten out of you enough as it is?
