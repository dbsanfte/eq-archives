  I can see his point, though.  Mana dumping means you're just "giving
your mana to someone more useful"... which some might argue isn't a
substitute for being having something "useful" to do with their mana
on their own.

  The way I see it though, mana dumping is more flexible.  You have
more choice about how that mana can be used, because you can give it
to anybody who has a special use for that mana.  You can give it to a
cleric for healing or a wizard who's nuking.  That indirectly means
that YOUR mana can be responsible for a 4000 point DB nuke or a big,
crucial heal.  A non mana-dumper's mana can only do what THEIR spells
can do.  A mana dumper can make their spells do what ANYBODY's spells
can do.  It may not be glamorous, but it's pretty powerful.
