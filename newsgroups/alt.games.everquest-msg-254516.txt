Yeah, low-level LDoN (which is all I've been able to do so far) aren't
great for adventure points, but the XP and loot seem okay and they do
have the advantage of having a known cap on time investment, so they're
great for people with only a couple hours to play.  (Given your recent
post about a several-hour stint in Mistmoore, I gather that's not your
style. :-)

Ah, I've yet to win an augment, so I haven't looked at them much.  Good
to know they inherit the level restriction of the item they're on.  (As
someone else noted, at least now you can remove it and put it on something
else.)
