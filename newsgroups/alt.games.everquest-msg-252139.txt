I don't think my fisher/baker (16 vah shir rogue) would live long in
natimbi. My 58 druid was nearly killed on zone in. I checked all the posts
on the net and the developers promised it was fixed last year, so I'm glad
it's supposedly working on Test. Maybe next patch it will work and people
will, once again, use AS. As it stands my rogue, with 90 wisdom, has made
patty melts to 191 with hardly anyone else there the whole time.

I bought a spell of a vendor and thought i'd use it for another of my
characters, so chucked it on my mule. I'd priced it outrageously so it would
be there when i relogged but someone had bought it anyway so I now have a
rogue with 170 wisdom. He doesn't have a lot of combat ability in wisdom
gear however.

Abysmal sea... such a massive, empty place. It's just a waste.

Cnas, 16 Rogue, baker and gourmand, patty melts delivered to your door!
