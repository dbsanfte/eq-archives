Ok, maybe I didn't come across right. So I try to clarify something
here. I did notice some weird order on your posts so I just asked
whether I was the only one. After all it could be MY newsreader.

But seemingly it wasn't. I don't want to offend you. So either you could
"try" to adapt to the way usenet works or be ignored. If you keep up
your attitude that you are against the rest of us then sorry. Must be
very funny talking with never getting a reply but it's your call.
