I went to Jaggedpine for cheese and fell in the river too.  I was busy 
looking at the map at the time since I'd never been there before and didn't 
realise the danger.

If it's on Bertox send me a tell and I'll help.  Otherwise, your enduring 
breath idea is good, and there is usually someone in the zone of a high 
level brewing jumjum beer so you could try just asking for help.

I am betting that you were walking through the tunnels towards the portal
and you fell off the final bridge just before the portal.  It's a long swim
north and east from there to a ledge where you can escape.

I'd try EB and make a hotkey for /corpse, dive off that bridge, swim north
and mash the key until you get the corpse.

As the other poster stated, try and get a rez after you've recovered the 
corpse.
