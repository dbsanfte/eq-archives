We did an adventure last night with a troll warrior who was the group leader. 
When we got back to camp and split loot the druid and a warrior had to leave. 
The rogue went AFK to start some laundry.  I was /ooc and /lfg to try and find
our replacements.  The troll suddenly announced, "this is taking too long.  I'm
going to find a different group".  And disbanded our group - leaving the
chanter and me standing there.  We joined up.  
Within a couple minutes I'd found a SK, paladin and druid.  The rogue returned
and sent me a tell just as everyone was showing up.  The whole time the troll
is sitting there with his LFG sign on.  
The jerk actually had the nerve to send me a tell, "oh, I see people showing
up.  Are we ready to go?"  I was tempted to say something rude but instead just
sent him a short tell:  "sorry, group full."
I got a really cheap thrill out of that. :)

For all my whining, I'm really enjoying LDoN and getting some nice loot for a
level 35 cleric :)  The "idiots" are outnumbered by really nice people about 5
to 1, in my experience.  As a matter of fact, for the first time I'm thinking
about calling in sick so I can play :)
