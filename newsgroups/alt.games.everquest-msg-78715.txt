 Yeah and the tunnel leading to Elder area. You can pull that to the
water by Eye and not really have to worry about adds, although I think
they are possible there. 

 As to solo camp effectively? No, not really effectively in my opinion.
Maybe Elder as well if you can avoid the roamer. Without something like
a fungi, it wont be very effective. Get a group. Or at least a healer.
