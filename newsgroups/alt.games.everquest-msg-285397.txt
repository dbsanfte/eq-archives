Thanks for the feedback, but let me clear up a few things.

PC is crap.  I hate that place. No fun whatsoever.  Insane XP but zero
fun.
Ramp in OT is a little better.  When the dragoons come a-callin that
will get your blood pumpin for sure.
KT is pretty good but we mowed through that place in our early teens.
6 necro's in KT will do that.

The problem is most of the people "these days" recommend places with
high XP values, not necessarily what's fun.

For instance, Befallen was fun in the high singles to low teens.  By
mid-teens it's not much of a challenge for a group of 6 necro's.

Thanks.

~F
