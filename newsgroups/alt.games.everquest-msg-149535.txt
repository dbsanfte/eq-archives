Hey!  My 25 Druid just upgraded to a Serp Bracer.  Extended Affliction
is a wonderful thing!  Or are you still talking about monkees?  :-p

I'm curious about H2H weapons.  There's a 7/19 H2H with some stats
(I don't recall them off-hand) that drops in JP.  I'm wondering how
this compares with other stuff, and for that matter how good it is
in general.  I got one hunting there, put it on my bazaar trader for
250pp (or maybe it was 200, heh, not sure) and it sold quite quickly.
