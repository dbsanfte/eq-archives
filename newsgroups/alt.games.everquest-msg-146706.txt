Thanks to everyone for their comments and suggestions.

A guildie was kind enough to point out the Scimitar of the
Leafrunner quest to me.  This weapon seems ideal since you've
talked me into keeping an open mind on my epic, and also,
because I don't want a weapon that's too uber.

So now I'm busy improving my 1HS skill after all.  I may
try to keep my 1HB skill up, too, but it seems like it'll
be difficult to keep both maxed as my level progresses.

I should point out that I know Druids aren't really a melee
class.  My real underlying motivation is to keep my Defense
maxed.  I know too many casters and priests that have
absurdly low Defense skills.  It seems a worthy goal to take
a few on the chin now, in order to improve my Defense, and
hopefully not take it on the chin later, when myself or my
group are in a life-and-death situation.

Also, sometimes melee is good for getting that last bit of
health out of the mob, if you're OOM.  So I wouldn't mind
keeping my 1HB and 1HS skills maxed, if possible, even though
druids aren't really meant for melee, at least not later in
life.  We'll see how reasonable my goals are as I progress,
I guess.

I only have one more question (if anyone is still listening,
heh).  Do you need to put a point into the Channeling skill
to get it to rise?  How about Dodge?  I assume not, but...

Thanks,
Ed
