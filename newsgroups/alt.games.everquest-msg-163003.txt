	I'd say the only thing you've shot is your own foot, at this point.

	Archery isn't better than melee because for the vast majority of Rangers
it deals less DPS than melee.  A Ranger needs 45 AA points and a very good bow
before he can even think of using Archery as a primary form of combat, and
most will never have those things.  Those who do can, if they persist,
eventually get melee weapons that will outdamage their bows.

	The fact that the Ranger isn't getting hit is meaningless.  Since we don't
tank, we don't get hit when we melee, either.
