 While it may be just a bug I don't really seem many people taking
advantage of it. When it was just Kunark, this was a nifty timesaver.
However, with the insertion of Velious and Luclin, the Nexus/Bazaar is
probably a better bind spot. I suppose for lower level characters who
don't really have a need to go to Velious or Luclin at this time would
probably benefit from it.
