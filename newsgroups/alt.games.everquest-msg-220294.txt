I think he was trying to say the first one, but it's mostly incorrect....
At 138 disarm traps (not much higher than the bard cap) I have less than a 5
percent actual failure rate at disarming normal traps.  The other 19 of 20
times, I succeed easily.



And before anyone says it... yeah yeah... I'm catching her skill up to her.
I hadn't finished working disarm traps before I retired the game, and by the
time I came back they had removed the one trap in Sol A that raised it at a
reasonable rate.    Pointless button mashing is the only way left to raise
it, and pointless button mashing sucks.
