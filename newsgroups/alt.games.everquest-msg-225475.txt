I wonder if your EQ sessions are simply longer than other games, letting 
heat build up a little longer, gradually raising the temperature farther....

I mean I know lots of people who will be logged into EQ for 8 hours at a 
stretch... but few that play other titles for more than 1 or 2.

Just thinking out loud... EQ might be a bigger strain than I gave it 
credit for, but I've checked my task manager when EQ is in a window and 
its not pushing anywhere near 100% utilization.
