They're not just on the floor, they're on the walls and
ceilings as well.

And I don't know how anyone could miss them, they're the
big pulsating plants that wave their tentacles around.

And they don't "see through invis", exactly, they simply
work by touch -- if you brush against one of their tentacles
(be careful when they stretch out far, as they do at times),
they can feel you and sting you that way.

As for "don't walk in the middle of the cave", that's
bad advice given the fact that some of them are on the
WALLS of the cave.  Instead, just keep your eyes open
for each tentacle plant, and walk wide around it,
wherever it may be.
