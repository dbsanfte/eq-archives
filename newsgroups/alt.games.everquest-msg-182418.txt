If KEI were a single target spell it wouldn't be able to be casted on a lvl
1 character.
SoE can be casted on a lvl 1 char but it would have the be the group
version,
Flight of Eagles.  The same goes for my focus, I can cast group focus on
anybody
but the single target will not stick on lower lvls.
