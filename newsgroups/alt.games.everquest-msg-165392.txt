Okies.

Thanks for all the responses.

Last night I went and picked her up a set of Tizmak leggings. I passed them
over, she put them on - nothing.

So, I went with my gut, shut down my session, and edited the ini file to use
the VeliousArmorWithLuclin option - bammo, instant purple leggings.

Her tail end is now covered, though it's worth noting that it appears that
the leggings are painted on at this point - tight, tight pants. lol.

Those are some seriously sex starved boys at SOE.
