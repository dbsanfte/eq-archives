    All very true, but that doesn't really answer hs question.  Yes, red names
on a blue server are pretty useless, but then, in and of themselves they are
fairly harmless unless you have the misfortune of finding one in a group you are
in.  But why do they generate such hate from people who will probably never be
in a position to group with them in the first place?

    I would have to say it is probably because the red haters may have spent
time in a PK environment, either on a Zek server in Everquest or some other
game, and learned how irritating PC hunters can really be.  Even though you
can't really touch them, the fact that you flaunt that you  join their ranks
makes you hated.

Or not.. I dunno.
