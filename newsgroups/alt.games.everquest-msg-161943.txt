I found a bug..

Died, and had to log out without the corpse run.

5 days business trip, so I installed and used EQIM liberally while away.

Return: no corpse in this zone.

It seems that EQIM time counts as logged in time for corpse decay.

I did log in to EQIM as that character, as it is my main.

No answer to /petition yet, but I have not had time to spend hours in
game to await a reply.

/sigh
