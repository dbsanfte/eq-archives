Have you tried Korean fare?  It's hard for gyoza to stand up to mondu.  As
for sushi, as much as I love it, too much makes my tummy hurt, so kim bab
makes a much better alternative.  With the main entrees, I'm afraid Korean
food wins out again.  Hell, Korean style barbeque (boolgolgi) is pretty
popular in Japan as well.  Granted, I'm always up for shabu shabu when we go
to a japanese restaurant, but I'd much rather be eating Jya ja myung.

And then, there's kimchee.....
