Another thing is that since bards play songs without having to worry about their
movement, they would go from the most difficult class to BOT to the easiest; you
could literally leave them twisting cantata/DS/Haste/Stackable Haste
continuously, on autofollow, and your only worry would be making sure they
didn't get stuck on a corner or something as you move around.  BOT computer in
another room in the house?  No problem, because you never need to change what
they are doing anyway!  While a real bard would be better still, since they'd be
able to respond flexibly to situations as they develop, the large number of
people with BOT clerics tell me that if you have a second account, having a
character on it thats at 2/3rds max effect is perfectly acceptable, still -much-
better than soloing.
