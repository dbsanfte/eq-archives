Slightly off topic, but I run EQ and download web pages at the same
time, over a 56K connection.  DL'ing pages doesnt slow down play too
much, unless in a battle.
I can do it because I have 2 pcs networked.
I run a VSOCKS proxy on the machine I connect to the internet on (and
play EQ on).  The other machine is configured to use the connected
machine as a socks server.
Badda bing I can do price checks, quest and map lookups while playing.
Very handy sometimes :)
