Sounds like druid is precisely what you want. Necros take a bit more
attention. It's almost impossible to kill a soloing druid in outdoor
zones, and you kill without doing much of anything.. ensnare, root,
dot or two, sit, refresh as necessary at lower levels, or four
ensnares, run around a bit, then a bunch of casts of an area effect
spell until they all fall over dead at medium levels. Then you can
worry about the more complex fighting at higher levels when you get
there.
