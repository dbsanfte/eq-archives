Not sure why you'd want to visit this guy, given that as far as anyone can
tell he's KoS to everybody, sees invis and hide/sneak, as well as kicks the
ass of every uberguild that's tried to take him on.

Oh, and from what I've heard, theres a portal somewhere in Sanctus Seru that
has a level limit on it that takes you to his chamber.
