I really am sorry Lokari.  I apologize for whatever I did to offend you.  My
only intention was to meet some more people that played on Prexus and
perhaps share something in common with them.  Here are the rules for naming
your characters.  Ignorance is not an excuse.
  1.. Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words,
anatomical references, racial slurs, and homonyms of these words.
  2.. Combinations of words that produce an offensive result (e.g. Hugeaz,
Tug Mcgroin).
  3.. Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g.
Jesus, Allah, Satan, Stalin).
  4.. Copyrighted or trademarked names of products, characters, services, or
concepts (e.g. Drizzt, Marlboro, Sony).
  5.. Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can be
either fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g. Garth
Brooks, Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan).
  6.. Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time
setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Cannabis, Sloegin,
Anyone). This includes references to drug substances or drug related
paraphernalia.
  7.. Proper names from EverQuest (e.g. Rathe, Karana). This also includes
the first or last name of any significant EverQuest NPC (e.g. Dorn, Trumpy,
Karn).
  8.. The names of senior Customer Support Representatives or employees of
SOE or Sony Entertainment (e.g. Absor, Abashi, Aradune)
  9.. Names chosen with the intent or possessed with the effect of harming
the reputation of a player or Customer Service Representative.
  10.. Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to:
The, Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon,
Lordeagle, Mothermaggy, Darksister).
  11.. Names that contain sentences (Ikillorcs), phrases (Ontop), or two or
more words that do not form descriptive compound words (Petcarbob, Diediedie
and Tablechair). Descriptive compound words are allowed in first names and
are encouraged in surnames (e.g. Treehugger, Giantslayer). Descriptive
compound words (each separate part of the word and the entire word) must
otherwise adhere to all other naming rules.
  12.. Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from popular
existing media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgarath, Tanis).
  13.. Names where the combination of the first and last name form a phrase
or violate a previous rule (e.g. Crymea River, Bran Muffin, Story Thyme)
