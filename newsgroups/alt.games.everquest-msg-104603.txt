Actually I play ok with a tnt 16 meg agp, with all luclin models and
animations on. Having textures higher than LOW is the memory hog. I'd
rather have them on LOW and get the full effect (plus I can't really
notice a difference.) I do have 576 meg of ram though.

What is an "8megor 16 meg video card"? Is 8megor the brand? Confused.
