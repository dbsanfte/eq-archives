Could some kind person please explain the AA "stuff" to me.
What little I know about it is there is a window I can bring
up, with all my skills on it. I suspect that it is an alternate
to going to a "teacher" to upgrade skills, but am in no way
sure of that. What is it for sure? How do I use it? SHOULD
I be using it? Why would I WANT to use it? Etc. etc. etc.
(the whole skinny please).
