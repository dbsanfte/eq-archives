Depends on what you are playing it for, isn't it :)  While you claim I am
making such an effort to defend myself, I need to ask why it is so important
to you to drag me down to your level?  People ebay all the time, I don't see
how any person has the right to pass judgement.   What you are doing is
called slander.  You do not know me, but you are tarnishing my name /
reputation.  Whether or not I voilate the EULA does not make me the bad
person you are making me out to be.
