Don't worry, George W. Bush will continue drastically reducing taxes
on millionaires and billionaires, and as a result, <wave arms
frantically and jump up and down), thus enriching Joe Middleclass!

Yes, George W. Bush is talking about more tax cuts.  *sigh*  He reels
in more suckers with those tax-cuts-that-aren't-really-tax-cuts-
because-we're-running-a-deficit...  *double sigh*
