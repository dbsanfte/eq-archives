what's with all these wierd ("cross")posts? is there a way to just ignore
them, like a feature i don't know about?

i don't seem to recall this many coming in a few days, as compared to maybe
a month ago

aright, and these wierd acronyms . . AFAIK = as far as i __________ ?? why
can't it be 'kanrecall' - its not AFAICR though . . . school me!

what's the K ?

most of the rest i can figure out, but isn't there some kind of manual for
this type of thing?

doesn't think there's anything wrong with posts that are external views of
eq, like how to cheat, sell an account, or why people bother to play . . .
// dun wanna get flamed for posting honestly
