You missed the point.  When there were a couple of Bards out there all
you achieved by killing PHs was increase their take.  They didn't "have
time" to kill PHs, what with always maintaining a minimum of 4 HGs in
train.  There weren't too many of them who did it, most  folks who have
played a Bard to the point where they can solo-kite multiple HGs with
ease have better things to do with their time than pharm HGs (I've
never seen many Bards over 35 or so on Tunare, those that keep playing
have little trouble getting groups for xp and getting into raiding
guilds for gear as far as I can tell).
