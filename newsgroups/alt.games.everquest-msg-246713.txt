OK then... so what have you proved? That ati makes a better card? Or 
that nvidia has/had more market share? Or that nvidia has been the 
extreme gamer's card of choice for longer... I mean really...until 
fairly recently it was 3dfx vs nvidia... ati was what your mom's budget 
dell had in it -- it was not a serious choice for gamers) so the 
internet has archived a longer history discussion (and problems) with 
nvidia.

By even associating yourself with such poor research methodology as an 
unqualified google search you lose credibility. I hate to say it, but 
you are starting to sound like an ATI shill/fanboi.

Now myself, I never cared for 3dfx on philisophical grounds in terms of 
what they did in terms of the 3dfx api's, so i preferred nvidia during 
that era, even before nvidia finally toasted them in performance. But 
I'm not some sort of nvidia zealot. I freely recognize that ati has the 
best cards out today, and would honestly recommend that someone buying a 
new card take a good look at ati. Hell, as a Canadian, I'm pleased ati 
has done so well.

That said, historically, ati, in its rush to topple nvidia, has been 
plagued with driver issues in a multitude of games. They have only just 
recently realized satisfactory driver acceptance. Further, historically 
ati has a dismal record as an ideal platform for everquest. Of course 
the landscape today that has changed, as ati has caught up and even 
exceeded nvidia, but I am sincerely hesitant to recommend that someone 
who is primarily interested in EQ move to ati from a reasonably modern 
nvidia without very good reasons.

Nvidia and EQ have worked very well together for a *long* time, and I 
expect most problems to be temporary.

As a result of this history I would be unsurprised to see a large 
percentage of eq players are running nvidia chipsets (larger than the 
overall market share numbers would indicate). Its a ludicrous fantasy to 
suggest that SOE is suddenly going to suddenly drop support for everyone 
who isn't running a modern ati or brand new nvidia 6500 with their 
directx 9 updates.

That is misinformation at best, and deliberate ati shilling at worst.
