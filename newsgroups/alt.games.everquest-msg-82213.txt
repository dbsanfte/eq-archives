Fair enough, but i always figured Barons to be mean evil characters - the
only one i can think of off hand is the Baron in Dune, in the film he was a
right bastard, ripping peoples hearts out and having his pustules lanced all
the time....Now thats a Baron a Troll can be proud of :)


Naddo...Not a Troll...and sure as hell not a Baron :(
