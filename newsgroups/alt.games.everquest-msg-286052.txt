Hi Biz - nice to see you -  I always enjoyed your posts!  :)    Aye,
as you say, times move on...  

As Richard says, the community sure has dwindled  :(  I really don't
think the cause is people moving away from Usenet, either, so much as
EQ is pared down to the hard-core (and sometimes paranoid, heh)
remnants of it's once huge player base.  Hopefully, I would think that
with the Newsgroups accessible from Google now, that Usenet might be
enjoying a slight growth.  Or at least I hope so. 

I virtually never play EQ now, as, rather like this group in a way,
it's just too empty of players.  Entire zones are ghost towns, which
doesn't encourage new blood.  I'll give it a bit longer, but I see
that day coming when I'll be cancelling the subscription, which makes
me sad after almost 6 years, sigh.

Come on, Sony, get your fingers out!!
