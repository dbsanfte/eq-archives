Back in 88-89, I spec'd two machines with that exact same specifications
from one of the first custom builders in the state.   Those and a HP
laserjet series two came to $9500.00 which was a bargin at the time.
They were the first 20mhz 386's in the State at the time.   Oh the power!.
A year later, we had 4 of them and went and upgraded the memory from 2mb to
8mb! for about $2400.00.  I remember a few years later, finally becoming
brave enough to throw the old 2mb modules away because they were not
compatible with anything anymore... sigh.

One thing of note, in about 1994, I finally dug those 386's out of the
office basement and threw them away.   Before I did, I tore one apart and
was surprised at how well they were built compared to current models.
Machined housings instead of stamped, perfectly aligned screws, heavy duty
power supplies.   Sigh, the memories.

Thanks pal,
