In UO, most crafting came at the expense of 'adventuring ability' as
well.  Lumberjacking was an exception, because of the synergy boosts
it gave to Axe-monkeys; I think Scribing offered certain benefits to
Mage types as well.

But the UO crafting system was appealing enough to attract both the
folks who sincerely wanted to play noncombatant characters and the
combat-monkeys who wanted the benefits that could only come from
crafters.  Especially melee-types who couldn't solo the top-end
cashfarms the way Bards, Tamers and some mages could - a good
craftmule could make money almost as fast, with less risk and the side
effect of providing your 'mains' with quality gear.
