I'm looking for a new robe for my LV18 (almost 19) DE Necro.  I need higher
AC for when I take the hits from mobs.  Also some other nice stats would be
nice.  "Izibat" the gnome in the casters area of Shadowhaven sells robes and
cloaks (4 of each).  I've considered buying one of each on them, but first
though I'd see if anyone else has better ideas.  I AM NOT a twink and CAN
NOT twink myself, so everything has to be VERY affordable.  I'd prefer not
to spend more than 350-400 pp TOTAL.  Here is part of my log file giving the
item name, cost, and stats of each.  I'm wearing a "Gray Sr Apprentice
Robe", magic lore item, AC6, mana+1, and a cloth cape, AC2.
