Damage shields are of such a short duration they are a rare buff to have. 
Aego lasts hours, so does KEI, but your DS is a valuable addition. In fact, 
if the tanks are so insanely buffed they can handle it, have them pull an 
extra who will be beating itself to death on the tanks while the kill its 
friend.

Your heals can help a lot- it does not look like you are making much 
pogress but that is just because the bar is so huge. 

Another thing is learning the Druid art of playing Ghettochanter. Piss a 
mob off (burn is nice for this), drag it away from the group a bit, and 
root it.

Lastly, when I was playing a druid I got invited to more than one group for 
Snare. Snaring mobs is invaluable in many zones where trains can happen 
fast... If you are keeping all the mobs snared then you may as well be 
keeping your party SoWed.
