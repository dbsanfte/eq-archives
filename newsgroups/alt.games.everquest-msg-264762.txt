I agree that this is a critical factor, and this is one reason I'm favorably 
disposed toward EQ2. I've been playing in beta for a couple of months now 
and have taken two characters into the 20's (my current main is a 21 
Mystic/22 Alchemist) and I make the following observations:

1) I've explored maybe 50% of my starting *continent* on the Qeynos side;
2) I've explored maybe 2% of the starting continent on the Freeport side, 
having hunted there only twice;
3) I've only gained two flags for access quest restricted instanced zones 
(Firemyst Gully and Shattered Vale). Of these, I've explored FG extensively, 
but have never been inside SV because I could never find a group of players 
who were also flagged (SV requires that everyone in the group be flagged, 
and one cannot enter with less than a 4-6 player group);
4) I've never discovered any of the Heritage quests (Screaming Mace, 
Journeyman Boots, Greater Lightstone, Shiny Brass Shield, etc);
5) I've never found any of the starting points for quests leading to the 
other continents (Everfrost, etc);
6) I've completed hundreds of quests, and have maybe another hundred pending 
in my journal.

and so on. I'm overwhelmed by a sense of unexplored content. I read posts 
from the 30+ players describing their journeys into Everfrost, the Enchanted 
Lands, and other mid-level continents and the zones therein, and I wonder 
how much more content there is there, not to mention the high end stuff that 
no one has seen in the high 40's to 50.

In addition to all the adventuring and exploring one can do, there's also 
crafting, a rich and complex world of its own that will keep me busy for 
months. And if I tire of either of those two activities, I can simply run 
around and complete quests in my quest journal all day and gain significant 
experience from this activity, leveling as I go. Three basically distinct 
sets of activities that I can always turn to for something to do, and I'm 
nowhere near approaching a point of feeling like I've seen most of any one 
of them.

For whatever other problems EQ2 has, as far as I can tell a lack of content 
is not one of them.
