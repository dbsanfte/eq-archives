You are incorrect.

YOUR is a possessive, as in "your house", "your car", "your bag of
peanuts".  YOU'RE is an abbreviation of YOU ARE, as in "you are
better".  Your (possessive) statement was:

"Come back and judge me when your better than me, and when you
actually mean jack shit to me."

In this statement, YOU'RE is correct, as the abbreviation of YOU ARE.

When someone corrects you, thank them.  I review resumes of people who
apply to the company I work for.  If you have *any* typographic
mistakes in your resume, it goes straight into the trash.  I don't
care how much experience you have, what machines you work on, or what
degrees you may have earned; if you can't write at least as well as I
can, we don't want you.
