Heh, too funny.  It was probably taraid:raid.  We will be making another go
at it, just as soon as the rogue in question gets her answer back from the
GMs regarding getting her turn in items back, as the General failed to
spawn.  It is taking quite some time, the guides that answer her petition
are nice, and polite, and refer it to a GM.  The GM then escelates it to a
lead GM or somesuch, and, she has yet to hear from them.  She did also go
the email route, still waiting on a response there too.
