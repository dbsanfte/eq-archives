There would be a Cancer MotD every day for the rest of the games life.

But 9/11 was not just a day of death, it was also a day that brought
together this nation  is a way not seen since Pearl Harbor. It won't
be memorialized next year in the same way. It's a day of unity where I
can stand next to you and know that we stand for the same things.
Life, Liberty and Happiness.

So I take it you are playing from Ireland, or maybe Lebanon, no you
must be hooked up in Israel or Palestine, South Africa? No , I'm
pretty sure you somewhere safe where going to the market won't get up

you, well then I'm sure your safe in the US.
