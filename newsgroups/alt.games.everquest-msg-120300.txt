I own 3 dogs and one cat.  All of them are treated with affection.  The dogs
are hopelessly loyal, wonderfully friendly, loving pets.  The cat, doesn't
care much about my existence one way or the other, except for when it's food
time, or the rare occasion that he would like me to pay attention to him.
The cat adores my wife, he constantly demands attention from her, he also
attacks her with little to no warning.  Bite (and scratch) the hand that
feeds you, yep, that's intelligence at work.  Mind you, he still gets fed,
hmmm....

I think the following best illustrates the difference between cats and dogs.

EXCERPTS FROM A CAT'S DIARY

DAY 752 - My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling
objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while I am forced to eat dry
cereal. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of escape, and the
mild satisfaction I get from ruining the occasional piece of furniture.
Tomorrow I may eat another houseplant.


DAY 761 - Today my attempt to kill my captors by weaving around their feet
while they were walking almost succeeded, must try this at the top of the
stairs. In an attempt to disgust and repulse these vile oppressors, I once
again induced myself to vomit on their favorite chair...must try this
on their bed.


DAY 765 - Decapitated a mouse and brought them the headless body, in attempt
to make them aware of what I am capable of, and to try to strike fear into
their hearts. They only cooed and condescended about what a good little cat
I was .....Hmmm. Not working according to plan.


DAY 768 - I am finally aware of how sadistic they are. For no good reason I
was chosen for the water torture. This time however it included a burning
foamy chemical called "shampoo." What sick minds could invent such a liquid.
My only consolation is the piece of thumb still stuck between
my teeth.


DAY 771 - There was some sort of gathering of their accomplices. I was
placed in solitary throughout the event. However, I could hear the noise and
smell the foul odor of the glass tubes they call "beer". More importantly I
overheard that my confinement was due to MY power of "allergies." Must learn
what this is and how to use it to my advantage.


DAY 774 - I am convinced the other captives are flunkies and maybe
snitches.The dog is routinely released and seems more than happy to return.
He is obviously a half-wit. The bird on the other hand has got to be an
informant, and speaks with them regularly. I am certain he reports my every
move. Due to his current placement in the metal room his safety is assured.
But I can wait, it is only a matter of time...
