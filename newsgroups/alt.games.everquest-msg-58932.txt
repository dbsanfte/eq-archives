In outdoor settings, I'd stick with a Druid.  he can just run the nasties
around while the group keeps fighting.  When they get done with what they
are fighting, they pull one off the running druids stack and keep going.
I've used the "catch me if you can" routine to keep the group at full health
with a large train chasing me in circles before.  The bigger wolf forms are
not sharable and they allow a druid to hit some pretty impressive speeds so
this is an excellent method of "healing" without mana <grin>

Indoors, Shaman are superior to Druids.  Sure they may not last all that
much longer but 1 round is a tad on the shy side.  My druid can't stand
anywhere near what an equivelent level shammy can handle.
