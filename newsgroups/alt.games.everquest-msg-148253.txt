Umm dipshit? Maybe they don't feel the need to follow the mob of false
patriotic morons that are ruining the media now a days? They have the
right to do or not do whatever the hell they want because this is
America, so I suggest you take your little fat rage you have going
there and direct it at someone who deserves it, I praise EQ for not
following the crowd just to be popular.

PS- If you're gonna flame like an idiot please make it about something
that matters?
