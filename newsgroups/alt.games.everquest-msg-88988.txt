It's not so much an educated guess, as the fact that the trades in EC (or
wherever) actually _define_ 'the price' for an item. There is no objective
standard for EQ item prices (other than what a vendor will offer, which is
largely irrelevant) - indeed 'the price' changes every time a transaction is
made. For example, player A sells a ykesha to player B for 700pp. Two
minutes later, player C buys a ykesha from player D for 1kpp. What is 'the
price' of a ykesha? If you are selling, whatever you can get; if you are
buying, the least you can get it for. Only by observing patterns over time
can one learn _general_ ideas about what items _tend to_ be traded for.
