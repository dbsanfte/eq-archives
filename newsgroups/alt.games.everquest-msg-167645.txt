First the riot over Monkly Business. Now EQTC has switched to another
message board. EQbeastlord is exploring options. Lots of guilds are
jumping ship. Woody's right in today's /GU... Tombstone for EZBoard
that reads "I killed myself for money".

This may not topple EZBoard by a long shot, but hopefully it'll be a
good kick in the head that people aren't going to sit by and simply
accept being overcharged.

Yes, I know running a message board system the size of EZBoard isn't
cheap. But I also know it's not THAT damn expensive...
