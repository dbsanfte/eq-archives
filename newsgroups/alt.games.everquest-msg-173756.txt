There was an event I heard in North Ro once, some guy challenging people 
to find him, and mentioning something about "five different shapes", and 
that we'd have to hail him to win.  So I ran to the Commons, where he 
claimed he'd be hanging out, and hailed every bloody rock, tree, and NPC 
I saw.  Turned out he was simply walking up and down the path in normal 
form, and some kid found him and got (gasp) a silver jasper ring.

Lesson learned - instead of spending an hour acting like an idiot in the 
Commons, ignore GM event shouts and stay where you are.  Of course, if 
he *had* handed me a silver jasper ring after all that work, somebody 
might have died. ;p
