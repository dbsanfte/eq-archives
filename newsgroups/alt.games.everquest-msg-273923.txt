I look forward to getting there and experiencing it, I see general chat 
about Uldaman all the time and now I'm really intrigued. Unfortunately, 
right now I'm sitting in a queue with 587 players ahead of me (estimated 
time to log in another 33 minutes). Pretty annoying, but I understand the 
problem is only on the more populous servers? Unfortunately, my wife and I 
chose this server because our son plays there so we don't want to move. Do 
you know if Blizzard provides an option to move your characters to another 
server? I might be able to convince him and his friends to move, I think 
they're all fed up with the queues.
