The "EQ Moron Type" protocol been revised and renamed "EQ Moron
(type)", didn't you get the memo?  Just FYI:

"Clueless testing expert" has been reclassified as EQM(t)09 with
the following qualified sub-classification:
EQM(t)09a "Clueless testing expert with over 20 years experience"

EQM(t)17 is now "Clueless business expert", with several qualified
sub-classifications:
EQM(t)17a "Clueless business expert with supermodel wife"
EQM(t)17c "Clueless business expert with own software company"
EQM(t)17b "Clueless business expert with Fortune 100 clients"
an additional 14 sub-classifications of EQM(t)17 are currently under
review.
