Research is like any other tradeskill.

You have a container in which to combine the items.

You have a number of items, to put in said container, which when combined
will make an attempt at creating the spell.

Research can be trained FULLY at your guild leader, this is capped by level.

The items you need vary by spell, check out eqcastersrealm and then
eqtraders for the recipes.

Mostly the items needed are random drops from mobs, within 5 levels of the
spell you want or so.

When I started my necro, and did research (the hard way, via practice runes,
same on wizard, didnt know about / training wasnt implemented at the time),
I often had to go a level or two above the actual spell level to have a good
shot at making the spell, some components can be rare.

It is definitely worth training research, as an int caster there is nothing
much else worth spending points on anyway, and later on you can collect and
combine spells for the WIS casters and make some cash :)

Good luck.
