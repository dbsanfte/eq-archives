In the process of trying to figure out what AAs to get for my
enchanter I read some posts on the importance of Combat Agility, since
that allows me to avoid hits completely.  So I went for it, all 3
levels of it, 12 AAs. 

Now I'm wondering how worthwhile it was.  I've noticed that once in a
rare while (4 times in 2 hours, according one recently log) I "dodge"
a blow.  Is that how success at Combat Agility shows up?  I don't
recall dodging before.  I did check at the trainer and my dodge is
maxed out. 

I know at the 3rd level of C.A. I supposedly avoid hits 10% of the
time.  The tank didn't have great aggro (had lousy aggro) and I can
guarantee you I got whacked more than 40 times.  Sometimes it seemed
like one mob whacked me 40 times. 

If 12 AAs of C.A. really only saved me 4 blows in 2 hours, it seems
like an incredible waste.
