My other PC runs Win XP home ed.
however there are small differences between Win 98 and ME, if only in
so far as you sometimes cannot install ME drivers on 98, as
experienced by me most recently when trying to install asus
motherboard drivers.
Mrowh 55/54 Beastlord on Karana
Frostfist 35 Beastlord on Stromm
Otserp 32 Mage on Venril Sathir
Wikkan 42 Druid on Karana, Nekk 32 Necromancer, Moorbane 26 Warrior, Zinga 32 Bard, etc....
