Any weapon that has a wisdom bonus will work here - there are some steins you can get that are blunt weapons with stats
I took my self to Kurns tower - and camped the jester. I was able to extend that to camp everything on the bottom floor when
the place was empty - which was any day Mon-Thu usually. I collected finger bones for the Iksar monk quest (and sold them
 at a tidy profit) I collected Burynai hide armor - almost a complete set, some of which I am still
wearing in my 30s. AND I spent about 8 weeks doing it. COULD have been finished in ONE, but 
my partner wanted a club as well - so I waited it out. +4Wis and a Faster weapon you couldn't ask
for. - Everyso often I simmer with Fury - which sounds fun in battle.

Love the weapon - All my tips for strategy can be found, along with SilverLites at Alahkazam -  Strategy discusion on KURNS Tower.
