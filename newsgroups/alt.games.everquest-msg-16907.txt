GD Tizmaks are nice, but on The Rathe it can sometimes be hard to get a
group.  You don't need much.  With just a 27 Druid and my 31 Chanter we took
Tizmak 1 all day.  Nasty down time, and only a pull every five to ten
minutes, but decent XP and the drops sell for 3 to 6 PP.  A 30 Warrior and a
29+ Druid could easily handle things there.  If you have a third of any
type, the druid does not have to be 29.  I used my pet as our third and it
worked fine.

Also a nice place for Monks.  There is no cash to split, only items.  If the
Monk has a good weight reducing bag they can keep the loot on them.  If not,
have someone you trust hold your loot items, then get them when you leave
the group.

Fear kiting is very workable, and I do suggest it for the Furious Tizmak
mobs, or have a group that can just take them down.  We had a 35 SK with the
druid and I for a bit.  It worked very well using him to tank rather than my
pet.

If someone forms a Kodiak group, you can go for that, but make sure they
have the right healing.  A L25 Cleric or L30 Druid has the better heal, and
is one level past getting it so they will have some mana to use it.  A
backup healer is STRONGLY recomended for Kodiak groups.

Kodie loot sucks.  XP is nice.

Both Kodies and Cows (Tizmaks - they go Moo) are (as far as I can tell)
non-issues faction wise.
