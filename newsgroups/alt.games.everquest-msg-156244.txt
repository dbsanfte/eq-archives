I do the same thing when chain stunning is needed from my cleric

/cast 1 (stun)
/cast 2 (holy might)
/cast 3 (force)
/cast 4 (I forget the name of this spell I hardly ever cast it... force of
beer breath?)

where the casts are my stuns in order from cheapest to most expensive.  If
the first one is ungreyed, it will cast and I'll get three "you can't do
that at this time" messages, because the macro is trying to cast while I'm
already casting.  If its greyed, I will get "that spell is not yet ready"
and it will try the second one, and so on down the line.  Due to the nature
of spell refresh, I can mash this continuously and get constant stun, and
even so cast the cheaper stuns more often than the most expensive one.  If
I'm not chain stunning but need to keep the mob interrupted, mashing the
button less than full time means I more frequently cast just the first one
or two, and there's still no need for me to make intelligent descisions
about which spell to cast; this macro will always pick the cheapest spell
available.  Less hesitation this way, so I get more interrupt stuns off.

I was wondering, though, looking at your first macro, how that might work
for me.  I'll ignore the sense heading, I've long since maxed that out and I
have the compass to tell me where I'm headed.  But /doability 1 (bash)
interests me.  I'd love to have a button that bashes and if bash is
available does not cast the stun.  But I suspect bash is instant, and so the
stun will cast after all, whether its needed as an interupt or not.  So
hmm.  Perhaps I should try a new macro just for interrupts:

/cast 1 (stun)
/bash
/cast 2 (Holy Might)


My theory here is that if stun is available, I won't bash because I'll be
busy casting.  If stun is gone, I'll bash (which sometimes works and
sometimes doesn't, I only have a 113 skill so far anyway) and then cast Holy
Might whether it worked or not.  Bashing here will give me a shot at
interrupting spells that are too fast cast for HM to get to.
