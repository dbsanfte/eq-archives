Okay, I have to disagree with this. I think that FOB is a horrible area
for newbies. There are trains GALORE, and to get from the fighting area
to any sort of guard is a pretty good trek. Plus, there's the whole
issue of a bunch of clueless n00bs. LoIO has its own drawbacks too, but
usually you can ignore alot of that stuff. I have an Ikkie Shaman on
Bertox, and leveled him pretty fast around there. There's no shortage of
Sabertooth Kittens and the like, and no matter how hard you're hitting
one, none of the others will agro on you. There are Sarnak hatchlings
that have a pretty good quest associated with them that you don't even
have to zone for, there are Merchants that sell everything you'll need
out there, and you can EASILY go from 1-30 in that one zone alone.
Different strokes for different folks, I guess, but I really like LoIO
alot more than FOB, and I'd recommend that any one starting an Iksar
give it a shot. Nine out of ten times, I am the only one out there, so
it's all for my taking. =)
