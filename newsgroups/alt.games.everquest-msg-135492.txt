I was pretty sure Rodcet Nife at least shares that dubious honor.  One of
the first second-wave servers to open and never been split.

Sounds familiar.  Though Kael is kinda neglected for some reason on Rodcet,
except for AoW.

Very familiar.

Poorly in how similar it is.  I always thought Rodcet would be the *next*
split server, but then they stopped splitting servers.  It's such a
top-heavy server it's nuts.
