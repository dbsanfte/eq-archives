I was wondering if a Wizard could single pull from a group of mobs that does
not see through invis by casting a bolt spell from max range, and then,
before the bolt hits, invising himself.  The idea is that if he is invis
when the bolt hits, perhaps the others won't come with the one he hits.  (I
got this idea reading an earlier thread here, where someone mentioned that
single pulling by throwing something and then using a right-click instant
cast invis item worked).

With an extended range focus item to give more range to the bolt, and
another focus item cutting down the cast time of invis from 5 seconds to 3.5
seconds--it did not work.  Invis still took too long to cast, but just
barely.

So, I'm wondering--does the AA ability that cuts down spell casting time
stack with focus items?  The AA ability only works on spells that take
longer than 4 seconds to cast, I believe, so even if they stack in general,
would it not stack in this case, because the focus item brings invis down to
3.5, which is less than 4, or is the check for the AA ability based on the
base casting time?
