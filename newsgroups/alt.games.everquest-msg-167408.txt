    It's pretty much standard dungeon protocols.

    Not that I've seen, and I use cleric mez on things so I root a fair
amount.

    Some things summon, but for the life of me I can't remember what they
are. I THINK it's the named stuff and that's it. I know the regular puslings
don't summon, as I've tried to solo them with root-nuke tactics.

    Ok. There's two named puslings, Greater Foul Pusling and Greater
Corrupted Pusling, both spawn in any pusling spawn point as far as I know
(it would certainly explain the frequency). One drops the Circled Toe Bones,
one drops the Mace of the Fallen Crusader. You will see many of these,
especially if you pull to zone. Sadly, the Mace is the more common of the
two.

    If Carpin is dead, you can set up shop (with a cc person) in the room
with the walkway over the acidic sludge (yes, it hurts you). Named undead
have the same name as the regular ones, except with a higher class title. So
for example, the named Pestillence Priest is the Pestillence Archon, and the
named Firebone Magus is the Firebone Archmagus. Wracking my brain for
drops.... Wicked Bone Atatl, some sort of semi-cruddy chain legs,
Bile-Drenched Shoes or some such thing (leather classes, not so hot).
Nothing else I remember. Pulling to zone, it's likely you'll see some of
these undead.

    Also, if you have a cc person you can set up in the room to the right
from zone-in, right before the muscle-like tunnels. There, you get
Bubonians - giant versions of the dire-charmable rats at zone-in. Bubonian
Grand Mystic spawns on a timer, and drops the Skull Charm. It's worth going
down that way just to get all your priest-classes one of those, it's very
nice. The other named is also on a timer, and that's the Bubonian
Deathsomethingorother. He drops the Bubonian Bandage Turbin, which I've been
trying to get for my little INT-casters with no success (boo, CLR rolls).
I've seen the Grand Mystic be pulled to zone once, when two groups were both
at zone and both pulling from that direction. I've never seen the
Deathsomethingorother at zone, but he's quite common if you're camping rats.

    There are event-level NPCs in the left and right wings, like Carpin up
the middle, but they're out of the way and unlikely to do more than kill
your puller once.

    The Bubonians - I THINK. You have to pass several puslings to get there,
though, and the Bubonian area is very cramped quarters with a fair chunk of
wanderers. I don't think you could make it there and fight there solo using
druid charm techniques. You could experiment with adding a friend to the
party if a puller brings one in, though - there's lots of running room and
useful pathing in the zone-in area.
