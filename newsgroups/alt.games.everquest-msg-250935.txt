So my druid finally dinged 20, and I'm playing around with her new
Tracking skill.  (I was a bit startled to find that I got it at
skill level 1 immediately, even before I put a training point into
it.)  It's extremely handy, but I find I wish there were a few
things I could do with it.  I realise that Rangers can do extra
things, but these are things I don't see how to do even for a
Ranger:

Once I have something on track, is there any way to make it be my
target?  It's frustrating sometimes to be running toward something
and see another of the same (or a similar-looking) thing and think
it's the one I was tracking.  Usually, of course, one is as good
as another, but if I was tracking a white con and the one I find
is yellow or red, it can get painful!

But the main thing I want to be able to do is turn it off!  Once
I select something to track, the window goes away.  I chase down
the target, and typically go into battle with it.  Now, in the
middle of battle, I keep getting all the tracking messages, which
are at best a waste and at worst keep me from seeing other stuff
in that chat window.  (Which I think has to include all other
skill-related messages, since I assume tracking messages are
covered by that filter?)  The only way I've found to shut it off
is to bring up the tracking window again and click on the Cancel
button.  The window is on a hotkey, but I have to use the mouse
to hit the button, which I find awkward.  Is there a /command I
can type (and thus put in a macro) that will turn off tracking?

On a related note, I've done some searching on line (on ranger
sites as well as druids) and haven't found any pages that talk
about fine points of the tracking skill, or even about major
stuff such as what the heck my skill level means.  I think my
tracking range has gone up as I skilled up, but I wasn't
keeping careful track (no pun intended!) so I'm curious if
anyone's worked out the formula for max range.  I'd also like
to know if increasing my skill has any other effects.

Thanks for any help!
