    Greenmist, like Inny's curse, looks like far too many hours of questing
to get a weapon that no longer justifies the time spent.

    If that 17/22 (2hp less average damage no lifetap proc - no biggie) is
only 3k, well, I can farm enough plat in rathe hopefully in a fraction of
the time it would take to do the Greenmist quest. Not as cool, but I'm kind
of a numbers player.

Regards,
James
