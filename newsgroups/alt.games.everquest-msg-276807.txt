Been playing EQ2 for a few months but am bored of it now. I still have 2 1/2 
months of play time left and would like to sell my account. The problem is 
that my account still has all my billing information which I cannot change 
unless I purchase more game time!

Any ideas how I can get around this problem?

Thanks
