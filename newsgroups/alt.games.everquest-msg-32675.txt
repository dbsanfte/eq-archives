No but there is not much you can do about it, petition will not help on a
single occurance like this and from what I have heard it happens a lot.
The best way to do it legit is with a small group, Tank (holds him up and
makes it obvious he's engaged) Healer (Keeps tank alive, assuming tank isn't
capable of solo'ing AC) and Caster (Wiz best but most can fill this role)
Nukes the hell out of him and thinks nothing for mana.
How it normally works, Mid level character or Partnership try to get him to
spawn. He spawns, High level caster nukes and KS's lower level member of the
KS'ers guild loots.
The zone is pretty much FFA and this often degenerates into whoever can dish
the most damage gets the kill. Maybe they should apply Warrens loot laws to
the AC ;�)

Can't really be bothered with J Boots just keep buying SoW potions (although
with the money I've spent on them I could have bought T Boots :�))
