Ohhhhhh, you may be right.  I think I misread this line in the log:

>Paul Carrico: The taunt return message will be for everyone, not just
Warriors. <

I took that to mean, "Everyone will see the message."  Which would be
horribly spammy.  I think your interpretation is right--all taunters will
get a return message, *not* that the group will hear it.

My bad!
