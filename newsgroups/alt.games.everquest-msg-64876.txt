And here's a crapload of them
http://eqshots.50megs.com/
(I used http://eqshots.50megs.com/cwdata/sleeper23%5B1%5D.html as my desktop
for a while)

Oddly, in the series of shots at that last site, it looks like he double
spawned or is out of phase with himself or something
(easy to see here, 2 headed and 2 tailed appearance
http://eqshots.50megs.com/cwdata/sleeper13%5B1%5D.html )

Hope this is what you're looking for.
