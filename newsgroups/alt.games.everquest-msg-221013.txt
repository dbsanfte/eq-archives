    I like that idea. To take it further, maybe even eliminate the defensive
penalty on Aggressive, so the warrior also has a way to gain faster aggro at
the cost of losing /defensive for a bit.

    Two things: one, they have an AA which does exactly that. Two, the
problem isn't an issue until you hit mobs that can mitigate DPS
significantly from the front. By the time you see such mobs, you're at raid
level, and assuming that a player at that level of the game has every tool
they require is standard for the devs. From the parses on end-game weapons
being done on Steel Warrior, it's quite apparent that the designers consider
AA's to be part of the class when balancing DPS via itemization.

    This is why changing relative DPS between warriors and knights doesn't
mean much, though. The tank isn't doing much of the group's damage, the
damage dealers are. Unless the difference between a knight's DPS and a
warrior's DPS is equal to or greater than the the combined difference
between what DPS the rest of the group can churn out with a warrior and what
they can churn out with a knight, you still come out on top with the knight.
And the DPS gap is huge when you consider the insane numbers level 65
characters can churn out on blue mobs. From the Steel Warrior parses,
top-end warriors on level 61 target, no buffs, are putting out about 110 DPS
to a knight's 90 DPS. With haste and buffs, call it 165 to 135. I've seen
wizards post theoretical numbers indicating that with their current mana
regen, spell haste, and foci they could top 300 DPS IF aggro wasn't a
consideration. And that's just one wizard!
