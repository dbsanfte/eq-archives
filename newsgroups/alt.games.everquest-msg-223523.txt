Twinked?  I was wearing a full suit of self-made (green) Fine Plate and my
weapon at the time, as best I recall, was a Silvery 2H Axe.

The one thing that really makes the difference, as far as I can tell, is
that I chain-cast Flash of Light.  As long as you're in contact the mobs
won't run, and they absolutely hate that spell.



PS:  When I hit 48, I was still using the same equipment.  I got into a
pickup group at the Rygorr Fort in EW.  The first that dropped was a Rygorr
Bracer.  Most of the group knew me and what I wear.  When the GL asked who
should get it, most of the group pointed at me.  Other than my DW helm, it
was the first piece of armour I'd ever gotten that I didn't make myself.
