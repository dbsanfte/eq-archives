I've always believed that the envious will be the first to see others as 
such. As long as you continue to refuse to see it as anything else, you 
will continue to be disgruntled about it. I'm sorry, but being able to 
produce *much* more sustained DPS that the rest of your group combined is 
just broken. That can't even be debated.

I would agree with that, and if it were a simple matter, I'm sure that's 
the way they would have it happen. However, what you are ignoring is the 
fact that they are most certainly mining data and observing the problem 
for quite some time before they just jump in swinging the nerf bat. Just 
because they can implement the fix in a single patch doesn't mean it was 
on a whim.

You should. Class balance should be a concern for everyone, regardless of 
whether they benefit from any perceived imbalances or not. However, this 
should be in the interest of what's best for the game, not out of envy as 
you insist on claiming.

Your arguments aren't exactly stating otherwise. You are very upset about 
the fixing of an undeniable point of imbalance. What message is that 
*supposed* to convey?

So you only want input to be heard from people who play that class? Talk 
about stacking the deck. That said, I play a chanter as well, though not 
as my main and not yet in the upper levels.
