Perhaps that was a bit harsh.    A bit.   Perhaps.

In any event, I do thank you for the description of what can be gotten from
GoD AA's and such.

As for the rest, it comes down to this.   What makes a warrior exceptional?
What makes one warrior better than another?   In the old days it was skill
at holding aggro.  You had to both understand and perform to be able to do
it consistantly.  And thats a much better situation than what it appears to
be today.   "Have you sat around long enough at raids to get enough gear to
survive the hits?   Can you manage to find both taunt buttons, as well as
your auto attack button?"

GoD content hits harder and takes better gear to get in.  Big deal.  The
individual skill involved in being a warrior and playing with one is gone.
