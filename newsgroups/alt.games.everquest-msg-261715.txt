I've been using one for about a month now.  The only issue I have had 
with it is when going from windowed to full screen mode, I have to slide 
the gamma up and down, and the same with the clipping plane.  It's a 
minor annoyance, but, one I find well worth the performance increase over 
the GF4 4200 and GF 5200 I used prior to it.  Had I had lots of extra 
cash lying around, I probably would have opted for the latest GF card.

I have not yet downloaded the latest ATI drivers, I am told they fix the 
annoyance of having to diddle with the settings on changing modes.
