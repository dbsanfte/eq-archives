My experience with the ogre was the same. I figured the stuff would be
ok, but it was better then ok. I had honestly thought that he was
giving me only backpacks with random junk in them to sell for a few
coppers each at the merchant. I felt really bad when I all I did was
/thank him and continued on my merry way. I wanted to sincerely thank
him through a private tell. I wanted to give him the satisfaction of
the kind of thank you that you mention above but I will probably never
see him again.
