BST can hold agro way easier then people understand and FAR easier then
Warriors.  FOL and Drowsy, along with poison dots will generally guarantee
you keep agro from many classes, including paladins, shadowknights and
rangers that aren't playing the full out agro game.

Shaman heal over time is great, sure, but when you chose a healer for a
group "generally" you want a "heal me now or I will die" class in which case
a druid will outperform a shaman

BST can slow, and offtank 2 adds easily.  Once you have built up some
defensive AA points a good BST can tank just fine as can the 62/64 warder.
At least for as long as it takes the main mob to be killed.

I can count the number of melee/hybrid toons that can consistently outdamage
a BST on one hand.  Monks and Rogues out-dps the BST him/herself but with
the pet added in, as well as nukes/dots BST are king of noncaster dps.  And
overtime rank right up their with the casters for sustained dps.

Again I feel I have to defend BST here, IMHO BST are far more useful then
necros and even chanters.  Kragg/IOS + SV give more hp then focus and allow
STA and DEX buffs to stack as well.  It's why you sometimes see melees
running for cover when a shaman begins to cast mgb focus on a raid.  Sure it
takes up more slots, but more hp and dex is often more wanted then just
saving a slot.  We can also slow (65%) and haste (50%), can regen for
24hp/tick (regrowth + SD) and regen mana points for 9/tick.  Once you have
the paragon AA ability (99% of people have no idea what this is btw) our
mana regen utility goes through the roof.  We can ghetto fear kite (FOL),
buff stats + resists, off tank, pet tank, and agro kite all while out-dpsing
most melee/hybrid toons out there.
