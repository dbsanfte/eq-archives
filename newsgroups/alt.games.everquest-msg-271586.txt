The populations are lower.  Mudflation of equipment continues with each 
expansion.  As newer and better equipment is available, the older 
equipment goes down in price.  As more of the new runes become available 
their price goes down.

The game is essentially the same game, either you like it or you don't.  
If you left because you did not enjoy it, I would not anticipate that you 
will suddenly start liking it now.
