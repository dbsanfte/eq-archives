Is that dependent upon the order in which the invis is "layered" on? The
reason I ask is that just yesterday my rogue and wife's mage were in NK
turning in some lightstones to the gypsies. One was to stay invis
watching for wanderers while the other did the turnins. When I was
hidden and she cast invis on me, I got the ".. tries to cast on you but
you are already invisible" message. No icon, and I was still hidden and
indif to the gypsies (who dislike me, for some fucked up reason, while
they like *her* gnome just fine. Guess it's a Brell vs. Agnostic
thingie.) 

However, when I had invis on and tried to hide, I got the "failed to
hide yourself" message (which may just be random bad luck. My Hide skill
is only 75), I still had the invis icon, but I was clearly visible. I
had to click the icon off and re-hide to get invis again.
