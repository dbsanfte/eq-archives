I disagree.  Yes, discipline is required, but that long document mixed up
the process of dealing with single boss targets, easy trash, tough trash,
and bosses with adds.

If it said 'wait for assist' and nothing else then yes it may be the same,
otherwise the document is confusing (on our raids, anyone waiting for
assist calls on trash may wait a long time, but the key is to train your
raiders what to expect not necessarily what you train them).
