The pathing in Oasis was fixed a few months back... as evidenced by the fact
that fleeing crocs on the strip between the ocean and the lake no longer get
'stuck' next to the tree (damn... my casters are now gonna have to find a
new 'safe way' to practice melee).

Unfortunately there ARE some 35+ers that train specs to the docks... because
they know they can distract the spec with lowbie fodder long enough to med a
little more before finishing the fight... or hope that some mid-level
waiting for the barge to OT can finish off the mob so that the puller can
still get the xp (if you zone you loose everything... if you can get help,
you can salvage some xp from it)

Then there are the Druids who kite along the beach... because that's where
they learnt to kite when they were 14 and practicing on caiman...

And the monks and necros that feign-pull from the tower... and couldn't care
less WHERE the extra specs go, just so long as they fall for the FD...




Sadly there are too many clowns whose only interest in the MM part of MMORPG
is that they have an audience to boast to when they hit 60 :o(
