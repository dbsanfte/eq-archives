Does that res all corpses?  I thought it just did one.  Even better if 
it does all!

But if it only does one, and you've deleveled down to 10 in the time it 
took to do all your testing, you're gonna be a bit steamed.

Is the Bazaar itself unbindable?  How about Shadowhaven?  Drowning, as 
someone else suggested, will be a pretty fast death and easily arranged 
in SH.

Death by falling.  I've taken 10k damage in CC, but thats unreliable, 
you can easily hit bridges and take paltry 300ish damage. You could bind 
in CC... but if they force you to bind in the city part, running back up 
to the top would be a pain, unless Succor takes you there, and even 
then, we're looking at mana costs to die enough times to lose a level as 
onerous.  If you can bind up top, you could jump, and if you miss the 
bottom, gate back up and try again.  Once you worked out the exact spot 
to jump from, binding there would make it easily repeatable.

Took 10 K damage falling off the cliffs that make up the sides of the 
ramp down into Kael Drakkar. You could maybe bind inside KD and run out 
to die... but I'm thinking drowing would be faster.

10K damage falling into the Hole, and Paineel should be bindable, but 
you'd be zoning, dieing, zoning again, so more time consuming than a 
simple fall to death.  Also, you'd have to do the CR in a hostile zone, 
although I think there's nothing deadly right there where you fall, usually.

NPC's.  People hunt in Thurgadin a lot, I'm sure it doesn't count as a 
starting city.  If you're KOS there, how about Kael Drakkar, same thing. 
  Skyshrine, I'm afraid the high level mobs are really deep inside, but 
if you aren't KOS thats just one long walk to set up, once you're bound 
there you're fine... assuming they let you bind there.

I also assume you're on the Firiona Vie server, since otherwise this 
bind thing wouldn't be an issue at all.
