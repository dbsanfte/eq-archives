Interesting. That would be somewhat inconvenient for someone who happened 
to be playing at that time. Like I said though, I saw no problem 
whatsoever within my play schedule.

So a particular updated file was omitted from the patch package. That is 
neither unbelievable nor an indication of incompetence. Sure, it should 
have been caught. It wasn't. Deal with it while they sort it out for a 
few hours. The game still winds up better for it.

I have no idea what you're getting at there. DT and I have never 
particularly seen eye to eye on a regular basis. The fact that I believe 
you may be being a bit overzealous in your criticism or unreasonable in 
your expectations doesn't automatically make me a Sony sympathizer. 

Just keep it in perspective. Take out that few hours of downtime - 
something that happens, what, *at most* once a month, if that - and 
you're left with a game that you still have no problem at all dumping 
oodles of time into. I'd say the good far outweighs the bad. I have heard 
of and experienced far worse online ventures. AC2, for one, was 
unplayable for me - but that's another story.

It's been my experience that that is not the norm where bugs - and there 
will always be bugs - are concerned in EQ, but it is bound to happen.
