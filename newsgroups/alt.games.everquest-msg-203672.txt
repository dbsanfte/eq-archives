Starting at 44, Beastlords get their Spiritual line of spells that regen hp
and mana.  They're not much, but they stack with the clarity line and regen,
so their a nice addition.  Also referred to as "Kitty crack", at least on
The Rathe, but as 4 of the beastlord races aren't cats, I choose not to
refer to it as this.  If anyone asks me for kitty crack, I make them call it
lizard crack before I'll cast =P.

Spiritual Light - 44 - 3 hp/tick 3 mana/tick
Spiritual Radiance - 52 - 5 hp/tick 5 mana/tick
Spiritual Purity - 59 - 7 hp/tick 7 mana/tick
Spiritual Dominion - 64 - 9 hp/tick 9 mana/tick


They also get HP regen spells at higher levels (Chloroplast 55 / Regrowth
64).  Some AC, HP and ATK buffs too.  Not as nice as a shaman, naturally,
but not too bad.  If you're going to count the healing ability (Ooh...
Greater healing at 57 =P), you might as well get the others.

I don't know a lot about rangers, but they have identical healing spells to
beastlords.  The healing spells come late if you intend to actually be a
healer during combat, but if you're just helping someone get back to 100
after a fight, they're helpful.

Lots missing here.  Can't forget shammy SoW.  Definitely not with their
improved group version, Spirit of Bih'Li.  They get some nice DD's, and some
very nice DoTs.  They can also haste and root.  Maybe other things missed
too, but I've never played a shaman, so I'm not sure.  I just have a friend
who played one.
