what a frightening thought,  back to the days of 1982 and rebooting
the computer to start a new program.  O wait,  in modern terms it
would be like playing on the x-box or playstation.  

I may be interested in x-box gaming.  but there is no way that i would
want to reboot my system and put in a cd just to play a game.

its bad enough that most games, use a copyprotection that requires
putting a cd in the computer inorder to run.  a copyprotection that is
cracked within hours of the game hitting the market.

but then we have games that seem to think its allright to cripple the
computer, and make it seem like a game console while playing by not
allowing alt-tabbing.   

bahhhh humbug.

while a linux version of EQ is interesting,  its not commercially
viable at this time.
