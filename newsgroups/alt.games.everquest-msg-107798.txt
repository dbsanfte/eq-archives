Good point.  I just tend to like that magic 200 being there, but that isn't
too efficient. =D

I'm in the process of possibly buying a Tattered Hide Cloak (9 AC, 6 Sta, 6
Wis, 8vsDis, 55 HP, 55 Mana)

Getting agro != getting hit, I get hit all the time, but I rarely get agro
(in a group situation; solo, uhh, I've always got agro)

hate camping things.
