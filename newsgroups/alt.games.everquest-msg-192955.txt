I have PoP (I bought Everquest Gold and just got LoY last night), so I'll
have to check this area out. It almost sounds like I'll want to get a SoW
before trying to turn the stones in to the gypsy though.

I've checked that out in the past but I wasn't realy sure what was good
hunting and what was just in my level range, if you know what I mean. Some
areas may have things I can hunt at my level but certain areas seem to be
better hunting at my level and have good loot.
