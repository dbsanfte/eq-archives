I have no problems getting the files now... it's just I think my video card
driver needs updating (I just bought this computer!!) and the driver I have
now won't work with EQ... it gets to the video card selection screen, then I
click OK and it just sends me back to my desktop. It is quite frustrating. I
posted a message earlier but I haven't gotten any replies yet. I'm running
an ATI Mobility Radeon M6, and I tried downloading the latest driver but
something was messed up with the download. Blah! I am not having a nice day!
Oh well...

Brady
