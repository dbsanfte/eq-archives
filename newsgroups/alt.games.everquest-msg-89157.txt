Update.  After the last patch, I now drop to desktop once in a while when
zoning.  Still using 23.11 with Win2k.  I am thinking about downgrading the
drivers and seeing if that helps.  Damn them and their fixes, it was working
very nicely before this patch.  Well, being a software developer myself, I
am all too keenly aware of side effects of fixes.  Shit happens, I just hope
they really fix it next time.  It's probably about one in 10 to 15 zones
that I drop out right now.
