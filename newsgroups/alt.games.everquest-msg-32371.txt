I have the exact same mouse, and didn't have any problems.  I did
install the GAME_WHL.exe patch to fix some problems the mouse was
having in other games, didn't do crap to be honest.  I found that when
the mouse conflicted with a game it had to do with the configuration.

To shut down the config and force the mouse into default mode (which
might help), hit ctrl-alt-del to bring up the task manager, find a
task called em_exec.  Hightlight it and end task.  Now start EQ and
see what happens.

When you finish with EQ, you can start up your mouse settings again by
running the logitech mouse properties program again.
