I'm looking for possibly a new video card for EQ.
I currently have a VooDoo3 3500 AGP.
I'd like to get something that has video capture ability (for my TV tuner
and RCA/S-video connections).
It also needs good DVD playback ability (preferably the card to work as a
hardware DVD decoding so you don't have to use the software based players).
Also I'd like it to be VERY compatible with EQ.

Currently my VooDoo3 3500 AGP (16MB) does all that, but could use more
memory on it.  Does anyone know of another card that would do the same, but
with more memory?

Also I'd probably need advice on removing all traces of the current drivers
as well (that doesn't include having to reload windows).
