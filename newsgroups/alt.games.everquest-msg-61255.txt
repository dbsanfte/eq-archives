Just a quick comment, which I would hope might be of use to various
others who may have certain systems and be looking at upgrading them
prior to teh release of SoL. One of our computers is a Gateway. A few
minutes spent at crucial.com found some very nice RAM, guaranteed
compatible with the machine, for under 40 bucks per. Then there was the
other machine......... my machine...... the new IBM machine......
(You may want to put in some earplugs now, or stop reading if easily
offended, or a big fan of Big Blue.)
My machine is an Intellistation E-Pro Type 6867. And guess what? I found
out some very interesting information when I began seeking a RAM upgrade
for this machine when I placed a call to the IDIOT MUTHERFUCKING
COCKSUCKING CHEAPSKATE SCHEISTER BUTTSUCKING DICKLICKING HEARTLESS
SOULESS DICKLESS CORPORATE COMMUNIST SMEGMA-LICKING RUMP RIDING
BURN-IN-HELL-YOU-ROTTEN-BASTARDS at IBM's sales and service line.

It turns out that the machine has two slots for RAM. However, unlike the
gateway machine which can take upgrade components from a variety of
competing suppliers at very reasonable prices, the IDIOT MUTHERFUCKING
COCKSUCKING CHEAPSKATE SCHEISTER BUTTSUCKING DICKLICKING HEARTLESS
SOULESS DICKLESS CORPORATE COMMUNIST SMEGMA-LICKING RUMP RIDING
BURN-IN-HELL-YOU-ROTTEN-BASTARDS in their design department, had the
courtesy to put proprietary hardware in the box. It's RAM upgrade is a
256 MB RAM 800 MHz ECC 16D RDRAM RIMM stick which sells for the price
of.....
(deep breath)
$209.00 per stick
And while they managed to ship the piece of shit with only one RAM stick
in it, since then the sticks have apparently developed some magical
force attraction to each other, so you can only buy them in pairs, even
if you only wanted 256. 

I just thought I would share this helpful sales and upgrade information
with any interested EQ subscribing consumers who might already have, or
be considering the purchase, of a personal computer from the IDIOT
