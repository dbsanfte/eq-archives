In my experience it can be one of two things (or both!):
- someone who, in a FFA xp camp, loots immediately (also known as ninja
looting, though THAT has another definition as well)
- someone who wants to roll on EVERYTHING, even if you're in a NBG guild
group.

For the record, if I'm grouped with strangers I do want to roll on
everything...I do not believe in NBG when I have no way of verifying that
the troll paladin <mistake on purpose> doesn't already have something nearly
as nice as that Flamberge of Rulest Uberness that sells in bazaar for 60k.
But when I'm with guildies, it's always NBG when there IS an "N."
