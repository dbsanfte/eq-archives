Am i the only one being more and more irritated with the player run 
"Casinos" that seem to be the trend nowadays?

I dont really care about them spamming OOC and shout with their 
adverticement (although a guy in bazaar who fount it neccesary that 
every 5th chat line was his adverticement ended up on my ignore list), 
but seeing all the "I got ripped off by XXX's casino, he took my money 
and logged out" is kinda beginning to bother me. And lets not even talk 
about the endless /random spam, especially in bazaar, which i can NOT 
turn off in any way.


I think its about time that SoE made a statement about those casinos so 
that we can get the following clear:

A. Is running a casino in EQ lega.

B. If a casino scam/go LD/whatever after taking money for a roll, is it 
just too bad for the wannabe gambler, or is it petitionable?

C. If a person is using a casino to scam (eventually making new char for 
it every time), is it up to the GM to track down reported scammers and 
see if he got other chars thats now deleted, that has been reported for 
the same offence.

D. Block all /random in bazaar, zone is MORE than laggy enough already 
without countless /randoms spamming everyone in range.
