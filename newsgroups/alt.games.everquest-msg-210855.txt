POS == Plane of Storms? Something isn't right, unless your group was
killing things *extremely* slow, your exp gain should have been much
faster there. Did you turn up AA exp maybe? 

I went through 90% of level 59 in two (fairly long) nights in POS desert.

The general rule is hunt mobs that are no more than five levels below you.
There is a hefty exp bonus when killing mobs in/above that range. The higher
the better, of course. At level 56 you should still do ok in Tier 1 except 
POJ. The stuff on west side of PON is level 52-53 or so. Banshees and 
nettling wraiths are 55-ish. Bugs in POD castle yard are 56-57. Most 
stuff in POS desert (Tier 2 zone) is 58.
