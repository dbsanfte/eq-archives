Maybe - but otoh, I watch a LOT of anime, and I have yet 
to find a dubbed version that doesn't drive me up the 
wall.  Japanese and English voice preferences seem to be 
VASTLY different.  And I find it usually ends up grating 
on my nerves to hear some cute kid spouting off 
Americanisms in Japan.  (Even if it happens.  I don't 
care.  Stay away from me with reality.)

Also, they tend to butcher dubs but cutting anything and 
everything remotely 'controversial' out.  Oh sure, kids 
can see blood and guts and swearing on tv, and THAT 
won't harm them, but take, for example, a super-popular 
kid's show, Cardcaptor Sakura (and I'll try and take it 
without going insanely overboard. promise!) - there were 
a few same-sex crushes in the show.  *rip*  There was a 
girl heroine who was the focus of the show *tear*  There 
was the storyline that made sense and was actually 
pretty good. *shred*  Go here for an example:

http://www.cardcaptors-uncensored.com/series.shtml

Notice, they didn't even bother showing the first few 
episodes.  Heck no, that'd be silly.  Better skip 
straight through to the episode where the *boy* hero 
arrives.  Girls don't watch tv anyway, right?

You do know you get used to it, right?  Or maybe you 
read slow, I know some subtitles are a touch fast for 
most people (try finding a subtitled version of "Kodomo 
no Omocha".  I DARE you to try and keep up the first 
time) and that usually turns them off subtitled.  I've 
generally chalked that up to laziness >;)

Now I'd better stop before I get going on CCS again...
