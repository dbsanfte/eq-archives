}AGAIN.

Just went to my favorite Sci Fi bookstoore last night... And the -next- 
one in the series is out.  I've forgotten the title already, something to 
do with Salmon, I think.  The proprietor tells me it's actually not bad, 
definitely less of a disappointment than Mostly Harmless was.  It's not 
entirely complete, of course, as most posthumous novels found in the 
bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign 
on the door saying "beware of the leopard" might be expected to be.

I'll be reading it soon, got a couple Discworld novels to catch up on 
first. :)
