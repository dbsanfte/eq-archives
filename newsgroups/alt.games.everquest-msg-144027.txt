Dawnshroud should be okay, I'd think.  There's usually a group
or two there around that level.   The standard answer is OT;
that's where most of the pick-up group players play at that
level.   The other standard (but better) answer is Crystal
Caverns.  There's usually a few groups there and clerics are
generally in demand.  (Druids tend not to like the indoors
because some of their functionality is crippled and shaman
tend not to want to be group healers, at least at that level.)
Good money, especially if you keep some of the drops and sell
them to players (crystalline spider silk and velium drops there;
both are needed for Thurgadin Gate potions.)   And there are a
multitude of mobs which drop good items (wt. red. pack, several
robes, WIS/INT shoes, etc.) as well as some good vendor loot.

CC is one of my favorite zones:  it's well engineered;  it has
a good mob progression;  it has vendors and a bank in-zone; and
it's a really nice-looking zone as well. ;)
