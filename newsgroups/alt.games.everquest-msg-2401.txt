I just love you silly people that review these 2 games... scroll down for my
comments. I may not play EQ anymore but I would still prefer it over AC any
day.

In eq you dont have to click the reply button, just hit R, plus you can now
go through a list of every person that sent a tell since you logged in.

The radar thing made the game feel like I was some sort of mechanical bot. I
felt that way wearing plate. I mean.. why the hell would you have radar on
some role playing game like that.... it is just not right

Play an enchanter, they got the  most spells in the game. There are alot of
repetative spells like that, but many that are not.

Yeah, I mean, we got all sorts of repetative ones... Strengthen 1,
strengthen 2, strengthen 3.... weaken 1, weaken 2, weaken 3 etc.... armor 1,
armor 2... you get the picture. The spells arent worth casting most of the
time. the duration on most of the spells are low... someone cast some level
4 buffs on me before, they lasted like 5 mins, thats about enough time to
get your mana back.
The spells on the armor/jewelery was neat, but it could get expensive
maintaining the mana charges. and yes I took them off when I didnt need
them.

In the long run, hell even a short one, an erudite caster looks alot
different than a paladin. The paladins shortly after look different than the
shadow knights. The robe wearers later on get their own special robes. Not
many people looks the same unless theyre wearing basic armor (leather,
chain, plate)

Yeah, I had a fighter with cleric skills before. Was really nice... til
around level 20, I found out that I screwed up bad because I misplaced some
starting points. I always heard of so many people doing this, around level
20, then they start over and go at it again, screw up and repeat

Yeah I made that mistake also.

EverQuest was a very nice game for me, but I think I have explored all that
I can. There is much more that I can explore still, but I would need a group
for that, and the only way i could get there is by camping stuff.
That gnoll fang quest is pretty stupid. all it is worth is exp and faction.
The better quests you can do later, but why bother - everyone farms them and
there are spoilers everywhere.

Yeah, or that 1 quest, kill olthoi, give claw to man for nice sword.

in EQ, there is a mid level quest for a cleric weapon where you have to
either fight your way into a dungeon and open a door to possibly release
vampires on you and pick up something off the ground, then hope the doors
dont shut and lock you in. I never did that quest but it looked like it
would be fun if the quester was in the level range for the quest

Youre talking about pre-AC eq, go to one of the 2 new continents, the
special mobs that drop stuff wander, the quests are better (like the dwarves
in velious raiding the giant fort), and some items are very rarely dropped
off common mobs

Yeah, I know this, cause one of them was wandering around near a town and
killed me.

Strange, I have walked from freeport to qeynos and back about 4 times when I
was level 4-7....

Yeah now you got all those neat little programs that you can alt+tab out of
AC to look at ! tells you where in Dereth you are, and you can plan the
quickest routes from 1 point to another, and it includes portal usage
Made my questing so much easier, kill those little flying things, wasps?
yeah i think that was it.. red wasp, blue wasp, green wasp, gold wasp! warp
to a town, walk to another nearby town, turn in wing. Money and exp! big
woop.

Not all classes are designed specifically for group play. I was an
enchanter, yet I was soloing about 30%-50% of the time when I couldnt get a
group.

>
> AC very easy

Yeah, lets just buy a game thats multiplayer, pay MS money, and act like its
a 1 player game...
Solo play was far from easy from my experience. I had my character focused
on physical offense, and the mobs were 5 levels lower than me. took them 1
at a time, had good equipment too btw, had some crappy buffs on (armor 2,
strengthen 2 and otehrs) and I STILL had to run away and heal, which was
always an easy escape btw

You arent very accurate. Where did you get this info from? were you really
an eq player or did you just read around what everyone else said?
BTW, you wont lose exp often if you dont solo your way up. Try making some
FRIENDS, specifically CLERIC FRIENDS. The most important thing that keeps EQ
running is its community

Yeah, then when you die because your skills were too weak to fight the
monster, your vitae goes even lower and you have to kill low level stuff for
an hour

And Cros Treewind died, Kithicor woods got invaded when Innoruuk revealed
himself, Firiona Vie was kidnapped, then she lost some of that cleavage we
all knew and loved when she went to Velious.

Arwic was also where everyone hung out if I remember right..? didnt they
want to destroy it because there were too many people?
Oh btw, while we're talking about the monthy thing, how do you feel about
those monthly long patches you have to do? I am on cable modem and it took
me around an hour, a few days after the patch came out

>
> I know i have missed somethings out but it covers the main points.

You forgot the graphics/landscape, how AC is so vast and goes on and on,
with the creatures being the same just different colors every other region,
and how it looks so bland. Then you forgot to say the usual "but EQ has
zones that you have to spend 2 WHOLE MINUTES!!! (2!!!) to load!!!!!!! that
is so STUUUUUUUPID.

then there was that part about the AC clipping plane, how you can see.. what
was it, 5 miles into the distance? Oh wait that was teh exageration from
some beta tester.

then there is the part how the monster AI is so fucking smart!
it will either igore you, or run and chase you down til you ran too far away
from his sitting point/camp fire/home, and it will either warp back over,
run faster than it was chasing you, or make a series of random
mini-teleports, and if you hit them with range attacks they usually ignore
you til they get back to their home and you get so close they agro on you
again

> Hope this helps

Yeah it did. 30 more mins down, Its almost time for me to pack up and go
