Yeah ,put Storm Giants,Diseased rats,Velium Hounds,Brontotheriums,
Highland Tigers,Heretic Invaders,Rock spiderlings,Dune spiderlings,
Ferocious Wolves,Mature Rockhoppers,Greyhoppers,Stonegazer 
Cockatrices,Kunark Rhinos,Wraits,Shardwurms,put them *all* in
EJ as long as all the other zones are not working correctly. :)

Maybe they should move *all* mobs from *all* zones to EJ,then
we would not have any longer to complain about missing mobs.  :)
This also would solve the problem of players not finding a group. :)
Add a Pok Book to EJ,all problems solved,they now can fully
concentrate on EQ 2.  :)

Note the flood of smilies  :)
