My Xnews folder is currently 3.5MB 

This includes the original ZIP file which is 700k.

Now, this is a recent reinstall because of that flakey behavior
I mentioned, and I don't know how any of the folders in there
grow.  Of the 6 folders in there, only Data and Folders have the
potential to grow - Attachments won't because I don't save attachments,
Download, and Temp are empty and I'd assume will stay so.  Internet
has a folder called Xnews which has a copy of the manual that is
also in the top Xnews directory (can probably be disposed of).

Folders will grow because archived posts get stored there - and I 
archive my sent posts in the Sent folder.  Any other folders you
add to it to store posts will also make it grow.  However, if you
don't want to save anything, this won't grow either.

Data contains files corresponding to your subscribed groups - whether
those files grow over time or not I don't know, but the folder will
get bigger as you subscribe to more newsgroups (although the files are
small, so not much bigger.)

So, at an estimate it would stay below 5MB for quite a while.
Which puts it at 1/1000th of your available space :)

http://www.webattack.com/get/xnews.html is the link.  And, like I said -
it doesn't write crap all over the registry, if you don't like it you
can simply drag the directory to the trash bin and it's out of your hair.

BTW - I feel your pain in the job search - I quit my old job to finish
school (I wasn't getting done with the time demands) and now that I'm
done I'm having a *hell* of a time.  In fact, atm I'm taking a break 
from my current round of application letters, more fun to play on usenet
for a few minutes than to make my experience/education look like a nice
fit for yet another job description.
