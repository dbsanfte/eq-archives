NO. Those don't have pixel and vertex shading.
They WON'T work for EQ2.

You need a full geforce 4 4200, 4400 or 4600, or the newer geforce FX
5800 or 5900. I am not even sure if the geforce FX 5200 has it, its
essentially the new MX. Even a Geforce 3 ti can do pixel and vertex
shading, MX models can't however (but you'd probably not want to buy
one for SWG, unless wanting a slideshow.)
