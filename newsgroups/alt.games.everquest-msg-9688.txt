That was a good one, Brat.  It always amazes me how often these
trollers think that they're some sort of geniuses for being just
dim enough to figure out, like any four-year-old, the easy
task of how to push people's buttons (but never smart enough to
figure out why they shouldn't).  Because contrary to their
overinflated opinions of their own competence, it never takes much
to lay a trap for them (semantic or otherwise) that they almost
invariably jump into with both feet.

The real funny part is that they're usually too stupid even to
understand how badly they've been outmaneuvered, and what a
laughingstock they make of themselves so many times.
