 Iksar are KOS in the outpost initially so you can scratch them off the
list. I think agnostic humans aren't kos there so probably easier to
create a human monk in FP and run to oasis, take the raft to OT then get
on the boat to OT. Unless you can only be agnostic starting in Qeynos. I
never started a Human so I don't know.  It should be just as easy to
create an evil in Neriak and run them over as well.
