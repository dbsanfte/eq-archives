This site "How to Play a Necromancer" has some good information, but the
writing and grammar is terrible and the author tends to be a bit
opinionated.  His descriptions of spells are helpful, just don't believe
everything he says about which spells are useful and which are junk.

This site has forums and a few other tidbits.

Unfortunately I haven't found a necro site that is as good as some of the
other class specific sites out there.  If anyone knows of one, I would love
to know about it.
