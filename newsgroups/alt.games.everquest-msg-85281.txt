Does this still exist?  Seriously.  I've always heard it expressed as 
gospel, but I've never seen it happen.  As a bard one of my dueling 
techniques is to dart and DoT, hit selos, run by fast and twist my DoTs on 
my opponant.  I don't duel a lot, but when I do, I use my DoTs.  I have 
never had a victim lose EXP, or at least not tell me they did.  
I'll talk to the necros in my guild, and ask if they see this, but it may 
be that nobody will duel a necro anymore.  Of course necros are nasty to 
duel in the first place, and they have that nasty habit of defiling your 
corpse after they kill you, so maybe nobody knows.  :)
If the DoT bug still exists, does it exist in all situations, or is it 
only active when whomever dotted you is no longer in the zone to get 
credit for the kill?  (I ask because I have killed literally hundreds of 
mobs with nothing other than DoTs, not a single melee hit or damage shield 
or riposte or DD, and I still got the EXP.)
