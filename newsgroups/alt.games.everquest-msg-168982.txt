    A lot of that is from the volume of heals clerics put out. With things
like Supernal Remedy a cleric can spam out a ton of fast healing, and that
just rockets you up the hate list.

    I did notice at least one mob that had CH aggro tuned too high, though.
I've never before had the problem that, after one CH 15 seconds into the
fight, I'd get beelined and smushed - but it happened with Bertox. Maybe
that's what they're talking about.
