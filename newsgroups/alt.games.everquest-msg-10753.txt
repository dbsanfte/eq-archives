One thing that really annoyed me yesterday in West Freeport was a 7th
level gnome necro.  First she was /Shouting lots for help to get to
the necro guild.  After I had been to North Freeport in the bank, she
was still /shouting, and /ooc'ing for help, and whining about not
getting any response after 1 minute.  She pestered anyone for a sow,
because she needed it for a corpse run.

After zoning to EC, I see her corpse at the tunnel (Yeah, of course
you need sow to get there, she was not even KOS to the guards), good
equipment, advisor robe, some fancy staff, and more.

Eck, helpless, spoiled, annoying little gnome...
