I like this idea. Perhaps something cinematic like being able to do 
multiple backflips away from the mob, unable to use any offensive skills 
while doing it but dramatically increasing the monk's ability to avoid 
damage. Similar to the skill Vega from Street Fighter 2 had.

Perhaps make this skill use a lot of stamina to reduce the amount of 
time this skill can be used without resting.
