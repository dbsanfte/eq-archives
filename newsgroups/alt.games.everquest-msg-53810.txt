I have been playing EverQuest for a while now. I am currently sitting at
level 21 with my druid.

I am wondering if anyone can give my some advice on making money. I am not
talking about thousands of pp or anything like that... just some average
cash. I have been fortunate enough at my current level to be able to afford
the majority of spells thus far, but that is about it.  I guess I am just
unclear about the economy of EverQuest. If anyone has some websites on the
subject or anything like that it would be grate. I have seen some websites
offer 100pp an hour and stuff like that through somekind of guide that costs
like 20 bucks, but I don't need thousands of Plat to play the game. Just
enough to comfortably buy a few spells here and there and maybe some new
pieces equipment.

Any advice would be helpful.

Thank you.

Fasgo
