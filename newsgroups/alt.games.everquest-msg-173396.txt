Without Russia the Allies would not have had the manpower to defeat
Germany on the ground at all.

Anf btw your analysis is questionable. There is no doubt the equipment
helped immensely, but the Rusiian economy wasn't crushed by the
Germans; it simply moved east. A lot more people would have died but
its unlikely Germany could ever have beaten Russia no matter what was
supplied unless Britain was defeated first and they could throw their
entire weight at them with no fear in the west. And even
then...questionable.

El Alemein 2 predates Torch. Checkyerdates, poncho. Rommel was beaten
before US troops were on the ground.

And btw, the majority of resources for Torch were British.

A part of the victory. There were keys on all sides. If any one
country could be said to have been crucial to eventual victory, it
would be Russia, but that is not chic to say in the West.

And where the heck have you been, no Khosh sighting on Test in many
days now....
