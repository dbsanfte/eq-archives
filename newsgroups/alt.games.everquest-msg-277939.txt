Hiya, Jake & son!

I just read your post...

Way back in September 1999, I started playing EQ with my son when he was 8 
and a half. We still do and we've come a long way together.

We started out as a warrior-cleric duo to give him a feel for the game (not 
to belittle the complexity of playing a warrior, but it is quite 
straightforward and he could handle it). Then we tried a few other 
combinations : from SK-shaman, to monk-druid and a couple more 'creative' 
combinations with me always playing the back-up role and Max playing the 
mel�e or 'offence' character.

Things went well and he learned fast (and luckily so did I !!!) and we 
started grouping with others. Sometimes we told others he was a youngster, 
sometimes we didn't. The thing is, when he played well and didn't make any 
mistakes, people quickly forgot his age and group banter often got a tad 
more 'grown-up' than I'd wished...

However, he took it all in stride and sometimes asked team mates to watch 
their language. Usually, all graciously complied and even apologized.

Then we both joined a low-level guild and didn't quite like the atmosphere 
though it had more to do with inner power struggles than anything else - we 
did make tons of friends though. We left and tried two others only to find 
the same bickering everywhere.

Finally, we both started a beastlord and duo'ed those to the 61 and 62 and 
still play them. We've built up a network of friends we still group with and 
still duo our old characters. We've met other kid-parent teams and many 
spouse teams, many of which took my son into their groups if I couldn't log 
on (when he turned 10, he was allowed to play alone *if* he could join up 
with one of our adult friends whom we trusted, otherwise, it was expected 
that he camp out unless he was fishing, tradeskilling or soloing).

With our constant EQ-talk during family reunions, one of my sisters took up 
the game (and later started another account to play with her sons) and two 
of my brothers also joined in the fun so we often have a full group between 
the bunch of us.

In any case, I've absolutely loved our 'guy' time together over the years, 
moreso that winter up here in Montr�al is looooong and I hate to ski. I 
found our time on-line together invaluable since it was *our* fun time, our 
special treat, it didn't cost much (compared to movies, sporting events or 
what not) and allowed us to talk a *lot* about 'stuff' and life in general. 
And to explore different musical realms - we take turns at picking the music 
to which we listen while we play: my job is to expose him to what I like (or 
know) while he has the mandate of finding out about the 'new' stuff. So, now 
that I know who The Mooney Suzukis, Nine-Inch Nails, The Red Hot Chili 
Peppers, Dears, Chromeo, Simple Plan and Stills are, he's listened to 
everything from Aznavour to Zappa and back.

Furthermore, as a french-speaking family, we've both greatly improved our 
English!

Throughout, he remained involved in sports, the usual kid activities and had 
his chores, grades and responsibilities to see to before we play(ed), but it 
just made our gaming time that much more valuable to him.

My (recent) better half, of course, finds the whole virtual world thing 
rather silly (''So, guys, you both off to go act tough and beat on monsters 
again?''), but can't deny that it's done wonders in helping my son and I to 
build and maintain a truly exceptionnal relationship, one that will 
undoubtedly last for a very long time. (Note : she isn't my son's mom, his 
real mom left when he was three and we haven't heard of her since then). So 
much so that my main squeeze has asked that her own son (12) be worked into 
the rotation during the weeks he stays with us (1 in 2 he spends with his 
father). He plays much less than my son because he has a bit of trouble in 
school and school always comes first, but my sweetheart finally admits and 
realizes the good it's done to my son and I. It's just too darn bad she 
doesn't want to start playing herself...

Our two-coppers worth of, er, 'advice' : Go for it and have fun!

Safe travels and good hunting to you both,


zbip de Montr�al & son
