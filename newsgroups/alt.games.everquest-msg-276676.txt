GMs are not Guides and Guides are not GMs.  GMs are paid customer 
service reps.  Guides are an all volunteer "quest troupe" team.  Guides 
used to respond to petitions, but this was changed last year and they 
now only do (pre-scripted) quests and events.  GMs do not have authority 
over the Guide program and vice versa.

Guide accounts (Apprentice Guides, Guides, Senior Guides, Elder Guides) 
do not have the ability or power to spawn NPCs directly, nor summon 
(create) items.  The scroll you mentioned above was created by a Game 
Developer for a specific event.  When inspected by the Guide, it 
triggers a pre-made script on the server, which can do various things, 
including spawn NPCs.  (The scrolls triggering pre-made scripts only 
happen on EQ2 at this time, not EQ1)

GM accounts (many different various levels) do have the ability to spawn 
NPCs and summon items, given they are logging on from inside the SOE 
network.  Outside the network they have roughly the same abilities as a 
Guide.  While their accounts have the *ability* to do such things, their 
*policy* prohibits them from taking actions.

Every priveliged command issued by a GM (and Guide) account is logged by 
the server, which regularly emails reports to a Lead GM or a Guide 
program administrative team, depending on the account type.  Thus, a GM 
(and Guide) will usually not take any action outside their respective 
policies.

As an aside, GMs are seperated by a number of Tiers.  Most of the Tier 1 
staff is located in India.  Tier 1 are the people who will usually 
respond to you first through the petition system.  Tier 2 staff is in 
India/UK.  Tier 3 staff is in San Diego.

The more complex your issue is (more policy/decision power it requires), 
the higher the Tier it needs to go.  (example: Character Restore 
requests are usually done by San Diego)

Any clearer?
