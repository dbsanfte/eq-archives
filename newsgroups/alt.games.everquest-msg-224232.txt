I think both partners been enthusiastic is the most important thing. For
example: Life with a Luddite normally entails coming home from work, helping
with dinner and the dishes and when they sit down to watch TV nicking off to
the computer room. Within minutes:

"The garbage needs taking out"
"Can you help proof read my assignment"
"Why don't you read a book"
"The place could do with a vacuum"  (at 9pm at night mind you)
...etc.

One day I finally sat (a now "Ex") down and asked her why she always finds
things to do whenever I sit in front of the computer, and what happened to
her TV watching? The resulting answer:

"It is a shame to see you sitting down doing nothing for such long periods"

Nothing?

I lived with a Thai girl for 18 months and she viewed the computer as a
similar waste of time but she was a whole lot nicer about getting me away
from it. She would just come in the computer room naked and sit on my lap.
You can only try playing EQ for so long with a squirming naked girl trying
their best to block your view of the monitor..

"Sorry guys gotta log, the GF is... well... *ponders how credible excuse
will sound* ... um ... telling me I gotta mow the lawn. Yeah, thats it, and
weed the garden too"

Once when she was watching me type I would add on "I should be back in two
minutes" for a stir, but only once as she threatened to wash my keyboard
again. <---not a typo unfortunately.
