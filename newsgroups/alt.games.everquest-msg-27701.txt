    Is that the warrior with the Cowl? What IS his AC, anyways? Haste %?
Weapons? I'm guessing he had a bit more going for him over that full group
than just shaman slowing. ;-)

    Next section has considerable snippage. In general, if you see a gap,
the statements weren't related.

    The first three really argue against the fourth, you know. If landing
Turgur is so powerful that it "gimps" a mob, I'd argue Turgur and slowdown
percentages in general are the broken part of EQ. The shaman has to land it
ONCE, and the mob is taken care of for the next two minutes - ample time to
debuff to ensure all the later Turgurs land, too. Don't know any slowable
boss mobs that require only one CHeal on the focus per two minutes, slowed
or not. The game designers are even upping mob attack rates and mob resist
tables in REACTION to Turgur's, for crying out loud! The only time they've
had to design around CHeal was when it was available for free from Donal's
BP. If you want to say a spell is broken beyond words, point a finger at
slowdowns.
