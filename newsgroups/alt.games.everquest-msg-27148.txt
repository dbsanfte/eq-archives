You can call it bullshit if you want, but by Verant's rules, yes, whoever
engages the mob first, is the one who gets it.  Period.  If you the camper
then takes the mob, by Verant's rules you are KSing.  If you, the camper,
petitions, it will get you nowhere.  If the person taking the mob is KSed by
you, they can petition, and will probably prevail, so long as the /report
with the relevant part of the log.  OTOH you are right, there are unwritten
accepted conventions in the game.  If someone, or some guild, goes around
taking other people's camps, they will develop a reputation that will be
detrimental to them in the long run.  Generally speaking, camps are
respected, because you never know when you will be on the other end.  It's
that golden rule thing.
