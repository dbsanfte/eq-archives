Hi all,

Lately its been impossible to find a group (for some reason people
think BSTs don't made adequate tanks or DPS even at this low level
range on FV...) so I've been soloing a lot. Currently, I'm in
Jaggedpine doing Basilisks and they give just about 1% or about 1.2%
XP per kill at level 38. Are there any other zones that are good to
solo in?

Thanks.
