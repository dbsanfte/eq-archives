For the record:  I'm in the habit of setting up new email addresses when I 
just -have- to put an email address on some account thingy somewhere.  The 
address I used to sign up for EQ and for Allahazam's premium service 
remain spam-free.

On the other hand, the email address I post to USENET from... and the one 
I used to register for EBay... Thse seem to be my two main sources of 
spam.  But I did sign up for Ebay in a stupid way so it may not be 
entirely their fault.
