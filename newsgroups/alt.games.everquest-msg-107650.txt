If it was a 20% disparity I would not think it out of whack. For instance
jboots are within 20% of the speed of a druids sow. For instance a clerics
NUKES are within 20% of a druids(actually closer to 10% till the very high
levels)

If druid healing was within 20% I would have no beef. As someone recently
pointed out cheal is a lvl 39 cleric spell . It can and does frequently heal
over 5000 points of health for 400 mana. This is a healing ratio of 12.5
health points per mana. At this level both druids and shamans the only
racial healers for wood elves, barabarians, iksar , ogres , trolls , and
perhaps even kerrans :) can heal 300 dammage for 150 mana a ratio of 2 . In
other words a druid of that level heals 16% as well as a cleric can.
