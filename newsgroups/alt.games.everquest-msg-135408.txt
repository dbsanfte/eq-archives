 There will be people who tell you the new UI obsoletes /hitsmode. Just
smack em. I filter hits out to another window so I don't have to pay
attention to them and so I don't miss anything in the chat section. Now,
I need to look in both places. Anyone notice Enrage is displayed in
melee window? That's going to get a few killed.
