Thats bull.

When trak was a priority for my guild (VP) we monopolised the spawn, killing
probably 9 in 10 pops till we were done.
Same for VS when we needed his legs

That was a year before MB..  how did MB change it, other than actual numbers
required?
We still had VS dead within 10 mins of server up, Trak dead within an hour
