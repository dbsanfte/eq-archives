Conclusion
========
- Druids have the biggest ice nuke in game! Even has higher nuke effiency
than magicians! (bolts aside) WTG!
- Druids have the biggest AoE nuke in game! WTG! Totally
u-n-b-e-l-i-e-v-a-b-l-e!
- Wizards most efficient nuke comes from Velious expansion (ADoI is the
highest in game). They don't get any upgrades in PoP. (Sidenote: Shock of
Magic can once in a blue moon top everything at 3000 damage making a
DMG/Ratio of 5. Goodluck on that btw, since it can also hit for only 1200
damage, making an average of 2100 damage only).

I know alot of you will say, stop this class comparisson/envy thing. Think
about if Enchanters could outmelee Monks, would you just say "oh i dont
wanna comment it, its just class envy"... LOL wake up.
But imho, SOE has made some grave mistakes to the class balance issues in
PoP. Druids should not outnuke magicians or wizards period. Seems that VI
did a much better job than SOE did. Did SOE do this just to please the
majority of their customers? Everyone has a druid character... but this is
getting abit out of line. Dr00dz everywhere, dr00dz get everything, dr00dz
can use everything. Seems they might aswell make a complete new game called
"Druids Online".

Next month we will be looking at why druids can't wear plate armor and if
they should start /bug reporting it.


U know u luv me...
UbeR.. ok guys, start the flame... :-)
