No. The dumbing down was a real issue. The problem is you can't go
back now that you've done it. The playerbase has changed and laziness
set in, and now too many people think that if they're not grinding or
raiding they're wasting time or there's too much "downtime".

It's too late to go back to what EQ was like before now. They tried to
do so with GoD and that was a mistake. An expansion like GoD might
have been great back before PoP (ignoring the balance and technical
issues). Would definately have been better received.

 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
