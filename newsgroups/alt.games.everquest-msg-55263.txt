The specific error you are getting is important.

If you are getting an error saying the key is invalid, then you are typing
it in wrong somehow, or using the wrong number.  I don't have mine in front
of me right now, so I can't offer advice on that at the moment.

If you are getting an error saying the key is already in use, then someone
used it, and returned the game to the store.

Either way, Verant does have a customer service number you can call, I'm
sure it's in the documentation you have somewhere, call them, open til 5pm
PST I think.

Good luck
