Maybe but if I am to kill things that I won't need any healing at all
for anyways (needing healing negates the point) the experience will be
negligible, especially now.

Fist of Karana isn't exactly what you call a "fine touch". Between the
four mobs they're likely to have a couple thousand hp left (any less
and FoK would be killing them), and none of the mobs will be running,
either because they are rooted or because they are near enough to each
other to be social. I suppose I could keep a second AE memmed
(lightning blast is the next lower down I think, been a VERY long time
since I used that) and use it to nickel them a bit. It's a possibility
and maybe I can do that with some practice but it doesn't seem likely
right off the bat. I will probably try it to see if its feasible once
I decide on a place to quad, though. It's been a long time since the
druid came out of retirement and actually hunted for exp....

Grouping is an entirely different situation. :-p My groups don't HAVE
downtime. I don't like downtime in groups, it means the group is
pulling over its head. The puller should be able to control their pull
to the extent that everyone is just keeping up, or slightly falling
behind, in their mana. If that means pulling four at a time in ME or
just one at a time in UP, then so be it.

In any event the question was only for when I can't find groups. I
infinately prefer grouping, it was always better experience in the
right situation but nowadays its grossly better.
