Steve has good advice for completing the run.  I am just going to add
that they made a change recently (Update 4 maybe?), where if a mob is
aggro and red to you ungrouped, it will still be agro to you while
grouped.  They added that to keep the high levels from graying out
zones like you were trying to do.

Just keep running, make sure you are drinking something, and sprint
when you need.  Don't stop, don't look back.  Nek can be a scary place.
