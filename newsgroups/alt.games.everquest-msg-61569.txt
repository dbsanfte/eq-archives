Ummm, that's completely backwards.

Increase the damage output of your melees and you've turned a hard
encounter into a trivial one.  There's a reason why guilds farmed the
shit outta Sleepers for primal weapons before clearing ToVN.

Infact, if you go and look at the really tough mobs in the game and
look at their characteristics carefully, you see one common theme:
They screw your melee damage output tremendously.

Some mobs do it by using nasty as fuck AoEs, others do it by having
extremely high AC.

Flowing thought is largely a bone tossed to casters.

FT 1 is one mana regen every 6 seconds.  To get enough mana back to
cast one remedy, you have wait 17 and a half MINUTES!

The highest FT item so far looted is off Tunare at FT 5.  To cast one
complete heal with 5 mana regen, you have to wait 8 minutes!  Against
a Vulak fight, you MIGHT be able to get enough mana from FT 5 item to
cast it once (as most Vulak fights now last between 10 to 15 mins).

Given the stupidly difficult hoops you have to jump through to get FT
items, the effect is really, REALLY weak.

While every little bit does help, there needs to be some sort of
balance between effort vs. reward.  FT items don't balance at all.
