 You could probably wander Nurga unmolested if you use invis. I'm fairly
certain nothing in there sees invis but I can't swear to it. If it does
drop you could probably handle anything that aggroes. Droga is also safe
with Invis but if it drops and you get aggro you'd probably end up dead,
with a fun corpse recovery. 

 You could probably wander upper guk. If you haven't killed any frogs
you should be non-kos to the frogs. Crocs and Spiders may attack you but
they shouldn't be a problem. Again, invis works well here.

 Runnyeye should be fairly safe. They like to swarm although I don't
know if they'd attack or not.

 Those are a few to start with. I'd probably visit upper guk first. Paw
is a place to stay away from though, since past the bridge I think most
things see invis. Permafrost is also another green-swarm aggro place.
Basically if a dungeon has goblins in it, Verant screwed it up with
excessive greenie aggro.
