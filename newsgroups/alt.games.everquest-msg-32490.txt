After you installed DX8 did you install the very latest video and sound
drivers as well?  If not, do that & see if it helps.

Lots of people (myself included) are using DX8.  So, although installing it
may have messed you up it would be because of something else being wrong
before upgrading...or perhaps something happened while you were upgrading.
But with any luck updating the drivers mentioned above will take care of it.

Another of the more obvious suggestions would be to hit the Thorough File
Check button on the patch screen.
