This has nothing to do with the discussion. EQ is running away from.
He wanted to discuss with me a policy he claims BB-BS of America Inc.
has re: protecting children from sexual abuse.   He failed to produce
such a policy though.  I informed him that I would not debate a policy
without seeing

(a) that it did exist, and
(b) what it specifically stated

At this point EQ ran off, being unable to back up his claims.
Shouldn't be that hard to quote a policy document!

"Practicing homosexuals" huh?   Am I any less gay if I don't need the
practice anymore?   ROTFLMAO
