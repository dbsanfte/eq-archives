It means they have *something* to hide.

If that were true then Israel would be encouraging everyone to
come and see.

Why do you support Israel? Did you support Iraq when they occupied
Kuwait? Did you support aparthied South Africa? Do you support
China occuping Tibet? Do you support the USA occuping Hawaii?
Do you support Zimbabwe? 

What makes Israel different from any of the other cases in recent
history of a nation throwing it's weight around offensivly?

Would you change your position if the PA were to adopt a flag
including the stars & strips and the star of David?

Utter rubbish, only those doing the beseigeing can stop it. 
Unless those beseiged have allies powerful enough to strike
down those besiegieing them.
