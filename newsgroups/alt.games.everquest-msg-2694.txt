I was hunting the froglock guards in the guk entrance today, and killing
fishermen and fungus man trackers outside inbetween spawns. I hate the
camera angle fighting on the slope, and don't like fighting in the
water, so after ganking the guards, I decided to pull a fisherman up
into the guk entryway where it's nice and flat. I hit one, pulled it,
and as I crossed the threshold, my autoattack kicked off. I turned
around, and the fisherman who had been hot on my tail was not there. I
assumed either somebody else popped it, or it just wandered off. 
  But when I tried it again, with no other PC's in the area, the same
thing happened. I ran back out an looked around, but the froglack
fisherman was *gone*!  Is this a bug? Or is there some reason you're not
supposed to be able to pull to that alcove?
