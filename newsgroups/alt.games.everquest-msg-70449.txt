I have Geforce 3 on Win2k, similar problem. Not a "HUGE" deal, but can cause
problems, only happenes every 4-6 hours of play time. Everything just locks,
the background music continues to play. This is usually caused by bus timing
errors on the video card, or the video card not getting an IRQ assigned. In
this case, its probably some timing errors with the new Nvidia XP drivers
and DX8.1.
