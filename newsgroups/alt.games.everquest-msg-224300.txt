You're missing my point. I don't feel *anyone* should continue burning 
through DoT's with no compensation. I never said nor meant to imply that. 
I said, "If [compensation] doesn't happen early, then you're in the wrong 
pickup group." I meant at that point you have every right to bail on 
them. 

Yes, clerics *do* deserve appropriate compensation. Like I said, if your 
groupmates aren't willing to pony up enough pp to pay for the dots, then 
you're in the wrong group.
