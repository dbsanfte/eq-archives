I agree that you are probably still too low to make the trip to Kunark.  I
would hang around wheeever you are hunting until you get to around lvl 20.
Once you are lvl 20, head to the Lake of Ill Omen.  A lot of ppl go there,
but it is easy to get into groups and you will lvl like mad all the way to
around 30.
