Well, he is a ranger, and they're pretty good at pulling trains too.  It 
does bring back memories of the first time I was really impressed with an 
enchanter.  Was whatever level was appropriate for the pyramid, in a full 
group, and just cleaning the place up.  After a couple spawn cycles of 
clearing the lower levels and then rushing to the top killing as we moved, 
we decided to just stay down below and pull everything down.  The puller 
seemed to think it meant EVERYTHING.  I just saw a wall of mobs coming, 
enchanter hits 'em with AE mez, and we just picked 'em off one by one.  At 
that point I truly understood the value of crowd-control.

luckily saw that I was getting mez song soon
