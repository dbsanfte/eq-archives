It helps a lot. Thanks to you and to the other posters.  I plan on
trying to load EQ on the laptop as soon as I rebuild it and take the
Linux partition off - need the space - so I can try it out.  The
laptop is actually quite new, but it is an ultraportable and thus
rather stripped down.  I already confimed the power supply is dual
voltage and bought the world travel plug kit.

I will be staying in hotels from what I understand.  I'll be taking a
course remotely, so I have already asked about internet at the hotels.
I have been assured that the hotels I will be staying in will have
broadband, but since most hotels in the US that have broadband don't
charge, I stupidly assumed the same would be true.  Well, I'll have
the laptop with me anyway; if it works, it works, if not - no big
deal.

I should be spending my time getting to know the country anyway, but
as a low paid intern, I was hoping to use this for some cheap
entertainment during the week.

Thanks again to you and the other posters for the help.
