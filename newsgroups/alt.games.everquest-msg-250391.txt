Its not really as slow as you say. You solo 20 percent slower than the
base races, so you solo 1/5 slower. That means that if it took bob 60
minutes to gain X amount of experience, it takes you 12 minutes more.

If it takes bob 50 hours to get through one bubble of level 55, it
would take you 60 hours. That is if you were both soloing beastlords. 
The thing is, no beastlord is base xp.

Barbarian is minus 5 or 10 percent (heard both)

Ogre is minus 15

Iksar and troll are minus 20

Vah shir might be base, or probably is the same as the barbarian since
it is essentially a barbarian in a kitty suit, with slightly higher
dex/agil and no racial slam (and slightly less str/sta if I remember
right.) 

The issue is that you regen hit points twice as fast, while you gain
xp 1/5 slower. So it is basically a fair trade if getting hit much
would be slowing you down. Of course, as a beastlord you probably have
your pet tanking more so its not a big issue, so you could say you are
playing a 1/5 penalty that you never use. In that case, I hope you
really like being an iksar. 

For that reason, all things considered, I'd only be a vah shir
beastlord. Besides having a small penalty, if any, you still have
infra. However, if vah shir is 5 percent you are only leveling 15
percent slower. Its not REALLY that big a deal.
