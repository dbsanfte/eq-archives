The amount of xp you get is based on several things, the level of the mob, 
and the zone you are in are two big factors.  Dark blue mobs can vary in 
level quite a bit, anywhere from one level lower than you to 15(?) levels 
lower than you.  Some mobs are indeed more difficult, even if the same or 
lower level than mobs that you can easily kill.

You are a shaman, you have SoW, you outrun those mobs.  We just discussed 
where a close zone point is, Crystal Caverns.  Alternatively, outrun the 
mobs to the bridge and zone into Iceclad, or gate out.

But, you are right, I would suggest you just head back to Crushbone, you 
are pretty safe there.

Snipping is your friend.
