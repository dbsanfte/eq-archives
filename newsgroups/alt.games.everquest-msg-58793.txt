 I regularly group with a few friends in places like Sirens Grotto,
Dragon Necropolis and Skyshrine (other side of the maze) and none of
them happen to be a cleric while one of them happens to be a shaman.
True, the slow effect sucks but it's only 24 seconds so, when combined
with the mob being slowed, it's not that bad. Snare effect? Like melees
care. Where do they need to go? The only thing that sucks about being
snared is getting summoned since you can't back up.

 Dick waving? I don't know. A 200 mana savings and a larger heal (222hp
more) seems rather significant to me. CHeal is nice, if you happen to
have a cleric but that's not always the case. Then again it's not always
the case you have a level 60 shaman nearby, so...

 Maybe he went to VP and got a snare weapon. Those things are great!

 If my group wants to fight constant mobs, and those are my only two
choices for healer. I'd take the shaman. Every time. I have nothing
against Druids since I play one myself on occassion. It's simply a
matter of Shaman being more efficient in certain instances.
