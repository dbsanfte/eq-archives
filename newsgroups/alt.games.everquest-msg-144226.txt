Way to rainy to stay long or give much of a report. I took whatever was not
nailed down, including stickers, promotional game copies, a t-shirt, some
buttons and a few pencils. I did not win any of the prizes but I was there
only like 30mins as it was pouring and I had to get back to work. People
were nice both from the staff and the other players. Some guy kept on
hasseling one of the PR guys with shit like, "Why is it always snowing in
the Eastern Wastes?" and the guy kept on being like, "Dude, I am only a PR
guy." All I could think about was the Simpsons, the episode where Lucy
Lawless has to receive those questions from the fans or the one with Homer
as Poochie. "What does someone with Genius at Work on their shirt have so
many stupid questions?" Well, thats the long and tall of it fellow EQ'ers
