I remember when I *contracted* my first set of  banded armor when people traded
in EC.  I met the guy and watched as he made each piece in Freeport.  It was
great fun and worth a plat per armor class, (if I recall correct).  
I don't try to *tradeskill* for money anymore.  My shaman finally got to where
she could make SoW potions.  It costs her about 12 plat each to make them / 120
per 10 dose.  They sell regularly now in the bazaar for 78 PP per 10 dose.  
Making arrows for profit is the same way.  
I'm always amazed when someone comments on the "profitability" of
tradeskilling.  It's not really profitable until you get to a high level of
proficiency, and by that time you don't care about making 5 plat profit on 20
arrows because you aren't going to get any *skillups* making them anyway and
it's boring.  
I only tradeskill for my personal satisfaction.
