PotG has identical mana regen and 170 more hitpoints. Downside is 6
less AC and that you can't stack hero/aego with it, but it most
certainly is not blown out of the water as a mana regen buff.

Yesterday as I was farming some velium before bed, I clicked off my
Aego from a raid so I could cabbage. I was missing the mana regen.
