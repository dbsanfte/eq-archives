Yep, in Children of Dune.  I was hesitant at first to accredit the quote to 
Frank Herbert because Herbert accredits it to a fictional character in the 
book... but I'll just accredit it to Herbert after all.

-- 
"Atrocity is recognized as such by victim and perpetrator alike, by all
who learn about it at whatever remove. Atrocity has no excuses, no
mitigating argument. Atrocity never balances or rectifies the past.
Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-
perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
