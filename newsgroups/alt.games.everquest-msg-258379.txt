Oh come on.  You'd have to increase it by 500% before it would be 
competitive with melee.  Is there a point to this?  Throwing is for 
pulling.  Increase the -range- not the damage!

By how much?  How many ranks of it are they adding?  How much does this 
cost?  I think this is a mistake, Frenzy damage should be first simply 
increased, then increase further by itemization similar to the pet focus 
items, so that you can differentiate frenzy damage by which tier of item 
you have.

Frenzy is, at the high end, the most broken part of the class, and I'd 
like to see a more serious effort to fix it than plugging in another AA 
of unspecified degree.

Since nobody ever uses the damned things in anything other than an exp 
group, and then more as a joke than anything serious, its hard to see 
why we'd care.  Fix the ability so it doesn't screw everyone else's disc 
timers and then we'll talk.

Since a miss aggros just as well as a hit, who cares whether they hit or 
not?

Funny.  Word "chance" begs the question "how large"

I'm a long way yet from sprint ability, but it seems silly compared to 
just getting run 3 and not worrying about it any more.  Faster than mobs 
  is faster than mobs.

This should be a class ability, not something added with AA

This one too.  But can it be turned on and off?  If not, I might not 
ever take it, as thus far I've found I end up as MT more often than not, 
not to mention soloing a fair amount of my life away.  If its 
switchable, though, great, because on those rare occaisions when I find 
a MT who can hold aggro off me, I'd love to be able to throw more power 
into DPS and to heck with the defenses I'm not using anyway.

Stop it.  Just stop it.  Fix ability, THEN worry about how good it is.

OK, some details would be nice, but again I think a mistake not to do 
this via itemization.

Hmm.

OK, nice when I'm MT, but how much does it increase by?  From the front 
estimate 15% reduction in DPS due to mob defenses; if this is good for 
10% increase in chance thats a 1.5% DPS increase... while attacking from 
the rear is a 15% increase that costs no AA at all.

I thought we already mentioned this one?

Heh, funny, but I might like this one.  Sounds like it scales with the 
'zerker's gear too, which is a big complaint we've had about frenzy.
