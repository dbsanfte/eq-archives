I tried this quest today and tried the double round technique..
But when i gathered the final item and combined the vendor would not let me
buy another of the item.
The vendor in question was the coldain Terman Underbelly.
Have they changed the quest now so that you cannot do double rounds or it
only this vendor of the 6 that does this?
