*shrug*
So you ran into a jerk.  Who hasn't?  The "for donations" thing was
argued and ranted to death years ago.  It's history.  In EQ it just
isn't a synonym for "free will offering".  I used to get just as
irritated at it as you are now, but eventually it becomes pointless
to argue something like this.

Sorry man, old news.  You aren't going to get any further with this
than I and a few others have gotten railing against the nonsense of
saying "I could care less" when you mean "I could NOT care less".

It's not a con when it's common usage.  In EQ "for donations" is the
most common way to advertise a service for hire.  There's no deception
involved, just jargon that isn't 100% identical to "real life".  It's
not like "real life" isn't full of euphemisms as well.
