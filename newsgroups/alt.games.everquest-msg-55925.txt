Only be on PvP servers "if" it goes live. Testing it out now. Monsters do
not need food and drink and you can not save a monster yet. Who knows where
it will go. The monster you play is random from level 1 to 14 and you will
have all that the monster is capable of using. Spells, weapons, etc. Only
thing I see now is some monsters can bash without a shield and as of right
now when you play one you can not bash. I sent in a petition on that
already. Also I would like to see a monster option file. PITA to reconfigure
buttons every time you play one.

Best one I have played so far is a drowning citizen in Freeport. When you
spawn as one you have to swim up fast as you start drowning right away. When
you work your way out of the tunnels to the newbie area all mayhem breaks
loose. The guards will not kill you as you beat on the newbies. As a matter
of fact if they fight back near the guards the guards beat on them. Totally
evil..... Bwhuahahahahahaha }:)

Also some XP problem also. You do not get XP if you kill a player controlled
monster that normally would give you XP and as a monster players do not give
you XP. Be careful if you start with a monster that has a weapon because if
you deequip it you can not reequip it. =(
