Yes, since you get more primary swings than secondary, you'll get more
chances for a skill increase. If your hand to hand is really poor, then it
will severely nuke your damage output. Solution: Go someplace level
appropriate, with either bare hands or a pair of fast h2h weapons, and ask
a group there if you could beat on their pulls for skill. No risk of you
KSing them, and it'll raise skill without a huge risk of death because you
aren't doing enough damage.
