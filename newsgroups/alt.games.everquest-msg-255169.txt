Given the number of people on this thread alone that agreed, I seriously 
wonder about that. I got bored within the first 30 days. It wasn't just 
the lack of content, hell I probably saw maybe 5% of the content! It is 
that there is simply no reason to fight beyond your initial push to get 
yoru base powers. What's more, you only get new powers every other 
level, meaning that you really have to gain 2 levels to even have the 
opportunity to do something new (ignoring the fact that at either 32 or 
35 there is a skip of more than 2 levels, IIRC).

One of the draws of the MMORPG is loot, plain and simple. Whether it is 
player crafted loot, static loot, or random loot, loot is central to the 
experience. Moreover, with loot in the game, it gives you a ton of 
additional questing options that just don't exist in CoH. In CoH your 
quest is basically: go kill X of these. Sure, they'll butter it up with 
"rescue this hostage". But what does that really mean? It means, go kill 
all the creatures in a particular location so the NPC you are "rescuing" 
can run away, with no chance of him dying (at least in any of the quests 
I did).

Again, I think CoH is *fun*. But it is fun like Quake3 or Battlefield 
1942 is. It is not something I (and it appears a lot of people) am will 
to pay 15/mo for.

The only way they can add the sort of content it needs would be with an 
entire rewrite of the game. People on the boards are already trying to 
come up with ways to add loot and/or crafting. Why? For depth. Once they 
realize that the core game isn't changing, they'll move on too.
