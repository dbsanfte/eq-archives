I hope that's true...I fear it isn't, though.  Velious is an enchanter's
nightmare compared to any other continent and according to a couple others
who post here, when it comes to boss critter raids, it's  "enchanter, buff
me then get the hell out of the zone."  If that's the actual case it
continues to argue for alteration.

But I won't know for sure for another year or so...or whenever I get up to
level 58 from 52 (it took me 2 months to get through level 51).
