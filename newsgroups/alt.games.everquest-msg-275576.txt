My character is level 44 now, but I still keep getting guild writs to
kill goblins in Runnyeye from the Baron in the WFP militia house.  I
am sick of RE and don't want to do writs there.  How do I get past
this?  Is there someone else I can get higher level writs from without
messing up faction?  Thanks for any help.
