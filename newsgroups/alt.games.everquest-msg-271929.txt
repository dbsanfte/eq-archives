Are they Timberclaw gnolls though? I remember doing the quest that the 
poster is talking about and I couldnt solo it. I had to group to complete 
it. With fewer low level players around to help these sort of quests are 
becoming too difficult.

I'm also amazed that SOE have made it even more difficult to solo mob 
groups. What happened to the promise of more content for solo players? It 
seems they are obsessed with making people play in groups.

I'm enjoying myself so far in EQ2 but there a huge amount of problems with 
it. If it wasnt due to the fact that WoW isnt out in the UK yet I would have 
quit last month.
