Actually, I was going to suggest that when I first read this thread.
There's almost no end to the sick amount of shit a pair of necros can
do. Back when I was playing mine, even in the teens and early twenties,
teaming up with my wife's necro we were damned near unstoppable.  Now
that I've seen the 49+ Necro pets in action, it's just...

/shudder

Sick. Totally sick. I can only imagine five necros in a group wandering
around most anywhere. Not many places they couldn't go. Crowd control,
even some healing, later on rez ability if needed. Chain casting pets
who can solo sea furbies. Sheesh.
