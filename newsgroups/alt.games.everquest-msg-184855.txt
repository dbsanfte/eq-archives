Yes, as all sellers of snake-oil should be.

And don't think I've forgotten about your claim
that no EQ player has ever committed suicide
without blaming EQ.

I've got a big "told you so" letter waiting for
the blanks to be filled in as soon as I find the
right obituary.

>> I also don't think a warning label would do anything.

It couldn't hurt, and a warning about the game
being addictive  to some people would be accurate.

Its always been a bit of a selling point to me, if
the game review mentions that it is addictive.
