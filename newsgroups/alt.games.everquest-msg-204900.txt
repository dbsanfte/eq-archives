I'm a woman who plays EQ and I'm offended by that remark.  "cyboring" is 
not something I've ever done and when I've come across it I was quick to 
grab enough for my petition I sent in complaining about it.  Now, I do 
chat, how else do you find people to group with?  If you don't talk at 
all, I don't know who will want you in groups.  Being cute?  no clue 
what you mean by that.
Just because a character is male don't assume the person behind him is a 
  male, I run my hubby's characters all the time.  My preference is to 
always play females.  My son sometimes will make female characters so 
assuming every female is played by a female is wrong too.
