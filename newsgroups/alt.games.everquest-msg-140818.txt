If you are not playing any class past the low 20's then maybe you just lack
the patience it takes to really enjoy EQ.  You are missing out on the fun
part, because that's when you stop chasing "bats" and start to really get
into more of a class strategy/tactics and group/raid type of stuff.   Every
class has it's strengths and weaknesses and reasons why people like to play
them, but I think you will have to play one a little higher to really decide
if you enjoy the class or not.

I play a rogue, shaman, necro and SK and I LOVE them all.  Right now I am
really hooked on my necro because I found a GREAT soloing spot for her and
I'm getting exp again YEAH!

Also, it's not just the class, but where you are playing.  If you are doing
the standard exp grind, the game will get boring.
