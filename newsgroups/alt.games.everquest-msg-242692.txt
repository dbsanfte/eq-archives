Thanks to everyone's help here, I have been grouping some and it is funner
to fight a red /conned MOB then running for the boarder.  :)
Last night I was grouped with Kim, and someone from her bind point wanted to
join the group.  Kim and I were both 10s and the new member, Tuma,  was only
lvl 1.  Someone else joined our group, don't remember their name, and said
Tuma was too young to be in our group and would not gain XP from being in
our group.  I would think Tuma would have leveled even quicker since every
MOB would be red to him even if they were light blue to us.
If this was true about being too young, could someone explain it to me.  I
know Tuma could not be the tank of the group, but any help agains blues,
whites and yellows would always be welcome.

PS  I dropped from the group and watched over Tuma in Freeport, being the
good Cleric and casting a few heals when he dropped near half.  It gave me a
chance to increase my meditaion and practice casting.  (plus I was hoping
for a few tails to sell but not dropped)
