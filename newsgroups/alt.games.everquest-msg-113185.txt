While the list concept is debatable, I'm hoping for the sake of the 62
clerics
ahead of me on that list, some of whom have been there for 9 months being
good members of the community (not ganking) that it isn't scrapped, although

doing so would doubtless benefit me.

If there is no list, the problem actually remains the same; there is one
ragefire
every 3 days, and a new cleric ready for epic (I'm talking all steps prior
to
Ragefire done) every two days.  Regardless of their being a "list" or not,
the
average time per cleric will still be 9 months, and still grow at 3 days per
week
Sure, a cleric freshly ready for epic may now get his in three days if he
can out-gank
every other cleric out there, but that just bumps everyone else down 3 days
or
so longer before they get theirs.

Who benefits from a list?  The clerics who aren't in Uber guilds, thats who.

One of the more seedy phenomenum EQ creates is the rampant defection
to higher level guilds as we level up; instead of encouraging us to stay
with
our established friends and help them as a community, killing the list
concept
would only accelerate this tendancy.  On Morell Thule, clerics are generally

team players who respect all the other clerics out there.  While this
attitude
goes against the grain for the high priests of Innoruk, other than that its
nice
to see.

Bergh Brelltender
58 dwarven cleric
who can probably get to 60, then PL a DE cleric up to 60, gank the Ragefire
spawn with a clear concience, long before number 63 on a list comes up.
