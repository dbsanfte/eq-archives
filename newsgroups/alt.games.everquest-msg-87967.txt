    And, of course, to prevent you from cherry-picking certain higher level
NPCs (read: Vulak), they have been replaced with some odd questish-looking
thing. And all the other mobs near those certain higher-level NPCs have been
stealth altered as well, like the new pet-like guards or perma-root on some
of them. Why give you new content when we can force you to re-learn the same
old content?

    Which makes sense, as characters below level eight get no XP from the
old light blue cons.

    Hey, Dan: Sense X spells still broken?

    Woo-hoo! A REAL reason to get smithing up there - if the AC is now the
same as Enchanted Dwarven Plate, that is.

    The first three had already been released as recipes, so they'd better
work now. And good to see the Spirits are being fixed after a year or so.

    There's a whole mess of spawns in Kunark. It looks like now Iksar monks
will be able to get either the Whistling Fists, or now have an alternate
route to the RotLC. Looks like my doing half the Shackle of Steel last night
WAS a bit lucky! (Shackles are now human-wearable, evidence that this may be
an alternate path to the Robe.)

    Whoops, not yet fixed.

    They increased the HPs given on a spell nobody's yet seen.

    Early reports are that all the low-level mobs are out, replaced by level
55ish mobs.

    Didn't BSTs already have Resistant and Fearless at a lower level than
this?

    There's also now changed daggers in game that have +Backstab on them.
VERY innovative - ups damage output without changing ratios.

    Perhaps he's trying to tell you to go to the halls below the SHM guild
and kill that imposter Master Glox that's there now!
