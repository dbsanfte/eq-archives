After about 4 years I'm burnt out with the whole game.  Seems I start doing
one thing then Verant changes the game and makes it seem useless to continue
that quest so I start another, another, another, I have many characters on
different servers and selling my account simply seems to be a permanent way
out for me.  If I keep the account I keep going back and wasting another
evening coming away feeling exasperated.  Everybody is so greedy, well not
everybody but most everybody.  I see people selling things in the bazaar for
insane prices.  Some things I give away to people that need them I'm seeing
sold for thousands.  I understand though because you want something someone
else is asking a ridiculous price.  It's too much like the real world people
cutting your throat for personal gain.  I guess that makes me a casual
player, playing for fun.  The fun is gone.

Does anybody buy accounts anymore?  Yeah I know it's a bad question to ask
but I'd like to get some of my money back to spend on my next addiction.
I've put this off a year thinking I'd start enjoying the game again but the
final straw was a enchanter spell nerf.  Nobody really cares about anyway.
I just got tired of Verant having the power to take something away after
having it about 10 levels on my nearly 60 Enchanter.  It's either destroy my
account and watch all my characters disappear or sell them to someone who
wants and might enjoy them.
