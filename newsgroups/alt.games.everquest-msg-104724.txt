Now you're being rediculous. Because I choose to group as the game
was designed and want to see, and play in, all the game content I am
paying for being unreasonable? Unbelievable.

Actually I play several other classes, Monk mostly.

Yep my druid is just a port whore now.

Oh Jeez what an idiot I am! I thought all classes would have equal viability
in the high end game. Want to show me where it says that a druid is
only a solo class and shouldn't be used in the high end game anywhere in
the manual or the eq website, because I must have missed it.
