The term "Resident Uber Guild" to me means a bunch of people with no life
and the
reason why they a in a "group formation" is to make everyone else in the
group feel that it is ok to not have a life.

Rezbot? It is gamers like this that suck the life out of good games and
break
it down into the dark world of linear gameplay. After they are done sucking
up every last fun aspect of a game they run to next game and repeat the
process.
Much like a bloodthirsty tick on the family dog.

I laugh at the fact that you know the exact time it took to do such a thing.
But which is worse? The person who did it or the other person that has
wasted valuable memory space on such a useless statistic.

Plenty said. Now I just hope all you people flee to SWG and drain it
of its life so the rest of us can rebuild.

I weep for Everquest 2.
