If that was ever the case, it has most definitely changed.

What does happen is that main inventory slots are filled first, so if you
put a container in the trade window after other items, the other items may
fill your main inventory slots leaving no room for container(s).  They did
update it so that you will end up with one item in your hands, but any
additional items will still fall on the ground.  If there is room in
containers, then items in the trade window will go into the containers, if
they can fit in the containers.  Again, they will go into the containers in
the order they are in the trade window, so if you have a larger item farther
down in the trade window, smaller items may fill up your large item spots to
the point of having now available slot where the larger item(s) will fit.
