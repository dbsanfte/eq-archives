Quick warning on this, the Iksar Bandit Lord hits like a girl (level 35 hits
like level 15) but Grachnist makes up for it, (level 35 hits like level 40),
he nearly wiped his butt with a level 38 monk in my guild, if I hadn't been
there to DS and heal him, then again, the goblin that was healing Grach
wasn't helping the situation any.
