It seems to me the /con is more to display harmony with nature, which
doesn't exclude being a part of the natural cycle. Amiable doesn't
necessarily mean they consider you a friend, either. Just means
they're nice to you. ;p

Not all animals they killed were "non-trivial" to kill. ;p The
philosophy depends on the tribe, too. Doesn't seem any more wrong to
apply my theory than yours, and many of them themselves have spoken of
respect for nature. Either way, though, that doesn't change the
philosophy I apply to my roleplay, I just used what most people
envision the Native American philosophy of old being in respect to
hunting as a reference.
