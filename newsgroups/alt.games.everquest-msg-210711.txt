Also, calling them epic weapons is a mis-nomer.  They are class
particle effect weapons obtained by an epic quest.  The distinction
is important:  Calling them "epic weapons" suggests they are the
best available, ever.  This wasn't the intent.  I wish all the whiny
mages at the Tower would get over the fact that they now have to 
actually choose the best pet for the circumstances, (from 2, but 
they are working on the fire pet) rather than simply hauling out the
epic for all occasions.
