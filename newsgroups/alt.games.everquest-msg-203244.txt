Enchanters are old hands at this.  Back when Greater Faymart and FreeBuff
were the places to be for banking or tradeskills, you had to learn to get in
and out of town without being swamped with beggars.  Grab a Walrus Tooth,
/cast Illusion:Dwarf, and poof - one dwarven warrior coming up!  (Walrus
tooth looks like a sword equipped).  Any old staff and Illusion:Iksar makes
you just another monky-boy wandering around if you remember to take off your
robe, and makes you a necro if you don't (Staff of the Arisen Cultist is
great for the necro version!).  Also for the imitation Necro, try
Illusion:Skeleton.  Illusion:Spirit Wolf should have been called
Illusion:Druid, many people don't notice that you're transparent - but why
imitate a buffing class?
