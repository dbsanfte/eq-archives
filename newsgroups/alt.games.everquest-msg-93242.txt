Huh? What message? There's a message here? better go check the rest of
the post to see what you're refering to. Scrolling, brb...

OK, found the post below. Please continue.

There was something written?

Hang on a sec, scrolling down to see what you're referring to. Brb...

OK, back now. Now I know what you're referring to.

Going to check the rest of the message to see if it's worth it. Brb...
....
Ok, checked it. On balance, I think, 'YES', it's worth reading.

Since I've only scanned the rest of the message the other 3 times,
trying to find out what you were referring to, I guess I can read it
completely now (for the 4th time), then scroll up to re-read the parts
you are referring to.

(un-snipped for obvious reasons)

OK, so I was exagerating, but the reason top-posting is a no-no is
because it's more difficult to read. If you're referring to a comment,
answering a question, disagreeing with a view, unless you state what it
is you're referring to, people won't know.

This has lead to it being a long established part of usenet etiquette.
