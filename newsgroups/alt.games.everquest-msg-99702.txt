And you're still being an idiot. The standard assumption for a typical
EQ player is that the person they are talking to isn't a gibbering
twit. Unfortunately, in your case, that assumption was wrong.

I still can't believe you blame the druid for porting you to the best
they could do for you. I hope you never get ported again. It would be
poetic justice if you bitched the druid out at the time and they
spread your ignorance around.
