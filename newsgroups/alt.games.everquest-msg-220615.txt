Taunt does not add hate.  A successful Taunt only moves the person to the
top of the mobs hate list.  The only reason the mob would run after the ENCH
after mezz was broken and the Taunt was successful is if the ENCH had cast a
DOT or a Debuff/Slow on the mob or they decided to sit down.  Sitting has a
huge agro range.

Disarm is not a reliable means to use ever.  Disarm was a poorly thought out
ability that needs major over haul but at this late date I would guess it
will never be addressed in EQ.

The Warrior's problems really do not start showing up frequently until they
hit their 50s and need EXP groups.  A friend of mine told me once that as a
Warrior, he did fine until he started taking on mobs that were harder than
what are found in KC in the Dreadlands.  When Luclin was introduced, the
mobs started hitting much faster and their attack rating started getting
insanely high.  If a mob has a huge attack number then no amount of AC will
help prevent them from hitting you.  And a Warrior in all likelihood, unless
he or she has a Hate Procing weapon, will not be able to Main Tank POP mobs.
Against a POP mob, with a Warrior MT, Shamans have to wait until the mob is
under 90% health before attempting a slow.  Otherwise they will take agro
from the Warrior and  mana will be wasted on healing.  This is not very good
for an EXP group.

Originally this is how things should have worked in my opinion.  A group of
6 would have 1 Warrior who would MT.  A backup Plate class of either a
Shadow Knight or Pally could be added to the group and a third Melee of
either a Monk or Rogue  could be added for more DPS.  Then there would be a
Slower/Haster, a Mezzer of some sort and finally a pure Healer (Cleric).  A
nuker could be substituted for the Monk/Rogue or Mezzer.  The Shadow Knight
or Pally could watch out for any time that the Warrior lost Agro either due
to a Nuke or Heal and could instantly cast on the mob to get it off the
finger wigglers.  Then Warrior Taunts mob off of SK/PAL and continue.  A
scenario like this totally falls apart when you begin to fight post-Velious
mobs.  Like I said earlier, their Attack ratings are so high and they hit so
damn fast and hard that a Warrior could see his health drop 50% before the
mob is at 90%.  With a Shadow Knight or Pally as MT, a Shaman can slow the
mob while it is being pulled without fear of the Mob agroing them.

Of course there are tons of combinations to make up groups.  You can have
groups where a MT is not even needed.  I have been in a group where it was
me(monk), 2 other monks, Shaman, Bard and Cleric and it was a non-stop
pull-fest.
