Then you LOSE your case.

You should have read more carefully. I'll c&p it for you.

"If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you
summarize the original at the top of the message, or include just
enough text of the original to give a context. This will make sure
readers understand when they start to read your response. Since
NetNews, especially, is proliferated by distributing the postings from
one host to another, it is possible to see a response to a message
before seeing the original. Giving context helps everyone. But do not
include the entire original! "

They're talking about summarizing the text you're quoting, if you
don't directly quote, you moron. LOL. See the words "when they start
to read your response"? They not only break your argument, they
*assume* you are bottom posting!

I also note you ignored the very advice it gives, as well - to not
quote the entire text, just what you are replying to.

And you say you've been online how long?
