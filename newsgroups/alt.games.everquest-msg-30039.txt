Camping / farming is bad no matter what as it implies anti-social behavior 
(it's mine; go away!!!).  I did not mean to infer otherwise.  But, if no 
one is around a single spawn area, like one of the spires in SK, to me it 
is OK to camp until people start wanting the spawn.  I have always offered 
to share a particular site if someone wanted it.  But I also realize there 
are many other areas to hunt, so I'm just as likely to move on, too.  I do 
agree that groups camping may not be as social.  The primary ones I am 
aware of being in SK:  the spires, treant spawn, and hermit.

The example that was getting this guy's goat was Guk.  High level farming, 
keeping the experience-possible groups out, was his gripe.  But you're 
right, what IS the difference between a level 40 camping a spot that gives 
experience and a group of mid 30's in the same spot when others want to 
share? None whatsoever.
