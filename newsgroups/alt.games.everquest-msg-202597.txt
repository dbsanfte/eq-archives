Then you must not have bothered to skillup your bard's track at all.

At max for both, a Bard's track range is exactly 1/2 that of a ranger (100
vs. 200). That is, I believe, on the order of 1500 - I'd like to see your
ranger that has a range of 1500. Druids stop at a skill of 125 (distance of
something like 1850).

Ranger track beats Bard and Druid track hands down, but I would still say on
a scale of 0-10 where zero is not having Track, Bard track is a 7, druid
track an 8, and ranger track is, of course, a 10.

Yep. Pretty much. :) Although, you could argue that it's a little like
everything in the game too..... LOL

Haven't seen any formal polls on this (would love to), but, yeah, most folks
I know that have messed with many classes call a Bard the hardest very
closely followed by a chanter. Then there's everything else.
