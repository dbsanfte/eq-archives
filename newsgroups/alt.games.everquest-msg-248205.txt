Somethings I left out:

We will have an Enchanter for CC
We will ( or at least are planning to ) face CT alone, after clearing
the zone entirely
There will be 2 pet classes who will send in pets to gain the DT, with
a little luck we can take him out under the 10 minute recycle
AE spells in this case would be a waste for my part
tank will likely hold aggro for most of the battle, but DI and DB are
good suggestions

Thanks.
