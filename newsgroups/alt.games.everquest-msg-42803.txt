    Should be. The bug collection fellow is one person I see being killed a
lot out there.

    High Hold is a pain to hunt in. Massive range of /cons, many wanderers.
The area with the smugglers always seemed interesting, but one of them is
VERY high level and will kill you in seconds. If you hold off, at higher
level you can go kill things inside the Keep like the two bards on the
second floor, or the nobles.

    Start killing barbarians around the world, then. Plenty of outdoors
barbarians, from WK to Lake Rathetear. And speaking of WK, don't forget the
obligatory turn at the Millers' farm!

    Don't forget the other aqua elves you can go after - the elves on the
island in Timorous Deep. Rarely camped except for blood by tradeskillers.

    There's at least one Mechanic that's very killable, just below the
cleric's guild. Also there's two guards out in Steamfront that are killed on
a regular basis - NOT the one within sight of Ak'Anon, he's buffed up. At
higher levels, the gnome in Lesser Faydark right near the Steamfront zone is
another popular target.

    Hmm, what other targets always annoyed my characters when I saw them
killed.... bards, of course - there's several around the world, and most
will not be aided by local guards when attacked. Most bard spawn times have
been nerfed, but if you see them, might as well, right? ;-) I know the bard
outside High Keep was an easy blue at 31. Hmm..... you could pull Pilgrims
and Drixies in FV if you found a safe spot. There's slaves all around the
world, like the prisoners in Cazic Thule, or the prisoners in Crushbone. If
you hunt the Sisters, your CB Orc faction will be high enough that you could
med by Crush's feet. I've never heard of anyone killing on the other island
in OoT, with the fishing tackle merchant - that might be fun. Oh, Ortallius
in SRo, he's quite killable as long as you don't care about Temple of Sol Ro
faction.

    And panda bears. It's inherently evil to kill panda bears.
