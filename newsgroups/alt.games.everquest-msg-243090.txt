Yes and its VERY annoying. As Back suggested, if you manually move
with the boat when it takes off, youll "Catch" the boat as Back
described and youll be all set - until you zone - when you have to
catch it again.

Whats even more annoying since the patch is getting stuck in geometry.
In Cazic Thule, me and my wife often get stuck on the ladders. Heck,
she even got stuck in a tree in POK - couldnt move, couldnt sit to mem
gate - nothing. /petition??? hahahah - tried that in CT - they finally
got back to me 8 hours later - after I had died and summoned my body.
Oh and they mentioned a /rewind command in the first patch since the
new engine. Well it must have been omitted, for when you try it - you
get the very reasurring message that its an invalid command =/.

/sigh One of the nice things about a "mature" on line game is the
absence of game stopping bugs. Well back to the drawing board.

I used to flame people whod complain and call SOE programmers stupid
(being a programmer myself - I guess I have some empathy for them) but
damn, this latest wave of annoying bugs has me wondering myself
finally.
