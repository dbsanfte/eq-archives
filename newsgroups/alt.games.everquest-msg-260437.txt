This is true if they are the first people to ever go there.
One of the things mentioned was finding your way back to some place
(questgiver etc) and the sextant/compass/maps would help with that.

What really bugs me is in most games having no way to annotate the map
once I have been somewhere and know what's there.

There is some of that yes, but if someone sends me on a quest to deliver
the golden foozle to their buddy, i'd expect them to give some kind of
aid in the form of directions, maps etc.
Could even be an enchanted compass that points to a specific destination
instead of north (hey with magic it would be possible.)

The website thing in particular is going to happen no matter what, but
then, there's nothing forcing you to look at the websites.

I guess what pisses me off is it's one of two ways.  Either there's no
ingame stuff for help, or there's "lead me by the nose" help, neither of
which really fits.
