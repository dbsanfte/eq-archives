Your skill goes up (gets checked for skill increase
actually) when you click the Track button.  So you can leave
it tracking the same mob but you have to continually hit the
track button as it ungreys to get a skill increase.  Yes you
can sit and track something.  I do this with my druid some
times, giving some basic directions to the tank that is
pulling when I need to med.  You don't have to switch
targets for skill increases you just have to click on the
track button, you can then hit either escape, or I (or
whatever you have your inventory mapped to) to close the
window.  But actually you don't even have to select a target
for tracking just hitting the track button is enough.
