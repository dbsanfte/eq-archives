Maybe the spawn time wasn't as long as people always had though, but rather that 
fewer people are killing him? When I did the quest a month ago or something he 
wasn't up when I first went there. Later that night after work I came back and 
hung out a while and he spawned after a little bit. I was told by people that I 
may have to fight off others for the camp spot, but I didn't see a single person 
the entire time.
