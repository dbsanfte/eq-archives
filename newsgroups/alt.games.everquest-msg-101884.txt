>>>The leader constantly called everybody "hun" and talked almost completely
in abbreviations and "shortened" words. <<<

I mentioned this in another thread, but I'll say it hear too.

Before playing EQ, I spent a lot of time in chat rooms. A lot of the people
who frequent chat rooms speak in the same way you are describing your former
guild leader. My wife, who spends about 90% of her online time in chat
rooms, writes to me this way in her Emails (although she doesn't call me
hun, but that's a separate issue).

So basically, people are bringing their "chat speak" into EQ, where other
people see it, think it's cool, and are copying it.
