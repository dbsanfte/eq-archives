No, no, I don't have anything against your point here, I merely brought it
up to indicate that you had a totally different angle, and that neither of
you even claimed to have tested it out.

One mana per tic is darn close to how incredibly slow bard mana regens.
Really really really slowly.  Meditation skill is capped at one, after all.

My 65 cleric can notice a difference in meditation with just a couple points
of FT items, and his med skill is something well over 200 (I forget where
the cap is, been a long time since I hit it.

Surely a 56 bard with his massively lower med skill would see a much more
marked difference, almost as dramatic as the one you suggest.  So the
question is, -if- FT works, why don't I hear more about it?  Or contrawise,
if it -doesn't- work, surely someone would have noticed that and mentioned
it.  But there we have it, nothing but rumor and logical thought processes
like this to go by.
