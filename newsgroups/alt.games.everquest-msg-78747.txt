Kunzar something-or-other, I'm sure JaZZ will talk your ears off about it as
soon as he can reply.

As I recall, our trio or sometimes, quad, group went to OOT to hunt Seafury
Cyclops.  Fairly good exp and loot, but we did have a few deaths from
accidental aggron on the Tainted Seafury.  One time, Jakugg aggrod the
Tainted, told us to camp (cleric and I) and swam kited the Tainted over to
the AC island.  There, Jakugg died and after I camped back on and dragged
his corpse to the cleric, the Tainted stayed "locked" on AC island.   Hard
way to get him out of our area, but effective.  Jakugg and Tiru also used
the time in OOC to camp the AC and get their Jboots.
We also did EJ around the same time and finished up 48-49 in TD at the
spiroc's.

Emerald Jungle is a great place for QUICK hunting if you have a druid or
wizard in your group.  If you have a short time to play and don't want to
find a dungeon and fight for spawns and camps, EJ is the answer.  Just evac
the group to EJ, run to TT zoneline and you have decent, safe killing.  I
still find "blue to me" Mobs there at 54 but from 47 to 52, you can get some
fair exp.   Very seldom camped and if it is, you can share the zoneline's
left and right sides with 2 groups easy. Just focus your pulls to the west
and to the east.
