I think you are letting smileys substitute for thought here. Admittedly, 
my monk is only level 39, so I'm a beginner to the class, but while I'm 
well acquainted now with the effects of the mitigation nerf (I'm used to 
the CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH sound as the mobs hit me for max damage on 
almost every round), Feign Death is such an amazing skill I'm simply 
incapable now of playing any other melee or hybrid class (the only thing 
ever that's better than FD is Gate). In the 20-odd levels since I got 
Feign Death I've died a grand total of *twice*, and I've been in some 
hairy situations.

Mend is, in comparison, less useful, but once your skill gets above 100, 
you find you can't live without it. More often than not it's all the 
difference between winning a fight or abandoning it.
