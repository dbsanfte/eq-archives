you are a retard. i am sorry to say this but come on a cleric can get a
group at any time. a cleric can solo up to 45. if you can't that is your
fault. a cleric makes more money in the game then any other character and if
smart has cha gear to keep his cost down when he is in town. you have no
right to post here or with verant! even though i dislike verant why waste
there time on somthing you call boring.... my best option to tell you is
change classes
