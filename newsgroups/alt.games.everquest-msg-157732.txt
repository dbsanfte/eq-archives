You have a week to explore PoP.  After that, the expansion will be much like any other zone,
already known, already explored, strategies and hunting spots already known.

New is only new when its new.  It won't be new later.  Post patch pops will happen every time
there's a patch... and that will be frequently this next month while they work out the kinks
in PoP.

Your fiance is currently a virgin.  Why don't you go down to the corner bar and have a few
beers while I sleep with her.  After all, you'll be sleeping with her for the rest of your
life... what does it matter to you that she's only going to lose her virginity once, and while
it Could be with you, your buddies want to go to the bar again as usual?
