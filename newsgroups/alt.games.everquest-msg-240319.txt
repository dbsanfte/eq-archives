And if you would snip the irrelevant junk - we wouldn't have to scroll
past anything.

It's an amazing thing, but in those threads that Andrew pointed to
as "proof" that other groups top-posted, the vast majority (well, all
of the ones I saw) of the top-posters also didn't snip.

Basically what I see is 

"I'm too lazy to snip and context post to make a cogent point.  I just
post to see myself type."
