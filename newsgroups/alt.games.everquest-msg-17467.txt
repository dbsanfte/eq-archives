Tell that to the enchanters, magicians, necromancers, druids, and shaman
that are completely useless against the current uber mobs (other than
casting buffs and then logging out until the buffs need to be renewed).

The fact is that the classes have *never* been balanced in EQ.  That's why
Verant is constantly adjusting them.

Best you can do is play something you like, and hope that when you are
in a level range where you are on the weak side of the balance (balance
changes with level), you either get through it fast, or one of Verant's
adjustments helps you.
