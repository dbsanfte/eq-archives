strictly speaking nerfing is any situation where something worked more
to the players advantage before it was 'fixed' upto and including
blatant bug fixes.

Nobody says blatant bugs shouldn't be fixed. If two duelists are
supposed to be fighting with short swords and one of them gets handed
a lightsabre... there is definately a problem that *needs* to be
fixed. But a regular short sword is a definate nerf of the
lightsabre...

(Of course SOE's solution would be to give both opponents nerf bats,
or disable dueling entirely and call it fixed... and that's the REAL
problem.)
