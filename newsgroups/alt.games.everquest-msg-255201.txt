It's an annoying bug that has been around for some time.  I think they 
had it fixed for a while, but, perhaps it's been broken again.  When 
root/rotting in PoN quite some time back, I saw it happening frequently, 
did not seem to have anything to do with range, and the mobs were taking 
DoT damage at the time.
