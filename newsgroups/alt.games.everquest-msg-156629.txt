OK, so that will work to stop ninja looting of class specific items on raids
that are killing a mob specifically to go for that item.  E.g., if a raid is
going for Phinny to get epic drops for a Wizard, Bard, and Mage, option 3
can be used before Phinny is killed to make those three looters.

However, it sounds like there will still be a problem with things like
Velious quest armor drops.  I wonder why they didn't add a 4th option: "All
raid members can loot"?
