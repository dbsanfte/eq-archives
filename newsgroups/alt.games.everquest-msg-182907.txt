	Well it appears that the way to Broken Skull Rock will be
through the lightly used Odus continent.
I quote the Lore info from the home page:

"One particularly astute scout of Tunare sought a safe route to Broken
Skull Rock. In his travels, he happened upon a smuggler transferring
goods to the island, departing from a remote dock in the Stonebrunt
Mountains. This was far from the normal routes the pirate ships
patrolled. After a bit of bargaining the elf procured passage on his
ship. This proved to be a reliable method for reaching Broken Skull
Rock, though the journey was dangerous and there was no guarantee of
safety upon arrival."

There also appers to be some new portal spells to Stonebrunt
Mountains.  nuther quote:

"To aid the cause, the Academy of Arcane Sciences and the Druids of
Surefall devised new magics for swift travel to the Stonebrunt
Mountains. As copies of these spells made their ways into the hands of
some of the shadier merchants in the Commonlands, adventurers of all
sorts began heading to Broken Skull Rock. "

Appears they have a way of trying to get peeps to use the less used
continent.  I did not see, however, any mention of the fast portal
books to the area.


Eagerly awaitng the first post of the Patch message.

Good hunting all.
