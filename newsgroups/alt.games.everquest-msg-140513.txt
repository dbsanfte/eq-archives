You're assuming their ass actually -is- big.  How you would know the 
dimensions of another postr's ass is beyond me, but in either case, big or 
not, people generally do not enjoy having attention called to it.  It is 
insulting, and therefore a personal attack.

}No, cluelessness etc is not an attribute.  A fat ass is!  being black is,

Attribute n., 1. A quality or characteristic inherent in or ascribed to 
someone or something. (Dictionary.com)

Those are -all- attributes, except possibly being Ghandi.  Having a 
particular name is arguably an attribute as well, but that's rather 
tenuous.  You seem to be suffering from some delusion that it has to be 
physically measurable in order to be an attribute.
