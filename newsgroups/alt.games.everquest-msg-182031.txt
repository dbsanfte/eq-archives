    That could have been the reasoning of the officers. It certainly would
delay at least half of them by one week, as they waitied for RZ to respawn.
It could also be to do with pride. The elemental planes, excepting the
actual deity encounters, are "reward" zones in that the loot is better than
anything before them, but the mobs that loot drops from are easier than RZ.
There's prestige in winning past the tough encounter, and the tangible
reward for it is the easy loot in the zones that follow. Vex Thal is the
same way. If you can kill Emperor in Ssra, you can clear Vex Thal. So part
of it might have been to ensure that the guild that got access deserved the
prestige and tangible rewards that go with killing RZ.

    I'd guess it's more the former than the latter, but I'm not an officer.
The important part to me is that the other two guilds agreed to this
restriction.

    Anyone gaining access could do the same, though. And we're not playing
to block others from content, so just racing for every RZ spawn was out of
the question.

    Again, because we're not assholes. The older members remember what it
was like breaking into NToV when the old number one guild tried to block
access, and they don't want to be like that. The civilized thing to do when
multiple parties want to kill something is to try and work out a sharing
agreement, and that's what we did. We did it for Cursed, we did it for
Emperor (even when other guilds hadn't killed Emperor we gave them an equal
number of attempts per spawn as ourselves), and we did it here. I honestly
don't think our officers thought they'd so brazenly break the agreement.
