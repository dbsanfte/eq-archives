The command isn't /drag, it's /corpse.  Typing "/corpse" (or
most people build a hotkey for it) will yank your corpse
to where you are from up to about 50 feet away.  Any
farther away, and it will gripe at you with a "that
corpse is too far away" message.

"Dragging" a corpse is what it's called when you repeatedly
use the /corpse command (usually by machine-gunning the
custom hotkey) while you run from one place to another.
You keep leaving the corpse behind for a second or two,
but yank it to yourself again each time you press the
hotkey anew.  It'll look like it's bouncing along
behind you if you do it right as you run.

You can drag other people's corpses too, but only
if they have specifically /consent'ed you to do so,
and you actually have their corpse targeted in
your target window (without that, the /corpse
command will try to find one of your *own*
corpses to yank).
