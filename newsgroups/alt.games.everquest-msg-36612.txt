Greetings everybody,

Last night my druid saw the biggest train of his life. We just got a full
group going and entered Paw. Both bedrooms were taken so we went to the
large room with the big wooden doors. As you enter the room, on the left
there is a little place where you can pull realtively safe. We were doing
pretty good when one of the pullers from a bedroom group opened the doors
and went inside. I did not pay attention to that. We finished our gnoll and
took a med break until next spawns. Then the doors opened and the puller
came out at full spead followed by a shitload of gnolls. The big room was in
5 seconds full with them running after the poot guy. We all hugged our wall,
some of us got invisible at once, the others hide or just stood there. The
gnolls were still coming from inside and running to zone. I think the guy
pulled the whole damn dungeon. There were a LOT of deep red gnolls to my 31
druid. After a short while they came back and headed inside to their spot.
We stood there while they were passing by and started to count. We got 40
gnolls or so :) After that we went, just out of curiousity, to the bedrooms.
Nedless to say, they were packed with corpses.

I heard the puller shouting 1 hour for a group later, while kiting some
avocets ...

What is the biggest train you saw ?
