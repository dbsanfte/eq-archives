Nah, I don't think you've been difficult at all, the player community for 
this game is *strong* and full of passion, in large part because there's 
such a huge installed base for EQLive and the expectations are high for a 
worthy successor. Everyone's got an opinion on this one, some of them quite 
passionate (like yours).

After all the discussion around the boards lately concerning playerbase 
(WoW, EQLive, etc.), it's really apparent that these games do have different 
audiences with very distinct levels of maturity and discipline. I think EQ2 
is going to benefit tremendously from the installed base they inherit.

Foxeye, did you participate in either the Legends or LOE offers, or are you 
trying to get in under the regular beta test application?
