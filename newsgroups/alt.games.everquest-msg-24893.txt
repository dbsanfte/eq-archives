I see alot of whining on various boards from greedy players who always want
to roll on stuff they cant use. Need Before Greed is a standard in several
dungeons such as KC, OS for example. I saw a very good post from a cleric on
the subject and give it here to help educate some of the younger players who
arent familiar with the concept.

"here is a little wis from your group cleric
here are what stats are required for your class
wis + Mana + ac + saves = cleric shaman druid items
ac + str +saves = warrior items
ac + str + int + saves =sk items
ac + str +wis + saves =paladin items
int + mana + saves = mage wizard necromancer and enchanter items
AC + str + saves + agil + dex = rogue
now for the intelligence impared people
low weight + ac + str +resist = monk items
yes its true its a monk needs low weight stop being a retard and let the
monk get some stuff he will need if you say im dumb then you are just plan
ignorant
if i ever saw an enchanter who had his int and chr both at 200 and were
trying to fill other slots so they could sit in the heat of the battle and
try to tank so there neat weapon could proc i as a cleric would let them
die, why cause if you dont know your roll then you need to learn it and i
will give you your fist lesson
as for melee classes are you dumb you can do so much better in zones much
much easier than this ( for those who dont know the stuff in the back of
skyshrine is serious crap if you consider vox or naggy a hard fight then go
back home cause when them lvl 60 wyverns open up on you you either know your
roll or your all dead)
and for enchanters ac isnt going to save your ass when a mob is opening a
can of wup ass on you your cleric, if your cleric is smart he has atone
memed (nothing says living like a mob who forgot who he was pissed at), 16
60 600 ac isnt going to save you (the int caster) its the intelligence of
your group. should your lvl 50 group have gone to sebilis hell no go back to
karnors if your lvl 50 in sebilis your a joke and everyone there is laughing
at you.
so remember use some common sence and things will be just fine...... forget
your roll and you condem us all
p.s. knowing your roll isnt knowing what you rolled (in your attempt to be
the most ignorant ass in eq) on a random 100"
