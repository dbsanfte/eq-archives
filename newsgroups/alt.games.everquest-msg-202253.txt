I have a 26th Ogre Beastlord and a 34th Troll SK.

Most fun?  You'd have to determine that yourself.  

 The Ogre was very easy to get to 26th.  He can take on multiple
yellows or a single red.  I had no real trouble getting him into
groups as most groups view Beastlord as 2 tanks.  Also at higher
levels, you get a mana regen spell that stacks with everything so
beastlords are desired.

  The troll SK, I mainly started to experience the swamp and Guk (I
started him before trolls were kicked out).  He could solo in Guk but
needed lots of downtime to recover health (I couldn't group in Guk as
I was the only low level person there).  After about level 12 or so I
headed to PC where he went to 26th.  I had no real trouble getting
groups with him either.

However, he was very difficult to solo in PC and going from 12th to
20th was hard.  At 20th, his damage cap came off and he was a little
easier to play.
I also picked up a mithril 2h sword cheap at this time and 20th -26th
was much easier (not as easy as the beastlord however).

At 30th, when he got the 45 point lifedrain, he became much easier to
solo.  I haven't had any trouble getting groups as groups often need
tanks and SK fits that bill.

The SK tanks much better IMHO.  He takes less damage from equal mobs
and hits them for more.  But the beastlord with pet does more damage
to the mob and kills it quicker.  The beastlord can take on yellows
and reds where I stuck to even or blues with the SK.

The beastlord is monklike fighter with shaman lite spells.  The SK is
fighter with necro lite spells.
