It's been 5 years since someone walked into a dowtown DMV and 
got an ID saying he was me, and I had an old debt he incurred
go into collection and catch up with me about .5 years ago - 
Police reports, affadavits, you name it, it's been one hell
of a road.  He did well over 10k in damage, and
did most of it within 2 weeks of getting the ID - it just takes
this long for people to catch up to me, and find out they have
the wrong guy.
