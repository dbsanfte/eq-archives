What I want to be able to do, since my current account has all the
characters I wish to use, is have that account be able to play
simultaneously on both machines. I will pay whatever I have to for
licenses, but I don't want to have to start a new account, and if I
did, there's no way I'd pay $50 to have a character transferred. Or
does Sony not allow the same account, not character but account, to be
logged in more than once simultaneously?
