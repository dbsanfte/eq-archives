WIsh I could tell you how many times I asked this
before I finally got res.  Rarely did I get an answer
at all, most people seemed not to know or thought
I was joking or something.  One person said yes,
another no, so it wasn't till I finally hit 39 that I
tested it out.

Yes you can.  Get exp back and everything.  From
that point on, not only are you everone's best friend...
but you -never- have to worry like they do that
you won't get a res.  Bind near where you fight,
stick a chipped rod and some invis potions in the bank
for really tricky to get to bodies, and relax just a little
about dying.

Hit 49 and relax a lot more... although from 45 up you
may have found yourself actively seeking a "better res"
a few times.  At 49, though, you are looking at a mere
10% of the usual loss.

There are bodies that are hard to get to.  Make friends
with rogues (excellent CR guys) and Necros (for the
impossible CRs) as well as wizzards and druids (to
get you -to- the body via port and invis and SOW) to
make sure you get to yourself within the three hour limit

Remember when you res yourself you will be OOM
as well as crippled and low on health.  Res/Buff/Heal
anyone nearby till you are down to -barely- enough
mana to do the res, why waste mana?
