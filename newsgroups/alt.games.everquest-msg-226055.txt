I'm pretty sure that is does work that any int caster line can research any
priest line.  The "specific int class" for "specific priest class" is was a
rumor based on walkthroughs of doing the enhanced research was introduced.
At any rate, a friend's enchanter has researched spells for both his druid
and a friend's shaman.

I tend to believe that it's hard to make money on the new research abilities
for the typical player.  The components required to research the "in demand"
spells either require killing a pretty nasty mob to get the drop or cost an
arm and a leg in the bazaar.  The other side of the coin is that even
successfully researching and selling one very rare spell could set you up
with a huge profit.  It seems like it's a "it takes money to make money"
situation.  My friend with the enchanter made a good penny not by
researching the spells, but by farming Veksar for high-level word drops.
YMMV, but when it was introduced I didn't run to the trainer and bump up my
research skills.  I'm curious to know if anyone on the board has made a
hefty profit on the new research.
