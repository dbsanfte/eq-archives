According to Lucy, Swarming death has had its damage reduced by less
than 10% per tick (to 224), but duration increased by 50% (six ticks
to nine) and mana cost increased by 7.  Winged death lost ~15% damage
per tick but also became ~35% cheaper to cast.  I can't check in game
because I don't have internet access at the moment, and don't have a
druid anyway, is Lucy no longer reliable?
