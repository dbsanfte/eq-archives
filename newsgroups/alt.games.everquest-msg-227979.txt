From the shadows, the mysterious "Richard Lawson" <nouma@msn.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>I'm not totally sure this guy "gets" it.  What he wants is a world where you
>can have PvP.  What has been shown time and time again is that PvP is not a
>sustainable and viable game in today's market.

Or that it hasn't been done right.

It's worth mentioning that UO had very good subscriber numbers
*before* trammell.

Shadowbane had a very large number of loud and hopeful fans.

The problem in both cases is it wasn't implemented correctly.

However I see PvP as an aside. He is right about the world vs game
aspects, and thats what I said I was referring to. He goes on about
PvP in certain parts of his rant, but its not the sole focus of it.

They should get the hell out of mmorpgs then, if they "just want to do
their own thing". And is he the minority, or is his viewpoint simply
unable to be represented due to the options they have available to
them? UO was gimped and then got old. DAoC didn't bother to make PvP
have a point. SB is a disgrace of a game.

PK is NOT the only part of his point. It is in fact a minor part of
the whole.

He exaggerates about Everquest's evilness but the fact is the game
"the majority" enjoy is not the game the "majority" of old enjoyed,
nor is the "majority" of that old "majority" even still impressed with
EQ.

In other words, the generalized playerbase has changed too. Those in
the game now are the ones the NEW EQ has pandered to - the ones the
author refers to as the instant gratification crowd, for good reason.
And as he said they are the ones so far that have made the mmorpg
market the mess it is in now.
