Basic rule for enchanters: avoid grouping with wizards, especially gnome
wizards.

Most wizards will use area attacks that de-mez mobs and won't correct their
tactics.

Shorties are usually (90% of the time in my experience) are run by stupid kids
who whine "don't tell me how to run my character" when you complain that they
are causing the mesmerized monsters to attack.

(Yes, my enchanter has had a lot of bad experiences and will no longer group
with a wizard unless they are from one of two guilds that I work with.)

Him.
