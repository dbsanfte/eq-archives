Hehe, I find weddings weird, sometimes funny  and a bit sad. I couldn't
possibly do it, i think I would be too embarassed, thats not to mention the
incredible piss taking I would get from my RL partner if I ever did. (and
maybe jealousy hehe). I would be very interested to know the ratio of kids
and young adults that do this, surely its gotta be real high!

But, at the end of the day, it's their  business and let em get on with it.
however I  DETEST those ppl that sit around in front of each other smooching
and using lots of /em loves <nobby no life> , or /em kisses <sad but true>
on the lips delicately  etc etc

I will throw in /em is about to be violently sick all over you

Oh, and I agree, they shouldn't be bothered with trains at the dock in
Oasis.

but then maybe they deserve it for choosing the shittest place ever to have
a wedding >)

cheers
