This from someone who claimed to have plonked me.

See if you can follow the bouncing logic: The reason trolls get their 20%
xp penalty is because of their physical stats (which are meaningless), and
their regen (which is not). Iksars, with the EXACT SAME XP PENALTY have the
EXACT SAME REGEN as trolls, but they also have forage, the nice swimming
bonus, their ac bonus (which is huge), and the best starting city in the
game, by a huge margin.

NIGHT VISION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. Night vision is not a bonus
recieved by some races, it is the NORM, the 3 races who do not possess it
are PENALIZED...they are not the baseline, they are worse than the
baseline.

There is exactly no justification whatsoever to lower the iksar xp penalty
because the nightblind races are no longer QUITE as nightblind. You are
just immensely selfish.
