When you visit the different vendors, remember to wear ALL your best
Charisma gear.  And go from vendor to vendor, seeing who will give you the
best deal.  But keep an eye out for Rogues who might want to try to improve
their pickpocketing skills by lifting your charisma gear.  In that
particular zone, PvP pickpocketing is coded to actually work, so beware.

Ask the vendors what faction they're on.

See if you can buy corndogs and popcorn in stacks of 20.

Right click on those stacks to confim that they are only 'Snacks.'  Time how
fast you consume them compared to other food types.

Always refer to pennies as 'coppers,' dimes as 'silver pieces,' and dollars
as gold.  Tens are plat.  That way you can tell us how many plat you blew on
this quest.

Goofy and Pluto are NOT Gnolls.

When you hear the "It's a Small World After All..." music, close your eyes
and think of Rivervale....

Read the security guards' name tags, and say, "Hail, Guard Soandso."  See
what information about the zone they might give you.

Safe Journeys!
