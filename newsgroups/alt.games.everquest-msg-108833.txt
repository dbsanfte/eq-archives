Nah, Gix is a gimp.  Anytime I feel the need for some dark elf parts I pay
him a visit.  The issue there is to choose mobs that suit your abilities.
I've been able to solo Gix for quite a few levels now, even got xp for him
at one time.  There are plenty of mobs out there that I will not attempt to
solo, because I have learned that it is very tough for me to stick spells on
them, including Malosi.  Lately I've been playing in Maiden's Eye, and I
will not even consider soloing a Coterie Legionaire, even when it's blue,
because I know that they resist my spells way too much.  Maybe in a few
levels that resist rate will be low enough, but in the meantime, I stick to
other mobs that are less resistant.

Actually, you are probably right on Gix, he is a tough bastard for the level
he is.  The risk vs reward there is definately quite bad.

I don't agree that you should always be able to tell if you can take down a
mob just by conning him, I think it makes the game far more interesting to
have to learn which mobs are worth going after by trying to do so.  It would
get pretty boring if all you ever had to do was con a mob, or cast some
spell on it, and decide, correctly, that you can take him down based on
that.
