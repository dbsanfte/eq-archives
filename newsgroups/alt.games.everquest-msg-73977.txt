When you are at server select, you have two sorting choices,
aphabetical or by population.  Simply select the latter, then
go with one of the least crowded, other than the Zek's, which
are the PvP servers.

Which servers are least crowded in general is not nearly as interesting
as "least crowded when you are logged on..." you'd get the former,
perhaps, from people answering your question, while you'll get the
latter by logging on when you normally do and sorting as I suggest.
