Got grouped with a pally last nite and they said "your a cleric you
can melee better than a pally" surely he is wrong as I thought clerics
were for dishing out spells.

Reason I ask is I am not sure about this character and was thinking of
dumping it and going for a pally or druid - but now unsure and
thinking of sticking with cleric?
