That sounds right. The most realistic numbers I've seen is high teens
DPS unhasted or dual wielding, pushing close to 40DPS with two weapons
and full buffs including Ferine Avatar.

It doesn't hit much harder, less than 10 points more than the 55 pet.
I would have expected it to hit a lot more often than the 55 pet
though, there's a huge level difference between the two. I never did
parse the 55 pet though, so I'm just guessing.

Wish I could find my level list, I wasn convinced it was under 40th
lvl but can't verify that now <shrug>.
