Anthropomorphic reptiles vs. anthropomorphic mammals. One has milk
glands, the other does not.

By the way, the reason some people have third nipples is that even on
humans, the nipples can lie on a line on each side of the torso,
reaching from the armpits and nearly to the groin. A 'felinomorphic'
human could well end up looking like the triple breasted dancer in
Jabba's palace (heck, with all the lightsaber warrior epic
discussion... :) ) from developing more glands along those two lines
as dictated by feline genetics, while a anthropomorphic feline would
develop oversized glands at only two points on the upper torso as
dictated by human genetics. It's a much smaller change than creating
mammary glands on something that never had them in the first place,
like a reptile. 
Enough biology? :)
