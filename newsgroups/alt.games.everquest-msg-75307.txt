with EQ, a stronger system would help more than a stronger video card

AMD 1800, GeForce III Ti500, 512mb of ram.

No problems bar the "someone zoned in" pause and *occasionally* if I
come up on a bunch of people clustered together a slight pause as it
seems to pull in the textures for them; weird thing is it only happens
once, so the ram is obviously there to keep them in memory. Not sure
why it doesnt just do it at load time.

Maybe more ram would help, but my current feeling is EQ is running
as good as its going to till they fix the code.
