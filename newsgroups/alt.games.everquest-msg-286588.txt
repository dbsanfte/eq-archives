It's definitely not a waste of time.  You yourself posted several
corrected links to "class" web sites, and I folded those into the
July update (and even gave you name credit in the "what's new"
section that month!).  As I said then, the links to "server community"
forums are known to be out of date, and I added a note in that part
of the FAQ saying the links have not been verified recently.  If you
have up-to-date links for any or all of those, or know of other
broken links in the FAQ, by all means let me know either here or
by email.
