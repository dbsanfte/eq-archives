I'm going to make a big vote for NO, and I hope I can see through the
cough medicine and make this as coherent as possible:

1)   There is a fair amount of cross-over traffic here, between the
players who play both.  There would likely be a fair amount of
crossposted messages as well.  Why seperate the threads?

2)  A lot of the posters and regulars who have extensive playtime in
EQ1 may have moved on to EQ2.  By keeping the topics in one group,
those who do have that knowledge can answer the questions that will
still arise about EQ1.  With the seperation of the groups this
information would be more likely to be lost.  This is the main point.

3) Filtering:  tagging the posts appropriately to allow those who are
browsing for a specific topic to search for the info they want.  This
works currently in high-volume groups like comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg,
rec.games.miniatures.warhammer, and rec.sport.pro-wrestling.  It
concentrates the knowledge base for divergent but related topics in
one area.

4) Signal-to-noise:  Right now a.g.e has a really impressive
signal-to-noise ratio, with a fair amount of on-topic discussion.
Splitting the groups would split the user-base and leave both, or more
likely the original, open to threadjacking and blatant off-topic
bullshit.  Letting it turn into another usenet cesspool would be a
waste of the community that has developed here.

...

I'm sure there's more, but I hope that's enough.  I really feel that
another group is not warranted.  I see no reason for it, and feel that
splitting the groups would be a mistake.
