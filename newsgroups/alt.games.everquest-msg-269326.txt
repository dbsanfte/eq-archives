I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do, because it sure
sounds simple enough.  Mine Keyboard Options are set to have "NPAD 8"
as "Move Forward", with alternate "UP".  Similarly for back/right/left.
I never actually use the numpad ones, but that's how it's set up and
the arrow keys work fine for me.

Note that you might need to turn Auto-stand back on to get "standing
from sitting"; I forget whether it's on by default.  That's in the
General Options tab.
