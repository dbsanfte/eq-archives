I have a 55 cleric on the rathe pal and at lev 25 I had a Tank offer plat
for  symbol and have 2  given  stones. In the Planes I have notice the
casters in the group are asking for symbol. I always cast one on chanter,
but shammys are my new fav and I find myself making sure they are taken care
of first.
