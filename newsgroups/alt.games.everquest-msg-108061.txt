I was going through my computer junk drawer when I found the map that came
with my Kunark set. Looking at it, I noticed several areas that could be
zones ....

In Antonica:

in between South Ro and Innothule Swamp is the Rujarkian Hills ...
south of The Feerott is The Dead Hills ...
north of Qeynos is Jaggedpine Forest (I believe this became Sure Fall Glade)
...
north of that (and south of Everfrost Peaks) is The Unkempt Woods ...
NW of Everfrost is The Northlands (Halas is shown as NE of Everfrost) ...
on the opposite side of Halas from Everfrost is The Frigid Plain ...
north of Kith Forst is Lake Neriuss ...


In Faydwer:

in between Butcherblock and Greater Faydark is The Hills Of Shade ...
east of Dagnor's Cauldron and south of Lesser Faydark is The Loping Plains
...
in between The Loping Palins and Steamfont Mountains is Wayunder Lake ...
Greater Faydark and Steamfont Mountains are seperated by Elizerain Lake ...
on the other side of Ak'Anon is The Dragonscale Hills ...


In Odus:

north of Erudin is The Grand Plateau ...
on the other side of Stonebrunt is The Vasty Deep (a lake) ...
also on the other side of Stonebrunt is The Barren Coast ...
note: this is no island shown in Erud's Crossing ...


In Kunark:

there are a set of islands in Timorous Deep called The Broken Teeth ...
east of Field of Bone is The Lake Of Dismay ...
there is a lake north of Emerald Jungle and east of Trakanon's Teeth called
Dragon Drool ...

beta names?
possible zones left out because they weren't finished?

I was just wondering .....
