Hi all,

This may have been asked a dozen times before, and will be asked a dozen 
times after, but I'd like to know and hear several of your opinions on 
the world of Norrath nowadays.

I used to be an EQ player about three to four years ago, not long after 
the game initially launched in America, and long before Verant even 
thought about launching a server in Europe.

I played quite a lot for over a year, and had several characters, ranging 
from wizards to Paladins, and pure Troll fighters. The highest character 
I obtained howerver, was a pretty looking Female Woodelf Druid, which I 
capped at level 24, before I had some horrible server accidents and got 
set back to level 21 before I quit my, then growing and growing, 
addiction.

Nowadays I feel a small urge in me to go play Everquest again, and I've 
seen the EQ DVD with all the expansions on it for about 37 Euros and I'm 
seriously considering getting back into EQ.

The things I'd like to know are:

How is Role Playing ??
Is it worse wth kewl dudes and so on?? Or have things relaxed ??

How is the playing time ??
Will I be able to play for 15 minutes and be able to "do" something 
constructive with my character, other then getting killed and spendeing 
the rest of my time recovering my body ??
Or do I need to team up with time eating guilds to obtain higer end gear 
for my character(s)

How is camping and looting and all that ??


One of the major reasons I quit was, that, in my opninion, I found 
camping and looting got in the way of playing. Everywhere across Norrath 
where people camping rare drops and hogging those items for themselvers 
and driving up prices and so forth.....

What I also *really* didn't like was the amount of time it took me to get 
from level 20 to 24 and losing 4!! levels in one night of freak unstable 
servers on Verant's part or my ISP's part whatever, but loosing weeks of 
playing and frustration to get bit by bit to level 24 to lose 4! levels 
in about one hour :-(

Is the penalty for death still as bad ??

Thanks for your input, for it will really help me decide wheter I will or 
won;t go back to Norrath.

Yours,

Khalistro
