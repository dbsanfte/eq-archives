}you really should read something on that quest in more depth.  I finished
}that quest and you have to camp bixies at towers if I recall corectly.  any
}lone bixie not at the right location doesn't have a chance to drop that
}quest piece.  have to be at the right location.  and I don't remember the
}right location, look it up.  running around looking for solo's won't cut it.
}and I do remember it was in misty thicket zone near halfling city.

I got vastly more honeycombs in Kith than Misty.  But I've probably got 
them from just about every bixie spawn point there is.  They even drop in 
EC.
