Just last night I ended up buying the spell in baz for 800pp, after 
realizing the components (bazaar bought) would cost more than that for a 
single attempt. I probably should have just stuck with L20 pet til 29 as 
my pet hardly ever tanks for long doing needlites in EC. The extra hp 
isn't really worth it when the down time is for me anyway.
