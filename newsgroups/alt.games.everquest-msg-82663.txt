"John P David" <daddio45@yahoo.com>:

> the infamous Antisemite and heretic Marcion

     An often-repeated, never-supported accusation.  Marcion is
a critic of both Jewish and Christian orthodoxy, but he 
doesn't go after the Jews as a people, so he isn't anti-Semitic.
If you have good evidence to the contrary, I'd be very 
interested in seeing it -- but if not, then you really ought to
correct your mistake.

     You're getting your gnostics mixed up; or more likely, you
never had them sorted in the first place.  The idea that the
Creator is insane doesn't belong to Marcion.  It's found in the
Apocryphon of John -- a Sethian text.

     Right.  So Marcion and the other gnostics oppose Christian
orthodoxy as much as they do normative Judaism.

     Antinomianism is present in the synoptics, as well -- it's
also in Romans, Colossians, and Ephesians.
