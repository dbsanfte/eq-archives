I have a feeling that the work you will be doing is addressing envelopes to
five people and sending them each $1 and they will, in turn, put your name
on their lists and send you one dollar and somehow you get on enough lists
for the dollars to add up (or however that scam works).  Of course, it might
not even be that "legitimate".  I tend to think that no one could fall for
these scams, but today someone forwarded one of those "Nigerian inheritance"
scam emails and asked if he should send the money or not.
