Irrelevant, Sui. I also touch type (though my max is only around 60 wpm,
nothing to write home about) but unlike you I never got into the habit
of constantly specifying a channel on each line of text to keep my
various conversation and *cough* "cybering" sorted out. ;-)

When I log in, I'm usually in /guild first until we get a hunting group
together, then I'm in /group because that's who I'm primarily talking
to. If I see things in guild chat I want to respond to, I'll type in the
/gu at the beginning of the line, but for the rest it's nice to not have
to bother. Typing a "/1" at the beginning of every line of text during a
raid isn't the end of the world, but it would be nice to not have to do
it. One more thing to type wrong (and no, I don't touch type the top row
numbers very well, so my likelihood of a miss is higher there) and one
more hassle if I'm trying to get instructions out fast in the middle of
the raid action. I can live without it, but I think it would be a nice
feature, and I also think it should have been an obvious thing to
include when they released the change.  Hopefully it will go in soon.
