Well, as the highest mage in my guild I'm the one ending up casting Malo on
every giant in Kael that happens to pass by.
I build up by casting a small malo first before I hit it with my highest
one. Despite if any (or all) malo hits about half the time I get no faction
hits.

I've now got a lvl 4 nuke memmed just to grab the faction, and this is
needed besides dropping it's resistances significantly and a pet going
berserk on it's behind.

Bugged I'd say :-/
