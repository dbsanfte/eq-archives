Thanks for all the info, guys! Here's a link to a PDF file (2.8MB) from
Nvidia's site which shows that indeed the GeForce4 MX line is just above the
GeForce2 line in performance and slightly below the GeForce3 line.
http://www.nvidia.com/docs/lo/962/SUPP/NV_LC_02.05.02B.pdf They call the
GeForce4 MX line the "mainstream". It can be confusing, but I agree that it
probably wasn't Nvidia's intent to be deceptive. However, they almost
"caught" me when I saw a GeForce4 card for under $100! Sorry, Freeze, I'd
look for some way to RMA your MX card and get a new one.

I notice Nvidia doesn't even refer to the GeForce4 4200 on their site that
many people here recommend. I'll have to hunt around for that one, as the
GeForce4 Ti 4400 is still at $279 (on Pricewatch).
