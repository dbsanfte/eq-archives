Doing this is the best way to handle it. Many guild police thier own.
Some seem to be collections of idiots led by an idiot; two or three
examples come to mind. Most of the time, they give these dips some
slack, so don't expect a guild boot right away.

I have been known to kill even pawn I see outside the newbie zone in
Freeport just for faction, there is no chance any newbie will be able
to hunt there for long. Out in WC most newbies are too busy running
from the young kodiaks.
