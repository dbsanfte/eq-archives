I also suspect you are wrong about the economy, the current high prices
are a factor of time.  I suspect that the dearth of plat dropables will
keep most prices under 10k for quite some time, since most of the high
value vendorable drops will be turned into gear vs vendored.  Blue
diamonds will be the ONLY available resist gear until kunark starts
opening up and will hold their dominance well into Velious.

IF I wasn't well on my way into PoP and GoD, and plugged in with 2
awesome raiding teams, I'd be seriously considering switching, because
I love a level playing field.
