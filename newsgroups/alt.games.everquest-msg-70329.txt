Ping Fuzzlecutter's Formula 5000 (or name close to that.) Sold by Ping
Fuzzlecutter who hangs out in a tent out in the West Freeport newbie
hunting area so anyone can buy from him without worrying about guards.
Not all *that* expensive and lasts a loooong time. It's all my
characters carry for drink anymore. Looks like a purple flask of some
sort in the inventory, and stacks like water/food does.
