My 2 cents:

I'm at level 15 right now, and I often only group with one other individual (hi
Fenori!), but my job is very vital to us surviving.

Binds, healing, buffs and slowing mobs down is just some of the jobs I do.

The nice thing is that should I be required, I can still do some damage in
malee combat when/if I run out of mana.

Keep with your Shammy, I've enjoyed playing mine since I've hit level 14 and
received spells like Bind, Spirit Strike, Root, etc..
