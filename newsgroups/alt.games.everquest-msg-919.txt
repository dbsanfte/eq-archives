Nah, compasses can be bought from NPCs for about 5p (I believe...may be
less) and telescopes just aren't needed.

Disheartening, frustating.  Yeah, I know.  But once you get the basics down,
These Are the Best Days of Your Life.

After damned close to 2 years playing I still remember the first time I saw
rain.  I was a human ranger in Surefall on a hill and I stood there night
blind as I saw other folks running along the paths.

I remember my level 5 gnome magician's harrowing trip to Qeynos to meet up
with a friend.  Running through WC I dodged giants.  Through Kithicor (night
time safe then) I just followed the path hoping I didn't take a wrong turn.
I talked someone in Highpass into invis'ing and binding me because he said
the town was deadly to me (he was very high level, around 18!).  After
getting through that maze (I still hate that zone) and running down that
very scary and breathtaking ramp into EK I saw another giant to my left,
turned right and walked right into a lion matriarch, who promptly killed me.

When I reappeared in Highpass I ran, got my corpse, decided there's no way
I'm going to Qeynos, and turn around and attempted to run back home to
Faydwer.  In WC I was killed by a griffon...

...and promptly started swearing and deleted that character.

This was before "sow plz" and "can u tp me plzzzzzz?"  It was probably 2
months before I got my first sow and 6 months before my first teleport (that
was ultra cool to go from Freeport dock to the wizard spires in GFay inside
one minute :) ).
