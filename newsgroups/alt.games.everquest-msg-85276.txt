Since I see no one at the first level of responses actually answered
your question, I will.

When you /report someone, what gets reported is the text currently on
your screen, and their name gets attached to it for relative ease of
finding it.

Thus, it is important when /reporting someone to be sure the text you
want reported is visible, and hasn't been pushed offscreen. If
necessary, you can scroll back to their text to do the report.
