When grouped, I try to keep everyone buffed with SoW and the best of my Skin
Like series.  I also snare the Mobs and Damage Shield the tanks.  I will
ocassionally DoT, and DD mobs, and when it's mostly over I'll have some fun
adding my 12 points a shot at the backs of fleeing Mobs.  So far I haven't
had too many complaints, and the ones I got I took as constructive
critisism.  So far this seems to jive with the thread so far.

But...

What should a druid do when it starts going bad beside hitting the port
button?

For example: Mob (or an add) gets loose and starts whacking the enchanter.

    Do I root the Mob?  People seem to get ticked when you root  because the
rooted Mob fights to the death.

    Do I Melee the Mob in hope that eventually, it might stop laughing and
take me seriously?

    Do I nuke the Mob, and hope the Enchanter will Mezz it so it will stop
beating me to a bloody pulp?

    Do I damage shield and heal the Enchanter?  Or will the Damage shield
put the Enchanter higher up on the Mob's hate list, making it difficult to
taunt off?


Also, Memmed spells.  Anyone see anything glaringly wrong with this load
out:
    DD, DT, Root, Snare, Gate/Port, Damage Shield, SoW, Heal?

Thanks,
Frank
