I bumped into a few people who claimed you could do LDoN as early as
15th, and 18th? Citing the November 5th patch as the date...

Is this true... I just want to *know*. 

Has anyone done a LDoN here pre-20th. The best I've got is a cleric
who just dinged 20th and lost it during the adventure but was allowed
to continue.... so the limit appears to be when getting the adventure,
not during it, at least.
