The channel can be quiet for an hour at a time, and then fill up with 
constant chatter for an hour straight.

I find myself using it as I used to use guild chat in an extended family 
non raiding sort of guild; I ask questions, make the occaisional joke, 
or ignore it completely, depending on what I'm doing.  If I'm busy, it 
takes something extraordinary to get a comment out of me at all

Teapray got killed for the first time in a Plane and I didn't even 
twitch... because I was going flat out pet canni chain nuking -and- eye 
scouting for a 3 man LDoN run, my first.  Busy.  Should have turned the 
channel off but that would be too much work.

The number of people in the channel doesn't seem to have anything to do 
with the amount of chatter, either, I've seen more talk go on with three 
of us total than with 16 crowded in there and stacked like cord wood.

Rarely, I see someone say something and nobody responds. Maybe its 
rarely because I can't take it and will respond myself fairly soon, even 
if its just a "no idea".  But I'll also try asking people on my server 
for an answer if I don't know, and then put up whatever they think is 
right.  This kind of thing can be a real "force multiplier" since we are 
all mostly on different servers and have different information pools 
available to us; it doesn't filter so well for accuracy, though, since 
its hard to know anything about the source at two removes like that.

I'm waiting for the day when I ask a question in age and then see it 
asked in some other channel I'm in; so far it appears to be a different 
circle than anything else I'm in.

Splendid
