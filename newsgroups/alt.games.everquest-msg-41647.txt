Mayhap you forgot about Desert Storm (which I was a part of), We have the
ability to strike against SPECIFIC targets of any type. Our planes and
weaponry are not the crude clumsy weapons of our enemies. And we can and do
try to avoid hitting civilian targets in our wars, unless they are being
used as shields to protect their military resources.
Modern warfare is not the bloody slaughter that it was just a few decades
ago, unless we want it to be.
Please have your facts in order when trying to condemn the people wanting
retribution next time.
