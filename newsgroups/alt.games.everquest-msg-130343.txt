Quite a while back, I remember reading a great thread in this group
discussing cleric strategy.  People listed what slot they had what
spells in.  How you handle this and that situations.  When a CHeal is
appropriate.  I think several people had basically written essay's on
how to play a cleric well, over the course of this discussion.  And now
I can't find it in google.  If anyone remembers it and can point me in
the right direction, it would be much appreciated.
