Anyone else noticed that since the launch of SoL, food and drink in your
inventory doesn't last quite as long as it used to? I always use Fish Rolls,
a banquet size meal. Each FishRoll last 3 EQ days so a stack would last me a
long long time. Since SoL I have been eating them at  the same rate as a
Hearty Meal. ie. seems to last only 60% of the time it should. A few others
i've asked also felt the same.

Anyone else notice this?

Also, does SoW seem just that little bit slower than usual and do your buffs
seem to fade a little bit ooner than you expected.

All of the above factors can now be increased using Alt exp skills.
