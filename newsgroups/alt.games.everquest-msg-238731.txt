buy the evolutions  pack - $30 ...then it's $13 a month (first is free)

> what are your options?

you can do whatever you like -- mindlessly kill stuff, sit around and chat,
craft things (like mindlessly killing, but mindlessly backwards), go on
raids to get loot and solve puzzles and develop strategies

> at what level do you really feel like you are enjoying your investment?

depends on the class.....most classes it's around 30, some it's 50, others
it's 65....plus 'enjoyment' and 'investment' are relative =)

> how much time do you need to enjoy the game?

honestly, a lot.....

> what kind of system do i need?

you can get buy with anything decent....running dx9 is the only big
requirement, i believe...if your comp is more than 4 years old, you probably
aren't a gamer anyway =)

> what characters are the best to play?

depends on what you want to do......what do you want to do?

> can you buy the basic everquest and be content?

not unless you determine to be blissful by being ignorant of what everyone
else is doing =)

>
> really, just anything at all that comes to mind

dont bother playing unless you can make a serious time investment -- you get
out what you put in, so don't bother unless you can really do it right
