Bingo!

Course I had to dig deeeeeeeeep into my windows files to find IE, piece 
of trash that gates still manages to bundle into new machines (I could 
have sworn he got his wrist slapped for that?)

Not that I'm cutting edge, still using Netscape as a browser, but I do 
have a copy of Opera on here I use from time to time, trying to steel 
myself to switching to a real piece of ware that's not preceded by the 
word Bloat

Anyway, sure enough, somehow Work Offline had been clicked on.  Now EQ 
is happily patching itself.  I suppose I might as well go out to a drive 
in double feature or something... hmmm, suppose they have somewhere 
around here playing all three LOTR movies in order?  I bet I have THAT 
much downloading to do!
