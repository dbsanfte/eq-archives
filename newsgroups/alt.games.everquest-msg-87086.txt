 We'd have no problem fighting Dain in his own room if it wasn't for the
simple fact Verant gave him a dumb ability: Banish people he's mad at to
the well. So let's see... He banishes people to the well..  There's no
way back up (outside of CoH).. Yes, it makes perfect sense to fight him
down the well so that our damage dealers can get back to the fight. It's
not like anyone is taking advantage of geography since Dain can cleary
fight back down there once he shows up.
