I am actually quite happy with the Nexus, it was the idea of adding the port
to anywhere that got me started.  But, then, I personally find that having
to hoof it to far away zones is fun and exciting, it's why I explored so
many zones that I otherwise would probably not have visited.  I just think
there needs to be a limit to what they do, if they add in all the things
that various people want, then the ultimate result is something ridiculous
such as my previous post.
