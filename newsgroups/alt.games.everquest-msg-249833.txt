I suppose that would be ok.  I mostly play to spend time with my friends 
though, and I don't enjoy hitting the autorun key and waiting for the 
scenery to flow by.  So in general I think making travel easier is a good 
thing.  

Here's another idea I had.  Let the wayfarer's guild handle all your 
transportation to instanced zones, so you don't have to run there.  Then 
when you are dumped out of the instanced zone you end up where you started.  
It would prevent 5 of us sitting on our hands while we wait for the tank to 
run across Everfrost.
