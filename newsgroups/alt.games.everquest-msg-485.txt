The good was that I got basically a whole level yesterday
(which is good progress for me) and got to 39, with a new
set of druid spells.  We had a (mostly) good group in the 
kodiak caves, with good steady pulls and experience.

The bad was one of the worst druids I have ever grouped with.
His name was a mix of i's and l's.  My wife and I quickly
noticed that he did not do squat during battles, and NEVER
cast heals.  Twice, people showed up to group with us, but
this guy was the group leader and was AFK (w/o telling us)
so he couldn't invite.  He did do some buffing, but basically
this jerk was just soaking experience off us.  I would have
been happy to get rid of him, but the experience was quite
good there, and I didn't want to get hassled for "not sharing"
or get trained.

Oh yeah, and when we asked him to cast diamond skin he said
that he didn't want to (even though he was 41 or so) because
"his abjuration was poor".  I didn't think about it then, but
how on earth do you get to level 40+ with lousy abjuration????
Only way I can imagine is a combo of powerleveling and 
experience sponging.

The ugly was that it became clear that this turkey thought 
he was a great druid.

Ok, enough ranting, now I can go back to being happy to have
new spells :)
