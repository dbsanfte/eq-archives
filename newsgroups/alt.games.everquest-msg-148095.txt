No Reply from them. I don't think they care.

Xupiter directory has most of them. I turned off all Active X
controls. I also found out that Valueclick pages open cascade pages
which I don't think Allakhazam gets credit for. One popup open opens
another then those two open two more etc etc.

XTcontrol.dll was the biggest pain to get rid of. I downloaded
BHOdaemon and got rid of that too.

This is a tough trojan to dump.
