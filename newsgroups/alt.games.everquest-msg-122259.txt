I stop worrying about Int after I pass the 200 mark. I have seen lot's of
different 3rd party formula bandied about saying the 200 int cap has been
removed, is a "soft cap" and other nice and technical sounding theories, but
I base my decision on the most empirical of research methods, ie:

"The little blue bar doesn't move enough".

*coughs*

Below 200 int at half mana (I find the blue bar to be less than linear,
especially at each end) and directly after a med tic has kicked in I throw
on my Golden Effreeti Boots (9int). Nice healthy bar jump downwards. If I
repeat the same process with Int over 200 the downwards jump is not that
noticable. I have actually helped the guild out on a few raids with
twitching and corpse summoning now, and it has always been mana regen that
has been all important, not total mana pool anyway. The best item I have at
the moment in Blackened Alloy Medallion (Mana Conservation II) as it makes
twitching more efficient.

BTW - I still haven't become <that> proficient, and the guild knows it but
they drag me along kicking and screaming anyhows. I think they like the
comic relief of having a certified idiot along for the ride. I haven't
caused any deaths yet as I am too scared to do anything beyond twitch, bond,
summon corpses and send a no-taunt rogue pet in when requested.
