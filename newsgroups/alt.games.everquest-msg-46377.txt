That's fair as that is really what I was aiming for. Americans are new to
this. But my point above was that regardless, people across the world are
interested in our mental process, and what we are thinking.

50 years ago that would have been an issue, they have lived in a land they
have called home, and launched significant terrorism. Even Jordan clocked
their ass when they hjacked 3 planes and used Jordanian airports. Palestine
has used their plight to be terrorists. I believe that now. They still have
a beef and deserve a state, but until they act like it, fuck em. Yassir
Araffat was the biggest most active terrorist the last 20 years. Study some
history, I have, and felt like you until I studied those facts. The bottom
line is PLO=Terrorsim. Palestine deserves statehood and the peaceful people
deserve peace.

Bullshit. Study some history. Afghanistan has been the center of war
forever. Superpowers eventually used them as a buffer state to conduct
indirect wars. Afterwhich the USA has been the biggest and longest financial
suporter of Afghanistan. What happened is the extremist movement out of
Pakistan waged war with the leftover government and drove them out. Then
enacted laws that all of Afghanistan resented while the Northern Alliance
fled to the NE. The Current government of Afghanistan is a Pakistani puppet.
The idea is to fix old mistakes.

Right, just like we caught them before the 11th.

Fast as in jumping to conclusions, and wrongly pointing a finger. I guess
you didn't read my post above.

Not sure what your arguement is. You seem to be off on a tangent. My point
was the media immediately assumed Bin Laden was responsible for Oklahoma and
then corrected that.

Yes and so your whole train of arguement is moot for the most part. Why I am
even entertaining you is something I still wonder.

Ok so you prefer to pretend the government and the many nations who have
seen the evidence is lying. That's fine.

I post to these newsgroups. I care about those who post to them. I have been
posting to them for 5 years. If you don't want to give me the time of day,
skip the thread. I am sorry if you feel "annoyed". Someone taking
precautions to handle serious issues that could in fact help them and their
family survive, to me, takes precedence over your needs to not feel annoyed.

Sorry to hear, that. I can then also guess you don't have children either,
maybe even no feeling for other children (not making an accusation, just
carrying a thought). It's also apparent you only consider information and
data in the first person sense, meaning, fuck the world, I am a fatalist, I
don't care when I die, and I really don't give a damn about anyone else.
Therefore, simply passs this thread from now on. How can anyone give a flip
about what you think when you simply have admited you don't care about what
anyone else thinks as well as whether you or ayone else lives or dies?

Hedonistic attitudes don't help parents. It's sad if you represent a
majority of gamers. I respect your point of view and have responded point by
point to you, but it's very hard to give you as a person any credit when you
don't even care about yourself, and could care less if the world blew up 5
minutes from now.
