Yes and no.  There's a cleric on TP that I will NOT group with, I'd rather take
a druid or a shaman for healer over her.   And several necros and rangers that
I'll take *any* time because they are such good team players.  But I know what
you are saying.

True.  *But*.  I've played with rangers who really thought their job in a group
was to shoot arrows.  Clerics who did nothing but heal and sat around with full
mana in a dungeon full of undead.  Pet classes who send their pets into battle
and spent the rest of the time sitting on their butts doing nothing.  Warriors
who clearly never learned taunt.  They may not be playing *wrong*, but I'm sure
not going to be eager to play with any of them again.
I *prefer* to play with people who are truly having a good time being their
class.  Not the ones who put in the /lfg description: "experience grind".
