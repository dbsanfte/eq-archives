As I have nothing to prove, why should I care what you term, "double
standard"?

You and others have confused me with Avenger and GetsumJ.  I made it
abundantly clear when I entered this video game newsgroup *sic*.  I won't
attack unless attacked.  Seems to me this group's either:

A)  Hypocritical
-or-
B)  Too dumb for its own good.

What was so hard to understand?  It's a game, folks.  Quit taking it so
God-awful seriously.  Sheesh.
