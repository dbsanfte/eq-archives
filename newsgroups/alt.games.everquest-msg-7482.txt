No need to purchase it... It's just collecting dust right now and =

When you hit 20, that sword is gonna rock.  You will hit for 50+ and get =

    Hey getsumj... I play on Drinal too and can give you a shiny brass =
halberd for the little guy... he can either sell or use.  I've got a =

something else if he is logged in.

    Send me a tell when we are both online... I play a Troll SK named =
Bagbkabau.  All my old armor is too big for him.

    I actually saw you in Oasis the other night and sent you a tell =

      First of all, If you must bash, please pass this post by.

      My Son loves EQ and he is 9 years old. He elected to try a Human =
warrior cause according to him, "It sounded Tight" whatever that means.
      He is now a level 8 and works hard in groups. He will not let a =
group member die, and this gets him into trouble a bit.=20
       He has this bad habit of following others suggestions like going =
where lvl 8 Warriors don't have a chance of surviving.=20
       Now, I am a Level 19 SK and I can usually get him out of =
situations as I have done twice before. But this last time, he lost all =
the stuff (Chain Armor, Velium Sword and Shield, ect) that me and his =
older brothers have managed to get and give to him. Lesson learned for =
sure and I think after 2 weeks of no armor, he is showing more smarts.
       I have spent the last two weeks earning money killing Leggo's, =
Desert Madmen, and Willows so I could get enough to get him restarted.
       Thursday is his bday, and today I took the day off , signed on =
with his name and began the dangerous task of Drop Transfers.
       I did great and managed to give him my back-up Fine Steel Sword, =
Lots of leather, A Backpack,and some food.=20
       While changing a nice Kite Shield, and 27 pp, I found that it =
wasn't there after I dropped it. Guess it happens.

       Now, I have 10pp left and I really would like to get him some =
sort of Shield. Could some one steer me in the right direction of where =
I could get one for about that price ? (Freeport, WC,EC,Ro)

      Its totally different being a Dad as opposed to being "GetsumJ" =
the local mouth. And if you help me this one time, I will never bash in =
the NG again cause I am really trying to surprise him.

      And please, if you despise me, come kill me. Not my sons. That's a =
lil too personal.
