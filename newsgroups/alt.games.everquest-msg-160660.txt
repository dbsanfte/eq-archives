Well, for the Kaladim dwarves I think enough CHA would fix it, their
prices kept improving with each improvement I managed to my CHA, but
I never got high enough to get to the "standard" 5%.

For worse than normal "best" prices regardless of CHA however:
Try the HQ Ore (can't recall if that's the correct item, the stuff you
need to make the metal sheets for Fine Plate armor) vendor in Highkeep,
his "best" prices are worse than the standard 5% markup/markdown.  Also,
there is at least one vendor in South Qeynos, near the docks, whose
"best" prices are incredibly awful, 50% markdown on buying something
from you when he is amiable, same race, and you have a 110+ CHA.  Also
in South Qeynos, the female human vendor who sells the Silk Evening
Shirt is like the Ore guy in Highkeep, somewhere around 8%-10%, IIRC,
instead of the "standard" 5%.

Also, when vendors change their "best" prices because of negative
cash-flow, boosting CHA does nothing, you need to buy stuff from
them or wait for a server (or zone) reset.  But this doesn't happen
in too many places, presumably because the threshold is fairly high.
