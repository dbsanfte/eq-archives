fighting in Maiden's Eye tonight, i noticed that the mobs have some pretty
low MR

so i was kicking ass, as an enchanter does, showing off here and there

i'm guessing it was the showing off that did it . . .

puller comes with 2 mobs, i grab the slower one, go to mez, and it resists

sure, it happens, so i recast

it gets on me, i try to stun, it resists

sure, it happens, so i recast

resist again? ack!

someone rooted, i backed off, tash'd, went to mez

resist again? ack !

it was just a blue mob, same as all the rest, but it was not getting mez'd
anytime soon

what i want to know is --> WHY ?

its like i cast 100 perfect mezzes, and then i was completely cut off and
made worthless . . .


an hour later, out of the blue, i got the same thing to happen


now, i noticed when a goranga hunter spawns, it buffs the lessers (including
sow, i think)

do they buff other mobs too? or do all types of mobs have a buff mob that
spawns?

it was pretty heavily camped, so i would assume if there was, it simply
didn't get a chance to buff many mobs

anyone know what's going on? got any ideas?
