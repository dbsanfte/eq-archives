Another small point I have once, aske Biz a question and also got a
civil reply.

Although, I have to say that I do see some profanity that seems
unecessary to me, however since I am thick skinned, and can swear like a
trooper being Irish and brought up in Scotland, it doesnt really bother
me that much.

PS  Not all Irish or Scottish people swear, i didnt mean that ;)
