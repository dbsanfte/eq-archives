My guildies are still on a learning curve with the adventures.

They have to get out of the safe xp grind mindset and into 
a more aggressive mindset.  First thing I say when we get
an adventure and have new folks in the group -

"Follow me to the zone and do not, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES,
enter the zone until we say so.  All melee bind at the 
soulbinder, all casters at the zone entrance.  Do not, UNDER
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, mess with a box until we've won.  If
you die, immediately return to the zone, you will be rezzed
AFTER we win.  We will be chain pulling, so any bio breaks
and such - take 'em now."

The great thing about the dungeons is that, for 90 minutes
at a time I totally forget AA xp - it's great to be surpised
by an AA ding.  (It's also nice to end up with 200-300pp
in cash loot and a shot at drops during a run - my Solstice
earring is not +14int :)
