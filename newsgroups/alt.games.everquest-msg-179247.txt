Agree with Dark Jedi, though the server is down, after it has been up
for  a while it has a great word selection on merchants. I have found
the pet words there too. However it did take me two days to get them,
just keep stopping by and looking. Left hand side of zone along sea
shore are level 20-30 Mobs who drop those words which is why you find
so many there. BTW a great place to level your necro solo.

As for failure, happens, leveling my Shaman's alchemy and even though
I have a descent score I can fail three times in a row, just hurts
more when ingredients are rare. My advice for this is to put the words
in the book, take the book and head to The Nexus, Plane of Knowledge,
Plane of Tranquility; There ought to be a necro sitting around doing
nothing and ask if a necro with high research would help you out with
the pet spell. I used to press the button for other necros all the
time.
