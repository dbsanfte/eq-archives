I saw that too... I think someone (Monual?) posted a fairly sensible 
reason for grinding 70 before even heading to the new zones.

And for all that, I think its sad that there -is- a sensible reason.

At this stage of late game I think leveling post 65 should be more 
interactive than grinding. ie I think you should have to 'unlock' your 
levels in the new content via quests. The quests shouldn't be 
particularly difficult, and shouldn't require a quest, but they -should- 
take a few months to figure them all out. (And once figured out, can be 
completed by a half group in several hours each)

The point of this? Make getting to level 70 for the first timers an 
adventure in OoW instead of just a 20 hour grind in PoF.

It would be far cooler if people started hitting 70th a few weeks from 
now instead of 1-2 days after release.
