The level 5 cleric Stun doesn't do any damage - not sure what level
Paladins get this (15 at a guess?).  All of the others do (except the
level 55 cleric Stun Command which is a no-damage AE stun).

Stuns have a high taunt factor, even when they don't do any damage.
I'd say the taunt from being stunned is considerably higher than the
(low) damage the stuns do.

True.  However, stun then mez is a favoured enchanter tactic, since
stuns are in general very fast-casting and difficult to interrupt.
This buys the enchanter a breathing space to mez the target.
