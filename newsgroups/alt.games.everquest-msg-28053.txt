No kidding, but at least she HAS taken some precautions.  There's a lady
where I work who got religion a few years ago.  She's a sweet gal of 45 (or
so; she won't say exactly how old she is no matter how carefully you ask)
but she's a little too ignorant to make good decisions.  One scumbag took
notice of that and just sort of oozed into her life.  Everyone told her her
new boyfriend was a slimy, overbearing jerk, but she just didn't see it.
Blindly trusting that God had sent her the right man, she moved out of state
to marry this manipulative, domineering dickhead who, when he found out she
wouldn't completely submit to his every whim, put the divorce papers through
on her so fast it gave her whiplash.  Two months after she married this guy
she was back in her old run-down trailer with the same dead-end job she had
before, no husband, no money, and no car.  To make a long story short, if
you take precautions you are still somewhat vulnerable but if you don't you
WILL be hornswoggled.
