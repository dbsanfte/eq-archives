4th Warder, prior to the Sleeper having been woken anywhere.

They had 30+ there, and weren't a particularly small guild.  I was
playing a char on that server at the time, and Conquest had a rep as
the resident uber-bullies who did shit like crash other guilds' plane
raids hunting for twink gear.

They had some scam, never explained, that caused the warder to get
stuck on a bridge never moving, which they were using to buy the
time they needed to position themselves for the kill.  They were
able to keep agro on the unreachable and unsummoned MT (the guild
leader) most of the time, with a cleric occassionally getting
summoned and killed when they mistimed a CotH.  It was intimated (but
never outright stated) that they had used the same (or perhaps a
similar) pathing/AE/summonning exploit to kill the other warders.
