Yeah, that too. Although on Bristlebane, Malo was always a pretty
common spell. I could've had first dibs on 3 of them before reaching
60 and I don't raid all that much. Malo was always a 20k spell, Torpor
was 60+. 

Not to mention that I can think of at least one spot where all lvl 60
research words are relatively common,
