How do you test this? My level 13 necromancer has 210 int without trying
and my 38 druid has 225 wisdom or so... I'm quite happy to chuck gear on
and off in the spirit of testing, even with umbral style +15wis/int bracers
to make it clear, but the "its just a blue bar" nature of the mana pool
makes me unsure how to check properly...
