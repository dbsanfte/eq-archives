It's common once you get foraging up, and you can't get jack shit for it
because it's no drop and has to be combined with the 3 other forages in a
relatively hard to get container in order to do anything for the epic.
(yeah, it's also used in one of the crest quests for the Signet ring of
Tunare, in which case you combine it in some box with 7 or 9 other forages,
once again, jack shit)
