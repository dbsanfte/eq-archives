People can still fake eating.  They just can't do it in a way
that exactly mimics the "actual" eating and confuses people
into thinking that there's a real item in the game named
"a big slice of pizza" or whatever.

But anyone who wants to annoy other people, or who wants to "fake"
eating A Bag Of Cheesy Poofs, can still do it just like they
always have:

    /em takes a bite out of <whatever>

So please explain to me what point I'm "not getting".

People could be annoying with emotes before.  People
can still be annoying with emotes.  Even if they add
one more.

Please explain.

Fine.

But please explain what I'm allegedly "not getting" when
I point out that people who get a new animated emote
which simulates a Feign Death will not have the same
incentive to practice it that people who actually *have*
Feign Death have.

Yes, there will be some people who will use it annoying.
But they're the same people who will use the other 99
emotes at their disposal annoyingly, nothing is changed
by having one more at their disposal.

The annoying people will be annoying with or without
a new "/faint emote".

The FD people will still continue to practice actual
FD with the same frequency as before.

So what would have changed?  Please explain.
