Extortion carries a threat, subtle or overt.

What threat do you think Julie could even pretend to bring to bear
against Annie in either forum?

Translation:  "I'm attempting to grab the last word by pre-emptively
mocking any attempts to take it from me.

Am I wrong?  If so, is it not then equally plausible you and 42 were
wrong as well, as you have effectively done what I just did?

Your experience on usenet isn't very broad, I'd wager;  deep maybe,
but not broad.  There are plenty of folks who 'resort to insults' as a
matter of honesty rather than lost cool.  MSB, Terry Austin, sometimes
me.  

If you're acting like an addlebrained fuckwit, the members of that
group will tell you so; and bitching about it is the same as
pretending extortion is just good advice (albeit from the other
angle.)  Polite diplomacy is cute, but I like honesty better.

As am I, actually.  Your only obvious link to Rumbeldor is a hotmail
account, which are as cheap as oxygen.  I'm no better either:  my link
to 'kaos' is a freenet account, which is almost as cheap and
discardable, and I'm not even posting through their newsfeed.

Quite.  I'll admit I'm biased against folks going through anonymous
remailers, though.  Particularly if they've got the "Nomen Nescio"
alias; I've *never* seen a post under that name which wasn't lameass
trolling.
