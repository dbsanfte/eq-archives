  I never had to bring my own group to CC, always seemed to be plenty of
people there. And, soloing orcs isn't so hard once you're up to 35 or so.
  I've got two fighting batons, an adamantite bo stick. A couple of pieces
of crescent armor (slippers and sleeves). Wu's cape, pants and bracers.
Foremans tunic and lumberjack cap, and autopsy apron on my waist. Woven
frost giant beard (or somethingorother) on my face. Various jewelry (orc
fang earring, cougar claw earring, jagged band, +agi ring) gem inlaid
gauntlets. I'm probably forgetting stuff.
