I jumped in and helped melee when ever possible to max out Bash, Defense,
Dodge, and 1hb. Im still not a good dmg dealer with 1hb, but the main thing
is I have them all maxed. So if I get aggroed I don't get nervous at all.
With a high AC from plate and defensive skill maxed I can actually tank for
a sort time. I have tanked to a certain degree If group can not find one.
This is all optional of course and once you get to the planes or raids you
will never melee and doing so will probably piss people of seriously. I
think of it as just some less thatn secondary skill I had time to develop.
