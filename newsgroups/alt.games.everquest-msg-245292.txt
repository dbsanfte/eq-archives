It cuts down on trash clearing, and waiting for a named spawn.  This is
pretty essential, because with the rare ass drop rate, you need as many
named mobs as possible for even a chance to get your damn spell.

You still have to clear trash.. KILL the named (no easy feat).. and a
6minute lockout timer between missions

How exactly is it cheating?

Did you view it as cheating when people took Ldon Hard missions, tracked
named mobs, if not, dropped the mission for another?

I don't see how restarting a mission because a named is or isnt up is
considered an exploit/cheating. They did say they boosted the drop rate
(laugh), and now they just ruined any chance of people getting spells
basically.  The zones are nasty, you need a group of specialised classes,
dedicated for hours of freaking trash clearing just to get to the named, who
have a loot table of 2 random items (grats rot after the first drop your
twink loots), and a 1 in like 20 chance of a spell dropping.

Friend or not, who the hell wants to make your tank friend and melee dps sit
through week after week of that shit, for the ultra rare chance of a spell?
