Heh.  I dunno about Starbuck's, but the barista I'm dating looks damn good 
in a leather bustier. :)  She doesn't work for SB though.  Support your 
small locally-owned independent cafe! :)

}tea.  Tea doesn't need help from cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Tea has a

Don't they have tea?  Maybe I'm thinking of Peet's.
