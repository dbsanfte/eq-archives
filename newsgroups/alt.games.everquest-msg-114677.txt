FV, then.

Now I've got to say, the more I hear about it the more I'm really regretting
not signing up on it.  I went for Seventh Hammer because it was the one I
used to play on.  That said, there're several bad memories attached to SH
and I don't feel particularly attached to it.

But now I hear that FV doesn't have a common language?  I left Neriak in a
bit of a huff and came to Qeynos.  Everyone could understand me.  That's not
right, surely?  But you can't roleplay being new in town and not knowing the
language because most people just assume you're too stupid to know how to
switch languages.  "Try speaking Common, dimwit!" they'll shout.

*sigh*

I'll get to the point.  I like to roleplay in EQ.  It's probably escapism,
dissatisfaction with real life, possibly dangerous lack of grip on reality,
list usual string of trendy nonsense assumptions about people who play RPGs.
Hell, no doubt I'll take to the streets with a sword before long and hack up
some innocent passer-by, and run off shouting "Ding!  Level 2!"...  And
that's before we consider the fact that one of my characters is *gasp* the
Opposite Sex...  Probably some weird kind of perversion there, right?  :o)

I was getting to the point.  Try again.  My characters are none of them
terribly advanced - the highest being level 10.  But it would be such a pain
to have to start them again.  Is it possible those nice people at Verant
would consider porting them from Seventh Hammer to FV (whatever) so that I
can play EQ as something other than just a pretty number-crunching chatroom?
