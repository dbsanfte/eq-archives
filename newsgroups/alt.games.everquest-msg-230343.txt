I'd agree conditionally.  If they said something like "X is not Y", and I 
quoted them leaving out the 'not', and answered as if they'd said X IS Y, 
then yeah, I'd agree.  That'd be dishonest.  But I don't think it's valid 
to whinge just cos somebody don't quote the whole of what you've posted.  
It's all still there on the servers for days or weeks, and you can set 
most newsreaders to store messages for some time, and plus there's always 
google (if you wanna make sure everything you say's written in stone you 
just make sure you don't put in the X-No line).

Far as I'm concerned, quoting's to refer the reader to the PART of the 
previous post you're answering, and that's all.  If the reader wants the 
full kitten then they'll just have to click back a post.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
