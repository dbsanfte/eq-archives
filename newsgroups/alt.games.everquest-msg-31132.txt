Why on earth should he/she (still a bit hazy on this one :) quit the game
because some fool just has to have a wise ass name that at the end of the day,
'is' against the rules. I personally would rather not see 'Wantsomedrinks'
running around norrath. It's supposed to be fanatsy, im no role player  and
dont expect eberybody to be called gandalf or Bain the berserker but there is
no reason for choosing the name 'wantsomedrinks' other than being a prick who
wants to spoil it for others and get noticed, well he did get noticed, and
reported and then called himself a psycho analist and tried to defend his
choice! You cant even blame it on a lack of imagination as there is a perfectly
good name generator at the character creation screen and so, i conclude that
anybody with a name like that is an asshole, not entering the spirit of the
game and not respecting the others who wish to do so.
Sure its only a name, but if you saw a hundred 'wantsomedrinks' or
'nosowforjoo''s running around it would destroy the atmosphere of the game.
I dont know why i bothered replying to this anyway because youre probably just
another fucking troll.
