He does say what his source is for the EQ information, we cannot verify 
it, I'll agree with that.  I would imagine that if he disclosed who his 
inside source is they would likely not have a job at SoE anymore.  If SoE 
wanted to have the information out there, they would release it 
themselves.

And I say again, his numbers appear to track fairly accurately 
information that SoE has released in the past, or released after he put 
that information on his charts, including the information provided in the 
article that you are talking about.  Unless a verifiable source can 
refute his numbers, I see no reason to stop believing that they are 
reasonably close now.  The only discrepancy between what is said in that 
article, and his numbers would be if we accept 10k accounts per server.  
Given the way EQ is structured, I have no reason to believe there is any 
specific limit such as that on a per server basis.
