Try looking for people like me, Celaeno.

Back when I was in college, one of our labs was to mark the spectra of
various gas samples.  One of the samples was mercury.  So, I marked
out all the lines I could see.  After I handed it in, the instructor
asked me where I'd got the last 2 lines.  I told him that they were
faint, but there.  His response was that I couldn't have seen them;
they're in the near-UV range.  So, back to the lab and I reset to
those lines each time.
