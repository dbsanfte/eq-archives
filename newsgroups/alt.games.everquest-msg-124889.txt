I'm not going to make a direct accusation of anybody "bending the
rules". But the appearance of impropriety from CS by getting in anything
other than a "professional" CS conversation with any guild, particularly
one of the larger ones, is a bad choice.

Rather than jumping to conclusions, you might want to read logs and
check the facts before pronouncing judgement, James. Though it's good to
see that we now have a benchmark for how long it takes for somebody to
go from unguilded to "oooberd00d Tude" and it's apparently not long. The
Guides, and then GM's had already shown up and been made aware of the
situation. Two logs were posted of conversations with a GM (read... not
a Guide) who told cheese manufacturers that it was not an exploit, and
they could expect it to be changed, but for the time being things were
"working as implemented".

Now, Mr. Ubercleric, riddle me this. If you are a GM, (and a SWAT team
GM at that, not an appy or a guide) and you are on-site at this vendor,
what's your choice going to be? To tell the members of one of the
server's guilds to go station themselves there and keep killing the
vendor? Or to hit a button that you have readily displayed on your
console, permakill the vendor and replace with a "!" vendor, and let
everyone know why and head off into the sunset until the next patch?
<insert sound of crickets chirping here>

Ok. Now we've settled that. So, is it *also* your opinion that, right or
wrong in terms of what the VI CS final decision was, that a group of
players should make that decision and take matters into their own hands
for the other 3500 players on the server?

No. You shouldn't be at *ALL* surprised that a guild large enough to not
have to worry about their repution (IF we were talking about a whole
guild.. we're not) would do that. What you *SHOULD* be surprised at is
that a VI CS rep would NOT take action against a blatant violation of
the PNP when petitioned. This is exactly ZERO in difference to somebody
who keeps killing the banker so nobody can bank in player terms. It's
VI's responsibility to fix these things. Not the players.

That said, that particular guild has a ton of members, and several of
them are great guys that we hook up with regularly. This was only one
asshole (with a couple friends) who was already known for being a
dickwaver in any opportunity. (RL teenager, so not that surprising) and
not the whole guild. But the guild in question isn't going to sanction
him like any lower tier guild would, and their statements on guildboards
aferwards have been as predicted. (e.g. "Oh, get over it. It's one
vendor. Stop living in the past." etc. etc. etc.)

End of fucking story.
