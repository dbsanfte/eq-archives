This was always my problem with raids. Not living in the US they
usually start late, so, say they start 2am my time. If they started
then, that would be fine, but it never does.

Normally what happens is about 2am they start collecting, by 3am most
will have arrived, by maybe 4am everyone is grouped and a strategy is
beginning to form....

By this time Im often beginning to phase in and out of wakingness

A classic one then went

Raid starts, everyone gets wiped, takes them 90 more minutes to sort
out a few more joiners in, rezes, etc..

Basically at 6am the raid started... I think I failed to zone.. I
think my comment was zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

which reminds me.. I need a hate raid for my epic .. didnt drop last
time.. grr
