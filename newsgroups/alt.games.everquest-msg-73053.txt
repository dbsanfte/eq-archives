/agree

Any site which solicits donations really should state up front and
explicitly for what the funds are to be used. If eqtraders didn't
do that, shame on them.

On the other hand, if I were making a donation to them
(I use eqtraders regularly, and did not, so shame on me)
and was informed that part of their proceeds were going for
the personal benefit of the site maintainer, that wouldn't
bother me one bit. The people who put hours of their time
into these sites which save *me* time certainly deserve it.
