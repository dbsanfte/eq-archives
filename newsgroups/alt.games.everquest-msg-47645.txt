One of the first things I do in a group is ask the class/levels.  As I'm
waiting, I'll start tapping F2-F6 and "c" to con them.  If they're green,
I'll be sure the group is aware that someone might be losing xp in the deal.
My reasons for wanting to know class/levels are that I try to keep an eye on
agro by guessing which caster can outdamage me (etc) so that I have an idea
of how often I can evade safely.

Last night, I ended up grouped with a twink-rouge of an uberguilder.  He was
saying that a friend went into KC with a 25 Ench (anon) and got a group just
to try to leach some xp.  With level differences like that, I doubt he got
some but it gives you an idea how shifty and lazy some people try to be.
