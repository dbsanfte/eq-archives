I have mentioned this before, I'll do it again.  You DO NOT have to 
remove your security to load one activeX app.  Set IE to prompt you about 
loading activeX, load it, set it back, if you really must, to not allow 
activeX at all.  Personally, I always leave it set to prompt, always 
have.  Doing this, at no point in time leaves you vulnerable to a 
surprise activeX app suddenly loading onto your system, however miniscule 
the chance of that having actually occured while you had your "door 
unlocked".  To, continue the analogy, you are installing a doorbell, that 
must be rung prior to you letting someone in.  If you get tired of it 
ringing, you can always remove it later.
