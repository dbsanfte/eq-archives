This is a way to generic statement. This might hold true for any easy 
accessable experience grinding areas (LOIO, DL, etc), where you can
easily flee and  get back. At high level, where I now run around in
areas like Howling Stones, where it takes a long time to get to
areas through one way doors, the story is different. Nobody gates
there, simply because you can not get the people back in (unless you
have a CoH capable mage with you and the area allows that). In such
cases, *everybody* tries to do whatever needed to allow the cleric
to camp (camp by sitting interactively .. any cleric doing /q should
be spanked). That means you have to hold a wild bunch of mobs for
a full 30 seconds, which can be hard. Everybody is supposed to die,
because rez is most commonly the only way to get easily back where
you were. At high elvel 96% rezzes, the impact is small (unless
you die every 5 minutes, but then you are doing something wrong).

>>more than 1 mob, he will gate out of there. Personally, I would think

This is stupid, if the chanter has enough mana to rez some mobs and there's
not an insane amount of mobs. I have been in groups surviving the 
insanest onslaughts, where I also thought 'shit!', but we simply made it,
because the cleric could get just the mana back to get off another CH,
saving us an hour of CR, which woul have been 2 hours, if people gated
off to their various bind points.

If you are bound just outside the dungeon and the camp spot is relatively
easy to reach, nobody should mind a gate if the whole group is really dead
anyway (I mean you see 4 corpses .. not panicking because you 'think'
nobody survives).

Clerics are a needed class. He would easily get onto my don't group with
list fast, though. The least you want is unreliable key classes.

True .. all I said is only my opinion .. your mileage may vary :)
