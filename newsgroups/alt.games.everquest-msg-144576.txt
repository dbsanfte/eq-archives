Well, if you insist on ruining the joke...
It depends on where you go.  If you're an American and you're at
a popular tourist destination you are pretty well assured that you
will, from time to time, encounter arrogance and discourtesy that
live all the way down to the stereotype.  On the other hand, in
Normandy at least from my personal experience, you can encounter
hospitality to rival that anywhere in the world.
