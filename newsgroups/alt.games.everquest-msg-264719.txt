The difference tho is that back then you could see the numbers for each 
server and know exactly which had the highest population. They've wised up 
to that by now. Whatever caused the initial high population on Fennin Ro, it 
was self-perpetuating and self-escalating for the reasons that you mention. 
That's what they're trying to avoid now by not giving anyone any reason to 
congregate on any particular server, they want a random distribution.

They've stated that there are no plans for a different rule set and I 
imagine they're tired of that game anyway so I'm not expecting it nor is 
anyone really asking for it.

Well, that hasn't been my experience. I played at release on E'ci and saw 
that server evolve until Quellious was launched and then moved there for 
some time. Long enough to become the first blackmith on Quellious selling 
Banded and then GM Jewelcrafter. My experience on FV has been qualitatively 
different. Doesn't mean there weren't morons or dewds there, but I sure came 
across fewer. Same phenomenon on CoH. Every server has its dewds and its 
immatures, but the likelihood of running into more interesting and less 
offensive characters on CoH's RP server was demonstrably higher than on the 
server where I started. You could gather every night in Atlas Square and 
enjoy a public gathering that was unlike anything I ever experienced on my 
other servers.

I don't think the difference was as dramatic in EQ, probably because the RP 
server had a different ruleset that independently attracted people who had 
no real interest in roleplaying, just an interest in the virtual absence of 
NODROP, for example. You may be right and in the long run it might make no 
difference. All things being equal tho, doesn't seem like it would hurt to 
try.
