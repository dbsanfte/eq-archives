    Lenny Got lenny :)

   Lenny plan kill all the human types as soon as I lvl up so someday
the newpe zone will be SHORT a few guards and some if not all the shop
keepers.

NOTE! killing the guards in EFP and WFP gets you in good with the guards
in NFP (were the bank is).

              EVIL IS THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY
                  DEATH TO HUMANS
                     (monks don't count)
                            Lenny
