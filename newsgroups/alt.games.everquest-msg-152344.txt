    Song of the Highsun casts some flavour of cancel magic on a mob twice,
then Gates it back to its bind point. You have tracking. If you were the
curious sort, you could (depending on the song's recycle time) Gate the
wanderer back to its spawn point, then track to it until you ran into it
coming to kill you. Keep doing this, running towards it at Selo's speed,
until you can see where it's being Gated to. Then kill it and mark the spot.

    If you were really thorough or bored, you could (a) sit at the spawn
point and kill the repops to time the respawn and to figure out that spawn
point's spawn table, and (b) follow the mob after it pops with Invis up to
plot out its wander path. That's the sort of thing that my buddy does from
time to time. He once refuted my claim that GFay was a dark hole to level up
in with, "At loc X, there's eight bat spawns in a circle around a hill..
They respawn in time Y, can be rounded up from these relatively short wander
paths when you first run here, and no other wanderers path nearby. What more
could you want?"
