I was not trying to get pissy or sound as if I was.  But it appeared as if
he did not read the full post (which you either were unable to due to not
getting the original post, or did get it but failed to read it as well,
specifically the FIRST SENTENCE).  However just to ensure you do understand
what I am asking & why EQWindows won't work, I'll quote the specific parts
of the original post, although the subject of the post should have also
actually been paid attention to, mainly the 3rd to 5th & the last
words/abbreviations.

Sentence 1 of first paragraph asks the question: "Is it possible to shut
down EQ while AFK?"  That is a REALLY good trick to be able to minimize EQ &
surf the web while AFK (AWAY FROM KEYBOARD).

Sentences 2 & 3 of the 2nd paragraph state the reason: "Since now ALT+TAB
gives the "crash to desktop" effect (EQ COMPLETELY closes since you can't
get back in anyway), has anyone experimented with using this as a way to
program EQ to close at a certain time?  This is useful if you're in the
Bazaar as a vendor, and need
some automated process done while you're AFK, such as recording a TV show
with your capture card."

The remainder of the 2nd paragraph explains WHY EQWindows or any other "keep
EQ running while doing something else" software would likely not work.  They
state that the video card would almost 100% guaranteed to NOT be able to
handle the task mentioned in paragraph 2 sentence 3.
