Could be that the supplier who built your system has not upgraded to latest
drivers.

Run windows update and see if windows wants to upgrade to DirextX 8.1, that
is most likely to be the problem.

Also try going to options at the connect screen to make sure it selects
correct GFX device and then turn off all models, then see if you connect

If not post your system spec so we can see if we can offer some advice.
