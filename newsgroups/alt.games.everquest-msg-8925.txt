No, because (roughly), the experience a mob gives goes up as the
square of the mob's level, whereas the experience your character
needs increases as the cube of your level.

Furthermore, there are additional "kickers" that further
increase (as a simple multiplier) the amount of exp needed to
ding at higher levels.

For a good "look-see" overview of this, see:
    http://eq.stratics.com/crmaps/eqexp.shtml

HOWEVER, be aware that this page has not taken into account the
patch a few months ago which eliminated class-based experience
penalties.  But it is still a good place to get a feel for how
many mobs of a given level are needed, roughly, to ding a
given level, and why.
