Get a regen BP it's awesome for a newbie iksar. when I did my Sk you'd
see my health go up while fighting. With that and good weapons SK can
level very fast. I got to 45 in no time flat and never teamed once!
But helps to either have Sow potions orthe boots. Don't bother much
with skeleton pets till your high level. The low level ones are
useless.
