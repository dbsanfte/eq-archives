I'm not at all sure what you are talking about here, but it's a
fact that bin Laden has not been going around talking about
the oppression of Palestinians for all his life - what he *has*
been doing is talking about the corruption of the House of
Saud, and his desire to drive the Americans out of his
homeland and establish a "truly muslim" society there.

The fact that I think his idea of Islam is all fucked up is
neither here nor there.

But, I'm judging from his history - he's never targeted
Israel before, he's consistently gone for the US.  He's
focused on revolution in Saudi Arabia, nothing else.

Of course, there was some dancing on the streets of
Palestine the day after 9/11 - but that's nothing but
schadenfreude, because America are seen as the strongest
supporters of their enemy, Israel.

But, Yassir Arafat never supported bin Laden.  He condemned
9/11 the day it happened, without hesitation.  You might say
he learnt his lesson from supporting Saddam before - but
however cynical you think his motives are, he was on the
right side over that one.

In another breath, you'll probably be telling us how there
is no unity amongst Arab nations, that Jordan and
Syria have fucked the Palestinians over too.  But, right
now, you're taking bin Laden at his word when it suits
you to bash the Palestinians with something they had
nothing to do with.

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
