    My apologies if I've misread. But I'm having trouble with this part of
what you wrote: "Still way under par."

    Way under par for what? There's three "real" slowers in this game
(sorry, Bards, you don't count): Shamans, Enchanters, Beast Lords.

    An enchanter raises the recovery rate for healers with Clarity-line,
slows to 70%, hastes to 60% plus ATK mod to help kill faster, doesn't
contribute in most situations to killing the mob. That's how an enchanter
mitigates damage.

    A shaman raises the recovery rate for healers with spot heals
(Chloroblast/Tnarg's), slows to 75%, hastes to 60% plus ATK mod (mostly from
+STR) to help kill faster, contributes a small amount of damage
(clickables/pet). That's how a shaman mitigates damage.

    A beast lord raises the recovery rate for healers with SP/SD and their
mana regen AA and with spot heals (Chloroblast), slows to 50% commonly and
60% with PoP spells, hastes to 50% plus ATK mods, and contributes damage at
the same rate as any other common damage dealer in the group, which adds
roughly 25% to the total damage output of a standard-build group (healer,
slower, plate tank, three damage sources).

    So what is "way under par" about BST mana regen? It's the second best
mana regen buff line for others in the game, third best when you add in the
non-persistent mana song. It's not negligible in terms of total recovery
from damage taken, given the other things a BST brings to help mitigate
damage. It's the second best mana regen buff for others in the game, and
third best effect (behind C-line and mana song). Where is the "sub-par"
part?
