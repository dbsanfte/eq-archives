That's a pretty silly comparison. A cleric who can't heal would cripple the
class 100% and make most higher end enounters impossible. That's hardly
the same as not being able to port, which is just a nice thing to have.

You druids can still solo very well with luclin and you got very heavy
nukes.
Not even a *nuker* class like mages got nukes as hard.

That hurts a lot of other classes just as well.

You complain about being able to out-experience any other class at lower
levels through quad kiting, but want the same piece of cake at higher
levels. Druids are more of a solo class, which was your decision.

Druids can replace clerics at many exp camps at high level. If your other
people are doing well and all, your 900+ heal is good enough for most
things, combined with group regrowth etc. People just have to get a bit
more known to that.

That's the case at many locations.

Your basic complains are, that a druid doesn't fit groups well. But you saw
all the class reviews etc, saying, a druid is more or less a soloer and
outdoor person.

> I understand Verants desire to promote grouping, and druids tend to solo.
I

Not really. The druids don't *tend* to solo, they are a soloer class in most
cases. Talk to a necro about your complaints.
