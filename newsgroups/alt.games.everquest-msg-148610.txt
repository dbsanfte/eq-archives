Well, speaking as a 36 Shaman- I'm learning that good AC is your
friend.  The more protected- the less bashing you take when you are
aggro.  My Wis is around 190...happy with it (got Cannib after all).

One shield I carry with me is the Sarnak Battleshield...AC25 plus some
stats...I swap it with my Wis Shield when I'm suddenly surrounded.

On an Offtopic note:
I'm painfully learning that too much Cannib is a bad thing...died just
tonight because of it.  Mob aggro'd me- couldn't shake- was at about
40% health...insta death :)

What also didn't help was hunting with two 50+ guild members...All
Mobs red to me and hated my guts. But what the heck, it's the
Adventure that matters- and I'm hunting places I couldn't hunt before.

Cya!
