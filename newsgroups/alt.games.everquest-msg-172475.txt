If you go into the bazaar you can set yourself into trader mode and sell
stuff in your inventory (in the right containers anyway). If you have a
second accoount and a broadband connection you can effectively setup a
permanent trader in the area on a low spec second machine, or use your
main machine whenever you arent actively playing.

They are recognisable by having a light blue name, and the word Trader in
front of it....and you use them as if they were a normal vendors
