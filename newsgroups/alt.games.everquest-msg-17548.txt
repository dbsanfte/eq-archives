I believe that the max xp you can get for *anything* is capped at
something like 1/2 a yellow bubble, to stop you gaining 10 levels or
whatever by PLing your level 1 twink to kill a level 40 mob.

When PLing, you may as well pick something 3 or 4 levels higher than the
PC as something 20 levels higher - you won't get any more xp from the
kill.
