Outside of some issues in GoD where some trial bosses and single-
groupable nameds were nigh untankable by knights I don't think this
was much of a problem.  And I don't see how they could have fixed
the Warrior group-desirability problem any other way, short of a
complete overhaul of the game.  They spent years painting themselves
into that corner, and then they spent a year or so making really
stupid attempts to fix it that allowed highend Warriors to perform
fine (dual-wielding weapons with good +hate procs and Anger/Ykesha
aug procs while they had the AC and HP to withstand unslowed mobs
more than long enough for safe debuffing) while leaving the bulk of
Warriors SOL unless they had very good friends.

Also it made it a whole lot more fun to play in a group that has 2
or 3 tanks in it.  Aggro hand-offs no longer involve the knight
puller turning off attack after slow lands and stupidly allowing the
mob to beat on him until the Warrior gets Taunt to work or gets a
lucky proc or two, and a Warrior who is a couple levels lower than
the group's knight MT can actually contribute to reactive crowd-
control instead of being just sub-standard DPS.

The problem lies in the game design.  Knight spellbooks are far too
powerful in ways that have nothing to do with tanking (and Paladin
stuns, which are great for tanking, are way overpowering and thus
have always been nerfed to near uselessness vs. most challenging
content), while Warrior strengths have always been focused solely
on tanking.  That's why there are always problems with tank balance.
If knights can't tank they offer very little to groups in comparison
to other classes, but's it's very difficult to design single-group
content that is challenging to both Warrior and knight tanks (and
EQ's designers have failed more often than not in their attempts to
answer that challenge).
