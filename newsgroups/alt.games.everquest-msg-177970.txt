Oh, guess that's what happens when you simply listen to rumors.  I apologize
for my statement then.  My only excuse is that I was going on partial
rumors.  At most what I was trying to do was show that Test IS actually a
stable server (in the case of characters and items at least) and to not be
afraid of the rumors of constant character/item wipes that tend to be touted
around.

Again I apologize and retract my statement.
