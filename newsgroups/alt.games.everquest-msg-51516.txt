Actually I know a better one, the bone chip then fire beetle eye quest
with xelha in freeport east. You can start it at glower and
surprisingly few characters are threaten or below by default. My wood
elf druid of tunare was threaten but my brell paladin dwarf and Barb
shaman of tribunal were glower and could do the quest. Of course troll
sks or ogres can too even though they start at glower or apprehensive.

That is the most power leveling quest to do on a new server, more so
than the dwarf paladin guild variant in kaladim. Its even better for a
dark elf to run over to east freep to do this before it can be bound
even since the odds are kind of against it dying in the freeport newb
area by level 2 or so and the 1 gold per four bone chips is nice. 

The great thing is you do the bone chips until amiable when you can do
fire beetle eyes (too bad they don't stack) and you can buy unlimited
fire beetle eyes from the erud lady in EC at that far inn (or right in
nro murrissa sandwicher usually has quite a few newb sold ones. I got
a dark elf cleric to level 14 quite fast that way.. especially once
she could gate back to east freep after buying the beetle eyes. Of
course its easier if twinking but as a newb you'd be killing for the
bone chips and beetle eyes anyway. Oh and she takes spiderling silk
also.

Its really mainly better than the lightstone one because bone chips
stack and are of course cheaper. My druid bought out gfay newb lift
vendor of as many as 220 at a time and dropped them for my dark elf to
use. It lowers north freep pally guild but only a small amount really
even with hundreds of chips (you won't go below glower anyway since no
murder faction hit, and if a dark elf already at threaten you still
will be so not any harder to raise)

My wood elf druid found she could even do this herself in wolf form,
now she is kindly to dismal rage and nearly not kos to opal dark
briar. So the only freeport sewers person who is scowl to her now is
the dark elf lady on neriak cleric guild faction but she is green.. so
I'm not sure if she can attack. Of course the xp from the quest is
pointless by the time a druid gets wolf form.
