: Just suppose i have all crappy items(except weapon which is a Putrid Fish

Of course, crappy is different to different people.  Some think cloth is
"crappy" and others think Thurg quest armor is "crappy" and others feel that
if they don't have equipment from Plane of Time only, that is "crappy".  So,
basic advice only.  Get your Int to 200, then get as many HP's as you can.
HPs equal mana for necros.  If you have 1200 HP (You would need to ignore
STA and HP gear) at level 60, your Arch Lich will take you out in about 2
mins if your are not careful, and the spell can last up to 20 mins, iirc.
So, shott for 2500HP and 200plus Int.  Then resist gear is what I would go
for.
