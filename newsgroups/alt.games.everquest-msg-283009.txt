Personally I'd go for this one and bring potions.  With mage DS you
can do alot more damage, you've got tanking ability, good aggro
management (for when your mage goes ape with the nukes), and a less
focus-intensive class.  Boxing a chanter (if done well) should be
about as easy as boxing a bard...
Shaman, everyone does that.
Necro, anything added will hold you back.
Beastlord, what gimps.  forget that class.
Rogues, never get to BS cause you're the only PC in melee range.
Ranger, hmm, maybe.
Berserker, great DPS but not a tank.  still possible with Mage DS's
and potions.
Paladin's, better healing than SK's but less damage output.
wizard, well DPS is important....
