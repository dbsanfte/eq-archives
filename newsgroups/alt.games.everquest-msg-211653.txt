Well, there are two minor problems here.

1) God also gave his creations free will.

2) Satan uses the very free will God gave his creations to, as you put it,
degrade God's work ... and he does it every chance he gets.

A lot of folks tend to look at everything in the world and see it all to be
what God does (or has done).  Give the Devil his due ... he's back there
clicking the 'Undo' button as hard as he can.

You have to look at both sides here.  Y'see, there are two sides to every
Schwartz .... ;-)
