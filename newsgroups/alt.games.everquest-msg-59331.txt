I'm a level 30 necro on Antonius Bayle.

I realised that I'd had most of my equipment for about 10 or 15 levels now
and it was time I upgraded it a bit. I have a nice Advisor Robe that I was
given for helping a high level character out, and shadowbound gloves and
boots. And a few very low end +INT rings and earrings.

I was looking for suggestions for items I could get myself rather than buy
as half the fun is in getting them.

Today I went to upper guk looking for gatorscale arms. Suprisingly when I
got to the place, the ancient croc was there. It wasn't an easy fight solo
at level 30, but not the worst I've had and amazingly it dropped the arms
first time. They seem quite nice for me at my level with their +4 INT.

Anyone got any other suggestions for things I could get?
