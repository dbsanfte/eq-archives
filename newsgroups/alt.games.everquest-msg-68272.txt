Throwing is going up fast now that I have my pet; I find a
light blue mob that might drop quest parts, sic pet, and spend
the whole combat tossing in daggers.  BW, on the other hand,
requires more effort, I don't often get hurt bad enough to use
bandages and when  I do its usually not in an area where I can
afford to sit still that long instead of using IF.

Any word on the max cap for HtH?  Castersrealm lists it
at the intolerable 100 level...
