All the towns have a community sewing kit, so you can make the legs and tunic,
thats the cheapest way. But youll probably start with the easier items, that
just require the 8 slot kit.
You can also see if you can find a player that sell the deluxe kits. When VI
changed the large sewing kits from 10 slot to 8 slot, then had to find a
solution to everyone that had the 10 slotters in bank/on them, so all the
existing Large kits became Deluxe Sewing Kits. They have 10 slots. And just to
repeat it again, the Deluxe Kits are NOT vendor sold, theres always some rumor
about it going on, but theyre only sold at vendors if some player have been
stupid enought to sell it.
