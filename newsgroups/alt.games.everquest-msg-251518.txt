Or maybe I the gun shows I occasionally visit work differently? Point
taken though, it would have been a lot more accurate to say that you
pay a premium for the privelege of being able to return it

And no set of numbers ever will. Your level versus the mobs level,
your attack versus the mobs defense, buffs, debuffs, mob facing...
They all come into play when you start parsing. 

That still doesn't alter the fact that there's a broad consensus out
there about how to determine the most effective weapons, and those
numbers, relatively speaking, hold up in _MOST_ situations. What makes
you think parses from SOE wouldn't be any different?
