Actually, Chorkie, I believe it's going on as if you know
stuff about the game that you don't, and acting as if people
who correct you are somehow out of line, while arguing
that your own personal outlook concerning the game is
the only one because, well, it's your own personal outlook,
damn it, which earns one the title of idiot.
