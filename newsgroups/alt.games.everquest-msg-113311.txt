Dying in Vox or Nagafen's Lair when you are 53+ when they are
not up and then trying to get your body back when they are.
Need a corpse summon or wait til they get killed.

Dying in any of the planes is always NOT fun.

The absolute worst has to be Dying at any time Veeshan's Peak. On my
last day of EQ I would go on a raid there, maybe.
