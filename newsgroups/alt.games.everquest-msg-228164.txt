No, one-sided, senseless PvP expressly for the purpose of griefing.
There is no challenge to killing someone who's so much weaker than
yourself. There is no chance of the victim even putting up a
reasonable fight. The purpose is to give the victim a hard time. Yeah,
some people find that fun, but it's still ruining the fun of others,
and still a very shitty thing to do. People usually say they like PvP
for the challenge of human opponents. Where's the challenge in killing
someone who can't fight back? Where's the challenge of an unfair
fight? Also, "vulture" style PvP, where someone hangs around and
finishes a guy off who's almost dead after a fight with a mob.

"But that's tactics!"? That argument can be made, but some tactics
shouldn't be used in a game. The game is there for EVERYONE'S
enjoyment. Not just yours or any other single person or group of
people. If your idea of fun is to ruin the fun of others using cheap
and unfair tactics, you don't belong in the game.
