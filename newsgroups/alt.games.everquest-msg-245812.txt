No, but some mobs are flagged as "uncharmable"

Mob agros, you dont lost your DC

Not if it works.

Dc pets also have faction. Mobs will proximity agro on the pet.
You cant summon-companion a DC pet.
DC pets generally have bad resists. Animations are much stronger on resists
(assuming you have the gear yourself)

Yes.

Yes


DC pet is good in a group. It has nice dps. It isnt so great for soloing,
cos you spend a lot of time waiting around for it to heal. Some DC pets heal
better than others.
Grimling Soothsayers make excelent soloing pets. Also the undead knight
things in Veksar.
Some zones have high dps DC pets....
Kael guards dual wield for 169 damage. NTOV pets double attack for 220's.
Pets in natimbi hit for 180's.
Pets in tier 1-3 planes hit for 149. Some dual wield (like the rats in COD)

DC is no use in ldon's. beter off with animation empathy if you do a lot of
ldon's.
If you like to sit in BOT or POV all day then DC pet is great.
