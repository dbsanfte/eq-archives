Shissar is the biggest bottleneck.  Bigger than the old Ragefire in one
regard...you have to have a force that can at least break Fear at a moment's
notice.  Or you can luck out like I did (I didn't find out until later how
lucky I got).  Keeping the FGs cleared was, admittedly, a pain in the ass
for anyone but a raid guild, so maybe it's 6 of one, half dozen of the
other.  Besides Ragefire though, Cleric epic is, god, a freaking piece of
cake...only like 8 steps (as opposed to 20+ steps for enchanter), so
although I do feel sorry for Clerics, I don't feel TOO sorry. :)

Hate is annoying, but on Zeb one guild I know had *3* drops (can drop off of
ANY revenant, not just female...mine was from a male), and when I went for
mine, *2* dropped.  Hate is also much easier to break than Fear.

Verina requires just one minor group.  One 55+ warrior, maybe another melee
(or a couple 50+ tank-types with more healing support) and add a few
others...Verina isn't at all difficult, she didn't seem at all MR, FR, or
CR.  She's annoying because you have to park a spy there and check it
regularly, but that's it.

Vessel in Cab is more annoying because he is a Kunark creatures (more HP).
He really does need a decent tank, and I can't recall getting a spell off on
 him.  Plus, his spawn spot is harder to find than Verina.   He's a little
easier than Tangrin.
