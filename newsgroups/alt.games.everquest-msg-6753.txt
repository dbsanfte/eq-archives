First thing you should do is read through as many messages in the
Newsgroup as possible, because they'll usually give you some indication.
The problem that you are experiencing is due to a patch running on the
servers today. Patches run once every 1-2 weeks, sometimes more often if
there are serious bugs that need to be fixed. The "congestion" message
is just a generic message saying that the program can't find the server.
Today's patch started at 3am PST(-8 GMT) and is scheduled to run for 9
hours, which would put the ending time at 12pm PST. Figure there's
probably another two hours left from this point.

Also, the best thing you can do, when you can't connect to the servers,
is go to http://everquest.station.sony.com/netstat/downtime.jsp This
page gives you the listing of all the scheduled downtimes, usually a day
or two ahead of time.
