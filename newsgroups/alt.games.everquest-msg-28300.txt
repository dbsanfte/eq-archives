The cookware was a good idea. A minister should also have some
contacts with a master baker who can supply a wedding cake, and
maybe a magician who can summon some Bristlebane party packs for
the reception. ;-)

If you plan to stock up on wedding
gifts ahead of time, check around for low-level quest items that
have a unique twist of some kind. For instance, the Barnacle
Breastplate is easy to get for anyone over 15th level and it has
a unique sea-green color.(You might need the help of someone
with good faction with the Deepwater Knights.) The Kerran Fishing
pole, that happens to also be the fastest 1hb weapon in the
game, should be easy to get for a 30-something character.
A Kerran doll or Gnomish toy for the "little ones that are sure
to come" would be funny as well.

Basically, when you're sick of the experience grind and looking
for a diversion, go find a quest you've never done before and
save the resulting item for your "giveaway" pack. You don't even
have to save them for special occasions. I visit Erudin a lot and
always pick up a Barnacle Breastplate. (I guess that makes me a
farmer. Funny thing is that the only person I've ever seen hunting
the required mob was another bard. *heh*) When I'm in another town
and see a low-level bard running around in cloth or leather,
I drop the breastplate on them. They get a minor upgrade and they
get to be the center of attention for awhile as everyone
nearby oohs and ahhs about the look. ;-)
