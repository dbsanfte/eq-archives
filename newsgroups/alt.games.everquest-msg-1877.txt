The guards there are set to attack good races but seem to have a limited aggro
radiu. My half elf ranger just ran past them,  running straight for the centre
of the gap between them and avoided triggering them.

I also had SOW on me, and that may have helped, when you get past the guards
keep moving and avoid the npc necro to your left who is used for a newbie quest
in that zone, he also aggro's on good races.
