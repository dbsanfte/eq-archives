That's where I think the problem is with the item I'm
concerned with. I can sell it for the price I sell it
for because I'm well above the trivials required to
make it and I'm always hovering right around the 5%
failure rate when I make it. When I make 100 of them,
I'm always getting 92 to 95 of them. I don't have
max charisma, but I have high enough that I'm pretty
darn close to getting the ingredients at the cheapest
they can be gotten and I have the geerloks for the
skills required. I think that others that are doing
it are having higher costs to make them so they can't
quite understand why I'm not.
