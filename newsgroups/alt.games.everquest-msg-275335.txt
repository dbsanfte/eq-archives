> >I just think of you as spineless and simpering - a pussy in other words.

Heya... its the OP (i was banned for 72 hours for saying PUSSY)...
check previous threads for info & quotes....

...'WoW' im disappointed with the responses ive seen in this NG, i
dont have time to respond to the hundreds of cross-threads its
generated and people reposting this on websites, BUT AGAIN, I state
that this isnt about the definition of p*ssy. This isnt about their
user agreement which I supposedly "violated" (I disagree). This isnt
about me whining. Just the facts.

This is about David doing what he can to make people aware of Goliath
and his methods. Take it or leave it - just dont be a pussy (aka
coward/kissass) and kiss blizzard ass.

***********
When you are banned for 72 hours WITHOUT WARNING for asking your buddy
"Hows it hanging?" or "did you see Meet the Fokkers?" or "hide in that
bush!" or "that guy is a dick!" You will change your tune from
'flaming troll thats bored at work' to WTF!?
************

As for the leet speak 'arguement' and me 'circumventing' their 
rules.. OMG thats not the point, and you clearly play on a carebear
server or are new to the game.... it doesnt matter if it was in leet
speak or general speak.... Leet speak is a part of the PVP servers, it
is spoken constantly, particularily at high levels. It is acknowledged
& accepted as part of the game - OR THEY WOULD HAVE REMOVED IT. If I
/yell b*sh is it somehow different then if I /yell |3 |_| $ |-| ......
!?!! Meanwhile there are people CONSTANTLY swearing on /1 general.....
there are NPC's named "Biznatch"... there are people on the official
wow forums with signatures such as:

G*
F**k
Y***rself
(would you like to buy a vowel?)

THE POINT IS WTF do you need Blizzard wasting resources on censoring
YOU more then any other mmorpg, aspecially when their more laggy &
unstable then any current mmorpg! You want to be censored & protected
to the point where its just anal and ridiculous?  How the hell can you
"pussies" agree with this? Are you french!?!? (sorry hehe)...  Are you
completely spineless? Or are you letting your 10 year old kid play
unsupervised!? Your ignorant if you think this BS will protect your
kid. They will see 10x worse on tv, and 100000x worse internet. Grow
some parenting skills. And most likely your account will be banned
when your kid says something stupid, while not even realizing what
they've done....

The issue here is censorship, not the definition of pussy, not the
user agreement that we were all forced to agree to.

ATTN "Pussies": You dont need this much censorship, wake up. The
profanity filter is enough. TV is far more graphic then WoW.

....How far should Blizzard go to protect your virgin ears? 














Trolls: grow some balls.
