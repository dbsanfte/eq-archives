If you check CNN you'll find there has been a little
"incident" on the east coast that could be responsible
for some of the problem. I'm in the mid-Atlantic area
with access to 3 ISP's and while things have been better
than I expected I've had to add a few lines to my hosts
file to work around DNS trouble.
