The problem is that an awful lot of non-tanks have been able to
ride on the coattails of heavily twinked tanks since the day they
dinged 55.  They haven't learned to play their characters worth a
damn, haven't had to work to gear up, haven't really had to do a
damned thing to make themselves effective in any situation that
is not totally controlled.

My main, Kaev is a L59 Paladin with 3.1khp and 1250ac unbuffed.
Not too long ago I was warned by a Warrior that I needed 6khp
unbuffed to tank in PoV because the mobs hit for 400-ish.  Now,
I've tanked a few 450 hitters in PoStorms at L56 with only Aego
and baby Brell's (no shaman buffs) so I blew off the warning.
Turns out that for pickup groups the guy who warned me was roght
on the money.  These DPS and support class weenies who've been
raving about how awesome the XP has been in PoV since they made
55 are incompetent boobs (or maybe just ignorant twits).  They
are clueless about how to deal with an add unless there's an
Enchanter to mezz, or their Cleric is skilled and geared well
enough to kite the add while still healing the tank, or their
tank is WAY over-geared to the point where he can survive with
little or no healing until the first mob is dead.  It is truly
pathetic.

With that as their "training" experience is it any wonder that
they have no idea how to function without a tank geared and AA'd
way the fuck beyond any of them?

I'm on the verge of completely abandoning Kaev.  The pickup player
pool is (mostly) incompetent in any content beyond LDoN easy mode
(where I can tank 3 mobs at once with a slower or healer who isn't
completely brain-dead), and it's gotten very hard to put together
LDoN groups lately.  All these DPS weenies want to do is level as
fast as they can, their gear is so crappy that the junk that drops
in GE will usually upgrade at least one group member, stuff from
LDoN normals is often an (allegedly) huge upgrade (go-go L59s with
+2 AGI earrings!).  I could possibly improve my gear through LDoN,
but as I said groups are scarce now.  I could, of course, upgrade
overnight to meet the stupid and unreasonable expectations people
have, except that I will NOT buy pp for RL $$.

I've mostly been playing an untwinked lowbie alt on Morden Rasp
lately, but I suppose he'll eventually run into exactly the same
shit since he's a Warrior.  The combination of mudflation so
grotesque that gear differentials for tanks easily matter as much
as 5+ levels, and a combat model where gear, knowledge, and skill
requirements for successful support/DPS class play are thoroughly
minimized by an over-geared tank in 90%+ of content, has really
fucked the game from the perspective of a pickup-grouping tank at
every level of play I've seen.
