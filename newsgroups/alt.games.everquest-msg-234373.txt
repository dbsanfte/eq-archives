 Pets are a very different set of mechanics than pc groups as far as
aggro is concerned. Many of the rules simply don't apply... or apply

Aggro Kiting is an outdoor, wide open spaces tactic...and not
applicable to most of the interesting game play that opens up if you
are in a group. If you want to aggro kite, don't bother grouping :)
