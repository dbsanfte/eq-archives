I would have to disagree on one thing. I have bought Giant Field Rat
Whiskers in qeynos. I did and I tried to sell it and everyone laughed saying
is was a no drop. It is a no drop but the one I bought wasnt and it worked
to make my piece of armour.
Make sure you get Giant FIELD Rat whiskers not giant rat. There is a
difference, I killed a giant field rat and looted a giant rat whiskers and
it didnt work. Must say giant field rat whisker.
