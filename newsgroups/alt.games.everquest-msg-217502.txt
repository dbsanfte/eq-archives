Hey there,

Noticed a little bug in the last two LDoN missions I was on with
regards to the timer.  Mine has been consistently 3-4 minutes slower
than the rest of the groups.  

This normally isn't that much of an issue (Success or failure is
generally assured well before the 90 minutes is up) so I'm not too
worried, but I'm curious if anyone else has the noticed the same?

I don't think lag is an issue; I do zone in slower than the rest of
the party due to my craptacular system, but that should NOT make a
difference.  Any thoughts?
