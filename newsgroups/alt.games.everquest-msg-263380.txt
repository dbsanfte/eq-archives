   First off I would like to say at the start, Thanks Bob for posting your
review of EQII and starting this thread.  Since you seem to have alot of
experience with the various MMORPG's out there, you thoughts on the subject
carry alot of weight to me.

   So no bathroom breaks and woodelves throwing tantrums if they don't get
enough time sitting on the couch watching tv?  This is good to know. 
Though I have to admit the inability to wall up misbehaving characters and
let them starve to death will be something of a drawback, it is not a game
breaker for me.

   This is cause for concern, for I have always considered myself a casual
player.  In EQ  (and currently in CoH) I always tended to level fairly
slowly, owing in part to rampant altitis.  But also is the fact that I
simply, well, don't care too much how long it takes me to reach the high
level game, if indeed I ever do.  I certainly will never enjoy any game
ever again that forces me to camp a particular mob for twenty two freaking
hours if I want to start the process of getting an item that considered
almost mandatory for a high level character to have (I speak of course of
my bitterness of my attempts to get the cleric's epic, which brought to the
forefront my feelings of frustration with EQ).

   Ok, here I have to ask, what does the word "Casual player" mean to you?

  I can't, and won't, play for forty hours a week or more, or spend hours
attending a raid where I am pretty much acting as a robot casting the same
spells the same way over and over again.  But, when I do play, I don't
might having to take an active role.  Heck, I prefer it.  Complicated
crafting that actually engages my mind?  Bring it on, as long as gathering
the materials and whatnot doesn't start to feel like a second job.  And
your description of how healing works in EQII sounds right up my alley as
well.  The groups I disliked the most in EQLive, barring the ones that
contained the random occasional jerk, are ones where things were going so
smoothly that all I had to do was cast the occasional Complete Heal to make
everyone happy (note, in groups like this I would always do more, such as
stunning, nuking, making myself more useful in general).  Groups I loved
the most?  The ones where I was in charge of healing and crowd control,
leading adds away from the MA and parking them with root, then running back
and healing, stunning as I could, in general working my butt off to keep
the party alive.  

To my mind, casual play =/= non engaged play

   Different people enjoy different things, of course.  And until I try
EQII for myself, I have no idea as to whether I will like this system or
hate it myself.  But from your description, it sounds very appealing.

   Here's what hardcore mean to me in reference to EQ (and other MMORPGs, I
suppose).  Having to join a guild and spend long hours chewing through
content in order to get good enough gear to chew through higher content to
get better gear.  Other aspects of this would be having to group to get any
items of worth or experience at a rate that seems reasonable (if I solo, I
expect to get less experience than if I group, but it shouldn't take forty
times longer to progress).

   So, I'm hardly a hardcore player by my view of the term, but by yours
perhaps I am.

   Other questions about EQII, if you don't mind:

Does it have player creatable chat channels (and does it seem it will have
serverwide chat channels)?

Does it have an in game mapping system that shows one's position on the
map?

Does it have an in game email system?

Is it very difficult to learn the crafting system from in game information?

Does one have an inventory system like EQLive?  Is it hard to get to a
vendor to sell if you are out in the wild?  Is there a system in place to
facilitate sales to others players?

Have griefers found a way yet to PK unwilling players?


I appreciate any insights you might choose to share.
