Question...

Ive just returned to EQ from a 7 month break.
Have a 51 shaman.

Can someone give me the skinny on PoP and LoY?
What big changes happened?
Where is a good place to hunt, get groups, etc?
I am bound in the PoK...managed to find that....but, where are the access
points to the other planes?  What level range are they?
This map thing....is there a guide somewhere on how to use it?

Any info on the new zones, new stuff in general, would be very helpful....
Thanks in advance....

Storm
