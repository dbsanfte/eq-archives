Run3 is a godsend.....I thank Quellious each and every day that Ive
got it trained to its max as I can now stay ahead of drolvargs in DL
for the most part.

my agi sux tho, but if I were to get that up to over 100 like the rest
of my stats....I'd be motoring!!!

and dont let any1 kid ya; agi is important.  my 56 bard was almost
left behind by a 61 ranga(we were grp'd and both using my Selo's) who
had an agi of over 120 or so: my bard's agi is around 85+ or so.  and
in the past, all of the other ppl who Ive found leaving *ME* in the
distance have usually had higher agi......or were using SoC and I
wasnt using drums.

*heh!*
