It isn't that I 'have' to play it, I 'want' to play it.
If Verant cant use some organisations skills to plan the patches 
properly that is not my fucking problem.
There is no reason whatsoever they cant make this less hassle for people
Like why do they have 1 server that deals with the logins for the every 
Everquest server? That is just fucked up and very bad design.
As for Shadowbane, if it addresses all the problems Everquest has then 
Verant will be worried as they could easily lose a lot of players.
No one owes Verant anything, I'm gaming the next big game comes along 
and people play it and give up on old ones. That was my point about 
Shadowbane
I suggest you think about these issues before talking any more bollocks 
and telling people to live with it.
