Unimportant to you.  I believe bizbee and I have already said it's 
of moderate importance to us.  It's good to know that our feelings on the 
matter are unimportant to you.

And true, it did previously (and still occasionally) have a much more 
high-spirited meaning.  I recall hearing that argument (that homosexuals 
shouldn't be corrupting such a fine word with their alternate meaning) 
back in the 70's.  Strangely enough, also in San Jose.

>>And the deal here is, that it's being used in a negative way. "Don't

How odd.  You argue nobody is annoyed by these phrases, and yet go to the 
effort to substitute asterisks for key letters in one of them.  That 
suggests to me that you're fully aware -someone- is probably annoyed.  And 
somehow you think self-censorship makes it All Better.  Very, very odd.

For the record, those phrases do annoy me less.  Although the second 
annoys me more than the first.  And there is a nagging feeling that 
suggesting that our body parts are in some way 'bad' is not such a good 
idea.

Perhaps he felt the curtain's high spirits would clash unfavorably with 
the room's otherwise sedate decor. :)

And if so, congratulations.  You have found a lone example of a gay couple 
who are not offended by the usage.  Do you imagine that they speak for all 
gay people?  If you look around, you can probably even find a gay couple 
who support the assorted amendments and measures defining marriage as 
between a man and a woman.  But they, again, hardly constitute majority.

Dan Savage can use whatever word he wants, however he wants, though, in my 
opinion. :)
