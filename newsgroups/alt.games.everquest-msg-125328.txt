What question? Didn't I say it wasn't possible? Yes, I did. I admit,
it's possible I could have been under-informed, but I haven't seen any
proof of that as of yet. And I already admitted in the initial
discussion that it may be possible, just not something that is
"standard information" given to guides.

Seriously, I didn't bother answering because it seemed a rhetorical
question. Everyone knows I said it. Only reason to answer it is to
shut you the fuck up on this dig for attention.

I keep coming back to this because I have some stubborn beleif that if
I beat you over the head with "a clue" often enough, you might get
over yourself. Hasn't happened yet...
