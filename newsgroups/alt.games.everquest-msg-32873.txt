 Wusoshi doesn't root that much from what I've seen. Regardless, Bards
have MR songs which should be more than enough. A bard kiting around
Wusohi is normally how we start things off. Get groups ready and buffed
elsewhere. Bard gets a port to WL and bard leads Wusohi away. The other
3-4 groups (or however many you have) now port to WL and then the bard
comes back with Wuoshi.  I don't think any of our bards have died yet.

 Summoning is "easier" I guess. Whatever way works. I was just offering
an alternative.
