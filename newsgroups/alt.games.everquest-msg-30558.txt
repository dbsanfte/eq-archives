  EQ does make for some odd scenarios, no?  We're happily married 
in RL, happily married in EQ (in spirit, since he isn't "old" 
enough) and here I am contemplating making him into a bigamist.
Your answer was appreciated.  Tealeef took the name last night,
no problems.  This is a relief to me.  I do want to have an in-
game wedding but not a half dozen of them.

    Sounds good.  Off the the NFP market with me, to /auction looking
for a baker to cater a wedding, must bring cake!  Also need Barbarian
and Troll cookies.

     This is going to be the hardest part, and I'm not sure that
we can pull it off.  Neither of us have a high level char to twink
us with appropiate wedding clothes.  Well, twink me.  Really, its 
very possible to dress up a troll.

     Yes and no.  The _main_ market place on Drinal is in NFP.  A
lesser, but still substantial, amount of auctioning goes on in the 
Ecommons side.  Ok, I haven't given alot of thought to the location
yet.  It needs to be somewhere close to a starting city, since a 
friend of mine from another server is going to create a level 1 alt
to attend, and a place that both Good and Evil can meet.

> Oh, and yes, I would like to come if at all possible :)

    I would like that.  I will post a Wedding Invitation post to the
group when I get the when and where's figured out.  It will be a 
while, the groom is still 18. 

Annie  <--- Thinks it would be fun if alot of people from this 
            created wedding mules to attend the event.
