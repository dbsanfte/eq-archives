Either, if your newsreader is indeed set to ignore
already-read posts.

They probably wouldn't "disappear" until after you had left the
newsgroup and returned (again, presuming that's what your problem is).

But if you do still see any already-read posts after leaving the
newsgroup and then returning, then that's probably not your
problem after all.

You may just subscribe to a news server that has to continually
dump "old" messages to keep their hard disks from overflowing.
Actually, *all* news servers do this, but some have enough
space to keep the most recent week's posts, while others
(perhaps yours) may have to dump things after they're only
one day old, or whatever.

Yes, if that's what the problem is (although again, it may not
vanish until you then leave the newsgroup and return).
