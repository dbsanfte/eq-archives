I play a cleric and yes i always med, however this gives u a good
opportunity to sit back and chat to the group. A loose group that fight and
talk about all kinds of stuff, is a lot more fun than the silent one. You
dont have to hit that hotkey for Kick or BS all the time, so what you should
do is add a little flavor to the group with a few comments and soon you will
all have a great time.
