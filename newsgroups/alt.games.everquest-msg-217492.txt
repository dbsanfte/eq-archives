Proc and clicky effects (and traps) have been added with "classes"
set to none for a while now.  Those two are spells that are in the
database but not "in the game".  That is, there is no item with
either of those spells on it ("no item" includes spell scrolls).
Both would fill holes in the Druid spell lineup for low/mid levels
(Circle of Cooling is L29 group FR, Frost Zephyr is L44 AC/CR debuff)
but their potential existence hasn't produced nearly as much angst
on Druid boards I've read as the extended tease of Illusion: Scaled
Wolf seemed to with Enchanters.
