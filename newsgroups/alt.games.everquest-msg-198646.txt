Maybe, maybe not. The situation here was that the person in question 
spent three weeks trying to help get others flagged. No, I wouldn't block 
out that much time at once. I would certainly block out time though. If 
it merely took me three weeks to get *myself* flagged, then I suppose I 
would do that if necessary. I might be inclined to go elsewhere for xp 
and equipment upgrades first, however. No sense jumping into it if there 
is an opportunity to first improve my chances.

*sigh* Yes it is. It is *exactly* the point I mentioned that you rebuked 
and I then came back to support. Please keep up. I've seen a lot of 
circular arguments here for every point of issue I've mentioned. Every 
time I bring up why I think a guild should be willing to pass the trials, 
someone says it takes too long. Every time I point out why I feel it 
shouldn't take so long, someone says it's because of inadequately geared 
guilds. Everytime I point out that if some people in the guild can get 
flagged they can help others, someone says they're not willing to do so, 
which brings me back to my original point of why I believe they *should* 
be willing to do so.

Your guild is your EQ (and occasionally RL) circle of friends. The 
qualities such as loyalty and commitment should be inherent in that. 
These are the qualities that, if truly present, should get people flagged 
that both want to be and are qualified.

On a side note, people wonder why we don't have the respect of SoE the 
way they're always "bending us over", as lamented in many other threads? 
It's because far too many of us refuse to even try to handle a curveball. 
Nevermind. I digress.
