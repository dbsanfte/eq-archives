from KOS to allied takes 3400 gnoll according to some posts on
allakhazam.com. And remember you don't have to kill the gnolls to get the
faction. If you are uber in the zone, hit them once or twice and bring them
to some lowlvl figures. you won't get adds so you can solopull the
commander(s) you make their life easier and you still get the faction. For
casters consider casting DS on noobs. It will give faction as well and you
don't kill their exp.

If you are too much meleebased and there is hardly a soul in blackb, Or only
very lowbies like lvl 5 who barely can stay alive at the sfg-zone, arrange a
high lvl caster like a dru with earthquake. Warn everyone and pull a huge
train from within. Use a spell like eartquake and almost every mob dies.
Finish the remaining ones and call for the noobs to get back and let them
loot. So they can have the armor and other stuff. Or can walk away totally
encumbered but getting some big money for their lvl.

Holly is jaggedpine (wich also improves) by killing gnolls.
And whatever you do, don't kill scout matilyn. He's weak but gives you huge
factionhits you'd better zone to reset agro if needed.
