My thoughts are that anyone who's so battered mentally that they have to
resort to posting the same thing over and over again is nothing more than
either an idiot or a child.  I'm not endorsing Zeppo, by any stretch of the
imagination.  I'm simply pointing out the fact that DT was so vengeful, that
he/she/it felt the need to contact Zeppo's ISP and whine like a 4-year old
with a skinned knee.  DT even went so far as to admit that he/she/it <could>
have just KF'd Zeppo, but would "rather see him getting smacked down for
abuse of TOS."  Rather than be a man/woman/adult <thing>, DT turned bitch
and squealed.  Once again, the line between the virtual world and real world
was crossed, with negative results.  Now that my position has been
explained, justify it.  If you can.

"Unwritten rules"?

If there is no direct reference to "rules", per se, who's to say who is
responsible for enforcing these "phantom laws"?

I'll quote it again, just for you (the selective reader):

Heheh. Mr Bishop comes through for us again.:
(Obvious gloating)

*Ramble, ramble, whine, whine* substituted.

Then:

Yes, I can just killfile him, but I'd rather see him getting smacked down
>for abuse of TOS.
(Vengance is mine, sayeth the tattletale)

Below is pasted just one of his posts. The rest are
>replies to various posts of mine, all the same except the quoted message.:
(More "I'm telling mom" mentality)

References posted, quotes documented and my thoughts and opinions evident, I
ask you again...  Your thoughts on Matt Frisch?  Is it any different from
Zeppo, or are the "unwritten rules" flexible, so as to exclude Matt Frisch
from the perceived "norm"?
