That can be true on raids, but not in a typical single group hunt.

Necros are the kings of versatility, they are the only class that can
crowd control, heal, do damage, pull (with fd and harmshield), recover
from a wipeout (with summon corpse and the 800pp res) and (through their
pet) even tank a bit. A perfect group may not need a necro, but most of
the other 13**5 class combinations are vastly improved by adding one.

A necro should be doing whatever the group is lacking, covering for
anyone who is afk/ld, and yes, feeding mana to anyone who is low mana.

It can be a problem for necros that doing this involves understanding
the way the group is working, figuring out what the weakest link is and
reinforcing it. If you don't group much, it is easy to get wrong. Few
other classes have as many decisions to make (cleric joins group. Asks
'you want me to heal'? Group says 'doh').
