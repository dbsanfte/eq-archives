AE groups don't generally use mez. That monk staff would be perfect
for an AE group.

Despite common misperception, you DO NOT have to use mez for EVERY

They also get better resist tables than other casters, and some spells
that are practically unresistable (lures), and they get ludicrously
powerful AE spells.
