Unfortunately i'm on Povar :) Anyway I bit the bullet and have ordered
POP and the (old) Gold expansions, so hopefully I can get to the
bazaar soon  and buy some stuff :)

I wonder if these two expansion comes with any gametime ? I went and
bought another copy of the magazine that I got the EQ disk from hoping
I could enter the code and get another month but it seems the code
only works for creating a new account :(
