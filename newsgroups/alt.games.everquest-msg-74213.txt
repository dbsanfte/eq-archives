Ok, I'm a bit confused on this one.  By level 5, I'm finally earning enough
money to keep myself fed.  Orc Pawns just don't carry that much loot.  How

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
