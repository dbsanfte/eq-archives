I was curious about a couple other things in EQ2:

Do the same racial traits from EQ1 races carry over to those races in
EQ2?  (e.g., EQ2 Ogres having frontal stun immunity like EQ1 Ogres)?

I know each EQ2 class starts out as a certain archetype (fighter,
mage, priest, scout) and (correct me if I'm wrong) when you reach a
certain level you can then choose the a more specific profession in
that archetype (warrior/brawler/crusader for the "fighter" archetype,
etc.).  Do the classes in EQ2 inherit any class-specific abilities
from the EQ1 classes? (i.e., both EQ1 and EQ2 SKs have Harm Touch)?

What about the "artisans"?  Is that like a whole separate entity from
the combat archetypes? (i.e., you can choose to be an artisan instead
of a fighter, mage, priest or scout)?  Or do you still have to choose
a combat class but can also be an artisan and learn a trade?  Also, is
it true that one can level up just by doing tradeskills and not doing
combat?  

(I've also heard that, at least in beta, people who were working on a
tradeskill like smithing would sometimes have the forge explode on
them and get killed, so it sounds like artisanship can be just as
dangerous as combat!)

Thanks in advance!
