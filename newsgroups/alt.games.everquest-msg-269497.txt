You say you heard but I think you missed the point completely. The
reward in this case is not material, it is in the form of 'having
fun', or 'being addicted' maybe would be better. People are many times
happier with a rusty sword they feel they earned because of a direct
threat against them getting it than ten swords of elite uberness that
they feel was handed to them.

It's the secret to mmorpg addictiveness. Make them work harder, and
they'll become more addicted (assuming they want to keep playing,
accomplished through other means) right up until they hit the wall...
then comes the hatred.
