There is an xp bonus that has been applied to a number of severely
underpopulated zones in an effort to get people to go there.

Just being "in a dungeon" is a gaurantee of higher xp from the perspective
that you don't need to go hunting around for targets, since they spawn in
reliably known locations with predictable timers.

Verant published a list of which zones got what kind of an upgrade, but in
a quick&dirty search I wasn't able to locate any news site that has an
easily locatable copy of it.
