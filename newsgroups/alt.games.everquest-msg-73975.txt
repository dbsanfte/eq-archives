If you do the barb beastlord quests, one of the first items you get is a helm
with the appearance of a polar bear head.

Dunno about Wu's, I have heard it is beastlord usuable, but not whether
it is also Barb usuable.  Don't own any (nor do I intend to unless they
put the weight limitation in, as some have suggested they will)
