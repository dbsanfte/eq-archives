Is that how it's going to work?  I haven't read much about it.  I got the
impression that it will allow you to become an NPC vendor...that you don't
even need to be logged in at all.

But yeah, that zone is seriously bad when it comes to system resources...I
can't think of one that's worse.  I wonder if Verant could cut back on a LOT
of bells & whistles in that zone...make it plain, boring, ugly, anything at
all...to make it easier to zone in from Nexus and NOT have your computer
have a cow when you turn that corner next to the bank.
