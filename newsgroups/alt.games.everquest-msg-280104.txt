/agree

I've duoed an SK Cleric at many levels of the game, but they were built 
for a trio with an enchanter. If I were to do it just as a duo I'd go 
with a SHM SK to pick up slow/haste and dots.

Rezzes before 30 aren't worth the downtime waiting to get your mana 
back, unless only the SK dies, and he was bound a long way away and the 
cleric is by the body.

Clr Rng is pretty good.

While that's noble, if you know your going to be a duo, you'll have more 
fun if you can go more places and do more stuff. A good duo can do a lot 
mroe than a poor duo. A -lot- more.

My vote for best duo involving a fighter class would be SK + SHM. Hands 
down unstoppable. The only thing they lack is a solid stun. And that's 
not critical for most mobs, and at low levels you can fear-snare-nuke 
healers.

If a fighter isn't required, there are several excellent caster duos... 
a pair of necros is very powerful. Or a necro enchanter. 

Or a charming enchanter coupled with a shaman or druid or cleric.

If you want both want to play fighters, then Beastlord+ Pali, Ranger, 
Beastlord, SK, or Monk

would all be not bad. (Bsts are the only melee slower so they're 
indispensible really in a pure melee duo, longer term) They also heal 
and have substantial dps, as well as bring some mana regen later on too.

A 2nd beastlord is just more beastlord goodness, but lack of other 
abilities hurts a bit. A pali rounds out the healing adequately, and 
adds multipurpose stuns (poor man snare, and spell interuption). A 
ranger adds some ghetto healing, snare, solid dps, and track is always 
nice to have. A monk gives you some good pulling tools, solid dps, and 
mend actually is a pretty damn viable heal in a pinch. An SK has some 
leech abilities eventually that are relevant as a fighter duo, as well 
as snare, pulling, and fear.

I'd also recommend trolls and iksars where available for any duo 
especially for a double fighter one, or any duo without a "real" healer 
the double regen is markedly nice especially at the lower levels where 
you aren't loaded up with long term buffs and +regen equipment, and if 
you aren't concerned about levelling the xp hit is pretty irrelevant.

Also I'd think more about the 30-55 game than the 1-30 game. Unless you 
go out of your way not to lvel you'll be in your mid 20s VERY quickly 
the EQ's low game is now.
