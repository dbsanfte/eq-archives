Yup...meaning that if person X buys a 2.0 GHz and a GeForce2 MX 400,
and person Y buys a 1.7 GHz and a GeForce3 Ti 500, person Y will have
a noticably faster gaming system for about the same price.

Speaking of video cards, www.visiontek.com has a nifty thing...go to
the page for any of their video cards and click the "Analyze My Card!"
link.  It downloads a thing that figures out what card you have, and
shows some graphs showing how the various cards they sell should
compare to yours.  Handy for figuring out of upgrading is worthwhile.
