Last night in High Keep, my 25 Rogue joined a
Guard room group that had a Cleric.  Or an
alleged Cleric, anyway.

The first time I died, shortly after joining
the group, I figured the Cleric had just been OOM,
no big deal.  The group leader apologized, but
I said, "no problem, it happens", and looted 
my corpse and got back into the action.

But it gets worse.

A while later, I died again.  Without having
received a single heal, (despite my saying "Heal??"
while my health was dropping like a rock), nor even
an "oom" warning to let us know we should run to
the guards if we start getting beat on too heavily.

If I hadn't zone-crashed during the death, I was
going to /gsay "I'm sorry, my fault, I thought
we had a Cleric", but by the time I logged back
in, the moment had passed.

But it gets worse.

One time the Cleric said simply "brb" and left
the room.  Ok, maybe he was running to the bank
upstairs to unload, we'd all been doing that
from time to time, albeit with a bit more
explanation and with an "is now a good time?"
question.  No, 30 seconds later the group
status showed that the Cleric had ZONED OUT
of High Keep.   Oookay.  "Where are you?"
we asked.  "Brb", was the only reply.  He eventually
returned from his mysterious and time-consuming
errand without any further explanation.

But it gets worse.

We often ran into trouble when runners aggroed
other Goblins that we were not yet ready for, or
ran upstairs only to be KS'ed by the guards.  So
several times, over about an hour, the group
leader asked, "can anyone Root or Snare?"  He
never got any positive response.  So finally,
after about the fourth time the question was
asked, I /gsay'ed pointedly, "At what level
do Clerics get Root?"  The alleged Cleric
responded, "Clerics get Root at level 9", but
he didn't take the hint, and never Rooted
any Goblins.

But it gets worse.

Here's the worst part:  This was one of those
Clerics who always seemed to be OOM, despite
sitting on his butt continually and never
seeming to actually heal anyone when they
needed it.  So where was his mana going?
I started watching carefully for any spellcasting
from him, and finally noticed that at least
half the time, HE WAS CASTING HEALS ON PEOPLE
WHO WERE ALREADY AT FULL HEALTH!  No, we did
not have another healer who had just beat him
to the same healing target.  No, he wasn't
chain-healing the main tank as he got beat on.
He'd often do this during downtime, between
fights, apparently just randomly casting heals
on people who were already at full health.

I thought to myself, I *must* be mistaken, or
maybe he had just mistargeted once or twice and
I caught him at a bad time.  But as I watched
over the next ten minutes or so, I watched him
do it again and again and again.  I finally
did a /gsay, "Um, is there any special reason
you're casting heals on people who are already
at full health?"  No response -- nor did it
break him of the habit...

Unbelievable, but unfortunately true.

So why didn't we kick him from the group?  Frankly,
because we were doing well enough even without his
questionable "help", and because he was a great
source of "you gotta be kidding me" entertainment.
But I wasn't sorry to see him eventually go, the
Druid that replaced him was a far better healer
than the Cleric ever was.
