I don't think he was suggesting that that was how it does work, but rather
offering an illustration of how it is feasible in a game to make it
individualized sufficiently narrowly that what works for one person doesn't
work for thousands of others.

However, just for the sake of argument, they *could* make it so a skill
combination can be figured out.  For example, they could make it so you have
a hidden bonus in the skills that will make you a Jedi.  When you notice all
the other newbies complaining that they can never hit anything with their
Blaster skill of, say, 10, and you haven't bothered to raise your Blaster
skill past 1 because you are hitting things with ease, you might guess that
it is some latent Jedi affinity you have for Blasters showing through, and
so training in Blasters might be a good thing.

Hmmm....how is that going to fit in with the bond/bounty system for PC-run
quests?  If I give a nuetral person a job, and they rip me off, how can I
send bounty hunters after them if they can't be PK'ed?
