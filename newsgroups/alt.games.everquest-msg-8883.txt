Though I realize that zero cast time is great, what's the big deal?  How
many of us *don't* have 1.5 seconds (t-boots) during downtime?  If someone
with t-boots couldn't spare 1.5 seconds every once in a while....

One thing I'll confess to ignorance:  with jboots, can you renew the spell
effect *before it's normal end* just like you can with sow?
