You can use training points in languages for rp reasons, in tradeskills up
to 21 i think (but its a bad idea : tradeskills are very easy to raise from
0 to 21) or in others skills like combat or magic.

For some classes, training points may be a very nice boost : for example
rogue (backstab) or int casters (for research, when research was the only
way to obtain some spells).

But for a paladin, i think there is no skill which is difficult to raise.
Anyway, my advice would be to use your training points to boost some of your
skills which are behind the others. i.e. bash like you said.

Training points you dont spend are useless. I think its stupid to reach
level 50 with 200 training points left. The exception would be for weapon
skills you didnt use at all : i.e. you reach level 50 with 0 in 2HB and you
find a good 2HB. But IMO, you shouldnt reach level 50 with 0 in a weapon
skill if you are a melee class ;-)
