Depending on your race youll have quite a few options.

I have an Iksar Necro, and took him to Shadeweavers Thicket / Paludal
Caverns on Luclin. At starters I was indifferent to the Vah Shir,
moved up to amiable, so binding, shopping and banking in Shar Vahl is
possible.

In the Paludal tunnels on the Shadeweaver Thicket side, theres a lot
of Sensate Reishi, which are non-social. Mix with Mudburrowers to
taste, but beware - these are social, and will help each other. Moving
up to level 16ish, the Plerg Phlargs become an option - these use a
spreading crud disease spell, so youll have to be able to deal with
that.

From 13 to 20 are easily doable in the Paludal, solo. The caverns can
sustain your levelling until, I guess, lvl25-ish. Theres a neat EXP
bonus.

Only problem can be the spamming of OOC and Shout - but its a big
place, and youll be able to stay away from others. A dangerous place
as well - some will from time to time need the services of a locate /
drag corpse.

Moving on - Netherbian Lair and Echo Caverns are an option after the
Paludals.

Other good places are Kurn's tower in the Field of Bone on Kunark. A
lot of undead there, youll be heavilly loaded with bonechips when you
leave that place. Your evokation skill will be usefull there for the
ward undead line of spells. Acceptable loot too, only problem is that
being a non-iksar, youll have to do a lot of faction work to be able
to bind, shop and bank.

Kurn's tower can be done from lvl10-ish (depending), to approx. lvl
22/23.

Other good places can be Blackburrow, which can earn you good faction
with Qyenos - should you need that.

Good luck with your Necro
