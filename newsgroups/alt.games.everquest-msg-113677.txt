  I don't know all the details, but the way I understand it is tha the four
warders carry some pretty nice loot.  If you wake the Sleeper, there are no
more warders to kill, thus you permanently ruin everyone else's shot at
killing the warders for their loot.

  I don't think there are any NPCs that talk about the event.  The only
permanent effect that I'm aware of is that the warders don't ever spawn
again.  As for what he does, they pretty much describe it... he wanders a
few zones, killing everyone in sight, then apparently despawns and is never
seen again.

  The most famous one is the battle of Kithicor, in which Lanys T'Vyl
(Innoruuk's daughter) and Firiona Vie (Tunare's Chosen) duked it out in
Kithicor forest.  Predictably the good guys one, but someone on the losing
side got really pissed and some of the denizens of the Plane of Hate are
still able to manifest themselves in the zone at night time (or maybe it's
that the soldiers who fell in battle rise again at night, I don't exactly
recall.)
