So, how many times can you have that high level dot resisted before you're
OOM?  Fizzles?  Duration (after all, your main aim is to stop the regen)? 
Resistability?

But I bet you wouldn't use snare and root at higher levels either, since
they're shitty low level spells.  Gate and bind moved to the back of the
book, because they're shitty low level spells.

Only a simpleton doesn't evaluate all tools available for a job on the basis
that "I've had this for a while, it must not be good anymore."  Yeah, I'd
use the higher level dot if the shaman was the main damage dealer...  but... 
umm...  that just generally doesn't happen.
