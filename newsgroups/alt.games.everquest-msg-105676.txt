I know someone who has used ShowEQ in the past (he quit EQ almost a
year ago, so this info is more than a year old). According to him,
when you are in a zone all of the mob/NPC/PCs are listed and show up
on a map display. Even mobs that are invisible and do not show up with
the tracking skill. (he didn't say whether or not invis-GMs are
shown).

So theorectically a GM could spawn an invis untrackable mob, and if a
player ran over to the exact spot it was standing or chased it around
the zone, the GM would know they were using ShowEQ. It would be really
funny to see some idiot running around South Ro looking for a fake AC
that only shows up if you are a GM or running ShowEQ heheheh.
