There's an Everquest website?  What's the address?  Anything neat there?
Can I download the game?  What about cheat codes?  Does it tell me how to
play on my 'puter without accessing the net?  Does it tell me how to stop
spamming poll questions?  Can I buy a high level account there because if I
have to play with PvP griefers, I want to be able to take them and not
worry?  Does it tell you where the phat lewt is?
