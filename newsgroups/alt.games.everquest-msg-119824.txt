One question:   if they offer *more* than the going rate is that just
as offensive?   Assuming the normal rate is 20pp, would you as
offended by a 40pp donation as you would by a 2pp donation?

If not, you're not hoping for "good will," you're hoping to con the
sucker paying for the port.   You'd be no different than the person
offering items for sale with "make offer" who won't sell for less than
market value but will happily sell it to you for twice market value.
