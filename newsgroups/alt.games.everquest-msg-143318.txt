How do dragons feel about you?

Wuoshi, when still alive, hangs out right next to the port in spot.  Wuoshi
is on Claws of Veesahn faction, so if you have nonKOS faction with CoV, then
it is fairly safe to port in.  If you are KOS to CoV, then try asking if
anyone knows if Wuoshi is up.  Chances are good that Wuoshi is not, as
Wuoshi gets killed fairly soon after spawning usually.
