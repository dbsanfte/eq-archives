Ill take names that start with those ANYDAY over much of the crap I
see these days. Poopiepants? Scratchinjooup? Biganus? Im sure we've
all seen idiocy like this.

Ok - I had a character named Stormguide (obviously from the email I
use here) - at least its not a reference to a body part (or function)
or a cheap rip off of a known literary character (at least to my
knowledge).
