Shopping in the Bazaar last weekend I decided that Adastraea's chest 
armor needed an upgrade. She was still wearing a Robe of Abrogation,
which had cost 9500pp. Two Robes of Tempest were available for 9750
each. The Regeneration 2 effect on Abrogation wasn't noticable at
level 35. The Improved Damage 3 on the Tempest would be much more
useful.
  Monday, before heading to work, I left Ada in the Bazaar trying to 
sell here Abrogation robe for an even 10k. At work, my friend Kam,
who runs Zkar, Ekho, Monty, Clerissa, and various others, informed
me he would be in Droga that night. I'd camped the King Room with 
him before, when Rabotev was 51; got a yellow bubble of xp there.
I was determined to get another, however long it took - Rab was 55
now, but I had all kinds of time this particular night. And there
was a chance of a Copper hammer of Striking dropping, which
my monk Tosev could use - though I'm starting to prefer 2HB stuff
with him; they seem to give more DPS.
  Then it was a stop. Toward the end of work there was a change of 
plan: another of our co-workers, who runs Adiron, wanted something
in Nadox. Kam knew the Pure Blood quest was on my to-do list.
Others in Lords of Corruption needed things there. Meet in Gunthak.
  I get home, the robe has sold. I quickly turn around and get the 
Tempest. It's an ugly mustard color. the Abrogation was a cool
midnight purple, almost black. Still, for a wizard nothing is more
fashionable than killpower.
  Kam goes LD that night and Rabotev is left puttering around in 
Dulak for a couple of hours filling up his inventory - I've learned to
prefer mobs with visible weapons and shields. Shivs are worthless
but the Bucklers of Innoruuk are 3pp, Boarding Axes 7pp, and most
Zraxthil stuff in that range. One load, plus money from my targets, 
is about 200pp, and I'm slowly but steadily grinding out the xp. 
  The following day the mobs in OT feel the burn - or rather the freeze;
Ada's preferred nuke just now is a cold-based one. 325 damage
routinely, one crit for 550! Few things last long enough to aggro on
her.
  Kam isn't at work that day. That night he proves to have been laid up 
with a 24 hour flu bug. The Nadox group can't get together that night;
I do more grinding in Dulak.
  Wednesday Kam is back in action; Nadox is hopefully a go. That 
night it proves to be so. Yet another co-worker, who runs Pulast and 
Ceam, has been working on a Dwarf pally he hasn't told me about;
he's up to level 49 now, name is Clober. We all gather in Gunthak:
Clerissa, Ekho, Clober, Adiron, along with Luvase, Cickle, and kitty
shaman Flikka Dafleas of LoC. Oops, Kam goes LD again; more 
cable problems. After ten minutes we decide to go without him and 
let him catch up if he comes back.
  I ask if we will succor once we get into Nadox; am told no. I head for
the Initiates' entrance, but everyone else takes the lava river; I must
backtrack. Then, with levitate inoperative in the zone, we all swim
(13 damage every second, partially countered by Regrowth) until we
can walk along the walls (steep slopes, but navigable)...roght to the
succor point! Gah. 
  We set to work. A Broken Skull Clan blood drops fairly soon; I loot it
before being told we are very lucky to have seen it so quickly - it's a 
rare drop. And Luvase needs some too. Oh, well, we can get some more 
later. But tonight we are concentrating on Adherents. We make our way 
into the hall, within sight of the Adherents' spawn points, and pick
them
off for two hours. 
  Everyone who needs a Blackened Vial gets one. No medallions drop.
The adherends never seem to gate when I hit them with two dots, but I
don't have the mana flow to sustain that; often I med and they gate, 
repopping just down the hall where they quickly heal up to 33%, but
we just head in and take them down there. A named keeps popping;
we simply take him down each time, he's little tougher than Adherents, 
and every time he drops some sweet gloves, +4 int, +25 hp, +35 mana.
I get a set for Ada, and a couple blues of xp on the night.
  Before logging I get the gloves to Ada. She was using Gem Inlaid
Gauntlets;
the new gloves aren't in the same uber-class as her robe, but are a nice
upgrade all the same. Rab has two components for Pure Blood; now he
needs to do Luggalds, in the opposite direction in Nadox, but I hear
they can be soloed. 
  Poor Kam! I keep hoping we can get together more, and then one bug or 
another keeps knocking him down. Well, just keep plugging away and it 
will work out eventually...
