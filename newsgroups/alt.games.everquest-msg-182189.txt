That's when it is nice to be a wiz.  They never know what hit them.  The
only thing that really bothers me is they always know which way to run to
get at me.  I've been clobbered by spells and had no idea which direction it
was coming from.  If they didn't know, then they might take a moment getting
their bearings.  That way I could hit them with the nasty stuff, then put a
root on them while they're trying to figure it out.  Instead, I have to
root, then start blasting away when they are ready for it.

Cheers,
Eric
