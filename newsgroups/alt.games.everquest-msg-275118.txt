I think it is virtually impossible to have that many active players even 
given that alot of people 2 box or morebox...

If there was even half the number I wouldnt be logging on and sitting lfg 
for 3 hours after going round checking all the zones where people tend to 
go, ie WoS, MPG, NC, BoT, Solro and so on...

6 months ago I would rarely wait even 5 minutes for at least 2 offers after 
going on lfg tool...now I am quite often only person on there... And when I 
say dead zones I mean no-one in them, nada, zip. Logged on yesterday and 
there was 11 people in PoK including me....

This is on Xev server btw
