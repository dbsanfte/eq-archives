Yeh, up until a patch of a few weeks ago you could have fished in the
abysmal sea.  I knew people that fished the hell out of that zone before the
NPCs were changed to not give you as much PP for your catch.  I knew some
people who made over 12K a day fishing.  Course they had no other life than
EQ when doing this.
