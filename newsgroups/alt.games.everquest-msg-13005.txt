I can tell you, from comments on the EQTraders boards (http://www.eqtraders.com;
more specifically http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_darkelf.htm)
and talk within Rosewhite's guild (Povar-Tarew Artisans on Xev) say that all
culturals except halfling are difficult to make. The smithed armors are
EXCEPTIONALLY difficult to make; they have a horrible "success" rate and require
materials that can be very difficult to obtain.

The Tier'Dal (Dark Elf) chain you mention requires the use of adamantite, which
is quite expensive. If you want to make enchanted armor, you need a 49th level
Enchanter spell. Imbued armor requires the use of a sapphire and a 29th level
cleric spell. All armor (and some weapons) require shadow temper, made with elf
blood (kill elves), neriak nectar (bought off a merchant) and essence of shadows
(kill shadowmen) and trivial at 135 brewing skill.

The chain is based on adamantite rings. Each ring requires a neriak nectar, a
file and a large brick of adamantite. Approximate cost  for the rings is 144pp
*each*.

Tier'Dal veil, neckguard, boots and bracer requires one adamantite ring, 1
shadow temper, a tier'dal smithy hammer (no idea on price), a chain mail pattern
and a silk swatch. Tunics, capes and leggins require *3* adamantite rings. The
only information known about the skill required is that they are trivial above a
202 smithing skill. Enchanted chain mail apparently does NOT trivial (ie, its
trivial is above the 250 skill cap.)

Dark elf plate armor is even worse to make.
