What...the.. FUCK?!?  What in the hell are you talking about here?
Did the above have some sort of hidden meaning to you when you typed
it in?  Did you eat enough lead-based paint chips as a child that the
above paragraph actually has some hidden coherency in it to you?

Yeah, there are a lot of readily apparent things here.  

One, you're a hipocrite.  Twinking is perfectly acceptable as long as
YOU'RE on the recieving end.  Here, I'll give you a Flowing Black Silk
Sash.   What, you're not going to turn it down?  Of course not.
Twink.

Two, your an incoherent, rambling idiot who cannot back up his
arguments.  We're still waiting for that decree on high that states
that twinking is "cheating".

Three, it's looking more and more like you're a common troll.  One
wonders if you were not the first person to start this thread to begin
with.
