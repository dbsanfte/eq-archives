Err, how do you know that NO Drop Items are gone ?
They don't always drop NO DROP.

I would also recomend :

1) Hunting other "Large" spawns as they seem to be on the same table.
When I was hunting Large spiders, if I could not find any I would kill
Large yellow jackets and Rats to encourage spawning

2) Talk to other players /auction or /shout that you are looking for
some NO Drops. (Don't do this too often (SPAM))

3) /Shout the locations of NO DROPS that you don't need (e.g. if you
have killed a spider and it has a NO DROP for a druid) hopefully other
players will return the favour.

As far as I could tell Large things mostly spawn on the Newbie side of
the wall, but some spawn on the hard side of the wall. Giant things are
only on the hard side.

HTH,

Jim
