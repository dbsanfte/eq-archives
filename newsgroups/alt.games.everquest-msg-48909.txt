Yep, 45 defense at level 26 is terrible.  Max that out (to 130 as
Celaeno says) and you'll see a *large* increase to your AC.

How to do it?  Get hit a lot :)  Looks like you've spent most of your
career (successfully) avoiding being hit - which is not a bad thing in
itself, but when the time comes to take some hits from something big,
you're going to suffer.

A couple of ways to do this -

1) Solo some low blue mobs (high teens should be blue at 26 I think),
   meleeing them as much as possible.  Root & back off to heal when
   you're low on health.  That'll raise your 1hb as well, though that's
   less important.

2) Find some dangerous zones which are prone to training.  Wait for
   a train, hit DA & sit down in the middle... yes, this is risky :-)
   Mistmoore & Unrest used to be great for this, not sure what they're
   like these days.
