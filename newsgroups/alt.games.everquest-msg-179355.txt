Well I just loged off.  The gm's where spaming that aslong as you kept
everything inside of the screen you would not have any problems as you zone.
I got a reply to /petition that 1. this isn't something you use /petition
for. And 2 It wasn't broke, it was a feature.

Great feature.  I lost my inventory screen.  Had to load the default UI and
then load my custom ui and get it tweeked like i like it.  Not bad enough
that every 3 or 4 patches they through something in there to cause you to
loose your UI prefrences.

Omiin.

PS  sore for the mail Adam.  should have looked at where it was being sent.
