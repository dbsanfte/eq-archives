Based on what? The fact that they can play EQ more than 10 hours per
week? I'll check the box:
[x] All of the above

Sure, the high level game eats up a lot of your time
Sure, a high proportion of no-lifers reach the high level game

However, it's totally possible to play the endgame whilst holding down a
full time job, relationship, family, and everything else. I'd venture to
say whilst playing the high level game with a full time job, I've also
got an 'above average' social life, and a great relationship with my
girlfriend of almost 10 years. What proportion of this newsgroup could
say the same? Please don't go making ignorant generalisations
