    Add me in to the "added water consumption" group. My first character, a
Shadow Knight, spent a great deal of time in Oasis but never looted meats or
attacked Madmen (Madman make troll crispy, aieee!) Back in Innothule, when
restocking food it was at a 1:1 ratio between rations and water flasks. In
Oasis, the ratio over time was 1:2. When the nearest vendor is all the way
back in Grobb, you tend to notice these things.
