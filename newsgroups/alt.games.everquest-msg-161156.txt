Well, you can ignore my previous post about soloing in Kael. :-) Basically
the giants there resist or break root almost immediately and since they hit
so hard its pretty much impossible for a level 50 cleric to solo them. I
have problems with even the light blues!

So I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions about where I might solo.
I'm finding that in Eastern Wastes I can do the dark blue Frost Giant
Beserkers, Savages (level 37-39) and Ogre Mercenaries (37-38) just fine. But
they're not so great when it comes to loot. Frost Giant Elites are too hard
and Scouts are light blue. Obviously, down time doesn't matter since I spend
the long time on my butt doing my real work!

Any suggestions about other mobs that would be around the same level but
have better loot? A fondness for being rooted is a prerequisite.
