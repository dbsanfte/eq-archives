My Druid's Affliction Efficiency and Extended Affliction items
have given their little messages on DoTs, Snares, & Roots.  He
does not have any debuffs (i.e. resist, ac, etc.) that are not
DoTs so I can't say whether it would work on those, though an
Enchanter (*hint*) could check whether they work for pure
debuffs like tash and long duration 'stun' effects like mez,
not to mention slows.
