> Am I missing something?  Who'd ever want to play a human?

Ooh!  Ooh!  Me!  Me!

I'm a human cleric.  You want to know why I chose a human?  Faction!

When I started EQ, I chose a Dark Elf wizard.  *Everyone* hated me.
Everyone.  I felt very left out and excluded.

So when I started my next character, I chose a human so that most everyone
would like me.  And it worked!  I could go to Freeport and Qeynos and Halaas
and Rivervale and Kelethin and Ak'anon and... the list was seemingly
endless.  Okay, so I couldn't go back to Neriak, but the tradeoff was worth
it.

As I progressed in levels, I did find that not having night vision could
really be a bummer at times, and I had a long way to go to catch up with the
WIS of my HE cleric friends.  But in time I overcame those.  My WIS is
currently maxed for my level, and if I ever find myself without my equipment
in a dark place, I can simply summon a Halo of Light.

I really don't think playing a human made playing my class any more or less
difficult.  And, to be honest, I kinda get a kick out of being against the
norm a bit - you'll find very few Rodcet Nife clerics on the server.  To me,
standing out a little from the crowd is well worth the occasional night
vision problems.  =)
