And in fact most self-respecting necro's will not twitch (that's what
they call mana pumping).  They expect other classes to manage their
own mana just like they do.  Granted they are incredibly effecient at
it but still....

I have a 66 necro and I rarely twitch, and only on my own accord.  If
a person asks for it I say no or ignore them.  If they are over their
head then they should tell the group.  If they can't manage their
mana, how the hell did they get to this level in the first place?!

To be fair I've only had 3 people ever ask for it, 2 were clerics.  On
both counts I said no, then they got pissy.  Once resulted in me
leaving, the other resulted in me getting disbanded.  Whatever.
The third was a guildy who was clueless on his new mana using class so
I did it for a while.  Call me soft....

I have done it on my own accord when it was more beneficial to the
group, but honestly that's a rare thing.  A necro can dish out an
incredible amount of damage over time,  as well as all the things
mentioned above.

So, the short version of all this is, yes, your bad.  Necro's are not
there to provide anyone with mana.  If they do, consider it the
generous boon that it is.  If you ask for it, expect to be insulted
or, at the least, ignored.
