Rubbish, PoP hasn't been in the shops for a week. Noone judges the succes of
a product by one weeks salesvolume.
I bet they haven't even added all the numbers up yet, from the preorders at
sony and the other webretailers to the shipments to major outlets. Half of
the first print still has to be in transit if you ask me.
