You called a GM to get out of VP?  Seriously?  I'm absolutely 
flabbergasted.  We've just always taken it as gospel that the GMs still 
won't help in VP.  If we have people go LD or have to leave, we just have 
an extraction team go in the next day.  Since I've been the solo cause of 
said extraction team once (ToV!=VP), I make it a point to help in any way 
I can, usually in running the actual useful characters around.
