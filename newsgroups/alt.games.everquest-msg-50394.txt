But having only 8 spell slots means that you have to plan ahead on what
spells you will have available based on the situation, rather than just
always having every spell available, this is why it is a balance issue.
Just becuase countless other games don't do it that way does not mean that
it is not the right thing to do in EQ.  I find that it is challenging to
have to always decide which spells I think I will need, and that makes it
more interesting to me.
