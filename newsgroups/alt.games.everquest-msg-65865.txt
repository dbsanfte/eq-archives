A better solution would be to just go back to DirectX 8.0A.  It was
good enough when they pressed the CDs...I seriously doubt that they
are actually doing anything that *requires* DirectX 8.1  (If they
are...then I want to know why the hell new features were added between
gold master and release...the only things that should be in the patch
at release are bug fixes).  Revert to 8.0A, and announce that Win95
support will end in six months, which gives people on Win95 reasonable
time to make arrangements, and don't actually switch to DirectX 8.1 as
a requirement until something actually *needs* it.

There's some evidence that SoL was rushed out...perhaps this is just a
consequence of that?  I don't recall Velious having many problems.
SoL has had more downtime in the last 3 days than DAoC has had total
since its release (heck...I think DAoC would win that comparison even
if the beta 4 downtime were included in the total).
