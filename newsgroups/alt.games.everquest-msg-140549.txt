Wandered into Befallen today to practice my picklock skills and saw a 
couple I've never seen before.  Illia's doesn't have any info on them, 
and a search on Google turned up no hits.  First mob was a skeletal 
excavator - there were a couple hanging around the rocky area just 
inside Befallen, and they spawned around the big rocky area in the main 
area of the first floor.  Being 35, I have no idea what level they are. 
:) They died easy though.  Dropped rusty-level weapons and (always) a 
rusty mining pick.  The other mob, a cracked skeleton, I only saw one of 
- standing, again, in the main area of the first floor, around the rocky 
bit.  That one dropped nothing and also died fast.  Sent pictures and 
the little bit of info I have to Illia.  Anybody ever seen them before?

Ryou
