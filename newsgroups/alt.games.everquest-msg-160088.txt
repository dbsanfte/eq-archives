    Being a paladin is quite simple, on a fundamentals level, and you
actually know most of the tricks. You'll likely be using a two-hander for
damage output, so killing stuff is as simple as targetting it and hitting
autoattack (no special attacks). If you need aggro, start casting stuns. If
you're soloing, once you're beat up you can either root, step back, and heal
or try and channel a quick heal (paladins have a nice fast CE version) on
yourself. Your disciplines are rarely useful. Breaking mez is Taunt, Taunt,
Stun, attack. You are now a very passable paladin, have a nice day!

    Start stunning like a madman, if they need space to run from the mob use
root. Be ready for the save with Lay On Hands.

    Was about to mention that. ;-) I'd take him up on the offer. At worst,
you get a 24/7 Bazaar mule.
