This sounds like you could be the victim of what I call CPU spam,
either intentional or not. Two sources can cause this. One, programs
you have loaded into the background to serve one function or another.
Instant messaging programs, anti virus programs, the helper
applications for other software packages (like the 10 or so things
Corel Office throws on your taskbar) and so on. The other one is
spyware. Lots of programs you download on the internet contain
software that searches your hard drive for information advertisers can
use, and then sends it over the internet to the source when you are
online. LOTS of stuff you download that is supposedly shareware is
this. Weatherbug, most MP3 file sharing programs, and the print driver
of the print to file utility from Kinko's all contain this. You can
even get these annoying little things simply from surfing on sites,
doubleclick pop ups put them on your system. 

The cure is to go to www.lavasoft.com, they provide a free utility to
track down the spyware and destroy it - it works great. It's called
ad-aware, if for some reason it's not on the site anymore you can find
it somewhere else.
