    It's actually on my nightly "vendor set-up" checklist:

(1) Restock mule with tailored items/junk I found during the day to cap her
at 30 items.
(2) Look for underpriced vendor bait, buy and sell to vendor to raise food
money for the night.
(3) Check everyone else's prices on stuff I'm selling, undercut them.
(4) Set up vendor, then start doing searches on things I'm looking for. If I
find anything good, break vendor mode and go buy it.

    Stuff I'm looking for right now includes a Heiro cloak for less than 15
K, a number of Twilight Seas quest items for the alts (I'm getting close to
vendoring all the ones on the mule just to make room for stuff that actually
sells), tradeskill components that aren't priced by crazy people (500 pp for
a Superb Rockhopper Hide, *L*O*L*), and minor items for the alts. Sometime
soon I'm going to give each of the alts 2 K to spend and let them go nuts in
The Bazaar.
