I don't know, I have no way of knowing that.  They are just the only two
whips that showed up as secondary slot equippable and Druid equippable on
Allakhazam's.  I think in the notes for Vluudeens Tail there was some
mention of it, but no definitive answer.  Allakhazam does not seem to know
about whatever it is that you have, as the only two that it finds on a
search for druid equippable ones are those two.

Spider Silk Whip?
