    Given the quality of the spec groups, and the legendary quality of
players in Oasis, I'd say yes, ALL the Oasis players come back to train, er,
hunt specs. If they really wanted to be part of the solution, they'd stay
away from Oasis after they first outgrow it.

    Although I have to admit.... recently, to test my anti-undead nuke's
damage output at level 60 while heading to Lower Guk to res a friend, I did
pull a spec. For the record: two nukes and one stun.
