This would only really be worth while if you got a skill up with every
successful combine. Not the random chance we have now, of course all the
recipes would be published on the web and everyone would be GM everything.
Or you could make every recipe have a random item for each person, sure all
the recipes would be published but you would have to use trial and error
still.
But to be honest the current carpel tunnel syndrome of doing trade skills
sucks. DAOC is a little better since you only have to hit a button to do the
combine and you can only make things as you progress close to the skill
required. It also just takes the items from your inventory and uses them,
but this is less imersive.

I would really just like to see the ability to add a stack of things and
just make how ever many items are possible and destroy to overage.
