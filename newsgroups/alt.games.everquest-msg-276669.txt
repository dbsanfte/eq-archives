	Won't work.  There's a very noticable delay especially in how
long video takes to resynch after the switch.  I play on a KVM, one
windows one linux box, and if I accidentally switch to the linux box
I usually come back to a bad situation.  Also, KVM's sometimes lose
mouse and/or keyboard input especially with frequent or rapid 
switching.
