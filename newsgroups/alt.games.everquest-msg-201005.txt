It's full name is Koadic's Endless Intellect.  It increases the mana pool by
250, increases wisdom and intelligence by 25, and increases mana regen by 14
per tick.  It lasts 2 1/2 hours without focus items, and using a simple
workaround, it can be cast on even a level 1 character (it's a group spell).

The trouble it causes is that it makes it far easier for low level casters
to solo rather than group, as they will virtually never run out of mana,
even if they blast nonstop.  This hurts low level melee, as they are harder
pressed to get casters into their groups.  It also hurts lower level
enchanters because many of those folks don't understand that enchanters are
much more useful than for mana regen, and to their minds, KEI renders low
level enchanters obsolete for that reason.
