I've had one (okay many many many) of those guys.

They have a few nicknames:
Train Puller.
Idiot.
Mr. Overpull.
Bard.

Everyone gets out of mana when the battle becomes life and death.  Great
excitement one or two times during the day... positively maddening and
insane, if the puller is trying to do that constantly.

Was in a caster heavy group once, with a bard, who insisted on pulling.  We
all told him we were out of mana (after a train he had just pulled) inside
the Sarnak Fort in Ill Omen (inside front door, NOT ledge).  He tuns off to
pull again.

When the train came, he didn't understand why none of us would help him...
and he wound up running all the way to FV zone (aparently forgot where FM
was).

If you pull so hard you keep your casters OOM... be prepared for an object
lesson in why you have casters in the group.
