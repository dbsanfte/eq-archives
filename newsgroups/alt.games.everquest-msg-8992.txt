The easiest way I have found when playing my ench (or even when playing my
sham) is if you have two mobs so close together they seem like a two headed
beast to root one and tell the group to pull back, then you have a clear
target to mez and there is no confusion for the group (although you will
almost always get one person in your group who doesn't believe in assisting
the main tank..they learn quickly when they discover themselves soloing a
mob thats more than a little angry) Also rooting the one you are going to
mez makes it just a bit easier in case mez doesn't stick first try..or if
one of the tanks breaks the mez by accident it's still rooted (hopefully)
and it won't dive for you before you can mez it again.
