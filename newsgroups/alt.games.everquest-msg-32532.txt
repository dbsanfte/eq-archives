I agree with what you wrote.  Just a few add-on notes.

1) Organize.  Organize.  Organize.  When you form a group and EVERY time a
new member is added, work out who does what.  Make sure everyone understand
each's role.  Talk with the nukers about how they nuke and when they nuke.
Ask the cleric what mana level they feel comfortable with in that zone.  Get
the puller to pay attention only to the cleric's mana level.  If you got a
good cleric, they'll take into consideration all the other casters' mana
levels when deciding when to send out the puller.  Get the chanter to work
up some way to enable the Main Assist to know which additionals are being
mezzed when they're identical mobs.  Along these lines...

2) Have a receiving tank.  The puller should NOT be your receiving tank.  I
prefer rangers as pullers since they can track thus pick and choose what to
go after.  The receiving tank is preferably a warrior with the most HP and
AC and is the one everyone assists.  The receiving tank determines where the
fight will be.  The puller knows where the receiving tank is located and
runs all pulls to them.  If your puller determines where the fight will be,
this can end up being all over the place and sometimes even out of the range
of the healer.  And while the puller is out pulling, the receiving tank is
the group's watchdog.  He watches over the blind meditating casters so if
something pops, it never even has a chance at hitting the casters.  The
watchdog should have a social key that is just for pops.  "ATTENTION!  We
have a t% that has popped.  I'm engaging it now."

3) Puller should be your bulldog.  The one that pulls mobs off the casters.
The receiving tank should NOT move much.  The puller should always have SoW
on.  When you organize, you tell the puller that they're the bulldog and
what that role constitutes.  He brings caster-happy mobs back to the
receiving tank and that receiving tank pulls them off the puller.  The
puller should have a social for this was well.  "ATTENTION!  Pulling %t off
caster.  Bringing back to receiving tank as soon as possible.  Caster move
away as soon as the mob turns to me so mob doesn't aggro on you when I try
to pull it back to receiving tank."

4) Location.  Location.  Location.  Too little thought seems to be given to
location.  Take Overthere for example.  How many groups have you seen have
their campsite on the ledge?  Where has the most corpses?  If you moved a
mere twenty paces to the left (coming out of the valley) to where the twin
trees are, trains don't trample you, goons don't wander by, and only once
have I had the General pay a bloody visit.  A little tactical thought to the
lay of the land saves lives in the short and long run.

5) Pick a big physical object to make your camp by.  A tree.  A big rock.
Something.  Otherwise, you'll have camp drift and that always tends to move
to where the mobs spawn.  Your receiving tank should always keep an eye on
the camp's marker and prevent camp drift.

6) The moment a caster gets hit, the caster should hit a social that says
"ATTENTION!  Get this t% off of me.  I can't cast if I'm being hit."  Never
assume the puller (bulldog) knows you're being hit or that they're paying
attention to the group's life bar (though bulldogs should be).  Don't wait
until you're in danger of dying before letting them know you're being hit.
And don't hit back!  You hit what's hitting you and you just make matters
worse and harder for the bulldog to pull it off of you.  Stand there and
take the beating.  Let the bulldog do their job.

7) Have a page full of eight socials that inform the group of all the above
and what Morelyn wrote.  When I have a new member join my group, I simply
click off all eight socials and ask if they have any questions or objections
to how I want the group set up.  I'd love to have just one social for this
but you can only type so much text on a social key.  I limit myself to one
page of social keys though.  Since doing this, my groups run really well.
We're on the same page.  We know what's expected us of.  I recommend it to
all to do this.  Plus it saves you typing in the stuff everytime someone
joins your group.

If any of the above is bad advice, pipe up.  This is how I handle my groups.
I've found it very beneficial but am always looking for ways to improve it.
