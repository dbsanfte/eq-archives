 From 18 to 50 there are research only spells... but I was primarily 
addressing the 51-60 spells, and I don't think any of those are research 
only.

I also suspect that int casters who are master looters for guilds might 
find research components readily available (just don't sell em to 
vendors when you're "supposed to"), and on servers other than FV they 
have 8 times the bank space to save them till useful.
