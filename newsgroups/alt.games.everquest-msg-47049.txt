Took him solo, with my SK in the low 20's. I could do him and his full spawn
if I had my own HT up.
BTW, mobs get to HT from any range, they don't actually have to touch, nice,
huh?
I did die a couple of times there, it was never an easy fight and if my
health got to low the other Kobolds would aggro.

My SK at 30 can take the pair, altho it's a struggle, ignore the Kings pet,
once the king is dead the other kobolds will kill it. Both are blue to him
at 30, had a crown of the forlorn off the king (lesser version to the black
iron crown) and some cold iron armour. Still looking for a deserving newbie
for these.
I must of killed the king a dozen times before that drop, tho

Muglewump is the baddest thing down there, he is an oversized froglok
tadpole and can hit in the 70's. Casts slow and stun (have never once
interrupted him on either) Nearly always resists Darkness but other dots
seem to stick. When he runs, due to his up sizing, you will not keep up,
even sow'd but he gets stuck in an archway and can be killed there. Some of
his drops are quite good (the Erud Pally/Cleric chest armour is nice) but
they are no drop and I have often left them to rot (never anyone in the zone
to give them too)

Green at thirty, Krode does agg but isn't a worry, I don't bother killing
him much, no idea if he drops anything I think he'd prove more of a handful
than he is worth.

Cave bat lord isn't so tough, nothing in the way of loot tho, mighty bear
paw is a scaled down Cave Kodiak (from Velious) and, as with Muglewump, his
speed is screwed, you won't catch him if he runs unsnared (and he's tough to
catch, snared) drops his pelt which must be for a quest, blue still at 30.

Huntmaster is a high green, still get exp, not that tough but he casts as a
ranger drops a Bow (apparently, never seen it) and an arrow (oh w00t)

If you go there hunting, travel light, the general loot, bronze and (lead
lined)bamboo, is very heavy but you can make good cash for the level selling
it.
