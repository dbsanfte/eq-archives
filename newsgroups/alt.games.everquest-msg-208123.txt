Hi All

With all the debate recently on calling 'Trains'. I thought I would add 
my observation of two new types of train (well new to me)

Both of these types of trains I have seen recently and I wondered has 
anyone else seen either of these before. Are they just rare aberrations 
or the start of a trend?

Both show the darker (read selfish side) of EQ.

The first was on Stromm in Misty Vale. 15 days after launch.

While trying out being a complete beginner and enjoying it.

I and in the worse case 12 others died when a train of diseased rats hit 
the character respawn spot. I put it down to bad luck and continued.

Soon, after numerous trains, there was such a pile of players that 
Hidecorpse became necessary  if you wanted to move from the spot at all.

It became painfully obvious that all these trains, from both sets of 
diseased rat areas, was the work of one person who was surviving the 
trains themselves. Worse still they were deliberately steering said 
trains away from the guards

When challenged he stated he wanted to drive as many people from the 
zone as possible so he could hunt.

/ooc exploded, in the end a guide arrived and expelled said prat.

I put this down to a lone prat.

That was until the other evening!

I found the other type of train!!!

While enjoying a hunting trip with a good group of people on the 
Shadeweaver side of the Paludal caverns on Bristlebane.

/ooc erupted with a "What the +!$% happened there"

Bandit camp No.2 and both of the camps at No.1 had just been wiped by a 
huge train.

This train lingered at the zone in point causing mayhem.

A while later it happened again.

This time the train was spotted by a party hunting near the bridge 
coming down from the Hollowshade entrance.

They thought there was 40+ fiends in the group. they fled and gated.

It then proceeded to wipe camp 2 and the camps at 1again

This time the culprit was spotted as a high level character on a jolly 
lets see how big a train I can make jaunt.

He fled the scene with "a see you later. suckers" type /ooc message.

The discussion in my group afterwards on the idiots motives centred on 
either he was a 'Bought' character who doesn't know any better or 
someone's little brother playing with big brothers account.

Either way it spoiled a lot of peoples fun that night.
