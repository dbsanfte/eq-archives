Get thee to High Keep. Get into a guard room group, or the Lookout room
if not enough people around. If it's full, get on a waiting list. It's
usually not a long wait. You can easily get to 30 in that basement, if
not further, with a bank, merchants, etc. and all required services
right in the same zone.
