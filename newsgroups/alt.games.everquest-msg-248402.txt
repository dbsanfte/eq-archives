You're trying pretty hard to make it sound a lot more complicated than it
would be.   And then stating that the simple version you imagine will be
easily exploited.  With the approprite "OMG, EQ2 will suck because of this!"
lines added in here and there.

And you assume they'll make the exact same mistakes.

If I can quote your other message that you just posted...

"Bandage solution. Disband in advance of the pull, pull, FD, group pulls
retreating mob, join group...admittedly more work, but if it means risk free
spawn breaking..."

Thats the kind of shit I'm talking about.   I'm sure once someone points out
that they could easily make it so pulling a mob as the group was returning
would aggro the rest of the original pull, so your scheme wouldn't work,
you'll just spin in a few more circles and come up with an even more
convoluted plan which you claim will allow "exploit" single pulls every
time.

You do this in just about every thread.   Stop it.
