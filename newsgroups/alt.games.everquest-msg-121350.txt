I've  recently been hanging out in WC. On my way, passing through EC,
I notice that it's non-stop auctioning in EC.  You could buy just
about anything there, providing you are loaded.  Seems like everything
being auctioned is going in the thousands of pp range, 3k for this, 4k
for that.  Does the majority of the population have this much plat ?
Are these auctioneers really getting the asking price for this stuff ?
