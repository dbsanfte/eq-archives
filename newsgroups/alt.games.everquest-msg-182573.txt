The rationalization I've heard for probably reasons for PC froggies
not being enchanters/magicians is simple. PC froggies are different
fromt he old version, they're Mith Marr's chosen and follow him
devoutly. God of Valour. Summoning up creatures and/or stripping them
of their free will to totally mind control them isn't in the spirit of
Marr's purpose... They're more tightly bound by his code.
