It's never worked for me.  In my experience if you assist a mezzed mob 
you're just going to get the person the mob had aggro'd when you mezzed it.  
Any changes to the mob's hate list won't be reflected until the mez is 
broken and you can tell for sure who has the top spot because they'll be 
taking damage :P
