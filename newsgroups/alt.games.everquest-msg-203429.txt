No one seems to take issue with the fact that you won't be able
to take part in the instanced dungeons without 4 other people to group
with. At least it seems to me like in the article he is saying you
need a group of 5, with up to six total possible.

Or maybe I read it wrong.. hmm. It sure sounded that way. I play at 
odd times so mostly solo, this will be yet another expansion offering
pretty much nothing for me. I'm sure like POP with the teleport books,
they'll stick in some feature for their crappy expansion so players
feel they need it even though they can't explore it.

I'm getting tired of this, maybe its time to go. The last expansion,
in this game which is only saved by new expansions, that I could
really play was Luclin. I exhaust expansions far sooner than a new
expansion comes out and now I can't even take part in any new ones if
I wanted to.
