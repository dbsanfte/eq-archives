You actually can't drown unless you try, though as always YMMV.  Just
keep swimming, in the direction you want to go, you don't sink or
anything like that, you will just slow down some when your stamina is
depleted, and you will get your swimming skill up in the process. 
Biggest thing you will want is some way to survive the fall into the
firepot room (going by stories, haven't actually used it myself).  As i
understand it, it's like you swim down a ways, and then reach open space
where the ceiling should be, and fall to the floor.
