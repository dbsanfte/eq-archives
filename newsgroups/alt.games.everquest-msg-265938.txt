As you know, NPCs now talk to you as you walk by them, enticing you to 
interact with them to help solve their problem. I forget exactly where I 
was, I believe it was deep in the Crypt of Betrayal (accessible from within 
Vermin's Snye, which is within the Down Below). After clearing our way to 
the room with this NPC, he made some comment on approach that suggested to 
me that I look around and search for "the others". This launched a quest to 
find three NPCs within the Crypt, and this quest remained open in my book 
today because we never got past that room and wiped several times trying. 
Well, ok. I figured there were other NPCs we had to make our way toward and 
as we were preparing to move on, I noticed a statue on the right and decided 
on a lark to get closer and Examine it. Sure enough, this "other" launched 
his own subquest. I didn't complete this one, either, but everyone in the 
group ran up and got his quest and then spent the next five minutes scoping 
out the rest of the room ...

There are other places where an NPC will make reference to some object 
nearby that yields up a quest. IIRC, a skeleton down in the Library within 
Stormhold makes reference to a book nearby that also launches a quest.

I've only seen a few of this type, and I suspect they are rare. Or, maybe 
we're just not used to much interactive content in our MMOGs. Dunno, but I 
do know that I listen carefully now and I scan around a lot for signs of 
something distinctive or unusual).
