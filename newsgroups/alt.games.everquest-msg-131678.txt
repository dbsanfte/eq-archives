know what i do?

i have nearest npc (default f8 i think) mapped to numpad enter (big fat
button in corner, on edge)

then i have attack mapped to the big fat plus sign above the enter key, on
the numpad


then i run up to things and mash them both down


. . . until i started my enchanter, then i had to click, and clicking
sucks - and there's nothing you can do about it, except use AOE stuns ( i
always keep 2 + aoe mem blur up, except in kael) to make up for the time it
takes to click the bastards

and then eventually you get an aoe version of everything, so no more
clicking, just alt+spell_slot_number

yay

figures there's never going to be another opportunity in life to mention the
nifty, simple target + attack setup he has
