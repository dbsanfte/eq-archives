    The first situation sound suspicious to me.  The dungeon aren't that
hard to find, imho.  And I've heard a few accounts of people absconding
with LDoN loot.  This expansion might be bringing out the greedy side in
some people.  Seems rather odd to me, since the expansion is so group
driven.  One would think that sooner or later their rep will say "Hi"
and and smack them across their face.
