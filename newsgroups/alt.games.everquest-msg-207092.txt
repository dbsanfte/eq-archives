These are not regular GMs these are the developers. Things they do
will affect the way the game plays out in a direct way.

One extra line in a script, or a different implementation and *BOOM*!
Flames start on ezboards all over the world.

Again, I kinda wish the /testbuff flag also set you pkill, this would
be pretty self-regulating. At least they could turn peoples name
yellow, and show them clearly as a testbuffee.

I am 30th on Test, and I have friends that testbuffed, but, it is
making life hard for those hardy pioneers there...
