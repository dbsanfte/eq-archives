I've got 2 Win2000 computers networked together at home. I recently got DSL
and since then hadn't been able to surf net on my second computer. With the
advice of a friend I bought a Linksys Etherfast DSL/Cable router (BEFSR41).

My home network is good now, as I can now talk between my computers at
100Mbps. both computers connect to the internet. so everything should be
fine... yes?

but for some reason... now that I have the router, I can't stay connected to
Everquest. I log on fine, get into the game fine. Only to be disconnected
after about 10 minutes back into the World select screen. while playing I'll
have on average 1200-1600 ping showing on my bar. with my dial up I normally
hoverd at about 700. I think this is backwards heh

If anyone has had the same problem and knows how to correct it, I would
greatly appreciate a push in the right direction. home networking, dsl, and
the interaction between them all is kinda new to me so honestly I don't know
where to begin on tweaking/troubleshooting.

Thanks in advance
