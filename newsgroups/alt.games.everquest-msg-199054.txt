1) Don't depend on your weapon damage to kill any mob.
2) Use Harmony to single pull.
3) Use Root to manage adds.
4) Use <both> damage shields if you're gonna melee.
5) Don't depend on your weapon damage to kill any mob.

Black Enameled Mace ain't bad if you insist on having something to
swing with (my 37 Druid uses one, even though he really shouldn't
anymore).  Yes, it can be fun to bite the mobs' ankles.  No, it's
not particularly effective once you're into your 20s.  Really, all
the weapon does is give you something to do while the mob kills
itself on your damage shields.
