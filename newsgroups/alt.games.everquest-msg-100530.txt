Back issues of Dragon Magazine.  A while back (starting around 251, I
think) they put tables in several issues.  Names for Elves, for
Halflings, for Dwarves, for Gnomes, for Drow, et cetera.

That's where I got Caelashebrar Shynt'eylorvir.  First name's from the
Elven table, second from the Drow.  And each one has specific meaning.

A while back I was working on creating a program that uses the tables.
It's fallen by the wayside, but if you want help, say so.
