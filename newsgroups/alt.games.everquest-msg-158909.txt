There are two zone-ins to JP, one in Surefall Glade (problem for

your Iksar) and one in Blackburrow which is, I believe no problem
for anybody high enough to hunt in JP (I'd go through invis first
time in case the Brell worshipping Gnolls on the other side don't
share my opinion).  None of the outpost NPCs wander.  At the
Gnoll cave you will see Gnolls and the PCs hunting them.  Killing
Gnolls gives plus faction with three woodsrunner factions (can't
recall names off-hand).  There's also a faction-raising gnoll canine
turn-in quest that raises the same three factions plus Qeynos Guards,
but you have to turn in to the guard sergeant at the outpost, so
probably need wolf form.  Wolf form is also useful if you're hunting
anywhere besides the Gnoll cave itself, damned wolves and bears will
agro even when green in hopes of trashing your faction.  You might
need to kill a lot of Gnolls to make progress with faction, dunno
how much it hurts to be Cazic follower.  It might make trouble even
in wolf form, I'd be very careful until I conned all the NPCs, but
then you're probably used to that playing an Iksar.
