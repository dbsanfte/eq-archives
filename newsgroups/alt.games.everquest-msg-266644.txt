Unless they took them out in the last week before launch, there are boats.
I saw one pull up to the dock in the Commonlands in beta, and I got on it.
I got a message telling me how long till the boat would leave (nice little
improvement over boats in EQ1 and DAoC).  I didn't stay on, though, because
I didn't actually want to go to where that boat was going.
