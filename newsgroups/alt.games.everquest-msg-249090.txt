Tarrew Marr, which also had the same thing going on for VT years later.
The only thing that stopped VT being exactly like NToV on our server was
that while they were interested in VT, the top 2 guilds were able to
keep a cock block on the Emporer to keep others out. Once they moved on
other guilds tried but not as successfully, leading to rotations having
to be set up on VT too.

Besides, weren't you complaining about keeping out guilds not capable?
Bitching and griefing don't really count as being incapable, much as the
established guilds would like it to be. At least on Tarrew Marr, the
griefing and whining on both NToV and Emporer came as much from the
guilds already capable as those they were trying to keep out, not due to
ability but unwillingness to share.
