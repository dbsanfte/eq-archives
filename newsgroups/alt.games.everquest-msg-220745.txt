To use LoTR as an example... the Wraiths didn't set up camp at Bree and 
gank passersby. They were big and powerful and evil, and had better 
things to do than grief small dirt filled villages...

As far as trolls killing elves and other theoretical ic activity...

Typically on a pvp server that wasn't really that disapproved of... 
unless of course that troll was known to have grouped with said elves 
the day before because he needed a tracker to grind some xp...or had a 
high elf cleric in the background buffing and healing him... while he 
did it. Or ran around shouting how he 'ownzered yo azz'... all of which 
undermine any IC rationale he had for pvping with you...

When I played on RZek, I quite enjoyed doing battle with the 'all 
darkelf' clans, or the troll bandits in the karans... etc... Getting 
doubleteamed while hunting in steamfont by a DE Enc and his Halfling 
Cleric buddy however...
