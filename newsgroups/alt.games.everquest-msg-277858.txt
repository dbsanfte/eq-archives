Yes, but it will be a special co-branded edition with Hotbuttons to 
purchase Adventurpacks and expansions, and probably Yahoo! toolbar 
integration too. (Fuck You Adobe!)

Hehe.

PS and OT... 

If you are sick of the new Adobe 7 Reader at over 65MB installed, which 
takes far to long to load even on 3GHz+ machines, and which now also 
tries to bundle the Yahoo Toolbar into the deal, both on the download 
page, and also with advertisements within the software while you use 
it...

Then try... 

FoxIt, a free pdf viewer, which at 2MB has opened all the typical PDFs 
you might find on the web, at least those that I've thrown at it. I'm 
sure it doesn't do the DRM stuff, and it likely doesn't handle asian 
fonts etc... so you might need to keep Reader 7 around, but I use it 
like I use FireFox & Internet Explorer...(ie using IE only when the page 
is so nonstandard and proprietary that only IE will open it) and am much 
happier with it.

If anyone knows of other better (and free) pdf viewers I'm interested.

Foxit does have a small ad-box in the corner (like acrobat reader), but 
so far a) it only contains a small image advertising their other pdf 
products, b) it can be turned off (although it reappears when the 
software is restarted... but the dev's have promised to fix that in the 
next release... we shall see.)
