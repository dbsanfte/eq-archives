Hi there.

Got a level 24 rogue and have got the intimidation skill up to about 30 now
by hitting the hotkey during fights, but have yet to see ANY effect of it
except the message that says that I'm not scaring anyone.....

What does this skill do?  Is it like a Taunt or Fear?  Should I bother
practicing it at all?  What level does it have to be for me to see it start
doing something?  I'm currently fighting Gobbies in HHK.

T.
