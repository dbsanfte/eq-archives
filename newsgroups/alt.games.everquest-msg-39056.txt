There are a number of good options, depending on what you're mostly
hunting.

On the gnome dock, inside the pirate camp (on top of an igloo was my
favorite), Balix Misteyes' tent, or in the gnoll camp are all reasonably
safe, though occasionally something gets trained in that the locals
ignore or take awhile to kill.  

The zone to EW is rarely trained, but when it is, it's usually by giants
who hit hard.

Just inside ToFS is almost always safe, but it's a pain to have to zone
in and out, and there are often many snow dervishes just outside.

You can camp almost anywhere in the zone if you're invis.
