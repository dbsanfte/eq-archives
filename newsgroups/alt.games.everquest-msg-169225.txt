Healing Gift 1 had a very marginal effect, but I suppose higher
levels of it will be worthwhile, and I'd have to buy the first
level anyway.

I didn't initially understand that the cost per level would go
up, so I thought it would be 2 points, 4 points, 6 points total
spent, instead of something like 2 points, 6 points, 12 points
total spent.  I'd certainly not have wasted time getting the
points to buy anything past run 3 till I capped out leveling; I
got the 3 points of wisdom and the gift in 60 when I knew POP was
coming up, instead of capping out 60 to be really ready to go.

On the other hand, I should have bought DvA first thing after
reaching 61, this is clearly a winner of a AA, and cost only 2
points; heck, at this point I'd advise a level 61 with no AA to
buy 3 points of run, then DvA!
