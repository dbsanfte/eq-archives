I have a real quick couple of questions.
I am on the west coast and currently thinking of switching servers to find 
one with more west coast time zone players and guilds.
1.  Anyone know anything about the rumored server merging?  If it is acurate 
I will wait untill that is done to think abvout any  server changes for me.
2.  does anyone know what servers are primarily west coast?  And any guilds 
on said server that are looking for tank classes.
Thankyou
