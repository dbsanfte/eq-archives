 I think that's the main reason we skipped it. Too much competition. If
we were the only guild that had access to VT I'm sure we'd hit it a
couple days after server starts. We just can't really afford to hit VT
on patch days and let others clear all the Elemental mobs. We're
struggling with some of the more powerful AE mobs but overall we're
still doing ok. Would we do better with VT gear? I don't doubt it.
