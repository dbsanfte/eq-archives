>So how many quests (and which) are actually worth doing ?

Well I personally like the Gem Inlaid Gauntlets quest. If you're a
druid or a wizard it's very easy to do and you get a free 8ac all/all
gloves that give some dex and agi I think. Plus if you're really in
the mood you can have the 4 splitpaw scrolls, the item from the guy in
crow's, the item from the guy in east free port, the second item from
the guy in crow's, and the gem inlaid gauntlets at once. So you can
have a big queue of gauntlets ready to go if you want to sell them.

Also the coldain shawl is really worth doing. You can get up to the
5th shawl before it starts getting really hard and by that time you
have 5ac and 5 of all the other stats it gives and it's a really nice
shawl right there. Then if you ever get the need to go further with
guild help or something you will always have the 5th shawl to start
from and that's only 2 shawls away from the FT 1 item.

I forget most of the other quests I've done but if you're a caster
you'll definately wanna check out the journeyman's boots quest. Just
kill the Ancient Cyclops in Southern Ro Desert, or oot (the place
where the boat travels in between freeport and butcher block
mountains), or very rarely in the Eastern Karanas. He is rare in all
three places but he's less rare in Sro but people will kill steal him
away very easily and he's resistant to fire nukes yet he's only lvl
30. He's lvl 40 in oot and only appears on the island with the guy who
sells mage spells plus that camp is most always camped. As for EK I've
never seen him there but other people have so keep trying. There are
other parts to the quest but once you have the ancient ring from the
ancient cyclops the quest is basically over, mainly because the other
items you need are no rent but fairly easy to get. You need 3250 gold
pieces too, not 325 platinum pieces.

Hope that helps...
