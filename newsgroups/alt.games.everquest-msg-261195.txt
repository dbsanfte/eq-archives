One of the regulars at NOrrath's Studio told that when she was at the game
store, she saw 4 EQ players come in to buy OoW...only there were only 2
copies left.  When she was leaving the store with her purchases the police
car had pulled up to help resolve/calm the scuffle that had broken out.

People like that make me feel a bit better about my own EQ addiction. O_O
