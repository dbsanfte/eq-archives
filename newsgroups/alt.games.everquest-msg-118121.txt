Fishing needs to be updated a bit. The "spilled your beer" sort of
comments are a bit old.

The kind of fish you catch will vary by zone, with some of the fish
being required components in various trade skills. For example,
studded arctic wyvern hide armor requires cod oil, which is made from
cod caught in Cobalt Scar.

In and of itself, fishing isn't extremely useful. You can run a profit
with it, but not as much as if you spent that time in combat. Like
several aspect of the game, for many players it amounts to nothing
more than "color".
