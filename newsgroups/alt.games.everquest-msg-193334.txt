Subject: Upgrade for Cleric weapon and or cheap twink

Trying to upgrade a weapon for a cleric we're trying to PL a bit.  Right now
he's using a screaming mace his damage output seems to suck.  Any
recommendations for a 1hb upgrade for under 2k?  Should we switch him to 2hb to
speed up the damage output for PL'ing purposes.  If so, any recommendations on
2hb for under 2k?  TIA.
