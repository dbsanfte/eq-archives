Farm them yourself.

Having nearly maxed out Wu's in the past couple of days, I've been trying to
buy silk like crazy. Auctioning at 50pp a stack of swatches didn't get a
great deal of response, so myself and a mage who's also tailoring went to EK
and farmed spiders for a while.

Crag spiders tend to drop the most silk (up to 7 at a time on occasion), but
they tend to be farmed pretty heavily, at least on Morell. As a druid you
would have the advantage of track, so you should be able to amass several
stacks without too much tedium.
