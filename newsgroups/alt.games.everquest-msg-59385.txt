Hi,

I have tryed to play with my baking skill these days.

Im currently only at 65 but it goes up fast.

I noticed some meals get magic powers like STR +2 for beer braised bear /
gator or AGI +2 for beer braised Lion

I have searched and has found few advanced meals like chocolate and pies.

Are there any very advanced meals that have more powers than the beer
braised with special recieps and cooking skill involved ?

Lea
