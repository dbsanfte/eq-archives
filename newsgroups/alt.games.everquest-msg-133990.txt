I was assuming velious pants use but what you say makes sense, I'm just not
familiar with the intricacies of cleric PBAE tactics.

That's basically what I was thinking of, 99% of warriors don't have PBAE
weapons though, or enough AA to waste on rampage.  Although, I've seen a few
logs of Flurry 3 enabled warriors, now that's impressive, may not be enough
to make or break an MA on holding agro, but it's definitely a decent DPS
boost for them, takes a lot of AA though to get that far, and a warrior
going straight for Flurry is ignoring a lot of more useful AA paths (AE
taunt, CS3, CA3, ND3 in particular) since Flurry requires CF3 first.

I was thinking more of the epic rune that they can refresh every load, and
grab a HOT while dropping off loads too.
