My feeling is if I'm at the point where I'm asking someone for help
it's usually because I'm at least less than half my HP and the mob
still has most of its HP, and I probably will be dead before I get it
down to less than 50% so I wouldn't be getting the experience anyways.
If somebody does keep me from dying, I'm not going to be complaining
that I didn't get the experience, I'll just be thankful that the
player saved my life.
