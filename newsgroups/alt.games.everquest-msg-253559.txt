A lot of hardware failures give enough notice to allow the machine to be
taken down with notice.  For example, a fan can die, or a power supply
voltage can go out of range, and that will raise an alarm, rather than
immediately crash the machine.  They probably use disk drives that support
SMART, and one of those could have reported that it expects to fail soon.
Of they might have redundant power supplies and one died.  Or maybe a disk
in a RAID failed--that would give them time to shut down with notice, then
they would replace the drive, and the server would be down while the
contents of that drive are rebuilt.
