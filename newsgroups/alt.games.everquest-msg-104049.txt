I find myself in a similar position (though on a much smaller scale)
with an application I wrote for a client. The design I put together
two years ago was ideal for the specifications at the time, but since
then there have been eight more releases, with new features in each
one - and now the design is awful for the current specs. The code is a
terrible mess.

The client recently approached me for a major change to how the
program works, and it looks like I'm going to get lucky - they seem to
understand that in view of all the changes since the first release and
the requested new functionality, the program needs to be rewritten
pretty much from scratch. I'll be able to keep some small individual
routines but the entire general structure has to be tossed out.

Verant doesn't have that luxury - they've got an enormous code base
and several hundred thousand largely unforgiving clients. No thanks!
