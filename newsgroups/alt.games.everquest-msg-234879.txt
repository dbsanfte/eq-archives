It depends... solo or group?

If you plan on grouping, then don't choose a druid, as you are expected to
heal your group most of the time, and tells for buffage etc and thats a task
in itself. All classes have something expected from them... except:

The wizard.
Probably the easiest of all classes to play, since you cant do anything
except root & nuke. There is no management of anything, no buffing, no tasks
except.. press ALT-1 to cast Strike of Solusek on target.
You just press ALT-1 until you get the "not enough mana" message then you
take a break and med to full and repeat. Also, the group doesn't rely on you
for anything, except sometimes doing an evac, which happens about once every
3 months, and even if you where afk when the group wiped it doesn't matter
because they will get 96% rezzed anyway and nobody cares. Going AFK whilst
in group goes mostly unoticed on my wizard, just say "lom" and take an
extended afk. Works like a dream.

Raiding is great for us wizards most of the time. You just target a group
member and autofollow him. Then go afk and come back 1 hour later for free
xp and maybe a roll for an item or something. Sometimes you want to
"semi-afk" and cast a nuke inbetween those pr0n sites you are watching in
Windows. Make a hotkey that reads something:

/assist <MT name>
/sit off
/cast 1
/cast 1

Most wizards at lvl 65 get ultra bored... compared to all other classes i
played up passed 30 (which i think is most of them, except enchanter) i
would say wizards are the most boring and implemented only for those who
need alot of afk's or for those who like multitasking and doing other things
(like watching pr0n etc). It's the closest you can get to being a "bot"
online without getting banned. I would like to see SOE implement an "auto
responder" so we can just get the bot err i mean wizard to say "LoM"
whenever he gets a tell (perhaps make this a wizard aa skill). Also
implementing a "snooper" that waits for the tank to call attack and trigger
the nuke hotkey (another cool new aa skill). Do this, and you got a reliable
wizard bot thats nearly as good as a human player 90% of the time.

The only thing that required skill was quadkiting. This was fun, but SOE has
more or less removed quadkiting as a viable option for playing at end game.
pbAE groups was also passively nerfed (no new pbAE spells). The wizard class
changes at 61+, the fun is over after that. Only thing that keeps a few
wizards playing is to see whether Shock Of Magic crits for 7k the next time
they click it.

If we cut this short thats not alot of work:

1) Check your monitor for the MT attack call
2) Assist MT
3) Press ALT-1 to nuke
4) Meditate 1 minute
5) Recieved "You have gained experience message"? then goto 1
6) Goto 3

You could code a wizard bot in Visual Basic in less than 10 lines. Wizards
aren't self sufficient, so you will be forced to group early (you wont even
be able to kill blue cons in your teens without twinkage).
