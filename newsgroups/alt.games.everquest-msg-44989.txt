Good.

It would also be amusing if they tweaked the game engine so
that GM-event characters could be like level 90 or something:

   You try to slash Firiona Vie, but miss!
   You try to slash Firiona Vie, but miss!
   You try to slash Firiona Vie, but miss!
   You try to slash Firiona Vie, but miss!
   You try to slash Firiona Vie, but miss!
   You slash Firiona Vie for 1 point of damage.
   Firiona Vie punches YOU for 18219 points of damage.
   You have been slain by Firiona Vie!
   Returning to home point, please wait...
