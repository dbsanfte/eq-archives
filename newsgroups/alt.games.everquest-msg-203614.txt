If you want to roleplay, and your character is a loner, then there are
classes in EQ that are more easily soloed than others. 

There is nothing preventing you from RPing and soloing in EQ. Actually
you could solo a rogue (most likely the worst solo class) to 50, but
it would take a very long time. What you can't do is solo and expect
to get the same amount of exp per hour as a well run group. Then again
if you are truly RPing, why would you care about how fast you are
leveling?
