(I dont' have time or patience to fix the top posting)

For those who missed the top posted question, the OP has a machine that
can apparently ge to the character select screen but that's all. One of
our machines had the same problem. Also not a "optimal recommended
stats" machine. You may not have to upgrade. I found we had a corrupted
file.

eqgfx_dx8.dll

Try deleting that and downloading again. You may get in. Ours are both
working now.
