Sorry, misunderstood what your were saying.

I have no say in whether Cox ultimately decides to keep the group or not.
You give me credit for entirely too much power.  However, I can ask Cox to
remove the group from it's listings, and they can do what they will with
that request.  They could poll the users if they wish.  Would it be more
tolerable for you if I wasn't the only one that wanted the group to go away?
If you're going to complain about one group, you should complain about every
one they don't carry (possibly except for the illegal ones).

You haven't refuted it, so I'll assume that my paranoid rubbish is actually
covered ground that you're re-treading.  I wonder if you'll respond with an
acutal argument, or just more personal attacks.

Didn't read the whole thread, did you?  That's my point.  You'll note, if
you're willing to, that the above statement was in response to a similar one
that the poster who wishes to be known as Sean Connery tried to level at me.
I'm just asking him to follow his own advice.

And if the ISP doesn't give them the group in question?

And I'm entitled to not want to have certain groups in my ISP.  Funny word,
"want"... it doesn't mean "get."

Ask if you want, it's your right.  Whether they tell you to get bent or not
is up to them.
