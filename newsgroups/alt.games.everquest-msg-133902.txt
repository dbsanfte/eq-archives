Precisely, when you don't know the answer, keep your mouth shut.
He not only didn't know, he KNEW he didn't know, yet insisted on
spreading the kind of misinformation that has hurt mages acceptance
in groups in the past.  I can't begin to count how many times I was
told to lose the pet when I was starting out because "If it gets the
killing blow it takes 50 percent of the xp."  That was the prevalent
theory at one time, and people without a clue continued to spread it
like bloody gospel.
