Its not just possible it is close to optimum to have 2 clerics . A necro or
paladin works well in the puller function but a cleric does it BEST !  Heals
are essential for when a mob resists both stuns , and cleric aoe is by no
means shabby .

Since I ran up over 100 AA in a coupla weeks on my chanter using the 2
cleric aoe model I know damn well it works best :p
