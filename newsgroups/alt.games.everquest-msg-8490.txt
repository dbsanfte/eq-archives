Agreed. I learned early on that researching quests beforehand does not
impede upon my enjoyment of exploring the game world, as I initially thought
it would because such research would "spoil it" for me. No way! I pay to
play this game, and it takes a LONG TIME to get anywhere ... why waste time
on lousy quests? Or unfinished ones? Or quests that are too high level for
me?

Sheesh, I remember being a wee little newbie level 4, thinking I could go do
the Clothspinner Sisters quest in Qeynos. Like other quests, I went after
that thing gung ho. Until I realized that I spend hour upon hour wandering
West Karana, running in fear in North Karana, and generally getting, lost,
killed, and both. No thanks.

But with a bit of research, I've found that some quests are quite enjoyable
to do, and still others very worthwhile. Few and far between, yeah, but
they're there.
