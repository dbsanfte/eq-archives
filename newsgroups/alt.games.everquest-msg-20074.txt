It depends on how you're wanting to play the game ... if you're going to
play solo at later levels then a druid is better than a cleric ... however
in a group the cleric is going to be chosen over the druid just about
everytime (unless they have one already).

Druids get snare (slows mobs down to walking pace) and get pretty decent
spells (damage over time and nukes), necro and wizard get better versions
respectively.

Clerics get really nice buff spells and are much in demand at later levels
in groups due to their healing powers and they can resurrect <sp> you when
you die (saves a long walk most times esp. for the melee classes who have to
run from the city where they're bound ... and restores some lost exp)

Of course there are many many race / class combinations to try out and as
has already been said you should try out a few to decide on which one you
enjoy playing ... also I'd do some research on creating your character so
you don't put points into stats that are useless to your character like I
did :)

http://eq.castersrealm.com/ and http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ are good
places to start

Yeah ... druids need to be intelligent so I'll put points on INT .... DOH!
