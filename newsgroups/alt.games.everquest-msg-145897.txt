Wrong and wrong.  There are some mobs in the game that would eat
an invis caster but are great resting places for a tired rogue.  Also, rogue
invis covers both Invis AND Invis to Undead, and is the only Invis in the
game that does.  Also, higher levels may have a CHANCE to see through
your sneak/hide, but it is most definately a rare event.  It's like an
anti-lottery...
it could happen, but don't count on it happening to you.

And sneak is 100% effective on every single mob in the
game.  100%.  That is not a made up number.  You used to
could hand things to Innoruk himself by sneaking around,
and he hates everybody (it's sorta his job).  If you can work
your way out of LoS of a critter and sneak behind him/her,
you WILL NOT aggro them...with a successful sneak this
is possible at level 1for a halfling to sneak up to the level
55+ dark elves in Kithicor...they may randomly occasionally
see through Hide on such a low level, but NEVER through
sneak.

Root poison and run 3 is the only trick I know...at least until Fade
refreshes.

<snip part about rogues not having Gate>

I wish there was a Gate item in the game...but at least now there ARE
some 'port potions.  If you're really a scairdy cat, get a halfling-only
version
of the Leatherfoot raider cap...usable from inventory by all/all and it's an
INSTANT cast Gate to WC.  I'm happy with FoB and Frost potions,
and Thurg gate potions if I've got one on me.

Not as good as Gate, and most definately not good in the middle
of melee (although my rogue should have a channeling skill with
as many items and such he clicks on...;-)  ).  You pays your money
and takes your chances.

>I kept reading how wonderful and necessary rogues were at corpse retrieval.

Well, in Kael, we suck.  I HATE the see-invis only portions of Kael...even
places like Chardok where the dogs sometimes sniff you out, you can at least
work on pathing to sneak past.  In Kael off the path, everything fucking
sees you and that's just anti-rogue coding as far as I see.  But I am a bit
biased...

Aye...lots of places I'd rather have a monk/necro/sk pull my corpse,
just because if I screw up I'm dead again...if they do, they can get a
FD off.  And the necro/sk can just bring your body to the zone-in anyways...
30 minute pathing CR through Dragon Necropolis, or 2 minute/100 pp
CR? Hmmm...

That's fine.  Ask jazz how he thought about his wizard before some of the
wizard pre-50 changes.  Anybody in their right minds loved wizards 50+ when
Velious came out, even moreso with Luclin and AA skills.  But the wizards
don't need 'em so much like they used to...it slows their exp down from
quadding.
Rogues still MUST have a group to level effectively.  Sure my main and alt
can solo some...but I'll take a Chardok group anyday over pulling only
light-blue
con ember hornets, while praying that the dark blue ones are level 40 and
not 41 (because I can kill a level 40, but a level 41 will kill me...period.
The
margin is THAT slim for a solo rogue).  A rogue must have groups to get his
main skill (backstab) up, and doesn't have a get out of jail free card like
a monk. Many times I've finished exping somewhere only to have to sneak
my way out...a caster would just gate and a monk with a RL emergency can
just FD/q and get up.  It's just part of the reward that you completely and
totally suck ass for 45 levels that you can now walk into a Mycanoid Spore
King camp at level 60 over the ranger that's been sitting at the zone for
2 hours.
