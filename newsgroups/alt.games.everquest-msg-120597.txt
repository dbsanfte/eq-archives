 _____________________________
This policy seems pretty restrictive! What kinds of names are encouraged?


We try to promote names that are descriptive and encourage role-playing.
Treehugger, Giantslayer, Windwalker, Stormcaller etc. are all examples of
surnames that are encouraged and allowed. The variety of names and
combinations that don't violate naming policy is varied and broad. We urge
you to use creativity when choosing a name for yourself. After all, you and
your name will be inseparable as you travel the many roads of Norrath! If
you are still having problems after visiting this support section, you can
contact our Technical Support Department through an email via our online
form.

Looks like they encourage it, actually ...
