Afternoon, folks.  Well, early morning, in fact, but hells, it's afternoon 
somewhere, right?

It's been a while since I played EQ.  Having had a brief flirt with Star 
Wars Galaxies (which is very very gorgeous graphically but has nothing on 
EQ for atmosphere), I kinda decided that Norrath was where the heart is.

But there's a couple of things (three, in fact) bugging me and I thought 
this place, amongst all you knowledgeable types, was the place to ask.

Right, first off... The tunes irritate me.  I turned 'em off.  But I've 
got loads of tunes I'd rather listen to.  Yeah, I know it's not hard to 
bring a stereo into the room and play them on that, but I do like to 
complicate things, if I can.  So, although I've read nothing about it, 
heard nothing about it, so it's pointless even asking - but as a stubborn 
Dark Elf I'll ask anyway:  Does EQ have any kind of built-in MP3 player, 
like so many games these days do?

Second question is an in-game one:  What the hell's the First Fragment of 
Igok; why did I meet it in Nektulos; and what with it looking like a 
Froglok, and all, why did my Froggy factions go UP when I killed it?  
(Hey, I'm Teir'Dal - if I don't understand something I attack it and see 
what happens, all right?)  Yeah, I know, read the damn storyline, and all 
that - but there's an awful lot of storyline to catch up with and I'd 
really appreciate the condensed version on this point!  :o)

Third and last, a technical question:  I'm running EQ with expansions up 
to Planes of Power on a WinXP system using an ADSL connection.  
Something's irritating: Every now and then on the menu screens, the 
program focus seems to go to something behind the game, meaning that the 
game's mouse cursor sits in the top left corner while I jiggle the mouse 
like a good 'un.  Yep, I've tried shutting down all other running programs 
before loading EQ but this problem still occurs.  Anyone got any ideas?

Thanks for reading, folks - and if I don't talk to you again a Happy New 
Year to all o' yez!

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
