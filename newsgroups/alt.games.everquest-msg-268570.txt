Not many people knew of it in beta, either, and almost no one on Antonia 
Bayle has heard of it. It's a great place to level up and pull some decent 
experience, but we stopped going there mostly because it really got boring 
after a while cycling back and forth endlessly. For those who remember 
fighting gobbos in HighKeep, this is basically that experience with less 
waiting and better loot. Still, it's a neat find and everyone you take there 
is, like, wow.
