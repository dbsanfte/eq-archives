Yeah, it sucks, we've done it 4 times, and hope to never have to do it 
again.  For the horde of mobs, we have a bard kiting them on the island.  
The splitting spider, we have several tanks ready to grab agro very fast 
(AE taunt, Stun, or whatever Sks use (snare I think)).  Still, usually a 
few people get beat on some, and usually a few die.  For the kiting bard, 
have backup.

If you are going to lock down the horde, then be sure to have spare 
mezzers, and also lock them down away from the splitters.

Make damned sure that whoever you have loot the key parts will be someone 
who is going to be around for a long time, we had to repeat the ring a 
few extra times due to losing our key holders.  Rogues are best for this, 
unless you want to fight to the portal each time.
