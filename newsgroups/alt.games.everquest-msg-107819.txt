Hi:

Thank you all for the answers given, I'm enlightened enough now to MQ
JBoots, though it *is* kinda scary to think that someone might have given
Hasten 3,250 gold and maybe a Rapier just mess up somebody else's quest.
Assuming *I* had JBoots and was multiquesting another ring I might have, I'd
not be able to receive another set of JBoots, so what would happen to the
JBoots if someone had already give Hasten cash and the Rapier if I already
had my boots? Interesting ...

Safe hinting as always to you all ..

Stevie.
