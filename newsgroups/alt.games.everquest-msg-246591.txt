I truly do wish you good luck .. The new expansion of EQ is likely to
be a tier 2 expansion of DX9.  I can best explain this by referring to
two current DX9 games Halo and Far Cry.

Halo is a DX9 game (Tier 1 my terminology).  This game will not allow
you to use AA or any of the super eye candy that current top line cards
can implement with DX9.  This game may be able to be run on the current
crop of second rate cards (including the current top line Nvidia
cards).  But very very slowly.

Far Cry is a more challenging graphics game (1st person shooter) it is
what I will call a Tier 2 DX9 game ... these are the features I believe
that SOE are trying to emulate with EQ and eventually EQ2.  If you had
a top line Radeon you would be able to see raindrops hit the ground and
bounce back up.  This game utilises Vertex 2 shaders to give the eye
candy.  This is what the next expansion should bring to EQ.

You can download a demo of Far Cry here:

Be warned it is a shade under 500MB ... some gaming magazines have it
on their cover disks if that is a bit much.  Run it with your Nvidia
hardware (all eye candy turned on).  Let us know how it goes because
that is what I believe you will get with the next EQ expansion.
