Just be careful not to run too high on the wall... 2nd floor aggro through 
the floor is -annoying-.  And make sure people are informed that if they 
get aggro on the way to SS, they should stand and die instead of dragging 
it back with them and getting everyone killed.

Seems pretty obvious, but... :)
