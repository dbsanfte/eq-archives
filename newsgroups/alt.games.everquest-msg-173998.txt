Has anyone else noticed that the engine only renders what you see, now?  
Before, I could stand in the bazaar bank and face towards the hundreds of 
traders.  I would lag if I tried to turn, even though I couldn't see the 
traders because the wall was in the way.  Then, I would face the other 
wall, away from the traders, and wouldn't get the lag.

Now, I do the same experiment and I only get the lag when the traders are 
"seen" by my avatar through the banker window.

Nice.

Also, after the big patch, I zone faster.  I guess this has to do with the 
new zlib compression and me receiving the zone data faster.  The names 
above people are also better; sharper instead of jagged.  It used to be 
like it was a bitmap font that was getting resized.  Now, it's like a 
TTFont that is scaling properly.

Mobs and characters seem sharper, too, but that may be because everything 
seems darker now.  If I turn the gamma up, though, it washes the colors 
out.

All improvements, to me.  I haven't even messed with the window-mode.  The 
only problem I have see is that the compass was messed up after the quick 
patch last night.  I hope they fixed it on the second patch.

Now that they've added windowed-mode, I guess they are using more directx 
standards instead of their own code.
