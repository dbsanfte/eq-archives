Two(Head) can play at that game.  This was originally posted in April of
1999 to the old Avault forum, but thanks to the LAMO archivist appears
here to calm any fears you might have had that you are the only crazy
one around here

GAITIN BACK TO KITHICOR
       (Apologies to Creedence Clearwater Revival)


        Just got home to Rivervale, lock the front door oh well
        Got to set down take a rest from the trail
        Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm packin
        Doot doot doot headin out to Kithicor

        Giant doin cart wheels, a kodiak in high heels
        Look at all the happy creatures dancing on and on
        Commonlands are busy, tracking all the griffs makes me dizzy
        Doot doot doot headin back to Kithicor

        Aviaks and elephants are playin in the sand
        Won't you take a ride on the hulking Droon doot doo doo
        Wondrous apparition  provided by magician
        doot doot doot gated back to Kithicor

        Aviaks and elephants are playin in the band
        Won't you take a ride on his brother Broon doot doo doo
        Die with me tomorrow, today I'll find no sorrow
        doot doot doot gatin back to Kithicor
