Not that i'm aware of. Any person can setup the expedition after group
is formed by saying either 'vxed' or 'tipt' to the Apprentice at the
leadup to the mountain pass zone in. Its possible that I was just
always in a party where someone had 4 sewers flaggage, but even when I
didn't have it i was setting up expeditions for there.

For most of Tipt... as long as your tactics are sound and you keep
refreshing the charm constantly after sets of fights to minimize bad
breaks... CoD pet tanking can work pretty well. Midway through you hit
the mama crag rare which can drop one of four different augs. As per
getting all the way through tipt... yes you need a tank up in the mid
9k range or preferably higher with shielding and i would suggest if
you get one have your pet go dps with fast patches on the tank.

Vxed is even easier... just kill 25 mobs at zone in and then fight
your way to hail mob. You'll kill 25 more on the way which will spawn
it. If you allready have someone with the flag and they have an invul
disc or can DA just train the mobs in and near the camp at the end
away... walk up and hail.
