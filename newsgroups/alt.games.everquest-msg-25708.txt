It isn't the text that jitters. Everything But the Book/view screen jitters.
If I move the mouse a small square around them mouse stops jittering and
follows the mouse around.

Someone said that changing resolutions causes jitter. I'm assuming that is
the breif jitter that comes and goes relatively quickly. When I first sit
down I have no jitter. after a brief time the cycle starts and then stops
(The patch where my mouse is/has been is jitter free tho)

I can play and do play regardless of this Heh... call me a 'junkie' *Grin*
but the jittering is annoying and was wondering if anyone had any ideas how
stop it? My luck it's a combination of cheap video card and *Curses* Compaq
heh
