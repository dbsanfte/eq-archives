Have you tried the Firiona Vie server. It is labelled "Role-Play
Preferred", and you will find lots of players to just hang out and
talk to that aren't solely interested in the levelling treadmill.
There is a massive amount of back story and lore to discover
throughout the game if you take the time to seek it out.

You can do these things in EQ as well. The tradeskills in EQ have
improved greatly over the years, and a player could spend years
devling into them if they so desire.

The "trick" to EQ is finding a group of players/friends that share
your style of playing. EQ is about the journey not the destination. If
you focus solely on leveling, then you will quickly burnout when you
hit the mid-high levels where leveling becomes much harder or when you
top out at 65.
