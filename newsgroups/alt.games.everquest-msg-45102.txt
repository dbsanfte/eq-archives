Could've been a coincidence that there were widely reported lag
complaints from guildies through-out Norrath I suppose. And when half of
ToV went LD immediately after a 2 line server spam, it could've
conceivably been their ISPs I suppose. The fact that a GM was one of the
LD (GM, not guide - ie: VI employee playing local to servers) was just a
freak coincidence too.
