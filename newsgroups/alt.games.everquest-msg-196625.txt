I'm not trying to get a show of hands as to whether I'm a twink or not.  I'm
trying to show the degree of twinked-ness to give some context to my reports on
leveling this specific shaman up.

I think this list is less useful for the purpose than the one that showed my
increase in various stats, but someone asked me to list by item, so here it is.

The hope is that when people say "oh he can only do that because he's mad
twinked out, its not a function of the class at all" it will now be easier to
see to what extent that is true.

Very helpful would be if some untwinked shaman would post a similar list for
various level shamen (shamani? Shamans?  Shamies?)  to give some sort of
baseline.  At level one, and extra 500 HP was outrageous, but by level 28, its
only doubling my HP, how much item HP do most shamans seem to have by this
level?

Looking at my little chart, I think the only items that seem out of line are:
HP, AC, Regen, Haste.  So heck, maybe poll your friends with shamans and see
what they have for those four stats.  Or prove me wrong and also ask about Wis
and Mana, perhaps I'm way ahead of the curve there too, but I doubt it.

I'm reasonably certain that by 50 if I kept this equipment loadout I'd be not
ahead, but behind the curve.
