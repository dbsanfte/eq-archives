Well, also if you're in an area where there are a lot of traders
clustered around, you can try to right click on the guy you want and
end up getting someone else nearby (including the trader standing
behind you).  That wouldn't explain the guy who did it 17 times, but
if the original poster had limited it to 4 times or so, that jackass
could have been me!  When there's so much lag involved in moving
around, and when there's a cluster, it can be damn difficult to open
the right merchant's wares.

I mean hell, does anyone keep PC names on when they go around in the
bazaar?  That would just kill my feed.

Yes, I'm one of those guys who *won't* buy from the 1pp undercutters. 
I figure 1pp isn't a big enough incentive to give my money to an
asshole.  I price mine the same as the lowest seller (or higher if I
think it's really worth more than that!) and just hope the buyer likes
my mule's name better than the other guy(s).

Also, another really annoying thing, it's so prevalent that I've
stopped looking.  I *hate* the fact that so damn many of the traders
are anon.  Do you guys have any idea how much easier it is to find
someone when you know who you're looking for?
