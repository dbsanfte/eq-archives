That's weird.  My warrior (also human, but 37th Level) had been in Lavastorm
(post a SolB raid and an impromptu Najena walkthrough), and when she left,
the DEs were Threatening to her.  They'd never been threatening before.  I'd
just supposed that I'd, erm, killed something that dropped me from dubious
to threatening. . .
