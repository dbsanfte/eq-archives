I have finally finished my moth wing quest and can honestly say i loathe the
tier 1 zones about freeport. I want to finish my collections (shattered bone
etc) and i don't want to pay absurd prices on the market for them.

Can i harvest the items in tier 2 zones? so far i think the collectable was
a beetle shell but it was a whiel back and it might have been a drop.
