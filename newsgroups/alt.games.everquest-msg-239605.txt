My cleric, warrior, and necro always carry sow potions.  I'm on Tholuxe Paells
and can usually buy a 10 dose potion between 75 and 90 plat.  
My shaman can make them but she is level 30 and not very good at it.  They cost
her 112 plat to make a 10 dose, so it's cheaper for me to buy them than make
them at this point.
