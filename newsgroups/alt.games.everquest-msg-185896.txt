From the shadows, the mysterious Tab@tab.tabcom (if that IS his real
name) conspiratorially whispered:

You are correct. Remember the people running EQ now aren't the ones
who were at first. There has been a definate shift in focus and some
of the integrity of the game has been compromised. The two places most
affected by this: transfers eliminated the community buildup that
happened on new servers. There is effectively no point to going to a
server that allows transfers, it is exactly the same as all the
others. The second thing compromised as you will mention soon is PoK's
easy transport system. However this is a consequence of a mature game;
no one has the early wonder anymore anyways.

For a new game, however, they should definately NOT be allowing
transfers and should NOT have a PoK system if they want their world to
have exotic, far off places.

This is so true. PoK was a convenience, but a convenience for the
wrong attitude. There was more (in the original Vision) to the world
than maximizing your exp gaining efficiency - it was actually supposed
to feel like a world. PoK completely wrecks this. Even Nexus damaged
it. But, like I said before. this is a consequence of a mature game
where this is more or less expected behavior now. The wonder, the
sense of it being a world, is more or less toast. The only exotic
places left are Western Wastes and deeper in Velious, and Grey/Umbral
and the deep dungeons in Luclin. Everywhere else is just a step away.

It's not a world anymore, it's a collection of zones all connected.

This above all else showed that the current group running the game
really don't care about its integrity anymore.

The whole game is maligned. EQ has been in its mature stage for a
while now, and now I think it is starting to hit its old age,
declining age (which will probably last several years). I've felt this
way for a while now, seeing the "New Money" so to speak become uber
and think they're the shit. Nothing MEANS anything anymore. 


>Some lower end content has been perfect though, like the new class
>armour quests.  Seems like too little, too late, unfortunately.

Many of the things added to EQ are obviously more or less tests for
future games, like EQ2.

Not silly, perfectly understandable and correct.

For you, EQ has probably run its course. You are not alone.
