Who cares? This is LDoN.

People *that* concerned about a tick on their exp bar aren't worth
grouping with in the first place.

If you take the time to actually read the situation as it was posted,
it was clear that there was no time for a second shot at it. If you
then take the extra three seconds to read my post, you'll realize that
I suggested succor for situations where you do.

My advice: read the posts you're replying to.
