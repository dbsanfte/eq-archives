First Option (bad): If you'd like to leave your system on overnight, and you
don't get disconnected, it might be worth it.

Second Option (better): You can also check some stores. A limited amount of
CDs have been made available for sale.

Third Option (best): Finally, find someone with the expansion. Have them go
to SOEs site and copy the specific files listed for LoY to a CD. You can
then copy those files to your system. (This is legal.) As soon as you
register (pay) for the expansion, you will be able to immediately use it
(and you won't have to download anything).
