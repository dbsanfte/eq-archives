Got the same runaround @Best Buy not having the SOL altho the local software
boutique had plenty...kinda makes you wonder.  Then picked up the THREE cd's
that could have all the code you could ever want (of course you'd have to
leave out the movie advertisements that way)  Simply login to validate &
we'd all be killin'
    Did the patch update, have 8.1 directX & at 22:30EST & am getting
"Checking for updated files...." so don't feel alone.  Am I whining...yep,
but I'm also a paying customer....
