missions?

Sorry, just now seeing this post. Not much advice I can give on this one,
the see-invis mobs are notoriously evil and everyone loves to hate them.
Basically, you're at the mercy of random invis and have to have very good
presence of mind to stop and re-invis in the right location when you see the
"You are starting to appear" warning, or know *exactly* where to run to when
you aggro. I've been in trouble many times in Barindu and made a quick
beeline for the Ferubi zone-in, I don't think I've ever failed to get there
alive when I've been out in the Barindu courtyard. That's really your best
bet for that situation. The only times I've died on the run is when invis
drops during that long, u-shaped hallway when you first enter Barindu, I'm
always on the edge of my seat during that run knowing that the odds are
*probably* with me, but won't always be. And of course, if the see-invis dog
is running around there, you gotta stop and stay out of his way.

All in all, I *love* the tension. Yeah, I've died and cussed at SOE for
making it so damned difficult to get to an expedition alive, but this is
exactly why it is so much more rewarding when you DO get through them all.
