You don't say what sort of graphics card you have but if its a GEF3 or
4 there is an "issue" with the Detonator 45.23 drivers which cause the
symptom you describe. It affected me and going back to the 44.03 set
sorted it. Could well be a faulty PSU, worth having checked out.
If that's not it, I'd check your CPU temp in BIOS next time it
re-boots. 60 or over is suspect. Could also be bad or mis-matched RAM,
or just a Billyware fuck-up.


Good luck!
