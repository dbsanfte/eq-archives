I keep trying to explain to people I group with when i play my shaman that i
can get to full mana if they bind wound me. Injured after battle, we sit and
i cast and canni while they bind. The last tank has probably hit the hyper
regen stage before i can get to him, and doesn't need my heal, and I have
mana so long as the bandages hold out. It's amazing how many people are
unaware they have the skill, or think it worthless because they only ever
got a few points out of it.

I have seen an emptying of zones, making soloing and duoing much easier.
Also, the quality of gear for a soloer has generally improved; being able to
get an ornate helm for 5 K seems amazing to me, and I picked up some gloves
for my monk which are nearly as good as an epic for 20K. Since Velks isn't
as crowded as it was, yet demand for velium seems constant (I believe it's
used as a smithing skillup (and the GoD smithed weapons are hoooj!) I can
fight there with few trains.

I love my monk. He can fall terrifying distances in that maze, and play
possum if things go awry. I'm fighting DB mobs with nice drops and I haven't
died in 3 levels fighting there. I die in DSP fighting light blue mobs,
usually because I'm being trained or dealing with people bitching about the
way they camped the whole cave complex singlehandedly and could i leave ther
zone pls?!1!

Sigh. 224 tailoring. When I get to 242 I will never fight in that wretched
zone again.

I know of lots of necros who are having a ball soloing ... they aggro kite
in the planes. One druid I was grouped with today said that his role
nowadays was to play rabbit; he snared and flame licked whilst being chased
by a mob who was chased by a pet. I find the summoning mobs make me leery of
exploring solo but now I've got my 75% heal, mebbe I'll group more. It's a
shame that places like maiden's eye and umbral plains seem abandoned now.
