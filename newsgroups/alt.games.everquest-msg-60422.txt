Hi

Thanks for the posts, gonna give it  shot tonight   =)

The main reason I posted looking for advice was, I had read another post
earlier in the month from someone saying that they were trying to recover
their corpse from Kael and having probs, and the thought of    "Oh, Kael
must be a bit nasty" had stuck in my head, heh.

Thanks again, great advice!

Willough
