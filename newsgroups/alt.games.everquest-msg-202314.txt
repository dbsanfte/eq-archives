honestly mate, it's no crime to sacrafice ac, or hp, or ANY stat for a haste
item

if you are really worried about your tanking abilities, stick to 1h weap +
shield

any fast weapon is good aggro in the hands of a pally

but if you have your heart set on schw, make money and buy them--

the trick is to go to kunark, where every mob drops money (even tigers, yay)
and group with twinks

twinks will let you loot the measly 1p - 4p on each corpse

by the time you're 45, you'll be able to lay down the cash for a nice new
pair of handwraps

OR, you can farm greenies like pc bandits or spiders for silks to sell, but
those methods are inferior
