Hi Monual,

I've just finished helping one of our GL's to completed this quest (up to
the 9th ring anyway - 10th'll be tricky.) - so bizaare that we didn't run
into you while doing it.  Must have been a close behind you though by a day
or two.  However, I had a thought on this comment of yours:

 "I'll probably never get the Tenth Ring, which requires an entire raiding
force to help the dwarves defend Thurgadim from a full-scale attack by the
giants."

Judging by all your other posts, you're quite often looking for raids and
things to do when PoT is otherwise occupied.  Surely you could rouse up a
few groups from ST to help you out on this.  It'd be a fun distraction from
your full-on raiding wouldn't it or are you keeping Marrtuk seperated and
away from guild?

I'd love to hear how it goes.........

I've never read an account of the 10th ring war... should be interesting.
