    At low level, you will get pasted in groups repeatedly. All it takes is
one person that doesn't know what an assist is, or one mob with
higher-than-normal resists, and you're on the floor. The only things I can
suggest are plenty of aspirin, lots of HP gear, and use Charm if someone
keeps breaking mez. At least melees can't break Charm. =/

    You have summarized a good deal of the whining on message boards with
one sentence.

    An enchanter is only going to be outdamaging a group if one of two
conditions is met. One, he hastes the pet and risks being crushed by a
single Word of Morell resist. Two, if the group he's outdamaging sucked.
That's it.

    A solo enchanter won't be killing through stuff faster than a balanced
group. There's too much uncertainty and delay when they switch pets for
that. And they have to switch pets because they lack the capability to heal
the pet, to allow the pet to mem blur to max health, or even to effectively
turn the pet during Enrages. They may make more XP than an individual in a
balanced group. In fact, I guarantee they will. But they can't clear faster.
You even see that when charm soloing. When I partner with a guild
necromancer, we can keep the entire undead area of CoD clear. Without me
there, the necromancer cannot do that. So when you talk about reward, you
also need to talk about item drops.

    The humorous part in all this will be when people run into raid fights
that were balanced assuming the adds would be charmed, since they cannot be
mezzed. And yes, there's more than a few of those in PoP. Enjoy the CR!
