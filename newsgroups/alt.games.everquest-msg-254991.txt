Ive been playing EQ for a few months now and have moved on to my
second toon. A dwarf warrior.  Ive been playing him for a few weeks
now and see Ive laready made a big mistake, I made him agnostic.  I
found some real nice underfoot armor out there but cant use it.

Ive been reading a lot of posts on different boards but most people
posting seem to think everyone already knows all the abreviations for
armor and weapons.  My first few questions are about agro.  

-Is it easier to keep agro with 2 1 hand weapons or a 2 hand weapon?

-So far ive gotten a Blackened Acrylia Blade in my main hand and a
Wakizashi of the frozen skies in my off hand.  Are these good weapons
for holding agro?  Ive read I should be using a weapon that stuns to
hold agro but none of the posts gave a name of a weapon. Any
suggestions?

-Ive been told that turning a mob so its back is to the casters is a
good thing but wasnt told why. Can anyone tell me more about this?

Anything else I should know to be a good MT would be usefull as well,
keep in mind I dont know all the abbreviation so please fill me in, in
full detail.
