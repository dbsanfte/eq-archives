Not at all. However, it's one thing to talk about Wicca based solely
on what you've read on a web site. It's quite another to discuss it
based on actually being a member of the religion.

Sorry, maybe I'm missing something, but looking over that page and its
links, I see a discussion of a particular tradition of Wicca, but
nothing about the role of the Tetragrammaton in it. Not even a mention
of the Kabbalah.

>And this;
>http://www.christianwicca.com/goddess.html

I'm not one of those folks who runs around telling others that no,
they're not part of such-and-such religion, so I'll refrain from
mentioning my first thought. But I'd bet my lunch money that the
overwhelming majority of Christians would tell the "Christian Wiccan"
that they are not, in fact, Christian.

Most of that page sounds to me like the desperate twisting of someone
who wants to play at being Wiccan but is afraid of being un-Christian.

>>The Tetragrammaton has no meaning to the Wiccan *religion*.

>Then why do all these websites contradict your

Because you're reading them wrong. Or applying completely the wrong
significance to what you're seeing.

Symbology does not equal doctrine.
