Obviously I disagree. Many games with multiple expansions let the 
expansions build off eachother. Sure you don't *need* them all... and 
I'm not saying EQ should *require* them... but its not unreasonable that 
the 'best' of the 'best' items in the game would involve quests going 
throughout the entire known world.

Your telling me SOE would have a problem with this?? Plus It would 
probably simplify their programming efforts if they didnt have to always 
worry about people missing Kunark, or Luclin...

Why?

Considering they are currently set to sell Everquest Evolutions 
including the original game and all 5 expansions up to LDoN for 
virtually the same price as LDoN, including a free month.

So after you factor out the free month... the game + 5 expansions is ... 
$17.00. Knock out the box, manuals, maps, shipping and other crap, and 
your sitting around 10-12.00 tops of profit on the Evolutions box...  I 
don't think there would be a "huge uproar" if they offered players a 
download catchup expansion including anything they don't have from 
Kunark to Ykesha for 10 bucks, especially if that enabled them to do far 
more in the game...I don't think people would get that bent out of shape.

I know I wouldn't.
