Hi All,

I know this has been touched on before(and I had a look/search with my
scungy MSOE), but I was wondering whether necros can research other classes
spells.
It's a given that the necro will not be able to use the spell, but are they
precluded from combining?

Does this have the potential to word for words and runes?

What about the faded writings and writs?


TIA =)
