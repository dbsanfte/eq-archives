Four to five hours (if thatm - more like a couple or three probably) maybe 
once a week (if that) sounds reasonable. Why the hell are you in a guild in 
the first place if this idea seems so alien to you?

"Well, I'm gonna get flagged and then please understand that I can't be 
bothered to help the rest of you because that just wouldn't be *any* fun 
for me. No, I get no joy from helping the rest of you blokes."
