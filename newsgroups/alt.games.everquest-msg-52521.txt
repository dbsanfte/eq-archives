but its Verant's best attempt to easily shrug us off, they dont have time to
research for us, they have to please the majority of the playerbase. *cough*
That is why I avoid trading.. I never lost an item yet. well, except for my
light burlap sack... but that damn merchant stole it from me, I swear!! =P

Oh, and I also think its a stupid thing to do on their side. If they really
do have logs on trade then maybe they should start putting them to better
use and also logging when items are dropped on the ground and when trade is
initiated if that isnt already. They said before that they had no proof
wether the item was really lost or if the item was dropped and picked up,
which they couldnt detect. Their policies have turned into BS over the years
Well this post is umm full of random thoughts and I should go to bed now....
cant... think...
