Sorry, perhaps I should have included 'IMHO' (but pretty much felt that if I 
was saying it, it would be considered IMHO). It's my truth, how about that? 
*smile* Someone else may disagree, but for me, I can select between several 
different faces that look totally different from each other, not to mention 
about a dozen (didn't count them, so could be wrong on the number) totally 
different hairstyles (probably varies by race). I didn't play the Beta, so I 
can't speak of before its release; in fact, I can't speak for the game at 
all before Thursday, Jan. 27. :) I can only give my impressions on the game 
from that point on, which are that I'm far more impressed by the 
customizability with WoW than I am with that of EQ2. So if my new claim is 
wrong, it's not wrong for me. :)

See above about hairstyles. There are a wide variety (or at least I think 
so) of hairstyles for each race, including some radical punk styles for 
trolls, undead, and dwarves (at least).
