Just a quick spelling lesson...I don't normally say anything 'cause in-game
I assume people are typoing.

"poped" is the past tense of "pope..." a word I'm pretty sure doesn't exist.

If a word ends in a consonant it's a pretty safe bet that you're supposed to
add another of the same letter before adding the "ed."

popped
popping
dying (not dieing)
giving (not giveing)

And lots of people think that "opps" is the correct spelling of "oops."  I
still don't understand that mistake.  I mean, I used to think it was just a
typo...after all, the "o" and "p" are right next to each other.  But I see
is correctly spelled MAYBE 1/10th of the time (more likely 1/20th).

ANYWAY, to get back on topic, anyone sitting near a spawn will almost always
be hit first.

Sorry for the mini-rant, it wasn't directed at you...I'm assuming you just
typoed. ;)
