I don't believe being on hate lists has any effect at all.  If it did,
you'd be unable to med from when as you healed your tank until the mob
was dead.

Tested it yesterday: the good news is that you still appear to meditate
while casting.  As a cleric who casts CH, MoK (from BP) & Word of
Health (from Greaves) - 10, 10, 12 second casts -  this is great news.

It's the hybrids who really suffer from this change, no more meditating
while in combat.

Now to lame spells: Mark of Retribution.  Cast this on a mob, and
whenever it hits someone there's perhaps a 10% chance that it takes
about 15% of the damage it did in that hit.  I can see this being
possibly useful for very long fights against mobs who hit for 400+, but
for regular XP group usage, it looks like a waste of mana.  A bit more
testing is in order though.
