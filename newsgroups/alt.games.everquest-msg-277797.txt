I noted a couple of years back that as long as you hit 100 Charisma,
that seems to do about as well as any higher Charisma stat.  I can get
to about 150 or 160 with my fairly lowbie Enchanter, and the extra 50
or 60 make no difference, if I recall correctly.  Either that, or
maybe a few silver better.
