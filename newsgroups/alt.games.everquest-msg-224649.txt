If the other five were 53/53/53/53/50, then you would have gotten a
level 55 dungeon, as the average level of your group was 53 exactly.
If any of the 53s were lower, your average would be below 53 and you 
should have gotten a level 50 dungeon. Sounds like you got the level 
55 dungeon.

That's how the dungeon level selection used to work, anyway. Maybe
they messed with it somehow in the last patch.
