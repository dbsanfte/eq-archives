You're reading skills are truly abysmal.  I never said that lower
level mobs didn't green out as you advanced (duh it's only been 
that way for 5 1/2 years).  Read my post again -- it doesn't matter
that the level 43 mobs that are DB at 58 are green at 60.  A level
65 gains so much ability that they can easily kill level 50 mobs
instead.  Not only that, they can group against much higher level
mobs and take advantage of the High Con Bonus.

Proving again how poorly you read and comprehend.  If you'd actually
attempted to read down that column you'd see an entry called:

Patch History.  Suppose you'd find a history of patches there?
