As I recall, yes, you will become KOS to the Kunark factioned dragons (Ring 
of Scale I think).  They do not have zonewide aggro, but, don't get very 
close.  There is also one dragon in Western Wastes on the same faction I 
believe.  I don't think it's just wyverns and wurms either, but pretty much 
anything in the zone.
