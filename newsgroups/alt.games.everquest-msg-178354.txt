Well, in the same spirit, I won't let Komarov, Dobrovolski, Volkov and 
Patsayev go unmentioned.

I would wager that 99 percent of the structural stress on vehicles 
happens on takeoff and landing. Most atmospheric aircraft disasters (
barring terrorism) happen also during takeoff and landing. Once you are 
in orbit, it's not often that something will kill you fast enough not to 
give you time to do something about it. The Russians never lost anyone 
in space either, and they have dozens --if not hundreds-- of times as 
many accrued man-hours in space as NASA does.

Let's hope Congress bears that very much in mind.
