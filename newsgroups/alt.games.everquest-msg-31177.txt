Been there, done that.

I've programmed computers to play various games -- Chess, Checkers,
Othello, the "amoeba" game from The 7th Guest, Scrabble,
and even Freecell, among others.  (As an aside, NEVER play
Scrabble against a computer; you will lose, horribly.)

What's really unnerving about them is the way they'll leave
"good" moves unplayed if they can get around to playing them
later.

Humans will jump on a good move as soon as it "opens up"
for them, for fear of having the "door" closed on them
before they play it.  But a computer that sees N moves
ahead can see that if you can't stop it from making that
move over the next N moves, there's no need to play it
immediately.  So it'll usually leave it alone and go
develop some other part of the board.

This can be maddening as you play against it, because
often it'll end up with 3 or 4 unplayed moves all
over the board, which you can't do anything about.  The
moment you make a move in order to reach a point
where you can block one of its good moves, *bang*,
*then* it suddenly makes the move a moment before
you reach the point where you could actually do
anything about it.

Watching the Freecell program play is bizarre as well.
A human Freecell player will always preferentially
make the move that puts more cards onto a neat stack,
and/or keeps the four "free" cells free.  The computer
program usually keeps all 4 free cells full unless it
absolutely needs them, and will leave partial stacks
scattered all over the board unconsolidated if it
doesn't *need* to pile them up.  It's.... alien.
