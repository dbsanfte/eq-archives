No, it isn't. 

Its not proof of anything other than you no longer
wish to live. It proves nothing regarding strength
or will. It may well indicate enormous strength of
character and will.

No, it doesn't. It may show all sorts of things,
not just the narrow range you put forward.

Of course you can, in fact you have just given a
rationalisation for it.

Its a simple question... if a game, any game
caused suicidal depression, should the makers be
held responsible?

A right thought?

Whats a right thought?

Why?

Because you don't like them?

What ones do you find particularly unintelligent?

Who decides what is a 'good decision', and what is
not.... you?.... me?  

What if we disagree?
