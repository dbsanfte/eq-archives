I've just bought a Toshiba Satellite Pro 6100 notebook PC with XP Pro
and an nVidia Geforce4 420GO video card. I have the mouse problems on
the character select screen. I've tried the solution on Sony's support
page to no avail. The solution seems to be aimed at Win98 systems
because XP doesn't manage drivers quite the same way.Although I'm
still finding my way around XP so there might be some way to
update/refresh the mouse driver.

I'll try jiggling the mouse as I move from the server select screen to
the character select screen.
