Sorry I drop in, this whole thread is really paranoid, but I really do
believe you got the point:

Totally agree.

Uh? Not having military bases over the world, not giving unilateral support
to factions in war, not exploiting natural resources of underdeveloped
countries giving nothing in reward but strangling interest rates for some
badly distributed goods, contributing to other counties' development, not
being worlds air polluter n� 1 etc, etc ... that all has nothing to do with
isolationism, i believe :)

Note that I deliberatley did not mention "Not being the only developed
country applying death penalties". What you are doing with your own people
is really a shame, but that alone would have motivated nobody to bomb you.

You americans really don't agree with mr Bush's claims ("US is the Light of
Democracy?"), do you? From here in Europe, US does not even have the look of
a democratic country, no matter what our leaders talk in official acts, do
not get them wrong.

(peace & love to all of you)
