You mean I can't feed my addiction today?  Dear God!

Why me?  I have only one day off in the next six months and they schedule a
patch just to annoy me.  They must have been speaking with my boss to get my
schedule.  Well, it's not going to work.  I'm not paying SOE any longer.
I'm selling my accounts and plat and playing on a free server.  Hah!  That
will show you.  You can't rule my life any longer.  I win.

Just because you think everyone is out to get you does not mean that they
are not.
