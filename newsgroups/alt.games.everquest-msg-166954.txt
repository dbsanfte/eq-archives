There is a skeleton/gorrilla hut in Burning Wood just due East of the
Giant fort that has approximately 6 mobs there at all times. As a
druid I have been quad kiting them from 49 till about 52 or 53 when
they start to get to be light blue, then I switched over to AAxp, and
have gotten like 5 points there in the last few weeks. The skeles can
always be single pulled, the gorrillas sometimes are not as nice (at
least since recent patch, have not had an add in ages). There are
rarely ever any wandering mobs in the area between the hut and the
Giant fort, except if perhaps someone at the Giant Fort Fears a giant
over to there. Also the hornets there are great especially the Scoriae
ones. The following drop spells in Burn Wood -- Tatterback Gorrillas,
Sarnak Avengers, Forest Giant Ancients, Greater War Boned Skeles,
Scoriae Hornets, and the occasional Wurm/named Wurm. I have gotten a
few Druid, Necro, Cleric, Enchanter, and Paladin spells there. Even at
level 56 these mobs are dark blue, and well worth the chase.

If you work weird hours you can also do the Giant Fort, but that tends
to be overhunted to the max. I would avoid Gullerback if you are going
solo, as he is toally immune to snare/root, and not sure a necro pet
would last against him till the later 50's perhaps (if then). Also
avoid 2 of the 5 named wurms there
Nezekezena and Phurzikon if soloing as they summon and also debuff
you, the other 3 wurms are not as nasty (Azdalin, Gylton, and
Entalon), but still you may not be ready for them till later levels.

The Sarnak Zealots are what I usually avoid like the plague, and
rightfully so they have some nasty spells and will DoT you down in
health in seconds. Hope this helps in your hunting....
