God, I hope you spelled it right when you created it...noooo, you didn't.  I
just went to your website (website looks good though...looks like you either
generally know how to spell or you used the spell-check button <always a
good idea>).

What does your guild name MEAN?  It makes absolutely NO sense to me, and
nowhere on your website does it explain the very odd name.  Did the creator
make it because it just sounded "cool," or was there ANY thinking done
behind the name?

There's so many inane names in EQ.  Anything with "phoenix" is stupid
because (as far as I know) there is no phoenix mythology in Norrath.  The
Rathe's biggest, and most filled with assholes uberguild is (or was...I
don't know for sure what they're called now, I escaped) Brotherhood of the
Spider.  What spider?  Do they refuse to kill any spiders in the game or
just "the" unnamed spider?  I believe they're called Blood of the Spider
now.  Oh great, sounds like they went from revering spiders to believers in
arachnocide (sp).

There's so many guilds out there that I just want to take the guild creator,
slap him in the face while saying "What *slap* were *slap* you *slap*
THINKING?"
