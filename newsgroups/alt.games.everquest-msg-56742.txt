Sorry, no you don't. As long as there are mobs that have a level range (as
almost every mob does) then you will have some that are green and give XP
and some that look EXACTLY the same and will not give XP. This fixed this
annoying problem.  Although I do agree with you that there are SOME (few)
mobs that are always the same level and therefore you know that they JUST
became green and therefore you will get xp.
