Well, that may be viable now, but I would think it would make more
sense to just keep leveling and hope you can drop scalekeeper or
Talendor for red scale and Gorenaire for white scale.  Levels make
such a difference, that I just can't see why anyone would stay at
level 52.  Especially as a warrior, since the green scale is the real
bottleneck, and if you can drop Sev, you can drop Talendor or the
scalekeeper.
I personally am not going to turn on my alt exp until I ding 60.  Of
course I also didn't really have a choice to stay at 52, especially
since my guild was starting to get very strict about 55 being the
minimum level.
