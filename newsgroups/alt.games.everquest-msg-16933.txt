Your examples are _useful_ shortenings of terms. You don't go around 
typing Small Computer Systems Interface because it's too long. You 
describe an engine's output at "45 horses" rather than phrasing the odd 
sentence of "My engine has a horsepower rating of 45." Saying "shammy" 
or "chanter" doesn't seem to serve any purpose other than looking 
different or cute. 

Maybe that's what it is? Trying to convey a sense of, "Hey, I've been 
around for a while"

I dunno, it just annoys me. Call me weird for judging someone for saying 
one of the above rather than the full class or race, but that's how it 
is.

Ebonics annoy me too, I might add.
