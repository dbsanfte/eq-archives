I sort of know what you are going through, I have had gall stones, but you 
don't pass those, I had to get cut open and have my gall bladder removed.  I 
still get pain there sometimes but it passes after an hour or so. Very 
painful, the one and only time I ever thought about suicide, and yes, it 
hurt that badly.  I went through it for 3 months, the stupid doctors kept 
saying it was gas and then it was an ulcer and finally they did an ultra 
sound and found out it was gall stones.
