He says nothing about fixing the people who paid $149 back to $99, or 
reimbursing anyone.

Sony just doesn't care to support their customers or honor their own 
contracts.  All they have to do is credit customers accounts and offer 
this deal again to everyone.  But no, they have to pretend they are 
tracking something down and lie to their own customers. (as if their is 
something to track down, when the problem lies with Sony themselves 
refusing to honor their own contract).

He even posted that message in a "NEWBIE" message board, to the very 
people who don't even have this deal. 

Here is a link of what is actually happening for most people... nothing.
