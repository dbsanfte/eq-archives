Well, since this is an open access forum, no particular fee or 
membership to belong, think of it as being like a lawn party somewhere.

You wander in and pull a lager out of your pocket, pop it and start 
swilling. Some idiot wanders up carrying a guiness stout[or a dark beer 
of your choice.] he then makes a complete ass of himself jumping up and 
down [after carefully putting the booze on the ground so he oesnt commit 
alcohol abuse by spilling it...] screaming pointing at you and demanding 
you get rid of that totally incorrect beer, that nobody at a different 
set of lawn parties objected to. Would you be inclined to drop the lager 
or tell him to sod off?

Same thing. I deeply resent being screamed at, pointed at, and have a 
baby jumping up and down holding their breath until they turn blue 
telling me I have to do anything. I have always responded well to a 
polite 'Excuse me, but we do prefer bottom or interspersed posting in 
this newsgroup. would you mind changing to do so?' Well, I will actually 
confess nobody in any other newsgroup I am in bothers me or anybody else 
about top posting, so it isn't entirely correct...but I will respond to 
a polite request.

I am not getting back at someone, or anyone in particular. Heck, I dont 
actually bother killfiling anybody. If there I a thread I dont want to 
read, I stop reading it. If someone degenerates into a puling fool, I 
will click past their post. I don't let my nieces/nephews/goddaughters 
tantrums change my actions, I am simply *not* going to accede to the 
screamings, jumpings up and down and general carryings on of juveniles 
to change my posting. I would pay attention to someone gently pointing 
out the general posting method of a group, and asking me if i would not 
mind changing to accomodate.
