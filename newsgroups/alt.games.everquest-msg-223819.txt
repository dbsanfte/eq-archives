You'd never hard code tax rates.  Period. 

Additionally, a once a year change to a mission critical piece of software
will get a full testing regimen.  The extra cost is vastly lower than the
liability of having it blow up.

In fact, if it's a critical enough system, you run the new version in
parallel with the old one and verify that it generates the exact same
output.

Or, in the case of a credit authorization system I once rewrote - it 
doesn't produce the same output.  Extensive analysis on my part, the
account senior programmer and anyone else we could rope in finally 
verified that my output was correct - the system they'd been using
was not working to spec. The original system may have worked correctly,
but it had undergone change upon change, modification upon modification,
in the years before I (or my boss) layed eyes on it.

Bugs get sorted by a couple of criteria -

Severity (your check example is obviously as critical as it gets) and
difficulty to fix.

Bugs that can wreck the server economy (epics dropping from newbie mobs -
or the classic orc pawns who dropped 1k pp each once) need to get fixed in
a hurry.  ALL of us suffer when the economy gets wrecked (ask people from
Xev).

Bugs like the mage pets going rogue are serious - but far harder to find
because they are intermittent.  You must be able to reliably reproduce a 
bug to fix it - anything else is just throwing code against the wall and
hoping it sticks.

Additionally you have to remember that fixing one bug can create others -
for every ten lines of code you write you'll produce 3 bugs (IIRC the
numbers correctly).

If writing solid code were a paint by numbers excercise everyone would do
it.

Actually, they leave many exploits in game for a very long time - despite
knowing about them.  The reason is that they require too many man hours to
justify the benefits - so they warn people not to use them and carry on 
with bugs they can fix.

A classic example?  Frenzied burnout.  It's a PoS worthless AA that mages
get - at least it was worthless until we got CoTAM.  It seems that if you
FB'd a charmed pet, it lasted forever instead of the 36second duration it
was intended to.  This bug has been around since PoP came out, and 
discussed in threads that Scott Hartsman, Rich Waters or Alan Vancouvering
participated in.  They even said it was unintentional and a semi-exploit,
but that they couldn't/wouldn't do anything about people using it.  A few
patches ago they finally fixed it so it wore off.  

Why did it take them so long to fix?  An educated guess says that

1.  It didn't provide *that* much of an advantage (heck - charmed pets are
already deadly when they break, this just makes it riskier)
2.  The time necessary to fix it and ensure they didn't introduce other 
bugs could better be spent on something that affected a larger number of
people.

If I were running things - I would definitely take down the servers to fix
a drop-table bug that could wreck the entire economy across all servers,
but I'd leave the fix for the rogue pets (that affected very few people
only occasionally) for the next patch.

The live team has a budget for creating new features and fixing bugs.  It's
finite, and they have to balance all the items on their todo list inside
this budget.  Do I think they could do better?  Yes.  Introducing a change
just before code goes live is assinine and a guaranteed way to introduce
bugs.  If something in the patch needs that change to be balanced - then 
hold that feature back to the next patch.  However, I don't think they are
incompetent - EQ runs too smoothly for an incredibly complicated system
that has undergone change after change, update after update, for them to
be totally clueless.
