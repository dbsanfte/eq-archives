AHHH! There's the rub.  pre-PoP i was using my laptop at a friend's 
house, and had to have my particle setting set as low as I could so that 
the machine wouldn't be over taxed at an inopportune moment.  By the time 
that I had quit using the laptop (and quit going over to my freind's 
house to play), PoP was pretty much the way to travel.

Guess that's why I don't remember seeing anyone using the spires
