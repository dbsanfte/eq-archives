Several months ago, Verant added new "ultimate" (or at least "really
good") weapons for each class, and invented new "epic" (i.e.,
really long, involved, and hard) quests to obtain them.

Previously, only Paladins had had a special weapon resulting
from an "epic"-sized quest (the Fiery Avenger).  That's why these
are also sometimes called (even by Verant) FA-type weapons/quests..

But at the same time other classes got "epic" weapons/quests,
Paladins got a new one as well (the Fiery Defender), since the
Fiery Avenger was starting to look a bit wimpy compared to 
other high-end weapons that had been added to the game 
since the FA had been implemented.

You can see info on them here:
