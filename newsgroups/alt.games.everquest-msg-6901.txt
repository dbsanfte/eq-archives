Since you are presumably bound in the zone, and ought to be
dying fairly regularly anyway, not a big deal.  Put them on a
humanoid, and the graphic should show it as a weapon; yes,
it will be harder to kill, but well worth the effort.  Perhaps team up
with some others your level to go take him down!

Putting the things on non weapon critters would be the rough
equivalent of giving the stuff away... not that there is anything
wrong with that, but it depends on what the person "donating"
the weapons had in mind.  I prefer to think that the person
getting it had to work for it.
