Bah.  You had an unpleasant run in with one of the utter assholes (or
two) that inhabit the game.  Kinda like life.  Shrug it off or stop
playing, your choice.

The GM was perfectly fair, though.  Verant has announced the rule, that
camps cannot be owned, which is what you were trying to do.  It is for
sure not perfect but it's not that bad in the long run.
