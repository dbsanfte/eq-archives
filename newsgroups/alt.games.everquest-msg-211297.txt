For cash farming, you'd be able to do well in Shadeweavers Thicket. It
is a VahShir newbie zone - take the PoK book there and run north to
the mouth of the tunnel entrance to Paludal Caverns. Around the tunnel
entrance and up on the zone wall are the spawn points of about a dozen
Lesser Shades and Skeletal Hunters. Kill all of them, they have
50-150hps and seem to respawn faster the more quickly you can kill
them (to a point). The Hunters have no drops of value (except
bonechips) but share the spawn table with the lesser shades. They do
not run, do not cast and do not aggro.

The Lesser shades have about a 50% chance of having 1-5 loot items -
the ones you are interested in are Shadeling Silk and especially
Swirling Shadows. Shadeling silk sells for 20pp a stack in the bazaar
(40pp per stack of shade silk thread if you combine it). The Swirling
shadows are for high level smithing and sell very fast at 50pp EACH
(1000pp a stack). In 1 hour of running about, I have been able to kill
enough for 20 Swirling shadows and 6-8 stacks of shadeling silk - it
soon adds up.

Get a 1hb with the lowest possible delay you can find, even if it is
crappy damage. You need to swing fast, fast, fast.

Solo : May I recommend the zoneline from Gunthak/Dulak where all the
Scouts are. They will just be dark blue to you at 55, but hit quite
hard and fast, and have enough loot to pay your buff and potion costs.
Bind yourself at the lighthouse, buy about 6 invis potions off Mr
Geerlok and get to the Dulak zone. *Fully* melee buff yourself. I
recommend Temperance and a c3 (it will pay for itself, don't worry),
Blessings of Faith, Mark of Retribution. Have root, stun, fear,
PetHammer, CelHeal and Retribution memmed. Zone through to Dulak and
pull a scout with MoR. Tab to yourself and try to get CelHeal up
without being interrupted. MoR will do most of your damage. Now just
Yaulp and hit and bash. Replace CelHeal as it drops, get your pet up
and clobber away. They will walk away at 20, so root and finish with a
nuke. If it goes badly, zone through to gunthak. Once you get the 56
spells, use your proccing hammer and yaulp5. Drop the Shivs, they are
worthless.

Or : Find a group in PoNightmare (treant alley or ravens or south
waterfall) who are full and ask if you can practice 1hb. Tell them you
will not loot and will not take aggro. Fully buff yourself, have
immobilise, fear and stun memmed. Wait for them to pull and get the
mob to about 90% then clobber and bash away. Do not stun as this will
build too much aggro. If you *get* aggro from an add, immobilise or
fear it and zone immediately. In fact bind yourself in PoT and gate to
bind. Higher cons usually mean faster skillups.

Grouped : get in a group with a backup healer and clobber away. Don't
stun, just hit. Low delay and shaman/chanter haste is your friend.

Not tried this, so can't comment...
