Mages are about DPS.  95% of what I do in an XP group is DPS.  Any
utility is done at the beginning of a session.  Now they are directly
reducing that DPS (which was just barely in line prior to the change.)

Now I get to wait what, a year for them to fix it?  Longer?  That's
how long monks have waited.  Maybe I only have to wait 2 months and
spend $30 to be rebalanced.
