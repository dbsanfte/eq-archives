Yup.. these guys are around all the time. The funny part is how many
people actually swallow it. It was called a Story for a reason and he
was selling it that way.. complete with embellished details and a sob
story about how he was banned from EQ 3 times and whatever.

The #1 rule is if the evidence consists completely of his story.. its
usually an attempt to sell you something. In this case, he wants to
sell you the idea that he got somewhere he wasn't supposed to. The
catch is always in the proof. The 'proof' he posits is his buddies
'claiming' that they saw him down Sontalak. Did they? Who knows..
maybe he found a bug that could kill it.. more likely they're just
sharing in on the lie to make themselves look better along with him.

In a lot of ways.. it is a well constructed story too, but still weak
at points. i applaud him on his abilities. He doesn't go over-the-top
and say he got all AA.. just 350 or so. The killer though is the one
thing he will never answer and address which -martin hit on right
off... so, sport.. you were in the zones.. wru screenshots? Instead of
those he just gives 'details' that are probably available from
database/client information... names of zones... names of mobs in a
zone.. effects that he saw in the database that he put a story too.
Its clever stuff. Some people love storytellers that can really run
with information you can't conceive of them having.. but is
available... but for me he's just a turd wanting to be loved and lying
in a convincing way to make you think he is more than he is...
probably that snotbag KS'r you knew from game that you got banned 3
times.

And I could SWEAR I saw someone on that grassy knoll sir.. HE WAS
RIGHT THERE.. SNIPER RIFLE AND EVERYTHING.

People lie.. and if not he was cleverly duped. All the 'proof' that
was needed was screenshots.. and he couldn't produce them, end of
story.

No its not. Its hearsay. You heard someone say something, if you want
to believe your friend carte-blanche, then you are as naive as the old
lady who just thinks the mine she bought a part of really does have
gold in it. He's a salesman and you're his mark.

>And if you could insta-kill any mob

Sure.. if you could.

And fly like Superman... might as well call him Neo. I also don't
believe the 'warp' bit.

True.. and its not really credible.

They always do.

That means there aint a chance in hell he's 'really' going to try to
prove himself, and as such.. he's just sellin ya a story.

I take it you bought?

As per his later claim that he should 'put all that he knows about the
game and tie them up for months'? HAHAHAHAHAAHAAHHAHAAHAHAAHA.

Armed with accurate bug information.. it doesn't take programmers long
at all to lock the source and fix it if its high priority.. a day or
two and anything he had would be fixed and being sent out in a patch.
