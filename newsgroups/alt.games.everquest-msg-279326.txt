I run with an AMD XP 3200+, 1GB of dual channel PC3200 sram, and an ATi 
9800 Pro with 128MB.  Even in raids with just my spell effects on, I do 
not experience framerates that low.  I have never measured the framerate, 
but the only time I see unacceptably low framerates in EQ1 is when a zone 
is seriously overcrowded, ie two or three raids hitting the same zone at 
the same time.  When raiding, I look at the targets, I do not have to 
turn to face a wall, or look down at my feet.  If I turn on all spell 
effects for everyone, then framerates drop dramatically.

I run with Luclin models on for all races, 1280x1024 resolution, shadows 
turned off.
