Not at all.  I always run EQ right after a fresh boot.  The usual
system stuff is running and ZoneAlarm.  I do notice is happens hardly
ever if I shut the system down hard prior by powering off the power
strip.  If I do a normal restart it will most likely hangup (then I
get pissed, hit the strip,  Windows comes up and I log in fine).
