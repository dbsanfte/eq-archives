I don't know didly about beastlords, but one of our guild's BL's is
working on his epic and requested help killing some of the "spirits"
that are apparently required to finish it.

So, I dutifully rounded up the troops the other day and off we went to
SoNH where his trigger mob was up. Soon we were facing a giant alligator
in the bottom of a slimey pool named "The Spirit of Sorrow".

This freaking thing is permarooted in the pool, apparently, and
continually casts an AoE "Death Roll" that spins you around, stuns you,
and does some damage. He can also summon.

He seemed to defy all conventions because you could *not* cast nuked on
him from underwater next to him. You could, however, cast on him from by
the shoreline. It was as if he wasn't in the water at all. But even
pouring 8 Ice comets in a row into him for nearly 10K in damage, I had
barely budged his health bar when he summoned me. The raid wiped,
needless to say.  This bastard either has a mountain of HP beyond belief
for a mob of his level, (was blue to me) or has regen to make Cazel
jealous.

Anyone have any experience and/or tips on this slimy bastage? I hate to
see the beastlords whine about being the only class not gettin epics in
our guild and frankly I'm not coming up with a lot of intelligent
theories on how to take him down.

Do you suppose heavy disease dots can shut his regen off? (Assuming
that's what it is.) Someplace to hide behind structure from his AoE?
Some resists for the melee to work on so their not just stunned to death
and/or drown if they don't have an EB item on?
