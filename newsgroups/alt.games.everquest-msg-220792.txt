Yes, I suppose that's true, not that I've ever been in a group that
efficient.

The way it usuallly works is that when it's time to break mez, I stand up,
move near the mob that's waking up next (Regardless of how it affects my
position on the hate list (and I'm not certain that it does at all when I'm
not actively adding to hate via spells), I don't want the mob running from
the melees to me the instant mez breaks), let the tank taunt until mez
expires or the tanks attacks, and poise my finger over my eldritch rune
hotkey and take whatever happens.  I can't remember the last time I died on
an intentionally awakened mob, when I and everyone in the group is ready to
deal with it.  The dangerous time is past- the mob is tashed, slowed, and
otherwise debuffed, and in that state I can tank  pretty much everything I
can mez, though sometimes at a high mana cost.  In those groups with no
taunter (rare, but it happens), sometimes I end up tanking through 90
percent of the fight.

On a not-too-related note, I've seen caster agro work a little strangely at
times. Particularly on shaman mobs, I've seen them turn to me and cast
(usually malo-) without me doing anything to have moved myself  to the top
of the hate list.  They'll usually then turn back to the person who should
be the top of the list.  Weird.  Of course shaman mobs will also sometimes
turn in the middle of combat and dispell mez on another mob, which I really,
really hate. They must have interesting AI.
