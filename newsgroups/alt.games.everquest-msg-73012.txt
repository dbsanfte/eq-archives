Ok, before the December 25th patch, I had no problems (well, at least no
technical problems) with EQ.  Now, after the patch, whenever I try to purchase
some small ore from the supply sargeant in Shir Var, I drop to the desktop after
clicking done on the purchase selection dialog.  I've tried both stock XP
drivers and the updated ones from ATI, same problem.

My system stats:

p3 800 w/ 392mb ram
ATI Radeon 64mb DDR VIVO
running XP Pro

Anyone else with this same problem?  Any ideas how to fix it?  I cannot complete
my warrior quest if I can't purchase the ore.
