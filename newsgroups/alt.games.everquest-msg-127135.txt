Have the guildee see if a friend can load it on another computer. Need to
make sure that person is trustworthy.

I know of one person who couldn't load in a certain zone. Cant remember the
zone but I know he was able to play all his other ppl fine. He solved it by
have a friend log on and move his person that he couldn't load.
