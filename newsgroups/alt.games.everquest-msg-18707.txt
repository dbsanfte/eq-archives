The BOLS is part of the same quest series.  The Concordinance of Research is
used to learn research without wasting components.  The BOLS is a component
in one of the research quests to develop more research skill.

Personally I find these quests are a bit of a pain in the anatomy.  Every
one has at least one component that is a pain to get, if not more.  But,
they are better than wasting your research components.  I have already
burned four sets of the components for Tepid Deeds.  I have succeeded with
every other spell of that level, but always fail on that one.  So I am going
to work up some research and see what happens.
