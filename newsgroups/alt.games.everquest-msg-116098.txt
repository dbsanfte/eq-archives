You were making sense until you brought up Linux.

Linux is licensed under the General Public License (GPL).  The GPL
was invented to kill commercial software.  The misguided folks at
the Free Software Foundation decided commercial software was immoral
and unethical and the weapon they created to destroy commercial
software is the GPL.

Every time someone writes something and licenses it under the GPL,
or extends something under the GPL, or uses something that is
licensed under the GPL, they are furthering the FSF's goal of
killing commercial software.

I don't know about you, but I don't trust an entity, or a license,
or even a kernel that uses a license, that tries to take the
option of commercial software away from me.  I don't trust someone
who tells me I'm unethical for writing software and not giving
away the source with it.

The GPL is just a bad idea.  Bad.  Bad bad bad.  And to expect
companies to throw money behind something that cannibalizes their
intellectual property is just insane.

The BSD license is much more reasonable.  *True* competitors to
Windows could exist if companies would wake the hell up from all
this Linux spam/evangelism/hype and realize the base from which
they should build is BSD.  Developers who feel like "making the
world a better place" should license their code under BSD instead
of GPL because it'll encourage REAL competition.  Not this drug
induced GPL "let's all hold hands and get along" communist pipe
dream.

But I guess there will always be those who believe you can build
a business model from giving your software away for free and...
uh...selling t-shirts and mugs.  I guess.
