Agreed.  Early in each level have the druid buff the poo out of the
cleric with Skin and DS, get some haste and assorted other buffs from
rest of the crew and let that cleric melee.  Once Defense (at minimum,
if not off and weapon skill as well) is maxed for the level then use
Mr. Day's idea for the rest of the level.
