Exactly WHAT part of 'spawns independent of the turn in' don't you
guys complaining that merchant Zordak spawns dragon Zordak understand?

Cleric needs to hand in pearl to the merchant to get it transformed
after doing all the preceding steps. This does NOT trigger Zordak II.
Zordak II dragon spawns on his own, is killed, Zordak the dragon
spawns and drops the container for the swirling pearl. 

The bottleneck is still there, but no more need to kill Naggy and/or
clear fire giants, and no risk of losing everything if the dragon
killing goes wrong.
