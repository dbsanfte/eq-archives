It's also a highly contested spawn (at least on our server). You've got
a better chance at a lot of the warrior epic mobs, (yes, even Sev) than
you do at seeing Vaniki living longer than a fruit fly. Plus, that's
still only one weapon and only marginally better than one of the two
War. Epic weapons. The other one is still used in the off hand by many
warrior, even after they start getting Ubah.

Nothing wrong with the warrior epic. We've re-hashed this conversation a
million times, and Martin loves to bash the epic, but keep in mind that
he's in the top server on his guild. Weapons that 95% of your server
will never be able to dream of seeing are available to him. The epic...
it's a cool goal to strive for, particularly in less than top level
guilds, and if you get it someday it's something to be proud of and
still a damned fine pair of weapons with good taunt.
