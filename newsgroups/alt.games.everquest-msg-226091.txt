    The dev thinking at the time must have been to have them coming into the
game at the same rate as the actual spells they created. Given how stupidly
rare those spells were, that doesn't exactly increase the number around for
sale by much. Now that level 65 spells exist and the 51-60 spells aren't as
powerful/desired, they can release more into circulation and so they were
put on the LDoN drop tables.
