I've been trying to think of ways to help ameliorate this problem,
without upping the rates at which quest items enter the game.
Here's what I've come up with so far -- it's not perfect, but it
might help:

   Make high-end quest mobs triggerable instead of long-spawn.
   But make the odds of loot dropping be directly proportional
   to how long it was since the last trigger.

Example:  Dragon X used to spawn once a week and dropped
the Uber Item of Questing half the time (50% drop rate).

Now you can trigger him any time you want to, but if people 
trigger him once a day, he'll have only a 50/7 = 7.1%
chance of dropping the quest item.

If some guild decides to trigger him and kill him every
ten minutes for six hours, each kill will have only a
0.012% chance of dropping the item, or 0.45% chance of
dropping it at all during the six hours (which is the same
odds they would have had if they had just waited six hours
and *then* killed the dragon *once*).

So rapid-fire killings (by *anyone*) wouldn't be worth
the effort involved in killing the uber-mob.  You're
better off letting him "ripen" a while.

The triggering could also require a certain amount of
cash or a (PURCHASABLE!) expensive gem in order to
work the trigger, which would further make any attempts
to kill the mob too often wasteful and counterproductive.
(The trigger item would have to purchasable, or *easily*
questable, lest the trigger item itself become the next
bottleneck to be fought over).

Any guild attempting to monopolize the spawn would now have
to camp the spot 24/7 with a big enough group to gank the
mob whenever someone came in to spawn it, which could be
at *any* time -- how many guilds would want to waste this kind 
of manpower sitting on their butts *constantly*?

This would reduce the boring "sitting waiting for the mob
to respawn while we hold the spot" camp to nil.  Just bring 
enough people in to do the job, trigger the spawn, and 
have fun (trying to) kill it.

This technique "scales" nicely -- as more guilds become
able to do a contested mob on a server, their odds of
getting the item on any given kill drops to 1/N,
roughly, although a guild that has the manpower to visit
the spawn and trigger it twice as often as another will
get twice as big a slice of the drop rate, which is as
it should be.  Yet even the "can only kill the mob
once every few weeks" guilds have a (proportionally smaller)
shot at walking away with the goodies, *without* having
to fight the larger guilds for a chance at it.

Furthermore, rather than encourage fighting over a
spawn the instant it pops, as is the case currently,
the new system would encourage a game of "greed chicken",
whereby people would want to *wait* on triggering/killing
the mob, because the more time which has passed since
the last killing, the greater your odds of getting
the good loot, but this is counterbalanced by being
afraid that some other guild is going to reach their
own "can't wait any longer" time an hour before you do...

The end result would be, guilds aren't going to waste
their time killing the mob an hour after someone else has,
but it's in their own best interest (and every other guild's)
to bide their time for a while (novel concept), and then
attack whenever they have a force ready to do so.  It's
no longer an "all or nothing" spawn game -- every raid which
fights the mob gets a chance at the loot, without ruining
anyone else's chances for another week.

In fact, the optimum strategy for *all* guilds would be
to actually *cooperate*, and agree to respect each other's
chosen raid times -- those who jump the gun get *less*
loot than they would have if they had cooperated, thanks
to the "faster kills means less chance of a drop" mechanism.

Finally, there are no more PnP or KS "he said/she said"
issues -- PnP takes care of itself, and KS'ing is easy
to prove, since the people who trigger the mob own it,
period.

What do you think?
