Agreed. If you want to explore a lot, pick some other race, or plan on
making another character to explore most cities. I wouldn't recommend a
dark elf cleric for a new to Everquest player unless you are very hard
core. While faction can be raised for some areas, it's usually a long,
tedious chore, not fun for most people at all. Even with ok faction you
still run the risk of meeting some npc on an odd faction in those towns
who will want to kill you and when he attacks you, other npcs who
supposedly like you will assist him.

If it wasn't for the desire to explore everything, it'd be fine. If you
don't care about large parts of the old world it's quite easy to
completely avoid all faction issues by hunting on the moon or other
areas and banking/shopping in areas where faction is meaningless.

My ogre shaman has never been killed for faction reasons, but then he's
probably been in his home city less than a dozen times on his journey to
62, much less any other old world cities.
