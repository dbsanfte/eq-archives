Well, that gear probably has only a slightly higher pp value (today)
as my gear had (when I was 47).  Not having played a Monk I do have
a question:  Do you really have a 900 AC wearing that (including the
2 zero AC items listed)?

My Paladin (at 54 now) has an unbuffed AC just over 1050 with:
Primary:   Argent Protector
Ear1:      Earring of the Solstice
Ear2:      Shissar Eye Earring
Head:      Deepwater Helm
Face:      Death Mask of the Elysians
Neck:      Dragon Tooth Choker
Shoulder:  Imbued Granite Spaulders
Back:      White Bear Pelt Cloak
Arms:      Deepwater Vambraces
Wrist1:    Deepwater Bracer
Wrist2:    Deepwater Bracer
Hands:     Thunder Etched Gauntlets
Finger1:   Velium Fire Wedding Ring
Finger2:   Velium Fire Wedding Ring
Chest:     Barbed Ringmail
Waist:     Silvery Belt of Contention
Legs:      Barbed Ringmail Leggings
Feet:      Deepwater Boots

which drops a lot when I switch to resist gear:
Primary:   Sword of the Morning
Secondary: Sarnak Battle Shield
Ear2:      Electrum Blue Diamond Earring

Wrist1:    Velium Blue Diamond Bracelet
Wrist2:    Velium Blue Diamond Bracelet
Finger1:   Velium Diamond Ring
Finger2:   Velium Diamond Ring

The five Deepwater pieces are the only ones not upgraded since L47,

at which time I had no resist gear (and my haste item was my M2H).
So I can safely say that the bazaar has been very good to me, as
only about 20k or so of my upgrade budget came from loot I earned
(probably half of that from HGs).
