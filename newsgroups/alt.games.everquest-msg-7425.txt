Minor case of twinking, but don't worry, you have good equipment for your
level, but in a few more this will be about right, so its not a big deal.
Besides, anyone that yells that your a twink is just upset that you have
something better than them anyway.

I started an Enchanter, and before she was level 2 had all kinds of stuff
handed to her and did a favor for a high level and got 100pp.  I figured it
was my lucky day.  :)
