You can reproduce this in West Freeport when you have levitation on. Just
climb the roofs from lowers to highers ones then you can reach the top of
the city walls.
When you are on top of the city walls you can go past the zonelines and jump
down behind them.

I guess that could be exploited on PVP servers to ambush zoning players and
avoiding them to counter your attacks and hit you.
