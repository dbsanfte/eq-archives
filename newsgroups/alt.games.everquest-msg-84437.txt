Remember, bumblebees are scientifically proven to be unable to fly...

I guess we can't argue with someone who once got an article published in 
some magazine stating that according to his numbers, the Loch Ness 
monster cannot possibly exist. This doesn't mean I believe in the 
existence of the Loch Ness monster, far from that, it's just that I'm 
annoyed by scientists who don't understand that "explaining" is science, 
but "explaining away" is not.
