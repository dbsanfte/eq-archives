There is another really good quest involving bone chips in the Paladin
guild of Kaladim (home of the dwarfs), which is close by.  To get to
Kaladim, keep following the road from GF to Felwithe and keep going
west on the road till you zone into Butcherblock Mountains.  Once you
zone into Butcherblock Mountains, keep going west on the path till you
get to an area called "The Crossroads" (where there is a guard hut
with guards).  There the road splits off in two branches, one going
north and one south; you want to go north.  Keep following the path
till you reach the city of Kaladim.  The paladin guild is in North
Kaladim.  Go to Gunlok Jure and give him four bone chips.  You'll get
some money, a random item (a weapon or some patchwork armor), plus
experience.  (note:  you can get maps of various cities and zones from
http://www.eqatlas.com ).

Actually, while you're there you might just want to stay there in
Butcherblock Mountains and hunt for a while.  There are quite a few
mobs around the Crossroads area that would be around your level (level
7); when you get to about maybe level 10, you can then move over to
the Chessboard and fight. 

Hope that helps!
