The behemoth is a *hard* raid. its just insane to do a pickup raid with
level 55's on it on their first raid. Nutty ;)

Well, sure. But raiding can be fun. I would suggest trying to find
something much smaller scale with people you already know and like - if
you're playing to enjoy yourself and dont care about flags, who cares,
right? ;) 

See if you can go along on a nice traditional old world raid to get a
feel for how everythings hangs together. Maybe city of mist for
Jade Reavers, or if you're feeling adventurous the plane of hate. These
are quite challenging enough for your first raid experiences to be fun
without that total dispiriting anarchy of 'OMG what the hell just
happened?'

Biggest thing; go with folks who are going to have fun, who aren't
terribly snappy, and who already like you ;)

(oooh, or the hole, that can be fun too ;) )
