Up to level 20 a druid can do a reasonably useful job in melee. But
after that, yes, absolutely she should have been casting. SoW is nice,
but there should have been damage shields on the primary tank, basic
buffs on anyone likely to get smacked, maybe dots on the mob if the
fights were going long, and heals as needed if no better healer was
available.
