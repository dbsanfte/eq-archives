Brings up a question I've had for a while.  Back in the good old days, the
pinnacle of non-planer playing was down in Guk and LGuk.  So, basically,
end-game for that era was against froggies, who's idea was that????  I mean,
not orc or goblins, which would have made sense, or even gnolls, but
frogs??????
