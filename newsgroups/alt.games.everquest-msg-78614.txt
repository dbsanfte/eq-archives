They don't hit back, they riposte (sp?).  And they don't have that much 
for HP.  I decided to go out and cast on one (made sure the skill in 
that spell was maxed so no exploit for that could be pinned on me) and 
it's bar dropped a decent amount from a Boil Blood.  I believe that one 
does 400 or so damage?  Going to go try a few DD spells now just to see 
what happens.  Or more to see how much happens.
