As opposed to blogs discounting Lott? Or the HUNDREDS of webmasters
spending time calling Bush everything but a child of God? Face it...
Facts are facts. And you haven't argued a single fact on that site.
You try to dismiss it because you can't.

Oh, I completely understand it. I understand it's original meanings
(Which were actually pretty noble) and it's present day corruption.
It's been coopted by hoplophobes and socialists. Sad but true.

If that's your stance, then doesn't it make sense to allow LACs (Law

Dunno. When you stop treating Moore like someone to be listened to.
He's a hack, a liar, and an ass. His "documentary" that you hold up is
nothing more than a pack of lies with a liberal slant. He is a vile
man with communist leanings, and I personally find him so repugnant
that the fact that you even mentioned him puts you at a lower level of
humanity, in my book. 

I'm not calling hte guy Hitler, but as an example, I'd hold someone
who quoted Hitler and held up HIS beliefs at a lower level as well.
But Hitler's present day admirers (and yes, they're out there... I was
in Austria & Germany 3 years ago or so and it was a little disturbing)
are held at a lOT lwer level than you've achieved. So don't think I'm
pputting you in the same category. I'm not. That's just an example.

Yes, right in the middle of the Columbine shooting footage. Makes it
look like Heston is implicitly approving of those two wackjobs. Very
shady practice.

Ahhh... dramatic effect. The license of the liar. It was deceptive.
Period. it looked as if the timeline was concurrent. Of course it was
seperate footage. But it looked like it was happening at the same or
at a very close time. 

>
>Wow some FACT.

Yup. FACT. Moore altered a timeline to make Heston look like he
approved of the Columbine kids. That's pretty reprehensible.

Everything. Come on... bring it.

And how about the words he inserted into the campaign ad? The ones he
later edited?

I agree, which is why I'm aguring for people to get off their asses
learn to defend themselves properly, and start taking responsability
for themselves for once.

Then you should never have called it a documentary at all. When I read
your words, I understood you to call it a documentary that was shown
as a movie as opposed to one shown on TV.

Absolutely. Almost as bad as Arafat winning the Nobel peace prize!

As a whole I agree, but the oscars lend a credibility to a person who
