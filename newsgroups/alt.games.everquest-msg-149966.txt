Well, if she is capable of looking up the quest yet too dense to pick
up on the one huge detail about how to get the armor, serve her right.

(The deal is that you craft the armor sets the dwarves wear, since
they're running a little short on armor (no doubt from faction farmers
taking it all. It has identical stats and very similar name, and can
be turned into a tradable version. The only faction you have to hose
is Geonid Collective.)
