Maxing an Ogre's STR is too easy.  They are probably the only race/class 
combo that actually have enough to start with.  =)  You will end up having 
over 200 whether you intended to or not, even if you don't put any starting 
points in it, so don't waste the points there.

Actually, until Crustacean came along, stamina items were few and far 
between.  And Crustacean is a bit of a tradeoff for AC even just for 
Crafted.

Personally I would put the 25 into Stamina if I were to do it over again.

AGI gets added onto enough items that you'll have it over 100 without 
intending to.

Dex will also be important in the early levels, say up to 30, to keep all 
your weapon skills up.  Keep 1hs, 1hb, 2hs, 2hb and piercing all up, you'll 
need them all in the later levels.  The Ogre does start off a bit low with 
Dex.  If ultimately you decide not to put them in STA, put them in Dex.  
Maybe go half and half...

> Wis, Int, Cha ... why bother?

Yup.

Oh, please choose Rallos Zek for your diety, for two reasons.  It will 
allow you to wear cultural imbued items (the Enchanted Imbued Ogre War 
Plate is pretty nice stuff!) and it will make your life easier in Kael 
Drakkal, the giant city in Velious - all the best Warrior armor quests are 
there.
