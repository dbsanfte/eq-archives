I'm looking at the little folio I printed out back on 11/26/2002,
http://www.dotnetdiva.com/eq/songlist.aspx

For each song we see level, name effects (paragraph) group/self/AE and
instrument.

No data such as you suggest.  Perhaps some -other- page on EQdiva, or
perhaps they've subsequently updated the page to show this information...
but this particular page I printed out not all that long ago?  No, doesnt
have it.

Llyric
off to karate or perhaps I'd actually look
