White Flags
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

( - Leggatt Bros. - )

Hold me close, don't fear my body. The flesh is weak, in need of touching.
Your hands are hungry for want of knowing.
Your eyes are closed, but still they're showing.
Light the white flags of surrender.
The war is over, the battle's ended.
Like the snowflake in my hand that's melting,
Can't you feel my love?
Can't? Can't you feel my love?
Waiting to be touched? Can't you feel my love?
Like the sky touches the sea, arising, we will be.
Can't you feel my love?

In my arms no fear of falling - we can share my gravity.
See how time will stop forever,
The moment that our eyes do meet.
Light the white flags of surrender.
The war is over, the battle's ended.
Like the snowflake in my hand that's melting,
Can't you feel my love?
Can't? Can't you feel my love?
Waiting to be touched? Can't you feel my love?
Like the moon touches the sun, an eclipse then we'll be gone.
Can't you feel my love?

Capture my senses.
Ravage my perception.
Take me! Take me! Away! Away! Love!

Hold me close, don't fear my body. The flesh is weak, in need of touching.
Your hands are hungry for want of knowing.
Your eyes are closed, but still they're showing.
Light the white flags of surrender.
The war is over, the battle's ended.
Like the snowflake in my hand that's melting,
Can't you feel my love?
Can't? Can't you feel my love?
Waiting to be touched? Can't you feel my love?
Like the sky touches the sea, arising, we will be.
Can't you feel my love?
Love, can't you feel my love?
Can't you feel my love? Can't you feel my love?
Love! Love! Can't you feel my love?
Love! Love! Can't you feel my love?
Love! Love! Can't you feel my love?
Love! Love! Can't you feel my love?
Can't you? Can't you feel my love?
Love! Love! Can't you feel my love?
