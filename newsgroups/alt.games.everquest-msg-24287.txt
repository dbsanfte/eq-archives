Ok, I've had these problems before.  First thing you need to do is look at the
casting time of the spell and multiply it by ten.  From the looks of your
example, you've probably done that.  But you have to take into acount the spell
"recycle time".  This is a short pause during which you cannot recast a spell.
Also, you may need to add an extra half a second, or 5, to each pause to get
over the general spell casting recovery time.  My recommendation is to first
add 5 to each pause to give you a small buffer, then add one second, or ten, to
each pause until the macro works.  Keep in mind that the recycle time in this
example you gave is the recycle time of the DD.  If you wanted to perhaps cast
2 spells, twice each, this spell recycle time would only come into play between
casting of the same spell.  I hope all of this made sense.  If not, ask me for
clarification.  I'll try.
