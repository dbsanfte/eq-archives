That's the first thing that crossed my mind. How can he be bound at a
port spot that's dangerous? The only possibility I'm thinking of is if
the caster asked him to autofollow a short ways. Could have ported him
into NK and ran to the Gypsy camp, which is bindable. Enough stuff paths
through there that a level 4 would be toast pretty fast. It's not WC, or
Nek or Lavastorm evac, or EJ or SF. Could be iceclad, I guess, if they
ran to the docks, but really nothing much paths there. Surefall is
bindable, but from his race I doubt he's KOS there and should be fine.
Tox, WL, CS, EK, are out because of no bind areas. I'm perplexed.

For the original poster..... Did the caster ask you to follow him a ways
after the port before binding you, or bind you right where you landed?
If you followed someplace, did you zone again, or go through a tunnel?
What does the new zone look like where you are bound. Is it snowy? Green
grass? Open plains, or tents near you, or buildings? These things would
help us figure out where you are and how to get you home. Also, at your
character select screen, by the way, it will say the name of the zone
your'e currently in without having to log in and die.
