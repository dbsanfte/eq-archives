Why?  It's not like ornate molds are hard to come by.  As a guild, with 
limited raiding, we generally manage to get 4 to 6 a week easily.  With 
an average of one bp ornate mold dropping per BoT tower boss, it's really 
not hard to do.  That's not even counting the molds dropping to xp groups 
hitting named mobs in other areas of BoT.
