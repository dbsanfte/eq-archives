Well yesterday after the patch I was the *first* person logged in the game
(who all.. there are 1 players in everquest that match your request)

Quickly got a guild group together and ported to SF, zoned into HS and druss
was up.  2 other people zoned in.  Chanter had forgotten her key, so in a
matter of 1-2 mins (time to gate, port back to SF, evac to OT and zone into
HS) druss was dead!

I know its a very contested spawn.. but wtf!!
