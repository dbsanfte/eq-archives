Then you do not understand it correctly.

Actually, thats exactly what it does.

Taunt can either succeed or fail.   Which it is depends on your skill level
and the amount of hate that the top person on the aggro list has more than
you.  The higher the skill, the more hate you can overcome.

If you succeed, you are moved to the top of the hate list, just above the
person who was previously max.   If you fail, there is no effect.
