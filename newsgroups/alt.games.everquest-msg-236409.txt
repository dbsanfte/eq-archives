I love twinking a low level guy and throwing him into certain death like
that. I walked around kaesora with a level 1 halfling rogue for quite a bit.
I died, and was ported to my bind spot, and went back and did it again.
Unless you have a buff or are a caster of any sort, death is nothing to fear
at that level. Later, when you are risking gear and xp, it's a totally
different game.
