Actually DT, a LOT of people have had problems since SOL that
have nothing to do with their system specs. I am WELL above spec
on all the RECOMMENDED specs and when I enter a SOL zone
it still chugs like a college football player at a frat party.  I have to
drop quite a few video options such as sky layers and clipping distance
to bring the choppiness back under control. Even then, I have to walk
away from the moniter every half hour to 45 minutes or get a headache.
I know you just LOVE to flame people when they complain, and I
actually appreciate it most of the time, as it tends to keep a lot of us
honest about our whining, but the game HAS suffered since SOL and
some of us are only trying to keep Verant honestly trying to fix things.
We did NOT buy a new product, we bought an expansion for a product
that we already have paid good money to play. Some of the complaints
(such as the commons lagging bad now) even hit people that did NOT
install the upgrade. When problems effect innocent bystanders that did
not try to add to their game, it becomes a liability to the game community.
People before SOL could play under WIN95 (I don't know why they
didn't upgrade their OS, but that is what they began under and have played
under for the last 3 plus years) and now because of SOL they cannot play
unless they spend money supporting the Gates empire.  I don't remember
reading THAT as part of the license agreement.  Also, some people don't
have the financial means to upgrade their system every time Sony has a
whim.

Nuff said (and maybe too much)
