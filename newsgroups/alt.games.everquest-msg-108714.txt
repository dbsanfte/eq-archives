Hey folks,
Quite a few people here have mentioned Paludal caverns when talking about
great exp for lvls 10-20. I am going to go check it out tonight with my
druid, but if anyone has any reccomendations for a lvl 10 Wizzie (where some
nice hunting spots, whether I should wait a few lvls, that sort of thing), I
would really appreciate it. Barring the couple hours I spent trying a Vah
Shir beastlord, I have yet to go to Luclin, so I am trying to get up there
as quickly as I can.
TIA,
Chaos
