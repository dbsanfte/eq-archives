Most of those aren't warrior specific AA skills, they're melee archetype
skills. Combat Stability, Combat Avoidance, Natural Durability. These
are your bread and butter as a warrior. Run speed, regen and first aid
from the first teir, then those archetypes. 

Warrior class specific skills are of significantly less benefit.

Ambidextery: 6% increase in chance to dual wield
Probably pitched about right for the level of improvement it gives. Nice
'icing on the cake' upgrade.

Area Taunt: 
Triggered taunt of everything in close range
Unless this is a 100% guaranteed, massive taunt, with a small radius,
this is useless. 36minute recycle? Pfft. Given the way taunt works
currently, it probably won't even pull the mobs off an over-agroed CHing
cleric. Pretty useless at the level you get this anyway, since you'll be
fighting big hitters most of the time. Would've been better as either:
1: An inherent latent boost to the taunt skill for warriors only. 
2: A critical taunt if you like. Random firing massive taunt boost
3: A small reduction in taunt button recycle
4: a short recycle (10mins) triggered single target megataunt
5: Reduce Recycle to 3-5mins and make it guarenteed to pull 90% of
targets off all but the most overagroed
Should've been a L35ish trainer skill or /disc years ago

Bandage Wound: 
10/25/50% increase in hps healed with each bandage
Nice skill. Not overpowering, no effect on raids, but a nice 'icing' for
the warrior who has everything

Double riposte: 
15/30/50% change for a double riposte on a successful riposte
Indifferent. Very slight damage output increase I suppose, and every
little helps.

Flurry: 
Chance for 2 extra attacks with primary hand
At least it's latent. Again, very slight damage increase over time, as
well as the extra message to impress the ECo residents.

Rampage: 
Single attack PBAE melee
Triggered. 36 minute refresh. Waste of points.

Warcry:
Depends how long it lasts, but given it requires 10 points spend in
archetype fear resistance, and warriors should have enough MR to resist
enough fears to make that 10 points useless, this is definitely low down
the list of priotites

Not 'unhappy' about the list, but certainly nothing to write home about,
especially when compared with combat fury for non wars, casting fury,
clarity, free horses, ae buffing, perm charm, and several other
significantly class enhancing AA skills available to other classes.
