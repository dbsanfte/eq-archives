Uh, if you're only getting 3 and 4 points... your not completing your
mission in time.. your getting the job done after the primary timer has
expired.. 6 people might help in that aspect. (on the other hand, i might be
wrong, ive never played with any groups in their 30s in ldon. only 50 and up
so I dunno what kinda points are awarded to you. we get 4 just for failing
tho and finishing on the backup timer at lvl 54)
