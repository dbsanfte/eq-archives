Just so I understand correctly, you were engaging mobs that weren't 
moving into camp? After all, if they were moving, you would *know* they 
weren't mezzed, right? Not criticising, just trying to get a handle on 
your tactic. It seemed to me that if they were standing still, and 
therefore maybe or maybe not mezzed, there wouldn't be any need to engage 
them, as they would be no immediate threat. Or was the assumption that 
they would be summoned into the fray soon enough?

I can't count the number of times I've died with an unused HT. Being of 
the mindset to keep it banked for when I *really* need it, I often just 
forgot to use it at all. :P

Nice. I remember a time that the HT timer wasn't reset upon death. Made 
it all the more difficult to pull the trigger on it unless *absolutely* 
necessary.
