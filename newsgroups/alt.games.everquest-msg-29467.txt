Well, the first character I started wandering with was a dwarven Paladin.  I
had made my way as far as West Commons, using nothing but that thing they
call a map that comes with the game.  I certainly found myself having to ask
if this was the way to just about anywhere I needed to go.  Oh, and no ports
were involved, I actually didn't know about that yet.  Believe it or not,
there are still new people starting the game that really do have no clue
where most things are, given the level of detail of the information Verant
provides with the game.  Since then I have discovered the wonders of eqatlas
among other sites.  I also found myself asking if this was the way to
Freeport, as my barbarian shaman was making his way over to that side of the
world in order to purchase Serpant sight.
