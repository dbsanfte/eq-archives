As me and my friend say, deadpan sarcastic:
"Oh look, a dead body lying in the middle of the street. How unusual."

This started while he was playing and I was peanut gallerying on UO, in the
bad old days.

The 'problem' with pvp systems isn't the system, it's the players.

I don't mind getting pk'd once.

I don't even mind when the guy stands over my corpse and says 'd00d I
0wnz3r3d u!'

When I walk into the player town, pay the admission fee to get into the
cantina, go afk while my battle fatigue is healing (after tipping the
entertainer) only to come back and find I've been made pvp+ to town militia
and killed, and I spawn in their clone center (as I had cloned there
thinking it was a pleasent place) only to be ganked repeatedly, that I mind.

'But it's a legitimate strategy for denying you access to our town'

Bantha poodoo

(sorry for the SWG aside but that's my most recent experiences with PvP)

PvP isn't broken, people are broken.
