Well, you're right and you're wrong simulatneously.

You're right in the case I described above, it's the person and not the fact
that they're twinked that would be on my nerves.  Depending on the situation
it could either their problem or mine (kind of like the old Martin Short
skit on SNL ... "Is it me, or is it him?  It's him, isn't it??").  It's kind
of like the post about the free game in SoV yesterday.  If a lot of folks
think PC Soandso is not a problem but I do, it's my problem (or vice versa).
In either case, I can control it by removing myself from the situation and
going somewhere else to spend my two hours in Norrath.

You're wrong in thinking that I don't like twinks.  Twinking doesn't bother
me.  My opinion is along the lines you stated earlier ... if you can do it
for another of your characters, more power to you.  From a newguy
perspective, the issue reminds me of the Designated Hitter  ... purists hate
it, but to everyone else it doesn't really matter one way or the other.
