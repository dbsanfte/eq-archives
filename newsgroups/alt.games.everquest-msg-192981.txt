Find a safe zone, start playing DDD, go afk for several hours, voila!

Best zone (IMO): Arena, off Lake Rathetear. 1 Soulbinder, a pvp zone, and
nothing else. Almost no lag, no wandering mobs. Only a few minutes away
from Feerrott book, NK druid ring, or Antonica Spires.

Alternate zone: Plane of Knowledge. Guards won't aggro even if they wander
in the area of effect. No mobs. But lag can be a problem. And please be
considerate and choose an out-of-the-way spot to practice, rather than,
say, in front of the bank, in front of Nexus book, or inside the library.
