You keep lumping KEI in with all other buffs. It is clearly different. I 
don't have members of my group take off in search of Skin Like Diamond or 
Chloroplast or any other buffs. I don't have people looking down on me 
for not "doing the right thing" by ensuring I have DEX and STR buffs on 
before joining their raid.

It's silly. If it's going to be such a part of the game environment, they 
just need to bump up everyone's mana regen rate. They don't though, 
because that would be a bad idea. If everyone regen'ing mana faster is a 
bad idea, then how is everyone running around with KEI not?

And as far as all of us "really talented guys" go, I don't claim to be 
all that talented, but I do aspire to be. I feel I have a much greater 
chance by not using training wheels.
