I don't think EQ has a shortage of manpower being probably the biggest
most profitable game there is. Lokari is an idiot so I discount her
worthless opinion anyway. I think what they do or don't do is out of
consideration for those that have brought their characters to a high
level. You can bet they know about all the problems but it's more a
matter of changing the rules of the game midstream. No will will like
getting their character nerfed after playing it two years.
All in all I don't think who does what within Verant is a relative
issue. It's their responsibility to provide for the game.
