In the first place, it's a pretty contrived hypothetical.  Why can't
you just grab both kids in your arms and get all three of you out?

But in any case, you're missing the point.  The evil act is to *think*
to yourself, "my life is more important than the lives of these
children."  Evil is a state of mind, and very likely a form of
insanity.

If in blind panic you run out of the building to save yourself without
thinking at all about who deserves to die or to live, you have
certainly not done a commendable thing, but you are not evil by the
definition I am proposing.  Or not very much so, anyway, since the
thought was probably there, just buried under mountains of panic.

And you don't have to decide your life is worth less than the kids,
just that it's worth the *same* as the kids.
