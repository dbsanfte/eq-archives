The areas adjacent to Shar Val are excellent hunting grounds at your
level, and there are bard guild trainers in Shar Val and Shadeweaver
both.

Getting thru Paladul at your level will be a little tricky but not impossible,
depending on your resources.

Technique one: a higher level bard friend with Clouding.  Stay close and
just walk right thru, invisible the whole time.  Barring lag or an extraordinary

triple fail on the song this is utterly safe.

Technique two: Get invis cast from some friendly person in Shadowhaven
and just hope for the best

Technique three buy a couple Cloudy Potions from the vendors (with
your probably high charisma and faction capabilty, 10pp each) and use them
to get thru, this way you can find a clear spot and reapply invis if needed

Technique four (least likely course) find a high level wizard.  Go to
Shadowhaven
close at the paladul line, get bind. Port down to Norrath, get SOW, get TL to
bind
and run for it.

Technique five: Use your faction song on each of the KOS mob types as you
first encounter them, and just walk thru... haven't tested this, but -if- its
possible
this is far better than any invisibility.  With extremely few exceptions, mobs
don't
attack you when you sing this at them, even if it fails.  It seems to me that
there are
four kinds of mob in the caverns, the bandits (which seem to all be on one
faction) the reptilian things (which look humanoid, suggesting a faction of some
kind) and the mushrooms and bugs, latter two non aggressive.  Reptiles and
bandits aren't encountered near each other, so you can switch factions once you
get past the
bandits.

Take the Hollowshade Moor route, and you'll have a relatively clean shot at
Shar Val, its outdoors so put selos up and just ignore everything till you get
in
and bound.  At 11 there isn't anything in the zone thats going to one hit kill
you, and at Selo speed nothing is going to get more than one shot.
