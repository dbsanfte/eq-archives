You will not evade me, David Navarro <david@alcaudon.com>:

They looked like pale grey metal on me as well. They dropped in a
group one nice I had Luclin wood elf model on, and I tried them on
before giving them to a guildie. I guess plate gauntlet details
weren't high priority since both chain and leather gloves are more
detailed than before.

You'll reach that point soon. I am quite a bit above 200 wis already,
even with a lot of substandard (for my level) gear.

It depends on how much leather covers on you. Everything that isn't
bare skin when you wear usual leather will be black. IIRC, human males
are pretty well covered by leather armor, so it should still work for
you - note that a full set of gnomeskin usually means giving up more
wis than using a SBS instead of a CGS does ;)

My emergency dress code change will consist of black chitin leggings
and an imbued elven chainmail tunic, which I can put on my cleric once
I get Cel a proper tunic upgrade.
