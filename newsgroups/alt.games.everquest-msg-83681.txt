You miss the point.  The DAoC rollback was very small...people didn't
lose a signficant amount of XP.  The servers came up, people started
playing, and not too long after, the servers came down.  Repeat.

This was something that in the EQ universe would not even merit an
update on the network status page.

I posted this as an example of how a game company should treat their
customers.  As a long time EQ player, I was *shocked* to find that
Mythic was giving people significant compensation for a minor outage.
