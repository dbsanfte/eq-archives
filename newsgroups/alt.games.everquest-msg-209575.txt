Howdy...

We're looking to each charm a mob, so i guess outdoor zone with some animals
in it. LOIO seemed too low, too many green/lb adds at 26, and OT had a green
and light blue section, a tiny fragment of blue mobs and the rest red, red,
red. We're new to charm tactics so dont really want to be going reds just
yet.

We're considering sitting in HK until 29 then moving on the overthere but
would rather find someplace where we can go right off the bat now ;)

Any input welcome.

Regards,
James
