Closest I have ever seen to price fixing was 2 ppl selling the same item, a
Tolans Bracer, for 10k and talking to each other. When I offered less, 8k
(10k is actually a fair price but I figured what the hell, lets see if one
is desperate) the other knew of the offer when I sent them the same
tell/offer. I have no idea if there was any other connection other than what
they were selling, both were mules.

I can't see there ever being any price fixing that would stick for very
long, only takes one person desperate for plat to break it and then gloves
are off again.

CF
In the end I bought both the Bracers and then sold the extra for 12k :ï¿½)
