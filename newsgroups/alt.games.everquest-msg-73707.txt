I was going to suggest this, also...

I just re-installed EQ on my machine the other day and instead of using the
originals I used the Trilogy set I have.....This did not install into the
Everquest dir like the original....I don't know the exact name but I think
it stuck in Sony\EverQuestTrilogy\ or something.....anyway something with
Trilogy in the name....When I installed Luclin it had no problem finding
that directory.... SO, what I'm wondering about, is I see comments about
people moving their EQ directories around and just updating the link...I'm
wondering if this is what is causing people to have their Luclin installed
in the wrong directory.....I would think that the installer would look  in
the registry to see where a game is installed, and moving the game and not
correcting the registry would produce this.....NOW, I could be wrong cause I
really don't know if that's how it works....
