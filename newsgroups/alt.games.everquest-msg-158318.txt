I guess some guilds just have more draconian rules than others.  Personally,
I'd be more likely to associate with a guild like you describe, than one of
those uber-guilds.  After all, if I'm helping, I'm helping.  If I'm not
helping, then I'm probably not there anyways (unless it's to observe and
learn, and then I've left with something more valuable than an upgraded BP
anyways).
