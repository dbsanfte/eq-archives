    True enough, and neither were you.  But as a fairly 
long-time reader of this newsgroup, I've seen even several
threads disintegrate into petty bickering over what amount
to simple disagreement over fairly minor points.  This
isn't that minor of a point, of course, but you and I
don't really disagree, just seem to focus more on different
aspects.

   I don't, but then, I don't know anyone.  Can only go by
my own experience, which I am quite willing to allow might
be very atypical.  I do admit that neither my husband nor
I have run across any other husband/wife RL/EQ  partners.

Sorta like hoping a that having a baby will heal a marriage,
eh?  I can easily imagine what a disaster that could turn
into.  I'm a fairly good player.  Slightly better than my
husband, who isn't to shabby.  We defiantly trust each other
with our (EQ) lives.  If we die, we know that thems the breaks.
But if the RL relationship were shakey...well, I can see it 
now ::Wavy lines...."Why did you pull?  I told you I low on 
mana!"  "I was full health, and thought that you could med and
toss off an emergency heal if needed it!"  "Look asshole, 
that's _twice_ you've gotten me killed in as many hours!"
End Wavy lines:::  Yes, it could get ugly fast.

    I can appreciate that.  But I still hold that EQ doesn't
kill marriages, dumb husbands and wives do.  I believe that
marriages that fall apart due to EQ had some serious cracks
in them before hand.
