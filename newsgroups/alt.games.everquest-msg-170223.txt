Haven't seen the movie yet.

A terrible idea to rethink JRRT.  Faramir was the opposite of his
brother not Boromir II. I hope this stupid change doesn't make me hate
the movie.

Many elves were leaving Middle Earth but the Noldor (Elrond,
Galadriel, etc) all stayed until their rings stopped functioning and
had no desire to leave.
Galadriel even says in the books (missing from the movie since the
writers didn't really understand the books very well) that she wishes
the One Ring had never been wrought or had remained forever lost.

Eowyn was not described anywhere as the 3rd most beautiful woman.  But
the first two definately were - nice to put in a book but impossible
in a movie due to differing opinions.
