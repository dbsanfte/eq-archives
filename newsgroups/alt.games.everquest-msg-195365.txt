Yeah me too, and never was anyone else ever there. Can go from 10 (with nice
buffs)  to 17ish  there. 20%xp bonus, outdoor zone so even when I managed to
fight quite a ways in i could always train (with sow) when it got sticky ;)
Its a small zone.  The kitties slow you alot, dunno how effective a melee
would be there.

I did the Kerran Fishing Pole quest later on for fun ... 17delay 4 damage.
Rubbish but the delay is fast for a 1HB . A waepon that looks like a fishing
pole hehe.
