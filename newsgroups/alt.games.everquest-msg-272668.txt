Quick clarification (or nitpik, your choice ;) ).  Using Stalk or
Shadow to pull doesn't give the scout _ANY_ aggro.  Those arts
specifically reduce that aggro between the scout and the mob.  Since
they are combat arts though, they do initiate combat.  The scout in
that case starts with what is effectively a negative amount of hate
built up.

Could this be an indication that healers (in my experience, furys)
start with more hate than others?  I guess since nobody has any hate
built up (either by aggro proximity, initiating combat, etc) it means
the mobs have a natural affinity to wanting to beat up healers.  Maybe
mobs aren't as dumb as they usually seem.
