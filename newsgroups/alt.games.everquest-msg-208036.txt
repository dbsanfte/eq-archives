Um...  I'm sorry, I have to ask.  Who told you Anarchy was no-fizzle?  Or
low-fizzle?  And please don't tell me someone told you it was hard to
resist; if you don't Tash first, you're going to find you have a horrid
resist rate.

But what it boils down to is that for a 4.6 second cast time and an 8 second
recast, you're going to toss 160 mana for a possible 273 damage and a 0
second stun.  The aggro on enchanter nukes is sick with that zero-second
stun built in.  I'm not saying it has no use - I stull use Chaotic Feedback
on occasion for interrupt - but dont think it will solve all your problems.

Beguile, on the other hand, costs you 120 mana, casts in 3.5 seconds, can be
recast as soon as the gems reset, and will give you more DPS than a melee
with gear appropriate to your level.  Add in the 20 mana for a Tash before
hand if you like,for 140 mana you're still coming out ahead on mana and
damage.

I agree with you - strongly! - that evocation, like all casting skills,
should be maxed.  But I guess I'm an old-school enchanter; to me, nuking is
something to do when you can't think of anything more productive to do with
a full manabar.
