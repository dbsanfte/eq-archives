A lot of this is because from around 50 to 58 the druid's heals are
pretty pathetic compared to the damage taken, and thier other utility
doesn't make them particularly desirable in groups either, as their
damage output is fairly low in that level range as well. This causes
most druids to have to solo that level range and by the time they get
that 58 heal, they've really lost whatever skill at healing they had in
most cases. About half the druids I've met at 65 have no feel for the
healing side of their character at all and play like low damage wizards.
The other half are great to have in your group.
