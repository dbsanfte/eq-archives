 After reading the thread I thought I would post a little cheat sheet I
gathered from various forums and tip pages.  Hope this helps and this is in
no way a finished and polished copy.  Again this was for my personal use and
I thought Id share:

Hotkeys and Hints:
%t target
%s sex
%r race (does not work with all mobs..dont know if it is broken or what)
/book opens spell book and you start medding
/book # opens book to that page
/spell # is how you cast a spell with you clicking on the gem. (# 1 - 8)
this is how to do the yaulp and stun.   alt1-8 also does this
/pause=# (1 - 600 (600=1min))
 F1-8 is everyone in your group
/y yell This command shows all players within radius "NewbieXXX yells for
help to the (direction) of you!" /shouting "Help me!" no one will know where
in the zone you are.
hotkeys to do an ability such as Taunt, Bash, Disarm.  just type:
/doability # (# being the position of the ability you are trying to perform)
Example:                       Name Taunt
/cast 8 (8=stun spell)
/pause 12 delays enough to get the spell off
/doability 3 (3 = taunt)
/doability 6 (6=disarm Mobs hate it when you disarm them.)
/doability 2 (2=Bash) or you could substitute this for a spell such as flash
of light.
 /cast # (# being the loc of FoL spell.)
Example:                         you will not turn your back on me %t
/taunt
or                                 may marr stop all your movement
/spell 2 (this being stun or root)
It's easiest to make an assist hotkey in doing the above tactic (hitting the
moster the person is attacking). I normally play in full screen HUD mode so
I can see a little more.
To make a hotbutton for Assist you need to open the social and find an open
button, right click it and type in the following:
Name: assist
Desription: /assist
Mine reads as follows:
I am assiting %t
/assist
I am attacking %t
What the group sees (assuming you have groupsay as your defualt):
I am assisting jack
I am attacking a bloodgill goblin
 If it's says you're atacking your puller keep hitting it till he locks onto
a traget. This method lets everyone in the group know EXACTLY what your
doing and what your attacking. Perfect for the enchanter's to enchant the
other or someone to root/snare it.
Btw, if you find yourelf pulling you can use the same hotbutton method for
incoming, just type: incoming %t. and it will tell the group what your bring
in whatever have fun with it just no emotes as they cause lag :)
