Chain stunning and AoE mezzing was the order of the day, and it worked
for a while, but eventually you just get some unlucky rolls on resists
and such. And by that time the chanters in question are so high on the
hate list that nothing in Norrath will save them. :-(.

The wizard AoE idea certainly sounds promising in theory. Unfortunately
the whole reason I was initially let into my new guild as an appy at
only level 59 was a "technicality" based on a shortage of wizzage. :-(.

I'm sure they'll figure it out, but I was hoping to hear a more melee
oriented tip (aside from just bringing a shitload more rogues and
monks... we had one and two of them respectively).  Hrmmm... well, if
nothing else, it was a lot of fun.
