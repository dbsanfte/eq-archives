"May be"?  I'm going to hunt you down and slap you for suggesting such a 
heinous use for spiderling silks ;p  IF you gather up spiderling silks, 
save them in the bank - at most, combine 2 to make a silk thread, but 
don't go any farther.  There's a few options available to you.

1) If you have the Luclin expansion, and a connection that will allow 
it, you can go to the bazaar and sell the silks and/or thread.  Do a 
search to see what other people are selling for.

2) If you have patience, you can get your tailoring skill (which will 
have advanced a little through combining the silks) up high enough to do 
leather padding (1 low quality pelt + 1 silk thread).  Do a search to 
find out how much people are charging for it, yes, those prices are PER 
PADDING.  The shock of how much they get for it might make you happy to 
get your skill up. ;p  If it doesn't, and/or you don't have the ability 
to get to the bazaar:

3) Find a smith who is at the leather padding stage (a good place to 
leave a message would be www.eqtraders.com) on your server, and strike a 
deal to sell them either the silks, threads, or padding, depending on 
how much work you want to do.  (Keep in mind that silk thread is no 
fail, so you won't lose anything if you combine, but leather paddings 
are not no-fail, and thus, while skilling up, you'll lose a lot of em)

Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go slap someone.
