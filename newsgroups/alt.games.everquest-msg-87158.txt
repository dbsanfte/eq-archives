As you've correctly noted, I've probably posted that same piece of
advice at least a dozen times over the last year. It's a good tip that I
share with any newer players asking the "where to hunt" question for
soloists and duos in the late teens/early twenties looking for cash.
However, the fact that you pointed it out made it sound like I may have
been annoying you by posting the same information multiple times.

Upset me? You seem to be familiar with my posting history here, so I'd
venture to say that you know what I sound like when I go off on
somebody. Offering killfile details to an annoyed poster is so far below
the rader of "flaming" for my posts that it was down right civil. That
line and "upset" are about seven light years apart on my scale.

At no point in that *very* short response did I say or infer "asshole",
"arsehole" "fuckwad" "smegma breath" or any of the other classical
favorites. I think you're getting a little defensive.
