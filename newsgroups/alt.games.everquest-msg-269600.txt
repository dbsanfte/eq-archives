LOL you're correct. I'm getting my expansion letters fouled up. And I
believe Crash is right on the shared also. Too many friggen expansions -
and their acronyms!

I have. I pretty much duo with my wife and we're feeling it. The solo mobs
all seem to be below us (blue solo) or above us. I'm sure if I explored
more we could find more but the farther out we get the higher levels they
are. I'm sure if we grouped up in Blackburrow we could overcome this, but
we spent time there Saturday with the guild and I seem to make true the
adage that Raid = Death. But I have noticed it taking longer between
levels. Maybe the quest rewards are getting shallower?
