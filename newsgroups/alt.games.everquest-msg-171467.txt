Yes I remember being very annoyed with that even when I set  "let all
through". But when Norton Firewall was randomly freezing EQ during
zoning after a particular patch (some odd reason it blocked the
information flow) I gave up on it and bought Zonealarm. Solved my
zoning problem and no annoying blocks after patches.

Trouble with Norton's is that it is just too paraniod a firewall for
my taste. If you are comfortable and understand all the dangers of the
internet I'd say move on to Zonealarm.
