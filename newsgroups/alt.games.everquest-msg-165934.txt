So I went to OOT for my last yellow of 46.  There was a shaman
there doing AC camp, I grouped with him and pulled seafuries over
for kills.  We went thru a seafury or two every 6 minutes, plus
the A Cyclops spawns, and several Tainted/Corrupted and Quag
Maelstroms.  It took over three hours for me to ding 47.

Went to TD today, in the same three hours more or less I soloed
three yellow on spirocs, and far easier to do so.  OF course
there's no chance of a AC ring dropping, but other than that,
there's no comparison as far as risk per exp reward.

Any other "sweet spots" out there for low 50s?
