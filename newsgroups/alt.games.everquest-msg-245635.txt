Sometimes plat comes up missing. When I log off Eq and then log back on
later, my plat has disappeared. I have not given out password to my account.
I then thought someone hacked my comp. So I did a format on my hd and
reloaded EQ and changed password to the account, but it has happened 2 times
since I have done the format to hd. It dosen't matter if the plat is in my
inventory or the bank. If someone has a idea what is going please help. I
have petitioned Eq but have heard nothing from them.
