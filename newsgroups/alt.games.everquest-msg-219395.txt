Ah but then people who didn't have Velious would be screwed, and for the 
most part nothing in EQ expansions tie off previous expansions, which is 
really quite sad because it really contributes to mudflation... each 
previous expansion is rendered totally obsolete because the successor 
really doesn't build off it... but only the core world. So a player need 
only play in the coreworld and the latest expansion to get the best gear.
