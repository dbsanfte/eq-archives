I assume you hunt spiders for the silk.  What does a stack of silk go for?

I've been hunting Wandering Greenbloods in BB.  They drop regularly and
about every third one drops a medallion worth nearly 4p.  While waiting for
them, I go after giant scarabs and the random goblins that occasionally turn
up Green Goblin Heads and Goblin Blood Vials, both of which also go for the
same as a medallion.  In about 2-3 hours of playing, I raised about 40p.  Of
course, I drop anything that has any weight or just intrinsically low value.
For my lvl 12 wizard, the greenbloods and giant scarabs also give decent
experience while soloing.  Of course, it's a bit touch and go if the
greenblood gets in the first whack and keeps me stunned so I can't get a
nuke in edgewise.

Cheers,
Eric
