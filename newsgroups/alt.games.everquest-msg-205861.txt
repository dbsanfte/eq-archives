Because it's fun to spread misinformation (or subjective information), I
have a question about this.  This weekend we _finally_ got back to XPing
(yay 59!) and we observed an odd pattern.  Whenever my husband had his
first slow resisted (about 25% of the time, on about 400 mobs over the
course of the weekend), I had to use the TAunt button to get aggro from
him (I was using flamelick to pull with), but when he landed slow, I
didn't have to use the Taunt button.

I began to wonder if resisted spells generate more aggro than spells that
land.  Or maybe...because it's slowed, it would aggro on him if was going
to hit soon, but by the time it gets around to finally being able to
attack, I've done enough damage to get aggro without Taunting.

Ok, yeah, probably the latter, but like I said, it's fun to spread
misinformation at times. *cackle*

And on the subject of enchanter vs shaman resists...I'm curious to hear
what the guy who has played both will say.  This is one case where I don't
want to spread misinformation.
