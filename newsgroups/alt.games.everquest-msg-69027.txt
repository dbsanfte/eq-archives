I am one of the ?lucky? ones that managed to get things to work...
yeah, the engine is not exactly compatible with everybodies system...
just history repeating... UO had exactly the same problem... you know
what EA's response was?  Sue us... read the EULA... 

I suggest you do the same.  I have people in my guild, successfully
playing now, with systems varying from K6-2 450's with Voodoo3 cards
up to P4 1.8ghz machines with G3's, Kyros and various other cards.
With memory in system from 128mb to 1gb... instead of continually
bitching and moaning here, where there is NO Verant support, try the
EQ message boards, where 90% of all problems have either been solved
or worked around.

And, FWIW, 5 people tried to sue EA over the new UO engine... they
lost.
