It's not that simple. Merchants standing right next to each other in your
home town may pay differently. Generally, merchants in the wilderness zones
pay less, but I don't know if they always do.

As far as I can tell, if a merchant pays well for one item, he/she will pay
well for any item. Can anybody confirm or deny this?

>I think it goes for the little things like meat etc too

It does.
