All,

I've been looking forward to the Archetype system where you pick a
general class and specialize. I like the idea of playing and
developing a style, and picking the specializations that fit. However,
I realized that for me, since I prefer Mages, the alignment choice at
the very beginning of the game undermines that whole process.

I think I like Necromancers, and I think I like Wizards. I can pick
Freeport, and play a while, but at level 10 I have to pick. Do I like
summoning or zapping more? Lets say I decide I really dig the zapping.
I pick Sorcerer. Then I get to level 20, and decide that zapping
people is cool. I like Elemental Powers more ... and yet I'm evil. Can
I quest to join the good city, Qeynos, since I want to become a Wizard
instead of a Warlock? If so, didn't the entire process of play just
burden me and force me into a hard alignment/city change quest? If I
had known I don't like disease direct damage spells but that I liked
zapping, I would have picked Qeynos.

Also, for a system that allows gradual choice to get your playstyle to
where you want it, the city/alignment choice also undermines finding
your own style, unless I'm just mistaken on how alignment affects the
level 20 decision. What if I really like doing the evil quests but I
prefer elemental magic? Is Wizard good only and Warlock evil only?
Maybe I have to make a hard choice, but if my desire to play evil
quests and my spell or class selection conflict, BOOM! I may have to
re-roll at level 1 in order to go down the path of the one I decided
was more important to me.

Is this going to be a problem in the game? Or can a Necromancer serve
Qeynos? Can a Wizard serve Freeport?

Lewis
