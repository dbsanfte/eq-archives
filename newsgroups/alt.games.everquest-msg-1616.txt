I just recently hit lvl 20 with my necromancer and was unable to find the
great majority of my new spells after visiting the vendors in Freeport and
Paineel, Ive also been hunting in the East Karanas and havent gotten any
words for research. Does anyone know of a good place to get the spells or
the for research. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
            Thanks,
