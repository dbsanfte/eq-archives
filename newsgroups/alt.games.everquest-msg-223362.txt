On Tunare, some folks in PoK have been going to the banks and Nexus stone
and cast the AOE Trans to Bind spell.  It happened a couple times today.  Is
this rude or no?  (Please note the "ambush" part--there is no warning and no
request.)

It was suggested in OOC that the offenders should be petitioned if they keep
it up.  Others said there's no point, just decline the box.  Then the camps
became split; some say the box is mandatory, others insist it's not.

(I'm pretty sure the box toggles on and off, though I can't find out how to
do it in-game.  Someone did the AOE trans at the Nexus stone last week while
folks were gathered for a MGB, and about twenty people suddenly were ported
at the same instance that I got my pop up box.  I doubt they all suddenly
went, "By god, I'd been meaning to go to my bind point instead of getting a
buff.  Thank you, anonymous Wizard!")

What say you?

Myself:  I'm in the "it's rude" camp.  If I want to go to bind, I'll gate or
find a Wizard, thanks.
