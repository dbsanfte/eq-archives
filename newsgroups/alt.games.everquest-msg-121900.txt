You mean aside from the fact that it's mind-numbingly stupid and
completely out of place in a fantasy setting? Frankly, I did the guy a

Specifically, at the time it was petitioned it was a clear violation
of the rule regarding names that make a sentence. Tragically, that
rule appears to no longer exist.

No, you're correct. "Indian" style names do not bother me.
