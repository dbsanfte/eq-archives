For *you* it may all be about XP/time. For me it's a function of "something
interesting, fun, and/or productive to do". Waiting for ships is boring.
Waiting on board the ships is even worse -- no fishing, no spell practicing,
can't go afk or camp, etc. Waiting for Nexus spires is boring. Running
across Western Plains of Karana for the nth time is boring. Been there,
done that. It doesn't matter to me whether I'm off to find a place to
hunt, trying to get to the one merchant who sells large sprocket molds,
or running to Bazaar to buy a Velium Warhammer. One doesn't have to be a
"nose to the xp grindstone" type to have gotten bored and annoyed with
EQ's frustrating travel setup.
