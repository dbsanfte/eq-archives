The problem here, Kaev, is if I say, "I'm a
liberal/conservation/libertarian/Greenie" then when the leader of my chosen
campfire strip down and dance naked in front of the White House, or some
other equally embarrassing thing (which I promise you they *will* do, no
matter how much you think you agree with them, there will be things they'll
do and say that will make you cringe), it's a bit late to go and say,
"Actually people I'm not *really* at that campfire, I was just warming my
hands for a second" because you've already told the universe with immense
pride that that is *your* campfire of choice.  So you will either find
yourself bouncing from campfire to campfire, or settling your political
blinders firmly into place and defending whatever goings-on at your campfire
*don't* make you want to puke.

Frankly I don't understand why anyone needs a political campfire.  I don't
really need to have people around me to say, "Yeah, man, he's right, man,
this dude knows what he's talkin about, man."  Many of my friends and I have
similar views (though many don't), but I reserve the right to disagree with
*anyone*, no matter how many times I've agreed with them in the past, and
whether or not I've voted for them :)

I suppose the "campfire" theory works for Sanjian and some others, but
personally I'll take responsibility for my own opinions and let everyone
else take responsibility for theirs.
