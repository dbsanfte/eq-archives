Perhaps, but he's talking about a death right after you've leveled in
DAoC, where you won't lose much XP, because it is capped at how far
you are into the level.  A death with res in DAoC has no real penalty
at all if you are barely into the level.  An death without a res at
that point can cost money for con points, but that's all.
