Recognized it right away, but my first thought was Stranger in a Strange 
Land.  A little thought though and I realized it had to be Starship 
Troopers.  Then I ended up hunting thru a good half the book, thinking 
it might be MR. Dubois, or even Zim... heck, if there's a Heinlein flaw 
its that there's a remarkable similarity to the way various wiser older 
men tend to talk.  In the end, I spotted it in the section where he's 
using Major Reid to do his Socrates imitation, chapter XII.  The "young 
man" he's responding to might be Rico, or it might be someone else in 
the class, its not specified.
