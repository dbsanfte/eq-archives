I quote myself:
"I am almost every time thrown back to the server select screen"
Sometimes,it makes me quit playing EQ.

How many postings did you see prior to OoW release,where people
were requesting to raise the level cap?

Most players I know,have a horrible time in OoW zones,if they dont
turn the clip plane way down,so what it is this graphic update good
for?

Hm,I prefere stability by far,at least I would expect that it stays
the same when adding new stuff.

The maps were working fine when released,its an impertinence by SOE
that they dont fix it.Why should the player use annoying workarounds
which make the game less enjoyable?Really this cant be hard to fix.
