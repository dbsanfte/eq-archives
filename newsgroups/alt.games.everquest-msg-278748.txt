As a cleric, I usually lose people with plenty of mana left, not due to 
lag or connection issues, but due to misplaced aggro.

Sometimes its due to "mistakes" but that's to broad. As often as not 
we'll be fighting something that will shred any group member but the 
tank (ie a 'difficult' mob, and we'll get a 'difficult' wandering add or 
respawn. 

By diffult, I mean difficult to control... e.g. the constructs and 
golems in the hole... unmezzable, and so magic resistant that you can't 
reliably park with root, or land slow or anything. And the zone is quite 
dense so kiting isn't much of an option either.
