I tried out a female human monk on Test last night, out of curiosity. 
Well, the running, IMO, does look a little better on humans anyway. 
The human female used to run like she was trying to hold a book
between her thighs.  Now it looks a bit more realistic.  However, I
don't know what they did with the turning animation.  It looks like
they dampened it, or almost removed the animation altogether... now
you just wiggle a little bit as you pivot.  Not so good.

Overall score... B-
