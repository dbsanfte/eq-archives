Your standing mana regen is about 2 mana per tic, which means that even
breeze should have a noticable effect if you are patient; try casting away
two bubbles of mana, then standing while one regens with breeze on, click the
breeze off and wait till the second one regens, time the two and compare.

If you have FT 1, your standing mana regen is now 3, so Breeze is only 2/3rds
as visible a boost.

Sitting, your mana regen is substantially higher, based on your medition
skill.  I have no idea what the formula actually is, but lets guess at your
level in mana.  Now at 18, 18 mana per tic without breeze, 20 mana per tic
with breeze... thats only a 10% or so improvement, hard to see.

Even Clarity, with 4 to 7 mana per tic, won't look like much while you are
sitting, on the other hand it works all the time, sitting or standing, so you
generate an extra 40 to 70 mana a minute for the entire duration of the
spell... and thats at a minimum tripling your standing mana regen, to more
than quadrupling at the high end.
