Well... now your suggesting that doing something worth doing is separate 
from advancement, and that advancement is its own thing that one does 
for its own sake.

This works, I suppose, and on some level is what EQ is. 

However, avancement should *not* be its own thing, it should come 
through completion of other things. And it should come faster if one 
succeeds at doing  things that are 'difficult', and slower when one is 
just standing there doing nothing of consequence.

Agreed. But gaining experience should be too. How can you do something 
on that level, and not learn from it??

By definition, if they are beyond what you can do then you cannot do 
them. Period. The edge of your ability is as good as it gets.

That is the matter of greatest concern to me. Accepting a challenge and 
entering situations where you are doing something hard, where you as a 
player actually are tested, where you as a player actually learn to play 
your class... these are the sorts of things that I think are 'worth 
mentioning' (although we seem to differ slightly on this)... and these 
are the least rewarding things in terms of what your character gets in 
terms of progression. 

In my view playing through an event that tests the play ability of the 
player should reward the character in XP... yet the converse is true... 
testing the player routinely sets the character back 5 hours, while 
playing it safe, learning nothing at all, will power level your 
character forward at incomparable speed.
