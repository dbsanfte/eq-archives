}What follows is an in-characterization of an 'invasion' upon the Dark Elf
}city of Neriak by two Dwarven brothers, Claviger and Hartwin.

And it was a -fabulous- post!  Good job!  More, more!

}but shortly thin's changed slightly. A young Dark Elf shadow knight,
}apparen'ly with some grudge again' the guards, came up ta us and began
}asking if he could loot some o' the corpses. Beggars are always annoyin',
}but especially beggars o' the same race that we are killin'. As he was
}young, we had no desire ta kill him, so we decided ta have a bit o' fun with
}him instead.
}    I decided ta let him have the shields we'd been lootin', since they were
}o' little value, and Claviger told him that he should take a swipe at each
}guard once they began ta run. This got him kilt twice that I saw, although
}his god brought him back to life each time and he rejoined us. 

Ok, -that- was just cruel.  He's obviously a newbie, and doesn't know any 
better.  Setting him up to ruin his hometown faction?  Mean!  Bad dwarf! 
No biscuit!

}    We began drawin' a crowd o' the local residents, with whom we had no
}particular grudge, ta watch the festivities and before long, they began ta
}interfere. They would get in the way while we were tryin' ta fight the
}guards, then they began callin' ta other guards ta assist, and soon we had a
}mass o' guards upon us.

}When this got us killed, I was rather pissed off about
}them training on us, but Clav's player, a long-time friend of mine, felt
}that they were keeping completely in RP by defending their city in such a
}fashion. He finally convinced me of that, although I still think it was a
}bit underhanded and dirty to train on us to the point of getting us killed.
}After all, it's an RP server, not a PK one, but...underhanded or not, I do
}agree that it was still RP, and what else to expect of a Dark Elf but
}something underhanded and dirty (for in-character play, that is)? 

I agree entirely that this was good RP on their part, and applaud you for 
rising to the challenge and not whining to GMs.  Especially in light of 
your treacherous treatment of the newbie above...  Note, I would not 
generally countenance deliberate trains, but within the scope of this 
particular event, I think it wholly appropriate.

}    Too bad the Neriak daily news won't contain an article about the
}'invasion' of the Dark City by a 'horde' of two Dwarven brothers. :P We did
}manage to create quite a controversy in that city yesterday. And we had a
}great time doing it, too. :)

Did you post about this on the Firiona Vie messageboard?  Much better than 
the ingame newspaper. :)  

Being a Gnome, I tend to wander through Neriak a fair amount 
vendor-diving.  I've come across a couple of these raids going on, usually 
Iksar, for some reason.  I wonder if I might have seen yours there, I 
seem to recall one a few days ago, but didn't stay in Foreign Quarter 
very long.  I applaud your creation of a roleplay-worthy event!  I've long 
dreamt of amassing an army capable of razing Freeport to the ground...  
Usually with one of my Dark Elf characters.  I have bitter resentment of 
my first experience with the Knights of Truth beating my sorry newbie ass 
up just for playing tourist. :)
