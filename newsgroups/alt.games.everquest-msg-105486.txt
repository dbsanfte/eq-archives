I tried to follow the instructions here
(http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/accounts_billing/rate_faq.jsp)
to extend my account for an additional 12 months at the lower rates,
but there's no 12 and 24 month selections on the "Everquest
Subscription" page. This is supposed to be available April 10th -
24th.

According to the instructions:

"Launch the EverQuest Game and go to the Login screen. Click the
"Account" button and then click "Change Account."

Enter your Station Name and password, and then click "Edit Billing."

Next you will see the EverQuest Subscription page on the left and the
EverQuest Legends access page on the right. Choose the EverQuest
Subscription page and then check mark one of the two options (12 month
or 24 month) that you wish to take advantage of. "

When I click the "Edit Billing" button, and go to the Everquest
Subscription page, I only see the usual 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and
"game card" selections.

Has anyone been able to extend their account yet?

Thanks
