I really don't know. And they always have really disgusting pot bellies, too. 

I found something really hilarious in that website that "What's Up?"
posted...read this.

"For example, a racially mixed couple will be respected, liked, and socially
sought after by other characters, as will a "take charge" Black scholar or
businessman, or a sensitive and talented homosexual, or a poor but honest and
hardworking illegal alien from Mexico. On the other hand, a White racist --
that is, any racially conscious White person who looks askance at miscegenation
or at the rapidly darkening racial situation in America -- is portrayed, at
best, as a despicable bigot who is reviled by the other characters, or, at
worst, as a dangerous psychopath who is fascinated by firearms and is a menace
to all law-abiding citizens. The White racist "gun nut," in fact, has become a
familiar stereotype on TV shows."

Looks like they took a taste of their own medicine.
