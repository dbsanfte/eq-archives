Head to OT the experience is great and can take you to 40
easily, though the loot sucks.  As for soloing, I can't help
you there, your not much of a solo class being a melee
character.  I would say somewhere with undead since your a
pally but not sure where to suggest.  The Basement of Unrest
would be good experience for you in a group.
