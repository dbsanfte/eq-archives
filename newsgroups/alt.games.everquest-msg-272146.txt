One of the few things I actually really liked about the EQ1 tradeskill 
system was that you could actually learn all of the tradeskills, and not 
be so dependant on others.  I remember many times, before I GMed most of 
the tradeskills, having to troll the bazaar repeatedly in the hopes of 
finding some of the subcomponents I needed that required a different 
tradeskill to make, it got extremely frustrating at times.
