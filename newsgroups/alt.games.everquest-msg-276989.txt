Yes actually it does. Those zones do not challenge -anybody-. Your 
enchanters won't know the subtleties of when to use which mez. Your 
clerics won't know which heal to select, or how to conserve mana, or 
know when to forget healing and nuke, or how to choose who to let die 
and who to save when things get messy. Pullers haven't learned any of 
the subtleties of pulling... chain aggro vs direct aggro, how pacify 
works, how water affects pulling, aggro, and spells, etc etc etc.

I group regularly with people in their late 50s and even 60s who don't 
know how enrage works, who don't know how to position mobs, nor where 
they should be positioned, who don't know how to use root aggro, who've 
never fought a mob that must be cast at from melee range, who don't 
really know how to avoid getting aggro...

Because they've never had to learn.

These standardized progressions are full of hypertwinks that not only 
don't really learn much themselves (although they presumably have high 
level mains that know many of the mechanics at least, if not the 
subtleties of their new alts class) but its the newbies who group with 
them who really suffer... these hypertwinks don't worry about pulling, 
or crowd control, and generate so much dps aggro control is a nonissue, 
... the group just powers through everything with no finesse at all and 
no need for it; they've got gear and armour and pok buffs that let them 
survive just about anything no matter how incompetent you are. As long 
as the cleric throws a couple cheals during the fight you can't lose. 
Slow is optional, most mobs don't live long enough to make it worth 
landing.

Given a PoJ group with a 60+ tank and half decent healer and/or slower 
and nobody else even needs to be there. They show up press auto attack, 
cast some nukes, chat with friends, try to estimate exactly how many 
kills it will be before they ding. That's pretty much leeching xp in my 
books. Call it earning it if you like; but they're being gimped their 
xp. Sure they're contributing dps or heals or whatever, no doubt, but 
they aren't -working- at staying alive. Half of them are doing homework, 
chatting with friends, watching TV and eating... if the shit hit the fan 
they'd wipe... but in those groups the shit never hits the fan.

I luckily have a good regular midlevel core group that I group with 
regularly comprising a knight, cleric, and enchanter... we frequently 
add people who we see lfg... from Rogues, to Beastlords to Necromancers 
to Wizards to Bards.

I didn't say PLing for a reason. I'd call it "simple xp grinding".

That nominally describes PC Bandits, OT Ramp, DL, and PoP grind groups. 
A couple people in the group so ubertwinked that the whole group just 
sort of coasts.

Yes it does. Those zones do not teach a player anything. The tactics and 
skills you learned in PC are reused all the way up with nothing 
substantial added along the way. You can only learn so much sitting next 
to a zone line contributing "normal dps" or even heals to groups full of 
ubertwink tanks & dps monsters.

And you will never be able to cope with being deep in a dungeon cracking 
a room with a named and 4 red/yellow adds with no zone line handy... 
because if you had 5 reds in the OT and the cleric started running low 
on mana the group would just zone. ie... any time a situation arises 
where you'd *need* to apply slows, mezzes, triage on the heals, chaining 
pets to buy someone else (e.g. clr or enc) time to regen mana, root 
parking/splitting etc... all these new players have never done any of 
that... they just know to run when the healers dry up and the camp is 
full of angry red mobs. And when they can't run... one of three things 
happens... 1) They freeze up and die. 2) They bolt and die somewhere 
else. (the worst reaction) or 3) They start learning to play their class 
better.. (the best reaction)... but ideally they should have started 
learning and practicing these tactics in SolA or Unrest... not at 65th 
level.
