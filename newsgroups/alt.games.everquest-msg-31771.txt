Stats on full set of crafted:

AC 118
+9 STR
+5 STA

+5 CHA

+4 DEX
+4 INT
+2 CR
+2 FR
+2 DR

+4 MR
+25 HP
weight = 54

You cannot buy crafted, unless you but it from another player. If you quest
for it yourself, you will need:

4 rubies
4 star rubies
4 sapphires
3 fire emeralds

as well as certain mob drops, of which about half are no drop.

Also, there is no crafted belt or cloak. A good belt is the straw spun belt
(AC 10 wt 6), but since it drops off giants you may want to buy this. As for
the cloak, I personally am wearing a supple black cloak from Runnyeye (AC 8
wt 1).

Just FYI
