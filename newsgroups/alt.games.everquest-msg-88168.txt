Jazz, I have a GeForce2 MX400 with 64MB of ram.  I am running version 23.11
of the drivers, without any problems.  I am using Win2k though, not win
9x/me.   I experienced no problems after the last patch.  I have a friend
who has major problems post patch with a different GeForce2 card, but using
an older version of the driver.  Not sure which version of Windows she uses
though.
