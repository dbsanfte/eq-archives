Oh hush; you asked, he answered, the answer was as expected, and if
he'd been flaunting uberness (goodness knows I bash him for that often
enough) he wouldn't have bothered checking with his guild's needs
before dressing up his warrior.

Heck, he even joked about the fun sound of killing dorfs.

(By the way, is everyone you play with on Giant faction and hunting in
NToV? And if you want uberness flaunted, I could mention the monk on
my server who handed stuff like FBSS and white gold necklace to the
Thurg bankers because he/she couldn't be bothered selling it.)
