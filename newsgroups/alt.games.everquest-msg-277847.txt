You and I both know that they're polling about anything is pretty much just 
to give the playerbase the illusion of control in a situation where they 
have none (or very little .. about the only true control they have is to 
take their subscription elsewhere).

My dime says that the decision has been made and the servers are being 
prepped as we type.  Running a poll is the equivalent of offering a kid a 
sucker after a haircut ... it shuts him up long enough for you to get the 
job done.

My (somewhat cynical) 2 cents, FWIW.
