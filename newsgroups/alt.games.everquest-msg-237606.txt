You really should have prefaced it OT.  :)

Interesting, most arguments about God and Free Will go the other way.
As the paradoxical omniscience often ascribed to God generally is
argued to preclude free will. 

Yet you think God is required to get free will, although I'm not
strictly sure why. It sounds like you think the universe would be
absolutely causal without it so your actions today were inevitable
since the beginning?

Personally I think there is enough true randomness in the universe to
at least prevent absolute causality from making the future completely
predictable.

That gives enough wiggle room to allow for free will too.
