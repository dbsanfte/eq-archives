There are a ton of magical swords in the game, though not many available
to a level 21 anything.  You'll have to buy one or get a high level friend
to farm or give one to you.

Check out www.allakhazam.com.  Go to the equipment section, "by slot", and
then primary melee.  You can order the listing by stats, name, etc.
The swords are either dropped by mobs or are acquired by doing a quest.

About the cheapest are the velium swords.  Should run less than 25pp.
Not too long ago, I bought a focused ethereal sword off of a vendor for 5pp.
It's a very nice lowbie sword for a great price.
