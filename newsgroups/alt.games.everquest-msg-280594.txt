This is essentially what I did with my cleric, rooting the guard, then 
atoning him.  The beauty, though, of the charm plan, is that I never do 
anything at all to the guard, so I don't have to worry about aggro on 
him... which is good, since as a bard it will be a long time before I 
get a mem blur.

The other good thing about it, though, is that I can with a little luck 
use this tactic to swarm the victim; just as with normal charm swarming, 
the object is to get several mobs hurting one mob, so you multiply your 
DPS.  Trouble with swarming is that you really have to worry about 
keeping all those mobs on your target instead of on you, and when charm 
breaks, your target plus all the mobs come straight for you.  Since I 
haven't aggroed the guards, though, they don't come for me, and since I 
haven't charmed the target, it doesn't break and come for me either, not 
till I'm ready for it anyway.

Charming, to use swarming, I'd have to have some sort of AE mez and AE 
mem blur.

I worked this out in Neth Lair, where the Neth drones etc are KOS to the 
  Haven guards.  Mobs were from green to cyan to barely dark blue, I was 
capable of meleeing them down or fear kiting them or charm killing 
them... but I was having trouble with adds, and with running over other 
groups while fear kiting, where the AE nature of bard fear caused 
trouble at least once.  In the end, this tactic was more kills per hour 
than melee and heal, or than fear kiting if you take into account the 
times I ended up running to zone to clear aggro.

I'm using it now, though, in Great Divide, pulling first wolves and now 
scouts over to the coldain wolves and wolfmasters.  In NL it was 
difficult to get a swarm on the mob, because there were lone guards up 
in front and the other pair were way back from that point.  In GD, 
though, its relatively simple to get a swarm going, as the bad guys run 
faster and stick with me better, even after aggroing one or two coldain 
wolves (I build hate with chanting all the way over to the coldain 
area).  Once I have a few guards at work, I snare the victim and then 
run off using selos to a good distance, which generally causes the 
victim to turn and attack his tormenters.  Once that happens, there 
seems to be no way to get him back off of them, I've tried all ranged 
songs, but its safe as houses.

I have to admit, I'm losing a fair amount of coldain, but I never take a 
faction hit for doing so, since its a mob who isn't my pet doing the 
killing.  I wish I could find tougher guards, since the level of the 
guards is entirely irrelvant to the proposition (the key is whether I 
can land charm on the mob, I never do anything at all to the guards, so 
their level doesn't deter me).  Well, no, I did find a tougher set, 
Captain Stonesomething... but he took out my red to me scout in the time 
it took me to type one sentence!

So another question, then, is what zones have mobs that are KOS to each 
other, and with at least one set who won't be KOS to me (even if I have 
to use Carrilion to make that happen)
