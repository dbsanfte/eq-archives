Nope, Dan Day is correct here.

I'm guessing he's posting his statement on the basis of direct personal
experience, just like I'm about to:

  You meditate while casting spells when on horseback.

Yes, I tested this myself after yesterday's patch.  I play a level 60
cleric: I can complete heal (10 secs), I can MoK from my Velious BP (10
secs) and I can Word of Health from my Velious greaves (12 secs).
While on horseback I used my greaves to chain-heal myself for about
1800 HP (which takes about 3 minutes worth of casting).  During that
time, I regained mana as if I was just sitting down.
