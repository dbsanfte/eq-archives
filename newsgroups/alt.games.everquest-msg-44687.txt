OK, so basically is seems that different servers have vastly different
ways to form up groups.  I'm really shocked by this.  You guys do know
that you can port to EJ from anywhere, now, right?  I know I did see
folks looking for ports to EJ in KC a while ago, and maybe one or two
might have decided to go to seb as a group after the port, but that's
about it.

On Innoruuk, Chardok is either empty or being raided by a guild.  I
don't think I've ever really seen anyone there, but I've only been
there raiding.  I guess it could be that I'm just not there enough and
that most nights two separate groups could be working it, friends,
small-guids.  Sebelis, always full.  There are at least 30 people in
Sebelis.  Ok, not until 30 minutes after the servers are up.  The
half-dozen or so waiting may not have their LFG tags on, but they're
looking just the same.  That doesn't mean that it won't take 30
minutes or so to get a group, though I don't think I've ever waited
that long.

I guess I never thought about it, bards travel pretty much anywhere,
and pretty much kill anything we can solo while we're traveling.  I
travel out of my way to find stuff that can aggro me so I can get exp
while checking out various hunting places.  Some days the best exp I
get is running to check out camp, but I can see how that could be
tough travel for most folks, quite a few sow'd mobs there.  Another
reason that folks camp in Seb I guess.  Log on, lfg, fight, back to
zone, log off.  No messy travel needed.

You're a cleric man, think like one!  Just outside the seb zone are
all sorts of single-pullable undead.  If you log on and can't get a
group, jump out and poach undead for exp.  Pop into seb to med and
check again.  Seems like any group losing one could use a good healer.
Seriously, next time you get a group hunting there, just camp out at
the orb in TT.  

What was the population like on Morel Thule before they started hiding
numbers?  Does anyone who plays characters on different servers see
other rather significant differences on where people hunt on the
servers?   
(Sidebar--Is the consensus that servers are now ordered most popular
to least popular?  If so Innoruuk seems to have taken a rather big
plunge, but I'm seeing as many or more folks in zones as before.
Maybe they're all hiding invisable somewhere.)
