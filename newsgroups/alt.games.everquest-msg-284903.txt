Hi All

I hadn't realised how well the Drakkin animations have been done,
until my lvl 1 Drakkin female sat down to camp, in PoK, heh.  I had
three or four people making comments such as "Wow!" and "Amazing!",
and it turned out they were commenting about how she sat down, believe
it or now  :D  I hadn't seen it, so when I F9'd out for a peek at
myself, and did a repeat performance, I too was impressed at how well
they had animated the model.  Very lifelike indeed, so points scored
there, Sony  :)
