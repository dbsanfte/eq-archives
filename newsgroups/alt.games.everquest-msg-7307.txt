I'd posted when this came up last week that Kendrick (a Verant employee) has
said that they do NOT consider this an exploit, but an oversight on their
part.  He said it would be patched *very* soon.

In the meantime, I tried this quest ... once.  Every meat must be given to
the NPC in fours.  That's hundreds and hundreds of transfers that took me
hours to complete once.  Even if they never fixed it, I would never do it
again.
