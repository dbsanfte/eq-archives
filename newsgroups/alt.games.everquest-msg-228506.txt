It's Official. Upon completing the latest Rune puzzle, one is presented with
a teaser trailer of Nedaria's landing, a look at the maiden's voyage (one
BIG-ASS Boat) and The Logo, officially Confirming that EQ:7 is Gates of
Discord.

Some delving into testeverquest.exe with a Hex editor Reveals that there are
19 Zones(or possibly more) in GoD:

tacvi - Tacvi, Seat of the Slaver
txevu - Txevu, Lair of the Elites
inktuta - Inktu`Ta, The Unmasked Chapel
ikkinz - Ikkinz, Antechamber of Destruction
kodtaz - Kod'Taz, Sullied Ritual Hall
uqua - Uqua, The Ocean God Chantry
yxtta - Yxtta, Pulpit of Exiles
vxed - Vxed, The Crumbling Caverns
tipt - Tipt, Treacherous Crags
snfurnace - Sewers of Nihilia, Emanating Furnace
snplant - Sewers of Nihilia, Purifying Plant
snlair - Sewers of Nihilia, Lair of Trapped Ones
snpool - Sewers of Nihilia, Pool of Sludge
ferubi - Ferubi, Forgotten Temple of Talosia
barindu - Barindu, Hanging Gardens
riwwi - Riwwi, Coliseum of Games
qinimi - Qinimi, Court of Nihilia
natimbi - Natimbi, The Broken Shores
abysmal - Abysmal Sea

We're looking at about 10 Raiding zones, some instanced. Allakhazam and Lucy
are giving us Level 70 Spells and items on test, so it seems that They're
giving us another 5 levels to play with, and more AA's are Practically BOUND
to happen.

But it's not all "Here's 19 zones and a Giant boat! Have Fun!"

Tunare, EQ's Graphics engine, is getting a MAJOR facelift, Jumping to
Version 3.0. RAM-Hog Vertex animation is being replaced with Bones and
Inverse kinematics, as well as many other Efficiency corrections to the
game's code, which will practically HALVE the system requirements of EQ, and
allow lower-end users to play with luclin models/high texture quality, etc,
Increasing Framerates, Decreasing Lag caused by loading problems, and Making
Zone times almost NON-EXISTENT.  Also, Old-world zones are getting a
graphical Cleanup, as has been said, with rumours abounging of Higher Poly
models for Classic old-world Mobs..
