Ive said it before, and I'll say it again....
Until another mmorpg comes up with the idea of creating copies of your eq
chars, people will stick with their eq chars instead of starting a totally
new character in another game, even if the game is better. Well... maybe not
everyone, but haaving to start a new char instead of playing your levl 60 is
enough to put a lot of people off. If you think thats silly and will never
happen, then you dont have much idea about business annd making money imo.
