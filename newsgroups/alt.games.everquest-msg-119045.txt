I really wish I could, but I'm afraid it *really* is out of my reach. They 
go for about 50k in my server, and, providing I play some long hours and do 
*nothing* but port people around (doing the Bazaar/DL/GD cash run), the 
most I can hope for is about 1k per session. I'm not really about to spend 
two months RL time saving up for that monkey. :)

But I agree, anyway... Those things rock. One dropped during my first Fear 
raid, but the leaders only invited INT casters to roll on it.
