Hehe.
Yeah I was shown this a couple of weeks ago by one of the directors in my
company (a couple of them, my boss included, play AC)
We were talking about incidents where we had been threatened physically
online and our stories were very similar, always the person assumed they are
talking to some spotty little teenager and always seemed to insist on
bringing our mothers into the conversation. I won't speak for myself, lest I
am viewed as saying that I am an intimidating version of Ricky Martin but my
colleague instructs a Kung Fu class, of course for all we knew we could have
been threatened by one of the Kronk gyms up and coming talents or one of the
Gracie's but I doubt it.
