I'm guessing he means tick since i was getting 3 ticks per 2 kills with my
26 Sk last night (an occasional white or yellow gave more, the majority were
blue).  I teamed up with a 25 Shm after a bit to speed things up and got 1
tick per kill from there on.  I got half a level there and moved on, there
are better places. This was as a Troll, so I don't know how the xp penalty
plays into that.
