Yeah, I wrote about this one in beta. The quest has undergone some changes 
since then but it's still basically the same idea and Graeme has outlined it 
pretty well. It's one of my favorites for that level. One thing I would add 
to the discussion of the reward is that doing it at level 15 yielded me 
almost 50% experience, and that alone just about eclipsed the loot.
