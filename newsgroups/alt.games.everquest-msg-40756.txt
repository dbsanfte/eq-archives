They were very similar. 

Like today, and as it will be again soon, Odus was nearly totally
empty. In the long run The Hole will be the only thing in that area to
get traffic since people eventually HAVE to go there for some stuff.
The warrens and Stonebrunt were done with trvial loot code in the
WORST possible locations to do that, in a sense just ensuring that in
2 months even stonebrunt will be totally empty. I mean before some
high levels may have been running around in there getting quests and
factioning when bored but now even they can't. Lower levels meanwhile
don't hang around such areas for long since they are in a very bad
area to do much or get back to other things unless they can teleport.

Verant just does not seem to get the clue with Odus, its the area and
getting there, not the zones themselves. Due to that they have to
REALLY give people a reason to go there like the hole. Warrens and
Stone brunt trvial loot code combined with very cruddy drops is the
opposite of having a reason. They did not seem to get the clue when
they revamped kerra (wow.. yeah.. good going verant boy did that
change things.. ahahahah) and a handful of people came to look then
never returned, they did not get they point when they did the warrens
and after an initial tour people no longer showed up and they probably
won't get the point with stonebrunt either. Lucky for the players
though Verant will soon run out of places to dump zones in the Black
Hole of Norrath. They've essentially made the area better for the few
people starting on a new server playing Eruds.. until of course soon
they can't find groups and will be running off for other areas, like
always.. since the start of EQ.

Fay is nearly exactly the same, the only big difference really being
the inclusion of a dark elf camp in lesser fay and some brownies for
the druid epic. The dark elf camp is for the dark elf/human/troll
cleric/shaman symbol of innoruuk quest. 

An is probably the least changed.

Odus is the most changed old world area in the game probably, and the
one which receives the least traffic anyway ;) Meanwhile dumping a
stonebrunt sized zone by an area like east commons would have made a
ton of difference for the life of the game, not just a month or so.
