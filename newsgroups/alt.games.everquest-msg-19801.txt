That's always how they handle this.  E.g., when two servers split to a
new third server, someone with a conflicting name gets an X.  Or, when
a server completely dies and they restore from backups, and a deleted
character had your name, one of you gets an X.

In these situations, if you don't like the X, you can petition for a
name change.  I don't know if they will allow name changes if you
don't like your X after a paid move.

Note that if your name ends in "se", that "x" could make your name
violate the naming policy!  E.g., "boyse" becomes "boysex".
