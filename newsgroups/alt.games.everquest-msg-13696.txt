I make no such admission, and I do not see it as a problem for me at all.

I am not exacting "retribution" for the inspection.  I am simply using the
inspection to characterize the person according to criteria I have set for
my own purposes.  I don't see the point in leaving the message off ... at
least for me.  I do not get annoyed or upset by their rude behavior, I
simply recognize them as rude and choose to remember it.  I do not insult
them, or pester them, or do anything against them.

The standard for lameness is subjective and you are certainly allowed to set
your threshold where you wish ... as am I.  To some people the whole EQ game
is lame.  Your debate of my attitude might also be viewed as petty.
