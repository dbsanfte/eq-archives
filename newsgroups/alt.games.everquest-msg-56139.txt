  Heh, well, bards are weird. :P  They follow different rules than other
classes, and I don't really think you can blame other players for not
recognizing the unique nature of bard songs and skills... unless perhaps
you've already told them, or unless they're in the upper level ranges, in
which case they should have a least a passing familiarity with the way the
other classes work.

  Of course, I agree that it's generally a bad idea to order other members
in your group around, especially if you've never yourself played their class
to a similar level of experience. :)  Don't be too hard on them though.  I
know intellectually that bards make good groupmates, but for a while I was
sort of unenthusiastic about grouping with them because it made me feel
dumb. :P
