Listen  and listen well. At 16 I took my bard between unrest and
crushbone. I never seemed to have a problem getting in a throneroom
group or a death beetle/tormented dead group. Took a little over a
week and I dinged 19. At 19 I went to Paludal and dinged 20 in two
hours. Immediately go buy mana song and go back to Paludal, finding a
group is not hard at all when they realize you have said song. Stay in
Paludal until you are 23, and from there on you're on your own. I am
at 24 now and having a blast in Runnyeye.
