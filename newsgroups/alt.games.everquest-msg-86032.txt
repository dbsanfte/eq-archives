Not even close.  The first re-death, sure, but not a continuous loop of
re-deaths, un-doing months of playing for one stupid moment.

Order of the Mallet
--

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
