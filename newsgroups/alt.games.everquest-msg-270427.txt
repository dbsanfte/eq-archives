Well, I can understand how they have broken code (too many possible
situations to cover them all during Test), though I am often amazed
at just how basic some of the broken things are.

But as for rolling it out to all their servers, I think they're sort
of stuck with that situation.  Can you imagine the uproar if, say,
they rolled it out to 2-3 servers first, and waited a couple days to
see what bugs turned up before putting it up on the rest?  Players
on those servers would either be upset at the extra downtime, while
players on the other servers would be upset that there's new content
that other people are getting to explore first.  (Heck, wasn't a
couple days all it took for the first 65 Berserker to appear?  If
only some servers had berserkers available, the others would have
had players SCREAMING.)

Of course, there's also the logistics of having the patcher download
the new client without knowing yet which server you intend to connect
to.

I do admit I wonder what their patch process is like, that it takes
them 7 hours to install a patch to a patch to an update.
