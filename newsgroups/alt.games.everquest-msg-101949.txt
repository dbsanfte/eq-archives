Hi All

Here's my pennies worth over modem problems.

After 3 weeks of hair pulling as a newbie. I tried every suggestion from 
EverQuest tech support, my ISP, web pages & my phone company. To finally 
borrowing friends modems.

The problem was it was only EverQuest that caused trouble.

Unreal Tournament, Browsing  and normal downloads. No trouble 10 - 20 
hours on-line no problem. EverQuest 23mins was the longest I ever got

I finally cracked it. When I borrowed an Old fashioned Hardware Haynes 
modem, from work. The dropouts stopped.

While with Serial Conexant modem or PCI Conexant modems, they were 
better but still failed after 20 - 30 mins

I finally realised don't use anything that needs drivers to simulate 
parts of the modem system, especially any that simulate
UART's, why see Bill Gates!

But I swapped  my USB Conexant modem for an external US Robotics 
hardware serial port job, with a mate at work whose not interested in 
computer games.

I've gone from average of 10 to 15 minutes on-line before drop to not 
dropped in 3 hours of play.

So see you all there soon. I hope
