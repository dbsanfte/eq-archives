Since you don't want to buy them, some of them will drop. Jasper is low
level and I think it can drop off a ton of lowbie mobs. Just keep your
eyes open. I see a lot of rubies drop in Seb at the guardian camp. You
might try there. Occasionally off the seafurbies in OoT and the donosaur
there as well, but his loot table has been nerfed to crap so that's a
lot of work for a slim shot at a gem. I don't know that I've ever seen
platinum or velium bars drop in the game, but then again I wasn't really
looking for them either.
