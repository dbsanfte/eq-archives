Laugh about it or not it does violates the rules.  Isn't that the
point of those complaining about names that viaolate the policy?  A
play by the rules or get out sort of attitude.

Myself I say that if a name is not profain it doesn't bother me, and
I don't report it.  As in the lokari reference above there are so
many products and services out there world-wide in so many different
languages that I would guess that if a person wants to look long and
hard enough they can find a reason to petition most names in game.

What does get to me a bit is the numerous names of late that have a
sexual reference.  Not sure if they are gettin' plenty, gettin' none
or maybe just poorly supervised young people.  Either way there are
children in this game that should not be subject to that.  Also
(like in my case) an occasional grandchild sitting on grandpaws lap
asking a million questions.
