My guild was right in front of me when I popped into Kelethin for the first
time.  I made it as far as getting my first quest and some guild clothes,
then left the guild and walked right off a platform.  Never found my corpse
... ran around in my scivvies until someone had mercy on me and kindly
offered me some clothes.  I guess if you see a female wood elf running
around in the dark in panties and a bra, you just assume it's a newbie
