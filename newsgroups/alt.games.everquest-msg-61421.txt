I get them from "Wish I'd Said That"
http://home.earthlink.net/~davehill47/WIST/

I manually change them on mornings when I remember to do so. If you
browse there, be aware that the navigation design kind of sucks. The
almost invisible row of letters down the left hand column is actuall the
nav to get to the various pages of quotes by attributed source. The main
links in the middle of the front page only go to sub sections... more of
an "about this site" type of thing, and not the meat of the actual
quotes.
