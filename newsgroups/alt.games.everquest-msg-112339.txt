This is WHY we share accounts.  We both don't see the point in buying two
seperate games and two seperate accounts to play on ONE computer.  That's
rediculous.

And ACTUALLY... since we did just get our second computer built, my husband
is buying a new game, account, AND having all of his crap transferred for
the (outrageous) price of 50 bucks (well, character.. not all his crap).  I
think we're paying out too much friggen money for this damn game... which
we're gonna drop anyhow when Galaxies comes out.
