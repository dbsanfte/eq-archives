There was a rollover bug at one time (so I hear) but I can see no evidence 
of it now.  If there were a rollover bug, having a xR of 256 would be the 
same as having a resistance of 0.  As a bard, I play with resists a BUNCH, 
and I have seen NO difference between 250 and 260.  I can boost any given 
resist by at least 100 points, and am more than willing to test this with 
anyone on the Innoruuk server if you have an hour or two to kill.  
Based on my rather extensive personal experience raiding pretty much 
non-stop since level 50, I have seen NO evidence of a rollover bug with 
resists about 255.  Also, given the way that resists work, and the rather 
extensive number-crunching bards do to verify how certain songs work, I 
find the very absence of any evidence of a rollover bug a pretty 
conclusive statement that such a bug does not exist.
