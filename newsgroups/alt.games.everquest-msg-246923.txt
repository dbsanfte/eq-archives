I disagree here. LDoN's are different from classic dungeons due to the 
repop, but the addition of ojectives and time limits doesn't teach poor 
tactics... it teaches different tactics.

That is a good thing. Its only a bad thing when those are the only 
tactics one learns.

The real trouble is that there is no reason to leave LDoNs ... classic 
dungeons do not typically deliver the cash, xp, or potential item 
upgrades that LDoN adventures do... especially at the low to 
upper-middle game (20-55).

Even the new ZEM zones are still overall inferior to LDoN particularly 
in terms of gear...
