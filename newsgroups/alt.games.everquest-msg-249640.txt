Depends on level,until the classes get a lot of AAs,there is no
big difference in damage output,and even then the Pally will
outdamge the War when fighting undead;seeing a Pally slaying
undead in MMC makes my Ranger pale.
Oh and Pally gets nice undead weapon proc at 39,which does
unbeleivable 243 damage,for comparison Ranger 65 proc(working
on all mobs) does 150 damage.

Uland 65 Hunter
Meldore 53 Pally
