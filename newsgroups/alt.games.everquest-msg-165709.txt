I've played nigh on since release, with a few breaks. I've probably only
bothered , in that entire time, doing super long camps 3 or 4 times,
on a slow weekend, when I had little to do. Each time, I did it keeping
a friend company who also wanted something (for example, Lodizal), with
a book and television, occasionally gossiping online, occasionally just
killing time reading, watching TV, doing some housework with the sound
turned up so I could hear if anything happened.

Really, I have yet to see a stupidly long camp thats 'miserable' unless
people decide they HAVE to do it now, even though there are things they'd
rather be doing instead, that they are going to do it on their own, and
that they're going to sit glued to the screen for the entire (theoretical)
37 hours.

Frankly, anyone fitting that picture - solo, bored, doesnt want to be there,
has better things to do, and stays doing it for hours at a time - who then
complains that its an awful mechanic and they were obliged to do it has
none of my sympathy. EQ, at least for me, is a social game, and even
camping green green con shards for VT wasnt a trial, because I made sure
I had interesting company and interesting things to do.

Big whoop. I dont see the issue. I dont love camping rare mobs for 12 hour
stretches. Equally I dont love pressing 'a', sitting in silence watching
the screen until 'You have gained experience!' scrolls up, and repeating
that process for 12 hours at a time with occasional movement.

Its a game that requires user interaction, not a movie; it is what you make
it. I dont see why the 'camps' have to be any more or less boring than
any other part of it, and I suspect, given the popularity of lodi shields,
epics, etc, etc, and the number of happy customers that most people 
feel that way too. Just my opinion against yours of course, as neither of
us have surveyed a meaningful proportion of the player base.

Matt
