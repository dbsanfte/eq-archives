I must be the odd one out.  I don't mind working my way up through a
new character.  Started a necro a while back, and twinked nothing to
him for a long time (about Level 9, I think).  By the time I did so,
he already had over 100 Plat in the bank, just from killing and
looting everything that moves, and selling the stuff he got.  (Kill
every skeleton you see, you get LOTS of rusty weapons and bone chips.)

Of course, I also just had my Level 45 Paladin spend over a week in
Everfrost, slaughtering spiderlings and polar bear cubs wholesale.  It
takes a *lot* of kills to get supplies for 100 sets of leather
padding.  (I gave up on auctioning for the supplies; nobody pays any
attention unless you bid ridiculous amounts.)
