druids have been and most likely will continue to be completely broken. Yes
both druids and shamans should get cheal no later than lvl 44. Yes both
druids and shamans should get resurects no worse than paladins.

At level 34 a cleric can heal 6000 hps for 400 mana in under 15 seconds. A
level 60 druid can heal 1900 hps for 800 mana in the same time. Its not just
broke it is hugely broke.

On the other side of course we have adapted already, 1/6th of the raiding
class and above 50 crowd is already a cleric. The ridiculous broken healing
requirement has basically wiped out druids and proflagated clerics in huge
numbers. It may be too late to fix it now .
