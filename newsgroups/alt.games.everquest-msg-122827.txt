OK...everyone keeps telling me that have seen gnoll pelts.  I need  a ruined
blackborrow gnoll pelt to complete my warrior gauntlets, and have yet to
have seen ONE.  I've seen PLENTY of gnoll furs, gnoll pup scalps, high
quality gnoll furs, perfect gnoll skins, and flawless gnoll hides.  I've
checked the store near BB.  I've checked the stores in Qeynos.  I've looted
many dead gnoll corpses, within BB and without.  Can anyone tell me what
drops the gnoll pelt?  It's fraggin annoying!

Level 9 Human Warrior - Gonelen

Thanks,

JD
