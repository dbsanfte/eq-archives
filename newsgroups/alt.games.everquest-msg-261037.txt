Hm, level 58 cleric, 10 Jin shaman in old Seb...and collect 4 
lilys off them. I dont *think* I can really solo them. I would 
have to root and nuke, and hope for the best. I could sneak in a 
druid and DoT maybe...

Can't remember, do DoTs get attributed or are they free damage 
like damage shields?
