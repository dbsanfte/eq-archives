Lord Ghiosk or somesuch is the KOS one and drops some nice goodies.

Lord Rak Ashiir is the non KOS one. Dont mess with him unless you have
mages with firepets a lot of clerics and everyone out of his AoE range.

He has like a 1500pt fire based AoE that just *decimates* nice tightly
packed groups of tanks. You dont want to hit him if he pops - train 
everyone well, drum it into them, that they MUST see which ghost
name popped from the reaver before they hit attack adn if its him
immediately deselect him as a target and back off.
