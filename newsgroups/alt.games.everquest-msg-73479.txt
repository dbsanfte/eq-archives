Agreed. Just wish she would get anyother way of donating but Paypal.

Me and Paypal are not good friends, their system with activating an 
account with a number written on your next bank statement dont work if 
the bank  statement do not have numbers. Then you got a problem, mailed 
them and got told to just fax a copy of my credit card then they would 
activate it. Apart from lack of a fax i dont find that that very 
reassuring, so stopped trying to use them. Never got my 1$ back that 
they withdraw to register either, althought their webpage say you get it 
back.)

Hope shell get anyother way of donating too (amazon for example), then 
ill be happy to throw some money that way.
