I can't answer for him, but he voiced the same opinion as me, so I'll answer
from my viewpoint.

I prefer a challenge.  There IS no challenge to DAOC.   You fight...you
maybe die.  Oh well.   You don't get much xp back praying, so no reason for
a corpse recovery (errr, gravestone recovery).  No challenge plus a bitch of
an xp loss.

So not only do you have no challenge to keep your attention, you also lose a
depressing amount of time trying to earn back the experience lost.  Even if
you get to your grave, pray and make it out again you've still lost a couple
hours of work.

In EQ, yup, you may have to do a couple hour corpse recovery if your guild
isn't very experienced.   Hmmm, where did I just see "a couple hours"
mentioned....  Difference is, EQ is a challenge, DAOC is not.

So no, I don't purposely wipe out in EQ if no one dies...I consider it a
successful raid and a bonus.  It means we were up to the challenge.  Can you
say that about DAOC?  No.
