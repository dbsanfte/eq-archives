Same here, I don't see how you could twist 5 songs and have ALL 5 effects
going at the same time.  Just considering how long it takes to sing each
song tells me there would be at least momentary drop-offs in at least one
song's effect.  Not to mention if you ever miss a note.

I personally can twist 4 songs at higher levels when I've increased my
dexterity and I am a master at singing at all instruments.  Lower levels, as
I recently found out on the new server, are very difficult (esp. during
combat cause I get stunned so often) to twist 4 due to so many missed notes.
Sometimes I can get through a full cycle but it's much rarer than say level
30 and over.
