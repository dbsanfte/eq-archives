Hehe, gonna have alot of running to Halas if you go through Runnyeye.
The entrance to Halas lies in BlackBurrow, not Runnyeye. Runnyeye goes
to Xorb's Gorge.
The one REALLY bad thing I noticed about Runnyeye was the MOBs regen
factor. It's insane. If you don't kill something QUICKLY, expect a
long drawn out battle.
