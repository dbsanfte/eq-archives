Limited amount of X is insufficient content.  If X drops randomly from all
over the world, this problem doesn't exist.

For content to be sufficient, it needs to drop in more places than there are
campers.  Instancing is one way to do this, as each camper gets their own
specific drop place.  Having more spread out locations that drop it also
solves it.  Having high-reward items drop off of triggerable mobs also solves
it.

Camping and killstealing are caused by game design decisions about making
things (items, quests, xp spots, etc) rare by limiting the number of players
who can be doing them at a time.

Yes, there are (at least) two styles of instancing.  There's group-instancing,
where each player or group/raid gets an instance, and there's
world-instancing, where an area gets instanced as needed, but still throws
lots of people together.  Group instancing solves the camp/kill competition
problem.  World instancing solves some server-load problems.

Both do so at the "expense" of increased drop rates.  This is a sign of good
design, mostly because limited drop rates suck.  Other ways of increasing drop
rate solve the problem equally well, and retain the illusion of a consistent
single world.
