    Ok, now I got it.

    If you want the dungeon to be challenging to people, you can't tune it
to low DPS groups. You can make an "easy" setting, which they have done, but
even then you can't tune that setting to the lowest end of the "low"
spectrum. Especially not in Beta. The real groups going into these dungeons
post-release will have maps from various web sites, they'll have strategy
posts just like the ones on the trials, they'll have every advantage when it
comes to information about the encounter. If they're going to be challenged,
then a group without such knowledge (like the beta testers) should have to
be very competent and well-built to beat the same encounter.

    Or, it'll be like the Justice trials. These trials will seem extremely
hard based on tight time limits when LDoN first comes out. People will start
gravitating to the easiest dungeons for a given level of reward, vainly
trying to complete things tuned for people who have put more time into
developing their characters and gameplay. There will, of course, be player
bitching. Three to six months down the road, nothing will have changed about
the dungeons, but full spoilers will have been released and those combined
with advances in player power and knowledge will allow anyone to get through
the previously "impossible" dungeons.

    The true casual gamer is a myth. There's the powergamer, the
time-starved powergamer, and the occasional player. The powergamer will
complete LDoN without issue. The time-starved powergamer will bitch up a
storm, but he always bitches up a storm and then shuts up as soon as he
achieves whatever artificially high goal he's set for himself. The
occasional gamer has a ton of content to consume before he can honestly say
"been there, done that, I need more".
