 And this happens to you a lot elsewhere? I've been playing this game a
fairly long time and I've never had a higher level try to KS me or steal
my camp. Although I'll grant the fact that on new zones everything seems
to die rather quickly and perhaps not everyone is as nice as they
normally would be. This is why I wouldn't mind the Trivial Loot Code on
new zones if it wasn't a permanent thing. I could understand it's
purpose a lot more if it was on zones for 2-3 months and then removed.

  Yeah, thanks Verant! I haven't been there myself (and don't intend to)
but from those I've heard from so far they report back greeny aggro,
annoying trains, and buggy/incomplete quests. Thank god you spent all
that time making it right before bringing it live (and late). At least
you got your precious TLC right and that's the most important part.
