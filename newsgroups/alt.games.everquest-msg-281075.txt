Heh, no worries - it's a perfectly reasonable question  :)  Now, don't
get me wrong here - I'm talking generalizations, and there will be
servers/zones that are the exception to the rule, but.... Essentially,
getting groups is *damn* hard work these days  - no matter what level
you are or what zone you're in.

The people you see in zones these days are (usually) either wanting to
solo or are just passing through to some other zone where they want to
solo. The reason for this is that all the fresh new content and
interesting stuff released (up to now) is always  designed for
ever-higher levels of characters. So to get their hands on it, players
are  "blitzing" their xp by soloing (virtually constantly) with
sackloads of healing potions, as twinked and as buffed as they can
possibly be.  This is why entire zones are just empty wildernesses
now.  (I remember when you had to queue up for a camp spot in zones
like East and West Commonlands, South Karana, Highold Keep, Great
Divide, Ocean of Tears... you name 'em. Still, that's another topic)
Now, the content, loot and mobs in zones like these is stale, boring
and unchanging. With some exceptions, the majority of loot in the
majority of zones is hardly even worth the bother of picking up!

Now, for the DoN stuff, you'll find that on my server it's an even
worse situation - the high-level types who embark on the missions do
so purely to get Crystals to sell for lots of plat. There are players
in PoK touting hundreds of them, sometimes. I *have* asked people for
a group by tell, etc., but they have no real interest in sharing their
loot and xp with a lower-level player who is just slowing them down.
Without getting in a group for a while, I reckon even just getting the
required faction is going to be a long, long job.
