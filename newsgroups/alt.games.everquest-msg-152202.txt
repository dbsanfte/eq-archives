I voted for them to give my little sister's Ken doll a penis.

I mean, that anatomical plastic mons pubis is fine on a
prepubescent doll of a girl, but on a supposedly grown
man?  I mean, the most disturbed I think I was when I
was a lil' boy was seeing her Ken doll naked and thinking
that when I was grown up my twig and berries would
magically fall off.

Oh, wait...that WAS one of the choices, wasn't it?

*voted for new content...any glaring fixes can normally
be add-ins to a scheduled new content patch, anyways...
and I don't want a shadow...something new to calculate
and slow Shar Vahl down even further....
