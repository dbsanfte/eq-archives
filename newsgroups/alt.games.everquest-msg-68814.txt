There was no fucking point to it BEFORE the nerf.  Level 9 (for rangers)
snare was only barely slower to cast and lasted 3 minutes fixed.  TW on
castersrealm implied 1 minute fixed...big freaking deal.

I'm sorry, but if you rangers are going to wait until the critter is within
1 minute of death to cast a snare-type spell, you're going to have a hell of
a lot of runners.  And if you cast even SNARE after level 50 there's a
decent chance in many groups that the sucker is going to wear off early.

Rangers snaring is a joke.  They have other things to do.  You use a ranger
to snare if you have no druid, but druids are definitely preferred.
