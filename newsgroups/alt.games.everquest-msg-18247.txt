Yup:  "/loc" accesses the tinkered navigation satellites that
the Gnomes launched in 2425.

More seriously, I think the point of the "automapping" is that
(as in most games that provide such a feature) the idea is
that your character would be making notes as he travelled (or
has a good memory for geography), and would thus have
self-written maps with him after he has been to an area at
least once.

This helps remove some of the tedium that the "where the
hell am I" aspect adds to a lot of games.  I have an
excellent sense of direction myself (I've often entered
a zone, eyeballed a direction, hit autorun, and gone to
the kitchen, only to return and find myself exactly
where I had been aiming at, like right in the middle of
the exiting zone tunnel), but I really feel for the people
who don't.  My wife gave her Ranger the surname "Needsamap"
(the game wouldn't accept "Lostalot").

If Automapping is strictly against The Vision(tm), it might
be nice to add something like an expensive tinkered
magical item that would support some sort of enhancements
for the directionally-challenged.

Also note that /loc itself is also against The Vision
(Verant had it in as a debug tool, and was going to
remove it after Beta, but the players screamed because
it would leave way too many people totally lost and
floundering).  Sometimes compromises have to be
made between design idealism, and utter frustration.
