I refused to choose a last name back when you *couldn't* change it - one bad
divorce will do that to ya.  I still wouldn't pick one if it had to be
"forever".
I just recently decided on the surname for my level 51 ranger:  Skila
Windrunner.
My level 32 druid will probably be Jennaii Dawnrunner.
My level 29 shaman:  Linni Mistrunner.
When my Vah Shir beastlord is old enough she will be Spookiti Fogrunner (or
Fogfeet..."The fog comes on little cat's feet...." can't decide).
Can you tell I'm a runner in *this other world*?
