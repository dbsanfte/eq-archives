I do but you are going to need to do some faction work first.
Start in Black Burrow, kill gnolls (and collect the fangs) nothing much
going to bother you there, you are only there for faction. When you are no
longer KoS to guards (This doesn't take as long as you might think, I did it
with my Dark Elf SK) hand any fangs you have to Capt Tillin in the Arena in
Sth Qeynos. You'll need some a few empty slots for this is because he'll
give you a moonstone in return and although the Fangs stack the moonstones
don't. Give these to Mcneal Jocub in the back of Fish Ales (also in Sth
Qeynos) this will give you faction with the Priests of Life and the Knights
of Thunder (Pally Guild) you want to get to dubious with the paladins, this
may take a while, I used Wolf form to leapfrog that part, in the end.

The money making part;
In W. Karanas there are numerous bandit camps, with the exception of
Brigands (who will aggro anyone) they will not aggro you, slaughter them,
the humans (and sometimes Barbarians) drop bronze weapons and the humans
also drop sashes, these you hand in to Chesgard in the Paladin guild (again,
Sth Qeynos) for this you will get some gold, some exp and a bronze weapon or
shield, as well as more faction. When hunting try and have as much pack
space free as possible, sashes do not stack :�(

CONS;
As with any farming, it's tedious but you can make 150pp or so in 2hrs if
you control the Farm, the mountain camp and the valley spawns all near the Q
Hills zone, remember, farmers that shelter the Bandits drop sashes too.
You will wreck your faction with the Bloodsabres in the Qeynos Sewers but as
they start as Dubious to you, they aren't much use anyway, be warned there
is a group of NPC's on the Nrth Wall of the zone who all for under this
faction (Bard Epic I believe)

PROS;
Don't know any better way for a low 20's character to make money.
You WILL still get exp for the sashes being handed in.
You will gain faction with Qeynos and Highpass Guards not to mention Karana
residents and Priests of Life (this means Rinna Lightshadow will be your
friend and not slaughter you when some idiot trains to the tunnel in EC)
