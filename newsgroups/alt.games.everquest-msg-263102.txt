If I'm the main healer in a group, I always ask what their HP is, unless 
it's someone I already know.  I don't do it prior to an invite, I just like 
to know when I should think about healing him.  I do not ask about AC or AA 
or such.  If I am not the main healer, I don't bother asking anyone much of 
anything about their AC/HP/AA/Mana pool, I just switch what I am doing as 
needed based on how things are going.
