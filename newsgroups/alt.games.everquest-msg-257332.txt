It's easy to think that.  But the number is probably accurate.  The ZEM is 
proportional to the amount of exp you get per MOB of a given level.  Go 
kill 10 even cons (and nothing else) in Loio, measure XP bar movement, 
then go kill 10 even cons in... oh, what's the same level and 75 ZEM?  
South Karana maybe?  With the same character.  I bet you, your exp bar 
moves further in SK.  However, it'll probably take you significantly less 
time to kill those ten mobs in Loio, because (especially between the late 
teens and mid-20's) most mobs there seem to be somewhat overconned, so 
despite the low ZEM, the exp you get per HOUR is significantly better.  
That may be less true for the experiment, since sorting out ten of -just- 
the even cons is probably harder in the chaotic wandering-mob morass that 
is Loio.
