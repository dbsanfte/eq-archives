I like HE as a wiz, but to each his own.  HE is great for most trade
skills except tinkering.  I love my wizard but beware it is a tough
class to play in the long run.  We are very one dimensional.  We nuke,
that's it.  Ports are just gravy, not defining as Verant would have
you believe.

As for good starting characters, I would recommend wood elf druid or
Iksar Necromancer.  Iksar Necro is TOUGH level 1-4 but gets SOoooooo
much easier after that.  Once you get your skills up a bit its a VERY
fun class.  Lots of diversity, and can solo amazingly and even decent
in a group.

Druids are fun at low levels, diverse skills.

5ht level is a minimum, prolly even better at 10.

Neutral traders, and its where most servers host their daily/weekly
bazaar.
