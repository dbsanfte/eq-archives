Cool, but a higher DEX does increase the proc rate as I understand it.

Sorry, you're gonna have to spell out the significance of this little
fact. I'm occasionally obvious point challenged.

It still just seems to me that a wizard is best utilized as a DD
nuker, taking any downtime to med as necessary (and when nuking, it is
always necessary). It the group is handling all pulls without even
breaking a sweat, however, I suppose it's quite expected that one
might break from the norm and enjoy something a bit different.
