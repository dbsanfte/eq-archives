As someone who only plays EverQuest at the moment and has been very 
interested in this AO trial thing, I am really glad you posted this 
here. I think this is very relavant info for the likes of EQ players who 
spend a lot of time at this sort of game and now have the opportunity to 
try for free something very different. So thank you for initiating this 
discussion here.

I had to work all weekend as I am a nurse but the sweet thing about the 
schedule I do is that I am rewarded for this with most weekdays off. So 
I have the time for more than one MMO and have been thinking about 
playing something else for fun. Now along comes AO at no cost. How can I 
resist? I've followed its progress from afar on Gamespot and noted how 
far they have come and that some people really love the game as it has 
turned out with time. I've also noted it may be the most complex MMORPG 
out there and so I come to it expecting a learning curve. But to me a 
game with depth is fun. It wouldn't be much fun if all could be known in 
a month's time or less.

So I've downloaded and installed it too. I also got my best friend to do 
the same so we can try it out together. He's never played an MMORPG 
before but he does like single player RPGs and shooters. So it should be 
fun for me coming from EQ and fun for him experiencing this kind of game 
for the first time, although I hope the complexity of this one doesn't 
put him off. We're going to wander through character creation and 
starting out together while on the phone with each other and then drop 
the phone once we've got in game communication. Although I'm thinking 
that using Teamspeak together while we play might be good fun but now 
that is quite off topic so I'll say no more...

I don't know as I care to bother with reading the manual but I will read 
the character creation section. I have a Gamespot guide for the game too 
I think or maybe it's a link to it online. I'll peruse the character 
creation info there too before I dive in.

I am happy to hear there are melee, pet and magic classes, all of which 
I'd like to try. Although I don't know what I was else I should have 
expected from an MMORPG. LOL! It's just that given the entirely 
different world of this game I don't know what to expect. But that is 
fun in itself to me.

Is there a healer class in the game? My main in EverQuest is a 65 Cleric 
and I like playing a healer. I guess it's the nurse in me that draws me 
to that. If only I could cast CH's in real life. I hope there is some 
equivalent to the cleric class. I'd like that, even though I am very 
interested in playing something different for a change too.

I'm hoping my friend and I may take the plunge tonight after he's home 
from work. I'll be following this thread with great interest and post my 
own impressions when I've jumped in myself.
