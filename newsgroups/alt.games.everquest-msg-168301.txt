Yes, a wandering Bulthar walks past succor landing zone every couple minutes
or so. There are also two animals there, an Elephant and Walrus. The animals
are usually indiff to passers-by, but they WILL aggro on you if the
Bulthar - who is KOS - aggro's.

Sooo, just be ready to run. SG doesn't allow lev, so SoE is stripped on zone
in. When you land, a small turn to the right and go. The tunnel turns left
and voila! You are in WW. No probs, just turn right and go when you land.
