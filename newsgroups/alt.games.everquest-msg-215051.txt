Can't play 2 hours a day isn't a casual player.   2 hours a day is an "ultra
casual" player.   This was a legitimate complaint when they were only adding
content that could be done in multi-hour raids.  For this, it sounds like
just whining.  If you can't play in a two hour stretch, you already weren't
doing much except soloing.

Heh.  Permacamped spots where you have to wait hours to squeeze your group
in are your idea of the "best thing for casual players"?    By the time they
got thier turn there and started killing, they would need to leave.   If
they ever made it that long.

Definitely.  It's a move very much in the other direction.    The hardest
part of playing in a dungeon, the time when you were usually in the most
danger, was the initial break of the area.  Once things had been killed, you
could sit there and calmly kill the respawns all day.   In an LDoN dungeon,
nothing respawns, and you have to keep moving, so you're constantly having
to break the next area.   This is much more difficult.   I don't even see
how you can possibly get "dumbing down of the game" from this expansion.

That would be the camping and killstealing, yes?   If getting away from that
is making it "become Diablo" then long live Blizzard.
