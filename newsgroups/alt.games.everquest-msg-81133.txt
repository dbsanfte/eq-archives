Yeah, have had a pair for over 6 months.  The absolutely best possible
instrument for a bard.  It's the only one I alwasy use, even with my
epic.  The percentage bonus is an additional 55% on top of the normal
instrument bonus.  To demonstrate how much of a difference it is, I'll
use the level 9 song, Elemental Rhythms.  Singing it without an
instrument boosts MR/FR/CR for your group by 34 points.  Singing it
with a store-bought drum increases it 61 points.  Singing it with
Drums of the Beast increases your resists by 88 points.  
When this first came out there was a problem with Selos because it
boosted run speed past the maximum speed the game allowed.  The fix
was to have Selos just not work if you had DotB equipped, which was a
real pain while kiting, but about 6 weeks ago they changed it.  Now I
can run at 256% of normal run speed, which is pretty damn fast.
(Maybe 10-12 minutes including zoning time from DL spires to Seb
sphere.)
