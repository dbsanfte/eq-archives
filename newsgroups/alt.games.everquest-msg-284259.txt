Ah, PoK is a much more typical place for your "bind spot", i.e. the
place you go when you die.  (As mentioned before, you can change
where that is, but PoK is most people's top choice because it's safe
and has access to lots of recovery options.)

But PoK is not "on the moon".  It's a separate plane of existence, or
some such mumbo-jumbo.  The reason for making the distinction is that
it was entirely possible that you WERE on the moon.  The zones that
are part of the "Shadows of Luclin" expansion really are on the moon.
In some of zones there, you can even look up and see the planet Norrath
overhead (it looks quite impressive :-), so I thought you might have
seen that and thus deduced you were on the moon!
