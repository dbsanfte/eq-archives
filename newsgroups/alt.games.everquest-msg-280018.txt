-Guess you can do the maths yourself,PR is a huge mana waster-


As Lief wrote it's not a matter that CH is not godly, but more so that
your MA will die on certain named if you don't use faster heals. Keep
in mind that with qvic gear (namely arms) which are generally easy to
aquire now and the correct healing focus Pious Remedy can be crit for
7100. 

What would be preferable? Healing your tank for 7kish or not healing
them at all causing the group to potentially wipe?
