I was bound in FM at the zoneline to OT. Was hunting in OT and a guildie
asked for help in Guk. I was getting bored in OT anyway so I decide to take
the boat (no porters around). Being a high elf I am not wanted in the
outpost. I cast invis and run up to the docks, totally ignoring anything
around me. All of a sudden I get hit, invis drops and a lot of adds take me
down.
I just forgot there were undead in the outpost :/

Another time in OT. I solo animals a bit near the ledge. Damshield pet,
malise mob, send pet in, rain-nuke mob, wait till it's dead.
Having a go for some time, then someone shouts "Goon to ledge!". An
instinctive reaction makes me cast invis on myself. Moving away from the
ledge and then get ready to take some more animals down. I shoot a malise at
a tiger and press my pet attack hotkey. "You have no pet to command."
"Oh crap" I think, remembering I forgot to recast pet. I run to the ledge
and to a few players there. Asking for help they all assist me and the tiger
goes down fast.
Being hurt a lot I decide to med and heal up a bit there. All of a sudden
"Dragoon xxxx hits YOU for 90 damage."
...
Needless to say: I died.

I totally forgot the goon and missed the fact that all the players on the
ledge were evil characters :/
