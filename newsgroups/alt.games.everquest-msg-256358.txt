How do you get 3x/2 + x/2?

I take .5x stunning one mob

I take .5x fighting one mob while stunning it, but the other mob does x 
damage since its not being stunned.  This means while killing the first 
mob I take x+.5x=1.5x.  Then I still have to kill the second mob, chain 
stunning him, which takes .5x.  Total 1.5x+.5x=2x.  Thats four times 
.5x, which is my normal damage taken per kill, divide by two (cause I 
killed two mobs) and I get x per kill, twice what I normally spend... 
which is what you said.

Hmm, 1.5x=3x/2 stupid.  Just looked weird when you put it that way.

I take three times as much damage while the I have two mobs on me, then 
regular damage while killing the second.

This really points up how much having a chanter along helps me out, not 
only do I get haste to kill faster and slow to take less damage, but I 
also get to fight only singles, ever, without having to deal with zoning 
out in order to clear aggro, and without having to be nearly as careful 
to do single pulls.
