Not sure if this applies, but earlier in the Enchanting life, you get a 
haste spell ( Alacrity at 24 ) and then Augmentation at 29.  Most of the 
tanks I dealt with always wanted Alacrity because it had more haste and 
they usually didn't know what Aug did.  Aug maxes at 10% less haste then 
Alacrity ( or 75% of Alacrity's haste ), but addes AC, AGI and Stamina 
Regen

Unless I just had a ton of spare mana, they got what I deemed better.  Aug 
adds more stats than just haste and lasts longer.  I would normally haste 
damage dealers and Aug the MA.  It was totally situational based on group 
makeup, mana pool, etc.  I don't let a Warrior dictate what buffs I cast, 
typically, unless they can provide good reason for me to sway from my 
decision.  I'm not close-minded, but I am almost always a better enchanter 
than the guy playing the tank.

I find myself using different tactics based on the Clerics mana pool.  If I 
am always FM and they are 50m, I will do things differently than if I am 
normally 50m and the CLC is FM all the time.  That's what I like about the 
game - the way every day has a different strategy beased on all the 
factors.
