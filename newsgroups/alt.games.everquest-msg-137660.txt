I've had a great time partnering my bard with my friend's monk.

Like the classic shaman partner, bard provides haste and slow,
but also has the often vital snare capability shaman lacks.

Bard also has some mez and charm for crowd control

And has sufficient weapon and armor capability to act as
a second tank, all you need to do is FD to hand over the
MA reins, get back up (unless so low HP that you will
get HP aggro) and go back to work while the bard soaks
damage for a while.

Bard has.. well I can't call it healing, honestly.  But a very
nice regen indeed.  And of all the melee classes, monk
is the one that can afford to do without a healer, regen
generally gets the job done quite well.  Make sure the bard
soaks some of the damage as well, so you get twice the
milage out of the regen.

When you pick up a third member of the party, the bard will
probably change duties but still be able to provide something
vital, even in a full group a bard will have at -least- melee
plus regen that stacks with other regen and mana regen that
stacks with other mana regen.  If there is a hole of some kind
other than that the bard can probably fill it in... but those particular
duties will work in almost any group.

Problems:  Well, no real healer.  And while bards can do a wide
variety of things they are limited as to the number of things they
can do at any one time.  If the bard has to keep mobs mezzed, this
will probably end up being all they do.  Haste/Slow+snare/HP regen
is the most common combo with a monk partner, and anything else you
try to do takes away a leg from that tripod... of course you have
five slots to load other songs in so you can switch jobs on the fly,
but that trio is so effective with a monk that you'll really feel it every

time you have to depart from it.  Learning to guage whether you can
take mobs given what the bard can sing is something your monk will
have to put more effort into than most partnerships would entail.

Also, no porter.  With the advent of Luclin, this lack isn't as annoying
as
it once was.

Llyric, 40 bard, Morell Thule

PS I advise looking for a primary equippable lute to make this really
work, as this allows you to easily juggle in strings on the fly for better

HP regen while keeping up your melee contribution.  Vah Shir get
a primary lute as part of their lowbie quest cycle... otherwise you'll be
spending a pretty penny on a Lute of the Howler or something like that.
