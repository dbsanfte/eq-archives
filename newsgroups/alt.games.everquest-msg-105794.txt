was fighting with my 18 warrior in oasis for a while (up to 18 that's is)
then decided I wanted to explore and ran all the way to Qeynos (big mistake
I think) I am looking for a good place to hunt where there are actually
people. tried west karana, everfrost, bb(not much exp there for me) and cant
find enough ppl to form a group in any of them have managed to find small 2
or 3 groups in west karana but am surprise that there is not many more ppl
in there.
am playing ayonae ro server btw.
