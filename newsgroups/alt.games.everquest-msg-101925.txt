As always, the power belongs to the beholder, but atleast these people are
making an effort towards manners .... look further down. posts about people
who don't say please (or pls or plz ) at all ...... I personally get a
different vibe from someone who says 'Sow plz' to someone who says 'you got
sow? can i have it !' ... but hey only MHO.

Don't flame Trollers, just /ignore !
