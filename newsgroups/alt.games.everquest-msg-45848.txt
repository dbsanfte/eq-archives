amen! Don't think anything is in place to determine if you are idle or
not, so they prolly won't add that.  But leadership should change when
leader goes LD, and if they add SuperGroups (groups of groups for
raids), then they will HAVE to automatically change leadership.
Imagine trying to reinvite 30 people, sheesh.

Currently leave group when LD. Also I can see jerks sending people all
over the world.

You don't?  Never noticed.  Do you even stand up if you are medding?
I know now when you become linkdead everything instantly goes to
"indifferent" unless you are already on thier hate list. So while
linkdead nothing can jump you.

HELL YEAH! Now it gives the loc if you go LD while zoning and end up
"under the world" and have to be sent to safe spot, would be easy to
add this one.
