I've done all of the following at times with my cleric:

low-40s	- tree spectre in feerrott (slow)
low-40s	- happ in lesser feydark (beefier version of cynthia)
mid-40s - aquagoblins in lake of ill manners (pull in pairs, extremely low hp)
mid-40s - trak teeth spectres (easy single-pulls)
high-40s - plaguebone thief pyramid in dreadlands (slow, easy single-pulls)
