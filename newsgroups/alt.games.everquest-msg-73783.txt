The best "general" AA I see on the list for a cleric is Run.  Yes, I know,
you doubtless have TBoots or JBoots already, and usually group with
a SOWer anyway.... but none of those can be cast inside.  Being able to
move faster than 99% of mobs always?  Sounds loads better to me than
the few extra mana points you can squeeze out of the boost to wis.

On the other hand, one AA point is roughly equal in Exp cost to all of level
51.  Two AA points?  You could be 53 and well on your way to level 54
instead of having 4 more points of wisdom.  The higher your level the less
meaningful the exp you throw at AA would have been in terms of leveling.

My suggestion would be to wait till 54 plus enough exp to not lose level
on death, then pump 100% into AA until you get a point of run, then
go back to putting just a trickle into AA, say 20%.  Object being to
get to 55 with 6 AA under your belt, so you can go for mana regen,
which apparantly stacks with clarity, right away.
