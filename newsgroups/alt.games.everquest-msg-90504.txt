The Springwood Club is what I use, or rather used, to melee on stuff
that was running away at your level too.  I still got it, and
sometimes still use it to beat on deep, deep green mobs.  But once you
get 49 and become really, really addicted to Quad Kiting, weapons will
become more useless than they are now.  Still, I got my 1hb, offense,
AND defense all maxed out.  :-)

Beating on runner isn't a bad thing.  Still, I prefer the AC.
Especially when you start going up against mobs that, if you don't
stay outta arms reach, can quad you for 100 a pop.

>Is there something I could be doing differently? (Wis 199, +224 mana adds)

Not really.  Not yet.  I personally prefer the extra AC, but I don't
think this is one of those "there's only one way to do it" kinda
things.
