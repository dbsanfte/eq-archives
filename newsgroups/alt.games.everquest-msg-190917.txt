I think you should explore deeper.  I'm the first to proclaim that there are
some funky bugs, but for the most part the way exp works is pretty
consistent (until you get to raids and multiple groups when it can start to
flake out pretty badly).

When you taunted the mob off, you pressed the taunt key only, right?  Did
you riposte?  Were they DS'ed?  Were you?  Did they manage to do any damage
at all to the mob?  Did you remember to disband from the group so they could
get exp (oh I hate doing this one, especially if I'm in a groove and forget
to disband for several kills)?  Many possibilities.

I know for a fact, because I've done it, that I can hold aggro 100% on a mob
with my ranger just chain casting snare and newbies can beat it down and
will get th exp.

Yeah...  you drop off the hate list while feigned, but you also remove
credit for damage done (there are caveats to this that I learned through
monk PL'ing a few characters).

I have a whole stable of 50s characters, a lot have been PL'ed through at
least some of that (also have a growing stable of 60s charactes).  I have
probably the only alteration spec'ed wizard in existence.  :)  Believe me,
you are wrong and it's probably from missing some key piece of info, some
possibilities of which I pointed out above.
