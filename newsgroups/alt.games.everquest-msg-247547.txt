Well if I read the post right he WAS the first one there and was already
killing when the others came in.
However, I, too, get irritated when high levels camp green zones.
That said, I would still have given up the camp to those who were level
appropriate.  
Of course the *obvious* thing to do, since they were LFM, would have been to
bring on the little guy and join their group.
Once everyone starts waving their .... swords .... around, it's usually not
going to end amicably.
