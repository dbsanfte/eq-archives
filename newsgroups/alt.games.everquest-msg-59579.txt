1. I combined enough silk thread to make silk bandages. Are silk bandages used
for Bind Wounds, or can I actually make something out of them? I tried
combining them with a pattern, and it said they couldn't be combined in the
sewing kit....

2. What kind of material do I need to make (or buy) to make raw silk armor? And
how much silk thread do I need to combine to make the material (I combined 3
silk threads to get silk bandages)?
