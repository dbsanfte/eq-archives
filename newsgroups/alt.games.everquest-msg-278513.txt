But for an enchanter to reliably get groups in these zones, you need a mez 
spell that works on the mobs here.
SOE made this mez spell the *third* spell we get, so its catch 22.
You cant get a group in this zone without the mez spell (unless you have 
friends to "carry" you), and you cant get the mez spell without a group.
