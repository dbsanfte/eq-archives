First off, most of those people are probably twinks (meaning they did what
you are talking about....getting a character high enough and outfitting
lower characters).  If you wanted, you could try the Stromm server since
unless people are already way up in levels on that server, there are gonna
be a lot more first time characters on there.  But if you want to stay on
the server you're on, here are my two suggestions to get some money.
Nothing great, but will fund your spells at least and maybe a few equipment
upgrades......

Take your ranger to either the Karanas or the Commons and track spiders,
anything but spiderlings.  Farm spider silks and sell them in the bazaar for
5-10pp each depending on the prices on your server.  That's up to 200pp for
each stack and you can get a stack in about 30 minutes if you're lucky.

Second (and this requires a bit of an initial investment but still can net
some good cash)......Vials of Prismatic Dye.

Here are the steps that I took....

1. Go to PoK and buy stacks and stacks of water flasks.  Then find the gnome
merchant that is by the other bank in PoK that nobody uses and buy stacks
and stacks of fishing grubs.  Find a brew barrel that is open and combine
one each till your wrist starts cramping out.  Combines to make some kind of
putrifying essence or some such thing, basically vendor it or destroy it,
your choice.  This trivials somewhere above 100 so more than enough to get
past the 68 trivial for the final combines of Vials.
2. Also in PoK or wherever else you want to do pottery.... follow this
guide:
http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_pottery2.htm
Will get you to 122 if you want to take it that high, but just need 54 for
the vials.
3. Go to Gulf of Gunthak and purchase 1 each dye vial, quality firing sheet,
prism shard and glaze laquer.  Can all be bought from the erudite vendor in
the lighthouse.  Make sure you have some items that raise your charisma to
at least 106 (Opal Encrusted Steins go for around 15-25pp or so, get two of
these and even the ugliest ogre can have decent charisma).  Then find a kiln
in Gunthak (nearby around one of the little huts) and combine the vial and
the firing sheet.  Then a brew barrel, combine the prism shard and glaze
laquer.  Then combine the results of both of those combines also in a brew
barrel.  With good charisma will cost you about 31pp a combine and when I
looked in the bazaar, lowest price I saw was 50pp for them, so I can move
about 5 stacks overnight priced at 45pp so that's profit of 14pp each
combine.

Initial Investement should be at most around 80pp or so, and after that you
can start making money rather quickly.  I'm 52 and I still make these things
to make some extra cash on the side.

Other ideas for less but quicker cash without much investment is to kill
wisps (with any character above level 10 with a weapon that is classed as
Magic) and loot Lightstones and Greater Lightstones.  Vendor the lightstones
and turn the GLS's into either the gypsy camp in NK (if you're a good race)
or the one in Oasis if you're evil for a book that you can turn around and
vendor for 9pp each.

Another idea, depending on how comfortable you are with soloing is to go to
the caves outside Dalnir's in Warslik's Woods (www.eqatlas.com for maps of
how to get there) and solo the brutes that are there.  Not gonna be great xp
at your level, but they drop some gems that sell for a few plat, and the HQ
Brute Hides are used for Halfling Cultural Armor and go for 50-90pp or more
in the bazaar depending on how patient you are.  I leveled there from about
25-30 with my Beastlord and made around 300pp every few hours or so.  Just
root/rot them and you'll be fine, though I've never soloed them with a
shaman.

Anyway, none of these ideas will make you uber or rich, but it's a place to
start.  Good luck.
