Letting a pharmeceutical company outright *profit* from experimental 
drugs is preying on their desperation to survive. If I come up with a 
concoction of herbs and minerals and claimed it *may* be a cure for 
cancer... its illegal for me to wander around selling it to desperate 
people in exchange for their life savings for a damned good reason.

Back to the point though...It doesn't have to be a cure for cancer 
though... a cure for the common cold will suffice for my example and is 
more suitable. I still shouldn't be allowed to charge you to test it for 
me. (Nor 'bundle' it with the poorly selling cereal Pfizer-O's)

Brilliant marketing.

I'm not sure I called its outright 'unethical' (maybe i did?) But that's 
not the point. On some level some products shouldn't be brought to 
market prematurely, even if there is a 'demand' for them, even if the 
buyers are well informed. (Drugs were my first example, but it applies 
to everything from drugs to toys to electronics to gillette mach 3 
shavers) I think beta software shouldn't either.

Society as a whole doesn't benefit from companies selling products too 
poor to be considered by the company itself to be a finished product. 
Virtually every other product as complicated as a peice of software must 
go through rigourous external approval processes before it can be 
brought to market... maybe its time for software too. But that's a big 
can of worms all on its own.

Just because you *can* whip up the consumers into a frenzy to buy 
something, and then sell it to them doesn't necessarily mean you should 
be allowed to do it.
