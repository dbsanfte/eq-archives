Well he was a level 13, not a heavily twinked noob like you seem to have
thought. I got donated some armor by a kind stranger and the rest of the
pieces I worked my butt off to get, as with the weapon. I spent the 4 days
working on another character so my ACCOUNT was online, just not that
character. If someone in my house knows my password (which I'm not denying
could have happened although I don't have it written down anywhere) they
aren't fessing up. And he isn't part of a guild that could help re-outfit
him.
In any case, whether it was someone in my house, a hacker, or whatever the
reason, I still think it STINKS. He was my first ever EQ character. I only
started playing in November. Someone said I could get everything back in a
second??? HA it took me months of a lot of fighting and looting to get what
I got. I don't have any UBER twinks. The rest of my characters (I have 3
total) are in mix matched armor that I buy and upgrade piece by piece as I
can afford to. One day maybe I'll have a high level character with mega plat
to spare and can outfit the new ones right off but that isn't the case now.
So if I can get everything back in a second would someone kindly show me
how? I don't know enough dirty EQ cheat secrets to even be ABLE to twink
someone.
...and I have changed my password again just to make sure if it was someone
here or a hacker in my account that it won't happen again.
Regardless... I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO LOSE MY STUFF. I did not press /q
which I didn't even know you could do until today, and I didn't walk away
while he was camping. I went from him to my (now level 15) ranger and he was
safely camped next to Kanthuk Ogrebane when I did so. No mobs there... just
was waiting for them to fix the Ghoulbane quest so I could turn in the note
to him and get the pendant. I already had the blade of nobility part to the
quest from some kind person who let me loot it off a crazed goblin earlier
that day... of
course also gone... so there went 2 parts of the Ghoulbane quest as well.

Ankylbytr - Dwarf Paladin lvl 13 (stripped naked now)
Kluamian - Wood Elf Ranger lvl 15
Moonzephyr - Erudite Enchantress lvl 9
Mithaniel Marr server

And judging from the posts I have seen I'm sorry if the name Ankylbytr
offends you... He was my first character and I've seen tons of names like
Shadowstalker and Snowalker and Toenibblah and stuff like that and the
halfling names in Rivervale are ridiculous so I'm still
not sure if Ankylbytr's name is in violation or not.
