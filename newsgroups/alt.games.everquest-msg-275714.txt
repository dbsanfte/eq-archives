When I was playing Hartwin, my dwarven cleric (gave him up for personal 
reasons at season 57), he was quite capable of soloing blues in PoJ, the 
Hole, Eastern Wastes, and several other areas. Was quite good against both 
undead and living opponents. Sylavel, Hartwin's replacement (high elf cleric 
that I grew bored with and gave up at season 49), was never quite as good at 
soloing as Hart, but could do it reasonably well.
