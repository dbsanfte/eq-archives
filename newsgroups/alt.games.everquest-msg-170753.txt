I was soloing the giant fort in DL today for cash.  I was charm kiting and
occasionally pulling the whole fort to the fairly clear area over the hill
to chant-kite the whole lot silly while trying to not make myself dizzy from
running circles when I noticed that one of the giants was using another as a
human shield.  I thought this was strictly for melee attacks.  Am I wrong or
was this probably just a small bug in the AI?

Sean...
