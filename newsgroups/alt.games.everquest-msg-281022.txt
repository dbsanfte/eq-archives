Went to LFay earlier and noticed skeletons no longer agro. 
For fun I attacked one and it starts to rampage. I'm doing 
no damage at all to it and it hit me for 601, then 602 
before I backed off. It didn't follow, just stood there. 
This from a level 4 - 11 mob.

Later, I saw about 20 or 30 mobs stacked vertically. 
Mummies, Drakes, Fairies, Skeletons etc., all in one spot.

All of the NPC's in the zone were giants, as well as some of 
the mobs.

Something is way wrong with that zone!!
