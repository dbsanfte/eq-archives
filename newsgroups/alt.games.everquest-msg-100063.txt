I agree.  Which is why the line in my eqclient.ini file reads
SHOWINSPECTMESSAGES=FALSE.  If I'm not notified of another's
rudeness, I won't get upset.  I mind my own business, I expect
others to do the same.  There's no "punch-in-the-nose factor" in
EQ, (unlike real life), which means that many players feel they
can get away with any sort of behavior.  You've no doubt seen
that reflected in some of the responses to your post.

In game, I also have /inspect off so I don't inadvertently inspect
someone while banking, or whatever.  When I see someone with some
equipment that sparks my interest, I ask them about it.  It's never
an error to be polite.  In most cases the player involved will be
only too eager to tell me about his gear; how he acquired it, etc.

And yes, this question has flared up repeatedly for the past three
years, with no resolution.  Armor yourself as I outlined above and
ignore the rude people as best you can.
