I'm also sorry about the tone of that message.   RL shit has me on edge
enough that I probably shouldn't be posting to Usenet, as my tolerance is
somewhat lower than normal.

Understand though that I really don't care if  X idea is going into Y game
or whether the design team has changed thier mind making the entire
discussion academic.  As far as I'm concerned, until I get the actual game
in my house and installed on my computer, the entire discussion is already
academic.  Every project can be cancelled at the drop of a hat, so you might
as well enjoy the discussions for themselves while they last.

I really am interested in discussing whether X advertised feature is a good
idea or not.  Would it be a "good thing", and indeed, can it even be done
without massive problems?   If X is no longer going into the game, then it
only slightly changes the discussion to whether cancelling X was a good idea
or not.  ;)
