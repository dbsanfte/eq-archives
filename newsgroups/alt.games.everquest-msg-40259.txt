Connection cannot be judged, since it isn't in final release. Odds are that
Mythic will do what every other MMORPG has done, and overwhelmingly
underestimate how much they will need, and until they upgrade, the lag will
be terrible.

The interface is nice, many improvements over EQ that I would love EQ to
adopt.

Setting is fine.

Rule...ah, there we go. I dislike most of the founding principles of the
game. And not the PvP principle. I don't like how combat is handled. I
don't like how blandly similar most classes are. I don't like how travel is
handled (or rather, not handled). I find their rabid anti-twink measures to
be so severe, that they hurt you even if you are not a twink. Player
statistics (str/dex/int/wis/etc) mean even less in DAoC than in EQ.
Tradeskills are based on the everquest model of "let's give the players an
enourmous money sink where they pour hours and hours and hours into this
and get nothing in return". It goes on.

You didn't ask but I also have the problem that:
1) The game has no "crack", and is mind-numbingly boring. The only hook to
keep you playing is the PvP, but you won't get to that for several months,
and I frankly don't have the patience to slog through so much REALLY REALLY
BORING PvE to get to the "good part"...which likely will end up being not
so good.

2) The devs are FUCKING CLUELESS. There is a totally inadequate number of
mobs to kill at ANY level. It is ok now during the beta, but pile another
50,000 people into the game, and there is nothing to hunt. And that is
after the devs went through and boosted the spawn rates. From levels 1-20
(in midgard at least), the game world is way, WAY too small and
underpopulated to support a release playerbase.
2-a) The game is supposed to be out in 2 months, but easily requires
another 6 of testing
2-b) Most of the game won't be done in 2 months. Huge gaping holes exist in
too many portions of the game now that cannot possibly be filled in the
remaining time, unless mythic has been enourmously holding out on their
release of stuff and plan to do a MASSIVE content release in just the final
version. Which means that massive amount of content will receive little to
no testing, and will be horribly buggy.
2-c) Development priorities are totally fucked. The dual-wield bug went on
and on and on and on for 6+ months, with people begging for it to be
fixed...new patches would include a variety of hairstyles for characters.
2-d) What is possibly the most important testing aspect...real PvP in the
game, is COMPLETELY UNTESTED. Nobody knows *anything* about how it will
work. Existing PvP formats allow for this-class-vs-that-class
melee/spell/archery tests, but show nothing about Realm V Realm and how it
is envisioned to work in final release. Even if the game elements to test
it were in place (they aren't, not even close), the playerbase is totally
inadequate (in numbers) for the job.

The game is going to suck, and suck hard.
