Didn't someone post that you can only see the top 100 people? Is that 
correct?

Then unless you are 'it'... nobody can see your win/losses anyways. And 
sooner or later the top 100 are going to 99.5% or better so not being on 
it at all will be utterly meaningless. And being on it will only be 
slightly less meaningless.
