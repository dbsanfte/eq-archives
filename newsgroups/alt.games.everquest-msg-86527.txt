A friend and I both quit Eq in favor of DAoC right when DAoC
came out- big mistake.  The world is very small, the landscape
boring, the MOBs VERY boring (many mobs are just the same model
used over and over, just getting a little bigger).  Unitemized
dungeons REALLY suck and in game bugs were an annoyance.

There are a few advantages over EQ- better customer service, better
response to bugs, better looking player models, better interface,
and smooth play.  Some will consider anti-twink code (weapon/armor
degradation) a "good thing" (tm) but personally I thought it was
a pain in the ass and made everyone generic clones of each other.
Oh... and no zoning except in dungeons.

The thing that I absolultely could not deal with were the
unimaginitive landscape.  After being constantly awed by the
vastness of Eq and the extremely varied landscape playing DAoC
was a big let down.  Don't get me wrong I tried very hard to like
this game- I played it for 4 mos exclusively.  In the end I came
back to Eq because.... its just more fun.
