Note "not necessarily"  :)

Actually, my experiences have basically consisted of making the trip
several times safely during the day combined with making it once
successfully at night and getting ganked the next two nighttime
attempts. Therefore, as far as I'm concerned, the Kith is *no* place
to be at night.

As I said, I don't know the circumstances surrounding those particular
mobs taking notice of me. Maybe they aggro'd. someone else before me
for all I know, bringing them closer to the wall. Regardless, for me,
two to one odds on dying is *not* what I would call almost always
safe. :) Ymmv.
