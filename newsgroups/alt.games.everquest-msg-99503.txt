My original statement, since obviously, I need to piece it out to you for
better reading comprehension...  It states, "If I didn't know better,"
This, by most intentions, means that the person stating this believes
otherwise.  Which means the so called "childish accusation", you so
quaintly put it, was, in fact, not an accusation at all.  Furthermore,
under the context of the message, the rationalization of the post being
responded to, it is possible to get the impression, as it is possible for a
person in usenet to post under a different name, different location and
rationalize the validity of something that is false.  WHY ELSE DO YOU THINK
GMs AND GUIDES KEEP TELLING YOU THAT THEY CAN'T ACCEPT LOGS AND SCREENSHOTS
AS PROOF NOR SOMEONE ELSE AS A WITNESS.  Yes I did that in all caps for a
reason, to make a point.  Usenet is about as secure as an unsecure wallet
in a subway station in New York during rush hour.

Hard to apologize for a 'slur' that wasn't made, then be insulted with a
'slur' x 3 back over something you misunderstood to begin with.  So, why
bother?
