Well see, if the paladin had slay undead 3! Then my point would hold true!

I know clerics dps isnt all that fierce, but my wife certainly loves the
undead shit when we duo Ldons.
Oh and she can kill her undead add before I've killed my mob sometimes too
=)  Thats chain casting 2 undead nukes (i assume both are undead anyway..
this was before she got the new OoW nuke).. versus me 700 aa's, wielding the
best 2 1hand weapons currently available in the game!

Roar at their undead dps! =)

Hmm I thought that too, but a guildie paladin I recently talked with said
cleave doesn't effect Slays. Its not a critical hit per say, but more of a
special attack.. and (i think) ferocity is what he said boosts it.  Can't
remember if it was ferocity or something else.. but yes I drool when he
chain slays for 3,4,5k a pop!

Compared to 5 rogues, maybe not.  Im sure paladins necros clerics could more
than hold their own in specific maps/zones though!
