    Oh, no argument here as to whether it's pure sleeze or not. The guy who
did this is a slimeball. But saying that he'd advertised it as an ornate
mold isn't correct, and it's an important distinction to a GM if you want
recompensation.

    Oh, one more thing. A GM can help you with a stolen camp as long as you
can show the other party isn't sharing the spawn. ;-)
