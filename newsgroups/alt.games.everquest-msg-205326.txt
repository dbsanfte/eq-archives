I have a level 35 mag that I exclusively solo.  The last 10 levels or so I have
used the Earth pet exclusively, even tho stat wise the Water pet has better
attack value and recovers hit points faster, I use the Earth pet because it
roots.  I have used it because of pathing and aggro issues.  From level 25-28
or so, I soloed Forest Giants at the giant fort in the Warslicks woods.  It is
relatively easy to sit across the bridge near the rear exit and pull singles,
however, if not rooted they may drift off and aggro another giants right before
they die.  

Additionally, I hunted Golra's in Timorous Deep from about 30-34.  If you have
never hunted on that island, you can only get onto the island from the water at
the far ends of the cigar shaped island, when using my Water pet, when the
Golra was about to die, it would walk off the edge of the island and into the
water, if I was not quick enough to "back off" my pet then I would have make my
pet follow me to the end of the island to get him back up.  It is also a real
pain to chase the Golra into the water and try to whack it to death, since it
is swimming away and usually deeper, often hard to see, and I would lose him
when I had to swim up to get air.

So, when soloing, if a "root" is needed, the Earth pet is the way to go.

John
