HA! You call THIS a stressy life?? *WE* had to get up, even if we
were already killed, we did not even have a dad and a mother, not
even genetically and lived in a cavity in the 33th tooth of
Venril Sathir. All we could drink or eat was what we were able
to steal from the magic of a summoning mage, when some silly lvl 60ies 
came killing Venril. Then we just died *again* when it was about the 
time for all of us go LD, and since we are all lvl 1 *all the time* and
always needed an hour to get back, we did not even find our
corpses! All of this 24 hours every hour a day, because of
some silly bug that made time pass quicker! That's what I call
stress, none of this rich, fulfilled life of yours! 

Yes - none of these young yuppies nowadays will believe this, it's
just sad...
