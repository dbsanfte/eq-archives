Well, well.. the first snipe...
Annie...
 I am sorry I seem to have offended you. Obviously you are someone who takes
things very seriously. I am not a creature who should be often taken
seriously.  :) I am a very lighthearted, sarcastic (but not normally in a
mean way) individual....

As I explained to Lokari, who very gently chided me for this same comment:
>>>(like with a FAQ in 'idiot-ese' that even a female can comprehend)?

>Hey now, none of that. Females are every bit as capable as males.


<snip>
>You will find I tend to downplay female skill and intelligence...
am I doing this in sarcasm? Only my hairdresser knows... *snicker*
I don't really mean to cast a bad light on the fairer sex.   One of my
favorite lines is... "my .01 female opinion"... reason for the ONE instead
of TWO cents-I tend to be so vociferous with my opinions, were I to value
them at .02 they would quickly overrun and undervalue male opinions, due to
sheer volume. LOL.

That about explains it.  :)

I am female, (DeAnna Kay) and I am far from an idiot, although I do play one
quite well when it is required of me.. lol.  :)

DeAnna Kay
(Lamb)<----very female and fluent in English, innuendo and sarcasm.
