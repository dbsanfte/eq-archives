Yeah, you're right.  You need one extra level.
So go there tomorrow.

Ummm, Icewell dorfs are pretty easy and decent exp at low 50's and
high 40's.  Western Wastes is also decent assuming you don't pull
Sontalak with just one group.  DN is fantastic for high 40's all the
way to 60's.  That's one of the better designed zones in the game.

Siren's after the recent "tuning" yet again, is perfectly doable at 45
to 55 range.

Guess it varies from person to person.
I often log on my warrior twinkie for a couple of hours and get decent
exp grind.
