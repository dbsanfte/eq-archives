9.   Glossary

9.1  Q: What abbreviations and jargon show up in the game?

There's a lot of terms and abbreviations you'll run into, too many to cover
them all here, but I'll try to describe the ones that get asked about most
often (since this is, after all, an FAQ).  Certainly if you see any jargon
used in the FAQ itself and the term isn't explained here, let me know!  The
terms here are grouped into categories rather than listed alphabetically.

Generic chat shorthand

Many of these terms are not specific to EverQuest, but show up in chat rooms,
IM, and other places where people type messages to each other.  The terms are
often used in lower-case but are shown here in upper-case for clarity.

AFK
	away from keyboard (EQ even has an /afk command)
BRB
	be right back ("afk for a soda, brb!")
BTW
	by the way
JK
	just kidding
NM
	never mind
NP
	no problem
THX, TNX, TY
	thanks, or thank you
YW
	you're welcome
WTF
	what the ...?
LOL
	laughing out loud
ROFL
	rolling on the floor laughing
LMAO
	laughing my ass off (also, ROFLMAO = ROFL + LMAO)
K
	short for OK (no, really!); also seen as "kk", this shorthand may
        have arisen because messages between players sometimes arrive with
        the last letter cut off, so "kk" may appear as "k" whereas "ok"
        could appear as "o"
GTG
	good to go, i.e. ready; sometimes confusing because the same
        shorthand in a chat room or IM often means "got to go"
ATM
	at the moment
OMW
	on my way
PST
	Please Send Tell, used when someone uses /ooc or /auction to ask for
        or offer something and wants responses via /tell rather than having
        the whole zone have to listen to the answers

Money and Economics

plat, pp
	platinum, the largest unit of EQ currency
WTB, WTS, WTT
	want to buy / sell / trade

Monsters and Combat

These terms come up in lots of different contexts.  Several terms (e.g.,
mob, PvP) are used by players in other MMORPGs as well.

PC
	player character
NPC
	non-player character, especially one you might imagine talking to
mob
	any monster or NPC (short for "mobile object")
PH, place holder
	a mob that, if killed, sometimes reappears as a rarer mob
con, also /con
	short for /consider (which by default is tied to the "C" key),
	refers to the "color rating" of the mob and how much it hates or
	likes you:  "What does that con to you?"  "Yellow and scowling."
faction
	most mobs belong to one faction, and your standing with that
	faction can affect how the mobs react when you /con them
KOS
	kill on sight, a /con of "scowling" or "threatening", such that
	the mob will attack you even if you don't attack it:  "I'm KOS to
	the guards at Cabilis"
green, blue, LB, DB, white, yellow, red
	the color portion of a /con, i.e. the mob's level relative to yours
camp
	as a verb, this can mean "to exit the game", but as a noun it refers
	to an area where a certain set of static mobs spawns, such that a
	group (or solo) can wait nearby and kill the same mobs over and over
	as they reappear (see discussion in Grouping 101 document); hence
	also a verb "to camp" a set of mobs, or to camp a rare mob by killing
	its "placeholder mobs" hoping the replacement will be the rare one
breaking a camp
	killing all the mobs in a camp but spacing out the kills over time,
	so eventually the mobs respawn one at a time for easy killing
camp check
	also "CC" (though less often since that also means crowd control),
	this means someone is asking which camps are claimed so they don't
	waste their time going somewhere that other people are hunting
pop
	a mob suddenly appearing as the game world creates it; can be used
	to call attention to an anticipated respawning (often then called a
	"repop"), or to warn of a mob appearing amidst the group
aggro (also agro)
	a mob becoming aggressive; this term is used in lots of ways: "aggro
	radius" is how close you can get before a mob notices you, "social
	aggro" is when a mob attacks because another similar mob nearby is
	attacking, "aggroing" a mob means to make it mad at you, etc.
train
	lots of mobs chasing a player (who is usually running for the zone
	line); it's considered good form to shout a warning (or even to stop
	and let yourself be killed) if you think your train might run over
	other players
zone!
	used as an exclamation, this is a warning that you should run across
	the boundary to the adjacent zone to avoid being killed (e.g., if
	your group is fighting near a zone line and too many mobs appear)
wipe
	when your entire group dies, or a significant fraction of a raid
KS
	kill-steal, killing a mob after someone else has aggroed it and
        they haven't asked for help, such that you get the experience and
        loot; doing this deliberately can cost you your EQ account
PvP
	player-vs-player (see question 2.8.3)
hp
	hit points
xp
	experience points: "these DBs give good xp"

Spells in General

buff
	a long-lasting beneficial spell, or the action of casting one
        (see the list of shorthands for oft-requested spells, below)
MGB
	Mass Group Buff, a way of casting a buff on all players within a
	certain radius of the caster, often done by good samaritans in PoK
DD
	direct damage, something that applies damage once and is done
DOT
	damage over time, doing partial damage every 6 seconds
tick
	6 seconds (1/10 of a minute), the unit of time for recurring effects
	such as DOTs and mana regeneration (i.e., mana regen +3 gives you an
	extra 3 mana recovery per tick, or 30 per minute)
DS
	damage shield, a buff that does damage to anything that hits you
nuke
	a big DD spell
AE, AOE
	area effect (centered on a target, usually affecting at most 4)
PBAE
	point blank area effect (all mobs near the caster)
HOT
	heal over time
mez
	mesmerize, the enchanter's specialty, and really annoying when a
	mob does it to you
mem
	memorize one or more spells
FOM, LOM, OOM
	full of mana, low on mana, out of mana
med / medding
	meditating, when a caster sits to regain mana faster
wmp
	when mana permits (a fighter who says "Need DS wmp" is being patient
	and polite, and is not calling the caster a wimp!)

Miscellany

[Ed:  If anyone can suggest ways to organise some of these into new
or existing categories, please do!]

bubble
	one-fifth of a mana bar, hp bar, or experience bar
ding
	gained a level, as in "I just dinged 13!" (the proper response,
	no matter how trivial the level, is "Congratulations!" or something
	of the sort); this usually means a character level, but sometimes
	is used to refer to other skills:  "Ding! Tailoring 250!"  "Grats!"
ping
	sometimes used to refer to gaining an Alternate Ability point
trumpet
	used by some players to refer to any event where the game plays
	the trumpet fanfare (pinging an AA, completing a quest, etc.)
lag
	lowered responsiveness of the game, caused by a combination of
	network speed, machine power, and how much stuff the game is trying
	to draw:  "Turn off all spell effects on a raid, it'll reduce lag"
LD
	linkdead, lost the connection to the game server; this is what the
	game tells everyone else in your group when you're looking at a
	"You have been disconnected" screen
CR
	corpse run (or corpse recovery), the act of finding your corpse
	so you can loot it (and possibly resurrect it to regain some xp)
nerf
	what SOE is said to do when they take a useful (though perhaps
	overpowered) feature of the game and make it useless:  "They nerfed
	that shark that was dropping a million plat"
twink
	a character with equipment far above what is accessible to its
	level; it either got a lot of plat and bought gear in the Bazaar
	(a "bazaar twink") or a higher-level character, usually belonging
	to the same player, has supplied hand-me-downs ("twinked" it)
main
	the highest level character a player has, or the one he plays
	most often (frequently these are the same thing, of course)
alt
	other characters of the same player (i.e., other than the "main")
toon
	character (short for "cartoon"); some people dislike the term
griefer
	a player who deliberately causes trouble for other players, e.g. by
	leading trains of mobs to attack them, or tricking them into giving
	away hard-to-replace items, etc.; most forms of griefing can get the
	griefer's account banned, but only if a GM catches them in the act
FFA
	free-for-all, usually referring to looting corpses, i.e., agreeing that
	anyone in the group can loot anything they want (often used if the
	group is mainly seeking XP or killing "trash mobs" en route to a
	larger target)
ninja looting
	a form of griefing in which a player slips in without permission
	and loots a corpse killed by another group (once the timer has ticked
	down enough that the game allows it); some players also consider it
	ninja looting if one player is deliberately hogging all the loot in
	a FFA looting arrangement
loc?
	"what's your location?" (type /loc and report the numbers)
mistell
	Sending a message to the wrong person, e.g. by mixing up /gu and /g
	or misdirecting a /tell; telling someone "mistell" says your
	previous message wasn't intended for them; also seen as "MT" (which
	can also be Main Tank but context usually makes the meaning clear)
DPS
	damage per second, i.e. how fast is a mob being smacked down
LDON
	the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion, often used to refer to
	going on an "adventure" into one of the dungeons in that expansion
DON
	the Dragons of Norrath expansion, often used to refer to a mission
	in that expansion (e.g., "Looking for a tank for a DON")
MM
	a Monster Mission from the Depths of Darkhollow expansion
PoK
	Place of Knowledge, a popular gathering spot because it is easy
	to reach from so many places; many other zones also have common
	abbreviations, but they're too plentiful to list here
lull / pacify
	a spell or skill that prevents one or more mobs from aggroing on you
	while you drag off one of their friends
FD, feign
	feign death, a skill/spell used by monks/necromancers/shadowknights
GM
	either an NPC guildmaster, or a character run by a SOE representative
inc / incoming
	the puller's report of what's being brought; a puller should have a
	hotkey for "/g incoming %T", or something more colorful but to the
	same point:  "/g %T followed me home, can I keep %o?"
RL, IRL
	real life, in real life
kite
	to get a mob to run after you, either for crowd control (keeping
	it busy while the group kills something else) or so something or
	someone else can kill it while it chases you; sometimes refers to
	getting the mob to flee from you (fear-kiting)
farming
	repetitively collecting some form of resource at little or no risk;
	it could be as low level as a player farming spiderlings for silk, or
	as high level as a guild farming the Elemental Planes for gear
epic
	the reward at the end of a particularly long quest; each class has
	available a different set of epic quests unique to that class
No Trade
	an object that cannot be dropped, traded or sold; if you place
	a No Trade item inside a container, the container becomes No Trade
	until the item is removed (a frequent source of confusion)
Temporary
	an item that will go away 30 minutes after the bearer logs out
	(if it's a container, it used to be that everything inside also went
	away, but early in 2005 this was changed so the container instead
	becomes a very heavy non-magical bag, so you don't lose the contents)
No Drop, No Rent
	same as No Trade and Temporary; the latter terms were introduced in
	April 2005, but many old web sites, forums, and players still use
	the older terms, as do most in-game messages (e.g. if you try to put
	such an item into your shared bank, or try to loot a No Trade item
	with /lootnodrop [sic] set to "always confirm")
Lore
	an item that no character can have more than one of (but if it's
	droppable -- i.e., not No Trade -- there can be one in your shared
	bank as well)
Attuneable
	an item that will become No Trade the first time any
	character puts it on (you're asked to confirm doing so); attuneable
	augments, however, become No Trade when inserted into an item,
	even if you don't equip the item; you're asked to confirm inserting
	it but that confirmation doesn't warn you about the augment becoming
	attuned, so be careful!
PL
	power level, usually by having a high level character provide
	buffs, healing and other aid to accelerate a low level's progress
runner
	a mob that's trying to run away from you, especially if there's
	a risk it'll attract attention from other mobs
warp
	sudden change of location, particularly referring to a mob that
	gets stuck trying to chase you and suddenly appears in your face
LFG
	looking for a group
LFA
	looking for an LDON adventure
LFE
	looking for an OOW expedition
LFM
	looking for a DON mission
rampage
	a special extra attack some high level mobs get that attacks someone
	other than their current target (sometimes an AE vs multiple targets)
flurry
	two extra attacks on a mob's current target, an ability of some mobs
enraged
	a mob that is enraged automatically ripostes ALL melee attacks
	except those coming from behind it

Commonly requested spells

In crowded places (especially PoK) you'll often hear people asking for and/or
offering buffs and other spells.  Here are some of the most common ones:

KEI
	Koadic's Endless Intellect: adds INT, WIS, and mana regen, but
        the target has to be level 45 or higher
Clarity
	adds mana regen, not as much as KEI but it can be cast on
        characters of any level (and can be learned at lower levels, too)
C1, C2, etc.
	C1 is Clarity; C2 is Clarity II, which gives a bit more mana
        regen but only works on characters level 41 or higher; C3 is another
	name for KEI, and C4 etc. refer to still higher-level spells
SOW
	Spirit of the Wolf, increases your running speed
Temp
	Temperance, adds a lot of HP and AC
V
	Virtue, adds even more HP/AC, but works only on levels 46 and up
HOV
	Hand of Virtue, group version of Virtue for levels 47 and up
Kitty Crack
	Spiritual Light, a beastlord spell that gives HP and mana regen
	to an entire group
Port
	Transport: druids and wizards can transport other characters to many
        locations, so you may see someone asking for a "port to Iceclad" or
	other similar requests (often using abbreviated destination names)
rez
	resurrection, a spell that restores you to wherever your corpse
	is and (at higher levels of the spell) returns some fraction of the
	experience lost when you died

Here are some other spells that come up often in discussions, especially of
raid tactics:

CH
	Complete Heal (which heals 7500 hp but takes 10 seconds to cast)
COTH
	Call of the Hero: a magician spell that transports a groupmate to
	the mage from anywhere else in the same zone

Roles in a group

These terms are described in more detail in the discussion on grouping, at
http://www.icynic.com/~don/EQ/grouping101.htm.

Puller
	The person who goes out and gets mobs (hopefully in manageable
	numbers) to follow him back to the group to be killed
MA
	Main Assist, the person that tells everyone else what to kill
MT
	Main Tank, the person whom you try and get a mob to hit
	(sometimes also used as shorthand for "mistell")
ST
	Secondary Tank, backup for MT if stuff happens
SA
	Secondary Assist, backup for MA if MA goes down or MA misses something
CC
	Crowd Control, keeping extra mobs busy (rooted, mezzed, chasing
	someone around, whatever) while the group focuses on the MA's target
OT
	Off Tank, person who is tanking a mob that the main force is not
	trying to kill at the moment; off-tanking is a form of crowd control
ML

	later division (see question 3.24)

About maps:  If you have the Legacy of Ykesha expansion it is a real good
idea to get all the maps from eq-toolbox and load them in your EverQuest
maps folder.  EverQuest is a HUGE game with over 200 zones; in game maps
help you to get around.  Here are a couple map tips:
* If you pull up the maps and can't see anything then zoom the map out by
  clicking on the "-" button near the upper right corner of the map.  You
  may have to click this button many times.  Alternately, if you have a mouse
  with a scroll wheel, you can hover your mouse pointer over the map and zoom
  the map in and out with the scroll wheel.  Also, turn off the height
  filter to make sure you're seeing all the lines on the map.
* If the map is hard to see because the lines are too light, right-click
  on the title bar of the map and change the "Alpha" (normal and faded)
  levels to lighten the background of the map.  This allows you to see the
  map and the screen behind it so it doesn't block your view.  This is why
  so many maps are drawn with grey lines.

For player equipment prices:
  http://www.eqprices.com/ has a list of prices for various items, but the
  information it gives is suspect for a few reasons.  For one, the going
  price on any particular item can vary a great deal from server to server.
  Also, prices often rise or fall over time given to inflation, deflation,
  and newer, better items becoming more common.  Another problem with this
  site is that the prices are given by the player base, many of whom may be
  reporting the asking prices for items they were selling, instead of the
  prices that people were actually willing to pay.

Server Community Forums

There are offical community Forums at:
  http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq?category.id=servers

Many servers also have unofficial forums, though in many cases they can be
more active than the offical ones.  Here are links to several.  Note
that the Zek forums are still named for the individual server communities
that got merged to form the current Zek.  Likewise, many of these links are
for servers scheduled to be merged during April/May 2005, but the forums for
the individual original servers are likely to remain active for some time.

April Fools link:
  Last year's April edition of the FAQ had an item about SOE being acquired
    by plat-vendor Yantis.  Nobody remarked on that, so this time I tried
    claiming Sony has bought out Blizzard.  Hey, one of these years one of
    these spoof items will turn out to be for real, which'll fool you all!
