Casters Realm is helping to propogate the rumor that hell levels may
be going away, which at first I was very excited about.  However, the
more I think about it, the more I wonder if it really will be good for
the game.  Sure, getting through 45 was one of the more frustrating
things I've been through, but it does well to keep everyone from
hitting 60 too quickly.  I'm currently dreading hitting 50 and every
level thereafter, but I also look forward to the sense of
accomplishment I'll have when I do hit the next one.

So, I throw it out to you...getting rid of hells...good or bad?

As an aside, day 1 of gnome SK's I may have to create a new main.
