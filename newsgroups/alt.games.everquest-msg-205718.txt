Fear kite.  I use my rogue pet there with pet taunting turned off.  You can
pull them to the south of the entrance, and Invoke Fear will break before
they run into the scouts that are standing around outside their fort.  I use
Dooming Darkness, Splurt, and Bond of Death.  Sit on top of the big rock and
wait for fear to break.  When it does, call off the pet, because they will
hit him hard and fast.  When the gatherer gets back near you, fear him again
and send pet again.  By this time, he should be around 30% or so hp.  When
Dooming breaks, I usually cast Engulfing but it's really not even necessary,
as he should be headed south if you did it right, and there's nothing in
that little area to aggro.  If you get a lookout, and I think also a
follower, they have more hp so will need to have another Dooming and maybe a
third fear.  This is good for about 1 percent of an AA per kill... not
great, but it's outdoor fear kiting just like I did throughout my career.
