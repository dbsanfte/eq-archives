An Iksar Warrior or SK? Cool. Most Iksar I see are Monks, but a few are Necros.

Well, I'd normally suggest just spending 5 points max on Smithing, then making
Metal Bits (2 small pieces of metal and a flask of water), but if you don't
want to spend the plat to do that.....

I would advise keeping just about every rusty weapon you loot off of monsters
(Orc Pawns and Decaying Skeletons, especially) and sharpening them. I think the
rusty scythe and the 2-handed warhammer  are the only two weapons you can't
sharpen.

(Maybe on the 2-handed warhammer; I know for sure you can't sharpen the scythe)

Keep Rusty 2-handed swords in the bank and save them for later; they have the
highest trivial.

Have you checked out the info on Smithing at eqtraders?
