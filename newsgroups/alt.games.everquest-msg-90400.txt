Just be a little careful on what guild you choose.
The "i pay 10pp to each person joining my guild" types are something i 
would avoid, so are the "New guild forming, the first 10 people get to 
be officers". Paying people to join guilds are just ridiculous, and 
having the first 10 people be officers kinda assures that the quality of 
the officers arent exactly based on their playing of helpfullness.

Generally i would avoid new forming guilds too. Im sure they can be good 
in some cases, but generally a new guild just mean low level or number 
of members, that theyre 8 friends that just needed 3 more to start it, 
and other problems like that.
