Hello,

I've been grouping for the last 12 levels straight, and my combat
skills have suffered. They weren't all that hot to begin with, but now
they are so low I can't even hit the mobs we're fighting often enough
to skill up between medding and casting. So I need to find some nice
soft hitting very light blues to skill up on. I'm level 31 now and was
hoping someone had some suggestions. Preferably something that doesnï¿½t
hit too hard, and isn't too social. I've been soloing the mammoths in
Ever Frost occasionally over the last few levels, but they hit really
hard. :)
