Dunno about Lightning Call in particular, but many of the spells in the
spdat are class special abilities (i.e. Lay Hands for Paladin), item
effects, and AA abilities.  Others are (apparently) placeholders and/or
not yet accessible in-game (i.e. no spell scroll items exist for them).
I certainly never had any luck locating Lightning Call for my druid,
had to settle for plain old Call Lightning.
