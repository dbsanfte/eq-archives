When I went to xp a while back I found that there were issues with
Athlon+nvidia+xp+camelot.  Reading the message boards I could see that
people with Intel did not have similar problems.  I was very surprised there
could be compatibility issues at this late date, but there you have it.  I
will be very hesitant to buy another Athlon.  You can try to blame it on xp
but
Athlon+nvidia+xp+camelot= problem
Intel+nvidia+xp+camelot= no problem
