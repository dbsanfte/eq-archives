"assume... the SK doesn't cast any spells"

Why the hell wouldn't you make a warrior?  I'm still laughing at "assume the
SK doesn't cast any spells".

Here's the answer to all your questions:

Monk will kill faster, SK will live longer *in battle*, monk is harder to
kill, and who will be a better partner for a shaman requires more info from
you.  Do you plan on both being level 65 within a couple months?  If not,
then monk/shaman is just fine.  Above level 60, though, and even below level
60 unless you are good at equipping, monk/shaman is no longer a viable
option.  Or, to put it another way, at 65 the shaman could do just as well
solo as he could with a monk partner, if not better.

And if you never plan on casting any spells with the SK, do yourself a favor
and make a warrior...
