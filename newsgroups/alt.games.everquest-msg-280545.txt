Nah, the money making guide was funnier.   Apparently the secrets of making
big money in WoW are...

1) Beg high level players.
2) Get in a group with a level 60 character, and go to a level 40 dungeon with
him allowing you to loot all of the corpses.

Now there's advice worth paying $10 for any day!

"We need a new Mario game, where you rescue the princess in the first ten
minutes, and for the rest of the game you try and push down that sick feeling
in your stomach that she's "damaged goods"... When Peach asks you, in the
quiet of her mushroom castle bedroom "do you still love me?" you pretend to be
asleep. You press the A button rhythmically, to control your breath, keep it
even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
