Hehe, wish a newbie on my server would say that.
Me and a RL friend had our trolls (level 10 trolls, twinked) camping the Wall
Derv camp in NRo for 3 days, shouting out that we DIDNT want the loot, could
not carry it, and didnt feel like leaving from our camp running all the wy back
to Grobb to get maybe 2pp from all the copper and silver.
3 times the only response to our "free loot" shout was people telling out that
they could easily get the derv rings themselves.
So ALL loot (derv rings, bronze weapons, LOTS of cp and sp) from 3 days of
camping just lay on the ground and rot, since nobody wanted free loot.
