Certainly not just your server. We all have our share. We're on Xev, and this
weekend there was some idiot iksar monk pestering my cleric partner for a rez even
though we were in the middle of pretty steady fighting/medding.  She finally
agreed just to shut him up, but also because he offered a hundred plat or some
rediculous sum.  Unlike ports and such, you can't generally get paid for a rez
until you perform the services as the person's funds are still on the body. Well,
she ditches out of our camp and goes to rez the guy. And of course, no payment
afterwards and the monk runs off without a word. I don't have the *exact* spelling
of his name, so I won't post it here to avoid possibly dissing somebody else with
a similar name, but you can rest assured a guy like this, if he keeps it up, is
going to find it very hard to get rezzed later on in life when he *really* needs
it. (He's only in his early 30's now.)
