All the client knows is that the login server is unavailable.

There is no way for the client to know if the server is unavailable because
it is actually down versus network congestion.

If the server is unavailable, whether it is down or because of network
congestion, there is no way to get a short text message out.  If it could,
then the server wouldn't be unavailable.
