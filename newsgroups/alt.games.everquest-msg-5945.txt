who's Emit? not me...

and if thats an attempt to learn my real name, don't worry about it, I'm
untouchable to you.

I'm self-employed so there is no one for you to call and complain about
me.

you don't want to listen I realise why, this is fun for you on some
level and you don't want to stop... but ask yourself...

why is it fun?

what need is all this fullfilling in your life?
