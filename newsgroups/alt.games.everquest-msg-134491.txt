From the EQ website:

Guidelines and Restrictions:

For moving Characters from one account to a different account on the same
server, Characters will be moved with items and coins. In order to process a
transfer from one account to a different account, the destination account
must have access to the same expansions as the source account.



For moving Characters from one server to a different server, Characters will
only be moved without ITEMS AND COINS. (IMPORTANT: Coins and all items will
be deleted from characters before the characters are moved. This includes
all items located in the character's bank. All scribed spells will transfer
with the character). It is highly recommended that you do not give away or
destroy existing items upon requesting a server-to-server transfer, as it is
possible that your move request may be denied. Items deleted or given away
in anticipation of a future move will not be replaced.



So, yes you can move that character as long as you re-activate your old
account. The good thing is you get to keep all your stuff as well.
