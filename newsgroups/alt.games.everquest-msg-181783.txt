You don't need wisdom that high.  Just go to the nexus and get a kei.  They
give them out for donation and no one has ever complained about getting 20p
from my low level character.  Some even advertise 'donation appreciated but
not necessary'.  Some may say you don't even need kei, but it don't hurt
either.  On my server there is someone there 24/7 giving kei.  Go get some
before they nerf it.
