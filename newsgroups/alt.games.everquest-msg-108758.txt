Yup. While there can occasionally be problems, in general it's a
pretty safe run.

Back when the nightly undead were added and all the morons started
whining about how it was a death trap, I did an experiment. I made two
first level characters (a human and a halfling) and ran them both
through there, with no buffs or any gear aside from their starting
junk.

I ran the human across the same run twice, no problems. Of course,
*getting* a level one human to Kithicor at night, that was a bit of
trouble. But the run through was uneventful. 

To prove that the human wasn't just "luck" as some people said, I ran
the halfling back and forth across the top wall from WC to Highpass,
at night, for ten round trips. No problems at all.

Kithicor at night, for a player who has half a brain, is no more an
automatic death trap than the Dragon Portal in Iceclad is.
