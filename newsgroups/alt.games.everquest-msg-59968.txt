Try warder numba 1.

Seriously, Malalafen is a gimp.  Naggy AoE + Fear and occasional
Flurry.  It's almost identical to the first warder (the fire AoE +
dispell one), maybe a tiny bit more difficult since he will proc
Flurry once is a while.

Tell them they can get CoFs for their twinkies.  Yep, he loads Naggy
loot (Naggy loot + essensce loot on a 45 min timer...gee, I wonder why
our GM perma-killed this...).  Now I just gotta find some idio..err,
player who wants to by a couple of heirocrooks, blights and some
stupid shield with Rune charges on it...forgot the name.

Max 500 fire nuke + dispell and Fear that can be resisted with any MR
over 150.

Let's just say if you want the other stuff, have someone who wants
that other stuff "die" before taking the faction hit.  :)
