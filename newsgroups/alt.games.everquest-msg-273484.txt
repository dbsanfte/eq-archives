Total rumors.  The fact that the only servers that have even been hinted at
"officially" are the PvP servers, which could have been done years ago with
no ill effect, and no date is set, suggests that any server merges for the
regular servers, if they happen at all, are still a long ways off.

The way the game is designed, they have no economic incentive to merge
servers, as they can run multiple zones on the same physical computer, and
consolidate in the "back end" for any cost cutting reasons.

I'd search out server forums for various servers, look for the recruiting
posts, and do a little shopping.  You don't mention where you are personally
in progression, which would have some impact on what you might be looking
for.  You definitely want to be sure of your decision if it involves
switching servers.
