I do plenty of that too.  I also often am able to get just where I want to,
thanks to this.

When I am old enough I'll kill him once on your behalf.

He was bummed, I'm sure, but he doesn't get too worked up over such
things.  I try not to also; we play the game for fun, after all.  Once in a
while if one of my boys gets upset over something in the game, I decide
it's time for him to do something else.

Just a couple days ago my older boy was with me when some particularly
frustrating thing was making the game difficult for me, and I did get
somewhat worked up over it.  I realized I was setting a bad example, and
reminded myself that it's just a game.

This is off-topic for this thread, but let me say that if anyone reading this
plays on Bertox and has grouped with a warrior named Kuddace, thank you.
That is my older boy's main, and he's had consistently terrific experiences
with all of you.  Though problem players often get more attention, or at
least generate more discussion, I believe that for each of those, there are
many wonderful players who are fun to play with.  Thanks again.

All right, I'm off to get that darn Gundl now.        >:-)
