There's no change to how they behave, it's just the way they were being
stored in the spell data that was changed and Lucy doesn't parse the
new format correctly yet.

Basically it's now a multiplier instead of an increase/decrease.  I.e.,
instead of saying 'increase aggro by 10%' it now says 'new aggro is 110%
of original aggro' which is exactly the same thing.
