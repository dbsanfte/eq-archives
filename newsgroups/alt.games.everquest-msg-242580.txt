You knew you'd be flamed.. so at least part of you knows that your response
to the OP was an over reaction..
and for someone who only plays to have fun, you sure spent alot of time
"defending" your position, doesnt sound like it was alot of fun to me,
personally.




Sorry if my "flame" (as I am sure you will decide to call any statement that
disagrees with you) was not up to expectations, but I only have a bic
lighter and not the giant firegun of death(tm) bizbee carries around.
