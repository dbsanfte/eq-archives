Today while running to kaladim with my Dwarven cleric from Gfay I zoned and
ran into a site i will most likely never see again in my life.  At the
Butcherblock/Gfay zone there were 3 GM's.  They were standing around  asking
trivia questions about the history, people and places of Norrath.  They were
also handing out free beer!!!  Volrath's blessed stout if i remember right.
No prizes were handed out and no one died (unlike normal GM events).  I had
a bunch of fun and learn somethings i did not know before.
