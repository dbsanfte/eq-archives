Don't forget the new Plane of Hate and Plane of Mischief while you're
looking.   The new Droga is also nice.

As for your lack of a porter, gate potions aren't too expensive these days.

There are a lot of good items in many of them.  A vast majority of those 75k
items you see in the bazaar that are upgrades but not worth the price
charged... these are the places they drop.   If players can't be bothered to
get out there and find them, it's not my fault.

*shrug*  Not according to what I see in this thread.    Apparently all level
65's are gods.

The "average player" has more content available to them today then I had
back then.   For the most part, they just don't want to use it. Hopefully
Sony doesn't have to have another LoY type flop to realize that.
