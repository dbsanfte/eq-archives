All true and yes I know it's not the same thing (was trying for funny..
didn't work huh?). However even at 41 most people are within one zone of a
book. True, not right in the zone, but not far enough away that it really
defeats the purpose. I know there are some that wouldn't leave just for
that (me being one ... as I said I've *NEVER* gone to PoK, or anywhere else
for that matter, just for that or any other buff) but there are those who
would do it just thinking it would boost their kill rate wouldn't you
agree? As a matter of fact, I've been in a group where some of the casters
left the group for a bit to get a "fix" and were quite upset when they were
replaced and not allowed to come back in. What it boils down to is there
are players that live by it and (whether it's "efficient" or not) will go
get it no matter what.
