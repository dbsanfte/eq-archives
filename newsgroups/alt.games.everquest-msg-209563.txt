Um, that particular RPer isn't bothering me now, is he?  You seem to
be ignoring the places where I made it clear (I thought) that I was
objecting to folks who demand that I make special accomodation for
them, not to those who go off and do their own thing.

Hmm, "significant risk"?  where does that enter in here?  Aside from
the fact that I abandoned my old main and his twinks, I'm just not at
all seeing what you're on about there.

You somehow missed my point.  Completely.  Every one of those folks
out there having fun without messing with me is golden, in my view.
And that's true whether they're in the Elemental Planes gearing up
for PoTime or off mid-level RPing somewhere in the old world, or
doing most anything else so long as they aren't insisting that I
place greater importance on their fun than on mine.  I thought I had
made it clear that my objection was to the imposition of your fun on
my play.
