Single SOW potions are for putting in the bank for CRs.  For the most
part, people who need and can afford one already have one sitting there.

Stacked SOW potions are also not for immediate use, since only a shaman
can sell you a stack (well, that or a middleman, but thats rare) you expect
to get a cast SOW as a bonus for buying stacks.

Stacked SOW is for soloing or grouping outdoors without a SOW class.
Helping you to make buying stacked SOW isn't just being nice to you,
its actually helping you cut the throats of the SOW classes, including
yourself...

I'm not suggesting that selling SOW potions itself is wrong... just that there's

another side to things you aren't considering

Druids and wizzards that TP for free are also cutting the throats of those who
depend on their TP abilities to get into groups.  People that TP or SOW people
for CR are cutting the throats of clerics who could be ressing them.  This
might mean clerics don't get into groups, or it might mean that they don't make
scads of money.

You don't cherish your alchemy skill if the only thing you are making is SOW
potions, particularly if they are trivial for you to make.  You merely thought
that SOW potions were a quick and easy shortcut to riches.  Well the awful
truth is that no skill out there is that.  You need to work, and work hard, at
a skill in order to make a decent living off of it compared to adventuring, and
even if you  do you won't be getting exp while you work or spend ages
auctioning.

Also, as others have pointed out, you need to go where people are who
have money and need SOW potions.  People over level 50 almost all
have JBoots or TBoots, people under 35 can't really be drinking 10pp
every half hour or so on a regular basis.  So you are looking for high
30 low 40's zones, outdoors, with decent money, where people commonly
solo or fight in small groups.

Eastern Wastes, Great Divide, Rathe Mountains... to a lesser extent,
Frontier Mountains, Iceclad, and Dreadlands.  Another good approach
would be to go to the auction zones, EC, GFay, and Thurgadin, where
you see people outfitting themselves or their twinks.

I don't see Firiona Vie as fitting any of those constraints; low population,
mostly low level, hardly any auctioning taking place other than folks trying
to sell stuff they are about to shove in the bank or vendorize... more
sellers than buyers by a long shot.
