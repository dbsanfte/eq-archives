We get this whine every time. Do you have any idea what's involved in
patching servers like the ones VI runs EQ on? Multiply that by the number of
"worlds". No, multiply that by 3, because each world is really 3 servers.
Now, add in time to make sure everythings running okay before opening the
doors back up. This isn't anything close to as simple as just running an
update program that zips through in 5 minutes...

8 hours is the standard. Sometimes it goes a little less, sometimes more.
Get used to it...otherwise, you'd better find yourself another game.
