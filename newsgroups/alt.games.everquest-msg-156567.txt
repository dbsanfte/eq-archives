Oh yeah! Forgot to mention, if for some reason
you find yourself getting chased around and are about
to die. Try to die by a path or close to that way if you
hadn't got the /loc thing down pat, following a path till
you find it is a little bit easier then dying with lots of trees
or snow and such around you. I know it's easier said then
done.

You can also try this tactic: Always keep GATE and your ROOT
spell memorizied. That way if you find yourself in trouble it's
possible to ROOT the mob and run or ROOT then GATE that way
you can gate to your nearest bind point. This will be a little difficult
at first but soon enough you'll get it down, you'll see.

When you reach lvl 14 and get Bind Affinity bind yourself as soon as
you zone in. That way if for some reason you find yourself in the fetal
position (dead) or gated away from trouble you can zone and get
rid of aggro and zone back. At least until you get some of your gate
spells at lvl 19.
