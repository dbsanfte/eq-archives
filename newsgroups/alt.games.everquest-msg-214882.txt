Sorry, my daughter and wife require my correction all the time as ESOL

misspelling

It's alright. :-) I correct my husbands spelling all the time, this gave me
a dose of my own medicine. lol  On the up side of the whole blasted LDoN
trap thread, I got my lost level back and then some. Finally hit 31. Course,
it wasn't doing a dungeon but oh well. Sat around LFG for over an hour. Got
some people, then sat around for another hour looking for a healer. Couldn't
find anyone. :-/   Decided to abandon the dungeon idea for the night.
Ended up going to the Overthere and found a good group pretty quickly.
