Dunno about the poison questions, my rogue is only 23 himself.  I've heard
you can go to the Abysmal Sea and get all of the tradeskills to 52 for free,
just time consuming.  Can class-specific tradeskills be done here as well,,
i.e. Poison, Alchemy, Tinkering?

But as far as weapons go, I can sorta answer that.  Always keep a piercer in
your main hand for backstabs.  Secondary weapon, pure personal preference.
You can go dual piercers your entire life just fine.  But when that 1HB or
1HS weap drops, you won't hit jack with it with a skill starting of 0.  So
it wouldn't hurt to use a 1HS and/or 1HB as your secondary weapon just to
get those skills up.  I myself never use dual piercers, instead 1HB and 1HS
to try to keep that maxed each level.  Their skills raise slower, being in
the second hand and all.
