Don't forget hp buffs too.

Stamina and direct hp buffs like Kragg/Tuna are just as important once
your cleric is CHealing. You'll no doubt be asked for str, agi, dex,
which have a VERY small effect on efficiency. If you're FM, by all means
cast them, but going OOM all the time trying to maintain those stat
buffs of the entire group is simply ineffective
