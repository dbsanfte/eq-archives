I think the answer is in that date of August 2004. It is not correct.
August is when the pre-order goodie will come out (the character creation
CD that will allow you to save out your customization config file), not
the game.  SOE has only said 2004 as the absolute, and to do some degree
they have said "Fall 2004".  Strictly speaking that is late september at
the earliest, mid-December at the latest.
