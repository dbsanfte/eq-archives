  Verant can ban you on a whim.  I'm not sure if they explicitly say
it's against their rules, but I do know that they reserve the right in
their TOS to discontinue service for anyone for anything they see fit.
This fact was evidenced by that whole thing a year or so ago where
that one player was banned for writing controversial fan fic based in
Norrath.
