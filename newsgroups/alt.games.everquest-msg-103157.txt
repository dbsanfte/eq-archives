Wait?  Why wouldn't they have the temperment to train ranger?  Would
seem to me that it would take the same temperment to train rangers
that it would to train a warrior, just tempered by some religious
zeal.  I mean, from an EQ Ranger perspective, which is basically the
same thing as a paladin.  EQ Rangers are just Holy Warriors for
Nature, or their respective representation there of.

If we're talking your more classical, Tolkien version of a ranger,
then I see your point.
