North Korea did not lose a war to the US....er I mean UN in '91. The
terms of the cease-fire (which Iraq has violated hundreds of times by
firing on US planes over the last 10+ years) prohibit SH from
acquiring WMD, yet he continues to build and stockpile them while
playing games with UN weapons inspectors. There is more than ample
reason to end the cease-fire and send in the troops to finish the job.
This isn't a new war with Iraq, it is the conclusion of the one
started in '90 when SH invaded Kuwait.

Oil has nothing to do with it. SH never stopped being a threat, the
sad truth is the previous US administration simply ignored the issue.
(with the exception of a few bombings or Tomahawk missle attacks
whenever "Blow-Job Bill" needed to direct attention away from his
latest scandal).

Further there is no reason to believe the NK won't be dealt with once
the situation in the ME is more stable.

If you think oil is a factor, then you need to do some more research
on the issue. Oil wasn't a factor in '91 and it isn't one now.
