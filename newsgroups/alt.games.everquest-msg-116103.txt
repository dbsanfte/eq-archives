About 2 patches ago, I started having the same problem, sound randomly goes
away.  Usually, when this happens, I just get no sound at all in game.  If I
exit, and restart, sound will magically start working, sometimes.
Sometimes, if I camp to the character select screen, the sound just plays a
short loop over and over, driving me nuts.  This does not go away when I
select a character and play, I end up having to either turn sound off, or
exit all the way and restart.
