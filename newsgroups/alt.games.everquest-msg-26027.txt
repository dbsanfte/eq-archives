Actually, I have just reached 20 too, a bit of a blurb on my character:

Half Elf Paladin known as Taliewin Lifesworde.

Explored pretty much all Faydwer, been to Tox Forest (It is really dark, and
I have infravision!), Everfrost, LoIO.  Learnt that make sure you bind in NK
before going onto Qeynos while still bound in FP.  Freeport is the place to
go if you like the city, Qeynos is just a country town (I prefer that BTW
unless I am buying from PCs).  Just as you have traffic jams in cities you
have bad lag in EQ cities, especially NFP.

Learnt that a comment about how good a high lvl characters looks etc. can
get great results! (No, I don't do it for that reason :-)! ).  That just as
in RL travelling can be expensive.  Five Paladins and a Druid in Unrest
almost re-enact the walls of Jericho again they rock the place that much
(OH, can't forget the couple of Ghoulbanes too!).  If you don't feel like
roleplaying then a Paladin and SK make an excellent combo (btw, I roleplay
but my character is the type who accepts every other one for who they are,
unless he feels they threaten the good).

Never explore Everfrost without a map, frost giants are nasty and it is easy
to get lost.  LoIO can be great for exp, but all the Power Leveling and
Training idiots are there too, and can really muck things up.  Crushbone
Orcs are no longer your worst nightmares.  Never dance around a brownie in
LFay with invis, it does wear off you know!

As for running, as a Paladin I feel it is my duty to stay until everyone
else has cleared out, and since I know how long I can last holding back the
mobs I usually tell the group to run when I know the clerics and enchanters
(although I have only been in one group so far that the other group members
were helping the enchanter's work) are OOM.  I find that at least at my
level very few clerics will say when to run, they seem to be the trusting
type (I may just have had an unusual experience).  So I see it as my duty to
watch everybody's health bars and monitor the chat screen for OOMs and yell
RUN myself - it may mean I am doing a lot of things at once but I believe it
helps the group overall - plus it seems that Paladins are really designed to
protect the casters anyway.

I have joined a guild, and while it has its shortcomings I find it quite
good.  It would have about 30 members, the high lvls are usually quite
willing to help the lower ones.  As I get higher in Lvl I would probably
join another one unless this one becomes I suppose what you would call a bit
more organised, although a couple of new officers have just been appointed
and things are getting better.  But I have made great friends through it and
find it invaluable for the info you can get without having to /ooc and hope
you get a response.  I would say that the two greatest things that form a
successful guild are trust and vision.  My guild has the trust, but not the
vision, I believe.  As others have said, find a guild that has a similar
goal or vision to you, and where everyone in it trusts one another, which
really means they treat you as an individual, not just a member.
