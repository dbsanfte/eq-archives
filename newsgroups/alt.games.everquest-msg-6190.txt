AAAAAAAAAARGGGHH!!!!
(Whew! I feel better now.)  Ok, I went from HH to Freeport last night. Mind you,
this was after turning in so many scalps and ears in HPH and HHK that my troll is
now regarded KINDLY there.  I got to W. Commons and decided to con one of the
guards there just to be safe.
(drum roll.........................................................)
I was "Glares at you Threateningly".  In other words, not quite as bad as
scowling, but still KOS. Would it not have looked so bad for a big mean troll
warrior, I would have sat down on the grass there in the fields of the commonlands
and cried. Then, as if to add insult to injury and to remind me of what everyone
in this part of the world thinks of trolls, a stupid kodiak attacked me.
Completely green, of course, and I ganked him in about six swings, but it still
just seemed an affront to my sensibilities.
  At that point, there was no way I was running all the way back to HHK and doing
it all over again just for some stupid faction thing, so I went and located the E.
Freeport tunnel entrance. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was only
dubious to the rougues in the tunnel, and to the dark elf on the rocks out by the
ocean. Shortly thereafter, the boat showed up, and I was able to run on to it
without the little fishing girl attacking me.
  Now I'm out in Ocean of Tears, camped on the shores of Sister Island, and have
to remind myself that I won't just be able to stroll off the boat upon my return.
   Sometimes, it just ain't easy being evil.
