Here's a simple fact for you:  The highest level non-named mob in
Skyfire besides the guardian wurms and ancient wyverns (which are both
level 60 and those hit a FUCKLOAD harder than level 60 mobs in
dungeons) is the elder wyverns which cons between level 48 to 52.
They hit for 170.  I know, I got hit by them while trying to get snare
to stick at level 52.

*THOSE* are considered level 50 mobs.
That is the same level range at Krup knights.  Krup knights hit for
130.  My level 60 druid can trivial tank a krup.  My level 60 druid
would be a grease stain against a skyfire drake.

See the distinction?

You might want to pull your head outta your ass and check again since
with the "upgrade" to Velk, Sebilis usually has around 20 to 30
people, unless some guild is bum-rushing Trakanon.

You know what?  Nevermind.  Stay in Skyfire, the longer it takes shit
players like you to level the better off the rest of the server would
be.
