Dangit - i hit post again before i wanted to. Let me add I know you
are not suggesting that enchanters are the same as warriors, my point
was that in most classless games, people tend to pick the same skill
sets, so while there is some variety, Ive found that many tend to be
copies of each other in their pursiut of the quickest way to the "end"
game. Most skills in these games boil down to either "extremely
useful" or "just kind of fun" where most focus on the "extremely
useful" ones. If theres enough diversity and variety - this could be
interesting. Certainly in EQ each level 60 enchanter is pretty much
the same, its how the different classes work together that I find
appealing. Also the classes define roles and expectations pretty well
whereas in skill based games, this lines are very blurred.
