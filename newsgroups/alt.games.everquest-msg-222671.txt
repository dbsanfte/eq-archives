Linear?

A little... not much moreso than 'keys' of expansions past though, 
except that getting flagged is usually easier than being keyed because 
to get keyed, each person needs to actually get one... while to get 
flagged you only need to 'be there' once.

As to game lore and spoiler sites,

I think the 'average player' learned on spoiler sites, and not in game. 
Although I do beleive the info is in game this time at at least.
