Hi,

I have another question.  Does putting a Plains Pebble in your inventory
have any real effect upon your rate of food and/or water consumption?

Or is this just a rumor?

If there is any truth to this, how does it work?  And does it apply
to all drinks and foods?

I have heard some people say you need to place the pebble into the
container holding your food/drink, while other's say it goes into
one of your inventory slots.

Still, other people say it has no effect whatsoever.

Thanks.

Best Regards,
