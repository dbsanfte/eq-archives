If you bought EQ (original release), it has the video, and you can install
it directly to your computer.  Last time I actually used my EQ disks were to
make a copy, and that isn't really even needed since the key is a use once
activation, and you can use anybody's CD to install with (since the key is
kept on their server, no need to even remember it).

The monitor is a Sony Trinitron (pretty sure, thats what they said, didn't
have any reason to lie, and I've not felt like pulling it back out to look
in back), but they said it is a 1995 year, and is the kind with the 5 cables
going into the back (the red/green/blue/black/white on one end, and normal
monitor cable on the other).
    "Non standard"?  It's a Sony (the person I got it from said that at
least, it's not on front, maybe either worn off or is on back...no need to
look, it's lasted this long in good condition to the point where I can't
tell any problems, so thats good enough).  Sony = Doesn't follow indrustry
standard because they're "special" and have to be different (recordable CDs
in digital cameras? Memory sticks? Few other things I can't think of at this
time of the morning? Decides to build DirecTV systems that produce allot of
heat & see what happens if you leave out most of the vent holes.  Some of
their remotes have to be different & have buttons labled "VTR" when although
it is a Video Tape Recorder, the rest of the industry and most people often
seem to refer to it as "VCR" as in Video Casette Recorder.)

I did mention those (bottom of my post, as well as other parts throughout
it).
Windows 98SE
800x600 resolution (only DOS allowed less than 640x480 resolution, Windows
goes 640x480 & up).
ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon 7500 (4x AGP, 64MB DDR RAM, Retail).
And also as I said, EQ runs just fine as long as I don't try to drop to
640x480 (if I do, I lose picture until I let it time out & return to
800x600).  And not just EQ, but Windows does the same thing.  You should
notice that when you first run EQ everything from the license agreement at
the beginning, up to the server select screen is in 640x480 size (you'll
notice this by your monitor flickering as Windows changes resolutions).
Then when EQ goes to the loading screen you'll see it flicker back out to
Windows for a second, or your screen will flicker off, as it changes back to
the normal resolution you're running.  As far as I know, you can't change
the resolution the game boots up in (license agreement through server
select), only the in game part (and the character select & loading screens
seam to follow the in game settings).
