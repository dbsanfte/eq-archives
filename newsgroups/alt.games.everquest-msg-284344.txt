Gnomes DO have tradeskills other than tinkering, y'know!  I believe
that book is only for cultural symbols and (I think) charms, nothing
to do with tinkering.

If you're not already familiar with it, I recommend www.eqtraders.com
for all things tradeskill-related in EQ.  One of the guides there
recommends Geerlok Fermentation Device as the best path from skill 102
all the way to 215; if you can farm the Porous Mineral Blocks in
Netherbian Lair it's quite cheap to make.  (My gnome is currently
focussing on Spell Research but intends to try Tinkering soon. :-)
