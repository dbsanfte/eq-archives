No I mean the guys who are just flaming me cus they got burned in
another thread. If they want to argue that's fine but if their just
making idiotic insults over that have nothing to do with other posts
in the thread it's just useless spam that really could be saved for
the next time they do disagree and want to "dress me down". Ah well
guess that means after they've shot their wad I'll still be going and
going. *pukes violently after he realizes what he just said*
