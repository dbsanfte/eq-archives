I can understand waiting on the *perfect group*.  But I do think you should let
people know that: hey I'm waiting on my friend, it's going to take him 25
minutes to get here.   He's got to stop and rez someone, run by the bank in
POK, make a stop in the bazaar and then eat dinner before we can get started.
I don't want to wait half an hour to get started on a 90 minute mission.  My
play time is pretty limited.
