OK, So how is these idiots' actions Verants fault? They can't force people
to roleplay and, try as they have, they can't stop kids playing (that is
mental age as well physical age)
I've heard players say that they can't wait to get to 50 so they can "Talk
shit to people and Kill Steal" I have seen high level (like 58th) players
threaten to force a spawn to be shared (basically take all the kills without
stealing) from the Giant Fort in FM because a Necro there wouldn't leave the
group and help locate his friends corpse.
I don't think any of this is Verants fault. As for those that attacked FV,
hope Verant truly screw their faction with Good Races. Though the GM's
should have realised the mentality of some players and made FV unkillable
from the off.

far more courage than Drink or Drugs
