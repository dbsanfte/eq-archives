Dreadlands is another good place.  Go into the Yeti Cave and pull with a 
nuke.  As long as you pull with a nuke and don't get too close  you will 
single pull every time.    If you see Glacier Yetis, you are in the wrong 
cave, you need to wait a few levels for these.  The other two caves each 
have a wandering Yeti if I remember correctly, so kill him first and watch 
for his respawn.
