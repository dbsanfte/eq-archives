You either have the temperment to play a wizard, or you don't. Nobody
can tell you which is right. No, you won't easily find groups like the
unholy trinity do. No, you don't have many abilities that are "critical"
to an exp. group, so you're not first on the list to be asked. Yes,
you'll need a good guild and/or group of friends to get groups often.

And yes, your class sucks until the fifties, where it becomes "sort of"
cool to play, until you hit 59/60 when you become a god walking among
mortal peasants. ;-)

Stick it out if you can. It's worth it.
