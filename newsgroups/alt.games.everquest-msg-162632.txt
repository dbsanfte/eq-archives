Well, never underestimate the power of the knowledge of having been
there, done that. Your second time up through the fifties will always be
faster than your first because of it.

However, for the rate of leveling Martin's talking about, you'll likely
also need some of the "resources" as well, which he'd likely be unable
to share. ;-)

Specifically, do you have two other level sixty characters on separate
accounts and computers to PL him through the forties. If so, then
certainly, a couple of days should do it nicely.
