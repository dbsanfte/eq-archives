More like around 3kb, but that's not what is important.

Assume there are 100 people reading the thread. The options in
snipping text are
(1) You snip it - costs you about three seconds.
(2) Everybody else scrolls past it - costs everybody else one
    second each - total cost 100 seconds.
So you're wasting about a minute and a half of other peoples' time
to save a few seconds of your own. There's a multiplier effect.

If you don't think that multiplier effects matter, I wish you joy
the next time you are wading through your accumulated spam.
This is the same "my time is more important than their time"
attitude on a smaller scale.
