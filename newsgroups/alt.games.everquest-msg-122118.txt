I had a great time partnering my warrior with a necro.  The necro kept me
healed up, and I, along with his pet, tanked mobs.  Fear kiting was iffy, as
there would have likely been adds.  We went nonstop for several hours, it
was great xp.  It's just a question of adapting to the current situation,
and using what spells are most effective for it.
