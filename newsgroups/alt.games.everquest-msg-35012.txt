I am a lvl 5 HLG Rogue with about 119 HP. I really feel I need to increase
that in order to succeed moving into higher levels. I realize armor and the
such will do that, but I only have 40-50pp to spend at the MOST. Is there a
better (or just another) way to build HP?

What a night it was in Misty Thicket on Vazaelle last night!!!

Thanks,
Phinehas
