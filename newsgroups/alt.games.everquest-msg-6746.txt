Well, this question has been debated to death more times than I care to
count, so let me just give you my take on it:

The best character is the one you will enjoy playing the most.

Wizards are definitely hard. No doubt about it. That's why, when you
create a wizard, the game says "This Class/Diety combination is of
Moderate to High Difficulty". Wizards are not a solo class. They don't
have any real melee abilities, so you're left to try to nuke everything
to death. That gets VERY hard at higher levels (read: anything over 15).
The only real time that you'll be able to solo with your wizard will
probably be in the first 5-10 levels. After that, you'll really want to
find a group.

And, when you get to the 50's, yes your wizard will be a pretty tough
customer, as long as you have a good support group for him. Wizards are
the ultimate damage dealers when it comes to non-melee damage, and they
are the only ones who can open a portal to the planes, so as you get up
there you will definitely be someone who is wanted for groups.

My suggestion, if you get tired of playing him, is to start another one
that you think you'd like, but don't delete the wizzy. Leave him in
there and play him whenever you are in the mood. You're given 8
character slots per server, and there's nothing wrong with using all of
them.

Just my 2cp.

Brent
