Not sure how hung up monks are on ranged weapons, but a preserved
splitpaw eye is also a lightsource? If so, these weigh *zero* and fit in
your range slot or handheld slots and gives you +2 SVP too. They are a
common drop in South Karana (and I guess in Splitpaw), and the level 20+
players that hunt there consider them junk and usually leave
them/destroy them/give them to newbies. I often stick them on bats and
rats in newbie zones. If you auc'd for one for a while I'm sure someone
would just give you one if they happened to have it clogging up their
backpack. As you're in Qeynos, there will be people coming from South
Karana all the time to start the Gem Inlaid Gauntlets quest in Crow's
Bar - bound to be someone with one of these to give away.

Hell, if any newbie within sight of Toxx/BB/WC/NK druid ring wants one
on Morell-Thule, give my druid, Elidar, a tell.
