Valid points all, but completely misplaced. You're right - if my
government did decide to 'tip their hand' their would be issues. But,
like most nations, we are not insanely paranoid. We trust our
government's *not* to do that sorta thing, and they don't. I can
catagoricaly state that I have never been carried off in the night by
secret police. We don't have secret police. That's 1930's Russia, douche
bag. 

This idea Americans have, of their government being in *their* control,
doing exactly what *you* want, is insane. They ignore you - but you just
brush that off. On the subject of voting, you said "What good is your
vote if the government does away with it algotether?". I couldn't agree
more. Which is made all the more amusing by the fact that, at your last
election, in many areas, people's votes *were* done away with
(particularly black voters, I understand) because Dubya bought them off.
So don't lecture me about electoral corruption, please - that cannot
happen here. Oh, I forgot - that's because we are oppressed. Oh
well. I can live with that.
