I've heard the run thru Nektulous is treacherous, good luck with 
that...there are guides that mention a safe way to run thru in either 
direction.

Not really, you can go in but if a guard catches you, you are ported 
out.  Some people have to sneak back in thier old town after betraying 
so they can get the stuff out of old apartments, it can be done.

You don't need to train in a city but you do need to do certain quests 
in order get past certain levels.  Those can only be done in your home 
town.

IIRC, pally is only an option in Qeynos, if you betray (and this must be 
done before level 17), you can only be a shadowknight.  A bunch of 
classes are like that, you don't really have an option if you just grind 
away to 20.

You could always re-roll your barb in freeport, they can start in either 
town according to the official site.

There are reasons behind why you can't betray your hometown after 20, 
don't mean I agree with them but I do know there is a method to the 
madness.
