No, because Invis is *required* to get the group down there.

No, because the mez is *required* to keep the group alive.

Naturally. But again, irrelevant to the point at hand.

The rezzes are NOT required in a hunting ground that is easy to reach
from a sensible bind point (If a melee didn't bind in the closest zone
travel-wise to where he's hunting, it's his own damn fault). The dead
party member can get back, loot, and resume hunting just fine. The
only advantage rezzing gives them is restores some of their lost xp.
It's a convenience to the character who died, not a requirement.

Doing your best to keep the group alive is the job of the cleric and
every other member of the group through their own means. However, when
things go bad, which is often not anyone's fault and not avoidable, it
is NOT the cleric's "job" to give those that died back some of the xp
they lost. Rezzes are only "required" if it's the only way to get the
people safely back to the group. It's common courtesy to rez anyway,
but if a guy who clearly wasn't vital to the group (judging by the
OP's story) is acting like a pain in the ass, IMO it's perfectly
acceptable to tell him to suck it up and walk back.

Personally, though, I would have gone along with what another poster
said, though. I would have given the asshole the 0% rez and told him
it was that or nothing.
