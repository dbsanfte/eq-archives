No no no, you're not getting into the spirit of the thing.
You have to realise that there was no GM to jank Gandalfs corpse out of the
depths or Moria. Ineluki did not test if Naglimund could withstand the
seige. Did you see Frodo complain with his uber ring turned out not to be to
great at all? Noooo sir, he just put it in his pocket and trudged on.
You don't expect Mua'did to stand up to a Great Wurm and say "hold on, this
seems hardly fair, you lot get to have hooks to ride and I have to...."what
do I have to do anyway? No fair, you guys need to be nerfed.

The nature of the quest is not in the reward it is in the journey. If you
want to be babied and taken along by the hand past the great big scary
dragon....you're in the wrong business, my friend. If, on the other hand,
you like a world that is designed not to work properly and being in a
situation where nothing is certain, not even the clothes on your back, than
you're in the right place.

A true adventured doesn't mind being up the creek without a padle. The creek
itself is worth investigating. And never mind about the paddle, downstream
is where the party invariably is at.
But there are always those who get them selves stukc up the padle without a
creek, try to avoid this, go with the flow and don't take anything for
granted, you are on an epic adventure afterall.

There, that kills another ten minutes waiting for this bloody patch.

BTW did anyone in europe pre order from sony but can't seem to track their
package through UPS? 3 days seems a bit long for package to enter the
system, considering it should take about 4 days to reach me. Anyone?
