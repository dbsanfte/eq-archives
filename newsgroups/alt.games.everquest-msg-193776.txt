Its more like this....  if you can't figure out RZ by yourself, you aren't
going to progress to the next level after RZ.

Its preferable to see a guild die, and die, and learn, and learn, and kill
an "instant repop" mob (such as RZ) than blow 3 day rings at the next level,
thus holding back/disrupting other guilds.
