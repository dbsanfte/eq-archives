Nope.  Instead what they get is much, much worse.   A wandering spawn in an
outdoor zone.   One whos usefulness will make his spawning a guild
mobilization race, each and every time.

That was the one thing Ragefire did have going for it.   It could be camped.
Now you've just got what the warriors have had all along, druid twinks sitting
in an empty zone constantly hitting track, praying that enough people will be
on when he spawns.   And that that druid over there on that hill doesn't have
more friends that can get there faster.
