On a side note, all jealousy issues aside, I'm still on the fence about
starting to get AA points tucked away. I know it's been covered here,
and I read up on it, but I just can't decided. The options for the
warriors in the low AA levels dont' sound all *that* great, and I can't
bear the thought of bogging down my xp grind even further. I'm
definitely NOT putting one point into it until I ding 55 and get
Defensive discipline. But after that??? I'm wondering if maybe I could
just stick 10 or 20 percent in for the heck of it and take the advance
run speed, or bandaging, or something. Or just wait until I make Warlord
(Probably in about... 2004) and just switch to all AA after I get a
safety bubble.

At least here, if all I do is procrastinate, the worst that will happen
is I'll level faster.
