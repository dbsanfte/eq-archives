...Monual.

Last night, decided to do another Heraldic smithing run, which means I need
to buy lots of High Quality Bricks of Ore.  So I went to the Plane of
Knowledge, went to the bank, and swapped out all my bags for eight empty
bags which I planned to fill with ore.  I also withdrew my entire life
savings, all 90K of it, rather than try to calculate how much it would cost
me.  I'm not worried about weight because I know my drogmor will run just as
fast no matter how much I weigh.

So I summon my drogmor, and make my way towards the ore vendor.  Climb up
some stairs, across a platform, drop twelve inches down to the level where
the ore vendor is...

...and die.  You have fallen for 20000.  When you're as heavy as I was, it
doesn't matter if you fall as much as an inch.  It's enough to 20K you.

I sigh and run from my bind point by the zone-in to the Plane of Tactics.  I
find my corpse, drag it to the ore vendor, rez it, loot it, and buy my ore.
Alas, the vendor runs out of ore after selling me only 15 bricks.  Guess I
need to go to Kaladim.

So I walk outside, *very* carefully descend the stairs, and walk slowly back
to the bank, not summoning my mount.  I get to the bank and swap out my bags
of ore for my regular bags.  I then use the in-game map to find out where
the Kaladim stone is (handy feature, that) and summon my mount again.  I
merrily begin running towards the stone, which means running down a gently
sloping hill where I manage to fall twelve inches...

...and die.  You have fallen for 20000.  I'd forgotten to deposit the 90K of
plat I had on me back into the bank.

/em sighs at Monual, deeply disappointed.
