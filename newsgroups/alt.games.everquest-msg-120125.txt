You'll have to spell out the difference in much better detail than I've
seen so far.  Was Snare and Fear really intended to turn into fear
kiting?  Talk about abusive, the mobs have almost no chance when
faced with this combo with someone good at it.  How about the miracle
of AOE groups in the end game?  My personal best 32 dark blue mobs
in one kill... but the group I was working in said their best thus far was
52.  Risk of total death, of course, but only if the mobs get lucky or
someone screws up.

The "you two fight" system is gleefully used by bards, chanters, and
to a lesser extent druids and necromancers.  What specifically about
my cleric's ghetto version of this using natural mob vs mob aggro, root, and
carefully timed Root and Atone, really offends you?  I think its my use
of the word Guard... because without using that bit of shorthand, it seems
pretty clear to me that this is really a more difficult way to charm kite, but
one that I, as a crazed "do things as many ways as I can think of" cleric
player, can do solo.

Note that although I -say- guard, really any two mobs that hate each other
naturally will do.  Lets move the example to Lake of Ill Omen, where
the sarnaks and goblins naturally hate each other.  Both hate me.  Now,
if I get them close together, arrange for them to fight each other, then use
root to prevent the winner from KSing me, kill the runner, then kill the
remaining mob... is -that- an exploit?

Consider that I used to kill guards in Nektulous for exp.  No fancy stuff,
just a nice handy killable mob with good loot drops.  Was that an exploit?

What difference does it make if the mob I happen to be using to fight other
mobs with is nominally a guard, then?  With the exception of the newbie
guards at city gates, of course, who are deliberately underconned and
massively overpowered, and who should be left in place anyway in order
to protect the newbies, I dont see the difference between using a sarnak and
using a halfling to kill a goblin.

Bug?  What bug?  Mob behavior dictates that some of them kill
each other.  This has been around since the game was issued, I'm
pretty sure its working as intended.  Root isnt' bugged either, it
stops a mob from moving just like always. Atone, is that bugged?
It erases memory of acts that might anger a mob.  Same as always.
Using these few facts in combination might be a bannable offense
(by some weird stretch of the imagination) but you wouldn't be able
to cite "abuse of bug" as the reason

I know places where a feared mob runs into the zone line and stays
there while you beat it to death.  THAT is a bug.  I know places where
you can jump up and down on and off a ledge, and the mobs will
run to the far end of the ledge, jump down and all the way back
to you while you nuke em, only to jump up out of their path and
send them off on the same path again.  THAT is a bug.  If you
can point out where any of the three factors I name are broken
in some way you can call what I'm doing there exploiting a bug
as well... if not, then you'll have to come up with some other objection.

Oh, and if you think its without risk, think again.  I need to pull mob
over to its enemy, stick root to it and keep it on, watch for adds,
deliberately break root if necessary to let the mob run, root the
"enemy" (who often is normally not KOS to me, but who suddenly
is when the root attempt hits) and evade all the "enemy" adds as
well while finishing the mob.  Is it as risky as meleeing the mob to
death in  the field, as a cleric?  Well no... but clerics aren't built
as melee, we need to use our wisdom to solve our problems,
not our strength.  "Lets you and he fight" seems an elegant little
solution given the clerical tool set.  Not without risk of course,
nor without effort, but viable.

Have fun.
