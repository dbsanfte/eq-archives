Or if you just don't want to group with other people.  THE duo
for going to 60 without depending on anyone else *quickly*
is necro/druid.

Ports to go where they want, tracking to pull the mobs they
want; snares and roots to make sure the root/DoT effectively;
stacking DoT lines; a form of mana regen for both; effective
heals; invisibility to both live and undead mobs; SoW; etc.

No duo can fight as effectively anywhere as a necro/druid.
The only limitation is the loss of the quadding ability but
that's more than made up by the increased effectiveness
of both root/DoT and fear kiting.
