Only Solistice Earring / Earing of Xanthe and the shawl quests come to mind.
You need some decent plat to start those and the shawls at least require you
to spend lots of time on tradeskills and farming items / quest stuff from
mobs you won't be able to do solo . Aside from that get some levels and farm
Elysian Remains in UP. Druids are about the only class that can solo SS+
gear and UP is the ticket. Just don't try it before lvl 55 or so and at
least have some very decent gear (for mana pool).

Midlevel for lots of cash and high end items? Why are items "high end" in
the first place of any mid level druid can get them?
