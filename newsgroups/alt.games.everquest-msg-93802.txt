Just to be aware, getting Thurgadin armour from Kael is quite a bit
easier than killing Trakanon or the Chardok Royals, and significantly
quicker than waiting for other Cobalt drops.  Add to that the fact that
Champion's armour is much better than Cobalt or Incarnadine.

A single 55+ group can clear Kael arena at very low risk.  Two groups
can clear it really quickly.  Trak would take twice that, same with the
Overking, and both quite a bit more dangerous.  Risk v. reward is not
even slightly balanced.
