Those SW corner camps took my druid to 26.
There are what 12 + spawn points on a short timer.
With harmony you can single pull any of them.
A few were green at 24, but all still gave xp at 25.

I was soloing so I just pulled out the blues and never had to wait.
With a group if you can keep all 12 - 15 spawns dead with no downtime
then more power to you.

I agree that the spawns are low blue/high green at 24, but you can just
grind them up. I could solo 2 or 3 non casters back to back, then med
up. With a group you could reap xp in a constant stream.

Good till at least 25 if not 26/7.

Of course this does not change the fact that you may not be able to get
a group there, or that if there are people there they may prefer to try
their hand at yellow tigers, not a good plan IMHO.
