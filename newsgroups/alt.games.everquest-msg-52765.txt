Keep in mind, I don't play a cleric, but here's some general info..

Any fight where your opponent has high MR isn't going to be an easy
one.

vs wizard - a wizard cannot outnuke a cleric's heals. Wizards like to
do shock of lightning to interrupt spells, but if you practice
stepping through it (stepping back to your original cast location) you
will be fine.

vs necro - should be a tougher fight than vs a wizard. They have a pet
to worry about, but you should be able to outheal/dispel/cure whatever
is thrown at you. Root/fear the pet.

vs mage - think a wizard with a pet. You can outheal their nukes also.

vs enchanter - if your MR is low enough that they can get their spells
off on you, you're probably dead.

Stuns are, of course, useful versus any caster.

vs warrior - naturally have higher MR. They don't have mana to run out
of like a caster. If you can root or blind them, you should do fine.

MR is key in any fight. Also, if you can afford them, buy some
pumices. A fight can sway heavily when someone loses their buffs. ;)
