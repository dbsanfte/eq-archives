At 58, I get 20 extra strength from McVaxius' Berzerker Crescendo without
an instrument, while I get 35 with the mace equipped. That indicates a 1.75
modifier. Seems weird to me since all modifiers I've seen have had only 2
significant digits, but if the modifier was 1.8 I should get one more 
strength. Don't have an epic yet to compare with, and can't compare with
bought as I'm currently in Kedge Keep looking for a certain backbone.
