Heh, OK, Jagged Pine is bad for me when I am looking into the forest.  It is
just fine most anywhere else in JP.  Most luclin zones are fine.  The Bazaar
is bad, really bad, if I am looking at the vendors.  Nexus has gotten laggy
lately too, anytime I am looking towards the center.  I can't think of any
other zones I have any real issues with, unless there is a huge crowd of
people gathered.
