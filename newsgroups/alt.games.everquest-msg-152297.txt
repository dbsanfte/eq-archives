Yes. I played on Xev and I went straight there after I got things going and
It didn't have me listed as having any.  I think I may have figured out the
problem tho.  The thing that got me thinking of coming back was getting an
e-mail from sony with one of those free 30 day trials for returning members.
It included an account key that I entered thinking it would just credit me
30 days.  Only thing I can think of is that when I entered the key (which i
believe was for the original game only since there was a link to DL it
online) my account was from that moment on considered the basic game.  Not
sure if this makes sense since I'm not sure how the whole thing works.
Anyhow, this is the only thing I can figure since I even reinstalled the
entire Trilogy but it fails to recognize anything beyond the original game.
Since my station name and pass where the same for both I think it may be
impossible to get it to recognize that it was me who registered the trilogy
and not just the original game.  So I may not be coming back as I would now
have to purchase the Trilogy again as well as SoL.
