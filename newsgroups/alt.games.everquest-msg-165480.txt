Well, I did it because I am a Paladin, and the only 1h piercer i'd seen
that was Paladin equipable was too damned weak for me to kill anything
with it (I gained xp soloing in LGuk while I was skilling up).  OTOH,
and this is more "unverified EQ lore", it seems to me that skillups
have come faster, in terms of number of swings, with 2h weapons than
with 1h.  And I am serious about 100 skill-ups in two not very long
sessions with the Centi Warspear (maybe 6 or 7 hours total).

Yep, I remember, still think the CEnti's a very viable option tho.
