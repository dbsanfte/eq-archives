Well, we're getting into a discussion of butt aesthetics :) here,
but...

If you view, say, a newbie half-elf directly from the side, the butt
doesn't, er, protrude enough for my tastes; it slopes straight
downward in an almost masculine fashion.  And when viewed from behind,
while I grant you there is a pleasant curvature to each lower buttock,
I don't care for the overall shape...too narrow at the top and much
too broad at the bottom.  The old butts, while of course less
detailed, were precisely to my own tastes and I miss them <sniff>.

And don't even get me started on the new breasts (breasts should NOT
be the size and shape of basketballs!).

YMMV, of course.
