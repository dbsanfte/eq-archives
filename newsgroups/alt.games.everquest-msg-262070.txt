 Go to Crushbone and outside Crushbone in GFay, kill all the orc pawns, 
cents, oracles and slavers you come across.  Loot all the orc scalps that 
they drop, which drop in maybe one of four of those.  These are the same 
scalps the High Pass orcs drop, and they're useable for the quest.  You'll 
need stacks and stacks, of course, but you'll get those stacks very quickly 
in GFay and Crushbone compared to High Pass.  If you're singleminded in 
this, it won't even take a week.

I would not advise killing paladins, as you'll find yourself KOS in both 
North and West/East Freeport very quickly, and while that may eventually 
lead to you no longer being KOS in West/East Freeport, you'll be every bit 
as KOS in North Freeport as you were in West/East in the first place.
