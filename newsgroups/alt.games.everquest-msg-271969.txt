So that discounts people who dont have time for guilds. I actually think 10 
is a very low number, I can easily name 10 quests that you need a group to 
complete.

These are not quests.

I'm sorry but again, I wouldnt class making items (some of which have 
nothing to do with your profession, still bugged!) as a quest.

SoE stated that there would be significant number of quests. Sorry I still 
completely disagree with this.

I still have a quest book full of quests that I simply cannot do by myself. 
I have tried to find quests that I can solo but so far no joy. What I have 
found is that a lot of the early quests can be soloed at later levels. The 
problem with this is that by the time this happens the monsters are grey and 
the reward isnt relavent to your level.

Look, I dont want to get into a argument. What I would like to see happen is 
for SoE to add more content for the players who only have a hour each day to 
play rather than ignore us and try to force everyone to group together to do 
everything.
