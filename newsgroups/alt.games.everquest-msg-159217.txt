  I saw this new weapon on Allakhazams and was
intrigued, a 50/44 (level 56 recommended) weapon
called a Windblade, and thought I'd peek at my server's
Bazaar to see if any were for sale.  Imagine my surprise
when early this morning, there were 12 different people
trying to sell one, ranging in price from 52k to 65k.

  Uh, twelve people already have a spare/one that their
group didn't want?  Seems this weapon is going to be
far too common for people to think they're gonna get over
50k for it, no?  Surely the prices on these are gonna plummet,
or Verant is gonna have to nerf the spawn rate or something.
I can just see these becoming the next MoSS, a fantastic
weapon (even if it, the MoSS, is SK only) that you can get for
dirt cheap.
