I've occasionally thought that this would be a good special rules server.
Start it out with the original world (plus the original planes), level limit
50, etc.  Either at predefined times (say every three months), or upon
predefined events (all of Vox, Naggy, Innoruuk, Cazic Thule down a specified
number of times), enable the next expansion.  When it gets caught up to the
regular servers, start over (giving everyone on it an offer of a free move
of one character to another server).
