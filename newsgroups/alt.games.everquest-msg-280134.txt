We've had, what, one billing cycle since the increase? Maybe two for 
some? We're only talking $2-4 at most for one monthly billing cycle. 
Yes, I obviously realize that it's more for people with quarterly or 
yearly subs, but it's not like we're winding up paying more than we 
would have to begin with.

What's all the fuss? They made a mistake. No shocker there, but I hardly 
think we're being treated badly.
