I am, I assure you, a rare cleric.  Naked Wis, 100, naked Str...
I think 125?  I forget.  In my melee-ing prime, self buffed
I was at 250 str (and falling, Reckless Strength or whatever
its called will do that.  At the time, I could click it back off
and refresh it though!)  In case anyone is wondering, though,
if I had it to do a third time I'd go low wis high STA instead
of STR.


I keep my Wis at 200 unbuffed, and have never regretted the
choice to lowball wis at creation... except on the occaisional
long CR!

While I'm told its a better table, thats no more than a theoretical
benefit... personally I never observed much difference.

Given an equivalent weapon, yes.

This missing reports angle bears looking at, never heard of
it before this thread.

Riposte.. not taking riposte into account at all.  Riposte only
works when you are getting hit.  Paladins did not tend to get
and keep aggro, with only double attack and using slow
weapons.  Yes, if you include riposte, all paladins always
outdamaged me.

At 60 I'll be no better off than I was at 44, as far as I know.

When I got the drakkal icegrinder, people in my guild were
aghast at how nice it was.  I would have sold the thing (going
for an astronomical 6kpp) but I got into meleeing with it and
was (once I got skill up... funny how having a hundred skill points
banked up with nothing to spend em on helped there) impressed
enough at how enjoyable it was and how effective, I kept it.

The runewood was a substitute for the icegrinder on my second
cleric... turns out the darn thing isn't dwarf weildable!  Pity,
since I'd planned this time to deliberately make a battlecleric
based on the fun I'd had with the icegrinder... but it seemed
to do the job more than adequately.
