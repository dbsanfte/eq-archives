EQ  said:
}I noticed how you side-stepped the issue about your inconsistency..
}On the one hand, you say little or no harm can be done to a healthy
}adult from a USENET posting..
}On the other hand, you say you have to watch me because I can cause
}you great harm from my USENET postings..
}Geeeeee.... Let me think on that one....

Ahh yes, more famous EQ tactics:  twisting the words just enough to create 
the semblance of a contradiction where there isn't one, then claiming the 
contradiction wasn't addressed in a post that addressed it rather nicely.

Or, if we should successfully address your 'concerns' of a contradiction, 
disparagingly writing it off as 'tap dancing'...

Which leads me back to my other conclusion:  Reading is Fundamental.
