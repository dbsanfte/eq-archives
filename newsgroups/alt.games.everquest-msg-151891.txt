Perhaps this is related to a client/server communication problem?  When 
the client thinks you are dead, but the server thinks you are alive, you 
get a message somewhat like this.  That's what caused the complete heal 
death bug a while back.  It would say "You died." with no reason.

I'd say be sure to /bug it.  And let us know whether it's an exp death 
or not.
