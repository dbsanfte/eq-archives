No, we didn't make that link.  We also looked at things like the timing and
lack of lead-in.  If Dubya was after the oil, he would have moved in after
claiming that Iraq was in material breach.  He would have moved in after our
unmanned planes were shot down.  He would have moved in the first time Iraq
fired at our hardware.  We would have Saddam's head mounted on a pike
outside the White House by now.  Let's face it, two years after the WTC
attack, and the Middle East hasn't been turned to glass... take from it what
you will, but I think it reflects well on Bush.
