AC 5 HP 55 rings are quite inexpensive, and you'll miss 55 HP more early than you will
late (although you'll always miss it)

I haven't tried a blind character in quite a while, perhaps Sony finally saw the (lack of)
light and fixed it so its no more than a slightly different coloring choice.  Used to be
incredibly annoying for a barbarian to hunt in BB, die, and have to go kill enough stuff
to loot weapons to sell to be able to afford a new light source to run and loot his body.

Of course nowadays you don't lose your gear on death until 10th level anyway, and could
always POP to Qeynos and avoid the tunnel... but back in the olden days (decrepit old man
voice) you sure learned early how horrible night blindness was.

Why I remember the Tox forest being the stupidest newbie zone ever, as dark as Nektulos
but with a night blind race hunting in it, I literally couldn't find my way back to the
zone for 50% of each game "day".
