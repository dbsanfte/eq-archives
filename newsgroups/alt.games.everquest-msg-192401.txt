I don't know if they are connected but I saw something strange a few
days ago that I had not seen before.  We were preparing for a run
through KC to get VSR and were killing some things out front.  Our
bard charmed a MOB or two, and at some point, a pet from a person in a
different group began attacking our bard.  In your case and in this
case, both charmed something that would otherwise be an enemy of the
other player's pet.  Consequently perhaps, both charmers were attacked
by the other player's pet.
