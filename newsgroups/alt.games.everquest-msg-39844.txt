Actually, i think they swing at the same time if a person looks at the time stamp
in the log file. What makes it seem that the off hand swings first is the
animation. It seems that the animation for swinging makes the off hand occur
first. Animations should never be trusted in cases like this. Always refer back to
the log for information.

BTW, I think this discrepency in animation and actual swinging is why people
occassionally seem to swing a weapon at the end of a fight a few seconds after the
death of a mob. The attack had already occured but the animation of the attack had
not occured yet. That is a problem when weapons get faster and faster and players
get haste. How do you measure a half a second in animation display time that would
result from a weapon that is swing every 1.5 seconds? :)
