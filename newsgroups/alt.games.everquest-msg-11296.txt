Those were some of the milder ones. There was worse. Lines I have
screenshots of:

/shout I get dips on CT's loot!
/say I will never heal you again, Firiona!
/say You will die you slut!
/say the Unicorn says he's horny
/ooc paying 100pp for invisibility!
/ooc SIT ALL U BUT RAPING MONKEYS
/shout Grrr DO SOMETHING YOU STUPID AVATAR
Rytain is filled with the spirit of water
/shout someone cast levitate on the faceless
/em kjqfxr on The Faceless's feet.


ok, the monkey line makes me laugh. And I didn't shoot any of the
harrassing lines.
