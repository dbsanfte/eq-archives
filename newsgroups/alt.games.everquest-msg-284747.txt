That one's easy. The exact same thing that doomed EQ2 to "failure" before 
it ever got started. The designers were more concerned with making a game 
they could exert complete control over with regard to all manner of class 
balance, that they forgot that gameplay is king. 

Oh yeah, and while they felt for some bizarre reason that Star Wars 
wouldn't be Star Wars without an uber pet class, they just couldn't find a 
place in their vision of a Star Wars universe for the likes of functional 
droids.
