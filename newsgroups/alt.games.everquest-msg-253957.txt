And this is precisely why you are an idiot. Corporations do not and can not
pay taxes. The only entity that can pay taxes is individuals. Corporations
can collect taxes from their owners, workers, or customers but every bit of
money you tax out of them comes from a private individual.

When you start to tax corporations weird stuff happens. They move where the
corporation is based. It gives a selective advantage due to pricing for all
coporations in other countries who are not so stupid. Or they just use
creative accounting to hide all the profits. 70% of all corporations in the
us payed 0 tax last year. Young jhonny gets sent to the welfare office to
fill out the extra tax credit paperwork since there is a tax credit for
hiring him.

Taxing income is also fairly stupid since it causes people  to stop or slow
down working. What you really want is a nice asset tax that leaves
everything else alone. Something like the following would work best though
it dosent have a chance in hell :)
