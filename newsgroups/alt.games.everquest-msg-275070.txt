I'd say that those quests should be marked as group.  If you have to
kill group encounters to complete a quest then it should be marked
group.  If you can complete the whole quest without defeating a group
encounter then it should be soloable.  They have already assessed every
encounter and it should be fairly trivial to develop a process to
determine if you can complete a quest without doing a group encounter.

I'm fairly sure that the con message says that the encounter is
"well-suited to a group of three or more" not that it cannot be done
solo.  That's all I want - an indication of how many a quest is
well-suited for and I think that it should state the con of the most
difficult step.

With one of my earlier examples I wouldn't have started the Cauldron
Hollow access quest because it requires a raid to complete and I'm very
unlikely to be in a position to join a raid.

I wouldn't know how to con the lightstone quest though.  The difficulty
is that you get a useful item at each step in the quest.  Is it
actually a number of small quests followed by a number of progressively
larger quests?
