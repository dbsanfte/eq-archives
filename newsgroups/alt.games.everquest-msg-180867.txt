Well we have settled on the need of an Enc, Sha and a Cleric. Now for
the melee, we're torn between Monk and Pal/Rng combo (or Rng if Shaman
slows are 100% successful) for stuns, or an SK and Rng combination for
snare, and track. My friend has a pretty good RP story for a SK, but
I'm afraid the damage they can do is subpar being that our 5th buddy
(the 2nd melee), won't show up every time we do log on and play (we
may have to 2-box him). :(
