Thanks for the info.  I bought a "Crystalline Robe" for 300pp (50pp less
than what someone on http://www.everlore.com/items paid back this past
March).  By the way, look at that site and see the average cost.  THAT is
EXACTLY what I DO NOT trust sites listing prices.  Only as a general
reference, not as absolute.  They're saying average price is 4Kpp
(outdated).  This robe has following stats.
AC10 INT+6 AGI+2 MANA+10 SV COLD+10 SV MAGIC+5 (WT 2.0)

I like the colors on it too.  The decaying green looks appropriate for a
Necro. The brown trim with blue stitching on it (giving the effect of a blue
stripe over a thicker brown one) matches the Dark Elf look allot better.
The down side is that not only is my LV12 Gnome Wizard (exists but not
played since I started my Necro, realizing my TRUE class), is wearing a
"urine yellow" color robe, now my Dark Elf Necro is wearing a "diarrhea
green" color robe.

Robe looks great (if you consider it "decay green" rather than "diarrhea
green"), good stats (at least for my LV) and another 4 AC should help me (I
don't tank, but nice to have the AC for running away).

Any other good items I should start saving for?
