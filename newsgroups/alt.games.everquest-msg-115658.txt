it's funny how life works...within the past couple of weeks (or since
i've started watching .hack//sign - anime about an mmorpg - mainly
subbed by an anime fansub group called Elite Fansubs - where's my
advertising money?), i 've been thinking about playing eq
again...anyhow...

tonight, i saw the movie "The New Guy" and heard/saw some Everquest...
"ads" in the movie. there was lil' inside joke about something like
"this is real life, not everquest".  not to mention one of the
supporting characters wearing eq t-shirts. 

it's strange, all these things; an anime, a movie, and...not to
mention the hype about star wars galaxies...comming out all at the
same time.  must be some cosmic conspiracy to get me playing eq again.

boy is it working.
