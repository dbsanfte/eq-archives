    Bats in general seems to see through. The Lower Guk bats are even more
of a hassle, being right along the usual path into the deeper areas of the
dungeon.

    The mobs that can see through won't attack a Brell worshipper that's
never taken a faction hit there. Well, the mobs that can see through Hide,
