I spend more of my time in a group than solo right now... but I only group
with people I like. I'm learning more about my class this way, and what I
can do. Today, I got half of 30 at gnoll spires, grouped with a cleric and a
rogue. I was teaching the cleric tricks I wish I had known at that level,
and it was possibly one of the more exciting groups I'd been in. Earlier
this week, it was just me and a Beastlord. Most of the week has been me and
a wizzie. Each group has different styles, and solo is again different. I
like our flexibility.

I don't think necros should go looking for a group- we should make them. =).
Let's take the other "rejects" and have a good time.
