1. How do I get Tanik Greskil to spawn?  I been searching around Kael
Drakkal entrance for hours and have been ambushed by death squads 3 times
but haven't found Tanik.
2. Am I allowed to give him the velium vapors the first time I see him?  I
got bored of searching and went and got the vapors made up.  Will it work if
I just give it to him the first time he asks?
