Monday night I was playing my newly minted lvl 2 Monk in Qeynos on FV.

A higher level Monk wanted to hire me to kill Frogloks in the
catacombs, because he couldn't get netted gloves (magical) due to TLC.
He leveled to far past the 2-5 Frogloks.

Even from a RP point of view this is stupid. If a character is strong
enough to kill a mob, he should get whatever it drops. TLC is a stupid
and foolish method of forcing players to interact and help each other.
It only breeds frustration, and resentment.

I am not a "pharmer" (and I never will be), but I am the type of
player that wants to be self-reliant. I want to be able to hunt and
kill for the items that I will use. "Uber-Guilds" and people with
multiple accounts can still "Pharm" to their hearts content. Only the
"casual" and 1-account players suffer when TLC is implemented.

Language Barriers, Alignment Barriers, and Bind-Point restrictions
should be more than enough challenge on the new FV RP-preferred
server.
