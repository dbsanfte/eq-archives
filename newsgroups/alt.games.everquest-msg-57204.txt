I've always wondered about this.  Does it calculate the possibility
or actual frequency?  I've noticed my Ranger's apparently natural
ability to taunt.  My friends and I play a group of hybrids.
At the time we had a Pally, two SK and me, the ranger.
Just for kicks, sometimes I'll let everyone else engage the
mob first.  I'll let 3 or 4 combat rounds go by.  Then I'll
step in and hit auto attack.  In what seems like 50% of
the time, the mob will agro on me with the first strike and I never
hit the taunt key.  This is when we where all 12 and 13 in the
Warrens.
