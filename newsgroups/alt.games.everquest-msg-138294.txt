...based on your level and class!

Please repeat after me:

Weapon damage bonus on is based on your level and class!
Weapon damage bonus on is based on your level and class!
Weapon damage bonus on is based on your level and class!

Ok I am sick of seeing people auction their weapons reporting
the damage bonus. Don't do this, its stupid and a waste of time.

Saw an argument last night on the auction channel
between two nitwits about what the damage bonus was
on a weapon.

Please pass the word. Let's stamp out ignorance!
