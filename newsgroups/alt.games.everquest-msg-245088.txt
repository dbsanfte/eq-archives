But that's not the problem here. Plus in my experience Mobs do not get 
stuck in 'geometry' there *are* pathing bugs, but that is different. 
Mobs are not inhibited by geometry the way PCs are. Mob models do get 
stuck in geometry, but this is a client side visual artifact, and the 
mob is elsewhere. (You'll note that a mob can walk through a rock, 
although the model might get stuck on the rock you can't hit it... and 
then 20 seconds later it warps past the rock... in reality the mob never 
stopped you just couldn't see it where it was supposed to be.

This situation actually supports  my client/server 'you are too far 
away' theory earlier in the thread.

He is simply experiencing a clientside geometry/rendering problem.
