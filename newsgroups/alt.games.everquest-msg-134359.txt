Have downloaded about 80% fo the files then got hung, haven't been able to
get past the 'checking files' message since, it's just congested by all the
slow analog modem users out there. They should autodetect high-speed users
and let us download and get it over with to clear the download server faster
so all the slowpokes can get on.

(totally kidding, of course :P)
