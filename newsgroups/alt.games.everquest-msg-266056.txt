It's well documented that being a nerd places a strain on the wallet 
comparable with heroin addiction, dating Jennifer Lopez, or having 
septuplets, but it's true that it also places considerable demands on 
electricity.

After buying the upgrades for my PC, it occurred to me that it would be 
a good time to 
organize and label the mess of power cables at the back of my desk (and 
to vacuum the dust bunnies out of there, too). My computer room is set 
up in the spare bedroom, which only has one double electricity outlet, 
probably because whoever planned it wasn't thinking beyond a table lamp 
and a radio alarm clock; so obviously after a few years those two 
outlets had grown a dangerous-looking daisy-chain of power strips, a 
veritable viper's nest of cables, and a positive mountain of power 
blocks.

So I went off to the local electronics store, got myself a 6-outlet 
surge-protected strip with built-in power meter and a 8x conventional 
one (I *know*, I should get a UPS one of these days), to replace some of 
the chained 4-outlet strips, and some adhesive labels to know what went 
where.

After an hour or so, the resulting list went beyond funny, past scary, 
and well into WTF territory:

Mac
PC
Left Monitor
Right Monitor
Mac Speakers
PC Speakers
ADSL modem-router
Printer
External Firewire enclosure #1
External Firewire enclosure #2
Mains-to-Molex adaptor for external IDE to USB adaptor
External Firewire DVD burner
Digital Camera charger
Treo 600 charger
Powered USB hub
Desk lamp
Cordless phone charger

And I'm sure I'm forgetting one or two... As it is, they fill completely 
one 8x power strip and two 6x ones. As it is, I think I should be less 
scared of dust bunnies and more of the whole damn setup becoming self-
aware and eating me. Or just going up in flames.
