Are you sure about the wizard? I think with Wizards they are more useful on
raids and places where nuking is needed to finish off a big mob, but for
dungeon groups I usually see wizards shouting LFG for hours untill they give
up and gate out. Don't think I was ever in a group where we chose a wizard
over say a tank or a rogue/monk/bard.
