I have a similar tale after I got RS3 and was with my SK friend in wakening
lands killing sentients for SK armor. Bad pull he FD or dies or something
and I got aggro from about 4 suits and couldnt do anything about it. Camp is
near kael where im KoS so I decided to run aaaaall the way to skyshrine and
thats a very long way. So anyways all I have is RS3 and they couldnt hang.
Without it they would have easily caught and killed me.

<3 RS3 <3  and FU to the H8'rs.
