Also not on your list, but something you might enjoy is Legacy Online.
I've been hooked for about a week now. Haven't heard anyone else talk
about it yet.

From the site:

-Massively multiplayer persistent world. 
-Real-time strategy with deep sim gameplay and high level of community
interaction.
-Influence the economy and politics of an entire planet. 
-Build an empire, rake in the big bucks, then run for Mayor or even
president!
-Just like real life, the game offers a challenge for the savvy
entrepreneur at heart.

It's a little different, but in a good way.
