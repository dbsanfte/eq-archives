can get to 191 entirely on store bought stuff.  can get to 226 without
foraging (Halas Meat Pies).  unfortunately all the really nice stuff (misty
thicket picnics, hero sandwiches, etc.) require quite a few forages.  that
said, if you can find fruit/vegetables in the bazaar for a reasonable price
(say, 1-2pp each), misty thicket picnics will turn you a very nice profit
even at 5pp each.

can get to 248 on entirely storebought items (be aware, one of them is nine
items).  however most the good stat drinks require foraging (qeynos
afternoon tea, surefall ranger juice).  i think you can make kaladim
constitutionals (+5 STA, +5 SvAll) with ground spawns, so that's useful.

post 200, this gets _really_ expensive.  i've also heard the skillup rate is
insanely slow since the nerf a while back.

i hate fishing.  i need fishing to make tormentor stir fries on my baker,
and surefall ranger juice on my brewer.  i figure hitting the fishing button
is boring, so i'll just go buy a bunch of fresh fish and skill up by
filleting it.  sigh.  600pp later and i'm at a skill of about 60 :/

that said, you can fish while LFG to pass the time, and it doesn't go up
_horrendously_ slow.  i went from 4 to about 50 by hitting the fishing
button for a couple hours in EK.  also foraged a few stacks of tea leaves.

wood elves start with an innate forage skill of 50.  unless you're playing
on FV, i'd suggest just starting a WE druid/ranger alt and lvling 'em up to
26 or so in paludal.  should take you about 1 or 2 nights, and it'll get
your foraging skill to around 150.  you can also look for a foraging machete
in bazaar, or try questing for it (be prepared to spend a few hours in mons
letalis hitting forage though), it has a nice +10% foraging mod on it.

baking cost me about 500pp to GM.  jewelcraft about 3k.  brewing so far is
around 50pp at skill 213.  so far i've just about broken even with
jewelcraft, and made about 200kpp with my baking (can sell fish rolls and
patty melts in the bazaar pretty much as soon as you can make 'em.  people
like banquet size meals that weight 0.1 for some reason :).  YMMV ;)
