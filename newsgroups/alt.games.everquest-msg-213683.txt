Saw it.  The 14 minutes is part of the charm of Ensnare, but far from its only
advantage over necro snare.

The comparison isn't between darkness and nothing, though, its between darkness
and Ensnare.  Druids and rangers get a snare that sticks better and is cheaper
to cast (and to recast).  What you have to convince me of is not that
snare/darkness type movement debuffs are a good thing, I'm very aware of that.
Its that a snare thats short duration and expensive and has the drawbacks
attached to damage type spells vis a vis mezzing is better than one that simply
snares, does so cheaply and more often and lasts longer.

Also, PvP is about 1/10th of 1% of the game, and isn't really all that relevant,
with many spells being deliberately gimped in PvP combat, so you can't charm
kite or fear kite, and the damage all spells do is cut down by a third, plus
sensible PvP players tend to load up on resist gear thats not really useful in
95% of PvE gaming but is massively effective against players that don't have
unresistable resist debuffs... in many ways the balance is radically different
than PvE.

I don't follow you here, whats the relevance?  Oh, that the tiny amount of
damage that you do with the DOT portion of Snare is a way of doing some damage
so as to get more exp when your victim dies, without using up an added spell
slot?  I guess thats a benefit of sorts, as long as you don't need to do any
real damage, just a little bit.  Druids have lots of clicky DOT items if they
want a damage producer that doesn't use a spell slot, though.
