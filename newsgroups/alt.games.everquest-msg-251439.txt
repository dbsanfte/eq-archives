"thouights"  ??? are you making a point of someone else's typos?  Nice

"Lets"  actually you mean Let's.  And what is up with SHadowhaven?  Is this
a new proper noun Mr. Grammar Person?

"I can be a criminal killing guards, and doing as I  please, because I can
always sell and buy in the PoK."

should more correctly be written:  I can be a criminal, killing guards and
doing as I please, because I can always sell and buy in the PoK.

the dependent clause "killing guards and doing as I please" would be set off
with commas, as you have written you are referring to the subject of the
sentence "I" as a criminal killing guards, implying that you are guard who
is a criminal killer.

Since your harangue (or if you prefer - rebuff) over "poles" was so
important to you to flame someone it would follow that you would like to be
so much more precise in you expository.
