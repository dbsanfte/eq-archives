Sadly, I've already read it several times.  I loved it, but was hoping to
stumble on some new and good reading material.  I have to say, my tastes do
not agree with many others, as it seems.  For example, I thought the Shanara
books were horrible, and I was fool enough to read 2 or 3 of them (I think
there might only be 3, but you get the idea).

Next to LoTR, my favorite fiction includes the aforementioned Beowulf, Alice
in Wonderland, The Three Muskateers, Count of Monte Cristo, and especially
the 10 books of the Amber series (Zelazny).

I have read plenty of other books that were so purely crap -- Ivanhoe
springs to mind -- that I sometimes fear I've read every book that is both,
high quality, and suited to my tates.
