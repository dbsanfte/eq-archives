I had massive stability problems until I figured out a few things.

Heat buildup.  Make sure there's plenty of ventilation around the machine. 
Try taking the cover off and aiming a fan into the case.  See if that makes
it more stable.  When I did this, my lockups and reboots went from once an
hour to once every couple of days.

But how to get rid of them entirely? This is the one that really solved the
problem for me.  Check your BIOS settings.  If there's one in there for
"Turbo" or "Fast" mode, set it to "Normal".  Once I did this, all my lockups
went away.  I was even able to put the case cover back on.
