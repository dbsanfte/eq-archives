It was that originally and there is only one version - EQ2 is only about
to go into beta, but there a number of expansions available which is
probably what you are seeing as versions....any of those expansions are
playable with the basic game or alongside people with different sets of
expansions so they are fully compatible.

THe playstation version came out a long time after the PC version and Im
not sure if you play on the same server boxes or not. As such it would
surprise me if EQ2 was due anytime soon on the PS. What expansions are due
to come out on the PS I don;t know either - but have a look at the EQ
website for that.
