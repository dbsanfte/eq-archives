   Interesting point.  I wonder how many of that 3550 are EQ'ers
who are just there to scope out the nay sayers.

    3550 sounds like _alot_ of people.  But... where is the
support group for those of us who are happy that our men are into
EQ?  I personally am delighted to know that Lenny wants to come
home at night to play with me, rather than going to a bar or an
arcade or whatever to find his fun.  It gives us a mighty common
ground we can discuss our interest in.  We've been very happily
married for over 16 years, and I count the ones that he's been
playing EQ as among the best.  So where's my support group, so
that I can point to the numbers it has to see how it measures up
in comparison?

Annie
