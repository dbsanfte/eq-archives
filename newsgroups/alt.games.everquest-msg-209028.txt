On Torv, it tops out pretty much every night. But, to see that, you
need to be in the bazaar at seven or eight a.m. EST, which is often
when I'm logging out my trader. Pretty much every day that I play, I
pick up something that is sellable to other players for more than it
is to vendors. In the last week, I've moved blue diamonds and trade
supplies from BoT, quest items and finely-polished gems from Tactics,
spells from Ssra, all sorts of things from Chardok B, and pelts from
power-leveling in Scarlet Desert.

Even if you're a more moderate player, averaging 30 hours a week of
play time, you're pushing pretty close to the cap. Throw in a
half-dozen overnight trading sessions and you're over. Hell, spend
three days logged in waiting for some epic spawns and you're halfway
done.
