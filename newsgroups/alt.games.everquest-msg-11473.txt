Hopefully they did it like this:

Loot_Value=## where

00=Normal
01=Magic Item
02=Lore Item
03=Magic+Lore
04=No Drop Item
05=Magic+No Drop
06=Lore+No Drop
07=Magic+Lore+No Drop

Then, if they haven't already done so, they could just add.

08=Quest Item
09=Magic+Quest
10=Lore+Quest
11=Magic+Lore+Quest
12=No Drop+Quest
13=Magic+No Drop+Quest
14=Lore+No Drop+Quest
15=Magic+Lore+No Drop+Quest
