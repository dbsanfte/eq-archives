Well if non of you have ever gotten bit by the guard at the book you are
lucky.  We were setting up a Guk raid, and decided "books are always safe
from roamers" so we all gathered at the book.  Along comes a level 48+ (red
to a 45) guard that wiped everyone that didn't click the book fast enough.
WE went back down and started to rez everyone when guess who shows back up
and wipes a couple more people.  We finaly got everyone situated, and ran
for GUK. We did a bug report and a petition, but the only answer we got was
that it was a feature of the new pathing system.  They are supose to roam
the swamp.

Now for a little rant.  Why is it that the roaming guard in a newby area is
level 48+ and hits for 200+ for the Good too shoes frog's, but for us pore
Dark Elf's our outside guards are all around level 20.  I watched a level 18
paladin take out the guard to lavastorm Mnt. yesterday.  Now I understand
why he was never any help with those undead.
