Now you have. ; )

It's a lot of work to maintain, as you can see from the DKP link, but the
payoff is definitely worth it.  A high end raiding force that is well
equipped, experienced and still completely open to the public.


I personally think it's worked very well.  We've gone from wiping out on
Vindicator and Velketor the Soreror, up to Public North ToV raids with only
2 deaths (besides the pullers) and 5 named dragons, including Aaryonar,
dead.  Another first last night, Lord Venymm, completing our return from a
long vacation of raiding PoP targets.
