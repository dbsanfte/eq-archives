Thing is, there's no reason to nerf solo XP (if that's what's been done) or 
even to boost group XP all that much, is there?  There are *inherent* 
benefits in being with a group, presuming that your groupmates are 
competent -- killing more mobs (and *harder* mobs) and dying less = more 
steady XP.

I still find it sadly amusing that the rogue, a class whose name implies a 
go-it-alone lifestyle, is highly dependent on groups.
