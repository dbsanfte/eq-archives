It depends on the class.  Other than the issue with Katta's Song of Sword 
Dancing, the bard boards are remarkably free of whining about the class.  
In fact, when people start asking for ways to fix the bard class, many 
posters get defensive saying that bards are already balanced and powerful.  
(I suspect this has something to do with the perception that balance=nerf 
that permeates the EQ community.)  
Some classes just seem to whine more than others.  Some of it is 
justified, and helps get broken classes fixed, but a lot of it is just 
spoiled kids complaining because they want everything given to them.  

Arolpin
happy bard
