Not a dangerous train, but I was bored and decided to amuse myself.  This
was on my monk in LOIO.  I was sowed, so I ran around the windmill area over
to the spirit caller ruins and gave one kick to every sabretooth tigress and
tiger I could find.  They formed  a neat little pack behind me, and I ran
over to the windmill and feigned.  It was very funny seeing about 30 tigers
milling around the windmill area.
