Of course you're completely right.  The fact is "newer" members of the guild
said things like Brad quoted.  The established and experienced members knew
full well what they were doing was the ONLY way to win the battle.

The bridge is just a tactic and Brad makes far more of it that it was.  In
fact he is saying this "purposely using world geometry, aspects of the hate
list, the "z"
coordinate and its nullification of NPC's ability to summon, and multiple
atmospheres (e.g. water/land) to arrange dragon-type encounters so they
could attack without getting hit back for the vast majority of the time that
it took to kill the monster." about the bridge tactic, of course he's
completely wrong.

The truth doesn't matter and never has to Brad or anyone else at Verant.
The Druid playing VAKs will be along shortly to cover Brads' ass.
