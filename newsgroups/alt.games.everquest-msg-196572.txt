:
: I have toolbox in one of my slots.  It is weighs 3.0, holds 8
: items, 0% weight reduction, and holds GIANT items.
:
: Inside I have 3 things - Birthday cake, flasks of water, fish rolls.
:
: When I click on it (put it on my pointer), my stats have the following
: changes.
:
:    AC  +30
:    AC  +2
:    STA +5
:    AGI +5
:    DEX +5
:
: My weight does not change.
:
: Why would picking up the toolbox (which has no stat enhancers and
: is holding no stat enhancers) result in all those changes?

You probably have stat food/drink in anouther container.  By taking this
container out of your inventory you have made it so no food or drink shows
up above the stat food/drink..the same thing will haben if you trade the
spot in inveintory that these items are in.

Hope this helps.
