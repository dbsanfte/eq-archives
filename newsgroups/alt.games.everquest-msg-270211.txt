Needing to scare up some plat to buy a rune or two, I leave my character
in the Bazarr overnight, hoping someone will buy my Earring of Oppression
or Sleeves of Constriction.

This morning, I wake up to find that there was a patch, and I'm back at
the login screen.  Seems I always pick the wrong nights to go trader...

Anyway, at some point during the process of exiting EQ, I get a window
that tells me there have been some ungodly number of unsuccessful attempts
to log in to my account.  I don't remember the exact number, but it was
at least ten or twelve digits long.

Could this actually be correct?  Did some hacker have a machinegun pointed
at my account?  Or is it likely an artifact of being logged in when the
server was brought down?  Has anyone else seen this before?
