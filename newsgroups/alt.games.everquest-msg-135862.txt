I try very hard to be clear, and to always ask if there's any questions
concerning clarity.  I've been told by a couple of people that I put too
much effort into this, however, and that it would be better to just take
things at face value, not give examples of my own, and not to ask for
clarification.  I'm glad to know that there are others out there like me who
want to know what other's mean, and aren't afraid to ask.
