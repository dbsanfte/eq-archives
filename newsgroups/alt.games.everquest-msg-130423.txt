I have to pipe in on this one, but if you FD and have a DOT on the mob, even
after you stand, it will not re-aggro 100% of the time.  I've tested this
(not knowing I was doing so) several times, and have had the "Dooming
Darkness has worn off" type message after I stood up and Goner was, well, a
goner.  No re-aggro when that happened most of the time, and the couple of
times it did happen I believe was caused by the larger aggro radius of the
creature "under attack" and my being a bit early.
