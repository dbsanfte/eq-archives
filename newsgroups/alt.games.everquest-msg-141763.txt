    This one is much harder to make, but if you have some 250 skill brewers
from the Coldain Ring days see if you can coerce them into making it:
Kaladim Constitutional: 5 STA 5 all saves. Might shave 1 STA off, but I'm
guessing that STA is only useful when you solo. And I'm also guessing the
saves will come in more handy than the 7 HPs (with ND 3) from the 1 STA.

    IF I could get some of my guild brewers down to Kaladim to make
Constitutionals, I'd be soooo happy. Between those and the Misty Thicket
Picnics I use now I'd be 5 STR 10 STA 5 INT 5 WIS 20 HP 30 MANA 5 all saves
up. That's good eating!!
