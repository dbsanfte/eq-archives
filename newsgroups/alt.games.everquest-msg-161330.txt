   Ok, what  good place to start.  This is my first post to this group, 
I am comming from the Ultima Online group. I played both 5 years ago for 
a month or so each and quit. Now I am back playing and I've been on UO 
for about 4-5 months. An in game friend of mine left UO after 4 years 
and is now in EQ. First of all do I need to buy multiple boxes of 
software to get all the "planes and worlds" or can I buy the new Planes 
of Power and have it all?? Thanks for the help, I'm not even a newb yet, 
because I havn't started, but I think I saw a free download and one 
month trial on the web site....
