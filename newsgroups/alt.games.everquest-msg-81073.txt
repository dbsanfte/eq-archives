The answer is no, it does not more than make up for the added member.
Ideally, you should be killing mobs enough faster with 6 people that, in the
long run, you earn xp faster.  If this is not the case, then your group is
too big for what you are hunting.  It is not always desirable to have a full
group, it all depends on what and where you are hunting.
