Yah. Yesterday, when trying to get a glimpse of
the Big Chickens and then having to run away quickly
when I got caught in two of the AoE spells that had
me down to approx 40% life, I ran right into Veltar
and ended up dragging him around the zone until he
got tired and left me alone. :) Tracking is pretty
useless with the amount of people who were in the
zone. Looks like things are far away when they're
*right there*.
