funny you said 90% -- 
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4510&source=Live

monks do have an ability to reduce their incoming damage, and in fact, they
have several

ever since the /disc system got redone, monks have been a little worse off
....

stonestance used to last forever, and though it was supposed to be 90% off
incoming damage, it was more like 60% or something

the reuse on it used to be only a few minutes, but now it's like 40-ish, and
the duration is around 15 seconds


also, why would you want anything to be automatic? ever? nothing is
automatic except DP/DI, and that's because the game wants to tell the story
of the gods themselves reaching down to do something for you....

and since you made this comment (sorry to sound antagonistic now), you
probably don't about the discipline of voiddance at 54 - it removes chance
of being damaged by melee, very useful for when you know you're going to get
pummelled

there is, i believe, another damage reduction/removal discpline, earthwalk?
not sure, my monk is not 65
