Iksar's have a 20% racial experience penalty. This is in place to
offset their racial advantages (regen, AC bonus, infravision, forage,
etc)

Humans have 0% experience penalty. This means that when a human monk
earns his 5th yellow bubble of exp and "dings" a new level. the Iksar
only has 4 yellow bubbles filled in. Iksar innate regeneration can
help them by reducing downtime, but the 20% penalty is still
noticable.

So over the course of 65 levels a human monk would be "easier" from
the stand point of gaining exp and faction issues.
