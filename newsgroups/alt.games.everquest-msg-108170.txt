Grouped with a few ppl yesterday one of them was a 14 or so wiz and we
started of by fighting crocs in oasis so then got a few others so decided to
move to hwy.
This wiz took it upon himself to pull and immediately pulled about 3-4 orcs
which killed a few of us and left me low on health and mana. I sit down to
med and tell the group and he just runs off into the hwy again bringing back
a few more???? I get killed.
3 times I died went from 19 back to18 eventually told him to sort his own
pulls and disbanded.
