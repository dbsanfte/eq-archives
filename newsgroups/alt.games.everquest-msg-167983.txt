Once again, I cannot disagree more.  nVidia has made 3D support on
their cards STANDARD.  The reason wicked3d isn't around anymore
probably is because nvidia made their licensing fees disappear.  I
understand your frustration in your personal situation, but how can
you say it's going nowhere when the largest chipset manufacturer in
the world takes is seriously enough to put standard support on their
cards?  Let's just hope Matrox and ATI follow their lead and at that
point it would clearly imply that the future IS 3D.
