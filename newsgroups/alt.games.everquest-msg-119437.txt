You sir neglected to read my post.  You managed to not only misconstrue
what I said, but even more sadly, you missed the note I tacked on the
end for folks just such as yourself.  If you looked more carefully you
would see #1 that I  didn't say that pulling a mob to a guard to kill is
an exploit, what I said was exploiting the guards is an actionable
offense.  There is a difference between those two statements and I stand
by the one that I did make and more importantly #2 folks such as
yourself who want to twist things around to the point where actually
exploiting the guards would be considered acceptable are handled by my
attorney Larry H.  Bring your cup if you are planning on going a few
rounds with him as he seems a bit ticked off about something lately.
