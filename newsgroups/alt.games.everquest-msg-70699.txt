More or less a "ditto" post here...

We were warned that our hardware probably needed updating/upgrading a couple
months ago.  It sucks, but it's not surprising.  A family on a budget had a
couple months warning.

We were told LATE IN THE DAY on the 4th that 8.1 is, indeed, required, and I
don't think it was until the next day that anyone was told officially that
Win95 users were...err...SOL because of SoL.

I doubt if Joe Average knows or cares much about ebay.  Joe Average goes to
Best Buy to buy his software and Win98SE is $99 there.  If Joe Average
hasn't snarfed a copy of Win98/SE from a friend yet, chances are he doesn't
have a friend with a CD-burner or the knowledge to do the upgrade the better
way (copying Win98 to the hard drive before running Setup from there).  He
might also be against software piracy.

Let's see...a hundred bucks for a surprise upgrade for his own enjoyment
less than 3 weeks from Christmas, or those 3 presents he wanted to buy his
kids...tough decision....
