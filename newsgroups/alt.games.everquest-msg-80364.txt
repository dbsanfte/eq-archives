I think I may not have been clear in post.

What I find interesting is that they can alter an item's stats -- even
retroactively -- without requiring a player to turn it in for a swap. But
they seem to do this almost exclusively when nerfing an item. When an item
is enhanced, or altered in a genereally beneficial way, the item usually has
to traded to a GM.

That is the point.

I apologize if I wasn't clear and my point eluded you.
