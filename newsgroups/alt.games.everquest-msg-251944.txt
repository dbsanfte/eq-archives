I rejoice in my ability to read.

I'll spell it out for you. I don't believe I ever mentioned quantity
of cpus except to say I had been a console operator on a cray with 8
cpus.

oooh. See that word teraflops in the bit you quote ?

Its nospam that is on the 'flops per cpu' kick.
 
] ONLY THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE PERFORMS IN THE TERAFLOPS RANGE. 

I know that. Why don't you know that ?
