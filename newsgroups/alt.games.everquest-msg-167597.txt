Well maybe one day when I'm high enough lvl I'll come hunting you and we can
experience the joys of PK together... be sure you have plenty of coin on
you, too, I could use the loot :)

VAH BST Tunare
Sullon Zek

P.S.  Actually I probably won't ever be high enough to fight you since
you'll be lvling as fast as I will -- but I couldn't resist the opportunity
to unload some dire threats on one of my beloathed enemies [sic].  :)
