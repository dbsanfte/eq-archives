I thought it was one of the worst excuses for a game I have ever played, 
but apparently the fun is in getting high level and joining a guild and 
having huge wars with other guilds for control of land/castles.

The game up until that point, however, is like trying to play an old 
shareware RPG with no quests and no point other than just killing ugly 
looking graphic MOBs.
