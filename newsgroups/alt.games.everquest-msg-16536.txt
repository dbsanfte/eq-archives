>I am not sure. i think i do i havent figuerd it out if i have Schizophrenia
>or if i have some other disorder

And this isn't the place to find out.  Not wanting to be around people, and
"hearing little people"  can be anything from a schizoid personality disorder,
to various forms of anxiety or  panic  disorder.  Yes, peopole with panic and
or anxiety believe th ey hear a voice in the wind, running water, back fo their
head and so no.  It sounds like your attempting to describe paranoid
schizphrenia, but it is very unlikely that a person with this disorder would
trust the computer and all of "us" out here, aftera ll, your television,
computer, radio, or dog is usually giving your messages.   On the bright side,
if you are not simply taking up time, and you are in fact schizophrenic (
though I doubt it, AND this is not a diagnosis ) you are not florid, but
perphaps prodromal meaning thaqt you are not feeling the full of effects.  So,
you make an appointment and see a psychiatrist because you will need
medications.  There are MANY medical conditions,  drug addictions, withdrawls,
anxiety disorders, and so on and on that could be causing your symptoms.   If
you decide to totally disregard the advice to seek medical attention (hospital
ER if it feels like an emergency ) then find the schizophrenia forum.  I'm sure
they have one.
