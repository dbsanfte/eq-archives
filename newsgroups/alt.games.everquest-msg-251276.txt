Where-as I'm really happy (and I'm a wizard).

Nothing more annoying that to be bugged in PoK for rides to PoH.  If you're
getting 30 members of your guild up there - you aren't gonna use the NPC
approach (assuming it's one person per stone), but it's nice for stragglers
to be able to get there on their own, or people who want to solo there,
without having to bug a wizard.
