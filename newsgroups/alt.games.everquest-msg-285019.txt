Some weapons have proc rate mods which increase or decrease the rate of 
any proc on the weapon.  Augs placed into a weapon inherit the proc rate 
mod of the weapon and hence will proc at 2ppm by default (primary hand, 
average dex, no CE, no WA aa)

Note, only one proc is fired, even if a weapon has multiple procs they 
are checked in order and as soon as one fires, no further checking is 
done that swing.
