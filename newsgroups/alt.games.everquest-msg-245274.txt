I recently rolled a ranger, and put forage on his left turn key (which was
disconcerting on other characters).  I soon had quite a few veggies.  I put
them up for sale on my trader without rechecking the prices.  Before I even
turned on my afk flag, all my veggies were bought by joestrader--when I
checked he posted them for sale for 15 plat each--I had them posted for 1
plat.

I no longer sell my foraged items, I give them to guildies who are bringing
up their baking skill.  I have to thank Teapray for that suggestion to me on
the serverwide chat channel.
