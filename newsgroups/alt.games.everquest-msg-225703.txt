Which pop through are you getting? I was getting LDoN then that crappy Lords
of Everquest RTS one. Now it appears to be back to LDoN and the MoTD is
throwing Lords of Everquest in my face everytime I logged on as well. The
SOE marketing department is really starting toget under my skin and I am
trying hard to ignore it...  *twitch* ...there is a very strong stench of
contempt for customer base being given off by them.
