And sometimes that's the right thing to do. The average grunt doesn't 
know the big picture. If the general orders a suicide mission perhaps, 
just perhaps, it is the best course of action.

We have every reason to beleive that Abraham 'knew' his son would be 
welcomed into heaven. The only hardship God was really asking for was 
for abraham to give up the joys of fatherhood. From the perspective of 
the chacters in the story, 'death' was on par with sending him away to 
live with his 'rish uncle across the sea'.

So he's not 'that' omnipotent. I can live with that as a premise for the 
debate.

Of course we can't differentiate the good  reasons from the 'bad 
reasons' from 'down here'. Even in hindsight.

Perhaps the inquisition prevented the a deadly plague from spreading, 
and God figured bent a corrupt and misguided church to exterminating 
what would have been the carriers and saving the human race.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is so, or even likely. I'm 
playing devils advocate...Its just to highlight the point that its 
entirely possible for one to accept that 'the inquisition' was part of 
God's plan, and ultimately played a part for good.

Personally I don't buy it. But the view that everything that has 
happened, and will happen happens because God wills it, and he has good 
reasons for willing it is a legitimate, consistent world-view. One that 
can't be disproved.
