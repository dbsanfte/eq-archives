I buy greenies for my dog.  She loves them, it's the only chewie that 
she's ever taken, she doesn't really go for rawhide or any other thing 
like that.  When the greenies get small, I agree that they could be an 
obstruction hazard.  But think of it, you don't let your baby play with 
marbles, so why would you let your pet continue chewing on something 
that is small enough for them to swallow.  Responsible pet owners should 
always supervise use of any chewie. Rawhides are worse for obstructions, 
they just don't get the bad press because owners are told from the getgo 
that rawhides aren't really digestable.  The point about greenies being 
digestible is they are edible to a point, if you let your dog swallow a 
whole piece then you should know that that is a wrong thing.
