    Yes, that bottom icon actually brings up the spell book.  Too bad, it
would be nice to be able to mem more spells.. .:)

    From what little playing around I did on test with it, I'm not all that
sure I like the new interface.  Of course, much of my dissatisfaction may be
from the fact that it is *completely* different...  I do, however, like the
fact that you can have seperate chat windows...  That way, I can have a
window just for guild chat, and a window for everything else... I routinely
miss guild chat, especially in the heat of battle...

    As for the spell icons... yeesh... completely different, and appear to
be even more lame-looking than before...  But, hopefully, this will help
prevent just about every Druid's sorrow out there...  Confusing SoW with
Snare... Heh.. :)
