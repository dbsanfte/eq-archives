It's more than that.  As a hated necro, it's uses for traveling are
invaluable.  You can pass though almost everywhere without fear of your
invis dropping at a rather inopportune time, also.  Root-Rooting and don't
want an add?  Insta invis and you can watch the mobs buddy blithely pass by.
I can even imagine them saying "You know, Ralph doesn't look good today.  It
may be the gruel that was served for lunch, it didn't taste quite right, you
know."  Need to FD and the mob won't wander away?  Stand and pop invis and
they won;t come after you ("Damn! Corpse popped before I could loot!  Now I
have to camp anothe necro, and they are tough!")
