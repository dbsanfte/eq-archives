Heck, I'm more than happy to be paranoid, especially where Verant's
coding is concerned.

Just take a look at the exchange about today's patch message,
specifically "Tradeskills [...] now take [...] buffs into
consideration." That alone gives ample reason for paranoia in general,
if you ask me. Which you didn't, but there you go anyway.

It becomes more and more obvious that they're not using good OOP
programming practices.

At least with faction, there are some ways to test if it's working
correctly over the long term. Of course, a failed test can mean
recovering your corpse out of the barracks of some guards that had
previously been amiable towards you, but it would make for pretty
unmistakable results. :)

But yeah, in general, I *really* know what you're talking about.
