Lance
	Thank you for taking the time to write this up.... sorry about
my majorly delayed response...  Oh and ya compaired to me.. you are
the Bard Guru....  My bard knowledge is limited to having a bard in
group... but I have songs turned off and have the bard buff window
hidden....  but I guess ill have to turn that stuff on if I go the
Bard Route.

Thank you again.
