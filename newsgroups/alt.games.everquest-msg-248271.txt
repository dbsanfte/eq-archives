Going to grab them yes... but if its not ready, and there are obvious 
problems... they will still be availble for the next title to grab 
provided it comes out within a few months.

They aren't going to get hooked by the action or invested in their 
characters if the game is buggy, with login problems, crash to desktop 
problems, and broken content problems...

Getting there first isn't necessarily a win. If you bungle it badly 
enough the players will still be uncommitted when the 2nd game 
arrives... and if the 2nd game is delivered well it will win.

Exactly.

I thought you just said "It's my intention to try both of these games 
when they come out."... :)

If EQ2 comes out first I'd still try WoW... its a different management 
company with different ideals... and EQ2, no matter how good it might 
be... it is still SOE, and all that that implies, and I haven't been 
satisfied with that. :)

If WoW comes out first, I'll probably pass on EQ2.. I didn't even bother 
with the beta signup. I just don't care about EQ2... and won't even look 
at it unless I'm disapointed by WoW.

Yeah.
