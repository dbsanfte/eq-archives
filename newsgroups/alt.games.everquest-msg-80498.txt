A buff is a beneficial spell cast on you. The buffer is the person who
casts it, usually a shaman, druid, or cleric.

A "buffer" is also the experience you get after earning a new level so
that you don't lose your level after death.

(Working on getting a buffer in 53 for Plane of Sky as we speak.)
