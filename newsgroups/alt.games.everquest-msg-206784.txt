One last bit of advice... Know your limits and be proud to play the game
the way you want to play it.

I've got a friend who's quite the Bazaar maven. Made tens of thousands of
plat buying low, selling high. She loves it because she can chat and shop
and still drop everything to manage the kids at a moment's notice. And
she's not going to take her L24 enchanter out to xp grind until she's got
200 Int and a horse. A horse?! At level 24?!?! No way can I compete with
that, and I don't, and that's okay with me. I ooh and aah over her enchanter's
new Planar Robe of Uberness, and she cheers me on when I upgrade to batskull
earrings. Different strokes, and all that.

And when people laugh because you want that last bronze armor drop from
the goblins because it's an upgrade (it's happened to me), just laugh along
with them and wear it proudly!
