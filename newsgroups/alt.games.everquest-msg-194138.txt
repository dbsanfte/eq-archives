Your guild must operate WAY differently than most. As a former high-end 
raiding cleric I can tell you that if you sent me tells like that, they 
would just be ignored. The corpse next to me gets the rez stick and a /say 
%t REZZED macro so that the other clerics see it's already done.

Has always worked very well in any guild I've been in and avoid the clerics 
getting tell bombed (BTW, they already usually are getting tons of tells).
