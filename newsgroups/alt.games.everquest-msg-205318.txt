Sorry for responding to my own post, but there were a couple of things I
wanted to say

First and foremost, thanks to the people that offered to help me out. It
turned out I didn't need it, but it's nice to know that people are generally
helpful. I can see from one of the posts that there are definitely worse
places to die. I guess that these are things one learns as the game
progresses. It does seem as though the MOB's that appear are either easily
dispatched or too tough to fight. There's little risk associated with dying
at low levels. I guess your strategy has to change as you begin to level up.

When I wrote the initial post, I was pretty bummed. It wasn't so much dying
as the hour or two I spent either on the boat or on one island or another
with not much to do but fish. I was actually trying to play it safe. The guy
who killed me seemed to come out of nowhere while I was looking inside one
of the huts. They had said something about a dwarven smith that was on the
island. Many games I have played place nice items in out of the way places
like this. I'll know now to always keep my guard up.

It was actually very easy to get my stuff back. After thinking about it, I
got the spare backpack, pulled out the hand drum, started up Selo's and I
was back at the dock in no time. This time instead of boarding the boat, I
took the translocater. He popped me back to the island and there was no
problem from there. I still hadn't learned my lesson,

I had that translocater send me to Freeport. I was having a lot of trouble
trying to get out of the docks area. I had read somwhere to watch out for
the rogue's guild. When I had stepped into the port authority the first
time, I swear someone cast a snare on me. Maybe my connection locked up or I
bumped into the dooor, but I was convinced that was the wrong way to go.
Then I got the bright idea to swim around to W. Freeport. There was a guy
standing on the shore who I thought was fishing. He attacked me and the only
thing I could do was try to get to shore. The last thing I saw was my corpse
under the water.

Now I was really ticked, but not at the game. I'd been really stupid and
paid for it again. Instead of moping this time, I just headed right back
over. No food or water (my spare backpack was on my corpse, under water). I
did manage to scrouge some food by foraging. It really didn't take long to
get back there. Found my body (that corpse locating song can be useful). It
took three dives to get my gear, but no one attcked me this time. The best
part was that when I finally made it to the Bard's guild, the two songs I
made the trip for cost me half what I had read online.

All in all, it was probably a good experience. I learned ther are some real
dangers to travelling solo. But I also learned that you can find a way out
of most situations. After travelling through several zones, I do wonder
about one thing. Are there items that are cheap in one area that will fetch
a higher price elsewhere? I don't think I've had more than 10pp at any one
time, I sure would like to find a way to make some more money.

Anyway, thanks for the help and advice. To answer one question, I'm on the
Quellious server, but since I work nights I usually don't hook up until 3or
4 AM. There are only a handful of other folks on there at that time. Most
seem to be soloing anyway. If amyone else has any similar stories I can
learn from, I'd love to hear them.

Thanks again,
Curtis
