I've been farming Elysian for our guild druids and I've gotten about 3
copies of SoE for about 4-5 evenings of killing them... Cleric spell
is much more common (forget what it's called) I've only seen Foliage
Shield drop about 3X in all the time I've been there, but it does
drop.  Go for the Elysians and nab some armor for you or your druid
friends in the process.
