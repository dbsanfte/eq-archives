After looking at the statement and what you said to him, I think he
was making fun of you, to your face. From what I have seen and heard
about Sims Online, is that it is lame. He probably thought after you
said this that "what rube", and got his jollies off on messing with
you. Sometimes the most sinister thing you can be, is outwardly nice.
