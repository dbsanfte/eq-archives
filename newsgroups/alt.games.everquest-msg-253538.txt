Was in the local EB today and saw that GOD was down to $19.  With a $10 
coupon in my pocket and nothing else I was interested in buying, this 
was hard to resist, an EQ expansion for ten bucks.  Even if I end up 
quitting EQ within the month, heck, I pay more than that for single 
player computer games I get tired of within a month.

Box has some silly totchke (sp?  I'm not a natural yiddish speaker), a 
useless looking map, some ads, and the CD itself.  Not even a two page 
mini manual, amazing.

So, how to get to GOD zones, and what should I know about in there, 
other than that most of them are entirely beyond me, and the few that 
aren't are beyond me without a full group of like 65s?

Anything else I should know about, for example the Tribute thing?

What about Berserkers, I haven't seen any kind of real rundown about the 
class, and the name doesn't suggest much to me either, other than that 
they are probably some kind of warrior type class, like we needed more 
of those.  I'll probably want to try one out but will likely get bored 
of it in ten or twenty levels unless there's something about it I'm not 
aware of.

Dammit, I really meant to not buy this expansion till I at least got 
some invites to go group there!

Splendid One
