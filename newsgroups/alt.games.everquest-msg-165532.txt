Those are all good ideas on how to make the downtime part of EQ
less boring.  I, myself, read a good portion of the Wheel of Time
series during my EQ downtime.  Thanks, SOE?  :)

Of course, this doesn't address the fact that many gamers don't
have a 12+ hour block of time they can use (even while doing
other things) to get some rare item.  I think that's a design
mistake.  (But I could be wrong -- it's just that nobody has yet
responded telling me why long camps are a good thing and why
there is no way to replace them with something better, such as
quests with a lot more steps, but each step being shorter in
duration.)

: like i said, that camp was a rare event.

It could be that I'm overestimating (perhaps a lot) the "long
camp" problem that I perceive in EQ.  Perhaps the vast majority
of rare items are available through other means (for example,
quests that involve a lot of shorter steps, rather than a few
really long camps).  But based on what I see here in AGE, people
get frustrated with the long camps relatively frequently.

: What true colours would they be?  That people who demand and expect items on

Then you have no cause to be pissed off, because I certainly never
demanded or expected items on a silver platter.  Remember, I'm not
advocating making people do *less* work to get rare items, just
making it so that work can be divided up more.  (Which, again, may
be a naive approach that won't work -- it's just that nobody has yet
told me *why* that wouldn't work.)

I never told you that you didn't have a life.  I really think you
just misunderstood my comment in another post.

: If you say "im a 52 druid, i tried to camp the AC to make phat money!  It
: didnt pop!  I QUIT THIS FKIN GAME!"  then I'll tell you to shut the fuck up.

But...why?  What good can it possibly do?  If you just enjoy bashing
people, that's fine, just say it.  If not, you should realize that
that kind of response only results in a huge flame war.  If that's the
kind of posts you want to see in AGE, that's fine too, just say so.
Just so we're all clear on what your intentions and expectations are.

: whining like they have a god given right to something that rile me.

Well, we're all certainly allowed to get annoyed and fire off a
flame sometimes.  My comments are more directed towards the people
(and they know who they are) who followed up every single rant post
with flames.
