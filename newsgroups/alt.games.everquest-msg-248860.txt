First, the point is I don't wish to phase up as a tag-along through 
drops  -- I want to get them myself (not solo, but with a group of like 
minded people). Unfortunately such a group of like minded people is very 
transient at the casual play level due to varying advancement rates so 
having 30+ regulars to do this with is not viable.

Second, even were to I phase my character up through drops I'd be no 
further ahead... the encounters I could one group would now be 
pointless... the only thing left to do is tag-along through *more* 
drops... or seriously commit to modern endgame... somehting that I don't 
have the time for.

That is also the situation even when one drops out of hardcore to 
casual. I had the gear. I had the AAs... I had nothing worthwhile to do. 
(So I rolled up some alts on a different server... there is lots of 
duo/trio/1 group content from 1-55 that leads to upgrades...) But for my 
main... there is nothing to do do. Sure he can go 1 group velious but 
whats the point??

Every upgrade I see is fairly modern raid encounter.

For the character that always was casual.... I suppose he could 
eventually equip himself out in LDoN stuff quite respectably... but 
eventually that runs out. (and is hellishly boring after a point)... and 
he'll have no content he can challenge either... at least not worthwhile 
content. I suppose 1 grouping Velious endgame will at least have 
novelty... even though there won't be any upgrades.... and that still 
presumes you can find a group to do it with. Non-trivial at best.

Wasn't it you that argued 3 guys with a bot army could do it a few weeks 
ago with the proper macro tools? :)

Surely they wrote tools to assist debugging?

Given insider knowledge of how the event is supposed to work, along with 
'debugging' tools -- macros/scripts, slow-motion, infinite mana/health, 
the ability to pause and examine/tweak the current state, save & 
restore, (ie if there is a wipe -- reset to 5 minutes before the 
wipe...), detailed logs, etc etc etc...

At least... that's how testing should be done.

So we agree then?

You assert that someone EP and beyond is able to one group Velious 
endgame. That sounds like the more hardcore crowed at the moment.

But the casual player? He won't be EP and beyond for another 6 months to 
a year. GoD will be old hat by then... which is in line with what i claimed.

Other than the distaste I have for the suggestion... it doesn't even 
solve the problem. What is worthwhile to do for a casual deguilded time 
equipped player in EQ?

One group Velious endgame? Sure can do... but whats the point? How is 
that worthwhile?

That was my point...
