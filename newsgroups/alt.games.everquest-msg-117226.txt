Hmmm .. don't remember typing 'inferior' or any of it's derivitives anywhere
in that post.  Boring .. yup, I'll fess up to that.  Had a blast with him
really until 47-48 ... now he's just medding.

I don't need to be the hero, just need to be ... well ... active, I suppose.
If I wanted to play a class that's inactive in a group except for the
occaisonal spell, I'd pull my cleric back out.  And to be honest, sometimes
I prefer that mode ... watch the health bars instead of the action, click
twice (once to target, once to cast) when needed.

But generally speaking I like to be doing something.  My wiz does something
in a group... my chanter does something in a group ... my SK does something
in a group ... seems like my druid either meds when soloing, or preps the
group for action then meds during the action in a group.  Just need to be
doing something active, otherwise, I may as well be cleaning my golf clubs
or reading.
