Heck, there are plenty of places in Kunark I still haven't seen! I'd
better get a move on.

This sounds like it provides for a *lot* of interesting possibilities.

>b.. All new, highly detailed player-character models

Will this apply only to the new race, or will all PC models be updated
for the people who buy this expansion?

>c.. Massively enhanced 3D graphics engine

I'd really like to know what this means. We all know that the current
engine is primitive. Visually it's not too bad, and while I wouldn't
mind visual improvements, I wouldn't be bothered if it didn't happen.
However, from a performance point of view, even with the recent DX
upgrades, it's still a dog. I hope 'enhanced' means cleaned up and
optimized.

Who is going to be the bookie for this one? I'm placing a bet on March
2002.
