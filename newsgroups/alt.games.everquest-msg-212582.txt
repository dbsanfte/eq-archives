What's the difference?

Now, you know where I stand on this topic, but you don't need to resort 
to an omnipotent god to deny there is such thing as free will. If you 
were *truly* omniscient, meaning, if you knew the position and velocity 
of every particle in the universe, you could predict the future with 
exact precision, as the choices we make ultimately come down to chemical 
reactions in our brains triggered by external stimuli. If you don't 
believe in a ghost in the machine, the belief in Free Will becomes as 
difficult to sustain as if you believe in an omnipotent god.

Mind you, there *may* be actual free will, but that's pretty much down 
to quantum mechanics, and the jury is still out. As far as I'm concerned, 
"free will" is the state in which you *believe* you have a choice, and 
that's good enough for me.
