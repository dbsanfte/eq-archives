As mentioned in passing in a different thread, got him at 7 pm on Friday
night. Took fully five minutes to get everyone in the zone and start the
pull. (Only about sixteen "on site" when Rage popped.) There was another
guild there that also started flooding in. Checked with us and backed
off. It was very clean and worked out great for everyone. We even
volunteered to help the other guild's cleric next time Rage popped.

Like I said, differt strokes for different .... umm... servers, guild,
etc. Not so say it hasn't gotten ugly on our server, but thankfully it
seems to be the exception rather than the norm.
