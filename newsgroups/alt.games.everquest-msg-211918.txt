You'll be pleased to know that there are zones outside of PoP with higher
ZEMs than those in PoP.  Oh wait, no you won't because that would mess with
your point.  :P

It was new experiences.  Not new experience.  Oh sure, when they were
exploring and found out that PoP not only had a *decent* ZEM (not great,
decent), and that the mobs actually were high enough level to be challenging
and (here's where you're probably confused) give the "higher-level-mob"
experience bonus, they decided to stick around.

When I PL, I use Palludal Caverns (Luclin), Lower Guk (original), The Grey
(Luclin), Crystal Caverns (Velious), Sol B (original), the Hole
(semi-original), Karnors (Kunark), Sebilis (Kunark) and Plane of Justice
(PoP).  And I know I definitely fall on the power-gamer side of the spectrum
of EQ players, abandoning places that are too slow or inefficient quickly.

Old world zones become less used because of A) loot, and B) people like new
things.  Which makes C) the experience to be gained while PL'ing,
D)elightful.
