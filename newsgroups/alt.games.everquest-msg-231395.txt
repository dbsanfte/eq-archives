|OTOH, it's hard to believe those are really Gods when you see them die.

	They don't die, though, only that avatar dies.

	Death is temporary for everyone in the game marked by Order or Discord, so
it shouldn't be surprising that it doesn't "take" for gods, either.

	That said, it is certainly defensible to deny the gods "worship" in
Norrath.  It is not really a viable philosophical position to deny their
existence, though.
