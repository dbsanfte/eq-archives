I thought this discussion was related to experience grouping. If you're
doing an experience group pre LDoN, you only have to do something like
that once, then the spawn is broken for the duration if you're any kind
of puller at all. Besides, there or In LDoN, you're better off asking
the cleric to pacify that wasting a lot of time trying to do complicated
splits with feign.
