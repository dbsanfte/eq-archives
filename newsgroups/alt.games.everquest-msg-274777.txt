More or less. The world wastn't so big that your friends couldn't make 
the trip in under an hour if they wanted to, though.

This is primarily a flaw in the way they did expansions. Its not a 'must 
happen' eventuality.

1) They made the world bigger but didn't put more people in it.

2) They had an aging player population but didn't adapt the existing 
world to it, they just plunked new content on at the edges for them, 
leaving vast newbie regions under populated.

4) They allowed mudflation to occur without the slightest attempt at 
revitalizing, or even utilizing existing content. Rendering it 
irrelevant, and thus empty of life.

5) And most importantly they designed the game in such a way as to 
reward players for grinding out to max level as quickly as possible. The 
idea in EQ that the game starts at 70 is ridiculous. This has greatly 
led to the problems finding groups at the low and midlevels. Nobody 
wants to *play* EQ until they've hit level 70. Too many people think the 
first 69 levels are a grind-fest.

This is dumb-as-rocks stupid. There is a ton of stuff to see and do at 
20th, 30th, 40th, 55th... but few people even bother with it. They don't 
have to and they dont need to, and EQ is designed in such a way that it 
really doesn't even benefit them to bother with it. 

OoW content doesn't *build* on older content, it replaces it wholesale.

A single player RPG is a journey from level 1 to max level. For some 
reason EQ has allowed it to become a race from 1 to max level, and only 
then does the journey begin.

This eventuality could and should be avoided.
