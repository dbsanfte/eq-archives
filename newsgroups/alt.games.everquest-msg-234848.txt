Hello, All

...before we see a level 65 Berserker running around, after the
expansion goes live?  :D  I swear I remember a Froglok hitting 65 in
*well* about 8 to 10 days after that expansion went live!

Oh, and, Sony, if there is ever another race brought out, I want it to
be something *impressive*, like Centaurs :)  Heh, the Kermits seem a
bit of a flop, since they don't seem to be very widely played, at
least on the server I use.
