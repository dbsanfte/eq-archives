I'm confused now.  I've tried my best to report this bug, but I sure
can't type anything inside of the bug window that pops up.  I've
clicking on the window, using the tab key... nothing works.  It just
shows a description in the box about reporting bugs, but there's no
way that I can type anything inside of that box.  I tried it on both
of my accounts with the same no-go results.  It's probably operator
error on my part, but I've tried everything I could think of & it just
doesn't work for me.

P.S.  My enchanter's pet has attacked my Druid 4 times now (3 times
today).  All in different locations inside of Burning Woods.  I use my
Druid on the second account to buff the enc & pet.  But they are not
grouped together.  Also dropping the wolf form on the Druid make no
difference. He still got attacked.   It's ready an odd bug, because
the  pet will attack at random.  Even started attacking the Druid
while I was just sitting there.   It's ever annoying having to watch
my pet all the time.
