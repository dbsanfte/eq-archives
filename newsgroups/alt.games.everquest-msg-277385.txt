Just to finish this off, I got lucky and found some people also doing these
quests, and we finished them off very quickly, although the last bit
(running from npc a to click thru dialog to get to npc b etc ...) was
painful. Oddly enough guards still draw their weapons at me but they don't
attack. I suppose that's as good as can be expected. :P

It would be nice if there was an ingame bulletin board for people looking
for quests, or perhaps a LFQ marker with a description field. I got invited
to lots of xp groups but there's no point when you are xp maxed, can't bank,
etc doing anything else.
