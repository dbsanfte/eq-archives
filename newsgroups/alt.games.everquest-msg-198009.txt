All those CIHYS jokes in AGE finally paid off!

No, not really.  A very good EQ friend of a couple years has
finally pulled up stakes and quit the game.  She logged in one
final time to find me and give me all her stuff.  Took a while,
actually, stripping down several characters of all gear that
wasn't no drop, and loading up two mules of mine with the gear,
even after selling off a lot of the cheapest stuff to vendors.

Cash totaled out to around 20Kpp, and thus far my mule has raked
in another 10K in the few times I've put him on in vendor mode,
what with the obscenely long patch and all.

Didn't get all that much for my toons out of the 'haul' as her
droppable gear was usually worse than what I had, or not wearable
by my classes.  Its a total windfall as far as cash goes though,
more cash than I've had on me at any one time already, and more
pouring in.  I'll probably blow it all on twink gear, of
course...

I'd far rather have had her keep playing though, tried to talk
her into just cancelling the account with the gear on it,  since
people have logged  but no joy.
