Jboots are only hard to get when TRYING. Without trying my druid
twinked my dark elf cleric in jboots at level 12 and my troll sk in
jboots at level 21, both with no help and both totally unplanned. 
With the dark elf I was bored and since no one else was at 4 am, I was
killing the PH spot in oot a few times. After killing the oracle once
and what not and coming back, AC spawned the 4th ph. 

Boom, ran dark elf from overthere to mountains of rathe, logged,
logged on druid, druid got and dropped rapier on ground (before last
for 30 minute thing) dark elf picked up, nearby ogre dueld and killed
dark elf just in case so rapier on corpse. Hasten showed up then
anyway, boom jboots. 

With my troll it was even weirder. Druid logged off near the AC island
in oot. Server was down for a patch, I tried to get on a certain time
and coincidently it was right after server went up, I ran over and
boom, ac there, plop dead. After my 5 minutes of running around and
celebrating I come back and then 2 int casters had shown up and they
go "sorry camped = /" I said "oh darn" and did not have the heart to
tell them they missed it by 20 seconds ;) Boom, troll runs to mountain
rathe from overthere, by now there was the 30 minute no drop item rule
so it was even easier to xfer rapier. Boom troll gets jboots.

That is really pretty true. Druids are usually controlling a mob
anyway if their speed runs out so no biggie. My dark elf and troll
loved the insta cast though. The next person who'd get jboots would be
my druid.. perhaps for fear pulling ;)
