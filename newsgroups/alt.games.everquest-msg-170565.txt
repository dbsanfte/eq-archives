I had some spare time today in the bazaar, so I made a survey of
cons, starting with some random data points, then looking for
specific levels and using  /bazaar to find them by name so I
could con people of the correct levels.

(conjecture) Levels 68+: Red
(conjecture) Levels 67 & 66: Yellow
Level 65: even con
Levels 64 thru 55: Dark Blue
Levels 54 thru 50: Cyan
Levels 50 thru 1: Green

Conning player characters, there were no different messages for
64 and 55, so there's no way of knowing where in that range
someone lies.  Possibly mobs still give this sort of message, I
really haven't paid any attention.  Possibly the different
message thing was eliminated with the introduction of Cyan.  The
dark blue text is hard for me to read, and I always forgot which
was the "high dark blue" and which was the "low dark blue"
anyway.

Since figuring out that message thing at last was one of my
goals, this was dissapointing, I can't tell a level 64 mob from a
55 mob!

Pinning down 55 as the bottom of the dark blue range was
informative, though, as was 50 as the bottom of the green range.
This means I could actually look up hunting guides and see if I
can find some soloable dark blues at the low end of the scale
somewhere.
