rofl. :P I know what universal means, and I was responding to "IE is not 
a universal browser" from 42 and the idea of a 'universal browser' is 
just a wonky thing to start with. What would a 'universal browser' be? 
It'd be one that everybody that was online had. Well... what browser 
fits that description better than any other browser (first person to say 
AOL gets a pththththhtht in their general direction)? So, short of 
saying universaler and universalest (spell checker is gonna hate 
those!), I was stuck saying 'more universal.' *shrug* I assumed people 
would know what I meant. I suspect there's a lot of assuming other 
people are going to know what is meant rather than what is said in this 
thread as I'm still confused over what 42 means when he says (or she, I 
guess I don't know the gender of the answer LtU&E) 'universal browser.'

But 42 already USED the term. So the concept of a 'universal browser' is 
out there. If SOMETHING has to fill the slot what comes closest? There's 
only one answer to what comes closest to being a universal browser that 
has any relation to reality and not leetism or computer savvy 
oneupmanship and that's IE.

love it, love it, love it. Converted all my coworkers to mozilla variant 
users (although wish I hadn't one person because he keeps referring to 
it a Mazolla and I just want to kick him in the nuts when he does it... 
can't he even READ? ARGH!!!!) Yup, best browser out there IMO.

Now if only they'd include activeX support with it built right in.
ROFL KIDDING!!!!
ducking and running like hell. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
