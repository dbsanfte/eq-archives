You, sir, have the advantage of hindsight here. Have you even considered
that aspect? This may be difficult to grasp, but not all newsreaders
post/read immediate postings. I don't know how yours works, but mine
opens new threads of interest from the topmost down as it comes to them.
I answered her(?) post as I came to it. In reality, it's OOC for me to
even interject in a legitimate debate or a flamewar because it seems to
eventually end with more tripe than bacon. However...

If it's no bother, go back and read Suineko's post, then read her reply
to it to get an idea of what I read before I replied to her. At the time
I wrote, I believe only Serefin and maybe Quindell had responses listed.
I did NOT "try to paint her" in any light. I replied to her RANTING (her
words, not mine). In your hindsight, you gave your "readers digest
condensed version" of what you think she meant after you read her
reply(s). Again, I didn't have that advantage and I certainly didn't try
to read between the lines. I stated what I thought at the time about her
post. If you would bother going back and reading EXACTLY what she ranted
about that solicited my reply, NOWHERE in that post does she mention
anything about what she heard "on the radio" or television, and for that
matter, I didn't hear any of the "American" broadcasters say "how the
Fear Of God must be put into these people for the Protection Of The
World". She put it out there as her own opinion, and indeed it was; why
else the "meanwhile ignoring..." continuation of the paragraph? Strictly
opinion with no mincing of words or emotions. After reading it again, I
still consider it a flippant and irresponsible post to make that
insinuates a "got what we deserve" or "It's about time..." attitude.

Read her opening paragraph again. You can find it at the top of this
reply. The "it" she's referring to is the Terrorism that Suineko had in
her(?) thread. What the heck does a colon + lower-case p ( :p ) mean
anyway? It's definitely not a smiley face. She knew precisely what she
was saying when she wrote it, and what effect it could have on others.
Why else the opening of the second paragraph (And before somebody has a
heart attack...)? Her thoughtlessness was only heightened by the
reference to "that horrid Independance Day final speech. :/ ". 

Again, what does colon + forward slash ( :/ ) mean anyway? Definitely
NOT a smiley face.
