It's a bit hard to explain, but I see it as "I don't really want to help
you. I just want to help my bank account." I have every intention on paying
someone that performs a duty for me... but I think if they ask for it, it's
rude. :b

If someone rezzes me (or ports for that matter) and doesn't ask for
compensation, I read it as an act of kindness. They didn't help me just to
make money, but because they're nice. So I reward them. (Of course, I'm
highly biased since I don't like people in particular, and I rarely meet
people that should be considered Human...)
