Using 3 plane of time+ guilds on my server to base my response..
Each guild has an average of 4 monks.. 1.5 beastlords.. 1.5 SK's.. 4 palis..
5 rangers.. 4 rogues

This doesnt rate terribly differently to the numbers I saw on Prexus for
several years either.

Not true

Which weapons do you both use?

I use FD in raids, elemental groups and ldons.. which part was it erased
from?

Nope, not very well.

Logs, please.
At the level i play, thats not even close to being true.

A friend just recently servermoved to apply to my guild.. hes not PoTime
geared or anything of the sort. 6k hp unbuffed, BoT weapon.. so hes closer
to you than me in terms of gear, flags and such. (He is an SK)

He solos in Kod'Taz and Yxtta with ease.  Some mobs summon, but most don't.
FD is a good enough get out of jail card for that.. so where exactly has an
SK's soloability been removed?

I think bards come in considerably below paladins for DPS...

Lol. A paladin who thinks and believes that is somebody who will never be
better than abysmal at his class.

Exodus is pretty much an instant cas evac spell.. their port spells are
always desirable. Ae Tl more so, and Natimbi port even more so.

Necro DPS is high, potentially very high indeed.  You know.. these class
descriptions you are posting.. really makes me boggle and wonder about the
sort of people you are grouping and playing with

If you can never look to the GOOD things your class can do.. you will NEVER
be happy or satisfied..
