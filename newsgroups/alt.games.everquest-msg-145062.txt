But a mage putting out 2/3rd the damage that a wizard does
plus his pet putting out 2/3rd the damage a warrior does
plus his DS putting out 1/3rd the damage a warrior does

is 5/3rds the damage output of other classes.  OOM?  Dang,
he is only doing the 2/3rds plus 1/3rd.  OOM Wizard, on
the other hand, is doing Zip.

Most comparisons between classes discount the mage pet,
since until recently pets were anathema in any serious group;
now that they don't break mez, pets are welcome in far
more situations, and tip the balance rather heavily.
