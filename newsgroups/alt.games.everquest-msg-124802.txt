This is someone's final in regards to some of our current day popular
children's stories, one of which, is Red Riding Hood.

One of the things I have noticed, which stemmed from watching a Japanese
Anime, was the telling of the Red Riding Hood story.  At first, I thought
it was a modified version, but apparently, it is the original version of
Red Riding Hood, in which the Wolf eats both the Grandmother or Mother, and
Red Riding Hood.

Now like most of us, I grew up with the nice little story of where Red and
Grandmother gets saved or Red escapes the wolf.  One thing about this
paper, is that the writer notes how the 'popular' version of Red Riding
Hood would actually suggest children may not see the full moral of the
story, or take it to believe that you can be saved even though you
shouldn't trust strangers.

It would also seem, that while people seem to jump up and down about how
realism and violence seems to make people violent and overly aggressive,
perhaps watering down things makes people overly pliant or naive as well.

I am sure a lot of you who are in your 30s to 40s, remember growing up in
the 70s and 80s, some of whom also grew up playing Soldier or Cowboys and
Indians.  Heck, some of you watching GI Joe Cartoons where people fought
and no one really died or looked like they died.  I even remember watching
a lot of the war movies, which weren't that graphic about how war was.
Now, with Saving Private Ryan and some of the Vietnam movies, we get a
glimpse of war not being glorious, but something we shouldn't crave so
badly, nor ignore the purposes behind it.

It is interesting to see that there is some people who have this point of
view, the one countering our current standard of 'watering' down some
things.
