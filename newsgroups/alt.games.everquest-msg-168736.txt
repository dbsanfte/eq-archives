Sadly this inspirational piece of public democracy in action isn't
celebrated as a public holiday.   As a part of the celebrations a
'guy' (an efigy of Guido 'Guy' Fawkes) is placed on a bonfire and
burned.

I remember listening to the radio a number of years ago and they
interviewed the headmaster of the school up in York which Fawkes once
attended asking him if they would have a 'guy' on a bonfire.  The
headmaster came back with the classic reply, "At this school, we don't
burn our Old Boys!".

If there were today such a similar display of public-spiritness in
which the parliament were blown up there would be approximately
fity-six million suspects...
