ES arms take over 9 seconds to cast.
Velious quest bracers (same right click effect) takes about 4 seconds
to cast.

The effect is useless.
By the time you get this (remember where it comes from and it is a
rare load on that dragon), you're gonna have regrowth.  

Hell, I know druids who got their Velious quest BP before their ES BP
(not that they bothered keeping the ES BP).  Right click regrowth of
the grove vs. choloroplast?  No contest.

And the velious BP casts faster than the ES BP.

Pretty much all the ES effects are marginal if not completely useless.
A 10 second invis off the helm?  Right.
Pack wolfform off the bracer.
5 second casting snare off the gloves.
Levitate that *STILL* fucking requires a batwing off the boots.
Skin like *DIAMOND* off the legs which is a rare load on VS (good luck
finding him up for more than 5 mins).

And they all weigh a ton.  The only ES item I still bother with is the
boots and that's because I'm hoping beyond hope that some jackhole at
VI will get it through their stupid head that having batwing
requirements on a item effect that comes off a level 50+ mob in a
keyed dungeon is stupid compared to the same effect off a level 30 mob
that doesn't require reagents.
