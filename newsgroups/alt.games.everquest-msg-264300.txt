I was looking for an update to a UI player window I use [mafoos, 
FWIW=)] and I was wondering...

I use eq watcher occasionally, and notice it has all sorts of 
interesting plug ins, and in EQInterface they have lots of 
interesting goodies like timers and database access windows, how 
difficult would it be to make a small window/interface bit that 
accesses the voice transmission capabilities of say Yahoo or MSN 
that has a little control window like the MP3 player?  I would 
love to voice chat, and have heard all sorts of tales about 
different chat programs, each program has people who love it and 
those who hate it.

Also, is there a good kindhearted person out there who can 
explain to me exactly how to go in and modify an extant player 
window a bit more? there is a player window I like, but the slots 
that they have out are for odd slots, I would like to recustomize 
it for my cleric's specific clicky slots...so all it would take 
is [i guess] "readdressing" some of the little boxes in the 
windows from one item or body slot to a different one...
