    It's a complicated encounter. I'm glad you folks pulled through and won
in the end, though. :-)

    Only people that have been on a raid can appreciate how funny and true
this is. Positioning clerics is like an online version of "Simon Says".

    Which you should avoid like the plague until you get your upgrades from
other, easier planes like Fire. Some rings in Earth are very
straightforward, but some are pure misery. We just spawned the Arbitor and
tested him this weekend, one week after deciding to learn the Earth rings.
It was a full day (2 pm to 11 pm) to get all that done.

    That means there's an issue with the aggro on the MA, not that he
delayed too long calling people in. Unless you think that, had people been
called in earlier, that you could have taken him down before getting
summoned.

    I posted that in our cleric forum when we were learning the encounter,
as "something to expect in the near future". We all got a good laugh out of
it. I especially identify with the cleric shouting "Fuck me!", as that's
something I've said many times as I see a mob slowly get pushed right at the
clerics (who, being in a tight CH cycle, cannot move fast enough). When
you're casting a CH and you're now between the boss and the main tank, you
know what's going to happen when the heal lands. I hate swarm pets.

    Odd that they'd leave right as you're about to succeed. I really have to
wonder what motivates people like that, that they think they can do better
somewhere other than in a tightly-knit guild where they have seniority.

    In my case, I was there for the first RZ kill but I didn't have all my
HoH trials and Mith Marr done yet, so I had to watch the guild go crazy in
the elemental planes while I did nothing. It's tough, but you need to keep
telling yourself that you will get there, the guild won't leave you behind,
and you will share in the bounty ahead. Assuming CiH doesn't stalk you from
plane to plane, trying to KS you.

    The funny thing is this: excepting PoEarthB and Xegony, you now have
access to every mob to which they have access. And because of the lost
seniority from moving to a new guild, the people that left are now at the
bottom of the loot priority list. If I were a greedy so-and-so, that's not
where I'd want to be. Sounds like there's more going on here.

    Aha, so there IS more going on! Well, whatever the problems, I hope you
get through them. Right now there's a general contraction at the top end of
EQ. More and more people are quitting because there's nothing to do, so
top-end guilds are recruiting as never before from anyone that is already
flagged. I hope you don't lose more people to that.
