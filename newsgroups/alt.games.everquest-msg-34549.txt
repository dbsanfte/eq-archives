You claim to like bug fixes but then turn around and yell "nerf! nerf!"
Sorry guy, those are often bug fixes...and when they're not bug fixes,
they're things that had to be done.

> VI rarely hits ETA of bringing servers up .

Huh?  When was the last time they were more than 15 minutes late?  How late
were they?

To be bitching about patch days shows me you're pretty new to the game.  For
the longest time it was a running joke that for an ACCURATE estimate, take
whatever they say and multiply it by 1.5.  A "4-hour patch" means 6, an
8-hour patch means 12.  NOW any time they patch they're usually back up
early.

As for emergency patches, there's about 30 servers, each server at least 20
machines.  That means on patch day they update at least 600 machines.  Yup,
it's true, a lot of the time a server or two will be down longer than
scheduled.   Yup, it's also true that on occasion ALL servers come down for
an emergency patch.

But jesus christ, stop your whining and go clean your house during those
times...it needs it!  If you have kids you're neglecting them by playing
EQ...go pay attention to them.
