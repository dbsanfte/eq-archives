Personally I don't understand why Sony won't let others post on their 
forums who aren't currently subscribed.  I can only assume for damage 
control.

This does nothing except fill their forums with ass-kissers, and the 
truth never gets out.

Like in every thread, the only thing the a-kissers can come up with is, 
"can I have your stuff".  Just shows their true personality in life.

Although I am shocked, that an EQ Producer actually scolded one of the 
ass-kissers for his attitude.  That is a first.
