Easiest stuff to get is player-made jewelry.

2 gold cat's eye bracers - 7 cha - cost about 20pp
2 electrum star ruby rings - 7 cha / 5 dex - cost about 100pp

That's 28 CHA for less than 250pp.

You can also get stuff for the neck and face slots:

1 velium cat's eye necklace - 10 cha - about 350pp
1 platinum cat's eye necklace - 9 cha - about 150pp
1 silver cat's eye necklace - 3cha - about 5pp

1 velium star ruby veil - 10 cha / 10 dex - 450-500pp
1 platinum star ruby veil - 9 cha / 9 dex - 250pp
1 silver star ruby veil - 5 cha / 5 dex - 100pp

Depending on how much cash you have to spend, you can get another 8 to 20
cha.  You should be easily able to get to the magic 105 cha.

And if you buy everything at once, you should be able to get a volume
discount.  All prices approximate, YMMV, etc.
