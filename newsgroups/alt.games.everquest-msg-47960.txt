Ok, now you're just confusing me. (Tough trick, huh?<g>) Yes, ignoring
the primary damage bonus is bad, but I was under the impression that
even if you received *no* damage bonus to the primary, that you still
wanted the fasted weapon in the primary hand. (This based on the idea
that you'll attempt to hit more often with the primary than the
secondary, so you want those attempts coming as rapidly as possible.)
Not true?
