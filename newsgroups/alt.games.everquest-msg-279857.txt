You got it pretty much.

The MA or Main Assist is the person that everybody else in the group
aside from the MA himself and the puller target to assist, such that
everybody focuses on the same target.

Many groups, especially at the lower end don't have a separate MA, the
puller in effect takes both jobs.

As things get more difficult, it sometimes makes sense to have a puller
independent of the person that will decide which mob to beat on first.
Generally that person is the MT (Main Tank) but doesn't have to be.
Often it will be the leader of the group or a member experienced in the
area, that can quickly spot mobs in a pull that must be killed first
(like healers or casters in general).
