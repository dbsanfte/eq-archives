For your level 16 spells go to ANY zone that has critters appropriate for
levels 16-21 (level+5).  After over 2 years of playing my enchanter I've yet
to find a decent pattern of particular research drops.

As someone else pointed out, /auct is an option.  I'd also recommend /join
auction  and try to buy it there.  I wouldn't pay more than 30p for it.

As to vendors, since there's 16-21 zones all over the place, the best thing
you can do is just check every...single...one.  Vendor diving is how I got
most of mine.

Suggestions:
- Make a list of pages you MUST have (research only) and always look for
those on vendors...regardless of what level the spell is.  Other pages are
fine for research practice, but the research-only spells take up enough
vault space as it is!!!
- Screw research.  Buy the Tome of Endless Enchantments, keep it with you at
all times, and when you have a spell that needs made, put the pages in the
Tome and go looking for a nearby high level enchanter and politely ask them
to hit Combine for you.  DO NOT SAY "PLZ." Don't use ANY dewdspeak.  I think
of all classes, probably enchanters are the ones who tolerate people who
sound 12 yrs old the least.
- If you decide not to screw research, put practice points into it instead
of combining purchasable spell pages.
