:o)

Actually I knew that it would drop, I just didn't have much choice.  I had
no idea where I was, no map of Grobb handy because I hadn't expected to need
one.  I figured as dangerous as it was, it probably beat walking around
waiting for invis to drop, and maybe ending up in a worse spot.  Like right
in front of 4 or 5 troll instead of just one.
