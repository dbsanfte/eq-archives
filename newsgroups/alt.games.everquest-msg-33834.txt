How about no... This is a fantasy game, not a alternative world.

But how would this really work?  Would you have to have this "dead"
character in your character select menu, or would he be erased?  Then when
the character takes the dirt nap, can you use his name again?  If you have
to keep him in your character select screen, can you still use him as a
ghost to haunt people?   What about the servers that only allow 1 player?
Will your corpse be lootable by the first passer?  What about the bank
items?  How about the elixer of life that is bound to exist?

Sorry but the graveyard is the only idea that actually seems "cool."
