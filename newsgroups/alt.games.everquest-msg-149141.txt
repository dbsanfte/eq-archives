Lol, you should see the furor the new spell list has
raised over a the Magicians Tower.  The upshot is that
many epic'ed mages are upset with the idea that a 
purchased or dropped pet might be better than their
epic in any single area (that includes necro and BL
pets too).  Essentially they appear to want either
A.  All pet classes to stagnate in terms of pet power
while everyone else gets upgraded, or B.  VI to simply
keep upgrading Epic so anyone with it will still never
have to make the decision of which pet is more suited
for the task at hand.  (that's the way it stands now,
an epic mage will almost NEVER use any other pet - 
removing a huge portion of the strategy of playing
a mage, learning to use various pets strengths in
different situations)
