Healing, and stepping in to kill the monster you think is going to
kill someone else are two very different things.  I always ask before
stepping in to attack.  Being a ranger I have other options.  I can
root or snare it.  I can heal (if they are a low level char).  I can
SOW the person for a gettaway.  But assuming that they are going to
need offensive help is a bad idea.  I personally get 'ganked' time and
again when meleeing something that would kill me in a simple melee.  I
might be trying to get a proc slow off but rooting and backing up to
heal if unsuccessful.  Or I may appear to be running, when Im just
getting some distance to kite, root, or even mem a spell.  People too
often 'help' me when the situation is well under control.

Never assume someone wants you to attack their pull.
