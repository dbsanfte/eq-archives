Nah, that's the group that complains *second* loudest.

The loudest complainers are the people who had *just* discovered
the technique (or acquired the powerful item) and said to
themselves, "wow, this makes the game much more fun to play",
only to have it nerfed within 48 hours.

I've lost count of the number of times that has happened to me...

I sometimes think the developers are watching over my shoulder,
and nerfs are triggered by them saying, "uh oh, Dan's having
too much fun all of a sudden".
