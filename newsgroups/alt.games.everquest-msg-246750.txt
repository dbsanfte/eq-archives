wishing to upgrade sure. wondering whether they actually need to upgrade 
in the first place... much harder to call whether *today* is the day...

Fascinating. Too bad I have no way to get proof of this... can anyone 
else with any top end video card confirm his claim that a large GoD raid 
during a 'burn it down' moment, while you are directly looking at 30 
plus people in your LoS, with all particle and spell effects maxed 
doesn't lag? I know I'm not there yet, but then my system isn't brand 
new anymore.

EQ is not 'most hardcore gamers'...its a wider demographic then the rest 
of the graphics business.

I do. I know many people for whom 200 bucks is not something they can 
easily spare, living month to month paying groceries/rent/insurance and 
paying off the transmission that died on them 2 months ago with their 
'disposable income'.

Must be nice only knowing people of free of financial concerns. :)

Oh... i guess they aren't willing then are they?

But they still play the game. So maybe they are willing after all. They 
could always restrict themselves to quake2...if they didn't want to put 
up with borderline fps.

Given that every system is 'substandard' within a couple months, and 
there is always a game out there that could be run better with hte next 
video card one cannot meet this objective.

Many games are released such that *NO* system on the market can turn 
everything on without notable performance degradation... thus the 
'standard system to run it properly' is still months in the future.

"Not wishing to have substandard system" isn't the issue, inability to 
actually buy a system that is ahead of the curve is. The only question 
is how far behind the curve can you afford to be.

But future proofing with computer hardware is absurd. Period.
The axiom in computer hardware is buy what you need today today. 
Tomorrow you can buy hardware to meet your needs tomorrow for far less.

To highlight an absurd example... A couple years ago I installed a TS 
server with a client, the vendor highly recommended I go with a then 
state of the art  dual xeon 1ghz server, for around 8 grand... to future 
proof us.

Instead I went with a simple P4 1.6  which I determined would easily 
meet our requirements for the first year. The dual xeon would have been 
  faster, but not markedly as we would be adding users gradually.

A year later we upgraded to a p4 3GHz-fsb800 with HT. Its considerably 
faster the dual xeon 1ghz would have been...and I'm still over $5000 ahead.

By the time I blow the 8000 bucks i could have spent to 'future proof 
me'... I'll probably have a 5GHz server... or more.

The ti4200 is still enough for most games today (note that it was 
*never* a top end card). When the true DX9 games actually arrive and you 
find one you want to play that you can't run... that's when to upgrade.

EQ is still running... adequately, by most accounts... on nvidia ti 
series cards. I'd wait a bit yet to upgrade.

EQ is not an FPS for one thing. And if the worst you get is 26fps during 
busy scenes then one is unlikely to be super motivated to drop $200+ on 
a video card... especially since you are probably looking a new 
mobo+cpu+ram too...

I highly doubt there are a lot of people running a ti4200 on a 800FSB or 
later class system.

Oh rubbish my ass. Its the default 99% of the time. Hell... i just 
reinstalled windows xp a couple weeks ago on box 1, and it set my 
refresh to 60.

Unless you've manually gone in and changed it, that is where it will be 
on a *large* number of systems. The average EQ player is not the 
teenage-frag-junkie-computer-tweaker you get in UT2004 its a wider 
demographic appealing to women and adults.... its not just you 
pc-tweaking power-gamer crowd; rest assured that vast numbers of players 
are running it at 60Hz.

hell... I just (*sheepishly*) noticed my very own 2nd box is still on 
60hz... but then I don't 2box UT2004 either... its a 2k3 box used as a 
personal IIS/TS server... the only game on it is EQ.

Hmmm...I would look forward to buying an X800 XT Platinum... or 
whatever... and shunting the 9800 over... but i still don't think eq is 
going to be the game to give me that reason.

I dunno that I agree. In the benchmarks I've seen the X800 is 
*dramatically* better than the 9800 series, considerably more than the 
performance jump typical in a video card generations (reminiscent of the 
tnt2 -> geforce jump). If you *can* wait, I'd still argue there is merit 
waiting until the X800 series falls to your 'buy' price point.

And then there's the whole imminent PCI express deal to consider... do i 
really want to shell out for a even a $200 agp card right now. If your 
going to run the future-proof argument... i think that is where that one 
really runs flat. Its like buying a PCI card just before AGP rolled 
out... Even though pci-x won't likely prove to be that much faster out 
of the gate, just as AGP wasnt that much faster when it arrived...
