Hrm.  I found the problem.  Unfortunately, the file name was right.  But 
both the chardokb and veksar maps from eq-toolbox have what look like the 
wrong kind of carriage return in them.  If you open up the files in 
notepad, everywhere there should be a return, there's a little thingy that 
looks like a box.

So, next solution... anyone know where to get an un-screwed-up file, or a 
clever way of un-screwing it without having to go through and take out 
3,000 little boxes by hand and replace them with returns?  Ah, never mind, 
I've sussed it.  If you open the file in wordpad (not notepad!) and save 
it over itself, it fixes the problem automagically.  Woot! I have mappage 
now. :)
