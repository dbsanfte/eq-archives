Now that someone has actually mentioned it...it is a good idea...however I
didn't like the fact that the original few replies failed to read the part
about me needing to be AFK, and specifically suggested software for use
while at the computer (I've got multiple systems so no need to brows or
check e-mail on the same one).

If there is, then there is something to have task manager do.  Command line
(run batch file) CTRL+ALT+DEL, end task certain program.

Why would you say that?  My guess was based on my asking of how to do
something while away from the computer, and also specifically stated that it
would NOT be possible to do the desired tasks while EQ was running
(minimized or anything.  Even my 3rd paragraph specifically stated (though
used name "DX Windows" as that is a program or name I've heard of before
which is same purpose) that I could NOT run EQ in a windowed format while
doing video capture at the same time.  Then someone fails to read the entire
post & suggests what I specifically stated I would not be able to do (and
even gave reason as to why).  Most of all, as I said, the subject asks
"while AFK", then they respond giving software I said would not work.  Later
another makes a bad attempt at flaming me by also ignoring the "AFK" part
and says, "you can minimize the window to surf other sites or what not".
Finally someone does recognize what I asked, "Actually, I believe he wants
it to disconnect and shut down EQ at some specific time".
    That is what my guessing of them not having read the post (or subject)
was based on.

Yes, 98SE (Second Edition, in effect 98 Service Pack 1) does have task
scheduler.  I was just meaning that I'm not aware of a "end this task"
option, only a "begin this task".
