 I have to agree with Caeli.  SOE is not altogether nerfing soloing but are
making many decisions/changes affirming and better group play in the game.
PoP Planes are all but impossible to fight in without a group. The next
expansion, Lost Dungeons of Norrath, is being made explicity for groups of 5
to 6.  There seems to be less content for the lone wolf explorer or duo or
trio or even quartet anymore.  That being said it is well within SOEs rights
to do whatever the hell they want with the game.  It's a shame they may lose
more of their subscriber base doing so when they could easily accomodate all
types of role players.
