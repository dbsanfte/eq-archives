Graveyards aren't all bad... having to beg another guild to recover your 
corpses after a particularly bad day isn't a terribly great 'feature' of 
any game. Corpses should end up in the graveyard, although maybe not as 
quickly.

> - long duration buffs

People complain about temperance and KEI as destroying the low and mid 
games as they distory the players power level too much.

> - mass group buffs

Nothing wrong with these.

> - high ZEM outdoor zones for easy exp grinds

Lots of people complain about (solo) xp grinds being too easy nowadays.

> - raid exp

How is this relevant? Raids have never been about xp... this is a very 
minor issue.

> - incredible variety of spells to handle difficult situations

New difficult situations requires new spells and abilities. Otherwise 
its not very 'new' and gets old fast.

> - mounts

Hardly unbalancing. Although bards are a little irritated by them... 
just as many wizards and druids were irritated by the pok books.

And mounts as a medding convenience... sure... ok... but their outdoor 
only... only useful in half the game, and not the most interesting half.

> - vastly increased mana regen

There has been no shortage of people complaining about KEI.
There has been no shortage of mages being irate about being reduced to 
modrod summoners at one point.

And I vaguely recall there was some item that was removed from the game, 
except for people who already had one, WAY BACK, that people were being 
passed-over on raids because they didn't have one... I think it was a 
mana regen item actually?? But I was a lowbie back then, don't really 
know... someone else surely does though.

People have always complained about vastly increased mana regen.

Having said that, nobody enjoys sitting in one spot for 50% of their 
time either... so mana regen isn't inherently a bad thing, although it 
does unbalance with respect to pure melees a bit right now.

> - charm slot

Big deal. Whats to complain about?

> - armor pieces with +20 to everyhing, no need to keep or carry resist gear

Mudflation at its best. Personally, however I would like to have seen 
the best armours have critical flaws. Like +40 to half resists -40 to 
the other half... makes gear more situational; which makes more of it 
valuable because there is no 'single best piece'.

> - Call of the Hero

Anywhere it was too useful it got nerfed ;)
