It's my understanding (which may be wrong, not being yurpeen) that people
found out there was an additional shipping charge, tacked on by UPS at the
end (another $20 or so). The current charges reflect the whole charge that
will be there. It has to do with VAT and import charges iirc.
If you have a good friend over on this side of the pond, you could order it,
have it shipped to them, and they could send you the code (since you
obviously already have the software, and just want a second account). Lots
of people did that kind of thing with the SWG beta (which you could
download, but you still had to order a cd to get into).

Ideally, I'd like to see them sell just activation codes for, say, $7-$8
cheaper (I figure stamp it, box it, packaging, including manual, shouldn't
be much more than that. The beta disks for SWG were supposed to be 'at cost'
for disks, storage, simple packaging, etc, and were about $5.50. With this
they have a lower per unit cost due to production scale, but there is more
in a commercial release. $7 is realistic for a production cost for
materials). but for whatever reason I don't think it's ever going to happen.
