Warriors do need help, but I don't think a knight nerf is the answer.  Nor
do I think it should be better aggro control either.  Warrior aggro control
is not as bad a problem is many would believe.  The "warrior aggro problem"
is that knights have been superior tanks for too long, such that there is a
significant amount of players who don't know how to control thier aggro
anymore, or are too lazy to do so. (1)

Warriors need a boost.   They need an "and so much more" thing.   Knights
already have thiers.   Tanking, and so much more.    In the case of
paladins, the "and so much more" is instant aggro control, backup heals, and
backup rezing.   In the case of shadowknights, the "and so much more" is
instant aggro control, feign death pulling, and a bit more DPS.  With
warriors... you just get the tanking.

There needs to be a reason to let the warrior do the tanking.  So you have a
choice between instant aggro control and some other good advantage.   I
don't really have a great suggestion, but knight level aggro control just
doesn't do it for me.  That just makes all the tanks more vanilla.  They're
all the same, just grab one of them at random.   So what else?  A dps boost?
Perhaps... but then you're encroaching upon the ranger and monk territory.
And it still wouldn't get warriors tanking.   Turning them into a semi-dps
class would just move them behind the mob while the knight tanks.

Best I can come up with is to add a few AA's.  (Sony likes fixing things
through AA's.   Give people a bit more reason to exp :P). Drasticly reduce
or even eliminate the tremendous DPS hit a warrior takes when he uses
defensive discipline. (and perhaps speed up the reuse time a bit) Make it so
that /discipline defensive suddenly has a place to be used in an experience
group, not just in a raid situation.  That would give warriors a real and
quantifiable advantage in tanking.  Not some vague "well, my CH will heal
7000 hp on a warrior, but only 6000 on an equivalent knight", but a real
advantage, a 30 percent reduction to thier melee damage taken.   Suddenly
you have a real choice.  Do you want a knight tanking so your casters and
dps melees run no risk of getting aggro?  Or do you want a tank that takes
less melee damage, easing the stress on your healers?

(1) - It is with some amusement that I notice all of these people that love
to complain about the "dumbing down of the game"  will jump all over little
things like newbies getting sense heading, or targeting improvments, or
instanced dungeons, yet the same people turn a blind eye to the real dumbing
down of the game.  The fact that permanent knight aggro holding abilities
have all but removed the need to for the individual to learn anything about
aggro control.  They eliminate boat rides, you're up in arms.   They
eliminate the skill requirement to combat... "best change ever".
