Yes his post was indeed on the mark.  Though I have never played a healer,
being a Bard, I am almost always grouped with one.  I see this crap all the
time.  Never tell your correct mana?  Don't.  Again, that would leave you
nearly defenseless against the tanks "fuzzy math".
"pull" and "hold pulls" should be all you need.  Short, simple commands with
no big words to confuse them.  Also, healer saying "AFK" or "phone" means
"pull a whole mess of 'em!" for some reason.
