I always like it when someone on Usenet pretends they can read
minds. Its always good for a cheap laugh.

True, I don't know some of those things. I do use bind wounds. Some
of my 'toons have used all of the start bandages and bought more
since. As for grouping, I'm not interested. So your fears are
unfounded, groundless, and sound very much like whining.
