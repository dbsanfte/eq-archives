Art keepers makes you highelf right? yes the wasps will be there but
you ned to kill the right kind of wasps for the right kinds of drops
the drones and workers are generally common wasps the drones the most
so, the drops you need are fairly common except the warrior stuff I

When they first introduced these quests on test, I was a ranger, and I
wasted my birthday about 18 hours of it, trying for an ulna bone, in
the end a GM felt sorry for me as Id been trying for a week..
