What they didn't have in mind was Game Theory. Somehow, all of those
great minds working together couldn't come up with the immutable rule
that, in any sufficiently large competitive system, a certain number
of competitors will min-max and it is from those who do min-max that
the most successful competitors will be drawn.

When I played StarCraft online, I got very frustrated with the
zerg/zealot rush. I wanted a more nunced game. I tried to build
defensive. I tried joining "NO RUSH" games. I tried playing
island-based scenarios. Eventually, I quit playing because I find
StarCraft's min-max strategy to be incredibly boring.

If you play to win and don't like what the endgame in EQ requires,
play something else. This is not a long way of saying CIHYS, but
advice that would do everyone reading it some good.
