Oh.. Xp home only supports one processor. XP pro supports 2 or more
cpu.  Great if your running servers and have a motherboard and
software that supports it.. (Everquest done not support, or use
Multi-procs). But.. advange is your os background operations are using
one cpu while EQ has a CPU all by it self. :)
