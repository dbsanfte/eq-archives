Mistmoore is a great place for a high-twenties warrior.  Even if 
you can't get anywhere near the werewolf yet, hunting in the 
Canyon with a full group of 6 (you will NEED a full group of 6 to 
get there) is a barrel of mad fun!  If you don't have a full 
group of 6, you can camp the Graveyard, which has 6 spawns which 
spawn just a bit slowly; I found it ideal for a group of three.  
You get lots of Fine Steel drops there.  I find it camped a lot, 
though.
