Let's see, I say it is irrelevant for the first 24 levels because you
*don't* even have the spell cannibilize, after which it is irrelevant
because you can afford gear to adjust, and you say my point that it is
irrelevant is irrelevant.

I think you have irrelevant on the mind.

You need to show me a link where someone does it. Mine is a statement of
fact: I have never seen or heard or read of a necro going with HP/AC gear
vs. int. This includes vists to places like Casters Realm and AllaKhazam's.
If you think is it so common, put up. I say at best it would be an esoteric
strategy used in rare instances.
