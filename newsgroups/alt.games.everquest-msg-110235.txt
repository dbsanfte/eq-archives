As Verant refuse to give us server numbers then we cannot really tell and
ATM I'd agree that we are not at that stage but I see it coming and I can
see people tiring of the whole genre.

I'd imagine they will take many of their own "parent" game's players who
will view their current game as out of date and I imagine it will lose
plenty who will either drop from MMORPG's altogether (read a few of the
comments in this NG and on Allakhazams) or, as they feel let down by
manufacturer (either Verant or Turbine) will go elsewhere for their MMORPG
experience.

All speculation, I stand by mine tho' I still think, come christmas, next
year, the total player base will be a smaller one than now.
