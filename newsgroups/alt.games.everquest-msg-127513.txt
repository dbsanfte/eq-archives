LOL you guys crack me up, you know that I'm selling the game, not the acct,
and like my auction says, acct is available upon request, so if you don't
want it you don't have to get it, you can start your own.  oh yeah lol, you
actually read the user agreement? I played the game for almost 2 years and
never read it once.  And i'm sure you obey every law there is too...

woo hoo were on a roll, keep the flamin flames commin!
