Spell Casting Mastery saves you mana with more successful specialization 
checks, Spell Casting Subtlety saves the healers mana by reducing your 
aggro.

Mental Clarity 3, Gather Mana and Hastened Gathering help recover from 
wipes and is handy for those times when someone just plain overpulled and 
you're going OOM faster than the mobs are going down.

Dire Charm will add some safe DPS to your groups.  Animation Empathy is 
nice along those same lines, especially if you're going somewhere with no 
DCable mobs.

Suspend Minion of you want to have an animation in HoT or anywhere else 
that pet aggro is a real problem.

Total Domination if you like to charm mobs outside of DC.

Eldritch Rune is handy for saving your ass when the tank just can't peel 
that mob off you and you need a few more seconds.

That basically takes care of your useful enchanter abilities.  Next you'd 
want to do defensive abilities:

ND3 will give you a few more HPs for not that much AA (usually easier 
than upgrading gear with the same # of HP).
CA3 will help with taking less damage, though it doesn't get really 
meaningful until Lightning Reflexes from what I hear.

And the party tricks:

Spell Casting Fury *is* somewhat handy for XP groups, with your 64 nuke 
criting for 2200.

Permanent Illusion (no longer do you have to cast scaled wolf every time 
you zone!) and Project Illusion (who doesn't love a gnomish death army?)

Jewelcraft Mastery so I can bug you to do combines for me!

On top of all of this I'd highly recommend getting 65.  Even if you have 
no way of getting your spells for 65.  Why?  A few reasons: 1) easier to 
get pickup groups and therefore more AA faster; 2) fewer resists from 
mobs in places like BoT and HoH where it's very easy to grind AA very 
quickly; 3) it's fairly easy to pick up your 63 and 64 spells and you get 
some nice spells in there (NDT, best mez, best dot, best nuke, best 
shielding, best charm).

This is all from playing a 65 enchanter for a while and having talked to 
other enchanters I play with on what they did.
