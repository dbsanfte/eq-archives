The one problem with the Thurgadin gate potion is it's lore, so you
can only have one ready.
The alchemy based port potions lead you to everfrost, innothule swamp
(bad spot there), freerot and field of bone.  All these zones have PoK
books now, so are convinient for further travel. But - the port
potions cost 170 pp in ingredients (from merchant, so no way to reduce
that).  And they have a very high trivial, so few shaman (unless they
have purchased the special AA for alchemy) will be able to make a 10
charge for under 2000 pp. On the other hand, that's still cheap
compared to trying to get a cleric to come and rez you somewhere way
out of the way, because you went LD on a raid and tried to "walk" out
of somwhere tricky.
