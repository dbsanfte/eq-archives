My 1hdeds are 10/21 and 10/22 my 2hder is 34/46
I drop mobs much faster with the 2hder but,
If I am trying to hold aggro I'll use Dual Wield as it's too easy to lose it
with the 2 hnder, unless of course it goes on a proc spree (10 in a fight is
the record and it's been equalled on a  few occasions) then it's all too
easy to steal aggro when you don't actually want it :ï¿½)

Depends on the weapons, a pair of langseax will likely hold aggro over
someone wielding an executioners axe but far less likly over someone
wielding a Mithril 2 handed sword.
