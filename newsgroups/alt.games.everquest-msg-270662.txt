I think that the patch notes for the next patch mention a lot more solo
quests. I hope that this aspect is improved because it does affect me a
lot.  Whilst I like grouping, sometimes I don't want to or only have an
hour or two to play so I don't want to waste the time looking.  I also
like to solo whilst waiting for a group - I won't just sit around until
I get a group.

I can kill ^ and ^^ mobs solo - but they MUST be green and even then I
sometimes have to run away.  In my experience you seem to get more exps
for killing a green^^ mob than you do for a yellow with no arrows.  You
get the message that you get bonus experience for defeating the
encounter after killing group mobs - maybe that's it.

I'm not that bothered but I would have rather been able to do something
like employ an NPC, for a small margin, to do the selling for me.  Any
form of offline selling solution would be better than the current way
it works.

Personally, I can't see how a forum could annoy someone so much that it
spoils the game.  Just find a different forum or don't bother with them
at all.

I think that the map arrow is coming in the next patch.  I'm surprised
at how annoying having no arrow is - it bugs me too.
