/assist doesn't always work.....all it takes is for a two-boxer to
miss the fact that everyone's been yelling "inch-up" because he's
two-boxing for the cleric he's assisting to be out of range, and then
he's screwed.  It happens more than people would like to admit.

But what if the message is delayed?  What if someone zones mentally? 
I still have to watch the rotation messages carefully to skip the
person before me if he's woolgathering.  Gotta stay flexible....

Well, I'm not a 2-boxer, so there you go...*lol*  But in any case, as
above, it doesn't always work.  Again, gotta stay flexible, which is
hard when you're 2-boxing....

Not so much tough as something that requries the proper timing. 
Timing is, in my experience, what being a cleric is all about.

In my guild, any cleric dropping MGB EE is not in the rotation, so
it's ok for a 2-boxer to do it if he can pay attention to it - but
then that person's not in the rotation, so he's not taking the chance
that he'll mess it up - tacit admission that a 2-boxed cleric is not
as efficient.

I really do like that encounter.....keeps everyone on their toes.  We
just did it again last night, and squashed him like a bug.  The
clerics (no two-boxers in rotation at the time) got many
congratulations for not letting even one tank drop.

If the delay is 18 or less (and we rarely if ever do mobs that can be
handled with longer pauses) then this is kind of a non-issue; the
pause has never once been long enough to stop me from ducking,
switching tanks, and recasting.  The issue of human error does still
exist,  yes, but in my experience, again having done it both ways,
there are fewer mistakes with the pause command, which in the end is
better for everyone.

Maybe my guild is better than average on this - there's no one in the
guild who thinks that a 2-boxed cleric is better than a single boxer. 
They know that the best clerics are the ones who have patience,
attention to detail, and are not easily distracted.  It takes timing
that many people in the game lack.  It is a class that drives people
to quit faster than any other on my server, not because peoople get
bored with it, but because the stress factor of being responsible for
the life and deaths of the raiding party becomes too much for some
people to bear.  My guild therefore cherishes the cleric who continues
to play and well.  I will admit that it also helps that most of my
guild members have attempted to play a cleric at least once and found
it challenging because of the needed patience and timing.  Never will
my guild prize a 2-boxer over a single-box - they are too aware of
what is required to be a truly good cleric.

My guild is flexible about healing groups; however, what I meant was
that my group is considered primarily my responsibility, and as a
cleric who is often grouped with enchanters, I can tell you that it is
no mean task, nor a responsibility that I would shirk easily.  We keep
the MT, RT if necessary, and MA up as you mention above, free-for-all;
however, that just argues my point, because I have to stay flexible
enough to manage those three tanks AND my group, which always has at
least one paper doll (read: robe-wearing caster with heavy
aggro-gaining) in it.

If your guild does not recognize the value of a single-box cleric over
a two-boxed one, I am sorry.  That to me would be an intolerable
situtation - a guild that did not recognize my ability.  :(  The
two-boxers in your guild are not truly successful clerics, because
they can only do one thing - a cheal rotation.  There is much more to
being a cleric than that.
