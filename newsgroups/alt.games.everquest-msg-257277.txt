At the time I was playing, and the level I was playing (65 but not in an
elementals and up guild), the DPS on the available one handed weapons was
far lower than that on available two-handers.  Then toss in the riposte
like you mention.  All the "smart" rangers were getting their hands on
WMBS, Windblade, or GSot4W. I recall that a bunch of rangers said that
starting in Time, this corrected itself, and hopefully in GoD it is so as
well.
