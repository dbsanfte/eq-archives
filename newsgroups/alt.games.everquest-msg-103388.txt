Yes.  Although being a FPS player myself, it is somewhat disorienting when
you are trying to get the darn thing to look right, especially if you back
up against walls or looking around corners.  The Dungeons will provide a
bit of a problem, and in this game... There is no way your friend will be
able to play with the motion sickness issue, since the Chase cam will still
make it difficult, and using the fixed position 3rd cameras will provide
visual problems unlike Diablo, where it conviently drops or transparents
the blocking wall of the room you are in for visibility.  In EQ, the camera
zooms in as it runs out of room, so it is not like Diablo.  I wouldn't
recommend her playing Everquest, mostly because she will need to use First
Person or Chase cam most of the time, and the potential of getting motion
sickness will occur for her.
