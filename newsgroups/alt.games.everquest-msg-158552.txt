Exactly.
I have kept people alive with the heals though, and it does save cleric mana
sometimes. In fact, I have been the cleric as a necro... and it's yet
another challenging role necros can do. It's easier to keep your int caster
partner healed than a true tank, but I have kept a poisoned ranger alive
before. (hunting EK spiders in early 20s)

"Please do not waste your mana. Only heal me if my health is below 60% or
the mob  is trying to eat me."
"Why, yes, I'd love a regen, please."

Repeat ad nauseum.
