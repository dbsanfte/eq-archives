Refusing to rez a fallen moron^H^H^H^H^Hcomrade is just reducing yourself
to their level. I refuse to stoop so low.

Fundamentally it's a moral and ethical judgement. If you decide that
*not* rezzing is justified, it's your decision... but don't expect those
who believe you *are* obligated to rez to respect you, and from what
I've seen in this thread the "obligated to rez" crowd is more numerous
than the "stuff the jerk" crowd.

In other words, you will probably be annoying a bunch of people. You may
think the annoyance is unjustified, but they have just as much right to
make a moral judgement as you do.
