I know you've all seen this question asked in one form or another, but
I have to ask it.

I am going to start an enchanter character and was wondering if anyone
would know of any enchanter specific sites.  I've checked Caster's
Realm and will do more reading there, but I am looking for something
similar to www.eqdruids.com for enchanters.  = )

Any help would be appreciated.
