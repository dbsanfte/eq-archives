Uh-oh...I sense a "should have quit while you were ahead" situation
coming up...

Yup...should have stopped while you were ahead. :-)  The First Amendment
goes well beyond restricting just Congress.  It also restricts the rest
of the Federal government, and State and Local governments, due to the
14th Amendment.  It doesn't go so far as to reach Verant's message
board, of course, so the first poster is still an idiot.

(The 14th does this to the States via the part about "privileges and
immunities".  Over the years, the Supreme Court has basically decided
that those "privileges and immunities" are basically most of the rights
covered in the Bill of Rights).
