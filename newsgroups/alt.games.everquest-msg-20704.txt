It is important to mention that, for a warrior, Kick caps at 149, while
bash caps at 220 or so, pre-50.
So all his kicks at level 48 were done with a max kick skill of 149,
while all the bashes at level 45, were done with a bash skill of 220
(hmm... I think its 220, might just be 200, either way, the point is
the same) Assuming he'd maxed these skills out for his level.

Post-50, both of these numbers increase, but pre-50, there is quite a
variation in their level cap.
