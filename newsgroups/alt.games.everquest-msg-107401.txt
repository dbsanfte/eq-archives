I always carry at least one stack of peridots (I'm a 52 Paladin), it
just seems like the thing to do.  They're handy for encouraging a
cleric in a pickup group to use their symbols where appropriate, and
they seem to be quite welcome as payment for high level rez. :)  Also,
whether or not I'm the MT, I'd just as soon the Cleric did not symbol
anybody other than the MT (and the Enchanter), even when I've given
peridots, unless we've got a high mana to mob ratio (i.e. casters are
often FM) or I've got to do a lot of off-tanking.  I don't know what
the mana cost of the higher symbols is, but pinzarn (the best I've got)
costs half as much as CHeal, better to keep that mana to heal the MT.

I rarely cast my own symbol (Pinzarn, 200mana + Jasper) anymore,
except that in a Clericless group I'll symbol the Enchanter if we have
one and the Druid if she's primary healer.  The extra hp from the
symbol don't seem to have much value without CHeal except for buying
time to rescue melee challenged (low hp/ac + hi agro) groupmates, and
it's a high mana cost buff.  I don't even symbol myself solo anymore,
finally figured out that it's just a waste of mana when solo.
