I'll be politically correct and reply down here, ...
anyway...................

I have a Radeon 8500, AMD Athlon 1700+ cpu on a Soyo K7V Dragon Plus MB, and
512 RAM - I don't use the onboard sound it stinks, but the onboard nic is
great so far - Audigy sound to replace crappy sound with the MB (never buy
integrated stuff normally)

I think it really all goes together - they are all important, the vid card
being a 64mg card or above is really a must to have good low or latency free
gaming.  The RAM is extra important obviously...processor is still
important, of the three the vid card would be top of the list with the RAM
tying it for importance.

I have no latency issues at all with this set up, unless the internet at
large, is experiencing problems and then there is nothing I can do to change
it except log and play a game that is not net bound.
