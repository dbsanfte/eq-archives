Velium with Fire Emeralds in the 11 slot is 7 DS, which means 5 pieces 
caps it out, leaving 3 for other types, or for a real bracer from the 
Defiant set with its focus and other stats, or other real jewelry or 
mask.   I went with two HP regen and one Mana regen.... and then I 
tanked mobs from 44 to 53.   With a skinspike VI potion (best you can 
make without farming ingrediants, good for 35 DS) and my Feedback buff, 
I was at 81 DS.

In Timorous Deep, I found some swabbies (level 48) and pirates (49) 
which hit reasonably lightly.  At first, I just kept them slowed, with 
my animation on their back and the merc healer keeping me alive.   When 
they ran, I rooted them, because the DS was far and away the bigger part 
of my DPS.

Later, I started charming, the ones with rapiers have Backstab and would 
hit for upwards of 430 damage on occasion, and when they broke charm, 
they were only hitting me from the front, relatively wimps.  The 
importance of the DS dropped substantially, but was probably still half 
my DPS... more when I started pulling two or three mobs at a time.

At higher levels, this trick will stop working, as I won't be able to 
take the beat down... also my DS won't keep getting bigger, the potions 
are limited by my being unwilling to farm ingredients, the worn DS is 
capped, and I don't have a bigger cast DS or bard DS or anything like 
that.  I don't plan to make the Palladium DS set, I'll just bank the 
Velium DS set for use when farming low end mobs.
