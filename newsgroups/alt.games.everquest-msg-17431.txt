I found this in alt.binaries.e-book and thought I would share it.



The USENET Guide to Power Troll Posting

1.   Conspiracies abound:

If everyone's against you, the reason can't *possibly* be that you're a
fuckhead.  There's obviously a conspiracy against you, and you will be
doing the entire net a favor by exposing it.  Be sure to mention the
CIA, FBI Oliver North and the Army as co-conspiritors.

2. Lawsuit threats:

This is the reverse of Rule #1.
Threatening a lawsuit is always considered to be in good form.

"By saying that I've posted to the wrong group, Charlie has libeled me,
slandered me, and sodomized me.  See you in court, Charlie."

3. Force them to document their claims:

Even if Jane Jones states outright that she has menstrual cramps, you
should demand documentation.  If Newsweek hasn't written an article on
Jane's cramps, then Jane's obviously lying.

4. Use foreign phrases:

French is good, but Latin is the lingua franca of USENET.
You should use the words "ad hominem" at least three times per article.
Other favorite Latin phrases are "ad nauseam", "vini, vidi, vici", "E
Pluribus Unum" and "fetuccini alfredo".

5. Tell 'em how smart you are:

Why use intelligent arguments to convince them you're smart when all you
have to do is tell them? State that you're a member of Mensa or Mega or
Dorks of America. Tell them the scores you received on every exam since
high school.  "I got an 800 on my SATs, LSATs, GREs, MCATs, and I can
also spell the word 'premeiotic' ".

6. Be an armchair psychologist:

You're a smart person.  You've heard of Freud.
You took a psychology course in college.  Clearly, you're qualified to
psychoanalyze your opponent.  "Polly Purebread, by using the word
'zucchini' in her posting, shows she has a bad case of penis envy."

7. Accuse your opponent of censorship.

It is your right as an American citizen to post whatever the hell you
want to the net (as guaranteed by the 37th Amendment, I think).  Anyone
who tries to limit your cross-posting or move a flame war to email is
either a Communist, a fascist, or both.

8. Doubt their existence:

You've never actually seen your opponent,  have you?
And since you're the center of the universe, you should have seen them
by now, shouldn't you?  Therefore, THEY DON'T EXIST!
Call 'em an AI project, to really piss them off.

9. Laugh at whatever they write.

A good "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" should intimidate just about
anyone.

10. When in doubt, insult:

If you forget the other rules, remember this one.
At some point during your wonderful career on USENET you will
undoubtedly end up in a flame war with someone who is better than you.
This person will expose your lies, tear apart your arguments, make you
look generally like a bozo.
At this point, there's only one thing to do:

Insult the dirtbag!!!

"Oh yeah? Well, you do strange things with vegetables."

11. And, if all else fails, remember that you can always fall back on
the favorite defense of Soc.women:

 "Who cares what YOU think -- this is Soc.WOMEN!".

Add "DAMMIT!" for effect.

12. Be sure to have a cute signature that proclaims that you hate one or
more  of the regulars:

No one will respect you unless it's made clear that you hate them.

13.  Call'em a "Pman" if you can't think of anything.

Tell the linguists to stuff it -- YOU know a diminutive when you see it.

14. Make things up about your opponent:

It's important to make your lies sound true.
Preface your argument with the word "clearly."

"Clearly, Fred Flooney is a liar, and a dirtball to boot."

15. Cross-post your article:

Everyone on the net is just waiting for the next literary masterpiece to
leave your terminal.  From rec.arts.wobegon to alt.gourmand, they're all
holding their breaths until your next flame.
Therefore, post everywhere.

16. Use the smiley to your advantage.

You can call anyone just about anything as long as you include the
smiley.  On really nasty attacks add "No flames, please".
When they bitch, call them an ass for not being able to recognize
sarcasm when they see it.

17. Threaten to destroy ABEB if your opponent refuses to give up.

This at least gives you an appearance of power, even if nobody on
the net gives a damn about what goes on in ABEB.

18. Should you post something exceedingly stupid and later regret it,
don't worry.  You needn't cancel the article.

That only shows what a wimp you really are.

Deny that you ever sent it.

"It must be a forgery!"  (Yea, that's the ticket, it's a forgery!)
"Someone broke into my account and sent it!"
 "It's that damn backbone cabal out to get me!"

Take your pick, they've all been used before.

19. A really cheap shot is to call your opponent a "fascist".

By itself, it really does nothing.
But, when used often, and in enough articles, it can make you a
net-legend.

21. Obfuscation is the key

Always edit your subject line when following up so that no-one knows
what the fuck you're responding to, or why.
This drives 'em wild.

Be sure to follow up to as many articles as possible, even if you have
nothing to say.  The important thing is to get "exposure" so that you
can be called a "regular" in your pet newsgroup.

22. You don't own this group!

Since you're obviously a networking / computer genius
(this would explain your usage of Outlook Express to access Usenet)
Your opinion means more than anyone else's.

Be sure to proclaim "Who voted you xxx of this group?!?"

"Is this group moderated - nope, I didn't think so!"
or, that old classic,

 "Usenet is Anarchy!"

to justify your pointless, off-topic flames and general mayhem on
Usenet. After all, if it were against the rules, you wouldn't be able to
post it in the first place, right?

So it must be okay!

Always change the nym of the person you're responding to when following
up; make sure it's something derogatory for full effect.

Dump a hundred lines of previous posts in every article.

Make sure you *NEVER* contribute anything useful to the groups, as that
would defeat the entire purpose of your meaningless existence.
