Look in the western arm of the Nexus.  There used to be nothing
there but two guys working on a rockslide, now there's a pedestal
with a book on it.  Click on that to zap to the Plane of Knowledge.
You'll be able to see the pedestal now, even though your PoP
expansion hasn't been installed yet, but of course it won't
take you anywhere yet.

Once in PoK, you'll be by a stone marker with the word "Nexus"
on it -- that'll zap you back.  Scattered around the perimeter
of the PoK are other stone markers with various city names
on them.  They'll zap you to the named city.  Each of those
cities now has a book-on-a-pedestal which will return you
to the PoK as well.

Also in PoK is a stone marker with the name "Plane of Tranquility"
on it.  This Plane has links to the other planes.
