Hey guess what!  You pay just as much as I do, and I get more out of it than
you, who's the sucker?

Im a power gamer, I can sit and play for 12 hours if i need and chose to.
If I need something from a camp, I sit there, stfu, and camp it.  I don't
expect everything handed to me on a silver platter and bitch and whine like
some noob ass drood.

Oh and FYI, I have a fulltime job.  I have a r/l partner.  I go on vacation
5-10 times a year (abroad).  I socialise with friends, go to bars, soccer
games, shopping, the usual stuff.

From some moronic druid playing the game in easy mode, and expecting to just
GET what he wants NOW?

And put up or shut up is talking about the camp, you either do it, or stfu
about the item.

Im sorry you sympathise with pathetic noob druids who expect everything done
for them.  Whats your main again?
