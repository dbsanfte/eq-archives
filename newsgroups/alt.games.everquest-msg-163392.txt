I got a couple different custom UIs, opened the files (and the ones in
the default folder) in a text editor, and looked at them. Pretty much
the same way I learned to make winamp skins.
Note: being able to rewrite UI files to suit my wants is not the same
as being able to write one from scratch, but I don't need to do that.
