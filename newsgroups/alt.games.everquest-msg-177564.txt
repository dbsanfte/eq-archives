That would protect the cleric, but it does little to help the tanks 
regain aggro if they have difficulty making contact with a moving mob. 
The result would likely be little different after 18 seconds if the 
cleric insisted on running around.

If you can make it to the zone in 18 seconds or so, more power to ya 
though.
