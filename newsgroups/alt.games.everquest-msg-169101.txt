Before I even read any of the other responses, let me fire one off since
this is pretty easy. In the majority of the planes, that group you just
described is going to get smoked like a salmon in under a minute. Fear
and Hate are out of the question. Without a lot of outside help, not
only would you be slaughtered like sheep, but you'd likely lose the
corpses.

Air Island one is non-aggro, so you could look around. You *might* even
be able to kill some of the lower level fairies there, but not for much
purpose. You could check out that quest hall and do some skydiving,
though. That's pretty cool.

Of the ones "not on rotation", first off you'll never get to Mischief.
You won't even get close. You'd have to run all the way through the
North Wing of Temple of Veeshan to get there. Not going to happen.

That leaves Growth. Yes, if you have any Tunare worshippers with you
that ever hope to see their epic, or a number of other quests, they'll
be fucked. Permanently. Tunare faction (the one for the denizens of the
plane itself and the ubahbitch goddess) is unfixable, and you can go
from indifferent to completely KOS up there in about four kills. The
faction hits are gigantic. You will also go immediately KOS to all the
elves around the GFay area, but that's fixable if  you want to bother.

I *think* that you could kill some of the easy stuff at the wall near
zone in with that group. We take a single group there regularly to farm
cash, (the cash drops there are insane... best in the game bar none IMO)
but everyone is pretty well higher level than you. However, it might be
doable if you really want to try it and don't care about the faction
issues. Start at the wall to the west of where you zone in, and after
that area's clear, move to the edge of the lake. Don't cross the river.
Everything on the other side will swarm you and take your lunch money
and make you cry.
