	Been there done that k thx.  (I pulled the cycle for the first time at
level 44, which I was told was too low.  This was just before Velious went
live, and I didn't even have planar gear.  I dinged 45 doing it and got a
regen tunic.  I imagine it would be easier nowadays with the much better
equipment available.)

	Because they can.  If Tracking was not available, Seb keys would still be
earned.  If I could spend five months on public Hate raids for Earthcaller,
people could spend a few hours getting Seb keys.
