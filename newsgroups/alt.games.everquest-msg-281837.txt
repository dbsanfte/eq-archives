Cool news on Time.  My saturday raid group got piggybacked into time
a couple of months back and our crew took down everything up to
Cazic last sunday.  As far as backflagging goes, we finally won
Coirnav about 3 weeks ago, talk about a totally ugly fight and
just have TRC left for getting fully flagged.

I think your guild should try some of the GoD events.  Take a horde
in and smack down Rondo and/or push folks thru the mountain trails to
get Kod Taz access.  Once you have about 26 or so for that try the
Ikkiz trials, they are actually kinda fun.  Brutal DPS on the mobs
but low HP.   There is some really nice loot there but you *will*
get sick of feeding Darkglint blades to everyone and their sister's
brother's ranger twink and necro pets.

Outside of that, has your crew tried the OoW raid critters?  Rhorious
etc?  Some good stuff to be had from those critters and the OoW spell
rune drops also.
