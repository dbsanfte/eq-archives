    And that's why the original poster is correct, Dan. Remember how EQ has
some silly coding such that if you'd get "too little" share of the XP for a
kill, you get no XP? That coding hits the light blues, too. It's apparently
most noticeable at the lowest levels, where you just won't get XP off a
light blue.
