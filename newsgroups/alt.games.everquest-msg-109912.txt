  Boats add a bit of atmosphere, but let's face it... they aren't that
great.  They've been in the game since inception and they STILL suffer
pretty serious bugs a lot of the time... people getting attacked on them and
having the corpse delivered to the zone line or under the world, going LD
and getting dumped in the middle of an unfamiliar ocean, or boats that
simply don't GO.  Twice in the past month I've been "shoved off" the Bloated
Belly for apparently no reason and have had to wait for it to arrive again.
I did enjoy my first few boat rides with my first character, but since then
they've been nothing but a source of delay, boredom and frustration.

  Plus, waiting for them is a pain, or waiting for someone to arrive on one.
The ride doesn't bother me so much because at least then I know I'm going
somewhere.  But I really hate waiting at a dock for for 10-20 minutes for a
boat to arrive... especially for trips like the Oasis to Overthere or North
Ro to Iceclad... you have to wait on TWO boats, yuck.

  Ways to improve them?  Verant seems to be trying (adding more boats,
adding announcements).  Gambling facilities would be fine, but you just know
that they would make the boats even BUGGIER.. not to mention the fact that
it would require the developement of a whole new gambling "system".

  I like the idea for boat merchants, but I would just prefer the ability to
swim between ocean zones, honestly.  Yeah, maybe it doesn't do a lot for
realism or immersiveness for a character to be able to swim from Faydwer to
Antonica, but then again, neither do boats that have no visible steering
mechanism or crew.  But I'm sure that adding these things would make the
boats even more complicated, and thus buggier.

  I would like to see the boats remain, but I'd like to see them fixed, and
I'd like to see them go a bit faster.  I can outswim a lot of boats, that
just isn't right.  These things should speed across the oceans, and if they
can get rid of the way boats pause for a few minutes after zoning in, that
would be nice too.
