Ahh, I didn't mean the hotkey bank, I meant the macro bank (Alt M) I think.
This is where I have all my /discs, macros for pulling ..ie /gsay I have
incoming %t,
/friends, /w guild all etc. You get 9 sets of buttons for custom macros. I
have this bank right beside
my hotkey bank.
This allows me a whole bunch more buttons to click as well as the hotkeys.
Yes, I have to use the mouse but I'm used to it :)

Even better, a UI that duplicates the hotkey bank, or just gives me a few
more options than 10 hotkeys
so I don't have to change pages.

Thanks again
