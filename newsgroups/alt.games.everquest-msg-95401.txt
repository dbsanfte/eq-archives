Mons is tough because you can get a lot of adds quickly, but just
be careful and keep a sharp eye. Keep the Tboots up and fresh.

I hunt in a couple spots. South East corner, Near zone to the Grey,
and along the west side is a little box canyon to pull to that has
relatively few wandering mobs.

DO NOT hunt at the zone to Marus Seru. People will train there
and things can agro through the tunnel wall. Not safe here at all.
Find a spot on the zone edge to pull to.

Stonegrabbers are way underconned here. They are pushovers
everywhere except here and the Grey. They hit hard, VERY hard.
Kill them fast, or avoid them and get the hoppers and bugs. If you
get 2 or more think about running, heh.

Some Spire Spirits can see invis, nothing else in the zone does.
Pathing in the Spire is horrendously bad, extremely bad, awfully bad.
Plus things agro through the wall easily.
Avoid it like the plague unless you have a strong group and experienced
players. I tried 3 times to find a good pull spot to hunt the spire, never found one
but I never quite made it up to the top solo or with a small group. No one else ever
hunts the spire twice, I bet it will be the most deserted 'camp' on the moon. Bad pathing
combined with see invis spell casters, *shudder*.

The thought Leech cave is also nice but hard to pull just one at
a time, trivially easy if you have a FD puller though. Go there if you have a
decent group. Leeches are easy kills compared to the grabbers. They have pretty
high magic resistance but go down easy to melee. Hard to root, snare and mez
because of this. But their other resistances seemed normal. They are immune to fear.
