Its more targeted at players who dont like to trade skill or have them all
maxed. and have PP but nothing to spend it on, (or just like gambiling)
there are lots of people who have boat loads of plat dont like trade skills
and dont like to make alts. someone was once offering 1.5 Million PP (yes
million)for holgresh beads on tholuxe. and one of the few people who still
has that item wouldnt sell it because he had no use for the plat either
