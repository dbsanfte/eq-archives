But they are a stationary object and once loaded to the client it doesn't
have to re send that data unless the corpse(s) are moved. Having 50 corpses
in a busy zone is not the same as having 50 extra players in a busy zone,
the effect on the system is negligible in comparison. It does lag others due
to your system having to draw all these corpses which was the reason for the
/hidecorpse command.
