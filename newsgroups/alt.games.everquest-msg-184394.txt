But how did you know that the guy in Geoff's story wasn't the
situation I described?

And besides, what on earth is "not twinking much over their level"? 
To some people, that may very well be a pair of centis and a barbed
ringmail tunic at 12.  I do know that if your level 12 has the old
midlevel quest armor, at least on my server, that's pretty mediocre. 
That still goes well over the little bits of stuff I usually hand out
to "untwinked newbies".
