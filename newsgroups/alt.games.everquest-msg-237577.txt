Right, and it's worth noting that the two are not entirely dependent on 
each other's timers. VS spawns on a 3 day cycle, regarless. (Our guild 
camped that bastard for seemingly ages back in the day when I was 
getting my wizard epic.) Once he's killed, he seems to reset the VSR 
spawn clock which will start one day later. But his spawning can blow 
that timer again if they show up at the same time.

He drops some decent loot for how old that content is. I'm still wearing 
a pair of gloves I got off of him at level 65 and even stuck an augment 
on them. Not easy to find 20 INT in the hand slot (or at least it didn't 
used to be) and I think they have some decent resists too.
