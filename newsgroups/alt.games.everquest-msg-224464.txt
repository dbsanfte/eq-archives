damn straight. a group can set its own challenge... you've got six level 
35s? Raid mistmoore, take out Xicotl and his friends...

If you're sitting at the zone line camping in the overthere and your 
finding it dull... that's your own damn fault.

This unfortunately isn't true. The OP is correct, the fastest most 
efficient levelling comes from drop-dead-dull easy camping strategies. 
You won't have a 'night worth remembering' but you'll get more xp/aa's 
that way then any other (even LDoN adventures). Its a flaw of EQ if you 
ask me...
