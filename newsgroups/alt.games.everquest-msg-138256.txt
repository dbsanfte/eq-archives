Granted. You can find certain niche examples where many classes can do
things you wouldn't expect them to do. This in no way is the same thing
as James making a flat statement that "warriors are fairly good
soloers". If I looked long and hard, I could probably find one type of
mob that I could get single pulls on with my 55 warrior and not use 1/2
my HP up. (maybe). But that's just a rare niche exception. For most
places you'd want to hunt, warriors in normal gear don't solo. Period.
If the mob regularly takes you down to 35% of your health or below, and
you can only bandage to 50%, you're going to be able to read War and
Peace in the downtime before you make a level solo.  And it's extremely
rare that you're going to find a solid blue, good xp giving mob that
can't take a normally equipped warrior down that far in one fight a fair
portion of the time. (And kick his ass for him occasionally when the RNG
decides it's "Time to die, Jakugg")

James gave us two examples. His mid fourties warrior in Dawnshroud
wearing what, for lack of a better term, we shall call "crappy gear",
(though mine's a bit better now, it was pretty much the same at his
level) who must be soloing one of these niche mobs.  The second example
he pointed to was a warlord soloing in FG. (I'm assuming warlord, since
100 AA points was mentioned) and regardless of uberguild claims to the
contrary, he's wearing a stack of gear that you will *NOT* fucking find
on more than one in a hundred warriors if you just wander around
randomly inspecting people.

Yeah. Give me that gear and I'll go solo in FG too.  Hell, give me a
manastone and a manarobe, epic and a thousand +Mana worth of other
things and my wizard will go solo all day just like ...

Oh wait. I do that anyway. Bad example. Well, I'd solo a LOT faster. Put
it that way.

Bottom line: taking the two examples cited (lower level/gear warrior
fighting what must be a fairly unique niche mob, and a sixty in ubergear
with a bunch of AA skills fighting in FG) and trying to extrapolate from
that and make a flat statement that "warriors are fairly good soloers"
is simply not viable.
