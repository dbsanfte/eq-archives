So, according to that article, no one on the newest servers will ever
have a 10-slot 'Deluxe Sewing Kit' to use as a container.  (unless
Varant changes their mind again)

On the new 'role play preferred' server, I have one character so far and
it's not close to the 'pirates in Ice Clad' for the 'deluxe toolkits',
nor high enough level(6th) to have the money for 10-slot backpacks.  Is
there any other places to get 10-slot 'deluxe toolkits'?
