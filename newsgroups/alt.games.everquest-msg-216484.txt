No, I'm arguing that after we get buffed, why should we wait around for the
cleric to have enough mana for WWIII just to start nowing through blues?

If I get to a room of 5 and have a shaman and three "tanks" in the group
(ranger, rogue, monk, paladin, shadowknight, warrior, well-played wizard or
enchanter, and hell, the shaman too) why bother taking the time to split it
at all.  Just eat it, and if the cleric has to burn some extra mana and gets
down to 30%, why waste time waiting for him to med back up for another
5-pull that won't be happening anytime soon (generally only 1 or 2 rooms per
LDoN dungeon that you can get 5 mobs on even if you're trying for big
pulls, and I haven't seen two in a row yet).

Mana is a resource.  We all agree with that.  I'm just willing to throw mana
at a big fight, or buffing, or LD issues, or whatever, and then continue
pulling 99.9% confident that lightning isn't going to strike twice in quick
succession, and 99.8% confident that even if it does we'll be able to squeak
it.
