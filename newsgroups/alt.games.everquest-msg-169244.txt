Overpowered; although soloing ability involves a lot of sudden death, with a
partner or grouped or in a raid they are a high powered tool indeed.  Don't
stack well though.

Overpowered, unless you really care about soloing.  If anyone is willing to
stand in front of the mob and suck up damage, or the mob is kept stunned or
feared, rogue damage output is hard to argue with.  In a raid, there's ALWAYS
someone else designated to stand in front of that mob.

Underpowered.  Real power comes from grouping and raiding, ability to solo just
isn't that important... and they are no better than 6th best soloer class
anyway.  Ease of soloing isn't Power in soloing.  While they can bring a lot to
a group, this isn't widely recognized, so the fact is they don't get to perform
those functions much.  On a raid level, they have little to contribute that
some other class couldn't do better.

Underpowered.  Poor soloers, not really needed for groups, raiding is the only
place where they really shine.  If you consider ONLY raids, overpowered.

Underpowered.  Very poor soloers, no better than decent in a group, raids are
again the only place they shine.  If you consider ONLY raids, slightly
overpowered.

Yeah, balanced, I agree completely.  Among the best soloers, great in a group,
fantastic on raids, stack nicely... yep, balanced on the TOP of the pyramid.

This is probably the baseline class all others should be judged by.  Once
overpowered in a raid, group, or even just partnered with a healer, they are
now (post rod nerf) dead center in the solo, group, and raid bars.

I'll grant you this one as well, among the better soloers, decent group
members, a bit lacking in raid function... although I suspect this is because
they are underutilized as healers on raids.  Hopefully the new Raid function
will stop them doing so much nuking to get the KS, and they can concentrate on
doing whichever swiss army knife function is best needed at the time.

Underpowered.  They solo decently during the 50s, but not so well before or
after, in most groups they have relatively little effect, on raids they have a
decent but hardly pivotable effect in most encounters, although nice for big
mobs with high damage output but low HP totals.

Balanced.  They can solo (not top of the line, but not near the bottom either,
if you let them pick the battleground) contribute to groups as long as not
forced to take the Sponge role, and are good damage producers in a raid.  There
are certainly better in each category, but that doesn't take away from ranger
mediocrity.

I don't know much about them really.  So so damage output, decent tanking
capability, nice aggro grabbers, can fear kite to solo... I'd guess soloing and
grouped they are balanced but I don't see much of a role on raids other than
possibly as offtanker... for a while I thought monks would give up the FD
puller role to shadowknights, but SK FD is a much less reliable thing when you
really need it.

While paladins are poor soloers, they are more useful in exp groups than either
warriors or shadowknights as the MA; they grab aggro faster than warriors, and
come equipped with decent group healing and spot healing which allows them to
function as group backup healer, while sponging nearly as well as warriors on
the sort of continual basis that exp flow demands, and they come with a very
powerful line of stuns, and root, which warriors lack.  On a raid, they lose
out to real healers, real damage producers, real sponges, again with the
possible exception of offtanker of choice due to ease of grabbing aggro.  I
suppose since they are poor at soloing and on raids, I'd have to say
underpowered after all.
