Did ya read every reply before coming to this conclusion ?

Starting new threads, hmm  Thanks for the suggestion. Now, if you had any
sense and actually meant what you posted, you would have blocked the whole
thread. But then, who would know you were anybody ?

 Do me a favor, don't respond because your whole reply shows no thought,
less then educated, and a total wanna-be. Now, go rotate the tires on your
house Jerry.

lol , Groupies
