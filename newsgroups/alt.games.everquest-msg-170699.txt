I find you get a lot of disorganization, lack of skill utilization etc at
the lower levels because you CAN (not should though) get away with it.
Most people were probably solo'ing up till about that point, so they didnt
really utilize their group skills/tactics etc, so unless they are directed
on what to do and how to do it, they are going to continue trying to solo
in that group situation.  And unfortunately if people like that are not
directed and taught, they end up costing lives at the later levels when
they wander off to start pulling things, dont assist, break mez, no
taunting etc.
