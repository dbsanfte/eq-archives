I personally didn't start with the manual. Didn' get any help until I got my
second computer and I started surfing Eqatlas for maps while playing. I
learned by playing on my Bro's computer and having him laugh at me while I
learned how to play. Never got twinked by him because I moved, then bought
eq, and started on a different server and he quit before he could hook me up
lol. but then again I don't think I've honestly read a faq/game manual
before I started playing a game ever before. Makes a game more fun imo heh.

And as for the tutorial. IIRC if you get the tutorial, it will be gone as
soon as you patch. Or am I wrong? I seem to remember reading something to
that effect a LONG time ago... correct me if I am (most likely) wrong heh.
