The tech lead at Verant acknowledged problems with the sound engine, and
claimed they are working on it.

FYI, I've been running SB Live! on Win2000 ever since I started playing in
July.  It has never worked right.  However, it works great on Win98.
On the other hand, after Luclin, the sound even on Win98 is muted and dull
sounding.  They broke something.

I may get a different sound card if this continues.  It seems that SB Live! is the
only card on Win2000/XP where these sort of problems exist.
