My guildies have done 2 forays to SolC, granted most of them are low 50 
and really have no business going there.  The first day they didn't even 
find the entrance and everyone died at least twice, my hubby died 5 
times.  Second time was last night, I knew it wasnt' going to be pretty 
when I hear hubby yelling directions to one of the guildies over the 
phone, "You gotta swim up thru there, Argh, I'm still in the lava!" etc 
etc.  Not being a big fan of lava to begin with, I got lost in a PS2 
game all night so he wouldn't make me 'help'.  5 hours later, yes I 
timed it because my game kept track of how long I had played,  they 
finally got all the corpses out of the zone.  Don't think they killed a 
dang thing and I'm pretty sure hubby died about 7 times.  The cleric he 
was on the phone with kept saying, "hold up, I gotta rez the kitty 
again"  Hubby plays a vahshir BL.

My advice: don't go unless you have high fire resist and are higher than 55.
