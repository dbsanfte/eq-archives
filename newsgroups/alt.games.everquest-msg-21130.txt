    Quellious has a constant churn of lower-level guilds. We are the Soap
Opera server of EQ - constant strife, all of it minor, which makes people
disband and start things in a huge huff.

    Now, remember: all these opinions are of a currently unguilded cleric at
level 58. What I say is NOT gospel.

>Several that have caught my eye (by web pages not in EQ) are:
>Dragons Bane

    Has been around a long time, would likely be quite stable. Don't know
how they are towards lower-level players like yourself - the older a guild
is, the more likely they're beginning to turn towards being "raid-only".
They were at the center of the Quellious Quarters controversy, and haven't
seemed the same since - what few people I've known in DB have moved on to
other guilds.

>Storm Mountain

    I just left them, so this guild I know about. ;-) SM is trying to become
a raid guild, but they don't yet have the personnel. They're still open to
lower-level players, especially "needed classes". Recently, one bad apple
was in the guild, and his whining about people not helping him with his epic
has created a HUGE outflux of people from the guild. Many left to avoid the
bickering, many left because many others left and they wanted to raid a lot
(which SM can't do if people keep leaving). The leader recently had a RL
tragedy involving his nephew that kept him away from game for a few critical
weeks, and that did NOT help stem the outflow.

    That having been said, they are a very friendly bunch of people. The
"d00d" factor is quite low for a guild as open with invites as they are. If
the people who left over "greed" came back, SM would be a great guild to be
a part of. As for why I left, well, after a friend of mine in SM left the
game, and another jumped guilds, I didn't really know anyone and I didn't
really do anything with any of the others. I didn't feel right being the
"top cleric" in a guild I didn't really raid with. (I despise raids, BTW.)

>Crush and Swill

    Crush and Swill has also been around a long time, so must have a degree
of stability. I do not know much about them, other than they shout to each
other when they zone - an annoying habit, to be sure.

    I'll give you a site where you can get info on many guilds:

http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth

    This is as close to a Quellious message board as exists now. It's mostly
deserted of posters, but there are many that read it now and again.

    Truthfully, if you want a new guild, here's what I'd recommend: after a
successful time in a group, ask the people who seemed nice enough and are
guilded about their guilds - what do they do together, how many, recruiting
policies, etc. You can use a /who all "guildname" beforehand to check on
size, approximate levels, and if you know anyone else already. That approach
is more likely to get you into a guild that suits you than any web search.
