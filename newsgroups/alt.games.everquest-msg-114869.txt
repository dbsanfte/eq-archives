Before I cast my vote, first let me say this.  I honestly don't think that
any particular class or race draws rude people.  I have seen almost every
class and race be rude, either to me directly or just acting like a five
year old over some issue in /occ or /shout.
Some of what people consider rudeness or arogance in some classes, is really
due to the pressures of that class.  Druids, Clerics, Necros, Ench, Shamies,
and Bards (I am leaving out Pali's and Rangers because they do not get the
spells in demand until a much higher level) all have spells and songs that
players of other classes want cast on them.  It can really wear a person
down when they are always being bothered for a SoW or a Breeze.  Myself as a
bard I have zones that I will go /anon if I am in because of my corpse loc
song.  You have to learn how to say no, or just ignore people or you could
easily spend 90 percent of your time on EQ running around making other
people happy.
I used to help everyone who asked for help finding a corpse, and I still
feel that urge to automatically do it.  But now I make myself say no unless
I am right by them, or they have honestly been trying to find their corpse
for at least half an hour with no luck.
Now on to my vote.......Bards.
I have been playing over two years now and I have yet to run into a rude
bard or see one get caught up in petty zonewide bickering. Also I have
noticed, at least on my server, that with the new chat channels every class
has the opportunity to have its own chat.  Other then the Bard channel I
have yet to see anyone in any other class based channel, and the Bard
channels has on average 6 or more people on it.
One last thing when it comes to people being jerks, EQ has relativly few.
Compare number of real life jerks you would see in a week to the number you
would see on EQ.  Also please and thank you seem much more in fashion on EQ.
People just need to not give the jerks what they want.  Don't respond to
them and don't let it bug you, I mean why let one person ruin five hours of
gameplay......and remember you can always /igonre.
