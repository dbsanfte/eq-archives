Short, but with much news.

=================================

EverQuest - Live Update - 08/11/05
----------------------------------

*** Headlines ***
----------------------------------
Gukta is no more.  The Trolls have retaken their ancestral home and torn 
down the remembrances of the Frogloks.  The Guktans, suffering more than 
just defeat, have retreated into the Rathe Mountains.  They have built a 
tent city to accommodate their needs, but there is something obviously 
wrong.  Many of their friends and family were touched by the curse laid upon 
the battlefield by the Warlord Ykesha. These poor souls have been corrupted. 
They have been torn from the breast of Mithaniel Marr and grasped by the 
clutching claws of Innoruuk and turned to evil.  Yet they are cousins and 
brothers to the remaining Guktans and so they live together, trying to make 
the best of their fate.


*** Items ***
----------------------------------
- Ancient Mist Root Stone, Refracted Dusk Amethyst, Ancient Life Root Stone, 
and Refracted Dawn Amethyst are now usable in the hands and wrist slots.
- All potions that were recently introduced now have a required level 
instead of a recommended level.
- Lightning Singed Mantle now has 38 AC.


*** Missions ***
----------------------------------
- Changed the required count for the kill and loot elements on the Dragons 
of Norrath mission "Diseased Pumas". This change was to fix a discrepancy 
between the number of items required for task completion compared to the 
number of kills and items looted that the task said you needed.
