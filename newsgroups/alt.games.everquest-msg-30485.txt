Ah, right, I didn't notice that he was a Druid.  My Paladin
had to schlep his butt all the way to FV on foot.

That's a dangerous enough run at 25-30 that instead I
just spent 4 levels "out in the field", never once
visiting a vendor or bank (I had Iksar friends shuttle
supplies to me and change little coins to big ones).

By the time I finally went into town, I had this funny
feeling that I really needed a bath.  :-)
