Oooooh. Good call.

The game has in game casinos, the game has player run casinos, and even 
mob drops are borderline slot machines -- whack a mob, get a prize 
(maybe)... the whole game is one big random number generator...

Then attach official support for linking $$$ to the 'prizes'.

Might even be enough potential liability right there for them to scrap 
the whole idea. Here's hoping :)

And that's without even touching on the QS issues. Real casinos actually 
have to be able to demonstrate and validate their equipment is all 
working...
