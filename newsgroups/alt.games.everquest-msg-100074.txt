Neriak Commons has crashed on me lots of times. From the foreign 
quarter, cross over the bridge, through the main portcullis, turn left, 
through the little portcullis, turn left to look at the forge and bang. 
Happens about 1 in 20 times - just enough to be annoying.

I would think it was my configuration if it hadn't happened on 3 
seperate PCs and 4 seperate graphics chipsets. I've /bug'ed it lots of 
times but Verant doesn't seem to have done anything about it.
