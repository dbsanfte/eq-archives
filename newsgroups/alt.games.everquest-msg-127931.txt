I'd be fine with them removing at - as long as all my stuff would end up in
my ressurected body - which is by far the worst feature of the game.  Just
let me take the XP hit, that sucks enough.

If it weren't for /loc there's often little or no way to find a corpse if
you're lost/swimming/whatever.

The argument, well you're dying what do you expect?  Yeah..  well, if I
didn't ocasionally get KOS by bizzare creatures in supposedly safe zones
then it'd not be as bad.
