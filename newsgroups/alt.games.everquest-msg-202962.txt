It doesn't.  Not anymore.  You and your group can't get a KEI any more, so
you cannot adversely affect my gaming experience any longer.

Given that, there's nothing to explain.

And, btw, why are you still playing?  You lost.  KEI has been changed.  I
don't have to explain a thing, not to you or anyone else.  My side won.

Nothing in this whole wide world you can do about it. All the whimpering ...
all the whining ... all the chest thumping ... all the stalking ... it's
just not going to change the basic fact.  When I log into the game, the
experience is to my liking, not yours.

Remember that each and everytime you log on.  Think to yourself ... Crash is
happy.  Crash is trotting through the PoK happy as a lark at this very
moment.  And there's not a damn thing I can do about it.

Please let me repeat for emphasis ... You Lost.

Awaiting your response with eager anticipation.  Could this be the one?
Will you hit the mark this time?

Crash
