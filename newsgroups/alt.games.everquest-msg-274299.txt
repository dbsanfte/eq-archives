If they were wearing South Carolina shirts that said "Cocks" on the
front, they might have something of a defense in regards to the
suspension.  Innuendo or no, the name "Hooters" is established and on
a shirt, sign or other advertisment it clearly refers to the chain.
There is a built in defense that is not inherent in a shirt that
merely shows a rooster with the word "cocks" unless it is a clear
reference to a product or brand of some sort.

On top of that, "hooters" when used as slang for breasts is viewed
much less seriously than "cock" as used as a slang reference to the
penis. In the USA at least.  They would have been better off wearing
shirts that said "johnsons" with a picture of a hot dog or something,
because at least then they would not have been displaying a word that
is generally considered vulgar by society.  

The girls were foolish and deserved their suspension.  In the end all
they did was provide a little more publicity for Hooters.  As is this
thread actually.
