Yep but at 44 you are still using VoS (lvl39 59 per tick) and Scourge (lvl34
24 pet tick) dots (83 unfocused per tick).  At 49 you get both Envenomend
Bolt (149 per tick) , Plague (55 per tick) (204 unfocused per tick), and a
new pet, which is a dramatic increase in power.  I think I got canni ii at
about 46ish with some help.

Worded it badly, but what I meant was there is a significant power jump at
49 :)
