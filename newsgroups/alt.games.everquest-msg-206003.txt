Something that comes to mind is in the qeynos area.  Basically get
something from each zone up to Halas (Qeynos, Qeynos Hills,
Blackburrow, Everfrost Peaks)

Something along the lines of
Qeynos - 5 Batwings
Qeynos Hills - 5 Large Whiskered Bat Fur (dont want them killing wolves)
Blackburrow - 5 Patch of Gnoll Fur
Everfrost Peaks - 2 Polar Bear Hides (need to make that one a bit more difficult)
Halas - Contestants MUST swim across (have someone stationed on the "boat"
to make sure they do not take it [will also come in handy later])  Then
then need to find Marton Stringinger and get the mail from them.  Then
deliver the mail to your representative on the boat.

Something along those lines should be fun :) Though this will basically
only work for good races.  Perhaps Let people know this will be going on
so they can create a character (allow only under level 10, no speed
enhancement spells/songs, etc.)
