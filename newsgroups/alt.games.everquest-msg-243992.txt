Shawl is one groupable.  I had 10 to 12 people there when I did mine, but 
was way overkill even then.  FT3 boots from Cazic Thule is one groupable.  
So, with never a single raid, just grouping in the right places, in the 
60s, you can hit FT10.  Solstice is cash.  For priest classes, you can 
add another FT4 from two ornate bracers, 100ishK each (Mine was 70k).  
For Int casters, they get FT3 I think, never looked into it all that 
seriously.  Anyone can get to FT15 without ever seeing a raid if they 
really want to, and don't have to be level 65 even.  It requires a lot of 
time and cash is all.  Still, high end game, sure, I'd agree.
