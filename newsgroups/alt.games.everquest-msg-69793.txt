I don't know how you can say that, I think the new graphics are a huge
improvemnet. But you are entitled to your opinion.

But that's all they have done for the last 2 years. The previous two
expansions were just content. Time to upgrade the fundementals as
well.

Sadly not possible. I suspect the new contents depends on the new engine
to work, and you can't roll in new archtiecture and models to any great
degree.

No, you'd have ended up with the new zones being like the retextured
old zones. They are an improvement but not like the new zones which
are amazingly better.

Yeah well they can fix this kind of thing easily enough. Give them a couple
of weeks.
