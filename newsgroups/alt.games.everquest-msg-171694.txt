E'ci was like this for a while, a few weeks ago.   One or two crashes a day
almost every day.   And it went on for almost two weeks.

Maybe they've just got one bad server and they're swapping it around so each

Well, at least they restored the armor I lost when the first crash happened.
Although it did take them over a week of petitions to get to it.
