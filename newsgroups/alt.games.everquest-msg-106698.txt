Once again, it's a matter of you just having to have the mana.  For pallys,
it's simply not an option.  I'd say the advantage goes to the druids.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
