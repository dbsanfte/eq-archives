I think some new ones are better, some old ones are better.

The elves certainly god uglier IMO, although I like what they did with
the dark elves.

Barbarians and Trolls were much needed improvements.  The old trolls
just looked poorly designed and the old Barbies were too plain. 
Actually what I would really like to see is the Ykeshan trolls as PC
models.  Now those things *look* like trolls.

I actually would prefer the old Ogres to the new ones, though I admit
they were pretty ridiculous.

Erudites got worse...damn foreheads.

Asslings definitely got better.

Elementals...much better.  Instead of the same stupid model with four
different colors...

Humans I would probably say is a toss up, although I think that new
humans look very...homosexual when they run.

Oh and Iksar, much better.  Although when I first tried the new models
for them I was disappointed, they have grown on me.
