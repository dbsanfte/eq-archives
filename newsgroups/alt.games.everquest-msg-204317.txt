Man, has the whole world gone necro?  This has to be at least the 5th necro
where to hunt question in the past couple of weeks.  Here are a couple of
hunting guides you could check out:

I think the Legionnaires in Katta Castellum would be steady, but a bit
boring.  You can start with the ones in the main entryway - I think you can
single pull them at your level.  If not, the zoneline is just a few feet
away.  If they're camped, try the lego's in the bank area.  The gnolls in
JaggedPine can be nice, there's a room with a bunch standing around in a
room in one of the back caves, but getting to that room without aggroing a
wandering gnoll shammie with see invis up can be a pain.  One or two of the
ships in Dulak's harbor would probably be good, but on my server they are
perma-camped.
