What is with all the sudden problems with EverQuest holding a connection
lately? Besides the fact that as EQ gets older and older that game will
crash more and more while zoning, it's got this new problem - when you
attempt to zone you crash to the server select screen and get this
message when trying to log back on:

"Error 1018: You currently have an active character on that EverQuest
Server, please allow a minute for synchronization and try again."

Not an uncommon message for those of us that have gone linkdead in the
past. But instead of 30 seconds it literally takes 10 full minutes for
"synchronization" to figure out there in nobody playing a character in
the EverQuest world! It is most annoying having your group wait 10
minutes for you to return every time you zone.

This does not just happen when you go linkdead, it happens when you CAMP
to the character select screen too, so that there really is no active
character about for the game to sync up to!

What's going on Verant? Is this going to be fixed?
