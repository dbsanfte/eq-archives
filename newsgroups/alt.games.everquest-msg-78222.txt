Has anybody bothered to put all this log parsing crap up on a webpage
somewhere?  I'd like to look at some of this stuff myself..

My 51 druid was kinda in the same boat.  My first real character and I
had no idea what stats did, so I spread it all out pretty evenly.  His
base wisdom is only 85.  :-(

Swiftclaw Sash.  Something like 10% haste I think.  Decent, but since
me and some friends of mine are going to get our Seb keys (with my
druid), I'm just gonna park my ranger there by the zone and see if I
can't pick up a Hangmans Noose.  And a regen BP.  :-)

As is my habit with my druid, EVERYTHING get's snared from the get go.
Rarely does snare drop before I get it recast.  I'm horribly, horribly
anal about it.  It's saved my druids ass WAY to many times.

Heh.

I only have the BA Legs and girdle at this point.  :-)  And as for
STR, it does SEEM to have a noticeable effect on damage output, at
least on my warrior.  Shammy friend buffed the shit out of his STR
once and it SEEMED like he was hitting harder. 

SEEM is obviously the magic word here though.  I could have very well
just been seeing what I wanted and/or just got some good combat rolls.

If str is really all insignificant, it might move down the list.
Depends on how much Phat Lewt I wanna carry around.  :-)
