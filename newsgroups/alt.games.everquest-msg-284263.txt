Whining.  Bitching.  Venting.  I guess its all in how you look at it. 
Me, sometimes when something annoys me, I like to complain about it to 
other people who are going thru the same thing. Sharing the camraderie 
of my fellow sufferers, perhaps nudge someone else into noticing that 
there's something lacking, or perhaps being enlightened as to some facet 
I don't know about the situation which would make me less, well, grumpy 
about it. I don't fool myself into thinking its a great revelation to 
you, or that its actually going to effect change.  But it increases my 
net happiness.

Problem on my end, I'd say once a year on average since the game 
started.  DirectX a frequent culprit, but also corrupted files, on a 
couple occaisions ones that had to be deleted by hand.  I'm surprised to 
hear you had a different experience, but I suppose its a mathematical 
possibility; if so, then you'll have to imagine what it might be like.

Is it a valium moment?  No, honestly, I'm not much on drugs myself, and 
its just not that big a thing, for me the correct response is to mention 
it offhand in a newsgroup dedicated to just this sort of topic, to, as I 
put it, Vent.
