Dawnshroud Peaks in Luclin is by far the best exp Ive seen yet. Killing
small Zelniaks or the plain ones gave me 1/2 to 3/4 blue bub per kill all
the way to 39. I made it from 30-39 in less then 2 weeks here and I dont
play that much. Granted the loot is pretty crappy, but youcan also kill the
lightcrawlers and then sell the armor you make from the shells. I have
gotten rich and leveled here.
