Oh surely not.  Put cleric up up up this list now.

Two time sink camps on level 40 mobs in easy zones.  One one group mob, one two
group mob, one small raid mob, each "always up".  Another time sink farming
sub-50 level mobs (or just hanging out in the zone and looting when someone
announces the drop) and then a triggered small raid kill (was one group kill
before the MB nerf).  The hardest thing about the whole quest now is waiting for
Zordak in SolB!  I'd rate this as about the same difficulty level as the rogue
quest, if not easier.

Further, its far and away the easiest if you consider difficulty of getting
help.
