Ehh.... EQ uses a lot more than 4 machines per server....

EC alone takes about 2 machines per server, as do most of the major
populated zones, most semi used zones take 1 machine or so, and the
abandoned zones can be put together maybe 2 or 3 zones/machine (abandoned,
EG, Droga, Nurga, Kedge, Kerra Ridge, Runnyeye, Cazic-Thule, Arena)

Then you have the Login Server, theres another cluster of computers
(probably 2 for redundancy)
and the World Server, which ties all the individual zones together, probably
a few machines there too.

VI had stated a while back that they run their servers on normal PCs (I
heard 650MHz at the time), not these 10 million dollar each supercomputers
that some people think.
