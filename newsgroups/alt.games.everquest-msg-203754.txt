Apparently "a glass eye" is an item that was meant to be made for a 
quest. However, the writers never got around to writing the quest into 
the program for it.

A few things missed the cut when they released Luclin including the 
extension of the Netherbian Lair which was apparently meant to be a 
sprawling dungeon, similar in kind to Echo, but more ghastly and suited 
to the crowd who had just leveled past Paludal Caverns.

On another note - have you noticed how all of these places such as 
Paludal Caverns, Dawn Shroud Peaks, etc, etc. (level 10-40 zones) are 
convieniently located near the Bazaar. This must have been intentional. 
The ridiculous xp bonus in Paludal is almost as bad as what KEI was at 
that level. Combined you're just making a PL paradise. Too many people 
level 30-40 (some even higher thanks to the Auctions) have no idea what 
their class means but enough to know where to get the XP.

Has this effected the end-game big-name raids on most servers?
