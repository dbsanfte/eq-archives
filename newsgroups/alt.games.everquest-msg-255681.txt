in order to use the magelo tool to automatically update a website with your 
character info,  you have to download the file.  Just put it anywhere you 
want it.  You'll have to pay a nominal fee to use the auto-updater.  If you 
don't want to use the auto-updater, all you have to do is make a magelo 
account, add your character names to it and put in your items one by one on 
the character sheet page.  That way is very time consuming.
