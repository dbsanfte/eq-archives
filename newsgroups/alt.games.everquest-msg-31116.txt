If it is the same language, a person with one point in Gnoll for instance
that wants to raise it and another person with 0 skill in Gnoll that wants
to learn it.

You only have to zone the first time to get the new language as a menu
choice so it can be *spammed back*. After that, you only zone to see what
the change/status of the language is.

IIRC: The lack of changes on skill status bar requiring you to zone before
they are updated are pretty well known. Verant has publically stated that
the skill does function at the actual level vs the displayed.
