Kobe008 vandalized the alt.games.everquest bathroom wall with:

K> Lvl 21 Barbarian Shaman and using a Mace taken from one of the ice giants in
K> Everfrost.  It does 8 dmg with I think a 30 sec delay.  Where in the Classic

8/30 or 8/38?  Fine Steel (which drops off of the ice giants is 8/38 if I
recall correctly).  Having only the origional EQ limits you a bit as to
what you can get.  You may want to check with your guildmaster in
Everfrost, I belive there a bunch of quests now that you can do to get
some items.  Also what server are you on?
