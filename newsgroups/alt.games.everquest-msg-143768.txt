I consider that a small concern.  We've all got the potential to be in that
class if we do desire.

Tucker got took, certainly.  It means he wasn't careful enough.  Even so,
there are many more small successes.  You don't have to become insanely rich
to have "made it."

Nor would they be equal under a socialist society.  ANY society will
stratify, it's human nature.

I wouldn't say "everybody."  There were many who weren't affected by the
Depression.  Most of those were in the beltway, though.  Anyways, where do
you think the basis for the "Pax Americana" came from?  Certainly, the
middle class wasn't as affluent in the 1800's as it was in the 20th century,
but it was the foundation for the makeup of society that would extend
through the depression and re-assert itself in the war and post-war era.

Come stand watch in 2 Main Macinery Room and tell me that.  Make sure you
wait until we're in the Arabian Gulf in the summer to visit.

I wonder if it is, or if it is only percieved to be so because it's views
have become the dominant ones?  I have a feeling that it's the former, but I
still retain my prejudices against using fiction as evidence.

I tend to think socialism is a poison to capitalism.  Of course, I don't
view every bit of regulation as socialist.  Even so, true socialism is more
closely related to capitalism than the fascist-communist governments that
are associated with it today.  The tendancy to make stocks part of employee
compensation packages is a move in that direction.  Now, the workers do own
a bit of the company (the means of production).  It has both capitalist and
socialist benefits.

Having money simply isn't enough.  You have to be able to put it to use.
Also, when 90% of our millionaires are first-generation (as measured before
the .com boom), it is merit based, to a large extent.  Also, as I said
above, any society will stratify.  The only question is, to what extent, and
along what lines?

Whether you think social security is a good thing or not, I've got to ask
the question... what right does government have to force me to pay into it?

Long before welfare, there were private charities that did such work.    The
other problem is that it puts the government right in people's path again.
What's the first thing people do when they get laid off?  They don't start
sending out resumes, they start filling out unemployement paperwork.  When
did we learn to rely on the government?

All a candidate has to say is "If my opponent gets elected, you'll have to
start paying taxes."  That would be enough to guarntee election.
