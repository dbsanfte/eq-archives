You'll probably need to be at least 15 before going to Lake of Ill Omen.  On
Tallon Zek, there weren't a whole lot of people grouping for exp, so you
probably won't have as much of a problem on VZ with d00dz than you would on
an older server where the zone population can get toward 100 people at peak
time.  As for PKers, most of them were in the 25-40 range so you may not
have to worry much about that, but I'm not sure how different the
demographics will be on VZ.
