Three: Isreal and Palistine BOTH become states and have their own
governments with EACH having access to their most holy sites. And probably
with Jerusalem as a free city, with UN peacekeepers at first. A framework
for the removal of Kibbutz' from West Bank areas, a compensation package to
Isreal for removing the Kibbutz (paid by US), a payment plan to Syria for
the Golan Heights (also paid by the US) and the water rights distributed in
a 50/50 or a per capita basis between Palistine and Israel.
