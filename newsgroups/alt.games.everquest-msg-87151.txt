Whoa, slow down. Did you see the ";-)"?

I have no issues with one of the posters I respect the most posting helpful
and friendly advice[1] - er, like what would be the point?
Not like you can even use a EQ hotkey in Mozilla, or any other newsreader I
ever used (hmm, but theres an idea - nah, wouldn't work).

The humour was purely based on the fact that I had seen this advice a few
times, which meant you had to have typed the same thing a few time - and
repetitive typing can be a chore - oh, and this is an EQ group where we
often see discussions on how to set up hotkeys.

Sorry I seemed to have upset you so much  - if you still see me as an
asshole[2] send me an email so I can defend myself in more detail (ie 'take
it to tells').

by a common language.

[1] Heh, or anyone posting helpful and friendly advice.
[2] See, I used the American version rather than the English (Arsehole)
