Thats exactly why.  The whole database got corrupted, they tried to
individually restore people (which for the most part was 30mins before the
first crash), some things were deleted or missing, and if you petitioned
this, they would keep going back in stages (ie yesterdays backup, the day
befores backup)

There was also an issue with the backups not being as reliable as they
should have been.. so if you logged on and all your items were gone, you
were rolled back three days.. which for me would have been 3-7 AA levels,
depending on raids/days
