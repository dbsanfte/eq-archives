Yep, but then EQ was the original game of it's type, and it is now what, 8
years old?

GoD is a great expansion imo :P

Yes, due to it's age it is not exactly noobie friendly, but there are still
plenty of guilds out there who would be more than likely happy to group with
you etc.  Really, you do need a guild if you are a lowbie in EQ now, or you
stand no chance.

Why did you sell your character? :P

All of what you said still doesnt change the fact it IS more difficult than
any other MMORPG (possible exception vanguard, I haven't played that for
more than an hour).

My g/f just started playing eq, has a level 9 mage, and is loving it, of
course she has me to help her learn how to play, but, that isn't something
unique.  Any other newbie could just as easily ask for help in one of the
general channels or find a guild with helpful members.

I dont see the barrier you are harping on about.
