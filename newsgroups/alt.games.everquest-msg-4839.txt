You might consider putting 10 or 15 points into tailoring, save up for a
large sewing kit (vendor at top of newbie lift), and some patterns (same
vendor, and vendor to west), and make some patchwork armor from some ruined
wolf pelts. You probably want to buy leather later, but this will help a lot
in the meantime.

Theres a quest in kaladim where you hand in 4 bone chops to some guy in the
paladins guild (gunlok jure?), and he gives you some xp, money and maybe
some armor. This is another good way to get some armor. Dont stack the chips
when you give them to him tho.

I wouldnt spend training points on anything else until level 8 (or is it 9?)
when you can put 1 point into meditate. Combat and magic skills will go up
on their own.

I use auto attack... always have. Target the creature and hit a.

Dont worry about that letter... you havnt missed out on much.
