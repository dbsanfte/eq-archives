Go to the library in PoK.  There are stair wells on the corners that are 12
floors high.  Run up several floors and jump off.  Note the damage taken,
and go up a few more floors next jump.  Continue to jump from floors based
on what is now a known average damage for any given floor.

Thus, you can pretty well control the amount of damage being taken, and when
to stop.  You should be able to safely get near to zero health, then bandage
up from there.

Occasionally, well meaning passers by will heal you, but that is the only
down side.

On a few occasions, I have taken enough damage to produce negative health,
but in all of those incidents I recovered from the near death.

Thus, you run up both your safe fall skill and bandage skill in the same
interval.
