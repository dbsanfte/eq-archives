The way I see it with the recent nerfs...

VI said monks were stepping on warriors toes with their tankability (which
is very highly debatable..)

So monks were nerfed.  MOST of you even agreed/supported it.

Now VI is saying your stepping on FD pulling classes toes with your ability
to ALWAYS INSTANTLY single pull a mob outdoors (and dungeons flagged as
outdoors) - unlike monks thats not debatable, its fact.

So harmony was nerfed.  Now the people who were so happy/smug about monks
are crying in their pillows.. well you know what, tough shit.

Im not happy you got nerfed, I dont really wish nerfs upon anybody.  I do
agree with their reasoning for it though, and its undeniable what they
claim.

Rangers who do EW evil dorfs are gonna be hard hit, but you know, that camp
is damn hard to split with FD.  Why should a utility class (with so many
other abilities) have a foolproof 100% reliable mechanism to single pull it?

Nobody else had a foolproof 100% reliable and safe way to pull, and now
druids/rangers are getting nerfed... I fail to see how/what you can whine
about.
