| I have alwas wondered.  If you start a new toon.  And you know to save
your spiderling/spider silk  and various pelts to resell then use that money
to buy gear. Is that considered twinking?

Pfht. No, that's just being wise and knowing how to earn money in EQ.
Twinking is, as others have said, having your level 50-60 character give
really, really, REALLY nice armor, weapons, etc. to a character who, ( IMO,
really dosent benefit from them till skill development is on par and
therefor a waste of time ) is getting rabied by a mummy.  I like playing EQ
with fresh characters. Maybe bring in 10 or so plat for the first couple
spells, but earn the armor and weapons on his own.
