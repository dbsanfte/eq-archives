There is a conjurer class which has *roughly* the same
basic concept -- a pet class, with pet buffs, pet heals,
etc.   Pet armor/weapons don't exist.   Mod rods DO
exist.    So, yes, there's a *similar* class - but it's NOT
the same class.

Mage -> Summoner -> Conjurer.

Remember it's NOT the same class, though.
