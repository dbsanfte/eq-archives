Throwing weapons and ranged weapons are there for melee characters to have
a ranged attack, more so for Rogue, Warriors and Monks, given they do not
really have the ability to do Direct Damage blasts as Rangers do.  Also,
Rogues have the chance of doing critical hits with thrown items.  It is a
matter of the skill and the class.  Rangers also have the ability to do
more damage with arrows.

The real crux of the issue though, is how much skill is invested, the level
of the mob (Since AC has a lot to do with it.) and the item being used for
ranged attacks.  A good bow with good arrows is bound to do more damage
than a bad bow with weak arrows.  I have even seen Rangers kite mobs with
arrows, thowing the occasional snare/root then plinking a mob with arrows.
