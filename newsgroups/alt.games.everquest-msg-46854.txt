Even more recent reports show that most of the Midwest is crawling with

Another report shows that the kid sitting next to me on the bus is a

Um. The rest of my life. Hrm. Well, it's gonna be spent a lot like the

OOoooookay. I'm going to point something out here that some people
probably don't know. If a nuke goes off today, a bomb shelter isn't going
to help you unless its 1/2 to 1 mile underground. Modern nuclear weapons
are so powerful that they would easily rip through the crap that was used
to make those 50's shelters. Modern ICBM's are planet destroyers and a
suitcase nuke is just too sneaky to be prepared for by hiding in a bomb
shelter.

Gas masks won't help you in a chemical attack. You need a full NBC suit
(Nuclear, Biological, Chemical). A lot of boys in the Desert thought they
could get away with just a gas mask. They came home with "unexplained
illnesses".

: it's when sadly.

If someone goes to the scale of using NBC style weapons, it's not about
being prepared. It's about being lucky. If someone commits an act of
terrorism, it's not about having supplies, it's about finding them before
they act or being lucky enough to not be in the area.

If you honestly believe that a single gas mask with a charcoal filter is
going to save you from a chemical or biological attack, I have about 300
of them I can sell you at $19.95 a piece (I should make an awesome profit
here...hehehe).

The scale of weaponry that is available today is beyond that which we can
"prepare" for. If people start tossing nukes, this world is
over. Literally. The crust will buckle under the force, crack, and most of
the planet will be reduced to *barren nothingness*. If you manage to
survive, you will die soon after not from nuclear winter or from
radiation. But from the sheer fact that most of the planet is now
wiped barren.

If people start tossing chemical weapons, you're going to need a lot more
than gas masks and plastic suits. Modern chemical agents eat through weak
plastics and dissolve some of the most interesting things. As to
biological weapons, I can say that no bio weapon will kill 100% of the
world's population. Of course, it might come close...

My point being, there's no real way to defensively prepare for this. You
can't dig a hole and tuck your head in when the storm comes in. A lot of
Americans have always felt that the US should stay out of other country's
affairs and that the US should go back to being an isolationist
nation. Well, now you see why we can't. We cannot "defend" against these
attacks because we have to be on the offensive. We have to pursue and
chase the people who might be committing these acts and we have to look
into them. We cannot just build shelters and then scurry into them like
rats whenever the shit hits the fan. We have to stop the attacks from ever
occurring.
