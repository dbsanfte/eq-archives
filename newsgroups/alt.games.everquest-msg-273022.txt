Hi All;

Quick question if I may.

When I browse the market and buy something, I go straight to the player's 
room and buy direct to save the 20% broker fee.  Twice lately, I've seen the 
item I want and it says that it's from "Bubba" in the XYZ Inn.  There is no 
town or anything I can identify as to where the XYZ Inn is.  I assume that 
this is a guild hall or something.

My question:  How can I buy direct from a player/trader that is in a place 
like this, if I've never heard of it, nor know where it is?

Thanks in advance for your time and help.
