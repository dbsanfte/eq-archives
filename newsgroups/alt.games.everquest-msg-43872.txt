I don't think you get what I'm saying or you don't get the TCC. No one
of an appropriate level to do kaesora does it.. in fact NO ONE does
kaesora AT ALL for the most part. Its empty 24/7. So how would trivial
combat code change that? Explain that to me please. What I was saying
was that if it WAS trivial combat code the zone would be a total waste
of space since as it is now sometimes a couple higher level people go
in when bored and get one item. Its kind of a death trap even when the
things are outrageously green.

You go to kaesora and do it at an appropriate level for xp and drops.
The thing is its just too hard at an appropriate level. If it wasn't
lower groups might go there but a trivial code there would be moot
either way.

Everyone who disagrees with you is not a "whiner." disagreeing is not
"whining." I don't call you a "whiner" or say you are "whining" in
this post. 

TCC is not going to "Avoid" a zone being empty, because if it was
empty the TCC would be even more moot. I mean.. the zone is empty. If
a zone is empty the code is moot, if my character is there and would
like to get one item but can't due to the code the code is then just
irritating and play stopping. I really think that a thing should
accomplish more good than harm in order to be a worthy addition. All I
see from tcc is harm while I certainly saw no good from it in the
nearly always empty warrens before stonebrunt was recently added.
Stonebrunt even made the code more moot because the only creatures
with good drops are blue to a level 58 still and the only quest mobs
for an item good enough for someone that high are blue to at least a
55. 

Limiting is bad, add is good but this was 95 percent limit and only
about 5 percent add.
