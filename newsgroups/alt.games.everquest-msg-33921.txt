"Glares at you threateningly" is also KoS, for all practical
purposes.  If  you get that /con, they technically hate you
"less" than "scowling", but you still don't want to mess
with them.

The only difference is that with "glares", you can sometimes
get away with running past them quickly, whereas "scowls"
will be *instant* aggro if you get within range.  But
you can never count on them not aggroing even with "glares",
so just treat them as KoS and keep your distance.
