On a typical week, I'll put in somewhere about 20 hours of game play. I
am kind of stalling at the mid-50 area mostly due to the fact that I
tend to solo alot (and split my time between several characters). I'd
like to do LDoN adventures, but groups are kind of hard to come by.

When I started playing EQ, it was all very exciting, fun, new and
interesting. I would want to log on as much as I could (and probably
more than was good for me :)). Now it is still fun, but I have to grind
more and while I play alot, I can put it aside for from time to time.
