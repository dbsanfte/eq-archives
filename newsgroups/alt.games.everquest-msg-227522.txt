POJ zoneout should be good xp for you. Its just pretty heavily camped
these days. Without a slower, this would be the only POP zone you
could try probably. Another idea might be Veksar zone in and do the
goblins. You might even score a soulshard (Ear slot +4 AC +5 Dex +5
Wis +15 HP +25 Mana ALL/ALL). Its been a while since I hunted in
Dulak. I seem to remember them snaring pretty decently and they didnt
summon.
