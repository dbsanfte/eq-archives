I don't think they throw out data points.  I noticed that with a group of
57-61 the adventure was tougher than when one of the slots had a 54 cleric.
We missed it by one minute with the strong group and easily beat it when one
was replaced with the cleric.  Neither group had significant downtime.  We
were just able to kill them faster with the second group.
