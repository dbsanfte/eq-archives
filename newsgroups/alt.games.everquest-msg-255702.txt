See, this is sort of a weirdness.  As a warrior, when I have a multipull, 
the theoretical goal is for me to keep aggro on all of the mobs.  Doing 
that without switching targets at all is pretty dang near impossible.  At 
least, unless Furious is up, but that's only about once every 45 minutes.

But then, he had an enchanter (or bard) apparently, so that shouldn't have 
been that much of a concern.  Ideally, though, it'd be great if people 
could be relied on to have assist keys, so I could /gsay Assist me now!  
This one actually -is- the target! and get everyone on that one, then go 
back to maintaining aggro on the others.

Of course, the rest of that is bad.  /attack off, -then- switch to the 
mezzed mob and taunt/berate.

Well, theoretically, that's what you'd have to do in order to learn.  I 
remember my warrior having to learn that when she finally got big enough 
for it to be an issue at splitpaw spires.  And I'm sure all my enchanter 
experience in groups had given me very little idea how to actually pull 
for a group, as a warrior.

And here we see that he isn't a -real- warrior.

Really. If he wants to miss all the fun, make him. :)

Heh.  I wish my warrior could group with you.  My reply would be '40%? 
That's much too soon! I won't even be berzerk yet!'

We could play the whole 'how long can you keep me berzerk' game. :)
