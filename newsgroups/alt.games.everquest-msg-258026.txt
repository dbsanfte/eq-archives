Agreed, and it's more than just a lack of situational awareness; for most,
it's a failure at the man-machine interface level, not meshing well with the
automobile or the road. Not many things are scarier than the thought of a
bunch of jerky, panic-stricken cell-phone users piloting a ton of steel down
the highway at 60mph. What's really interesting is how regional the bad
habits can be . I lived in Boston for three years and I remember thinking
that everyone in that town drove like Parisian cab drivers circling the Arc
d'Triomphe. Seattle drivers are funny. If there's any chance that they will
have to get in the left lane five miles ahead, they'll start lining up NOW
and leave the right lane empty. I lived in California most of my life and at
the time thought they were the worst. But in retrospect, California drivers
are easily the best drivers around. I guess they have to be.
