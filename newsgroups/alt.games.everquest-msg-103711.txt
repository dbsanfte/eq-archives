Hi,

I�m just a newbie in this game and I think the problem is not only on your
side !

The manual just mention the first things you should do : hunting small
creatures and begging !!!

Even in the cities, a question to "old ones" isn�t successfull and you�re
shouted to shut up and go your own way ( my experiences ). I don�t think
that�s very funny for a new one, who doesn�t know what to to next :-(
I know, all of you where at this status, too. But I think it should be a
game to play together and not to exclude new ones !

That�s just my opinion

Greetings

Christian
