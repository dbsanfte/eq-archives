	Needs a new picture, now that I think of it; forgot to change it when I
dropped the Ice Forged Shackles for Tolan's.

	I have a 150 DEX under average circumstances (and that's from a 75 base).
If I'm in a situation that calls for Trueshot I will usually have Harness or
Focus, giving me 200+ DEX.  I haven't noticed that large of a difference
actually.  My top hits with a Huntsman, 6/150 arrows and Trueshot have stayed
around the 450 mark either way.
