It doesn't just "prefer" it. It will *only* go across flat terrain or
downhill, with downhill always being the preference.  Way back in the
day, when my wizzy was just a wee pup in his early teens, I was hunging
wisps and spiders out on the island at Erud's crossing.

If you are familiar with the island, there's an exctinct volcano crater
in the center. Very deep, very round, very steep walls.

Just to test out that theory (after reading about it on Graffe's) I went
down to the very bottom of it and start chain casting my Fade/SS spell
(whichever I had at the time, forget now.)  I never moved more than a
couple of inches around the tiny cup at the bottom of that crater. It
refused to take you uphill or through walls or other geography.

On the other hand, if you can arrange to usually be fighting up on a
goodly sized slope, it can be wonderful.  Quite often I would fight a
spider or wips well up the wall of the outside of the volcanic rim, and
cast that if the fight went south or I got multiple adds. It very often
threw me all the way out into the ocean, giving me time to get off a
gate before the mobs could catch up to me.
