Sounds like a pretty good idea, but wouldn't doing so have a negative impact
on my combat abilities?

That's actually something I've been trying.  My problem is that, since I've
been exploring on my own lately, when I get into combat I can't seem to fire
off any spells once the monster's engaged me.  Example:  I cast Strike to
get a monster's attention (let's say a goblin whelp).  The monster charges
me, and attacks.  Every time I try to cast a spell after that, my attempts
get interrupted by the monster's attacks.  Any pointers on how to get around
that?
