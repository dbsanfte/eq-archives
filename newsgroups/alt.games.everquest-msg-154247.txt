I'm on The Rathe,  and occasionally I see one particular individual trying
to charge something like 100,000pp for Iron Rations!

Incidentally, spider and spiderling silks go for up to 10pp on The Rathe. I
farm spiderling silks and sell them myself. But usually only for 3 to 4pp
each. (Can't stay on all day or all night with my trader up, or I would
charge more)
