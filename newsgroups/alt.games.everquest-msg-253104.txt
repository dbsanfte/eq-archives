Indeed, it would be almost impossible to learn to be a good bard with 
the buff window and bard songs off, you just can't learn how various 
songs interact in real use without this information flow.

Once you've got the timing more or less down, its possible to be a good 
bard without those crutches... but its possible like its possible to be 
a good pianist without being able to look at the sheet music or 
conductor; ok, Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder both managed it, very well, 
but its certainly a handicap.

To be a Great bard, I don't think you can do it without access to those 
information feeds, because individual computer and internet backbone 
variations mean that doing the exact same thing at two different times 
can take different amounts of real world time; a difference measured in 
milliseconds usually, but thats how tight you have to be if you're going 
to keep 7+ plates spinning in the air at the same time (singing 5 songs 
and switching in and out two instruments, or 4 songs and three 
instruments, would be minimum performance requirements for greatness 
IMO... not sufficient, mind you, as picking the Right songs and having 
the flexibility to also be flipping back and forth between targets 
and... well, greatness is pretty hard to pin down really.

At best, as a bard, I have moments of greatness, when everything 
crystalizes and I'm operating in "slow time" where this spinning 
cacophany all makes sense and I mysteriously seem to have the lesiure 
and the capacity to make sense of everything thats happening like 
watching a movie in slow motion.
