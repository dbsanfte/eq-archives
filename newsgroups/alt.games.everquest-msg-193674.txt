Bristlebane, but I'd have to delevel to show ya <g>. 

I certainly can't any more at 40th lvl, I think I did mention in a
previous post that there were blues out there I couldn't solo any
more, even with a fungi. Fungi really doesn't let you solo harder mobs
at his lvl, just lets you solo with basically no downtime if you have
the right camps. 

That soloing reds comment was meant ot compare him to my wizards and
in my teens the warrior definitely could solo reds with a lot less of
a 'fear factor' than the wizard.

I was doing reds this weekend in Kurns with the wizards. Mainly
because I had to clear out the occasional red that was interspersed
with the blue con skeletons.
