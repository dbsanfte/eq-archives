    Thanks! I've worked hard at getting the best possible things for my play
style and preferences, and with one exception (the Orb - low HPs, bah!) I've
done well at it. The Orb was a moment of weakness - our NToV raid was close
to done, I hadn't asked for anything yet, I was fairly new so I knew I had
to get an upgrade on that trip to get my gear up to snuff, and well, I
panicked and asked for the next CLR-usable thing that wasn't a downgrade.
Grats Delores on Orb!

> I really really want your primary and range items.

    The Primary item is within your grasp. Do you know the Scarlet Desert
zone-in to Grieg's End? Right near the zone-in, and I mean within one room
of it or so, is Praetorian Myral. We've killed him with less than two
groups, he isn't terribly hard - except in one case. He has an eight hour or
so spawn time, no PH, so you can farm him lots if you so desire. He has
three possible drops - Divine Hammer of Consternation (Dmg 40, Dly 35. Wt
3.00. +15 Str, +15 Wis, +100 HP, +100 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP Effect of
Divine Aura), my Wand (the rare drop), and the Scythe of Sundering (Dmg 13,
Dly 20. Wt 4.00. +15 Str, +15 Int, +80 HP, +80 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP
Effect of Flesh Rend.   Classes: Wr B Sk Ra N. Races: Hum Eru Def Gnm Iks).
You can see which he's holding - the Wand looks like a pitchfork or a music
stand. There's an named Alchemist mob which can be up nearby, which drops a
+5% Alchemy item and a 2HB which procs a knockback and looks like a broom,
so it usually isn't tough to entice some people into coming.

    Myral has big regen/HPs. Doesn't deal too much damage - I can tank him,
easy, even with the flurries. He procs his weapon, though - and there's the
problem. If he has the hammer, when he procs he becomes invulnerable but
keeps attacking. If you want to kill him with the hammer, you need to get a
strategy that doesn't let him hit you. Aggro kiting, or rooting and
peppering him with arrows, are two of the best methods. The fight isn't so
much dangerous as it is obnoxious, and if it sucks enough people won't want
to come back and help you clear him when he doesn't have the Wand.

    Ranged is NToV. If you're killing Ssra stuff, your guild can clear NToV.
The only question is if they want to go back and clear it.

    Bah, low HP stuff! ;-) My boots also have +10% to Channeling - Magelo
doesn't show a lot of the extra mods and abilities on a lot of items for
some reason. To list them: the neck has 10% mana savings on all non-CH
spells cast (essentially, Mana Preservation IV) and +5% to channeling, the
Ring of the Shissar has Enhancement Haste III, the Gauntlets have +15% to
Blacksmithing, the belt has Affliction Enhancement III, and as you know the
shield has a bonus to Dodge. I also have the Shears from Shei in one of my
packs - +15% Tailoring item.

    You have some very good gear for a cleric that hasn't exactly been a
hardcore raider since day one. Very much a MANA cleric, too. ;-)

> I also notice that, like me, you still have your Thurg legs.

    Cleric Velious quest leggings are mind-numbingly good. I can think of
only two sets of leggings I'd realistically prefer to these (realistic as
in, not counting Kael or Skyshrine), and both are from Vex Thal. Even the
new Ornate Plate Mold quest leggings from tier three planes aren't worth the
effort to get.

    Once you can make Heraldic armour, the world will be your oyster. The
stuff is damn-near required for serious raid tanks, and sells for a ton of
cash (not many human smiths around). You'll have enough cash to afford much,
much better, like one of those HoH girdles.

    /gasp!

    Last night we encountered an annoying mob that sucked tiny mobs into
itself and grew. After chain-CH'ing the main tank and propping him up, the
inevitable happened and I was summoned. This thing hits for close to 1000
damage, double? Triple? Bah, point is, it hurts. I got off DA when my health
was at the upright line in "D" in my name. No visible HPs. The shaman in my
group thought I'd died, until I told the group "glad I'm a HP cleric!" I was
able to self-heal when DA wore off, and get back in there until the mob
finally died. Had I been a MANA cleric, I would have bought the farm and
healed nobody.

    Mind you, the mob before that I did die. But he was quad 3500, rampage,
unslowable, and I was the unlucky sap picked to chain-CH, so I knew that was
going to happen. I even survived one round of attacks! =)

    Later on, you'll end up in chaotic ring events, and in areas with a lot
of adds, where people who can save you won't know you're dying until you hit
the floor. I see some of the other clerics in my guild without the big HPs,
and they get floored if a mob so much as looks at them. You'll really notice
the difference once you get to Vex Thal or in PoP, where stuff hits HARD. I
still remember the time when two trash mobs were pulled to camp in Vex
Thal - trash mobs that cast 1500 point targetted AoE spells. They both fired
at once, then one of them fired again. Dead casters and low-HP melees all
over the place - and there I was, quietly finishing the cast on my group CH
before starting to heal the MA. Built dwarf tough!
