Not that there is not some merit to what you say, but on the other
side of that coin is do you really think only honest people get to be
55+ ?    I've had a few occasions where I have led newbies to the
bank, had them hold an item while I changed my 'player', and in return
gave them a predetermined payment.  Perhaps I was just lucky, but
never got burned, and they always seem to be pretty happy to get the
money......part of the reasoning being that if he/she really is a
newbie, chances are they don't know what the worth is of what you are
passing anyhow, but everyone understands the value of cash.    I have,
however, gotten out of that habit, and simply leave everyone camped in
an out of the way, empty hut, and just lay stuff on the floor that I
wish to pass.  It's a gamble, but a pretty safe one.  IF I was going
to pass a very valuable item, I would do exactly what a previous
poster mentioned, use a friend, and only a friend that lived close
enough for me to drive over and smack him on the head if the exchange
went bad   :-)
