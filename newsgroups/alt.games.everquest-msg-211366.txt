I think it's time to upgrade my videocard.  I have a 64MB GEForce2
and it's served me well, but I get noticeable video sluggishness
in places like jaggedpine and the planes.

I don't want to spend the money on a Radeon 9800 or a GeForce FX
5800. Browsing through some recent issues of Maximum PC, it seems
that some good choices are a Radeon 9500, GeForce4 TI 4200, or
GeForce4 TI 4800.

Any suggestions?  Will one of these cards cure my ills?  My system
is an AMD Athlon XP 1800+ with 512MB RAM, if that makes a difference.

Thanks!
