Tankbob tells the group "incoming a greater skeleton".
[Function key select Tankbob]
/assist
/g Assisting %t

This is your second example, to which I was refering. After you type
/assist, the target is a greater skeleton; so when you say assisting %t, %t
is a greater skeleton and you tell the group that you are assisting a
greater skeleton.

What you want is:
/g Assisting %t
/assist

And now you tell the group that you are assisting Tankbob and then target a
greater skeleton.
