If they were making the white con mobs equal in power, everyone would be 
lvl 60 with 200+ AA, and would be hunting in ToV as an xp zone, some 
skilled people would probably solo there ~~ , if you want to take on 
tougher mob, you will need the help of some friends, no way you should 
do it solo (if a white mob was equal in power, you should be able to 
take him solo, because you have a brain). A white mob is equal in power 
to a bunch of players of the same level, not just one player.
