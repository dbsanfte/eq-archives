You can also drag your body while running by making a hot key with  /corpse
and clicking it as you run.

Bandaging works based on your skill.  The number of hitpoints you heal with
each bandage is your skill divided by 4.  So when your skill is very low you
won't see much change at all.  You can't bandage past 50% until you reach a
certain level and then you are permitted to bandage up to 75%
