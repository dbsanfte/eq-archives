Unfortunately, at this point there does not seem to be any other
alternatives, I would love for this to all be resolved without violence,
but it does not seem that that is going to happen.

Now my only problem is this: we are force fed, by the media, that the
reason we are ready to pounce on Iraq is because they have weapons of mass
destrution.  While I believe that be to true, you never know what other
agenda the government may have, what other reasons they may have to nudge
this war along, to MAKE it happen.  The moment we started getting involved
with Iraq again, I think most of America knew it was going to come down to
war.  Little George is finishing Big Georges war, hell I think we knew
that was coming once he got elected.
