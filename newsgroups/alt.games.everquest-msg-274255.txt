My hard drive croaked, so I bought a new one and had to start over
from scratch.  I installed from the original 1999 CD and when I ran the
game the first time, I was a bit suprised to find that the patcher
simply wouldn't work.  I thought it would at least be able to download
an updated patcher and proceed from there.

I was able to get an updated patcher from the web, but I thought it was
interesting to note that if your only resource is an original CD, you
cannot play the game.
