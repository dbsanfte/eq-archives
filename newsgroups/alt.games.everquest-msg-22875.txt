Actually they are called "Care Bear" servers because everyone is
so awefully nice to one another! Trolls and halflings walk around
holding hands! High Elves and Dark Elves have tea with one
another.

And every once in a while you can catch a glimpse of the
Wood Elves "goosing" dwarves! It's so pretty and happy
that everyone gets along! I also don't think it rains there.
Blue skies everyday with big bright rainbows!

CARE BEARS STARE!

p.s. Never liked Quake and Unreal was boring. Heck, I hardly PK!
      It adds a new view to game as well as a great challenge.
