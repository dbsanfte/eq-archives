Very true!

As a guild officer, what I'm looking for when recruiting is as much being
confident that they know what they are getting as that I know what my guild
is getting. I want who I recruit to stay a long time and be happy. Very few
things are as frustrating as recruiting someone, and having them disband
from the guild a week or two later.

As for your role in the raid, that may change every single raid you're in. I
run a Bard, who is the consumate "fill in the gaps" toon. What I need to do
varies =extremely= widely based on what other classes/levels are in the raid
or group. My role may even change if I have two different bards of the same
levels between different groups. Different players focus their toons in
different ways, and so I role some with that they are doing and fill in the
blanks on what they are not doing.

As said though - just have fun. If you are having =fun=, then you will
likely be doing things right. Most people that are whining/stealing, etc.,
etc., etc. aren't really haven't that much fun when it comes down to it
(they are too busy feeling cheated themselves or some other weird thing).
