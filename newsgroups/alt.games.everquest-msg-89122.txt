Doubtfull.  The wakazashi just isn't fast enough.  Nor is the Katana,
considering that it's shape was developed for Iado-style techniques.  Also,
I don't recall there being bronze Katanas.  The earliest were basically
welded, and the classic ones were forged from steel and tempered differently
on different portions of the blade.  During Europe's bronze age, the Bushi
were using mainly spears.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
