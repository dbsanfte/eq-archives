Well, 250 mana (I'm sure not giving up my Mask of War for a
better mana rate on a DoT), and, yes, DoTs are good on mobs
that last long enough to make it useful, as long as they
also don't do enough damage while they're alive to make
the mana *healing* necessary.  I'm sure your dead tank would
be happy to know that the pet was doing well...

But, back to the point:  a shaman pet is just as good and
the shaman has Slow as well which makes the healing not an
issue.  Not to mention the chance of a JBB.  So, bonus to
the shaman with a 50% heal.  And a 54 druid probably has
better mana-free DoTs as well, or at least a more powerful
DoT at a comparable cost.  So, bonus to the druid with a
75% heal as well.

So my point stands: clerics STILL need something to make
them viable group members between at 54 and 55, before
they get the chance for melee damage, in exchange for the
increased *XP group-capable* heals on test.  The reduced
mana cost on UHoF just isn't enough.

They want to make things balanced?  Great:  give clerics
the summoned hammer at 54 and change the effect on it from
a combat proc to a click-able DD like the JBB, but 75% as
efficient...
