There was a 44 cleric . I dont think he died. Was powerleveling and working
with ranger ? Sorrow something iirc.
The ranger was in mid 20's. Killing lvl 6 to one 34 magi for sure. 2 boxer I
assume.

The rampant cheats kinda took the fun out of it. They caught lots though. I
remember 2 well know cheats that could pop from zone to any zone somehow.
Poof suddenly gone and never seen again. Barbs 30's I think.
