Hmm pray tell what limited use beyond mana-battery or DMF bitch?  
FD/Harmshield pulling?  Eater of the DT?  Some of the new SoL spells for
upper end necs are more toys really than Amazingly nifty useful (Mind Wrack
comes immediately to mind there) the 28AC DoT thing is kinda nice tho but
that's single group.  Until I get Funeral Pyre my dmg output as a 60 Nec 
isn't gonna be up to snuff until I get say DireCharm, Lifeburn really
seems to be a good way to get ganked but I could be wrong on that.
