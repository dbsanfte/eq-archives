Being an impartial part in the subject matter, and after seeing the
discussion thus far, I'd have to go with the "not yet" stance.  Those who
are passionate that it SHOULD be done are free to make it happen
themselves, of course.

If this community decides later on to split, I may or may not be the one
to handle it then, depending on whether I'm playing EQ2, or visiting AGE,
at that time (I've taken month-long absences from this group in the past
half-year, so anything is possible).

The only fly in this ointment, like I mentioned earlier, is that I did
post the proposal for critique, and there IS a NG hijacker on
alt.config...so if you see an alt.games.everquest2 pop up it might be some
random 3rd party causing trouble.

Kind of a bummer...I was looking forward to starting a NG just so I could
say that I did. :P
