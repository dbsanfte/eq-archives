Fair enough, however this started out as question of how many raiders to 
casuals. Counting a raider with 3 accounts as 3 raiders is obviously out 
to lunch.

However, yeah, from Sony's point of view, where they count accounts not 
players that sort of tally makes sense. 

But lets review the numbers:

Lets for no good reason assume your estimate of 1250 active raiding 
players (who don't spend a significant (read as "overwhelming majority") 
of their online time in 1-group content) is off by 100% and double it, 
and then give them each 2 accounts, times 25 servers and call it 'active 
raiders'.

1250 x2 x2 x25= 125000 active raiders.

Now we can take that 450,000 toal accounts, and knock a quarter off it 
call it it 'inactive':

450000 x0.75 = 337500 active accounts

Subtract the two:

337500 active accounts - 125000 active raiders =

212500 active non raiding accounts.

1.7:1 (or for every 10 raiders there are 17 non-raiders)

This is pretty much a best case count for you. I don't really agree with 
your 1/4 inactive figure, but ran with it. And while I agree that giving 
you a 2nd box for each raider is fair, I feel there is no legitimate 
justification to DOUBLE your estimate of active raiding accounts. I'd 
agree that some extra allowance should be factored in, but 100% is 
unjustifiable. Finally, underpopulated servers like Test, are being 
counted as having a full complement of 5000 active raider accounts, 
which is absurd.

In my eyes I've clearly over counted active raider accounts. I 
personally beleive that the ratio is at least 2:1 (raiders making at 
most 1/3rd the active playerbase.)

(You'll note I ignored 'inactive' raider accounts. Inactive accounts 
weren't counted for either side.)

If you wish to continue to beleive that raider accounts make up the 
majority of the total, we must agree to disagree. I personally can't 
even fathom a 1:1 ratio, nevermind something actually in the raiders 
favor. 1.7:1 (17:10) is the best we came up with, and I don't find it 
particularly credible.

And as a final aside, this tally above represents accounts not people. 
If we're counting actual people then the number of raiders above is 
effectively halved. Statements like "the needs of the many outweigh the 
needs of the few rings" particularly hollow when one group gets counted 
twice. 

Sure SOE is counting accounts, and I don't begrudge them that policy, 
its a business after all. But lets not try and justify it with 
platitudes that assume everyone is equal to have any meaning. Of course, 
it doesn't REALLY matter, because I'm satisfied that even counting each 
raider four times over isn't enough to give them even close to a 
majority.

I was being more discerning. :) I was just looking at those whom I knew 
had left the game, and knew whether they still paid. I have a lot of RL 
friends who play or played EQ, and of the group in the not-playing 
category none of them still pay, even of those who had prepaid accounts 
and left for WoW... they've all lapsed by now.

I'm sure there are abandoned for WoW but not lapsed accounts... it 
hasn't been a year yet after all. And I'm sure a trickle continues to 
abandon and let lapse, but its a trickle not 25%. The group that's on 
leave in military service/car accidents/illness/extended vacation is 
real, but it's not terribly large. One in 20 maybe, if that.

While I dropped out of the raid game before it got to its modern degree 
of 'creative' its not like I put my head under a rock and pay no 
attention to it. I do have a few RL raider friends; I raid vicariously 
now. :)
