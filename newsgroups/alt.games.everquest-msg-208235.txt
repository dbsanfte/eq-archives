I may owe Lance and Pal a bit of an apology.  I think I've figured out where
the discrepancy in our viewpoints is coming from.

Palindrome - what robe do you wear?  Lance - what are on your wrists?  I'm
betting they're a far cry from the Observer robe I wore until my early 40s,
or the gold jade bracelets I had, or the Stein of Moggok and Water Crystal
Staff I used.  Your melees are not wearing banded and swinging Combine
Longswords; they're wearing droppable gear from Velious or Luclin and
swinging Centis and Lamentations.  Please note that I wasn't in bad gear for
my time; on the contrary, I was getting twinked by a pair of highly uber
players - Ari and Zenko were in their mid fifties!

I'm willing to bet your enchanters have AC and HP similar to those of the
ranger and warrior I leveled up with - getting smacked around by blues,
whites and yellows is no real problem so long as there's a healer in the
area.  Why should you be worried about getting aggro, if the melee is going
to have it dead in a few swings?  You can tank this stuff for twenty or
thirty seconds, if need be.  Sure, you'll have to get healed later, but no
big deal.

Am I on the right track?  Is that what you guys are working with?  If so, I
can completely understand why you think I'm an old fuddy-duddy with no clue
what the game is like at your level - and you're right, I'm totally removed
from that.

But there's one line above that I'll quote and implore you to consider
carefully.

"> >At higher levels, tactics that were a joke in the low levels become

When will you learn those tactics?  I learned them painfully, with many
deaths.  With your gear and buffs from higher level toons, you can learn
them now, cheaply - or you can learn them in your fifties, with no room for
error, and watch groups or raids wipe as you learn them.  Learn when to slow
without getting aggro NOW.  Learn how to get a mob off the healer without
getting hit NOW.  Learn those skills you'll need for Chardok raids and Hate
raids and Hedge Maze and Xanamech before you find yourself doing those
events.

Because when you get to those levels, you'll find yourself in the position I
was in when I was in the 20s and 30s, when getting aggro meant getting dead,
when taking an extra half-second to get a mob mezzed meant losing the healer
and possible group wipe.  Use the 3rd party camera views, and make a hotkey
to assist the MA (so you know what NOT to mezz), and haste your pet so you
get a message when it wears off and learn the timing of your buffs.

In other words... prep now, so you won't suck later.
