Just to further show these type of people (the hypocrites who are against
something then do it themselves). Discovery Channel recently (within the
past month or two) had a few shows (part 1 first night, 2 & 3 second night)
about the history of gambling. In one part they interviewed who used to be
considered a very big anti-gambling activist. One week the lady had a big
anti-gambling protest, some (short) time later she was being arrested for
stabbing her husband 75+ times (before he finally died) because he refused
to give her any more money to gamble with.
