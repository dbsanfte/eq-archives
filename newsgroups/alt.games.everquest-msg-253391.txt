WOW!  LOL  I humbly eat my hat...  I honestly and truly was under the
impression (for over 3 years now) that you could not drag your own corpse...  I
had been told that long ago and therefore have never tried it.  

I sincerely apologize to the person who suggested this idea for claiming they
were mistaken.  In fact you DO learn something new every day...  :D

From now on I vow to get my facts at least semi in order before posting a
reply... hehe

Thanks for the info all of you!  :)
