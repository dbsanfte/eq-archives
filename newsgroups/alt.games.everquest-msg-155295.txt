Shit!  I usually pay clerics 100pp per rez now.  If I'd known the charges on
these sticks were that cheap, I'd have seen what I could do to get 2 of them
myself.  Of course, I'd be sad at the developments today's patch brings in
that case.

Hopefully they'll change Vox's loot table in a hurry.  Put the staff in
Western Wastes and let the stronger guilds farm them.  Of course, the weaker
guilds lose out on having a staff drop then, but under the circumstances, I
think it's the lesser of 2 evils.
