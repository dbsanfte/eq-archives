No at all.  Truth is truth whether its written down in code on a remote 
beach just before the next wave hits, or whether its written in english 
in permanent marker on the relevant person's video monitor.

Doesn't matter WHERE I say something, its true or its not true on its 
own merits.

Because truth isn't relative.  Its true, or its not.  I'm right, or I'm not.

AH, I don't agree that my venting will achieve nothing.  Its working 
very nicely at what I'm trying to achieve with it... I'm releasing 
pressure.  Thats what venting is for, not for doing work, but for 
releasing pressure so the system doesn't explode.

Perhaps something will get done about it after all, heck, as far as I 
can see -something- is getting done, that forum you pointed me at is now 
being updated every half hour... with the information that the servers 
won't be up for another half hour.  Much better than the previous state 
of affairs, where the guess was posted and then just left to turn out on 
target or not, with no updates.  What I'm looking for though is the post 
which says They Are Up NOW.

And that still wouldn't address the core problem I'm complaining about 
which is that the information is being posted over by the coffee pots 
while either no information, incomplete information, or outdated 
information is being broadcast over the company PA system where you'd 
expect the information to be.

That would not make what I'm saying less true.  Truth remains truth, 
regardless of whether I check to see if its still true or not.  By 
checking, I at least have the chance of being pleasantly surprised by 
improvements.  E.G. the improved posting in the Forum section.

You do?  HOW?  You don't.  You don't know the difference between 
patching complete but testing going on, and servers open but  you can't 
log in due to congestion.  Unless you've got a source I'm still not 
familiar with.

The information is something that people at SOE have access to, and 
could share, but thus far, I've never seen them share it.  Perhaps today 
  will be the first time.

I'm not holding my breath (I'm using an EB item)
