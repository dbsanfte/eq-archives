Someone recently coded a program like EQW that was working pre-Luclin and 
although it wasn't his intention, it was actually working where you could 
play 2 accounts at the same time on the same computer.  I don't know the 
name of it or the current status, but you can find out about it at 
HackersQuest.

I got a good laugh reading the posts there by the idiots who decided to 
cheat in various ways.  The most prevalent seemed to be tripping a flag ( 
via a trainer-type prog, I assume ) that let you run at SoW+ speed.  
Apparently Verant caught on to it and was able to catch it when you zoned 
or something.  Reading posts from the idiots there who did this was 
quite.... pleasing.
