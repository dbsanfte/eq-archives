I have to agree with most of what you say.  Someone can play a bard as their
first character, but they really really need to do some research.  A bard
isn't very useful to a group if they don't have or even worse know their
songs.  I'm still not sure how he got to 35 or 36 without know what songs he
needed to be useful in a group.  I've played 2 bards now, had my first to 49
when I figured out I didn't make him quite right(IMO), put to many points in
CHR to start and he was a human.  Anyway now I have my new bard to 36 and
having a blast.  My first character what a shaman and my second a druid.
The druid is 60 but I scraped the shaman.  I plan on taking the bard to 60
and he will be my main.  Bard are just way more fun to play for me and I
have tried just about all classes.
