I'm currently L19 Crusader.  I got that task as soon as I hit 19 (Monday).
I asked my guild and was told to go find Gnoll Battlers.  They can be found
wandering between assorted gnoll camps.  They're green solo.

To do the job easily, come out the N Qeynos gate, follow the road all the
way to the bridge.  Come back from the bridge about 200 yards to the curve
in the road.  There's a tree beside the road on the north and a small gully
on the south.  You'll see across the gully a group of 3, 2 brawlers and a
runecaster, all green.  Off to the SW you'll just be able to see another
group of 3, all blue.  North side of the road to the NW there's a hill with
a tent on top.

If you wander back and forth between that tent (only one gnoll actually
spawns there, and he's a solo) and say about half-way between the tree and
the bridge, you'll run across solo brawlers about once every 2 minutes.  I
got my 25 kills in a bit over an hour, as best I recall.

It's slower if there's a group hunting gnolls there, of course, but it does
get the job done.  My best bit of amusement was with my last gnoll.  A
caster (elementalist) showed up and fired just as I ran up to one gnoll.
Fine, it happens.  I went and got another, my 24th.  Then I go running off
to number 25.  I'm almost there, when it suddenly switches over to engaged
and goes running past me to the caster.  Annoying.  All of a sudden, another
solo brawler spawns almost on top of the caster.  Now he's got one on his
pet and one on him  I wander off to the side to watch.  His pet doesn't last
long.  Now he's got both on him, and he's running.  Straight to me.  He
loops around a couple of times, then high-tails it towards Qeynos.  He gets
beyond them and they disengage.  The one I was originally after 'ports back
to it's spawn point, where I kill it (number 25).  I run across the other
one walking back to it's point and kill it (number 26, superfluous).  About
that time I get a sarcastic thanks from him for not helping.  I respond (in
/ooc) that because he never yelled for help, I couldn't help.  I didn't
bother explaining that I wouldn't have helped anyway.

(Yes, I am a Paladin, and yes, I do and should help others.  But that
doesn't mean that I'm a pushover, either.  Don't expect to take away my mob
and then also expect me to rescue you from that same mob when things don't
go your way.)
