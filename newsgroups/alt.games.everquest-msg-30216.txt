Not quite that simple. You can't just use a regular hub alone. You
need a hub that acts as a 'router' too. (I quote 'router' because it's
not really a router, it's a network address translation box; you can
find 'em for around $150.) Pros: simple, plug-it-in-it-usually-works
setup. Cons: Costs money, you don't have as much control over the
configuration of the NAT or firewall (if it includes firewall
functions).

Option two is to add another network card to your main computer and
enable Internet Connection Sharing, if you're machine is running a
version of Windows that supports it. Pros: Included in all recent
versions of Windows (98SE and up at least), works well with Everquest.
Cons: gotta crack open your main machine to add another network card.

The third, and in my opinion the best, is to dig that old 486 or
Pentium out of the closet, put two network cards in it, install Linux,
and set up your own firewall and NAT box. Pros: HIGHLY configurable,
includes secure firewall (if you set it up correctly), works extremely
well with Everquest and many other games, and it's free or nearly free
depending on the stuff you have around. Cons: takes time and effort to
learn how to set it up. Only geeks or the very curious need try. You
can get a basic NAT/firewall setup running in a few hours, I'd bet.
