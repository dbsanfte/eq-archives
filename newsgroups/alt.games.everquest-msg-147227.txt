Well you were initially responding to me, so I will make sure you
understand when I said experience would be different in a raid group,
the logical course would be that it would overall give *less*
experience than if a single group had killed the mobs. So 'multiplier'
is sort of the wrong word.

6 people kill a sarnak worth 1200 xp - each person gets 200 xp
12 people in a raid group kill same sarnak, suffer 50% raid experience
modifier, each person only gets 50 xp

But it would be worth it for raids like Chardok, any of the planes,
E/WToV etc.
