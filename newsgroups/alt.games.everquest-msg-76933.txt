Hi Shane:

Thanks for the link to the file, it took me several attemps to download it,
but I got there in the end, and yes, that's just what I wanted, so many
thanks! As for the spellbook, yes, again I'd find that very useful too, so
when you have the time, and feel so inclined I'd be very grateful.

Many thanks ...

Stevie.
