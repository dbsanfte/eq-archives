Even with all the nice responses you got about your encounter with the rude
bard, I'm completely shocked that nobody pointed out that you shouldn't *ever*
be blowing off AoE's in BlackBurrow.  That's not how you finish off trains.
It's how you start new ones in that hole.  Even if you are of a level where you
can wipe the train out yourself with no danger, at the very least you just
likely drew a bunch of mobs up from down below who other people who could get
xp for them would have liked to take down.  Don't take that as a "screw you,
asshole" kind of post. Just some hopefully helpful advice I was given back when
I was playing in there.  It's great to go in there and help the newbies, but it
seems like rooting/nuking some of them off the endangered lowbies would be more
productive to your goal of helping than casting a bunch of AoE's in a
multilevel dungeon.
