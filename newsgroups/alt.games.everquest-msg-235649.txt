From the shadows, the mysterious ajs@ajs.com (Aaron Sherman) (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

The only possible solution that would have satisfied you would have
been a global rollback.

I can tell you if my guild got rolled back out of our long awaited RZ
kill just so a bunch of whiners could get some plat back using a
broken system everyone and their dog knew was going to get nerfed I
would have hunted you down and fed you to the fishies myself.

At the moment GoD appears to be turning out to be a collosal disaster
anyways.
