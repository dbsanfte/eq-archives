No, it is not.   Well, sort of.  The class penalties were removed (in a very
funky way).   Only the racial penalties remain.

For class penalties though... it's still true that certain classes like
rangers need 20% more exp to level.   But they get 20% more exp from every
kill to balance it out.

Back when this table was really true though... the situation was even more
fucked up than that.   Not only did the classes have experience penalties,
some very hefty penalties, those penalties were then shared with the rest of
the group.  Everyone in a specific group would level at the same rate... but
two groups could have vastly different rates from each other.   If group 1
with a warrior, 2 rogues and a cleric needed 100 kills to level...  group 2,
with a paladin, 2 rangers and a cleric would need 160 kills of the same mobs.
Just because of the class penalties.    As you could imagine, hybrids were
kind of fucked back then when it came to getting a pickup group.  Since they
were not 20% better killers / tankers, to make up for the 20% exp penalty from
adding them.

"We need a new Mario game, where you rescue the princess in the first ten
minutes, and for the rest of the game you try and push down that sick feeling
in your stomach that she's "damaged goods"... When Peach asks you, in the
quiet of her mushroom castle bedroom "do you still love me?" you pretend to be
asleep. You press the A button rhythmically, to control your breath, keep it
even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
