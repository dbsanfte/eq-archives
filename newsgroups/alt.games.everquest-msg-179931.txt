Well, you were blessed that God gave you such warning, since obviously, He
finds value in you, however, what makes you think there is plenty of time
left? I think you had better HURRY, for the fact is, there is NOT much time
left.

How do you KNOW you are saved, since salvation only comes to those who are
JUDGED and FOUND WORTHY, righteous, holy, pure, sinless, and obedient to be
given that crown, which isn't given until after the great tribulation?


Matt 10:22
22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth
to the end shall be saved.
(KJV)


Matt 7:21-23
21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
heaven.
22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in
thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many
wonderful works?
23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye
that work iniquity.
(KJV)


1 Pet 4:17-19
17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if
it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel
of God?
18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the
sinner appear?
19 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the
keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
(KJV)

You get the feeling that most people won't end  up in hell, then you
shouldn't believe your feelings.



Matt 7:13-14
13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the
way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto
life, and few there be that find it.
(KJV)
