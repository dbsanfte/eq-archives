Except Wargames. Wargames are all about using tactics, terrain and
knowledge of equipment to achieve superiority even when outnumbered.

This was the result of Political factors. If the game engine models
Political factors then that would be a loss, because the player (the
US int this case) didn't take them into account. If the game engine
does not model political factors then the player is free to ignore the
clamoring against the loss of American lives and the political
squabble and instead focus on using all the units of war to win. 

>wars with ambiguous outcomes (example: World War I, Korea), or wars in which

Neither of those were ambiguous. WWI had losers and winners. Korea had
the successful repulsion of an invasion and has held the line for 50
years. The protected south has become an economic giant whose economy
is tied intimately to both the US and Japan.

That is a possibility and is modeled in some wargames. As the WOPR
said: The only way to win is not to play. But that's also part of the
game. To win without getting to a place where the end game is total
destruction.

How is it a problem if it applies equally to everyone? And if everyone
has the same chance to use those abilities?
