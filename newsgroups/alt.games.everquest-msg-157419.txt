Suddenly the rules have been changed.  Not to say that a monk had an
advantage over some other class before but, after playing a game for a
few years, the rules have been changed.  I wonder what this would do
to chess?  What you mean my queen can only move 3 spaces?  Well,
she was a lot more powerful than any other piece on the board...
A lot of time and effort has been invested by many players.  It hurts
when that is thrashed.  Each player can play each class. So where is
the un-fair?  
  
All nerfs are un-fair.
