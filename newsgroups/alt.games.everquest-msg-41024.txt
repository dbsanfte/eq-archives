Greetings,
   I am looking for some advice.  I recently reached lvl 37 with my 
Ranger and am starting to review what equipment I have and what I would 
like to get in the future.  Unfortunately, I am somewhat at a loss as to 
what to get.  I am still using some banded pieces but some of my armour 
is barely better than banded.  I keep telling myself to get some Ivy 
Etched Armour, but there is a little Necro by the name of Meldrath that 
I can't take solo (or with any group that I can currently get together), 
that is standing between me and my Ivy Etched tunic (the other pieces 
are mostly doable but I just have to take the time to do the quests).

   I have @1000 plat in the bank, but since I very frugal by nature I 
would prefer to quest/hunt for any upgrades.
