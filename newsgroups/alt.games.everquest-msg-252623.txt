I believe you would be mistaken there.  Some rocks are not worthless and
just because you claim it to be worthless is not going to persuade a court
to let you keep it for free.  They also would not accept your claim that
"its only worth a quarter if that".  Maybe it had sentimental value to him
and he would not have sold it for anything less.  Then that is his right,
and not yours to trick him into handing it over for free.  You made the deal
for $1k and if they allow anything it will be for you to back out of the
deal and return what you took. And seriously, I dont believe they would even
allow that unless the court believed that you thought it was a joke
transaction.  A possibility in the case of the pebble, but not likely in the
case of the plats.  But in any case, if you decide to keep the pebble or the
plats then the court will tell you to Pay the Man.
