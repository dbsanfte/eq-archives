Apparently Verant learned nothing from the Luclin fiasco, because the patch
server is again severely overloaded, making it impossible to download the
latest patch containing the new user interface.  I have now spent 14 hours
trying to get a complete download.  At first, I couldn't even get the
patcher to spawn.  The little "connecting." pop-up would just sit there
until it eventually timed-out.  Then, when the patcher finally loaded, it
would give me a blank stare for a while (little or no network activity) and
finally puke with a page fault.  Finally, I got to the point where it would
start downloading files, although the process was unimaginably slow.  The
file downloads would invariably time-out and I would have to press the
[download] button to resume the process.

All I can say at this point is, "I'm fed-up".  I'm fed-up with Verant's lack
of concern and appreciation for their customer base  -- in a word,
arrogance.  I'm fed-up with the draconian use of operant conditioning
techniques, such as, variable reinforcement (notice how good loot drops on a
rare and random basis?) to get people addicted to the game.  I'm fed-up with
money-making scams like paying for a name change.  I'm fed-up with camping
MOBs for hour upon hour to eventually get some piece of armor that's
considered worthy only for someone 15 levels below where I currently am.  I'
m fed-up with lag and random disconnections.  And I'm fed-up with the mass
of illiterate morons, loot whores, and guild pussies that make-up most of
the PC population.

I'm going to reflect on this current situation, do some research on other
games (such as, AO, DAoC, etc.) and decide if I want to continue this two to
three year investment in EQ.  In the meantime, I'm going to read a book.
