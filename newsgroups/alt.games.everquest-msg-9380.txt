I've never played a shadow knight, so this question isn't too dumb, but...

Can SKs do any healing like a paladin? Or cast any kind of damage shield?

My druid got a tremendous amout of nice faction in HPH just by casting damage
shields and healing folks who were hunting gnolls and orcs. I was not in any way
stealing kills or experience and I got the same faction adjustments as if I were
actively bloodying my weapon. I always asked when I "joined" the group ("Does
anyone mind me healing and casting damage shields while you fight? I'm working
on faction") and NEVER had anyone say no (as if anyone would object!)
