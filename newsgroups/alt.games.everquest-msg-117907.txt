Correction. An *uber* ranger with a *LOT* of AA skills, can in *some* cases
easily outdamage other classes.

Your talking about maybe 2% of the ranger population across the board..
sorry but that doesn't cut much with me.

I'll get a rogue guildie friend to parse his damage sometime,  he has AA
skills in critical hits, ambidexterity, and chaotic stab, including tunares
piercer/primal.  I mean lets at least try to get the comparisons fair.

Or the ranger can't get a clear LoS, the ranger can't move to find a LoS.
If the mob has as much as a toe anywhere near the wall, nothing range
attacked is going to do damage.

Rangers *CAN* do a lot of damage, but to say average_60_ranger with 0 aa
levels can and will easily outdamage average_60_monk and average_60_rogue at
will with 0 aa levels, just isn't realistic IMO.
