"u" and "r" kinda boggle me. In both cases, the other two letters are
both within 3 keys' distance of the one letter it's reduced to. "u"
especially, because all the letters are even on the same row. Even so,
it's TWO FREAKING LETTERS! Even for a slow typer, that's one second
saved, tops.... I can understand "reasonable" shortenings, but when
you're cutting less than 5 letters, all I can say is....why?

"plz" bugs me. If they wouldn't swap the s for a z, it wouldn't be as
much of a problem. "pls" would still bug me, but not nearly as much.
In fact, any time someone swaps an s for a z in a word ("grinz", etc),
I want to smack them. Same goes for "kewl" instead of "cool". Or
"dood" instead of "dude" (let's not even get into "d00d").

Do these people not know that they're the only ones who thinks that
typing style looks "kewl"? Everyone else is either laughing at them or
wanting to strangle them... :p
