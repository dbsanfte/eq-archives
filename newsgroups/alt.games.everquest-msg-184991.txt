At 60, I was doing nothing but PoN, PoI, PoD for xp, because nothing else 
came close.  At 61, I am still there, although I did make a few visits 
elsewhere.  Sebilis Golems are dark blue, and easy to solo, there are 3 on 
the way to the zoneout.  Fungus Grove has lots of blue mobs, including many 
of the small mushrooms, which are easy to single pull at level 61.
