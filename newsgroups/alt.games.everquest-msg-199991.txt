It might if you have been playing since 1998, but I started in 2003 and
it doesn't so far. There is stacks/plenty to do in the game (www
searching helps you find a lot), so I am enjoying the game in itself. 

Even with no sound and very basic graphics. Probably because I'm not
stuck on "images", but the logical puzzles of the game, but I still
think Coloassal Cave (or whatever your version was called) was a good
game (Hmm, just where are my maps of the maze, etc {:-).

It is the continual suck of money and time requirements from RL to
achieve advancement that worry me. Even though it is only $AUS23/month,
I can not help but wonder whether my $276pa for games sub + $1,000 pa.
for hardware upgrades needed to play the game better might not be better
spent (/sigh, shades of having too many interests).
