Taunt will put the tank at the top of the hate list.  But hate isn't
the only thing that goes into a mob's agro choice:  proximity and
whether or not a potential target is sitting are modifiers.  For some
mobs sitting is huge, if you're on the hate list and you sit you are
in for some monster love posthaste.  For most it's a big deal, don't
sit right after casting a high agro spell or the tank's proximity
might not be enough.  For some lowbie mobs it doesn't matter a whole
lot, you can sit right on top of them once the tank's got some hate
built up.  In your case, you'd probably have been ok if you stood
when the tank went to taunt and break the mez and waited to sit again
until he hit it a couple times.  Remember that hate "decays" over
time, just waiting a few seconds while somebody else builds hate and
the hate the mob has for you fades a bit makes a huge difference.
