So often people say what they hate about it, but obviously it has alot of
good qualities.  What do you like the most?

Here are some of mine:
Watching casters and the graphical effects that go with it
Getting new armor/weapon and seeing how it looks on you
Grouping with fun people who keep the conversation lively (and of course
play well)
Checking out new zones and seeing the mobs and landscape
The anticipation of getting to that next level with all the cool spells or
abilities
Finding that rare drop on a mob
