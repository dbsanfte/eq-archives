    Wow, then something's wrong there. Upper Guk spiders alone should yield
an average of a half stack of swatches per 16 minute spawn cycle, and that's
not counting the Lower Guk widows which you could also be harvesting at your
level. And that's assuming you don't have free reign over an outdoor zone
like East Karana where if your kill rate is sufficient you can beat that
harvest rate. Expected skill-up rate for someone with 200 plus INT or WIS
and above 185 DEX (both of which I'm sure you can get) is at lowest 3 per 20
combines across the entire 131 to 158 range. Three-swatch Wu's starts at
151 - so 151 to 158 is about 47 combines, or 141 swatches. Since I can't
remember when two-swatch Wu's started, I'll assume every piece in 131-151 is
two swatch - that means another 260 swatches, or 400 total. I'll assume
gathering in Lower (either in person, or paying the people there for silks)
reduces the effective spawn time in upper to 15 minutes. That means 40
swatches per hour, or ten hours total as an upper limit. This meshes well
with the total time it took my cleric to go from 131 to 158 - and she was
not at 200 WIS, nor 185 DEX, nor did she have access to Lower Guk silks.

    What I found was a pain was those damned mana vials. Glad I have a baby
ENCH to make them with, but boy do those eat time. You can usually speed up
your silk harvest rate by buying from others, but I found most enchanters
would rather walk across broken glass with bare feet than sit around making
those things.

    James
