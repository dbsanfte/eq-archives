That simplifies him way too much.  He cared for one thing only, and that was
his people.  I tend to think that's a good trait for a King.  The problem
is, that left him a bit short sighted.  Combine that short sighedness with
the fact that he didn't really have faith in The Plan (TM), and you can see
why he was so weak towards the ring.  Personally, I thought he was one of
the most interesting characters.  He was all too human, with everthing good
and bad that that brings.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
