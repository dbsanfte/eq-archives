The GM's told me the same thing on Povar when I camped a character and kept
/con ing the corpse with a character on my other account.  I camped the
first one out completely the "slow way" and the rez timer kept on counting
down for an hour and twenty minutes.

Funny thing is, that when I logged back in the next day, the rez timer on my
corpse said that I had an insane amount of time left (well over 10,000
minutes IIRC).
