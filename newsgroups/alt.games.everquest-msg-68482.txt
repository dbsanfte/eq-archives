I WOULD agree with that but my brother bought 2 dell systems about a year
ago and had the service plan that if they went down then someone comes to
fix it. Well he had to wait almost 9 months before they finally told him to
send them in. Then they trie to keep them for breach of contract (he was
leasing them i think)... I dun like DELL. Now i build them for him. =-)
