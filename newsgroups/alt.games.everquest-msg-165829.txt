There is no way to sell an account, either, yet you said the brother sold
his account.

That's nice.  That's also not the situation described in your original post.
The situation there is person A and B sharing account A, owned by A.  Person
C wants to start a new account for B, and transfer B's character.  This
would be in effect solvable by having person A actually buy the new account,
transfer B's characters to it, and then give the account to B.
