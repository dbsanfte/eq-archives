No. Anymore I only really consider one single spawn a "camp", verant
does not even consider that (saying you have to "share", if brought
into the fray) I would say players have to share camps like dervishes
also.

So don't let them if you want to do the geonids. Just say, "We have to
share resources, you are welcome to petition a GM if you disagree, who
will tell you that we have to share resources. Good day." Then just
kill them as you please, though not fighting one that other player
already has engaged. 
People are just too piggy in this game and the only way to stop that
is to slap them with the rules.
