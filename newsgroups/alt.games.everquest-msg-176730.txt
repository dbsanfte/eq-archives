I'm looking at upgrading/building my box into the premier 2box system.
 Ultimately I am looking to have 3 machines hooked up to the same
setup and toggling through with a switch box on a hotkey switch...

Anyhow, the first thing I need to research is what video card will
work best for what I'm trying to do...

I want to use EQW (Or EQ when they FINALLY get around to supporting
this) to run EQ in a window, and run 2 instances of EQ.  The reason
I'm looking for a dual head video card is so I can run EQ on both
monitors at once and have visual access to either of them to
facilitate quick changes between them.  I know the current crop of
Nvidia's products and the stuff from ATI Radeon series support dual
head video, but does anyone have any experience running EQ on the 2nd
monitor with this sort of setup?

Any info you can provide if you're successfully running a config
similar to this would be appreciated. . . such as Amount of RAM, Video
card/Model/Ram, CPU (Pentium/AMD?), and soundcard (And do you enable
sound?)

Thanks in Advance,

p.s. - The end goal is a bit lofty, but I'd like to be able to run 3
CPU's hooked up to a switch box on two monitors.  With 1 motion I can
switch between 3 pairs of characters, and with another motion I can
switch between each of those characters.  To assist in controlling
this, I'm looking at using Belkin switchboxes and 3 Thrustmaster
Tacticalboards (one to each machine) with hotkeys configured for
changing between characters and full EQ commands...

This way I'd be able to run a full EQ Group from 1 position with
minimal impact on my physical environment/space.  Not everyone who
aspires to play 6 toons at once can afford 6 boxes with LCD's on each!
