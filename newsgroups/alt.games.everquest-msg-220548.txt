Nope, not familiar with that item. Bout the only thing I ever hunt in
Nadox is the cryptkeeper since that guy has a couple of decent drops
even for lvl 60+ people.

Noted. ... and yes, I can see where this would be a really nice item
in a few levels. I'll keep an eye out in the bazaar, even if I did see
it drop I'm sure some of the hybrids I generally group with in Tactics
would call NBG on it so my odds of getting it for an alt are pretty
much non-existant (not that I'm complaining).

Shadowflame has a pretty nice graphic, looks like a big 2-handed
swords with runes etched down the sides.

Heh, if you didn't figure it out that's how my ranger ended up with
one. He was parked in the zone for tracking cuz I wanted the ring and
it got to the point where all the tanks I was dragging along when he
was up had one. 4 kills, 4 shadowflames and no sign of the ring when I
gave up on it. 

I'll send you a writeup on the camp, should be trivial for the two of
you. 

Rgds, Frank
