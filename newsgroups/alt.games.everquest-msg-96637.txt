    I'm a little worried about the "no corpse until level 11" thing, too,
but we'll see how it pans out. I think it might make the levels around 11 or
so into real "learning curve ahead" levels, since class roles are JUST
beginning to differentiate at that point as well. Having to learn how to be
your class as well as learning all the basics you mentioned at the same time
might be rough.

    Be interesting to see what sort of load this puts on the servers,
especially with no real reason for those level ten and lower players to
clean the corpse.

same." -- Catbert.

    Can't say I'm for hazing folks when they join the game. "Welcome to EQ,
and isn't this level freakishly hard?" I think people will be more inclined
to level high if the levels are progressively harder rather than disjoint
like they are now. I'm all for smoothing, if that is in fact what's
happening.

    If it's just smoothing, then it isn't easier. It just isn't as annoying.
You may find, in fact, that it makes things more difficult. What levels do
those solo casters get new spells - just before, or just after hell levels?
So when they're one level away from new spells, and at their weakest
relative to the environment, they'll have to spend MORE time under a
smoothing system.

    Again, having the spellbook removed doesn't make the game much easier
(although I do think it'll be easier after this change, unlike with
smoothing above). But it will make the game more engaging, more immersive.
When my cleric was sub-35, I played like a standard cleric. Sit, med, stand,
heal, sit, med. I couldn't do much more because I couldn't see anything
except when standing to cast. From 35 on, I've been a part of the action -
calling adds, helping with crowd control, anticipating how combat will
evolve. I feel more like I'm in a fantasy world fighting evil and less like
I'm casting a heal for X% of a tank's health when he reaches Y% health and
I'm at Z% mana, which was all I had to look at before. I wish you'd gotten
your necromancer to 35 before this had happened, so you could see just how
big the difference is in how engaged you are.

    Very extreme. With the exception of the "no corpse to 11" rule, I see
the changes so far as ones designed to make the low level game more engaging
and more complete (with the spells that encourage dungeon exploration). I
don't think you'll find it changes much about the high-end game, or even
make the high end game easier to get to. But it just might make the high end
game more evolutionary, as opposed to revolutionary.

    You say that it isn't about being easier, but that it was about the game
being tough. No wonder the other poster's confused! :-)

    Like I said above, don't confuse "tough" with "annoying". I think you'll
find that if the changes are as we think they are, that things will be just
as tough - just far less annoying.
