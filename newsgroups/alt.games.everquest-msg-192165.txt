I had to do the following to get EQ and the free version 
of ZoneAlarm to play together.

1.  Log on EQ and let the first "do you want to allow this" for the 
frontend program, Everquest.exe, come up.  Click yes and yes to "remember 
this next time".

2. Then I got off eq without logging on

3.  Then I turned off ZA and logged all the way on to a character on a 
server. 

4.  Went into windowed mode.  Freed up the cursor (shift-alt-R) and 
minimized EQ (this may have been overkill)

5.  Then I restarted ZA.  When it launched the usual dialogue box cam up 
for allowing EQ to access the net.  I clicked yes then remember.

6.  I switched back to EQ, which by this time had timed out on a link dead, 
and got out of it.

7.  Then I went to ZA found eqgame.exe and allowed server and remember.

8.  Then I fired back EQ and we were in business.
