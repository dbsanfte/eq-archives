Yes I do.  And I agree.

In theory, that's what the "Quality Assurance - Testing" forum is
for:

http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Quality+Assurance+-+Testing&number=2

They even announced on 2/1/02 that they'd be doing that more
often:

    Greetings Citizens of Norrath ! I'd like to 
    welcome you all once again to this board. 
    Going forward this board will be used more 
    frequently to communicate known bugs, their 
    status, and even to collect information regarding 
    bugs. I look forward to hearing from you all.

However, since that time there have only been two
such messages, regarding the weird faction messages,
and the random "bad" messages.

Switch the forum to show all posts in the previous year
and look at how often "known bug" posts had been made
up until 10/11/01 -- there were some every couple of days.

Strangely enough, there are more frequent (but still
not frequent enough) acknowledgements of bugs on the
*Developer's* forum than on the Testing forum.
