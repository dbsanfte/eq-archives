Thanks for the EQCaster program, but there is a BIG problem with it.  I
downloaded it (both versions) & only saw an *.EXE file in there.  I only
have option to open an "eqspells.txt" type of file, but there wasn't one
with it & my EQ directory doesn't have one.  Can you provide one or show me
where it is?  You can e-mail it to me if you'd like (fix the anti-spam in
the address).
