Just out of curiosity is this a new thread where you put "Re:" at the start,
or a very old one?  I don't know how to tell besides doing it the hard way
that I'm too lazy to do. :)

If it's a new thread please don't start it with "Re:" that only confuses
people like me.   As to your thoughts, I'd just post a "me too" reply so I
won't bother.
