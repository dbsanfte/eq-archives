The analogy doesn't hold up well, true, but your reasoning why and
dismissive attitude doesn't stand up well either. The real reason that
the analogy fails is that, IRL, there are laws *against* such things. If
somebody comes up in your driveway and pops open the hood of your car
and starts poking around, you can get a cop over there and have them
arrested (if you're fast).  In EQ there is not only no law against it,
but the "cops" in this case, have given out free "hood lock" keys to
everyone else's cars in case they want to check out your rod.
