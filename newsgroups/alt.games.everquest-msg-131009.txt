No you don't have to. Let it be known that people should get there
on their own if at all possible. What I find is that things are
usually scheduled yet these people pop on 10 minutes before the start
and ask for a port from wherever they are. Let them know this is not
going to happen. I was doing this in a guild for a while and porting
for 45 minutes before an event and 30 minutes after gets pretty god
damn old when these lazy sacks of poo could simply get to the damn
thing themself in a hell of a lot less time than 45 minutes. There is
no reason why you have to take up the slack for everyone else.

People forget this:

Porting is to get YOU and YOUR group to a spot much faster as a
convenience, mostly for YOU. This is one of the points of your
character. When instead porting others in the guild is making you have
MORE downtime then they are, something is wrong.

Again, stop saying have to. Let it be know that the late comer gets
their on their own and porters don't leave to get them. Once again,
WHY are you taking up the slack and suffering MORE than people who
can't port? It makes no damn sense.

So stop that, I eventually did. What I do is go to an event, in the
same way that everyone else can get to the event. If someone pipes up
that they'd like a port right when I'm on my way I will get that ONE
person. When I'm leaving I'll ask where a person in my group wants a
port to and the first person to say where they want a port to, such as
dreadlands, decides where I am porting to the SINGLE TIME. Then I say
"okay, I'm porting to dreadlands anyone not going to dreadlands leave
the group." If there are slots left I'll say "first 3 people to come
and poke me for dreadlands port in the next few seconds are going."

Some stuff that cheesed me off a lot that I helped to eliminate along
with the other porters was, you are not binding at the raid so why if
you can gate are you trying to get a port with me out of there? If you
can gate then gate your own damn ass out and let the people who have
no choice get a port out. A porter is not your "end of raid convenient
travel option" but rather and emergency method of leaving for those in
need.

End it. Get with the other porters and you'll find that many of them
feel the same way. Make a board post about it on your ezboard guild
site. No one expects the clerics to stop what they are doing and go
run around resurrecting everyone an hour before the raid starts, no
one expects the enchanter to go around and cast clarity on everyone an
hour before the raid starts, no one should be expecting you to go
around and pick everyone up.

Myself and our other porters made it known that the only time we were
doing much picking up was spur of the moment stuff. If lodizal is
spotted or something then the call goes out for people to get to a
ring. Its also known that its best if a bunch of you get to the same
ones and anyone who can get a port to IC on their own do so. Time is
short. Otherwise when you have a hate raid at 7 pm on wednesday which
has been scheduled for a week  and everyone is supposed to meet at the
GFAY spires, no one should be asking for a port at 6:30 pm to get near
gfay nor should you probably go and pick them up.

You have to actually be kind of mean about this for it to get across
to other people, its kind of a "Uh.. I'm grouping here and will leave
for the raid at 6:50 since we are supposed to be there then and I can
port...." thing. Porting is YOUR convenience, not the convenience of
everyone who knows you.

Its going to be hard at first but be firm and people will come around.
They have to realize that you are not their slave or their mommy and
for them to get off your teat.
