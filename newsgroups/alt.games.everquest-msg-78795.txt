We don't invis, since everything still gives us EXP, even if they are cyan.  
We just fight down to the library and camp there and pull from everywhere 
semi-nearby.  We'll then fight to the runelord on the way out and try to 
get the bard sword ( still haven't ), and then leave.

Last night was our last foray into Kaesora ( until we go for fangs ), 
assuming everyone shows up tonight for the run to CoM.

I'm going to miss that place *sniff*  Hit 41 last night right before the 
breakout, and got 3.5 blues on the way out.  If you can handle carrying all 
the FS weapons that drop, you can make decent loot.
