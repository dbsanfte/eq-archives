I"m astonished not to see you saying "I snare and fear..."  what
on earth is the monk doing accepting any damage at all with
a SK in the group?

As for the paladin (cough*twink*cough) I don't think you
should suggest that as a normal function of the class, nor a
normal strategy at your level for reducing down time.

A good healer should be able to juggle damage repair
sufficient to keep a meatgrinder going, though, anyway.
