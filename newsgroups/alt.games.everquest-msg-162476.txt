AOL is good for people who don't know much about the internet and who 
just want an easy way to get connected, that has some kind of support 
system, and that they don't need to do much thinking about to get going.

I'll admit, when I bought my computer almost 3 years ago, I went with 
AOL.  And I loved it for a while, helped me learn how to use the 
internet.  Then I started getting disconnected while playing board 
games.  Too much spam!  Alot of little problems that creep up sometimes. 
  I just wasn't happy and finally decided on a DSL connection instead.

A few months after getting DSL, I went shopping for an online game and 
ended up wasting half my life since then in EQ.  Now, who do I blame: 
AOL for being shitty service?  or DSL for being so good that I wanted 
something to justify the bandwidth?  or is it Verant for making a game 
that is so hard to leave?
