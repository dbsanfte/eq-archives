Agree, it's EVERQUEST, not EVERMONOPLY. He ought to stop farming items
and sitting his ass in EC get up and explore, and travel. Beauty of
depreciation of items means for the most part is that sooner or later
the farmers move on to the next PhAt L33Tz "quick plat turn around"
allowing my characters a shot at an item instead of some pinhead "with
no life who can camp a mob for 12 hours" farmer trying to "corner the
market" on an item.

The games about adventuring with friends, exploring, fighting. You
want economy, get Monopoly online.


As for trade skills, my guild mates are quite happy I can ply Alchemy
so the that trade skill is just fine by me.
