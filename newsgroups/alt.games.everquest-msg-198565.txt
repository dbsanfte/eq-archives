What comeback?! It's the truth. You don't think tradeskills have any 
place in the game. Fine. Plenty others, myself included, *do*.

You're a pompous arrogant twit to think it should be made *your* way, and 
anything straying from that is wrong. The game is naturally going to be 
many things for many people.

Tell me this, brainiac, how smart would it be to simply make the game 
something strictly involving killing stuff and levelling up? Don't you 
think people like a diversion now and again? Do you think people will 
*pay* for a game with no more diversity than that?

Blah, blah, blah. Never-freakin'-mind. Here's one I'll give up before it 
even gets started. The only thing you are asserting here is to be a dick.
