Has a nice list and detailed guides to necro soloable areas for your level.

I would recommend the Frogs in PoS at 60 - fairly easy soloable, SoW potion
or at least RS3/ J-boots required (heck of a lot of HP and hit like trucks
though) - they will con yellow to you at 60 and give around 5% xp / 8% AA
per kill. XP on these drops of to around 2% at 61 so take advantage of the
good XP and maybe clock up SCM3 there before hitting 61. PoN and PoD also
very easy for 60 necro but tier 2 is the place to be for good XP. Be
prepared for resists on darkness!
