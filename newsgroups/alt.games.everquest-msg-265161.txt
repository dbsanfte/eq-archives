Hell yeah, and I don't count it a win unless I put that fucker DOWN!

I do this all the time - I'm always grabbing the balls of strange 
people, not just jugglers, though.

No, usually I just shoot the 10-pin with a target rifle.

I did that to this snotty bastard Bobby Fischer - who'd have known he'd 
take it so badly?

Being somewhat serious now, this is a boundary issue. Some people have 
very rigidly defined boundaries, others have very nebulous ones.

It's a cultural thing, it's an age thing, it's a socialization thing.

You see it in everything, not just MMOs.

If someone did it *repeatedly* when I asked them to stop, that would 
violate my boundaries. Someone just doing it once, on accident, and then 
apologizing might violate someone else's boundaries. Depending on my 
mood, my boundaries might change, to be less or more rigid.
