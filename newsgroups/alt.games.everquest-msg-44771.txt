 Ummm... even some of the old, original zones don't get used much.
Nurga, Droga, Najena, and Kunark zones Kaesora, Dalnir, Chardok, CoM, 
Howling Stones, etc. etc.. don't get heavily used despite experience
bonuses and very nice loot.
 
 I blame the engineering and planning of the zones, not the players 
that avoid them for whatever reason. Hell in some zones the addition
or removal of one single MOB could change it all around, you know,
that cluster of MOBs that makes it impossible almost for a single
group or person to get in. 
 
 As far as Stonebrunt goes, a ranger friend and I (Level 60 Wiz) went
for a little tour of Stonebrunt and we promptly got swarmed and quickly
killed but gorillas. Ok.. unless a serious need for me to go there 
even with a lower level alt, I simply won't be going back.
