heh, this is similar to my experience. I've played EQ for 2+ years, and
the things that keep me in it are:

- taking breaks (multi-month long, when needed) from the game
- played AO for a month, and boy, did parts of it make EQ look great
- starting new characters; I still have yet to try every class I am
interested in. One thing EQ does well, I think, is that the gameplay is
noticeably different between classes (unlike AO).
- a close, small circle of friends. I'm not talking about getting on and
talking to your guild, I'm talking about a group of 3-5 other players
who you enjoy spending time with, and grouping with them almost
exclusively.

After my recent dalliance with AO, I came back to EQ just as several of
my old groupmates were also getting back into the game. We all started
new characters and have been having a blast playing together from
scratch. 3 of us are dwarves, another is a gnome, and we've been
wandering around Faydwer kickin' butt, questing, and roleplaying with
each other. It's a blast. If you have some friends in game that would do
this with you, I recommend it.
