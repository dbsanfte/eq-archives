I killed him loads of times without any problems with the root and dot
method.If I see him I usually kill him for the exp as I would any blue i
passed.Soloing a mob like Shardtooth is a much bigger pain in the butt which
is quite manageable too. Whats all the hype with Slate??I'm not making out I
am anything special as the most basic of methods work
consistently...../shrug
