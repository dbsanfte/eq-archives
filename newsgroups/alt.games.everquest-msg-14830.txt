Actually, do you use ICS (Internet Connection Sharing)?  I do, and I've read
that this can cause disconnects when zoning.  I have "good" days and "bad"
days with this, and it seems to happen at certain zone lines more often then
others.  My ICS is shared from the primary PC I play EQ on, and it has the 2
requisite NIC's.
