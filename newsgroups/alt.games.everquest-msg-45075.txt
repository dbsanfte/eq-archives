Ah that is true, a bank and such. Plus they should have made all
races/classes start apprehensive with the kitties. 

My druid is level 55= no quests because of Trivial code.

My Dark elf cleric is 37, no quests because glower by default (just
thought maybe the halfling mask before turning things in would help..
but thats a lot of trouble if one does not do it.)

My troll sk is 32, the zone is really the BEST for it to do at that
level but no quests for it because its SCOWL. So no content for me in
stonebrunt unless I want to start yet ANOTHER character and I don't.
At least she has the fun of killing them though ;)
