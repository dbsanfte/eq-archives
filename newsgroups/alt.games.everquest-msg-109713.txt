    Have two necromancers in a group with four casters /duel each other,
then start casting Mind Wrack. 600 mana per minute to the four casters,
above and beyond what the necros normally transfer, at a cost of 300 mana to
each necromancer. That's nearly the same as a full Rod of Mystical
Transvergence per minute per person. On our Avatar of War runs, our target
mana consumption for CH groups is exactly one Rod per minute, with four
clerics, a mage, and a shaman (for Torpor) per group. Swapping out the mage
and shaman for two necromancers results in just about as good a mana
transfer rate, and doesn't involve possible low health aggro, losing target
while fishing for rods, or pure dependence on one of the members of the
group for all mana transfer needs. And we don't need to get Spellshield or
Runes beforehand, either. :-) Necromancer transfers also work better on
low-HP folks like Wizards, who don't have the time to Epic before every Rod.

    Our paladins can gain aggro pretty well, between stuns and group heals.
They also don't render a mob unmezzable in case a change of strategy is
required, and can self-heal much better than any SK (being able to leave an
off-tank alone can be important). Again, what cinches it for me is that
we've had raids where we had lots of issues because we didn't have a paladin
to, say, get on the Rampage list instead of a cleric. We haven't had raids
where we go, "Damnit, if only we had a Shadow Knight this would be so damn
easy!"
