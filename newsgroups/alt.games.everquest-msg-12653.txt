There's a big difference between plz and please and between SoW and Spirit
of the Wolf, namely, 12 characters.  IMO people who use plz thx and other
bastardizations on a regular basis look like cretins.  Maybe they aren't
really cretins, but they sure look like it.  How long does it take to type 3
extra characters?  Yes I've met some perfectly normal people who use them,
but let's just say they are in the minority.  There was a thread down there
about noobie beggars, I think we can all agree that they're one of the
lowest castes in MMORPGs, well how many noobie beggars have you met that
said "please" and "thank you"? Maybe you're on a better server than me, but
I've met 0.  They are always like "dude cna i haev some platz plz? k thx!"
"sow plz!".  To me it's not a matter of being polite, it's a matter of not
looking like someone who just finished 3rd grade :)  Would I not buff
someone just because of saying plz? Probably not, depending on the way they
say it.  If they are one of those rare people who are perfectly normal, yes
I will still buff them, but if they are an aforementioned noobie beggar, I
probably would not based on the principle of it ;)
