Great solid start to a group

Agreed. With the druid snaring, monk pulling, cleric healing and enc
mes/slowing the mob is going to be 'unpredictable'

Warrior. You need a heavy meatshield and good taunter with the 'crunchy'
group you outlined above. With the druid  handling the secondary healing
duties, a pally would be solely tanking, a job warriors are slightly
better at. Rangers are more suited to offensive roles, than defensive

With that group you're going for pure melee damage from the
warrior/monk. Assuming you're mid-high level you have a choice between a
quick fix nuker or a long term meleer. In some situations a wiz would
work well, but would need to regain mana for every point of damage they
took. A mage is a good compromise. Manaless damage from the pet, with
nukes thrown in. On balance though, I'd choose a rogue hands down as it
fits perfectly with that setup. No need to med, huge amount of manaless
damage

With war/mnk/rog/clr/dru/enc you're pretty much set for zero downtime
killing. War takes all the damage, watched over by the cleric. One mob
at a time courtesy of the monk puller with the enc to mess and adds.
Druid snares everything to prevent runners and keeps enc's hps topped up
Hasted rog and mnk stand opposite war and get free damage. If played
with a little skill this group will excell just about everywhere and
have no downtime after all but the worst pulls. Even then, the druid can
just evac if it turns sour hehe
