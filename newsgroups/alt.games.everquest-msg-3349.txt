Um, I don't think so.  I don't see how it can be called
"kiting" when the Mob (and you) are motionless most of the
time.

"Kiting" is generally applied to situations where you run
around with the mob running after you, like a kid running
up and down a field towing a kite behind him (using the
speed of his running to generate enough "wind" for the kite
to stay aloft).  Just as the kid is trailed everywhere he
runs by the kite on the string, a kiting spellcaster is
trailed by the mob(s) as he runs hither and yon around
the countryside.

This can be done any way that you can manage to stay ahead
of the mob while your spells whittle it down, either by
having SoW on so you can outrun it at high speed, or Snaring
(or otherwise slowing) the mob so you can stay ahead of it
without working up as much of a sweat (or some combination).

The same idea (but a lot less like a kid towing a kite)
is applied for "fear kiting" (also called "reverse kiting"),
where you Fear or otherwise get the mob to run, and then
YOU chase IT all over the place (instead of vice versa)
as you kill it.  This is the only kind of kiting that is
workable for a melee type (my Paladin enjoys fear-kiting
Spectres), since in the regular type of kiting, if you're
close enough to hit the mob, it's close enough to hit you,
thus defeating the whole purpose.  It's also the only type
of kiting that mobs do to players -- I've been fear-kited
to death by the undead in Kith a few times.
