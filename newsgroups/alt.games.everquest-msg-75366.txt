Verant opposed to this. They don't want a way for you to gain skills
through possible macroing. 

FYI, in UO people did exactly what you are saying via AFK macroing
(hitting a dummy a ton to skill up)

By the way, there ARE npcs you can do this with without using a dummy,
one of them is Izera a dark elf lady in SRO. She does move though so
you really can't do it AFK. The reason you can do it is nearly
invulnerable and has a ton o' HP and super regen so you and some other
people can beat on her happily forever.

No idea if verant frowns on that, they eventually "nerf" it so the NPC
attacks giving the said players a surprise someday when they are
unprepared ;) They did this with the gnome vendor in freep everyone
used to use as a "training dummy."

Verant wants you to gain skill through combat, not repetitive tasks,
so they design the game that way.
