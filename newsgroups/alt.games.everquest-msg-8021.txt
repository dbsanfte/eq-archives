I'm running Win2k on a Athlon 900 mhz.. 512 mb's ram, Geforce2 MX 32 meg,
and a Sound Blaster Live, with DirectX 8.0a.. I have done the thourough file
check and I know that this is not a problem with my ISP, I use DSL with
bellsouth.net out of Louisville, KY. My problem is this.. when loading game
and while in game my sound is terrible and the screen flickers oddly. At
times while hunting or even when meming spells, this is on multiple servers
and areas, the game will freeze up.. eventually I will be able to move again
but by then I have gone link dead, about a minute afterwards I crash to
Disconnected from Server.. I can get back online after this.. but it is a
real pain. Has anyone else had this problem? Know of where I can get more
info? or has any suggestions that might help me in fixing this.
