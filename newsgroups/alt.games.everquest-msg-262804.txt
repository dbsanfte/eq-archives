Yes but

A) the amish kids often own cars and drive at this age, they don't 
decide whether to go full amish until after a period of experimentation 
with the "english" ways.

B) 99% of the population isn't amish even here in Lancaster county, 95% 
isn't even menonite (and they drive, its just that their cars are all 
black with no chrome, Henry Ford would be so proud)

C) I've never employed an amishman, not because I wouldn't, but because 
none have ever asked for a job.

It could be, though, that living here has some effect on the kids, who 
perhaps don't feel the need to drive because after all, some adults are 
getting around on horse driven buggies.  I don't think thats the case, 
though.

More likely, its one of the phenomena Aruvqan mentioned, the Taxi of Mom 
thing.  They don't need a car if mom is always ready to drive them 
anywhere they want.

That wouldnt' have worked for me, though, because a car didn't just 
represent the ability to move around, it, like the bike before it, 
represented the ability to go where I wanted, when I wanted, without 
discussing it with anyone, asking for favors, inconveniencing them... it 
represented freedom.

So is it that the kids today don't want freedom, or is it that they 
don't have the illusion that a car, with its expense, the price of gas, 
the price of insurance, and so on, actually represents freedom?

deck and the sails; thats what the ship needs. But what a ship is...what 
the Black Pearl really is, is freedom."
