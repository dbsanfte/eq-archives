I very much doubt the items will poof.  I "bought" (for free) the
commemorative coin that was offered during the 5th anniversary,
and it did not go poof.  In fact, it is the same item as the 6th
anniversary coin -- I wasn't able to get another coin this year
(they're lore), and when I checked last year's coin in my bank,
I found it had acquired the +50 CHA that the current coin has.

So it seems likely the items WILL stick around afterward.  What
MIGHT happen is that the stats will be removed or reduced.  I have
no opinion on the likelihood of that.  But for my characters who
are currently using the doll and coin for the stats, I'm not going
to get rid of their old Range and CHA items just yet. :-)
