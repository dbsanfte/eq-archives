What guilds are on Morell Thule and who joins them for what reason?

I can look things up om www.morell-thule.com just as well as any of
you, but the freewheeling discussion is nice to have.

Many of us are unhappy with the uproar some have complained about with
guilds. I hope this is a positive step.
