Its not a huge deal, but if only 15 I'd give the gear to a friend
to hold and start a new char (or just log both out in same safe
spot and drop it for other char) I'm assuming you mean you did not 
max wis? No matter what anyone else here says that kind of comes back
to bite you on your ass the rest of your character's life.

It is far better to start over now at 15 than to be level 55 in a
resist kit and only have 230 wisdom and think, "hmm.. if only I'd
maxxed my wisdom when I made my character I'd have 245 wisdom right
now.. darn.. why'd I listen to those other people and not start
over???"

So max widom, no other stat really matters for a cleric unless you are
a dwarf one then you want to make SURE your agil is at least 75 (they
start lower than that) Below 75 you take a LARGE ac hit while 75 is
fine. Max dwarf and dark elf wisdom is 118 with high elf being
something like 125? I forget the exact numbers. Whichever race you
choose is not a huge deal, just max the wisdom.
