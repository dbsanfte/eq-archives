    Runnyeye, a LONG time ago. Six dwarves who'd never been but thought it
would be neat. One puller (not me) who didn't know the pathing deep in. And
one cleric (me) who didn't have Root up. When my screen froze as I walked
backwards through the zone out to the Gorge, I counted over a dozen goblins
and an Evil Eye. And those were just the goblins I could see.

    Also Velk's Lab: one cleric (me) trying to do a CR when she should have
just logged on her rogue. Two groups (back room and upper spiders AKA
Frenzy) that both stopped pulling for a while when people went AFK, and were
the only groups in the zone. One lost corpse that had to be searched for, as
opposed to just retrieved. Paralyzing Earths that landed, and Atones that
didn't. And a cleric that thought she was her rogue, and ran out as opposed
to hitting DA and dropping. I didn't get a final tally on the train, which
turned extra lethal when Hunters added to pick off any poor souls who were
hiding or invis. It DID start ping-ponging from person to person after I
zoned, and when I zoned back in to see how things were (I never looked back,
and had no idea what was behind me) I saw a person run to zone with what
looked like a river of spiders behind him. I zoned and stayed out until it
was done.

    Oh, and Karnor's! Hand group, the puller gets many adds pulling the
Bodyguards in Warlord up to us, the Hands start repopping, cleric (me) goes
OOM, then the enchanter goes LD. The call "run away!" is made, and somehow
the mobs all stay on the tanks and don't summon me. I tear out of there, see
the Skeletal Captain PH mobs are up on the way out (little did I know
EVERYTHING was up between me and the Drolvarg Captain group), so I jump off
the battlements and swim to the far shore screaming "TRAIN!" As I run
through the left corner moat group, their cleric healed me. I ran straight
to zone, again not looking back, but from the casualty reports later it was
one hell of a train - everything from Warlord on out.

> TRAIN THAT YOU PERSONALLY WITNESSED IN GAME:

    Karnor's: "Basement to zone!" The zone-in area was messed up with mobs
for a good half-hour.

    The bored bard camping Ragefire that brought everything from the
Efreeti's room to Nag's lair (excluding giants) to the Ragefire group to
kill. I'd never seen that many Imp casting messages at once before.

    The group that lost control of things at the Blood of Chottal area in
Sebilis, and managed to run to the portal out through a full repop,
including the entire Necrosis Scarab hallway (which we were just setting up
to camp). That's when we found out our druid didn't have an evac memmed, and
watched as he sent us to South Ro moments before the returning train (with
mobs from a fully-popped zone out area) slammed into us.

    A number of Castle trains in Velk's - trains where someone casts on a
mob in front of the castle, not realizing how many mobs will chain-aggro off
that or what a roundabout route the mob must take to get to the spider area.

    Some poor slob in North Karana that had the Swarm (over 60 tiny
scarab-type mobs and a larger Queen-type mob) spawn right on top of him. I
took that one out with two Upheavals after a druid cherry-picked the Queen
out of the swarm.

> TRAIN THAT YOU EVER HEARD OFF:

    Arriving at Velk's one day, I noticed a large crowd outside, most naked.
"What happened?" "Velketor the Sorceror to zone." He apparently warped right
to the opening into the main spider area with a large host of his retainers.
When I zoned in I saw carnage everywhere, and one lone Sentinel trotting
slowly up the ramps to get back home.

    James
