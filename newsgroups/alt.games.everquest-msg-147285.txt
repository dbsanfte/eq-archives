I work in the media... and this statement is total fucking bullshit. 
We lost some of our own people in the attacks too.  We have to cover
this from a historical standpoint.  Would you rather Jerry Springer
all day?  If we did, you'd all complain that we didn't care enough to
cover the ceremonies.  I'm sick of your types thinking we always do
wrong.  Then again, we have to dumb down our scripts for the rest of
you, so I can't say I'm surprised.  I guess it comes down to "You can
only please some of the viewing jackasses some of the time."  Watch or
don't watch... but don't blame the media if you can't handle your
emotions.
