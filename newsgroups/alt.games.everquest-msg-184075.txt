Since the nasty froggies took over my homeland, I cannot find a
place to buy my spells.  I am fast approaching lvl 24 and am
looking forward to the new ones.  I can only go to the original
continents, Kunark, and Velious, as I do not have Luclin nor POP
nor LOY.  I have searched all through Neriak, including the
foreign quarters, commons, and third gate -- they have some low
level shaman spells there, but nothing I need.

Any suggestions?
