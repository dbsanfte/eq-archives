I have two items that need to be /CLAIMed in EQ. One is the ingame
item from GoD and the other is the PC Gamer shield from last month's
issue. Every time I ahve tried using the /CLAIM command it has told me
that the items cannot be claimed. I have used the bug tool under Item
Reimbursement, but got the message back from Sony to resubmit this
request under the proper heading and delete the ticket.

I have emailed Sony tech support and I am waiting for a response. (Not
holding my breath on that one)

I swear Sony's customer service blows. Makes me wonder why i even
subscribe to EQ and SWG at all.

Any suggestions on what I should do next?
