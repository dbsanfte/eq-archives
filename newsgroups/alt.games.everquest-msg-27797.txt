What happened to Eq? I never saw this much begging going on. Has Variant
made the beg hot key work on non NPC? I took a break from EQ for a while and
just started back up a new character. At 3rd, yes 3rd lvl I had no more than
5 people in a one hour time frame come up and ask me if I had any spare PP
to give them for gear. I got fed up and shouted out that "I am 3rd lvl and
quit asking me for PP!" GODS! Earn it like everyone else and if you are
LUCKY enough that some one gives you an item then by god THANK them.
