Nothing was posted that the poster himself didn't post.  Usenet is full of
geeks.  Those few who are not geeks need to be taught about such things for
their own good...especially information that is available to ANY moron who
thinks to right-click on something in OE and say "hmmm, I wonder what
"properties" tells me."

No one gave out any information about the poster that wasn't easily (repeat
EASILY) accessible by anyone who might think to look in one single place.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist and it doesn't take 3 or 4 steps to find
this information...it's found in ONE SINGLE EASY TO FIND PLACE.

You're welcome to get your panties in a wad over invasion of privacy...but
don't do it in such a place where you simply look like an idiotic paranoid
or something.  ESPECIALLY in a thread that's all about getting a new
newsreader.  Man, that's just stupid.  Posting his
extremely-simple-and-not-particularly-useful information
that's-available-to-anyone-with-an-IQ-over-20 is even ON TOPIC when it comes
to deciding where to get your news from now on.

YOUR post on the other hand was nowhere near on topic.
