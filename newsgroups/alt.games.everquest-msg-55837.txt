If you weren't getting the 'you can no longer advance your skill'
message, then you were eligible for a skill increase. As you said,
however, the RNG in EQ blows. I strongly suspect that you were just
getting screwed over by a few lines of source code a thousand miles
away. :)

Also, it's important to note that there is a fair amount of
disagreement on the actual trivial levels, especially for the older
items. I get a couple of 'corrections' each week - I used to implement
those corrections, but then I'd discover a few weeks later someone was
sending me new 'corrections' back to the original value. Hence the
disclaimer that I have somewhere on my guide that the values are
approximate.

If you're interested in some blunt, unsolicited advice, I still say
skip the studded armor entirely. It's not nearly so bad to make now as
it was early on, but it still is Not Fun.
