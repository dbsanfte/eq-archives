No off hand Skill Tests at the speed of the weapon in it. A 30 del weapon
every 3 seconds a 20del weapon every 2 secs. Whether or not that skill test
(for Dual Wield) is successful is another matter.

Generally speaking main hand should be fastest if the ratios (including dam
bonus) are similar, if the slower weapon has a much better ratio then use
it.
At 20th a Wurmslayer has far better ratio 20/45 than a Lamentation 9/19 and
so makes a better weapon for the primary hand, come 50th level and the
Damage bonus makes the lamention that much closer (by my calcs it is still
behind but I think Copelands makes it a better DPS) that it is a better
choice over the much slower Wurmy.

In the case given the ratios are close so I'd go for the faster, Icepaw's as
I stated.
