I get incorrect version only.  I was playing and zoned from lfay to gfay and
got kicked out to login.  Kept getting can't connect.  Exited all the way
out and when I tried to go back in downloaded a new eqmain.dll and now get
the incorrect version every time.  me thinks they are trying to keep people
away for the time being.
