Well I couldn't stop laughing here. Bob tells a great story about a
*group* adventure! But you try to praise WoW about its good *solo* play?
Come on, Bob doesn't seem to look for a better way to solo. He does have
a group pretty regular it seems.

After all not everybody likes the same things. If WoW fits your way of
playing - fine. But just accept that there are people who like EQ2. Heck
I'm even back to EQ1. But I really like those tales from EQ2.
