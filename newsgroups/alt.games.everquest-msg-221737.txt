One of my favorite diversions. I pick a different server and have at it. 
Trouble is, I always find myself caught in the middle of everyone around 
me twinking like crazy. I wind up almost feeling inferior wearing level 
appropriate gear and often not pulling my weight in a group as a result, 
so I go farm the hell out of tradeskill components to sell in the Bazaar 
to buy better gear...et-freaking-cetera.

If I could just hook up with some others interested in picking a new 
server sometime and starting a good ol' fashioned, old-school, no-twink 
group.  :)
