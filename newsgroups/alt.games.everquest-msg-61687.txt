Its a known bug with Win98 - see microsoft knowledge base article Q253912

The default I think, if you have the machine set up as a desktop PC, is to 
not have any settings for vcache in system.ini, and let windows do whatever 
the hell it wants. I would guess that setting it as a server actually 
tweaks these settings. The entries you should have are in system.ini and 
look like this:

[vcache]
MaxFileCache=81920
MinFileCache=16384

Where the numbers are how big you want the minimum and maximum size of the 
cache to be in kb. If you don't have an entry for MaxFileCache, it will 
have no upper limit, and Windows can happily chew up all your available RAM 
for swapping cache stuff in and out of, if it feels like it, leaving 
diddly-squat for your apps to use.
