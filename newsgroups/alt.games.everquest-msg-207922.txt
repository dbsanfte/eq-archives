Well I agree the person is better off not PLing at all, but to around
24 isnt too bad. 24 is still a level that if you do mess up, its not
too painful. At least then they can all play together.

Dont forget Charisma items. Some have argued the value of charisma for
Enchanters, but when I upped my lvl 55 enchanters charisma by 20
recently, it seems to have paid off, mezzes/stuns seem to land more
frequently. Just my personal experience. I dont often charm, so I cant
say the impact that would have had on charming. Many people complain
if you charm (cause of the xp hit) so I only do it to take control of
a bad situation where I cant mez.
