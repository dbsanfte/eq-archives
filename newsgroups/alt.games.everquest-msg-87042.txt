Yup, that would be bannable.  Basically a ShowEQ-like program, without
the safety of running on another computer, so it would be easy for
Verant to detect, *and* it competes with Legends.

This explains why it waits until you zone.  When you zone, the server
sends a list of your inventory and bank contents to the client
(probably so that the client can handle checking for duplicate lore
items when you try to buy/trade/loot things...if the client sees that
you've got the item in the bank, it can disallow even trying the
buy/trade/loot, saving load on the server).

I think I'll stay far away from Magelo.  The only things Verant
doesn't like that I'd consider running on my client would be
programmable gamepads or generic macro programs.  Even if Verant
doesn't like them, there's no way they are going to ban people for
using any Microsoft-certified input device.  If I had a desire to
sniff packets, I'd limit that strictly to a Linux box on my LAN, where
it can't be found.
