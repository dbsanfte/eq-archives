Don't rangers and shaman get invis?  I know your wizard
and magician do and suspect your enchanter does as well.

Cleric is the only class of yours stuck binding in FV, the rest
of you should bind (have bound, now you've leveled the shaman
and cleric up enough to bind in the windmill if you like) in
Cabalis.  The spot right inside the zone line is not in aggro
range of anything standing or wandering, only risk would
be someone having trained a guard there... which I've never
seen happen.  Zone out and nothing is in aggro range either
most of the time, although there is a wanderer that might be;
however  the trick is to invis up before you zone.  At any rate,
invis you only have to pass two guards to get out, you could
pull it off even on a blinking invis icon, or zone back in
and reapply.  From there, the zone ramps up gradually
in level, so while jogging out to your blue to yellow
hunting area you are passing nothing but greens, with
plenty of elbow room to avoid em.

Not one Leezard I've seen yet can see invis, I regularly
use Cabalis as a shortcut between LOIO and FOB
(it also connects directly to WW and I think yet another
zone, quite a hub) although I haven't had to bind there
since hitting 12 (14 for healers)

I still laugh at Bergh having to go the long way around
to get from LOIO to anywhere, poor little guy not having
invis, Cabalis has a big KEEP OUT sign on it still!
