This is an interesting problem that I've been thinking about.
Unfortunately Im not clued in about networks so maybe im just blathering but
sureley there is a way for the server to differentiate between a genuine LD and
a phone cord coming out of the wall? In a bona fide LD Wouldnt there be some
unsteadiness in the connection followed by a steady loss of packets compared to
a sudden halt in data sent from the user in the case of him bailing out?
I suggest this because the browser I use: Opera (Opera.com), knows the
difference between me getting cut off mid-session, offering to re-open all
windows upon starting up again, and when I just close the program quickly while
its still running.
