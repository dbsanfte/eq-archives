Not necessarily. There are lots of controls you can put in place.

For example you could incorporate the amount of negative feedback you 
leave as part of your own karma indicator.

Do you really want to group with a guy who has handed out 476 negative 
feedbacks in the last 3 months...??

That should rapidly allow the people trying to blacklist others to self 
identify. The system could even incorporate that by reducing the value 
of their feedback on others ratings as their own karma drops. ie... the 
more feedback you leave, (positive or negative), the less value it has. 
And then amplified the more negative feedback you have received, from 
people of high positive feedback.

So you save your big black dots of idiocy for the real twits, lest it 
reflect badly on you, and cease to reflect badly on others.

etc etc etc...
