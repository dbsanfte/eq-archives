Twice now, while going to the bank, my human necro (Innoruk worshipper)
has been jumped by this stupid little gnome who, I'm pretty sure, comes
out of that blue house in N. Freeport. I haven't bothered catching his
name yet, as the "fight" is rather brief. (i.e. Two hits: Him hitting
me, me hitting the floor.)
  My other factions in FP are all acceptable. Some I've improved a bit,
others are just dubious, but I don't get attacked and that's fine. I
expect my bard faction to rise after I start hunting gargoyles. But who
is this freaking gnome and what faction is he on? This is my home town
for this character. I don't give a rat's ass if I'm KOS everywhere else
(and I soon shall be, I'm sure) but I'd like to be able to walk around
my home town in safety. I would be interested in fixing this faction,
whatever it is, if it's not an act of moving heaven and earth to do so.
