On the Casters realm site there is the following slightly criptic entry 
on the Research page :

Or you combine a faded page on it's own in an attempt to restore it.

End quote.

Does this mean that I simply take single faded pages and click combine 
on them ? or do I need quils and paper ? Or is this mis-information ?

I seem to have about 5 different sorts of faded Salils writ pages, and I 
don't seem to be able to combine them for Mana Sieve. Do I need to do 
something to them first ?

Cheers,

Jim
