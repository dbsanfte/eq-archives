Nor I.  Closest I've come was, when looking for some A-V software for
friends and family, I downloaded AVG from www.grisoft.com and someone sent
me a copy of CodeRed the same day.  I've been very lucky so far, in that
it's the only case where I've received an infected attachment from anyone
(that I've known).
