When evade *did* work, I typically had to backstab or otherwise try to 
get aggro back. It's just that on each pull, even when I *know* others 
were already higher on the hate list, it would turn to me as soon as I 
got close. It was quite annoying.

Thinking about it more, I guess it's possible it happened *most* of the 
time as opposed to *every* time. I can't say I remember it not working 
the way I'm describing, but then again, I wasn't trying to note the 
absence of that first occurrance to support the superlative here today. 
However, I can honestly say without exaggeration that I'm certain it 
happened the way I described on well over half the pulls.
