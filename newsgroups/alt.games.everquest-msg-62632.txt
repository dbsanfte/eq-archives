I'm a lvl 45 Ranger who has saved up for a Lammy, just bought one
recently.  My reasoning was that the Lam was considerably lighter,
allowing me to carry more materials for fletching, stacks of bandages,
and bones etc for other groupmembers.  Perhaps I taunt a little more,
but honestly, I haven't had much trouble with aggro recently.  Not
sure why this is the case.
