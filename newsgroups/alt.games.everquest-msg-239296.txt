I dont know, but I think its cute how the first hit ALWAYS interrupts
casting, and.. unless im imagining it, cancels casting compltely.
nothing is more puzzling than the first hitting cancelling my casting, and
then being able to cast a 10 second pet heal through the hits without
failing.

anyway, its like they have the 'bum rush advantage (tm)' on that first hit.
