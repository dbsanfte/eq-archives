Get the rope out.  Simple way around that:  TLC.  Have more
than X drops in the raid, get a rusty sword.  At the challenging,
non-epic gear point of the game, TLC isn't an issue, IMO.
You don't need the Pink BP of Doom if you can do elementals,
for instance.

Seriously, that *might* be true, but I doubt it.  Upper-levels
are driven too much by challenges.  If an encounter becomes
too much of a PITA (such as a huge number of non-loot mobs)
and you can get better results from the next one, why stay?
Would you have stayed in <insert PITA zone> when you could
move on to a *tactical* challenge instand of a *patience* one?
