Not really; EQ's launch was a disaster. Broken login server, not
enough bandwidth, massive content problems especially at high levels,
bugs, exploits, and more bugs....

nothing else to play besides UO, and many the first people were coming
to EQ precisely because they wanted *away* from UO. Compare that sort
of launch in today's marketplace....
