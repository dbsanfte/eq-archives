To a point, yes. You're not always running the gauntlet, so to speak, but
playing as if you are is generally a good rule to follow.

The Team servers(Tallon/Vallon Zek) are cash-only. Rallos Zek allows you to
take all cash, plus one item, excluding: items in Weapon/Shield/Range/Ammo
slots, containers, items in containers, no-drop items, and Lore Items that
you already possess.



> and level difference that determines who u can and cant attack?

Team Servers: +/- 8 levels, if they are not on your team.

Rallos: +/- 4 levels, and you can attack anyone.
