could be worse...

remember the bad old days?

click one 'field point arrowhead' from the stack and place it in fletch
kit...
click one 'wooden arrow shaft' from the stack and place it in the fletch
kit...
accidentally click the whole stack of 'ceramic vanes' and place it in the
fletch kit...
click one 'large nock' and place it in the fletch kit...

... click 'combine'... wonder what just happened to 50 plat worth of
'ceramic vanes'

scream, cry, curse, swear you'll never tradeskill again... then go buy
another stack of 'ceramic vanes'

...at least now it doesn't swallow whole stacks and just laugh at you :o)
