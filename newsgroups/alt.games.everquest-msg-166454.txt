Right now the king is the ATI Radeon 9700 Pro or ATI 9700 All in Wonder
(everything you ever wanted a video card to do but were afraid to ask).
GeForce 4 Ti 4600's are not to shabby either. Anything nVidia makes with the
letters MX in them should be shot. As should be the guy who came up with
them.
Then new GeForce (GeForce FX? 5? whatever they are calling it) is in
production prototype stage, currently its reference boards and the 9700 are
neck and neck in terms of performance. Expect the new card to edge out as
they optimise drivers for release. Expect a bit more speed out of the 9700
as ATI squeezes the drivers for everything they can to compete.
If you want full total DirectX 9.0 compliance, right now you have to go ATI,
but that's not as big an issue as the ATI fanboi's make it out to be.
Also, many people report that the ATI based cards do not live up to what
they should on EQ. I have an 8500 which I replaced my aging Voodoo 5 5500
with, and am quite satisfied. If it was me?

If I had to have the card for Christmas, I'd say the ATI 9700, but I have
personal grievances with nVidia, and do wish to avoid them if possible. If
you want the ultimate card from nVidia, you can perhaps scheme to get a Gift
certificate instead, and buy the new geforce when it comes out.

Minor issue, not really related to christmas, but the top of the line
geforce is supposedly cheaper than the ATI, but that will change when the
new GeForce comes out.
