Actually, I have read the laws quite extensively.

And you are partially correct.

I *do* believe anti-discrimination laws as they pertain to gay people
is special treatment.

If homosexuals can have anti-discrimination laws, why not peopl in the
Swing Lifestyle?? Why can't it be against the law to discriminate
against them?

But why stop there?

Let's have anti-discrimination laws that protect bi-sexual people.  

Or hell, let's get away from sex all together, and make up some
anti-discrimination laws against blondes....

People are people.  Whether they be gay, bi, blonde or whatever.

People are people and it SHOULD be wrong to discriminate against
ANYONE...  For ANY reason...

So, explain to me why you support the SELECTIVE protection of certain
groups under the law??

By supporting that, it is YOU who supports bigotry and prejudice.

I stand for EQUAL treatment under the law for EVERYONE..

You stand for UNEQUAL treatment.  Preferential treatment.  Unfair
treatment.
