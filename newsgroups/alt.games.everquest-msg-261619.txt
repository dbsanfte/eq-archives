When I said "willing" I didn't necessarily mean grudgingly.  If you
get rid of ALL the time-sinks, you head down the slippery slope that
says spending 30 seconds running anywhere is boring, so all characters
should be able to teleport anywhere instantly, or something equally
silly.  Heck, spending time summoning pet toys or casting buffs at the
start of a session is boring, too; why not just let me press a key and
spend half my mana bar and get it all done?

The solution is to balance it out.  I figure if I spend an hour
fishing and that covers my tribute for 30-50 hours of play (depending
on how often I turn on my tribute buffs), that's not bad.  And I also
get to think of ways to make the fishing time less boring: by doing
tradeskill practice, or spellcasting practice, or feign-death practice,
etc.  And of course nobody's forcing me to do this; I could just spend
all my time adventuring, and either go without tribute or spend almost
all my loot paying for it.  But usually by the time my tribute runs
low I've gone up a few levels so it's time to do some skill practice
anyway, and it works out.

Well, no, but then, I wouldn't expect a plague rat tail to be worth
several hundred coppers. :-)  But the real difference is that, in a
typical RPG, there aren't thousands of players looking for stuff.  If
the GM is running a game for just 6-10 players, then over the course
of killing 40 orcs you might find only a few useful items, and in most
games they really WOULD be useful to those specific players.  And the
stuff that's not immediately useful, yes, the players will take and
sell.  (And I know players who'll take all the coppers, too!  And
frankly, if the body parts are useful for alchemy or something, I know
players who'll try to take those as well.  But usually that's not the
case for low-level mobs like orcs.)

Yes, that would be an ideal solution, though tricky to implement.
(E.g., it breaks things like "/ooc I'm looking for X, please let me
know if you see it drop!")  But the flip side is that, if everything
that drops is useful to the player or group that gets it, you can
make the drops a lot less frequent.  Then, instead of getting lots of
drops that you can't use, so you might as well sell them and use the
money to buy better gear than you could possibly find at your level,
you'd get only a few drops, not enough to sell (at least to NPCs) for
that sort of money, so you wouldn't be able to buy high-level gear,
but meanwhile all the stuff you've gotten is useful, so you'd just
use it, and boy that's a long sentence.

I very much doubt that EQ will ever change to this sort of variable
drop table, though.  It would be a LOT of work.
