Actually I would bet your characters are still there, but there is a new
server starting up. It is offering people the chance to move servers but at
a cost, so will probably only be one or two whole guilds and assorted ebays
moving to escape reps. So should be a good influx of newbies.

The old worlds stayed pretty much the same with some added zones and
connections to those zones.
