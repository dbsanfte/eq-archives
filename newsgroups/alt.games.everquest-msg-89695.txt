    My level 30 gnome mage is in Marus Seru. She doesn't hunt the Recuso,
but does kill all the wanderers. Her impression: wide open zone, fairly
hilly, picturesque in an odd way. Don't go for loot - there is pretty much
none. The majority of the wanderers - the beetles, the greyhoppers, and the
rock people - are indifferent and factionless but have wide assist radii.
There are rarer wanderers - lightcrawlers and zelniaks - which are KOS
non-factioned. Zelniaks seem to travel in pairs whenever I'm mugged by them.
I have yet to bag a blue beetle, although I've seen them in the distance -
most beetles are green Hatchlings. The greyhoppers are just starting to go
pale blue, as are the zelniaks and rock people. My 29 water pet, cast with
Focus and given summoned armour, can tank blues without any effort - it
tanked four in a row, two at a time, last night and without heals and
without me catching aggro it only went down to around 35% health. The zone
never had more than 12 people in it, and most folks were soloing.
