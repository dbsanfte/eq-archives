So you look forward to leveling so that you can visit higher level ho-hum
dungeons, level-specific loot, and hanging out with friends.

Well, that's cool, but EQ gives you that.  It could be argued that EQ's
higher level dungeons aren't boring.  But the good/bad between the two games
aren't determined by what's the SAME, it's determined by what's DIFFERENT.

DAOC has RvR on every server - good thing (if you like RvR, which you'd
better if you bought the game)
DAOC gives you very little when you level.  The difference between level 12
and 50 is the camp spot. - bad thing
EQ gives casters a reason to get to 1, 4(5), 8(9), 12(14), 16(19), 20, 24,
then every 5th level until 49, then many levels until 60.  - good thing
EQ gives melee not so great a time.  A bad thing, though everyone gets
something new throughout the game, especially in their 50s.

That's what I meant by "one thing."  RvR.  That's the only reason to gain
levels in DAOC when you can do everything else in EQ EXCEPT that.  RvR
versus content...sorry, content won out.  Leveling for leveling's sake so
that you aren't ganked as quickly as you would have been 5 levels ago.
