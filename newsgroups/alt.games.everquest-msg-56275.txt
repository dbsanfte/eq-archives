The message you get does not say its down, it says server is congested.

If its patch day, and an hour after the patch is supposed to start, then
I suppose yes, I do know.  But if its say noon, my time?  Patch should
be over but maybe it isn't.  How do I know?

A) patch message.  Hmm, no ETA of patch completion at all, not
useful.

B) Go to the web site and have a look.  No good, it says UP and
it always will.  Waste of a site.  Used to be an option, but now it
isn't.

C) Try to log in.  This should work... but it doesn't.  It returns, you
see, a false positive.  The message that tells me that servers are
congested may be accurate (real positive) or inaccurate (servers
are not congested, they are down.  It will never, ever, give me
a true negative, only hope is that I will get in... in which case I
won't be seeing a message.

D) come here and hope that someone with two computers will
successfully log in to EQ on one and post to the newsgroup on
the other.

What am I suggesting?

A) put a time of completion in the patch message.  How hard is
that?

B) fix the UP message.  Don't have to put the numbers back,
DOWN would do.  PATCH might sit better with the corporate
hacks, though. Either way, not UP when the server isn't UP!

C) probably the hardest one to implement... but only because the
other two are blindingly easy.  Still, set a flag so that my client
can tell the difference between a congested server and one
that isn't available.  Server unavailable message, or Patching
message, I don't care, just not "hey, a bunch of people are
trying to log in right now, why don't you wait a minute and
try again"

D) hmm, Verant could make a point of firing off a message
to each newsgroup saying "Patch over, come back in
the water's fine!
