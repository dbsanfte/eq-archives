Um, is it only me, or is there a slight difference between someone
telling a healer type to actually HEAL instead of going oom on nukes,
and a healer type blowing everything on nukes telling a bard to play
heal song during combat so the healer type can save the mana he
already isn't using on heals?
Besides, heal spells have a more profound effect than heal song and
*cannot* be replaced by the song in a combat situation. 

There is a difference between telling someone they are making an
obvious mistake, and telling someone to change their player style to
suit someone who is already making mistakes.
