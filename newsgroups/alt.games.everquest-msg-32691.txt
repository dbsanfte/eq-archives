I understand what you are saying, but do question how you know that is how
they chose to implement it.  I know that were I implementing it, I would not
do that, there would be one list of who is online, which contains among
other info, zone, anon status, level, class, race, etc. or there would be
one list per zone, but not both.  That just creates all sorts of potential
fun problems with conflicting information in the lists.
