Shrug. My friend on our server is about 210, 220 now... She is well
known for providing free combines and being very generous with
her time; being a druid and able to port to customers helps, I suppose,
but she doesnt have to spend an obscene amount of time gathering
components (although she does, sometimes, when she particularly
wants to make something). 

She just lets folks do the work for the items they want and come
to her. Want that uber eyepiece of wuzzleknutt tailored? Failure
rate is 95%? Then bring me enough for 20 attempts, and we'll get to
it.

Sorry you're not having fun doing it; did you  consider if you dont
like tailoring maybe you should just not do it and go kill uber mobs
for the loot you like, as its so easy by comparison?

Anyway; obviously theres a difference of opinion here. Tailoring seems
to produce worthwhile results; I was, as I said, very pleased with
my toys despite the 2 months off and on  quiet time I spent gathering
drake eggs and velium. Shadough seems to enjoy being a well known
super-tailor and meeting folk too. I guess different strokes for
different folks ;)
