Your best bet at your level is to bind right outside SolA and zone in during
peak hours. If you are lucky someone will be powerlevelling, and a heart
will drop. Just /OOC that you are looking for it.

I went with a druid and we cleared out the whole place twice, but heart
didn't drop. Really helps having a tracker helping you. Alot of people say
go to the bar area, but that isn't where i found the wizzie spawns. I found
one right at the back of the zone (north), and the other was on the opposite
side from the bar area. Seems to me that the Inferno Wizzie can spawn
anywhere that an Inferno Goblin can spawn, its just random.
We where about to leave it for another day, then the druid tracked another
goblin wizzie spawn, we ran to that area, but it was already dead. I found
the corpse and ninja looted it after i saw some newbie guild was
powerleveling a monk. I just gated after that leaving my train of goblins on
him. Remember training is ok as long as it isn't intentional. He prolly like
the mobs i pulled anyway so he could get PLed more, but I dont understand
why he suddenly sent me a rude tell from the Nexus a few minutes later.
Some people are ungrateful & evil i guess :-\
