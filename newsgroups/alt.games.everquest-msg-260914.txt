Hmm, well as a Ranger I was quite happily soloing in vxed at 65: 
harmony/root/dot/shoot, 9-11% AA per kill. Just avoid the summoners 
(Stonemites and others) and watch the ones that can't be harmonied (Hynids, 
anything >65) or see invis (Hynids), and Don't Get Hit. And when you run out 
of "easy" targets, Quit the expedition and start anew. If you're lucky you 
will get 3-4 kills per expedition, if you're unlucky there will be 2x level 
66 Stonemites at the entrance and you just bail and wait for the 6 min timer 
to expire.

Safe targets near the entrance are Hynids, Pookas and Cragbeasts, only 
difficulty is splitting the spawns and avoiding the Stonemites.

At 66 the main change is that all the Yellow cons are now White (well those 
near the entrance anyway).
