    Works for CB, doesn't work for many areas simply because nobody's there.
There is one player in Castle Mistmoore - you.

    Yeah, I watched him try to drag it around the corner to get to Crush's
castle. But that was his mistake. Had he created the bear in front of the
Slaver caves, and run it around slavers/lego camp/Taskmaster he would have
had plenty of faction spawns to kill. Usually lego camp is empty of people,
slaver caves is infrequently camped. Taskmaster is also usually fairly
barren, although that day it was camped. Which is why Retlon kept getting
loose. If worst comes to worst, just WALK the bear from place to place -
works well, although moving at walk speed might be difficult for a druid to
handle. ;-)
