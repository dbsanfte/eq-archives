In case it makes *any* difference to you, Soandso wasn't added to my Jerk 
List. This was just a precursor to the actual meat of the story.

No shit. You ever hear of common courtesy though? It's not like I was 
trying to monopolize multiple areas, just that one little spot, so small 
it made for a bit of crowding with six people there.

Of course not. That would be stupid, now wouldn't it?

And you're making ridiculous half-baked attemts at justifying extremely 
rude behavior. Where else do you see evidence of him "role playing"? Damn 
right I've already passed judgement. They've done plenty to this point on 
which to be judged.

There *was no* wider area. The camp below was fully taken.

Did you read what I wrote? Yes, I did. It was a horrible idea on their 
part to waste their time on that small a spot, much less drag me down 
with them. FYI, there is no adaptation necessary. I am quite comfortable 
in a group setting, but as I mentioned earlier, there were circumstances 
at this point that made me prefer a bit of soloing.

Like I said. There *weren't* any others available in that area, and I 
believe it was 4.

If by PnP you mean take what you want as long as you provide the 
opportunity for others to accept and go along with it, then yes, I guess 
that's what it was.

You and I have disagreed in some other areas, Jim, and I attributed it 
before to mere differences in our opinions. However, it's pretty clear 
here that you're in it only to discredit my veiw. I can see where what I 
did with the druid may have been a little on the petty side - like I 
said, he didn't make the Jerk List, and we're actually on good terms - 
but there is no possible defense for the group blatantly infringing upon 
me as they did. They took the area - an area that wasn't even big enough 
to support them - merely because they could. It would be no different 
from one full group taking Orc1 in EC from another full group merely 
because they have a stronger group. Everyone knows there is no such thing 
as camping in EQ. Everyone also knows that you still show some level of 
respect to those around you or you are a jerk.
