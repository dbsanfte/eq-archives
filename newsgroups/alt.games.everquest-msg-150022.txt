Also note that you can get big blasts of DEX from Shaman buffs.

On the other hand, you'll probably find that like most people,
once you get into one tradeskill, you'll start trying others
(especially if you start doing the several quests that require
proficiency in many different tradeskills).

So you might be best off just biting the bullet and getting a
ton of +WIS gear, or at least making that a long-term goal.
That's what my Paladin does, and now he can hit 255+ WIS
without breaking a sweat whenever he tradeskills.

In the long run, the +WIS gear will pay for itself (via
not having to buy so many "practice" ingredients because
you skill up faster).

Note:  There's a rumor that having *over* 255 WIS/INT/XXX
invokes a bug whereby the game thinks your stat has
"wrapped around" to a low number (255 is the highest
value a computer can store in an 8-bit byte).  There's
no way to verify this for sure without actually looking
at the code, but I and a bunch of other tradeskillers
can attest that having items/buffs which push your
stat over 255 certainly seems to reduce skillup rates
to a crawl.  So once you've gotten a ton of +WIS (or
whatever) items, it's worth making sure that you don't
*exceed* 255 total when you tradeskill.  (The game
will always cap the *displayed* amount at 255, but
that's no guarantee of what it's using internally,
or what your "real" total is.)
