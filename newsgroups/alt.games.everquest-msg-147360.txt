Sorry, But I believe that if you had knowm someone that died last year
you wouldn't be so non-chanlant about it.
I also believe that if your company like Verant that did have 2 New
York City Firemen as players ( These are the only 2 I knew personally
as the lived across the street from me) that died that day, you should
not just forget them, what's it take to put in a few lines on their
website. Most players just log on and never go their so you would have
never known, And why not in the message of the day, how many of you
even remember what it said 2 minutes into your game.
Juvenille...no i don't think so . Juvenile would be complaining about
how your precious TV shows have been interrupted.
You have no idea what it's like working in the city of New York.
Those of you that work in the city , you know what I mean, it's been a
year and we still all look up when a plane flies a little low on it's
way to JFK or LaGuardia.
How many funerals have you been to this year 1 maybe 2..Try 23.
Ya, easy for you to forget.
