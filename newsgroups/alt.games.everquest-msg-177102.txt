A cleric is fun for awhlie, but once in the higher levels gets
SOoOoOoOOOOoOoo boring just sitting around waiting to cast a heal spell,
then sit again and meditate for more mana.. .throw in the odd stun here
and there but that's it.  Definitely a better class at the lower levels
when you actually utilize more than 10% of your spell selection.

I'd go for a rogue to start off with and see how you enjoy that.

Good luck.
