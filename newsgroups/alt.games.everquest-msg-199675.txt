I said my money ! I could care less about protecting your damn money ! If
you are willing to let them do whatever the hell they want with your money
more power to you ! I am not NEARLY so generous.

Incidently , the people most hurt by Enron where employees with pension
plans owning only company stock. They thus all fail the test above. Enron
also failed many other tests. Several of which include a)they did not
actually produce any commodity b) they did a majority of their banking
offshore but where an american company c) They structured their employee
pension plans to bolster votes controlled by company executives (This
incidently is probably going to be illegal soon to help those who really
just can not be bothered to noodle anything out for themsleves)

Oh and it is all Clintons fault lol . He instigated a tax on wages above a
certain amount causing companies to have to find some other compensation to
entice those much maligned executives to grace the company door. Stock
options was what the workaround was called. Basically boiling down to you
can buy x shares of stock priced at whatever the rate was when we hired you
and can then sell them for whatever the market will bear after you have
sucessfully enlarged the stock price for all of us. Unintended consequences
are a real bitch sometimes. (This is of course a basic lesson in economics ;
price floors or ceiling always cause trouble,  to bad 99% of americans are
economically illiterate due to goverment schools )
