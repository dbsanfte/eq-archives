I couldn't agree more.  This is precisely the core problem with the
"only for people with PoP" restriction on the /raid system.

It makes it unusable not only for the people who don't have PoP,
but also makes it mostly unusable for the people who *do* have PoP.

If they had made it work only *in* PoP zones, it wouldn't have been such
an issue.  But by making it (theoretically) usable in non-PoP zones,
but restricting it so that *everyone* in the raid has to own PoP
or the /raid system is unusable, they've really kicked the PoP buyers
in the teeth -- a single "non-PoPer" (and there will always be one
on a large raid) makes the entire /raid feature useless even to
PoP owners.

GGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRR....
