    He didn't say he was at 255 WIS without epic, but.... even if every
point of WIS on the epic is useful (you aren't over 255), the difference
between the summoned hammer and the epic is 17 WIS. That's 102 mana total
post-200 WIS, and add to that the 65 +MANA difference and you still haven't
lost enough total pool to cast CH, or any other meaningful heal, one more
time. I agree with you, Dan, that he might be better off holding the epic
for the extra mana and fifty points of resists rather than hoping he'll get
into a melee fight, but it's not like it's a huge difference.

    As for the 255 WIS thing - heh. Most non-guild clerics I see are the
ones with 255 WIS and crap-all for +HP/MANA/resists on. Guilded clerics tend
to beef up since they have access to C3, and let their WIS slip lower. I'm
still not at 255 WIS except with C3, but once I finally finish getting the
points for ND3 (at ND2 now) I'll be just over 5000 HPs raid buffed (Ancient
Aegolism, Brell's, Blessed Armor, Brute or PE). THAT is a number you won't
see on an unguilded cleric.

    I solo the Deep Cavern Lotus plants in Fungus Grove. The spells I use
are Mark of Karn, Yaulp V, Unswerving Hammer of Faith, and Ethereal Light.
That's it - all my damage output is melee and pet melee (and my 5 point
damage shield off my gloves, but the Lotus barely melees). Most melees would
be owned hard by one of them. I'm not able to stand toe to toe with some of
the high melee damage output mobs out there, like those Shadel Bandits in
FG, but truthfully neither are many of those melees without a healer behind
them. So we're not as bad as you might think.

    I won't tell you how long the fight is when I kill one, though. ;-)
(With C3 I finish with 90+ mana, it just takes a while.)

    Hammer is 14/15 with Yaulp V, 24/15 against the undead. ;-)

    Went to res a guild shaman that solos the bear pits in Perma for his AA
after he went LD (he's earned over 100 AAs there, yipes!) and he invited me
to stay and join him. So I broke out the hammer, and he decided to buff me.
STR, DEX, Celerity, PE, and Primal Avatar - I was at 1111 ATK, the same as
one of the guild's Paladins that happened to be on (and presumably was only
self-buffed). Fighting low blues and light blues as fast as he and I could
kill them, we were earning a yellow of alt XP per hour. Our damage output
was me, his pet, one of shaman epic DoT or Bane of Nife (he alternated), and
his melee in rabid bear form when that was up. Not bad for a toy skill!
