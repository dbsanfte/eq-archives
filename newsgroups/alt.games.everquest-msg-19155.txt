Are you sure were talking about the same type of wizards? I dont recall wizards
being that much needed in groups.
Other than nuking, theres not much a wizard can do (other than teleport wich is
totally useless in battles) and its very annoying to run after a mob all the
time cause the wizard get high on the hate list. They die pretty fast too (in
the 30's and up that is). You sure have some powerfull nukes but you cant use
them often. Lets say your nuke does 250 dmg. You have to wait like 15-20 seconds
before nuking a second time or the mob jumps on you. By the time you wait for
the next nuke,, my warrior will make some 250 dmg double hitting in the 90's,
bashing for 15 at least twice. All this considering you didnt get any resist and
i didnt get too many misses. I can make some critical hits too....and a
crippling blow if im lucky ;) . Oh and my weapon proc too ! ;D  . Im sorry but
when im looking for groupmates, every other classes will have priority over a
wizard, i know that's sad cause i think verant doesnt seem to care about
wizards.
Anyway, thats my opinion and i may be 100% wrong. Ive been playing since beta
and i never found any reason why i should absolutely group with wizards. I'd say
they indeed have a "welcome" status in most group but they are far away from a
"High welcome status in most groups" ;)

My 2 cents.

Boat! ;)
