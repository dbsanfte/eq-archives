	It happened in Faydark/Crushbone on Brell one night.  A high
level mage earth pet went on a rampage at the zone line slaughtering the
young characters in that zone until some higher level players ganged
up and killed it.  Then what was apparently a level 65 air pet was set
loose in Crushbone, where it repeatedly slaughtered the entire zone
until Duke someone or other showed up and killed it, and it took *him*
half a dozen good sized nukes to do so.  

	Opinion was that this was a deliberate and rather cruel exploitation
of the bug since there's little reason for level 65 mages to be bringing
up pets inside Crushbone.
