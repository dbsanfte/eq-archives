Well said indeed. I'm all for action. I would just like to avoid costly 
(in human and political terms) mistakes. If a link to the Taliban were 
found I would wholeheartedly support their downfall.. one way or the 
other. What people here in the US should remember is that not all the 
population of some of the "bad" countries out there are "bad" 
themselves. Were all Germans in the 30's and 40's Nazis? Of course not, 
the same as all Palestinians and Afghanis are not terrorists. If they 
support their governments call for war.. then they should be held 
accountable too.
