Ok progress.
I agree that it is gear.
However in terms of dependancy it is as if it were a soul bound item.
The mage can not loose the ability to summon these items once he has the
spell.
(Bar nasty deleveling tricks)
If we are assuming that casters have appropriate spells for their level,
and get to cast them, then the mage effectivly has these items and is
not dependent on buying or hunting them.
Thus for any scenario I have seen in this thread (server transfer,
corpse loss, CR, etc.) the mage must be counted as if he had his
summoned items. Just as a druid is counted as if he had forraged some
food and water.

If you can think of a way in which a mage could not summon his items,
and yet all the debate about the other classes still remains vaild, then
go for it.

I however do not believe there is one.
