Here's the plan, get him to AoE near the Norrath Scion and make sure he
walks thru the spires as Scion won't move to him.
Scion doesn't hit as hard (500 - 1k a blow) but is seemingly immune to
damage, should be good to watch, from a distance at least.
Of course the fight will likely last over 15mins and then the sleeper will
get ported to the moon, as you don't seem to need a crystal for that :ï¿½)
