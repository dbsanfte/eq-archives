I know no one would ever try this because there is absolutely no reason to.

Yet I am saying it would be near impossible because 1.) They are guild
leaders which means they are all 60 correct? 2) There are guild leaders of

necromancers with pets...) and the sheer number of em. Not just ONE but
multiple guild leaders.
