Have thought about it a little, are there holes in this?

Assuming points are awarded for certain things, starting on time, per hour
on raid, per kill, possibly for signing up / letting RL know they wont be
turning up.

Points deducted for being late, disruption.

Cost of item = total DKP of member.
Cost of item if only one bidder = DKP earned from that raid up to that
point.

Winner of item = person who wants it who has the highest DKP.

One loot per raid unless nobody else wants the item. (DKP will be zero if
you have looted anyway).

DKP totals are taken without the current raid being taken into
consideration.

On top of that sometimes items could be class limited, eg EB weapons to
warriors, then SK pala (before ranger, berserker), FT items to pure casters,
41% haste items and DPS weapons to pure melee.
