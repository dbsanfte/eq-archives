Then do both. :) pre-Bazaar EQ supported both playing the game, and 
dealing with players for trades.

So don't. Do exactly as much of it as you enjoy, and no more. The 
problem with EQ is that you *needed* to more of that than you enjoy 
because it was the most efficient way get better gear.

The path of least resistance (most efficient way to upgrade gear) is 
also the least fun == bad game design.

When someone says 'I'm willing to do x for some of it...' that doesn't 
strike me as 'Hey, I want to log in and do x'. What your saying, in my 
view, is that fishing for tribute is stupid, but its the most efficient 
way for you to get tribute so you do it. Wouldn't it be -better- if the 
most efficient way to get tribute was actually fun. Not something you 
were willing to put up with, but something you actually wanted to do, 
something interactive challenging, etc etc...  and yielded as much or 
more tribute than standing by a water body, pressing hotkeyA every 15 
seconds?

Again, the path of least resistance (most efficient accumulation of 
tribute) is the least fun == bad game design.

I actually don't have a problem with pp per se. I think I'd just make pp 
no drop so it wouldn't be part of the player economy. After all you'd 
still need it to buy horses, iron rations, tradeskill items...

Even from an RPG perspective; you walk into an orc camp and slaughter 40 
orcs... would you really strip them naked, and haul every last bit of 
copper, their ragged and beat on armour and weapons, and maybe even some 
body parts (heads, flesh, blood, toes, fingerbones, tibulas...) back to 
town??  

Leaving stuff behind is perfectly rational.

Having said that... in PnP RP when the GM rolls up some loot he's not 
going to put piles of stuff nobody in the party can even theoretically 
use into it. (Nor does he generally let you take your loot to town, and 
just buy godly better loot from a vendor, at least not if he's a half 
decent GM he won't) 

Perhaps EQ needs a similiar tweak... generate the loot based on the 
players killing the mobs, instead of at spawn.  If a bard soloed the 
thing, don't drop cleric only vambraces... If a group of shm, nec, war, 
bst, sk, and clr roll through a dungeon... don't drop bard only helmets.
