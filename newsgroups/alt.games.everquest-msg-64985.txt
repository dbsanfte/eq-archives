i agree with the new models...they rock.  Last night, after FINALLY
getting on i was running around the tunnel, along with a lot of other
people just looking at each other.  There some non luclin people who
were asknig to be described hehe it was really neat.  Also, I love the
way my monk sits, and puts his weapons behind his back, like hes ready
to spring at a moments notice(which of course he is).

I really think the lady's position is a direct ripoff of DAOC, like
the norse women sat(never played another realm).  But not
complainin..its great!

Again i agree.  THe casters should be geeks and with bad posture and
possible cartoon stink lines coming off the necros..xause they are all
stinky like the dead.  Okay maybe not the last one.

There are a few bugs, and I am completely unable to play on the Moon
cause the framerate is soooo horrible.  Peopel said its just the
graphics engine, but Commons etc is okay.  dunno...hope it gets
better.  You would hope a Gig t-bird, 700 megs ram, and a v5 would run
it well at 640 res..but its still jerkier than a geek at his computer
looking at naked pictures of Britney Spears(thats a lot of jerking).

Sushi
whos lovin' luclin!
