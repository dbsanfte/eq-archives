I believe his point was that even before the CHeal change, druids had
a tough time getting in on raids because the only thing they had to
offer a raid group was weak heals, which wouldn't keep someone alive
in a pinch, and now, it'll be even worse for them:

Note that I have no clue about end-game encounters (or even mid-game
encounters :p) so I'm not sure how accurate it is but, considering how
fast I've seen a tank go down on a couple raids I've seen my
brother-in-law participate in, I think I'd be wanting the best
possible heals available too :/
