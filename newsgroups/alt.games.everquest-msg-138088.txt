Hi,

When I was a 35th season shaman I left OT and started hunting giants in
FM.  To a degree I regret this and wish I had stayed in OT a bit longer.
What I'd suggest is just grouping, try to convince them to let you melee,
and work up your offensive while you get exp.  Once you get your first pet
(I forget what level you get it at, is it 34?) you can start considering
soloing.  This will give you less exp, but you'll be able to work up you
defense as you'll get hit A LOT.  One of my favourite place to solo in my
40's were the Yeti caves in DL.

Good luck,

John
