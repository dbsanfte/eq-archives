Dont think you can sue VI just for being addictive.
BUT..
When you play EQ, you dont move around much, since you have to sit and 
play. If you raid alot, youre probably gonna drink lots of coke/coffee, 
and order lot of junk food, cause you dont have time to make dinner.
THEN you sue CocaCola/Pepsi, McDonalds, KFC, Burger King, Dominos, 
whatever other fast food joint you buy from, AND sue Verant for making 
you eat the junk food.
Thats a surefire case.
