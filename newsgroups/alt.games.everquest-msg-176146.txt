Grow up.  leave your home more often.  Talk to people.  Make friends.  Do
normal stuff.  Wash.  Dont masturbate so often.  Develop social graces.  Be
sensitive to others (and then they may be sensitive to you).

But, whatever you do, dont imagine for one minute that anyone gives a fuck
about you.

We all know you're just some sad loser who has no friends and tries to
escape into the internet.

Sad, lonely, irrelevant little person.
