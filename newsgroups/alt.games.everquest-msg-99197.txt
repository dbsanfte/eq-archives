I originally posted under the (mistaken) impression that you were
using your level 18 experience to refute the notion that non-hell
levels had been made harder to compensate for the easier hell ones.

More testing clearly needs to be done; outdoors sub-30 and anywhere
post-30, to determine whether non-hell levels are now easier, the
same, or (as should be) harder than before.

As an aside though, I ran through Runnyeye last night on my way
somewhere else and was very pleased to see level 20+ players in there
again, the way there used to be way back when.  Those arguing (not
saying *you* are) that the recent changes will result in more clueless
level 60's might stop to consider that a plausible argument could be
made that this change will result in *more* players with dungeon
experience, not fewer.  If you're going to get twice the experience in
Runnyeye as you'd get in LoIO, which place would *you* go?

Even *if* it turns out that 1 through 30, 35, 40, and 45 have all been
made easier with no compensating increase in difficulty anywhere else,
I wouldn't consider the game to have been dumbed down by a "huge
amount."  50 to 60 is a good half the game, plus there's the non-hell
levels before 50, and a virtually endless amount of time you can spend
on AAXP.  If the first quarter or even third of the game has been made
significantly easier, I simply don't have a big problem with that.  It
will make my alts' lives easier and may very well have the effect of
hooking the more casual player.  My opinion only, of course; YMMV.  I
should perhaps note that I do not support any further changes (most
particularly not ones to make the high level game easier) and I agree
that we need to be vigilant and make our opinion on this matter clear
to SONY.

I'm afraid I'm in the "It's not like you've won the Purple Heart; it's
a computer game that you played presumably because you enjoyed it, not
as a rite of manhood" camp.  Here we will simply have to disagree, I
guess.

Agreed.
