Well, in all honesty, I learned to drive at 11.  There's no law 
against it on private property after all.  It was even a stick shift. :)

}Or just maybe, the PARENT isn't ready to explain...  :^)

Well, if the parent isn't ready to explain, perhaps Sesame Street can do 
it for them.  Some parents will -never- be ready to explain.  Do you think 
that's good for the child?
