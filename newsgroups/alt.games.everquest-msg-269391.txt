Your analysis is basically correct, perhaps exaggerated just a 
little -- I've been doing a little better soloing for exp than it 
sounds like you have -- but only a little. However that's true 
only if we solely considere adventuring (killing mobs).

The other side of the game -- tradeskilling -- is by definition a 
solo activity, and it's already clear how much richer and better 
developed that is than it was in EQ1. One clever way that it is 
well thought-out is that it successfully involves even players 
like me who have zero interest in actual tradeskilling [the idea 
of spending recreation time virtually fashioning clothing and 
potions via onscreen mouseclicks is to me preposterous]. It does 
this through the harvesting of components for the actual 
tradeskillers.

Tradeskillers need components which must be harvested out in the 
wilds of the gameworld, something which is most easily done 
by...adventurers like me. There is a dizzying variety of such 
components, and knowing that tradeskillers will buy some of them 
for quite high prices makes harvesting into sort of a solo 
treasure hunt for us adventuring-oriented players. When I get into 
a good group, I happily spend an evening adventuring and earning 
experience levels. In between finding nice groups, I'll spend a 
little time exploring the same zones harvesting, finding stuff 
which I then sell and use to buy armor, spells, weapons, etc. So 
I'm getting fun group playtime and fun solo playtime, without 
actually becoming a tradeskiller. And I'm getting popular with my 
tradeskiller clients too, which can't be a bad thing...


P.S. At release, this system had a bottleneck, which was needing 
to level up your harvesting skills in the newbie zones too high in 
order to start harvesting in the real hunting zones. So a couple 
of weeks ago a few key newbie zones were getting crowded with 
20something adventurers doing tedious harvesting in zones where 
all the mobs were grayed out to them. However SOE has quickly 
grasped the problem and cut the Tier 2 harvesting-skills threshold 
  in half, so that harvesting-leveling and experience-leveling now 
advance together more or less -- I am harvesting in and around the 
same mobs that when grouped I hunt for good experience.
