As a warrior... the general rule would be to put the faster weapon in
the primary hand, in other words the first group is right (the second
group is utterly wrong anyways). Each weapon attacks when its own
delay timer is up, utterly independant of the other.

There are exceptions though.

If the two weapons are drastically different in quality, it is usually
better to have the slower, better one in the primary, since dual wield
doesn't always go off. This becomes less pronounced as you get higher
in level (and get better at dual wield). Example: Jagged Longsword (16
30) and Langseax (6 23). The damage is better with the slower JL in
the primary hand.

If you are below about L35, you aren't getting enough double attacks
on the offhand to make it worth a whole lot to put a superior but
slower weapon there. Again, put the superior weapon in the primary
until about L35 or so, maybe a bit higher.

But other than that, it is almost always best to put faster weapon in
primary because 1. you always attack with your primary every round,
you have to succeed with a dual wield roll to attack with your
secondary, and 2. your damage bonus applies only to the primary, so
with two equal ratio weapons, the faster one will do more damage in
primary overall than the slower one.
