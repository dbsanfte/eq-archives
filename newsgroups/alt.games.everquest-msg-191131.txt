Funny how so many bright people can't seem to answer the questions posted.
Somehow all posts end up taking a quick turn off topic and discussing some
pabulum. A couple managed to give me an opinion and I thank them.

Back to the question, if you please.

Tired of quadding ulthorks in the eastern wastes as a 42 druid.

1) Is there any other excitement in EW. I don't want to smack Coldains
around cause of Thurg faction?

2) If not EW solo / quadding location, where would be the next best place
for solo / quadding? Good visibility, plentiful mobs (non-casting hopefully)

Thank you in advance.
