It all depends on the stats of the weapon that you give him.  You probably
gave him a weapon that was really crappy and actually caused it to hit for
less than he would have without the weapon. There are a couple of sites that
will give you the stats of your pet at various levels.  Compare these stats
to the weapon you are giving him.   Unless the weapon is better, don't give
it to him.

This was explained to me when I wanted to know more about the "disarm"
skill.  In some cases you can actually make your situation worse by
disarming a MOB that hits harder and faster without a weapon.  On the other
hand, you can also slow a MOB by giving it a crappy weapon to hit with.

I think this happens with ALL spells that you cast on someone other than
yourself.  You can renew your own "buff" before the first one has worn off,
but when you try this on anyone else it says that they are protected and the
spell did not take.
