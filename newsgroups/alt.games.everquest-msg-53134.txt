You're a moron. You know that, right?

How many people share my name in my city of 2 million people?

The fact that my ISP (one you share, btw) is so fucking stupid that they
send my static IP (I almost never have to reboot) and my city of origin out
with my every single post, against my will, is far more threatening to
myself than the mere posting of my name.

This is Usenet.  It's a public place.  All I've ever done is exchange
commentary with bizbee.
This is Usenet.  Facts and the truth have as much meaning as lies and deceit
do.
This is Usenet.  The "bull" tells the herd what to believe.
This is Usenet.  Herds for the most part consist of slackers and
irresponsible incompetents, who tend to spend their entire day at work (if,
they even have a job) posting to Usenet or doing Google searches on their
latest enemy.

Stating a fact, like, bizbee started it, in an atmosphere such as I've
described, is about as productive as pissing in the wind.
