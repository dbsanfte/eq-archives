So, if I understand you correctly, the universe needs an act of creation 
to exist, but God does not need an act of creation to exist. Every 
effect needs a cause, but God, somehow, does not need a cause himself. 
You have a problem with the universe having always existed, but you do 
not have a problem with god having always existed.

I don't mean to offend, but that's not intellectual limitation, that's 
intellectual laziness. Rather than search for answers, you are just 
shifting all big questions back one place.
