It takes some time. You might get several skill increases in a row, then 
not get any for several swatches. You can also combine 2 spiderling silks

http://www.eqtraders.com/ has a list of places where you can buy various 
trade skill related items.

A large sewing kit has 10 slots (as opposed to 2 for the small one), and 
can be used to make things that require more than 2 items.
