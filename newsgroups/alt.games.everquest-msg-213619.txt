Here are 2 that I use. well one true Parsing progi and a great add on for
EQ.

YALP. 2.3 (374Kb- Small)  from yalp.org

THis wil give you all the info you will ever need.  Alows you to see all
your fights as a whole, or get details about indavidual fight's.  Graphs
damage and lets you look at it as eather How many times you hit for X amount
or how much damage you did at X amount per swing.  Nice for comparing
weapons.

My favorite program. - EQWatcher Evolution from eqwatcher.com.

This is a program that should come with EQ from the begining.  With its add
ons it becomes a very powerful program, but even in its base form it is
great.  It will "speak" using text to speach anything you want.  I have it
set up to tell me when ever someone sais anything in the Guild chat, Group,
Tells, and my Officer Channel.  WIth it set up like this I don't miss
ANYTHING.  Oh and did I mention that it tells damage and DPS after every
fight.  IT even counts YOUR spell damage from DD and Dot's in the final DPS
and TOTAL damage.

I am thinking of making it a prerequisit for our raids...  Let people
consentrate on the raid, not on what is being said.

The add ons are what make it great.  IT tells me about 3 seconds before
shadows fall on my SK, I have it set up to track all the buffs I give out on
my Cleric.  I know 2 minutes before any of the important puffs are going to
fall. It is set up to anounce SLOW's, Root's, MALO, Tash.  And you can set
it up with any triger you would like.  IF it is anounced some where in the
LOG, a triger cn be made to track it.  Randoms where a big problem.  When
you have 20 People doing a /ran it can be tedious trying to find the winner.
And near imposable to catch a cheat.  Well Now i have it set up to tell me
WHo the winner was in any roll seasion, if someone roled more than once, or
if someone changed the ran to /ran 40 -100 to give themselfs an edge.
