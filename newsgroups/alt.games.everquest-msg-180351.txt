It's been a long time since I was over on that side but I think he's
too high for the undertier OT mobs. He wants to be fighting the lower
level of the upper tier. The thornies, the berzerkers, the tigresses,
the rhinos, and the stoneleers.

If he's got KEI or good equipment perhaps he can add spikies,
stonegazers and unbuffed knights to that. I'd still leave tigers and
knights that appear to be moving too fast alone, though. That's just
asking for trouble.
