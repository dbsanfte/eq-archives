I never really read up on this one.  Does it work on mobs like Gaurdian
Wurms in Skyfire?  My brother and I have been hunting them regularly
but the bastages hit with 560's a pop and if I get resisted on a slow
that means the show is over (has only happened once but it was one
time too many :)

On a side note, do you happen to know PC on the cleric spell "Word
of Redemption" I don't see it forsale ever and nobody will give me a
good PC on it.  I've been told everywhere from 10kpp to 80kpp.
(We got this from a GW the other night)

I know you already know this but Quiesensce is down to 40kpp now.
Anyways, does the extra buff duration count on things like Quiesensce
and Torpor?  I wouldn't have thought so because they aren't <really>
a buff, they are a heal.  If it does make them last longer that could be
cool.

I looked at this one but figured it was just a play AA.  I'm more interested
in getting things that are useful right now for XP and raids.  Our guild is
just
starting to get everybody flagged for the Tier 2/3 planes but since a lot of
higher guilds are in PoP, there is talk of us doing some old world raids.
