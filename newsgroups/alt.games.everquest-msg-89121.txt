Heh, I watched an RL friend 48 mage go on a Nagafen kill over the weekend,
there was a 75 person force that wiped out the day before, they went in with
~25, nearly everyone died, he was down to 30% when people started dropping,
all the casters essentially bind rushed with a nuke til he dropped (they
bound in the prep room)  my friend had all his nukes resisted, so he chain
petted, and his pet nearly got the death blow, heheh, he got a gold plated
koshiganata for his troubles, although the raid leader was a gimpy ass
bastard who said, before they cleared the FGs, he was rolling as a warrior
for loot (apparently has a main 56 warrior who needs a scale) and no one
minded, then he rolled with the casters on the satchel and koshi, and was
the only person who beat my friend on the koshi, until my friend mentioned
that he said he was rolling as a warrior, at which point the entire raid
force slapped him and my friend got a gimpy ass dagger.

Not to mention the fact that Rokyl dropped the mask and the person who
looted it was a cleric who decided not to wear it, which annoyed something
like, um, ALL the int casters.
