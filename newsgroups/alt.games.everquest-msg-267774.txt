The only time video games are fun for me is when I am higher then a
kite. I mean really, what can be more fun then taking a gigantic bong
hit and laying the smack down on your friends? Alas, I have quit
smoking weed and have come to the startling realization:

Video games are a complete and utter waste of time. 

Regardless of how much or how little you play games, you have to come
to the realization that you are doing nothing productive but occupying
your pubescent mind with flashy images. It is much like my dog getting
all horny as fuck when it sees the animal planet and so it decides to
mount the couch and pump away like a jack hammer for two hours.

I know some people will try and justify there playing video games as,
"Oh I come home from work, and I work so hard all day and all I want
to do is nuke some commies in a game of blah blah blah". And to those
people I ask you this, have your prior commitments sucked you so dry
of energy that all you can do is stare at a screen and mash buttons?
Don't you have any other things in this life that you want to
accomplish? Don't you realize that you could be doing those things
instead of playing video games?

The worst offenders are players of MMORPG's. Anyone who is past level
thirty of these games has had to of played for hundreds of hours. I
would comment on this complete waste of time but I think that the
general consensus among the sane is that anyone stuck in a fantasy
world for this long has already been deemed a complete ambitionless
soul, attracted to wearing wolf shirts and playing long games of D&D.

Time is precious and I have already wasted too much of it doing drugs,
playing video games, fucking loose bitches, and watching TV. Actually
I take that back, screwing loose bitches was not a complete waste of
time but the hours afterward of me trying to figure out how I was
going to get them out of my house were.


I have sold my PS2 and now all I need to get rid of is my Xbox, get it
here:

Then I will finally have enough money for my new Strat.
