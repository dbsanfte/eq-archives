He does have better options though. For one, he could do nobles/bards
in HHK. All solo pulls at his level yes. He wouldn't need snare and
they wouldn't have a prayer of damaging him past 50%. I do it with
Lori from time to time when I want money and a bit of exp without
having to constantly be at the computer like I would in a group. He
could probably only do three maybe four before they respawn, not as
good as a L50 necro there, but hey he's a soloing warrior, what can
you expect. :-)
