Actually, I think the biggest reason is lots of static spawns with really
fast respawns. The bandit camps can easily hold two groups of six each,
full time, no waiting for a group of L16-19s, or one good group of L23s,
for example. The only place in the old world I get the same kind of rush
from is the Crushbone Throne Room. 3 mobs pop, you jump on them, while
you're handling those, 2 more show up, etc. And the action is almost
nonstop. Compare this to Trainer Hill, where you clear the whole hill then
wait. And wait. For more orcs to show up. Yawn. The fast, fast, fast
spawn/kill rate means xp shoots through the roof, and that's why folks
keep coming back.

Another useful side effect is that, since there are so many adds at PC
(and CB throne room), you can't really solo (ignoring ultra-twinks). You
need to have a full group for heals, nukes, tanking, etc. Anything that
teaches the important skills at low levels is a good thing, IMO :)
