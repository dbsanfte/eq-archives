Hmm...what about tradeskillers?  Haven't they said that being a tradeskiller
instead of an adventurer is supposed to be viable?

Also, if I'm supposed to be out killing monsters, aren't I more likely to do
that if I can find the items I want to buy quickly and then go fight, rather
than having to hang around the city waiting for someone with the item I want
to log in and start selling?

I think they are making a fundamental error here.  If there are items that
they do not want to see easily available for sale, they need to limit those
items from coming into the world too fast in the first place.  Letting the
items in and then trying to limit their circulation by making trading more
difficult is a bad approach.
