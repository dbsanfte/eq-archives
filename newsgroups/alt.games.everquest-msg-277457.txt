Recast time lets you nuke more, cast time means you lose less melee
damage doing it.

For high end rangers (less so beastlords, with pets and all) with very
high end weapon sets they damage gain from nuking, especially on
resisty mobs, was actually less than the damage that would have been
gained meleeing over the cast time. I.e. a nuke that does 240dps with
a 2 second cast when the ranger is doing 350dps with pure melee.

My reducing the cast time, the nuke is still providing the same
damage output per minute, but its interrupting less melee; for a low
end ranger this is pretty much 'no change', as the melee damage lost
in either case would be insignificant compared to the dPS of the nuke.

For a high end ranger its a big change, as it makes the nukes worth
casting; weapons scaled faster than nuke damage.

Its funny really; the two tweaks (recast, and cast time) address
entirely different problems; recast assumes the nuke is a net DPS
gain and lets you cast it *more* to increase that gain, cast time
assumes its a net loss and tries to bring it back positive without
increasing the damage over time of the nuke at all significantly.
