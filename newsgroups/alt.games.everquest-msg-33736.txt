Really you want a server with several "uber" guilds so you have
a choice when you see that some of them are total anal dorks about
how loot is given out and you'd have to be in the guild for 2 years at
every raid to make being in the guild even have a point.
Don't know about all of them but tribunal might be okay in that
regard.

The best classes to pick as main are Shadowknight or cleric. Both can
be pretty fun and cleric is really needed while sk is at least welcome
most of the time. The reason why I select these is that their planes
grade armor is the most plentiful in the old planes and in POG. They
were on their THIRD sets of plane armors while my druid who attended
more raids still did not even have a first. Its just not fufilling to
to be a "great class" when you never get anything in the high level
game, you end up being a "great taxi."
