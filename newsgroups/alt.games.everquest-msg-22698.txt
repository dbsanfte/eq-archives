Thats great! It would be difficult to devise some twisted plan to accomplish
this added portion, but if you could somehow have it hit while they are
underwater, it would be brilliant... They might not even realize the reason
they are drowning quickly enough to save themselves. But how can you get
some beggar to join you then jump into water deep enough to drown... Perhaps
claim your corpse is there and there is money and equipment on it he can
have then give him corpse permission? Hrmm... Maybe... Or maybe its
impossible. Whatta thing tho if it ever worked.
