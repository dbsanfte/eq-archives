Decent low end HP regen would be an Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2025 . Maybe better out
there these days but this is getitng relatively cheap.

A horse , well mount anyway, not sure about those other things that flop all
over the place. Constant medding and no sit down aggro = a great twinkage
item for a low end caster. My level 6 enchanter with 188 Charisma paid 8.3K
for the base model. Of note that the bridles you buy are no drop and I could
not sell it back either so don't purchase till your sure you like the
character and will be staying on it. The other no brainer is a Earing of
Solstice:
