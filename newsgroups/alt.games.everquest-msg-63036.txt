700 to 900 quads aren't too bad.  For a top end mob (remember, this is
suppose to compete near head to head with AoW), those hits are
reasonable.  A main tank can actually survive for a couple of round of
combat unlike the pre-nerf AoW where it was simply impossible for a
main tank to tank even a single round effectively.

We'll let you know tomorrow--assuming the whiny ass high/wood elves in
the guild don't suddenly find a family emergency that forces them to
be offline...."Oh shit, my cat just coughed up a hairball!  Gotta go,
bye."
