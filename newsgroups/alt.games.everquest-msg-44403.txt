1. last night I was running from oasis to sro on CR, no agro, got within
50ft of zone and lost 4 bubbles of hp with no spell cast on me and no hits
registered against me....... 1 bubble hp left and i hit zone, pc hangs, have
to restart eq and find i'm dead.

2. im on CR for the above mentioned corpse and heading through oasis to sro,
i notice theres no corpse there, so i zone into sro and find i'm down to 1
bubble hp left again, no text notification of a spell or melee against me

i have no idea wtf is going on
