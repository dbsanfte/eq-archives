As someone who has just started playing Everquest here's my beginner's
guide:

1. Read the manual.  Really.  This is important.  Most games you can just
glance at the manual later to pick up the points that you missed.  With
Everquest you're going to feel like you don't know what to do and even if
you knew what to do you wouldn't know how to do it.  You're not going to
figure out how to effectively use the interface without it (and it will be
fristrating).

2. Do the tutorial.  Unfortunately my 'classic' 9.99 CD doesn't install the
tutorial properly.  So it wasn't there.  (and the 9.99 version doesn't come
with a printed manual, just the pdf on the CD).  Ended up buying the Trilogy
version for a friend, and saw the tutorial.  Woudl have made life 1000 times
easier.

2.a Since I didn't have a printed manual and the tutorial didn't load, I
bought the 'players guide' ($14.99).  So I'll comment a little on it.  1-
it's not a replacement to the manual.  2- it's written in EQ-speak (with
glossary) but some parts you sorta have to read twice.  (Look at some posts
on here for exaples of EQ-speak).  3. - It's more of a 'light reference'
then a players guide.  It doesn't really help you out too much with what you
need to do.  The character creation sections, maps, spell and skill guides
per class are helpful to have printed out.  (I'm sure you can get better
versions of this info from the net tho).

3. The goal in the game is to get mad skillz, phat loot and a lot of bling
bling by killing things.  That's it - simple goal - kinda like everyday
life.

And if you want to playj ust buy the trilogy version.  Don't screw around
with the $10 box.  The $10 box didn't install right on two systems (no
tutorial, and weird errors) doesn't come with a printed manual and doesn't
come with the expansions.  The expansions are hard to find separate and are
going to cost more than $20 anyway.  You also get a pretty worthless map and
a goofy set of figures.  (The manual says you get a cloth map, but they
lie!)
