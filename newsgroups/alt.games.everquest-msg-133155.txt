Sorry if I wasn't clear - during the killing is when I meant theres no real
healing going on (and certainly no backup healing going on).. the key is to
kill the mobs asap, before people start going oom.

In every AE group I've done (excluding wipeouts) the only person to die has
been a puller (wizard)
On our 55mob acrylia pull, the 3 chanters were happily chain stunning and
taking little to no damage.

Aego I guess.  Casting time of heals?  Remedy is generally good enough a
heal.. whats a druids cast time for 400 or so hp?

Well an AE group is built around wizards.. so transportation, evacs, TL's
etc are already there.

1 cleric, 2 enchanters, 1 druid, 2 wizards (preferably with epics so they
can pull)

In an optimal group there is no place for a druid or melee.. but a guildie
druid has joined ae groups on a lot of occasions (optimal isnt such a high
criteria when its a guildie/friend I guess)
