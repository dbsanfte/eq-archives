Possibly...
But my comment of playing style maybe the difference between how I view the
game and how others see it.
I have played EQ since Early 2000, my Main was born February 2000  (wasn't
my first character)
and he's only 55th level with about 9AA pnts...Give you some idea how much
the end game of EQ interested me.

Oh, and No, you C(an't)HMS...even if you were BB :p
I said I'm cancelling the payments to my accounts, not quitting. As you say,
in a month or so....who knows.
I don't see me returning to EQ but I have actually cancelled them a before
and in about 6weeks was playing them again.

Think I will sell up tho'
Who knows what goodies there'll be to buy when if I return, and my Cobby BP
will prolly be worth about 10k by then :)
