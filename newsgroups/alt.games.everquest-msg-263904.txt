Just as a side note. You can reach CS via PoM. Just zone into PoM and
head north I believe. Click arount on the wood until you get the you are
to far away...message. Once you aren't to far anymore you will be portet
to CS. Be sure to have an enduring breath spell/item as the zonein point
is underwater.
