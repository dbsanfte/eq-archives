    Unless you have the Sprinkler. First priority is all Sprinkler-equipped
clerics.

    My order, assuming no res sticks, and assuming people have been dead
long enough to re-mem spells and songs, has always been as follows:

Bard, who can both mez and clarity without any mana. Also has a healing song
to help with post-res recovery, and an invis song for areas with high
hostile traffic.
Enchanter, to max out the mana recovery of me and every person I res from
this point on.

-All other clerics, to get the ressing done ASAP.
-Depending on how hostile the area is, I may do whoever can protect the CR
team before we're done CR. This could be tanks, it could be additional
mezzers, it could be a kiter.
     The order of those two depends strongly on the safety of where we are.

Necromancers, for mana dumps and for possible corpse summons of "lost"
folks.
Mages, for mod rods.
Druids, Beastlords, Rangers, Paladins, Shadow Knights, Wizards, remaining
Bards, remaining Enchanters.
Shamans.
Warriors, Rogues, Monks.

    I assume I camped out and lived. If I died, then I pick up at whatever
point the surviving cleric has left off at once I arrive and get my mana
going. Shamans are near-last because with the other healers beginning to get
to FM, they can just chain-Cannibalize with people healing them to get to
FM. If the SHM in question has Torpor, they don't even need other people.
The only reason they aren't last is because they usually have a ton of buffs
to do as well.

    James
