Yep. Pretty snazzy too, considering how trivial and cheap they are to
make (assuming, of course, you have a maxed out master fisherman and
somebody to fletch that stupid tool for you. (Not that hard to find.)

Thus far the problem as been getting the fish without getting attacked
by moat mobs.  With all the patch login problems, there was almost
nobody in KC when I stopped in there to fish last night, and I kept
getting jumped by the bastards every fourth or fifth cast.

Need to find a better place to stand. I was on Left Ledge, most of the
way back. I wonder if there's other ledges away from wandering mobs that
I could levitate and run over to?
