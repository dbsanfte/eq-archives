Just the word "censor" (even when spelled correctly) is far more offensive 
to me than any of the words many of us spout on a regular basis.

It is not my job to babysit someone else's kids. Nor, for that matter, do I 
feel there is anything wrong with the "naughty words" you are talking 
about. How is "shit" and worse than "poop"? The only reason it has the 
power to be profane is because we have arbitrarily assigned profanity to 
it.
