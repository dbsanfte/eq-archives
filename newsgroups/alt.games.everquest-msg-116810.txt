What is the EverQuest Legends Target Reservation System? 

It's a service provided with your Legends subscription to allow fair
play and
planning for higher end content of EverQuest. 

What does a guild need to do to be part of the reservation system? 

The ability to be part of the reservation system will involve passing
the 
appropriate Trial of Heroes for the Tier your guild wishes to be part of
and
sending in the required reservations requests and weekly reports. 

What days can you reserve a target on the system? 

The reservation system will begin on Wednesday when the server comes
live
(or 12 Noon Pacific, whichever is applicable) and will end on Saturday
evening
at 11 PM Pacific. 

What happens on days not recognized by the reservation system? 

From Saturday after 11 PM Pacific until Wednesday at 12 Noon Pacific,
all listed
targets will be viewed as "free for all". Any spawn disputes during
these times
will be handled in accordance with the Play Nice Policies as normal. 


There is more in the FAQ.
