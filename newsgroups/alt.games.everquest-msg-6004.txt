I hope this is your last off topic post and you can get some resolution.
I'm not here to flame you because I agree with a lot of your notions, but it
would be nice if we could stay on the topic of Everquest.

I can see why people think badly about a certain group of the veterans to
this newsgroup because they are quick to flame.  I feel for you and anyone
else that the veterans have flamed.  They really should be nicer than what
they are.  But really, be the bigger man and walk away.  There is no point
in beating a dead horse.  They are too fucking stubborn to change and the
best thing you can do for the sake of everyone is to stop the pointless
bickering with them.  Their repution speaks for themselves with every dumb
ass post they make, and that goes for everyone.  You think you are right and
they think they are right, please leave it at that.  Let's not make this a
contest of who gets the last word in.  Can't we all just get along and have
peaceful conversations, hopefully related to EQ.
