That is where probably where I am going to hit up next, now that I have my
spells and @ 30pp in the bank (for some better armor), Im going to give
ita shot.  I was also thinking of hitting up befallen.  The zone is
usually pretty empty, and undead go down quickly.  Who knows, Ill try both
and see how it flys.
