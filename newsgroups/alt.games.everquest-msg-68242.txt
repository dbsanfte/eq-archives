foremans tunic probably
hero bracer can be worn by them (got one)
Gatorscale legs
ulthork arms if they can wear

Not sure if a haste item is worth it, your pet will be the main damage
dealer/tank probably. If you got a haste belt I'd go for swirspine
with like 17 percent haste and 4 ac (that one from kedge) I don't
think it sells for as much as an FBSS does but I like it more. Or I
guess there are haste handwraps now that are cheap if you can use
them.
