First a little DirectX background...

When programming in directX, all images (textures, backgrounds, buttons,
etc...) are drawn on Surfaces in your video memory.  A full screen app (such
as EQ) manipulates the color pallete, resolution, etc. when using its
surfaces.  When you alt-tab out, the program must yield all those surfaces
back to windows.  Then when you alt-tab back in, the program must redraw all
those surfaces before it'll be able to draw on the screen.

EQ programmers did not put this code in.

There is a workaround.  If you set it so that you run in > 640x480, but
leave the other widow at 640x480, then switching between the two causes the
program to force a redraw.  So, I can alt tab out, do what I need, alt-tab
in, hit F10 3 times (to go from regular, to no-interface, to Hud (640x480),
and back to regular) and have my screen back.

The only drawback is that everytime you open a spell book, it must change
resolutions, so it can get a little cumbersome in game.
