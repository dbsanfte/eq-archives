<snip base message>

And note also the new Focus effect potions. Not quite sure what these do yet
(Poison Awareness II?) but I would imagine they will be somewhat symmetrical
with current Focus Effects in terms of spell adjustments. The note on
EQTraders states that they stack with other focus effects, so I guess some
of these already exist or are perhaps avilable in new spells.

The wormwood component for the illusion spells is actually cheap and
storebought (on the order of 1-2p) so expect to see racial confusion abound!

A big ooc: w00t! and attaboy for a dev team that appears to be listening to
its players.
