Have you gone to HHK to get your L12 pet?  Enchanter animations are
relatively weak to begin with, if you are still using the L8 pet it's
like a L12 warrior wearing cloth armor and using the newbie shortsword*.

Are you expecting other players to drop what they're doing and help
you, possibly to the disadvantage of their groups?  It's hard to say
for sure from your post, but it sounds like what you need to do is
to join and contribute to groups, rather than expecting others to
keep watch over you and fix your boo-boos.  If I'm misreading what
you're trying to say I apologize.

You've gone from the easiest to solo class to one of the trickiest to
solo.  The difference between playing a 52 Druid and a lowbie Enchanter
is huge, it's really kinda silly to compare them directly.

Probably.  But, if you work on learning it and group as much as
possible you will have opportunities for fun play that're far
different from what you've likely experienced playing your Druid
(mostly/exclusively solo with the Druid, I'm guessing, correct?).

Casters Realm has some stuff for every class.  Not everything is
correct, and it is hardly complete, but it's a lot better than
nothing (and since it started as an Enchanter site it should have
fairly good info on playing one).
