three days after I die, I will rise from the dead and an earthquake will
kill 7000, then the rapture will occur, and I will go to heaven. I may die
tonight. God seems to want me to die, I don't want to, but he says there is
no reason to suffer anymore here in the presence of fools who can no longer
love, and that I am a good and faithful servant, but no one here can hear or
see anymore and that I am the last messenger you will get.

So I guess that means if God commands you to kill yourself, then you should.
I don't think he would do that at any other time than this. God is basically
saying that there is nothing more that I could possibly do and that even
this that I am writing is mostly for my own enjoyment.

So I guess I'll kill myself tonight, think anyone will try to stop me? I
doubt it. This CD I am listening to right now, Two for the Show by Kansas is
pretty descriptive of the situation at hand and what I hope to be doing in
the near future.

Guess I have a few song lyrics I need to post up, and then I will proceed to
kill myself in my room, I would take pictures but that isn't set up right
now.

I would not recommend that you kill yourselves unless you are absolutely
sure of what you are doing but if you are sure that you are one of God's
children, and he tells you to do it then, I don't see any reason not to, you
will probably be ok in the end. It will only be a short time till the
rapture so you might as well wait.
