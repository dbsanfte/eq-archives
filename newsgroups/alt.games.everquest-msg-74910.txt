Don't take it too hard. 

Many of us (those that have played EQ for a long time) have had to
deal with beggars. You will find very few players willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt. We are all too jaded. The longer you play
the more you will become jaded yourself. Don't be surprised if a
beggar hits you up for money or gear even at level 4-5. If you
were/are not a beggar the comment did not apply to you, so don't sweat
it.

Your original post looked like it could be coming from a beggar trying
to get something for nothing (ie transported back to GF and rebound).

I am sorry to hear that the higher level player tricked you and left
you stuck far from home. The good news is that there are more "good"
players than jerks in EQ. 

If the zone you are currently in is fairly safe, you can ooc or shout
for help. BE POLITE and do not beg. Try something like....

/ooc Need assistance getting home to Greater Feydark. I was tricked
into coming to this zone.

/ooc I was the victim of a dirty trick. Can anyone kindly transport me
back to GF?

Look up the zone you are currently in at www.eqatlas.com
It is possible that the Druid did you a favor. If there is a Guild
hall nearby that you can train and buy spells at, and good hunting for
your level, you could stay where you are.

Cheers
