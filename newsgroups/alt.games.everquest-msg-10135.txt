I'd love to get a pair for my 24 enchanter and I have the cash,
but I have a few questions I haven't seen answered:

1)  Where, exactly, do you buy these?  What zone, what vendor,
    what loc?  Is it going to be impossible to get there at
    level 24?

2)  How long does the effect last?  A normal SoW lasts 30 to 40
    earth minutes, how much shorter is the Tboots effect?

3)  I realize the Tboots effect is slower than SoW, but by how
    much?  Has anyone performed any benchmarks?

Thanks very much!
