SWG had something similar.  You could set up 'groups' to put each person
in the friends list into.  I had four, Guild, Business Partner,
Customer, Enemy.  That made it easy to see exactly who was what.

People requested this on the main forums, but a lot of (short-sighted)
people shot down the idea saying that if you need a field to tell you
who your friends are, they aren't really friends.  I love the idea and
didn't use it just for friends (as you can tell from the categories I
used).
