Here's an interesting thingy - amazon.com state the release date as
15th November.  amazon.co.uk state 12th November.  If this is a case
of us Euros getting in first I'll have a heart attack..

As an aside - are they going to allow us to download the client a la
City Of Heroes?  I would doubt it with the potential no. of units
involved, but just curious.
