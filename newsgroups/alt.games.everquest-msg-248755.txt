Whoa whoa whoa...first you start off by saying "if EQ2 destroys EQ I, and
many others, will leave".  OK, following you so far.  My husband is
bordline "I'll never play another SOE product" himself.

But then you talk about all these failure's on the part of EQ...and they
are none of them a direct byproduct of EQ2.  Maybe they are due to budget
allocations by SOE, but these things...they started happened SO long ago,
before we had even heard about EQ2, that I find it hard to believe that
they are all the fault of SOE dreaming up a sequel.  

I do agree they should have named it something new.  My reasons are
different from yours, of course. I would like it because then folks would
stop making so many gorramit assumptions about the classes and game
mechanics due to their EQ-L experiences.
