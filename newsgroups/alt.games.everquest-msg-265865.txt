Cool. So when it says the most specialized class can be Good OR Evil
(such as Wizard, Warlock, Fury, Dirge, etc), does that mean I can
serve either city?

I kinda want to try Warlock but my friend prefers the non-drab look of
Qeynos and I was worried Warlocks would have to be evil. I'm hoping
his city preference (he doesnt care about alignment) and my class
preference will mesh.

I'd like to be a Necromancer too but I guess I'll have to make an evil
toon for that for sure.
