This is where I did it.  I did spend time in LOIO too, and sure, the
experience is better there.  But on balance, SK is the better way to go I
think, and will feel like it went by faster.  Kind of like 2 hours watching
a good movie go by faster than 20 minutes at the dentist.

There always seem to be a few people (or a few groups) camping the aviak
town, and they were, in my experience, willing to help each other out of a
jam.  You'll still occasionally hear /oocs and /shouts of "stop pulling my
spawns" coming from the folks camping the spires, but it is far less rampant
than at LOIO.
