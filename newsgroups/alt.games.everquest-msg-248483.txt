It was possible in the past for an Everquest account to have a separate
password apart from the rest of the Station. Sony switched to a new login
server which uses the Station password. If the Station and old Everquest
passwords were different, it replaced the EQ password with the Station
password.

You will need your friend to login to the Station website and change their
password from there. It will then work for the new EQ login.

And no, you can't go back to the old login unless you happened to keep the
old everquest.exe before it got patched over. It would most likely fail to
work after the next server patch anyway.
