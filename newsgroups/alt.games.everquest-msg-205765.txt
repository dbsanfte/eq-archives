poor guy, those basilisks are a pain to kill, you are lucky you got 
away. One time when my first character was still low, I tried a 
basilisk, it kept stunning me between taking big hunks outta me and I 
didn't even get one hit on it.  Some of the newbie quests can be done at 
low levels but usually you can't complete it before 12 or so unless you 
get some good groups.  Don't worry about finishing it if you can't. 
What I'd do is tailor some armor and use that instead, ruined wolf pelts 
are great for that.  When you get higher level, there's woodelf cultural 
tailoring you should look up, might be worth your time to make.
What server you on and what is your character name?
