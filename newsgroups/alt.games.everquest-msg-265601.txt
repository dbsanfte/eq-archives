D&D Online looks like it's going to be much like Guild Wars, in that
it has a common town but all adventures happen in group-instanced
zones.  Quoting from
http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/dungeons-dragons-online/536083p2.html:

'The key to this are instanced dungeons. [...] While this means that
groups of players will never encounter other parties while "on the
field" [...]'

I'm disappointed, even if this is closer to how tabletop D&D tends to
work than more "traditional" MMORPGs.


> Shame Warhammer online was cancelled :((

Climax claims it's not quite dead yet.  GW has pulled out but Climax
aren't giving up just yet.
