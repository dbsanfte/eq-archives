Actually, that's just the first correlation. You can correlate to hit 
point regeneration too in exactly the same manner.

Its not quite as obvious or clean because you have less direct control 
over hitpoint expenditure, and for a the pure casters with no canni 
there is a bit of a dead spot in the conversions if they aren't taking 
hits in a fight... but if they are taking dots, aoes, or enough hits to 
keep their hitpoints a 'relevant concern' it works out for them too.

By the way that hitpoint dead spot isn't limited to the hp correlation 
its no different then the dead spot that manifests for mana in a pure 
melee group... like monk,monk,rog, rog, warr where mana is simply not a 
factor.

Now the the interesting part is that both mana and hps are linked to 
time, and so is the dps of both the mob and the party... and that, not 
mana regeneration is the true universal currency.

For example, when you decide 'to nuke or not to nuke' to optimize you 
have to ask the question will the 'downtime' reduced as a result of an 
extra 1000 damage make up for the downtime incurred as a result of 
having to regen this mana.  Clearly that is not a trivial 
question...many factors relative dpses, gear, the presence or abscense 
of various classes (healers, nukers, etc), the odds of respawns/adds, 
all play a part. But the real currency is time, not mana, although there 
is a correlation between them.

The old maxim time is money adapts... time is damage, mana, and hitpoints.

Finally, the good news is that your bard doesn't *always* have to sing 
manasong to be optimal. In many cases the bard mezzing, dotting, dssing, 
even slowing etc will have a greater effect than manasong. Although in a 
caster heavy group indirect downtime reduction as a result of manasong 
can become overwhelming.
