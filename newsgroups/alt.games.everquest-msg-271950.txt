I'm not sure what the Rangers have as a compliment to these skills, but
there should be something there.  We have Survival Instincts which
raises your parry skill while dropping your attack speed and Lethal
Resolve which raises your parry, strength and something else (dodge
maybe?) while decreasing attack speed even more (and they stack).  I
fire those off and then Bleeder's Talent (attack speed and agility
buff) and Friendly Shadows (agility buff - might be more included).  I
tend to dodge and parry quite a bit, but things that hit (especially
the specials like Wild Swing and Barrage) tend to hurt a LOT.

I have a few sayings in those situations... "Puddle with a tail
incoming!" and if I survive "Me getting aggro makes healers cry".  It
also tends to make the rest of the group nervous, since the vast
majority of my damage is dealt from behind  If I am trying to dump
aggro I will actually turn off auto-attack to try to lose aggro faster
and increase my parry/dodge chances (thus killing any damage I do
outside of riposte).
