I agree with all of the above.

As I've pointed out elsewhere, the "logical perspective" perspective
you refer to requires additional assumptions to be valid, primarily
that God is bound as we are by time (this notion is rejected by the
Bible, btw).

Why is it shameful to study the thoughts and ideas of those who have
made the spiritual journey before you?  Why is it shameful to gather
in community with people who share many of your beliefs and converse
with one another about these beliefs and spiritual journeys?  Why is
it shameful to study the (now written) oral histories and myths of
the past, to seek spiritual experience in common ritual, to ponder
the power of teachings that were able to survive the challenge of
generations of corrupt leaders?

Are you ashamed to be an EQ player, wasting the mind God gave you
that's capable of imagining and creating for itself intricate
fantasies without the influence of an obviously self-interested
corporate machine?
