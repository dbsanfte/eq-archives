I did most of each of 63-64 and 64-65 in single days of exp grinding in POV.  It
took me longer than that because I wasn't flagged for POV/POS, so I tried
getting exp in lesser zones and it was very slow, then I blew off exping, played
alt and only ran cleric on raids and so forth.  Once flagged, getting to 64 was
a breeze.  Then I raided a few more days, (again, nothing generated noticable
exp) and took one day in POV to level to 65.

Yes, the Exp requirements for 64 and 65 are extreme, but the exp generated in
POV/POS is also extreme.

BOT doesn't. POI factory doesn't.  Nothing I've done in any of the tier one
zones does.  For SURE nothing I've ever done outside POP does... well except
paladul, but I mean at 63+. I'm not flagged for any other POP zones (well TT,
never been there) though, and if the exp is better there, well thats nice for AA
purposes, but if your goal is to get to 65 fast and you aren't in an uber guild,
the trials stumbling block is the only one you need to pass, and even that is
single group.

I imagine that in a more high powered guild that the game does open back up once
you get more flags, but before it opens up, it contracts to two zones.  BOT
isn't any worse than POV, so I guess I'm up to three zones now... on the other
hand, spectrals only drop with regularity in BOT (of the zones I can get to) so
in a way I'm now contracted down to One zone!
