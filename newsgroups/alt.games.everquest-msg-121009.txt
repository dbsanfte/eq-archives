    Casting level-appropriate spells isn't the big part of the new changes,
as the mobs still cheat at this (the sub-60 wizard mobs in Ssra cast the
level 60 Sunstrike, for example). What's really changed is the way NPCs
decide to cast spells. Before, you try to pull mob X and it would cast some
random spell on you, then chase. Now, mobs will try to snare/root a puller.
Mobs are also casting resist debuffs - I'd never seen a shaman mob cast
Mal-line before the patch.
