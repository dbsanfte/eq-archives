Are you sure you've seen them on fizzles? When my shaman first got
Invisibility (and for quite a while thereafter), I was too lazy to do
the "chain cast cheap spell" trick, so instead I fizzled and fizzled
and fizzled and... You get the point. Anyway, I never ever saw a skill
raise even when fizzling 30 times in a row, but I usually got a skill
raise as soon as I successfully cast the spell until I got to skill
level 20 or 30 or something like that. This is represents probably at
least 500 fizzles where I did pay close attention to the skillups.

So if you can get skillups on fizzles, it must be exceedingly rare, or
the RNG just plain hates me, or I've missed them all. I'd check my
logs, but I'm at work so I don't have them available.
