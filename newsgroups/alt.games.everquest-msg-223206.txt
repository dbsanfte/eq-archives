It's become very apparent over my life that other people don't see the
world the way I do.  The difference going from contacts to glasses is
enormous - when I put glasses on everything is smaller, and appears 
farther away.  Changing to contacts everything got bigger and closer.

The right eye is really interesting - the left half of the eye chart is
fairly sharp (at the 20/40 line) but as I read right the letters get breaks
in the lines.  Apparently this is caused by the heavier striation in
the left side of the eye (my left).  By the time I get to the far right
of the 20/40 line, the letters are completely unreadable.

Good luck with the project - unfortunately the chances of a trip to 
Norway (or anywhere in the near future) are slim.  (quit old crappy
job to finish a new degree and am still looking for new not-crappy
job to pay off school debts :-)

Otherwise I'd love to do something like that.  Until recently I haven't
had great experiences with Opthamologists being forthcoming about the nitty
gritty of what's up with my eyes. 

On my dad's side, my family was involved in a family glaucoma study (I 
don't have it) and on my mom's I have the x-linked myopia.  Additionally,
by the time my mom's father was in his 60's he had other vision 
disorders, including macular degeneration.  He was incredibly glare
sensitive (he wore dark glasses in any "normal" light conditions).

So, I have a vested interest in vision disorders, genetic linkage and a
good relationship with a doctor who'll treat me like an intelligent person,
capable of understanding these things.
