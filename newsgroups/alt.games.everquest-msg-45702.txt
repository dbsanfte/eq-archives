Being a 11th lvl. Barbarian shaman, i was told to go on wisp hunting, as 
the exp and the loot was good for my lvl.

Now, as the wisps requires a magical weapon, i was also told that a 
Runed Totem Staff, was a good weapon to go hunting.

The problem being, where to get the staff. I haven't seen it anywhere.

Any suggestions. Thanks for any help possible.
