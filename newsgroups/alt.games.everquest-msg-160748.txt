In over a year of raiding Kael on and off, I have *never* seen an armor
drop off the wimpy frost giant types near the zone lines. I have seen
exactly *one* armor drop off a giant near the bank. Most all the amrmor
drops came from the Arena or the Riff house.

And to the OP... your chances of soloing even the bank giants are
somewhere between slim and none... and I just saw Slim packing his bags.
