I'm a former EQ1 player, quit a couple months ago after 5 years and 
several high level characters.  After a couple months off, I'm thinking 
about getting back into playing, and thought I'd start the research as 
to which to go with.

I want a game where I can solo and group to reasonably high levels; it 
doesn't have to be great (I was happy enough soloing a cleric any level 
up to 62 or berserker any level up to 57 in EQ1, so it doesn't have to 
be great... but it can't feel like dead stop either)

I want a game with quests, real quests that are engaging and yeild 
worthwhile rewards; EQ1 failed miserably here, despite having "quest" in 
the name, there really weren't all that many quests for any given 
character (having 10 quests for each of 10 classes for each of 10 races 
is NOT the same as having 1000 quests, for any given character its the 
same as having 10 quests)

I want a game with tactical options to it, where with thought I can 
apply the tools each class has to find new solutions to combat, and 
combine the tools of several classes into even more new solutions.  I 
-like- figuring out new plans and trying them.  EQ1 had this in spades, 
if you looked for it, even 5 years in to the game we were still 
stumbling across new uses for spells... or discovering that a new 
situation made a tactic we'd discarded three years ago suddenly the 
perfect approach.

On the flip side, as EQ1 leveled up it tended to leave fewer options; 
they made most mobs stun immune, many snare immune, fear immune, and so 
on; this was a boring idea; while there should be -some- mobs immune to 
any given tool, to encourage variety in approach, it shouldn't be 
necessary to discard perfectly good tactics for -all- encounters, 
presenting fewer tools leads to fewer different approaches, and makes 
things get boring faster.

I'm leaning towards EQ2, based on what I've heard, because it vaguely 
resembles EQ1, which had a lot of ideas I liked, and because it seems to 
have a robust quest environment.

On the other hand, I'm also leaning away from it, because I've heard 
there aren't many tactical options, that it rapidly becomes pointless to 
solo, and because, to be frank, it vaguely resembles EQ; I spent 5 years 
in the old version of Norrath, perhaps something entirely different, 
instead of just somewhat different, is in order.

On the gripping hand, I've tried Warcraft III and don't care for the 
game or the graphic style; how interested am I going to be in a MMOG 
based on that?  I've heard COH has a short play life, with game play 
being largely the same at 40 as it is at 10.  I've heard nothing good 
about SWG.  So whats left, other than waiting a few years for Vanguard 
to come out?
