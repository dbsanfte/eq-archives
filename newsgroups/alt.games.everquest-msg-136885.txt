Yep Yep Yep...

Special rights....

If you punch a loudmouth in a bar, it's simple assault..

If he turns out to be gay, it all of the sudden becomes a Federal
Felony and a Hate Crime...

Special rights....

Anyone who watches JAG, there was a real good episode that deals with

And before anyone spouts off about it being only a TV show, JAG has
dramatized real-world events on many occasions...
