Not at all, my theory is that at very -low- levels the backstab should
slant noticably towards the higher damage weapon.  As you've noted,
the benefit of damage bonus to the normal damage on a per swing
basis should give a substantial boost to the faster weapon for higher
level characters.

Strangely, your figures continue to contradict the theory that
the damage bonus substantially outweighs the backstab factor...
even at level 60 the faster weapon is remaining neck and neck
with the slower but bigger one.  Obviously the backstab factor
is making a bigger difference than either of us would have
expected; with a warrior the difference would lean -heavily-
towards the faster weapon with the same ratio.

Another example of Verant training us wrong at a young age.

The difference in delay is larger than 20 to 25, but the difference in
damage is also larger, from 6 to 9.

Bloodstained Fang: 9/32 piercer (ratio 5.94)
Dragoon Dirk: 6/23 piercer (ratio 5.65)
also, I recently acquired another weapon which might tip the balance
Tombcarver: 5/17 piercer (ratio 6.47)

By your theory, the 5/17 should be substantially better at higher
levels, and possibly even at lower (sub 28) ones.

Skill cap only goes up by 5 per level, hardly something that takes long
to hit.  I am using a gnoll hide lariat as my secondary weapon in the
vain hope of improving 1hs... which isn't paying off but is making
the climb up from 1 point fairly rapid for dual weild.  I suppose it
would make sense to swap in the Tombcarver to further pump
dual weild, and soon dual attack.... and when I hit dual attack
level,  to move to tombcarver/lariat so as to get that pumping as
quickly as possible, for a level or two.

A tank that was willing to put weapons other than piercing into
his primary slot would benefit more from the higher speed, since
he'd be trying to cap out -numerous- skills all at once.
