   So everyone who has a vagina is biased?  Thanks for clueing me in.  Please
tell me, are people who have penises instead of vaginas unbiased?

     Sure I do.  I read his post.  That's a pretty big fucking clue.  But only a
clue.  I doubt that his account is 100% true and unbiased.  And, also, in
several places I say that I think the woman has issues a well.  But I am pretty
sure that LG's are bigger.  I might be wrong, though.  If Winterstorm were to
post a long, rambling, self contradictory post seeking sympathy and trying to
inflict damage on LG, I might very well think she is as unbalanced as he is. 
Even if she does have a vagina like me.

   Um.. EQ isn't the problem here.  This is about a couple of dweebs who were
playing the game.  This sort of thing goes on in chatrooms that have no
connection to EQ at all, you know.

   That I agree with.  And I never said different.

> The woman made mistakes like Lonely Guy.

Again, full agreement here.  

Oh no, I agree with someone who has a penis!  Bad vagina!  Bad!

Nice first post, btw.  Welcome to usenet.
