Ah, yet another person tries out Lake of Ill Manners and finds it full
of assholes and not a fun place to play. Welcome to the club. I can't
stand that zone. You do have some other options at that level, though.

My personal favorite at 20 would be to go to High Pass and fight in the
orc groups at the Kithicore zone line until you make 22 or 22, then go
into HighKeep and you can fight there to 30.

You could also go to Ocean of Tears and solo the gargoyles on haunted
island. (Darn good money to be had, as the gargoyle eyes are stackable
and sell for up to 9 plat each to merchants.)

S.Karanas is also a popular choice, particularly for you kiting types,
as it's a huge, wide open zone with a *wide* range of mob levels. At
your level you could doubtless do either the elephants or elephant calf
herds (Don't recall what levels they run) Aviak Dartars, and probably
some of the undead at the skeleton camp near the NK bridge zone.  Once
you get up a few levels higher there, you can hunt in aviak town or at
the Paw Spires, and later on, in Paw itself.

I haven't been there myself yet, but I'm told that the Warrens on Odus,
followed by the brand new Stonebrunt Mtsn. has lots of game appropriate
to your level.
HTH.
