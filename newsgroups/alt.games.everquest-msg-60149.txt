Since I haven't yet played the game at the high end, I don't know
enough about the entire leveling curve to speak to that point. Which,
I guess, is another difference between you and I - you're more than
happy to pontificate about the specifics of a game you haven't played.

At the low end, though, my experience has been that DAoC levels go by
about as fast as EQ levels.


No matter what, it seems to me an odd comparison to make. What are
levels except for arbitrary points set along an experience curve? As
your levels change, so do your various abilities. The only valid
comparison to make is "are the abilities at a given level appropriate
to the challenges at that level". And in both games, IMO, the answer
is Yes.
