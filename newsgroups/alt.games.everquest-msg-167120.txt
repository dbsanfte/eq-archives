What about specialization?  I've never put any points into that because I've
never known what exactly it is, and all the info I've read (CastersRealm)
says you get ONE chance to specialize on ONE area.  Also all guides I've
read are written as if they are only meant to be read by people who have
played a caster into their high LVs many times.
