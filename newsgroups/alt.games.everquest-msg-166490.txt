You really think so?  When I borrow my roommates wizard to port me I'm always
terrified I'm going to get him killed hitting the wrong key - or worse, get me
killed.  I don't do it very often and I never use him for any other reason.
You learn your spells, what they look like, how they work, through trial and
error and experience.  Warrior tactics the same way.
Give a newb with no military / arms training in top armor and give him great
weapons and drop him in a high level war zone how long do you think he would
last?   Would you want him in your group?  Protecting your spellcasters?  
Worse:  would you want him to BE the spellcaster?
