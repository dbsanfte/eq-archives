I don't know what game you are playing or what drugs you are taking,
but you sure as hell don't know squat about EQ. 60 Monks with AA
points are not killing exp giving mobs every 30 seconds, which is only
one of your absurd claims. 

Even if your list was correct (and it's not), Druids are one of the
top 3 classes to take 1-60 (solo or in a group). Just because they are
not one of the "holy 3" (4 if you count Shaman), does NOT mean they
are broken or need any improvement.

Lay off the crack pipe.
