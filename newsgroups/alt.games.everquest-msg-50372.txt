Agree totally...I'm tired of hearing all the DAoC'ers talking about a mass
exodus...Verant going bankrupt....EQ folding....

Geesh!  If yer gonna leave...LEAVE ALREADY...and quit making stupid
commentary that nobody cares about.  EQ could lose HALF it's player base and
still be the most successful MMORPG game going.

I may try DAoC in the future and I may leave EQ when I feel it's time
but...I'm not gonna feel the need to inform the entire newsgroup.

Sorry for the rant <g>
