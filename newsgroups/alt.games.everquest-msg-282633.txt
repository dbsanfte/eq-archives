The thing that gets me is that the dishonesty apparently runs so deep in the 
offices at SOE that they feel the need to spin their decision.

Just try something new and different ... be honest with your playerbase.

They've (rather silently) stopped comparing their game to WoW, which is a 
step in that direction.  Go the next step ... just be honest and up-front 
with folks.  Admit you opened more servers than you needed.  You anticipated 
a need that wasn't realized.  The world won't stop spinning because your 
game isn't drawing the numbers you'd hoped for.  And if you're keeping SWG 
alive, EQ2 certainly isn't in danger of closing up shop.  So just be honest 
with people.

It'll never happen.  But it's a thought.

Interestingly enough, Blizzard fired up another handful of servers for WoW 
last week.  I suspect the timing was a coincidence.  Blizzard realizes that 
they're now the 800-pound gorilla of MMO games.

It's time for SOE to realize it as well, and settle into the PlayNC/Mythic 
mindset.  "We don't rule the roost, but we have our niche of players and 
they're loyal."

My opinion, FWIW.
