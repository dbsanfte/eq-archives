Basic formulae for druid skill caps are

Spell skills: (level + 1) * 5
Combat skills: (level + 1) * 4
Attack and defense: don't recall

Very bad. The best druid weapons are actually 1HB; they tend to have
better damage ratios and it is much easier to find a good 1HB with decent
stats. Work on this.

> 1H Slashing - 80

Put this aside for now. Yes, the druid epic is a scimitar, but except for
the stats it is a lousy scimitar.

> 2H Blunt -2

Focus on 1HB and don't let your slashing get too down. Many of the decent
druid weapons in the game are 2HB (Jaggedpine Staff and Wee Harvester, to
name two) but by 20th level, you can get better stuff and you probably
want to hold stat items in your off hand, such as a Testament of Vanear, a
small deity or one of the new idols (while these can go in the ranged
slot, they can also be held in both hands and are NOT lore) or even a
shield (charred guardian shields are VERY nice for druids.)

> Abjuration- 68

Abjuration is a VERY important skill for druids. It is used for all of
your skins and damage shields. While these are rarely needed in an
emergency situation, you will not be able to group if your protection
spells fizzle (which drains mana from other things.) Work on this by
getting a breeze or clarity then just casting Skin Like Wood on yourself,
over and over. As further practice, keep yourself magically shielded at
ALL TIMES, even if you are just sitting in the EC tunnel auctioning loot.

> Alcohol Tol -3

Don't bother. Getting drunk will (at higher tolerance) help add some stats
but it will ALWAY decrease your wisdom and by now that is by far your most
important stat. Take the oath and lay off the hard stuff.

> Alteration - 104

Right where it should be ([20+1]*5=105) Alteration is probably THE most
important skill a druid has: it is the skill used in healings, cures,
teleports, wolf spells (sow, wolf form) and other buffs. My druid usually
manages to max Alteration before she completes her first yellow bubble.
When you reach level 30, this is the skill you most likely want to
specialize in.

> Channeling - 105

Right where it should be. I am starting to notice (at 25th level) that my
spells are less likely to get interrupted by most mobs.

> Conjuration - 81

Another skill you should be working on. All of your damage over time
spells rely on conjuration, and with your first good dot -- creeping crud
at 24th -- you WILL want to be able to use it with minimal fizzle. An
example: I hunted the hermit in South Karana for a good chunk of 23rd and
all of 24th (and now in to 25th) Using snare and blast, I was usually out
of mana before the hermit was down, and had to wait almost 15 minutes
unbreezed before I could take him on again (he has a respawn of only about
3 or 4 minutes.) At 24th, I switched to root (with the new ensnaring
roots) and dot (with the new creeping crud), cast a damage shield on
myself (in case he broke free to early) and meditated while he was stung
to death. I learned pretty early how to tell when to reapply the crud. I
was now able to take him down with MAYBE 2 bubbles of mana, and never
needed to let a spawn pass. Heh, went through 24th faster than I went
through 7th.

The summary is, DEVELOP THIS SKILL! Root/dot is THE hunting method for all
druids level 24 and higher; your blasts will be reserved for when root
keeps breaking or when you just need to get the mob down NOW. Being able
to regain substantial mana while doing damage is something that druids
should be able to do well.

> Defense -90

Could be higher. Let the mobs get in a few punches. You will have to heal
now, but it WILL help prevent a world of hurt latter.

> Divination - 22

This skill should be worked on. The only important druids divinations are
camo, but that is a NICE spell. Being able to see invis is also very
helpful, and when you start porting, you may have to camo certain members
of your group so they can escape the druids (you may have noticed a lot of
dead trolls and dark elves near druid rings; that is why.) Loosing
business because your evil passengers tend to crash land is NOT good for
your income. Get a breeze or clarity and just chain cast See Invisible on
yourself; you will get this kill up in no time.

> Evocation - 105

Hmm... you've been doing blast kiting, I see (sow self, snare mob, run a
bit away, careless lighting the mob, run a bit away, careless lightning
mob, repeat until mob is dead.) Once you reach 24th and get your first
really decent dot (creeping crud), blast kiting will do you well. After
that, you will want to switch to root/dot as mentioned above.

> Hand to Hand - 1

Druids should never use hand-to-hand, we just aren't able to survive.
Don't bother with this skill.

> Meditate - 105

Right where it should be.

> Offense - 98

Right where is should be. Around now, though, you will find that offense
starts to slip. Don't worry about this, as your attacks will become more
and more spell based.

> Sense Heading -105

Excellent.

> Swimming -14

DEFINITELY put in practice here.
