I'm having the same issues with my OS being windows ME.  How do I set my
swap files to be consistent with my RAM?  I'm running a 1600XP AMD with
512MB of RAM and winME and a geforce3ti200 graphics card if that matters.

In zones like Ssra, and Velketors after an hour of playing in there I start
getting unbearable lag, but before that it's non existant.  Sounds like the
same thing.
