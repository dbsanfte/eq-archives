Yep - I will definately be keeping an eye out for singing steel stuff. The
gauntlet you mentioned is very good, also a SS bracer to replace the
blackened alloy bracer as well. The SS boots I got set me back 1k though so
I wasn't sure which pieces I could afford. I can leave the Symphonic Saber
on the wish list for a while yet till I hit grouping level though. On
legends it's pretty tough finding a group even in a large guild until you
hit the high forties...
