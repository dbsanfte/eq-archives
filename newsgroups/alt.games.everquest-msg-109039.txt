Some things never change.

It makes a difference to some. No they wouldn't. Sometimes you don't contend
every point made or answer every question raised. Not the only one. If you
think so then you will like this.

That moment of clarity and ease of reading is brought to you by top posting.

Just as a by the by: There are times when top posting is considered
appropriate. For instance in personal exchanges using email. Another would
be something like an answer to an invitation i.e. "Who is coming to my
wedding on Prexus?" A one line "I'll be there" can go anywhere.
