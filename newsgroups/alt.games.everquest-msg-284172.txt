I know, I complain about this a lot.

But it still gets my goat, every single time it happens.

There's a patch on.  I accept the need for patches; I may be dubious 
about the method they use to do them (I can't see why they can't do them 
in a rolling manner, for example) but I do get that basic maintenance, 
and their superlative record of constantly improving the game (as well 
as their abysimal record of frequently messing it up) require some down 
time.

I'm not sitting here saying they OWE me for the time when I can't play, 
I get that.

No, what I'm complaining about is that I can't tell when the patch is 
on, and when its done.

Go thru the log in procedure, I download patch and get to login, where I 
put my password in and... boom, get generic message suggesting (right or 
wrong) that I can't log in probably because of a patch in progress.

Is there a patch on or not?  Exactly how much effort would it take to 
have two messages, one saying there's a patch, the other saying that 
there isn't a patch and since I'm having difficulties anyway I need to 
check into it?

Do they not Know when they are patching and when they aren't?

Fine, fine, go to the eqlive web site, which has a helpful page, 
http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/network_status.vm
  thats simple and clear, servers are either up or down, and they say so.

Except that they show as UP when they are actually closed and only have 
GM's running around testing things.  Which is to say, during the 
majority of any patch.

Once upon a time, this page would show the population of each server; if 
this was 10 or under, then they were patching, if it was somewhere north 
of 200 and growing, server was really open!  They killed that, though, 
and replaced it with the yes/no thing which is simply useless.

Look at the Update notes.  Oooh, that would be informative.  Except that 
it isn't, because they don't put a message there when the servers are 
back up, either.

In fact, I've been unable to locate a single spot where they announce 
that the servers are open again.

Its quite possible that they -are- open, at the moment, because one of 
the notes they made was that they would be upgrading the login server 
itself; I can't get thru login, but can't tell if thats because I'm 
locked out, or glitched!

Vent vent venti... maybe I need more coffee.
