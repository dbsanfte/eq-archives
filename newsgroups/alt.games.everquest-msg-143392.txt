Further than that, you can set up multiple instances of EQ with
different setups if you wish. Copy your everquest directory and just
link to that exe. I've got seperate installs for raiding and general
exping, so you all it takes to get optimal raid setup is a /camp and
reload. No need to change the settings ingame and you never forget any
of them.

If I used EQW I could even set up multiple EQW directories, linked to
multiple EQ directories, so the windows were all set up and sized as you
wanted them. But the jury's out of the legality of EQW, so I wouldn't
dream of using it. But if you did, it would work. Allegedly.
