You're crazy. Since they added panic animal & sow at lower levels to rangers
they are amongst the most soloable melee classes around. You can fear kite
animals pretty much all the way up if you're so inclined (but how dull!) and
take zero damage with minimal mana output. 

Hell, at level 53 I soloed a named raptor in WL yesterday with 1 bub of health
and 2 of mana without taking more than a few hits of damage.


Group desirability is debatable - they're certainly not up there with shamans
or clerics but we're not as weak as you suggest. You'd be surprised how many
groups I leave saying "wow, I never knew rangers could do that".
