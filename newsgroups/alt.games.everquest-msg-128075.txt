Well since it only can be done in that tent stall area how soon do you
think it will be until every inch of space has characters stuffed into
it? I mean, with a couple thousand people actually PLAYING on a server
at anyone time how many MORE characters will be logged on to it while
the person is sleeping at night as a vendor? At least a few thousand
but there is no way they can fit. 

Pretty bad planning. Anyone with two accounts will simply park in a
good place and leave it there forver.
