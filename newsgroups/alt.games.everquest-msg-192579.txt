Welcome to the age of KEI, They bitch about yantis plat, monks
tanking, or rangers bow shots but KEI has changed the way people play
more than anything ever has by a long shot for the worse too I might
add. I play a bard just to be immune to the stuff...

A melee equivalent should be introduced into the game ASAP. 4 hour
long Aego + regrowth should do the trick, castable by any priest
class. Then we could listen to casters howl and cry about balence hey.
But this will never happen because EQ is like you said, a casters
game.
