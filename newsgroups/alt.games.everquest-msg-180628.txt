What always gets me is that people feel the need for EQ's fantasy
setting to adhere to existing liturature or be bound to Earth's RL
cultural nuances. People, EQ is a completely different realm with its
own rules, origins and evolution. There are no ties of Norrath to
Earth in any way, and its creators are not bound by any other source
than thier own makings. Yes, Norrath has been borrowed and inspired by
other sources (Tolkien, mythology etc....), but its beginnings, past,
and future are unrelated to anything else. Yes, they've imported
terms, ideals and structures, but that doesnt necessarily mean they
have to be bound by constraints.

They could (and probably should) have the option to have different
skin tones in all the races. But remember when this game was first
developed, it came about when 3D gaming was in its infancy in the late
90s. Perhaps it was considered but dropped due to technical
difficulties. It was one of the first few games that required a 3D
accelerator, which at the time was thought to be somewhat risky. Since
they've overhauled the graphics engine, perhaps they can consider
going back and putting this functionality in. Now that they are
putting in armor tinting, what can stop them from doing skin tinting?
