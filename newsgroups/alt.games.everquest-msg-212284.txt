As a matter of fact I have a pair of angels (angels, heh, oddly 
appropriate to this thread :). But in my case its a Gourami thats the 
'bastard' of the lot. He's harassed a couple of my other fish to death.

No I didn't create the fish. But I've allowed him to live; though I've 
replaced the casualties with stronger more assertive fish (Angels & 
Sharks) and have brought about a balance. The Gourami pretty much leaves 
the others alone now.

True, but Satan is evil incarnate, personified as a spirit being. My 
fish aren't mean because my "devilish counterpart" tugs their strings. I 
hold that mean people can be mean without a Satan to tug theirs.

I feel this is fallacious reasoning. Good and evil are the result of 
choice. An act is not evil (nor good!) if you could not make any choice 
that would avert the act. If you want to take a creationist approach, 
"God creates man, and grants him the freedom to choose his course of 
action."

That in and of itself isn't evil, but it has set the groundwork for 
letting us perpetrate acts both good and evil, without a force opposing 
God.

The typical response is "But why then did a good God create men who 
choose to be evil"...and the answer to that is really self-evident. God 
doesn't create good people and evil people. He just creates people. If 
he didn't then his gift of freedom of choice was a farce... you can't 
have God giving people the choice to choose between good and evil, and 
simultaneously have God deciding who is going to be good and evil.

And all religious faiths (that i know of) hold that each person has a 
choice, so that precludes God creating evil people.

And while you *can* have a devil seeking to seduce people to choose 
evil, it isn't strictly necessary to the consistency of the beleif 
structure.

To address the original thread, how does all this relate back to 
homosexuality? It doesn't really. I hold the opinion that sexual 
orientation isn't a moral question in the first place, anymore than 
being left or right handed is.


> Yin and yang.

Insofar as good and evil exist, balanced,  in every choice yes: yin and 
yang. But that doesn't imply there is a devil.
