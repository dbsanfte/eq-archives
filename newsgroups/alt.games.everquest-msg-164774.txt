My level 29 beastlord and a 29 mage tried to play here.
The "war" is a pain in the ass.  You don't know it's going on until you get
there:
When the owlbears are holding the zone you *might* get lucky and be able to
pull them without adds. 
When the grimlings hold the zone the ones you can single pull are green. 
It's no wonder the only people in this zone are over 50 and farming.
