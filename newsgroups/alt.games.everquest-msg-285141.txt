As an aside, you don't necessarily give up Bash.  You can still do
the so-called "ghetto bash", where you swap gear to equip a shield,
bash with it, then switch back to the two-hander.  The bandolier
makes this easy to hotkey.  You might miss a swing with the 2H, or
more likely get an occasional swing with the 1H while you have the
shield equipped, but overall it works well.  Note that, unlike a
pure "Bash" hotkey, the bandolier-bash-bandolier hotkey won't show
you whether Bash has reset, so you might need to keep your Combat
Abilities window open to let you see when Bash is available.
