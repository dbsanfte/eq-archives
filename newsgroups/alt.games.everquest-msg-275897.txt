I'm glad about the fishing nodes, they were in enormous abundance in
antonica and mostly unused. Perhaps if there was a fishing resource you
could drink? Seaweed cola, anyone?

Xp bonuses are a good thing to me because i can only access the game
sporadically and have pretty much been stuck in the tradeskill instance.
When i have more free time, it'd b nice to be able to head off, level up,
and still be able to complete my language quest using the mentoring system.
I am interested to know what happens if you mentor someone for firemyst
gully tho; don't you get different instances depending on what level you
are, so that you get the "failed" instance at level 20 or so?

More money is good too, as with the increased fuel costs, tradeskilling has
become a money sink, and i've had to skip buying recipe books etc.
