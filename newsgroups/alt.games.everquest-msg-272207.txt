A druid will play entirely different from a cleric or
shaman (and the same for the other classes) past-20.
That's true from about 12 up (when classes start
getting class-defining spells) and increases to a minor
degree with levels.  (The biggest change is in the 10-19
range when they get class spells.  After that it's more
defining the difference rather than the huge "wow,
*entirely* different spells in the teens.)

That would depend on what you mean by "identity."
A group with a mystic in it will use different tactics
than a group with a fury -- which would use different
tactics than a group with a warden.   But they can
all kill the same mobs equally effectively...

I'm not sure I understand the difference.   As long as
you make the *fundamental* decision each class can
do the same job, after that *everything* is "flavor."
If you do a good job, that "flavor" affects tactics, but
it still *appears* as "flavor."   A 150 HP ward is the
same as 150 HPs of regen is the same as 150 HP
heal.   But tactics within the group -- and by the
healer -- vary to accomodate different aggro, etc.

Aggro management, mob debuffs as compared to
player buffs, etc.  Same thing as in EQ -- except
the shaman has the same healing effectiveness (and
the heals work entirely differently...)

Well, 10 of those levels you were one a six classes.
I'm not sure how different you could be...

More like ~12 when the first wards/regens/whatever
are received.  Can't speak for the non-priest classes
but I'd guess the same.   After that it's refinement...

They've got a few things *perfect* IMO.   And a few
that need tweaking still.   And some just off-the-wall
*bad.*
