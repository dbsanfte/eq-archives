Who is to say what a person should deem offensive? You? Me? If you are
talking during a movie but are of the opinion that the people behind
you should not be bothered by a little chit chat, does that mean
you're not being discourteous? Are they wrong to ask you to be quiet?

It should be noted that there is a difference between expression and
casual overuse of profanity.

Not a shock at all. Some people like to deface bridges and overpasses
too. That's not right either. It's not hurting anyone, but that
doesn't make it ok.

I agree there are times when it makes sense and contributes to the
point being made.

I am a fan of Mr. Carlin. I also loved the Three Stooges, but I don't
go around poking people in the eyes and bonking them on the head.

However, my guess is that you don't/didn't do so nearly as much as you
might in other settings.

As did I for the most part. That doesn't make it the best way to
communicate.

I didn't ask if you *had* done so. I asked if you would/did *feel
comfortable* doing so. I have tripped up and done so on more than one
occasion and I can tell you that I did *not* feel comfortable about
it.  :)

I am a *very* open-minded individual. I merely have a
thoroughly-considered opinion on this issue.

"Great fucking sermon today, Father. All that shit about Moses parting
the Red Sea..." Nah, I can't see where anyone would be uncomfortable
within earshot of *that* conversation. See ya in confession.
