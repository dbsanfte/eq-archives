One thing you didn't mention is that it's possible to pick an
adventure based on your group makeup. Some dungeons you can slide a
cleric into the DPS role, some dungeons favor druids/mages due to
summoned creatures, some don't need snare (I think), etc. 

I don't break things down nearly as much far as you do, my general
rule is that I want 2 defensive classes (Cleric, shaman, enchanter), 2
tanks (SK, Pally, Warrior) and 2 DPS classes (mage, necro, wizard,
rogue). 

Monks, BST and Rangers can fill a tank or DPS slot, Druids can fill a
defensive or DPS slot. Bards I'll make room for unless it's already 5
people and we don't have at least one healer and DPS class. 

Realistically, give me one healer (cleric or shaman preferred), one
tank and 1 DPS class and I don't really care what the rest of the
group looks like. Cover those 3 basics and I'll take anyone I know is
competent, no matter the class, over an ideal class being played by a
person I don't know. 

Having said that, my perfect group would be:

Cleric, Shaman, Warrior, Ranger, Bst, Mage. 

Gives you rez, snare, tracking, 4 people and 2 1/2 pets to offttank,
defensive for those tough boss mobs and the  two best DPS classes (for
a dungeon crawl) in the game.
