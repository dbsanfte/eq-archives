I have got tailoring to 214 and thought I might start up my coldain shawl
quest again. So i joined a pickup group in velks... got there with a
shadowknight who told me more would be coming.

Anyway, a halfling rogue and others turn up, and we start killing spiders on
the first floor. I explained i needed the threads for my quest and asked if
anyone else needed them. No answer. The the shadowknight explained his
wizard needed them. Since there wasn't a wizard in the group, I couldn't
figure that one out. Anyway, spiders start dying, and the rogue loots...
everything. Velium, threads, etc. I ask what the loot strategy is. No
answer. I think, OK, I'm assuming FFA and if that means I'm low on mana, and
someone dies, so be it.

I ask the rogue why he's looting the threads, since i don't think the shawl
would be much good for a rogue considering the effort it takes to get one.
No answer. Bit of a pattern here. I also notice the rogue is fighting on the
same side as the shadowknight who is tanking, when he's not off on his own.
I keep thinking, "sheesh, everyone's at least level 57 and no-one here knows
how to fight as a group?"

So what I'm wondering is, do the threads actually have some value to a
rogue? Or was the rogue just mindlessly greedy and unaware that he could
backstab?
