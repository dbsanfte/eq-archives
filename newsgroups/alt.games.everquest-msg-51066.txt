Yet I am not burned.  Flaming may have impact on the weak and the insecure,
but I am neither.  I am secure in my knowledge and in my intellect, though I
do not claim to be the smartest person there is.  I won't claim not to be
either.  As I think Dark Tyger and I were able to agree on another set of
posts in this thread, people can claim to be anything they want to be in
this group.  Nobody is obligated to believe them, and I certainly wouldn't
expect anyone to believe my own claims, however modest they may be.
Boasting and false humility, while opposite in aspect, are both
characteristic of insecurity anyway.  So if you care to, may I recommend you
read some of my posts in this group and others and see if you can gauge the
kind of person I am.  Let me assure you, you can wear carcinogenic tights
'til doomsday.  I could not be less impressed.
