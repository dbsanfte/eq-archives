    I would agree with the cleric thing.  I can't see even a stark naked cleric
having a hard time finding a group (might be hard _keeping_ them naked, people tend
to want to make friends with clerics).  And clerics can summon food, water, and a
weapon without any regents.  Teapray was doing fine hunting gasts at the age
appropriate level with everything banked.
    But I don't have the hotkey thing.  I've made sure to keep my defensive, dodge,
and of course channeling maxed out, and I don't wilt or panic the second a blue
starts bitch-slapping me.  I know that some would say that this really isn't
necessary for a cleric, but so far I haven't regretted doing so.
