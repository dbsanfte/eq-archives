That is the difference, in the case of a hospital lives are at stake, so
they damned well better have a backup plan for when the shit hits the fan.
EQ is a game, it would sure be nice if they also had one, but nobody is
going to die as a result, some people might lose some sleep, get really
upset, threaten to cancel their accounts and sue Sony/Verant for their 33
cents....  OK, there may be a few total loons out there that might die over
it, but that's an entirely different issue.
