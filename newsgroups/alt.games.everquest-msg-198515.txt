You were quite right to be suspicious.  The issue apparently was a bug
driven by the text in our guild message of the day that caused guild
members who had LoY to crash.  Clearing the motd fixed the problem,
but of course it was an interesting experience since most of the guild
couldn't get on, including the officers.

I've submitted a bug report to SOE... we'll see what comes of it.
