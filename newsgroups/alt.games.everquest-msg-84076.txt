I never pull a mob off of someone, even when I see they're in trouble,
unless they ask me to. I cast heals on them while they're beating on
it/them, but just enough to keep them alive. I always get a "thanks!" (and
that feels good) Sometimes I cast SoW on them, as a just-in-case, or
thistles... but I *never* take a mob. I've had it done to me before, and I
don't like it. I like, rather, for someone to be helpful -- keep me barely
alive so I CAN finish the battle -- but I really hate it when someone just
takes a mob that has aggroed on me, unless I yell for help.
