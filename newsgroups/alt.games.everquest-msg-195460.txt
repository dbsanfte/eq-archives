    Not to mention the unique "kite from above" fix that has been put into
the encounter. Read the Safehouse thread on that? Basically, if anyone on
the hate list of true Rallos Zek is a certain distance above RZ (measured in
Z-axis difference only), then they are teleported to one of several places.
So far, I've heard of people being sent on top of Maestro's piano in Hate,
on top of the Amy temple in Fear, beside Phinigel in Kedge Keep, and my
personal favourite, plonked down right beside the Spiroc Lord on Isle 5 in
Sky. Sort of a brutal solution, as at least one innocent person has been
nailed this way, but it sure stops the exploit problem!
