Hmm.  I somehow thought it was a cylinder (heck, it could be a truncated
dodecahedron for all I know), with the height varying by zone.  There are
some places I can AE without worry, even though I KNOW there are
critters just above or below me.  Others (unrest is one, the new hate is
another, didn't fight much in befallen so I don't know) seem to aggro other
floors even if I don't think they're anywhere close.
