	Two words: Panic Animal.

	Snare + fear + high melee output = quick safe kills with very little
downtime.  You have to stick with animals but there are animals all over the
game; if you're insane you can go to West Wastes and fearkite your way to 60
solo.

	Venture was either 50 or 51 when Panic went in for Rangers.  I had been
soloing, slowly, in East Wastes.  All of a sudden, my kill rate went through
the roof.  Elder Snow Griffins, which had been able to kill me in seconds,
became prime targets.  I would track them across the entire zone and pull them
back across the zone to safe areas for fearkiting.  They were about the only
thing I fought that incurred any downtime since I'd usually eat a few nukes
during the pull.
