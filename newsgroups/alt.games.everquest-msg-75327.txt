Druid spot in EJ can be dangerous, been attacked there several times, 
and had a guildie die on me once when i was taking him to FoB.

SF i only been to 2 times, first time because some poor DE needed a port 
in Bazaar, and payed 35pp for it (never going there for under 100pp 
after i seen the place), and a few min after because said DE forgot 
something in bank and gated back to Bazaar.
