    Wrong. Mana regen goes up as you level. More below.

    HP regen rates go up with level as well, but it's more a step function.
So you do see longer "regen to full" times, regardless of gear.

    Note that phrase: "regardless of gear". For most casters (and especially
for INT casters, which you are quite familiar with, Silverlock), not only
does pool as a function of INT/WIS go up as a function of level
(MANA=Level*{INT or WIS/5 + 2} is the exact formula IIRC), but in general
you get INT/WIS items and MANA items as you level, too. This creates the
"med rate slowing down" effect you seem hung up on. My level 24 mage has not
so much in the way of plus MANA items, but does have a high 180's INT. Her
med to full time is close to ten minutes, in line with the med to full times
high level wizards have reported. That's exactly what one would expect if
med rates scale up with level.

    Very true. For someone that doesn't have much time to game, DAoC is much
better - you can jump in, solo, and get progress of some sort in very little
time. EQ places much higher demands on your time.

    Perhaps your terminology is what is causing problems here. I may have
the levels incorrect, but for a non-regenerating race, your sitting HP regen
rate is 2 HPs/tick until level 20, 3 HPs/tick until level 51, and 5 HPs/tick
after that. Most people wouldn't call that "constant", as the regen rate
DOES go up as you level. But it certainly doesn't scale.

    I have read that Clarity also goes up as the Enchanter levels, but not
C2. I'll defer to you as the senior enchanter between the two of us, though.
