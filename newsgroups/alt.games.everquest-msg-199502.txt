1. Install SP1 for WinXP (http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com)
2. Install the latest version of DirectX 9.0a
(http://www.microsoft.com/directx)
3. Download and install the most recent driver for your video card.
(The SiS746 chipset uses a Xabre200 integrated video. You can find
drivers at http://www.xabre.com/download/drivers.html I have no idea
whether or not they will work with EQ)
