Everquest gets that way too, it took a couple years to be that way for
me. They kept on making add ons every time I was about to quit, those
bastards!

You can do that in EQ, but if you are a warrior a monster half your
level might kick your behind. EQ is the exact opposite of Diablo 2.
Though D2 is a short time mostly playing alone game you can play with
a couple friends sometimes and the classes are quite balanced. They
have to be in order to also play the game alone. In everquest, by
contrast, most classes NEED other people to group with to get much
done and ANY class needs to group with other people for the more uber
content (such as getting your epic quest weapon, which takes a guild
which can field 35 people plus to help you with parts of it (while of
course people in the guild want to do other things)

Knowing what I know now, with Star Wars Galaxies coming out by
december at latest and other MMORPGS in the pipe like city of heroes,
I'd not start EQ at this time. In spite of some GREAT improvements in
recent patches, it is just too stuck in the "downtime is good and
patience = gaining prowess", old MMORPG paradigm (which is really
something that Everquest INVENTED) One of its most lacking design
elements is that some classes can do nearly everything on their own
(play from 1 - 60 never talking or grouping with a soul, though they
won't get the highest end content or their epic.. of course never
doing epic/planes mobs they don't need those things either) while some
can't leave freeport hardly without a cleric strapped to their back.

Its a seriously flawed MMORPG stuck in the seminal past of mmorpg
design. The irony is that it is STILL the best mmorpg that exists and
the one that people return to after they go and try Anarchy Online or
Dark Ages of Camelot. Rather than being a feather in EQ's cap, that
really just shows how designer's don't get it. Players want a game
without too much downtime where the challenge is based on their level
and skills, not on their patience in camping something for 70 hours.
Players want a constantly changing random world with plenty of static
and evolving content. What players really want is a real challenge to
make, but it sounds like games like Star Wars Galaxies might be
getting it right. 

When a player doesn't play an MMORPG for a year, he should get back in
it and be flabergasted due to how much the game world has changed and
how much is now unfamiliar. This does not exist in any mmorpg yet.
They are getting closer and for as old as it is the newest Everquest
upgrades to some old zones are doing that as well as anyone is. Even
those changes are static though.

To really make it worth playing Everquest, you have to get Kunark (old
eq and kunark) and luclin. Then at level 30 you have to get velious.
There is some gold box out now with all of them but I think its only
in Europe and australia at this time? I say you have to get those to
make it worth it because just old EQ is really not a fair intro to the
game. If you have the machine to run it, using the new models and
playing a vah shir or something in luclin is a great intro to the
game. Luclin is as close to an EQ2 as we have right now (with the real
EQ2 a year and a half off) Planes of power is coming in the fall and
should give the game a boost, but more on the high level end (though
lower players can go to the main quest/knowledge city and actually do
things as well as using the nexus like portal system)
