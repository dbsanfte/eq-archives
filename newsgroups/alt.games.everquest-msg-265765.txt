Instancing as done in LDoN doesn't give the option. The limitation isn't 
inherent to instancing.

You are really dumping more on what LDoN did with instancing than really 
giving instancing a chance. At any right I liked -some- of the 
experiences I had in unrest... I liked the surpises, the conversation, 
the trains, the fighting. I was however, disenfranchised when it I went 
during peak hours, and could walk unmolested from room to room from top 
to bottom. There was no sense of immersiveness or of exploration in 
that, mere irritation and frustration. I felt as if (and truly it was 
the case that) this dungeon had been already been cleared, and that I 
should go somewhere elese... but where. Unrest was one of my favorite 
zones on its own merits; i still take my alts there for a level, despite 
it being a virtual ghost town that few people even know the way to.

Is it possible to strike a happy medium. Maybe... with instancing. Let 
unrest fill up to 25 people, and then start another one. After all 
Unrest doesn't get more fun at 35 people. By that point the number of 
mobs alive in the zone is less than the nubmer of PCs. And at 50 there 
aren't any mobs left alive for more than a few seconds each.

Sure you could rail on the devs to build another zone for people to go 
to. But instancing is cheaper, gets the jobs done. I'd rather have them 
build just a few better interesting well thought out instanced zones 
than a plethora of shoddy non-instanced ones.

(And again LDoN is the worst of both worlds... a few shoddy instanced 
zones.)

Micro-instancing doesn't really limit interactivity, as I envision it.

I think theres other places where instancing makes sense, and a great 
many places where it doesn't. Some encounters should be solo only, 
should be one group only, if for no other reason than just to provide a 
richer variety of experiences. Instancing ensures that these encounters 
aren't trivialized by bringing your whole guild along. That's a good 
thing.

No more than anyone wants -their- vision of a game made into a reality.

The best of both worlds. :)

Undermines level design. It works fine in the Plains of Karanas, but the 
Goblin King should be found in the throne room, or its antechamber... 

Even if you want to mix it up and let him spawn in the bar every now and 
then, most of the time he should be where he 'belongs'.

Oh... if only more of them had somehting to say... don't even get me 
started... that was my greatest let down with EQ when i first started 
it. Wandering around Qeynos with my first character being roundly 
ignored by 95% of the npcs, 4% that said something trite, .9% that 
assigned to a quest that I could not hope to complete for 40 levels, and 
.1% had something to say to me that I could 'interact' with.
