Only one of my characters, my Druid, has had an actual encounter with
the 'goons.  It went something like this:

'goon01 says, "Stupid human, I will feed you to the worms."
[I take off for the FM zone, easily escaping in wolfform, but...]
[I don't spot 'goon02 thru the haze (damned rain), and...]
'goon02 says, "I bet you'll taste good marinated in a wine sauce."
'goon02 begins to cast a spell
Returning to your own perspective
You are engulfed by darkness
General_V'nereal says, "Boy, didn' Ah tell you to stay offa mah
propahty?  You hold still, hear?  This is gonna hurt you a lot
an' Ah ain't gonna feel nuthin."
General_V'nereal hits YOU for a lotta damage
General_V'nereal hits YOU for some more damage
General_V'nereal hits YOU for even more damage
'goon02 runs up and kills YOU because like every properly trained Inny 
follower he hates his boss gets his kicks by KSing him.

I was well off the patrol path when the first 'goon agro'd, I think
some high levels were killing them and the fight went sour and they
zoned, coming back later to try again.  I say this because took no
HTs when I was killed, and when I zoned back a little later to get
my corpse I came across (and looted) a dead 'goon.
