Ok guess we still aren't communicating well...

1)   /ooc lets the entire zone know you are healing soandso, for what reason
other than to to have more garbage clutter up your text screen.
2) /say is what I have seen on every raid I have been on. Pullers and such
don't want you using main channel for heals, it is reserved during battle to
call out mezzed mobs, adds, and a change in targeted mob
3) the only people during a raid that need to know you are healing soandso
are the other healers, the tanks will continue to battle regardless if a
heal is incoming or not.
4) as to definitions, not much X healing needed in guild event, ya just put
clerics with tanks and secondary healers are with casters. In a raid there
are never enough clerics to go around and a single cleric healing on the
pull group may not be enough. Much different tactics used in those
situations.
And if they want to wear plaid they may indeed :o)
5) but my main point is that there is no need to spam the raid channel, all
the caster/healer types are typically in one area /say will reach them,
personally I hate spam and avoid it when possible
