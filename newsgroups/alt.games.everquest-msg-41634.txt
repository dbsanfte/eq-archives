Do you seriously believe that a majority of the population of any country in
the world truly feels this way?  Most of the population of a country like
Afghanistan is much more worried about how to make it through the day than
about anything else.  Yes, we could exterminate the entire population of the
country, but what do you think that makes us?  Do you have any idea how many
Afghanis want their current government removed?  Do you have any idea how
many Palestinians abhor terrorism, and want peace?  Do you have any clue
what the difference between throwing rocks at armed men, and blowing
yourself up in a crowd of people is?  I can't even put my reaction to your
statements in words.
