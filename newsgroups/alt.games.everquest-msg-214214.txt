How exactly am I wrong? How is telling people if they don't attend x%
of raids they don't get even a chance at the loot not going to
encourage certain people to put off more important RL matters? You
can't possibly tell me that you don't believe that there are those who
don't have their priorities straight and that this won't cause them to
ignore more important parts of their life, because you seem to have at
least half a brain.

What's there that I "completely" lack the understanding of about "If
you attend less than 60% of raids, you don't get loot"?

It's so nice to be able to brush off a point by simply saying "YOu're
wrong, you just don't understand" and leave it at that without
explaining your statement. Why bother replying at all if that's all
you're going to say? You're better off that way...
