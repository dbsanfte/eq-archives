at least one a day to this email, the one i use for "sign ups" on web
sites, that  alledge to have privacy statements etc, is about 200
messages a week or more.
about 50/50 between porn spam (which I have never used that address for)
and Other which is mostly split between get out of debt and bulk email
messages.
