i still do not know alot about the game, so i would appreciate it if i could
get a list of all the everquest expansions and whether or not they are worth
getting.  (heard Gates of Discord is crap)  and also what is everquest 2? is
that the one for the PS2 thats coming out soon?  is it worth buying more
expansions or do you think that alot of people will stop playing eq and move
to eq2?

oh yeah, for the expansion thing, i already know Legacy of Ykesha, Ruins of
Kunark, Shadows of Luclin, and Gates of Discord.  is that it or are there
more?
