27 necro will get butchered in OT. I found it pretty hard going at 32. Until
then its probably easier fighting low blues in loio. I did 32 and 33 just
north of the giant fort in fm. They dont wander there. Pull wandering
burnyai's brutes goblins and giants that wander just to your north.
At 34, with vos and better fear, you can solo just about anything  thats
blue, and maybe whites and yellows. reds would resist too much to makee it
worthwhile, if posssible at all. I found the snow cougars in IC particularly
easy, and in the right places, their pathing can be very convenient for fear
kiting ( The snow islands )
