A single PC in his 40s should be capable of killing the drake that
drops the keys, depending on class (as a cleric, for instance, I
had no trouble at 44)

The mob is about level 35, has no spells, and not an out of line amount
of HP for his level.  You will have to deal with a second mob in the
room who is higher level (40?) but there's no need and in fact likely
no desire to kill that mob, just park it with a root or mez or whatever
your parking method is, kill whisper to get your key and then leave.

While you get undesirable faction hits for killing him, they appear to
be very tiny, I killed him and had no drop in faction to the COV, and
my faction proceded to go -up- after I killed just a few more giants.
