I saw it, recognized your desire not to really get into a discussion on
it and let your explanation drop.  Sorry you got dragged back in, I
really wasn't trying to give you a hard time.  I just wanted to point
out the difference between understanding the behavior and rationalizing
it.  I understand it but don't accept the rationalization of it in case
I haven't made that clear.

True enough, yet not how I would look at it.  I see it more as if even
if the person who stole it does nothing worse in their life I hope they
are unable to sleep at night.  My entire  point is that no circumstance
warrants abuse of others for self gain.  Others who "ask" you to abuse
them are one thing, but to force your abuse on someone else simply
because you can is contemptible.  I do not sense that you are such a
person and am not claiming you are, I simply have an issue with anyone
who can support the act even if done by another.
