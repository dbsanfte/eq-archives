To tell you the truth, I've never really used a melee before until, I got my
own summoned hammers, that proc like crazy, and that's still only an
occasional thing, and only because I'm a dwarf, and get an extra bonus to
the proc's on top of the bonus the weapon, and your yaulp spell gives you.

My damage output is still low even with a weapon that procs for 200 to 300
damage every 2 to 3 swings, cleric's are just not made to be heavy hitters.
We fight with spells, when we fight, more often we heal. Get 2 people
together, offer to power level a warrior with the cleric or something is my
suggestion, and have the warrior fight, while the cleric heals, and you can
help out the warrior, who in turn, is getting the cleric experience.
