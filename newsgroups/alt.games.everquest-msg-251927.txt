This has nothing to do with what I said. I was referring to the way
other characters seem to spin wildly for a moment when looking at
another player sometimes. They turned just as the client prediction

 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
