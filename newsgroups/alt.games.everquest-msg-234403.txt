Nah, not every pet class.  When I am soloing with my pet, I stand next to 
the mob and let it smack me around while my pet chews it up.  No aggro 
control to worry about, PC is always attacked if next to a mob, 
regardless of what the pet does.  If I am not using a pet, I am generally 
root rotting, in which case, again, aggro is immaterial, I will be the 
only one on the list, and I will be at the top of the list.  The only 
time I would aggro kite would be if I was doing PoP mobs in an open area.
