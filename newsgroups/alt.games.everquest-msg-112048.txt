To further nitpick, Soffi is waisting some lines (or at least running
the risk of it not working if you can't quickly do a manual mouse target
in some cases) for no reason. /assist can have a target specified in the
line as long as it's a valid name. For raids, assuming Tankbob is the
MA, I adjust my keys to say

/assist Tankbob
/g Assisting Tankbob with %t

No muss. No fuss. You'll now have the same thing targeted as Tankbob and
be autoattacking. (Unless you have that turned off, like I do.)
