I'm in a similar situation.  I left EQ a couple of months before LDON,
after playing since a week after launch.  Despite the 4+ years played,
my highest char was a 52 druid, and I never really went beyond
"casual" player.  But I find myself missing it.  Most of my old guild
moved on to WoW, but I just don't think it's for me.

So I was thinking of finally picking up LDON ($10 for digital
download) and getting a month or three subscription to just mess
around again.  But I keep wondering if it'll be anything like the game
I remember.  I've never been so bloody nostalgic for a game before...
it's unnatural, I tell you.

So what's the deal with the Dreadlands being a deathtrap now?  I knew
there was an event that changed FV, but my beloved DL?  Any other
zones that I should know about before taking the plunge?
