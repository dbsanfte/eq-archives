Yeah when my insanely rich barb shaman got to gfay I was greeted by
scads of unwashed naked half, wood and high elf masses which I could
not understand (yeah, half elves can speak human but of course they
all have elf on since the other elves jabber constantly in ELF)

I was surprised to find jakum webdancer at the bard guild is disabled.
For those of you who don't know about him, basically on every new eq
server a wood elf I made would get enough gold for a sewing kit and to
make all patchwork just by delivering the 3 possible bard mails to
him. So they must have disabled him for the moderately easy money for
elves or dwarves. Really its still a bit of a long run though so I
think its kind of unfair. 

The funny thing is that they did not disable my ability to deliver 3
bard mails at once (4 one time I was bored and took boat to erudin
also) to the bard guild in qeynos from Halas, wk barb camp and
surefall. Surefall is certainly as close to qeynos as the high elf
city is to the wood elf one, so I can't see why they disabled Jakum.
They seem to really only disable leg up quests in the most popular
areas like Gfay and Rivervale.

Meanwhile I almost feel guilty about getting all my spells and lots of
gold and even a polar bear cloak (very rare clover leaf shipment
reward) and a ton of xp from running since level 3 or 4 through BB and
doing 3 bard mails, the lion meat shipment and the clover shipment
quests. Once I could gate the circuit was especially fast and better
than competing for spawns with 150 nakey barbs. 

It was funny when my barb got to freeport at nine and a dark elf I
could not understand was obviously trying to get me to trade my polar
bear cloak for 3 pieces of patchwork and a giant snake fang.. AHAHHAH
SURE. The regular way to do that quest is to get a polar bear skin
from a cub and give it to karg in Everfrost (who is still wonderfully
always alive for the moment with 5 plat, so the free one for the
lowbie clover shipment which usually yields a max of a level 5 spell
was fun ;) Out of all the times I did it though I only got the polar
bear cloak once (and its not lore)

Hmmm I actually have 5 plat now to get a couple, in fact 13 plat. I
only have 13 plat in addition to my 63 or so gold though because I
happened upon a gm quest in nro near freep. Some high elf red to me at
9 (when most people are green or blue and just a few yellow, though I
saw a red cleric and rogue at the chessboard in butcher when I  made
10 yesterday) was there and I paused and shouted for a bind in freep
again for an sow. Then I noticed she even had a last name and I
thought it pretty impossible that a player could be that high and it
dawned on me then she was a quest character. So I sow'd the dark
elves, elves and human escorting her to freeport and buffed them (love
being neutral ;) ) . I tried to sow her but my spell won't work on a
gm/guide/quest char I guess. When she got to freeport safely (oh
yeah.. like we were insturmental in that ;)  ) she gave me and I
presume all of them 10 plat. 

So now im in butcher doing well, no one can bind me yet, and im indiff
with stormguard still after camping bandits and such with 4 dwarf
warriors I could not understand hardly at all ;) and I need amiable
with them to turn in this trumpy head for the bloodforge magic hammer
before going back if I can't get a bind.
