Don't forget that, in the late 80's they had a machine with
a dramatic technical edge -- both in hardware and software --
and they squandered it.  Add to that the nearly criminal money
mishandling by the execs at CBM and the Amiga never had a
chance over the long run.

The best thing that came out of it was that my A4000 actually
appreciated in value after CBM folded - so when I decided to
sell it I got a full return on my investment after over 2.5 years
of using it.  Man I liked that machine - That '040 was as fast
as a PC came back then, AGA provided decent resolution graphics
in 256 and 8bit HAM (incredibly useful as a final format for
POV scenes and animations) and the Zorro III bus predated PCI
by several years and had Autoconfiguration, 25mhz, and 32bit wide
addressing and data paths (with a 64 bit wide burst mode IIRC).

Additionally, the open software movement really latched onto
it, with a tremendous amount of GNU tools available.  <sigh>
I miss it :/
