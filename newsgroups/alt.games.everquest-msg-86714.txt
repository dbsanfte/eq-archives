Subject: how does group xp work?

I'm trying to understand how experience is given out in a group with
players of different levels.

If player A (say level 20) kills a yellow con, A gets a pretty good
amount of xp (assume no pet).

Now if player A (level 20) groups with player B (level 23) and they
kills the same MOB (yellow con to A, blue con to B), roughly what
happens to the xp?

	1) Does A get half of what A normally would get for killing
	that yellow con?  And B gets half of what B would get for
	killing a blue con?

	2) Or does A get less than half of what A would get for
	killing the yellow (because of comparing A level to B level),
	and B more than half of a blue con?  How much less than half?

	3) Or since one player in the group is fighting a blue (to
	them), does the whole party get xp based on a blue con?  So
	A would get half of a blue con and B half of a blue con.

Sometimes in groups the xp is very poor and I'm wondering if it has to
do with item 3.

Anyone have guidelines for how to construct a group (only levels
ignoring classes and zones) and what to hunt?
