Its a case of different strokes for different folks; I find the 
incredibly repetitive nature of sound in every game I've played 
downright insanity provoking after the first few repetitions.  I've 
probably got over a thousand hours of EQ playing under my belt, if I had 
to do it with the sound on I'd have long since given up the computer and 
started running from here to california and back

I also react poorly to musac tapes running in businesses, to top 40 
radio (not just to whats on, but to the fact that tomorrow I'll be 
hearing essentially the same songs in a different order, and so on the 
next day and the next, till next week when a couple songs are dropped 
and a couple added to the "rotation"

If you can show me a game where the sounds are different, not 
repetitive, during all the hours I spend playing it, I'll admit that I'd 
like to be able to "hear" the ambient noises and to be able to use those 
sound cues that tell me mobs are doing something out of my line of sight 
and so on.

EQ isn't that game; even if I could ignore the zone music and the attack 
music, the -same- sound every single blessed time I cast a given spell 
(do you have any idea how many thousands of times I've cast CHeal, for 
one?... or think of my bard, singing 5 songs every cycle?  GAH!) would 
just drive me around the bend, I'd be jumping off the Eastern Wastes 
bridge... oh wait I do that anyway.  I'd turn on the sound for a splash 
noise when I hit the surface :)

Only game I can recall where I didn't get that effect was Neuromancer, 
with a long enough DEVO soundtrack and short enough gameplay that it 
didn't really get old.
