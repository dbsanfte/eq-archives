This is incorrect.  For a simple proof, fletch some "Range: 0"
arrows (ingredients:  Field points, Bone shafts, Shield
fletchings, Large nocks).  Despite the fact that the "lesser
of the two ranges on the bow and arrows" would then be zero
no matter what bow you choose, you'll find that you can still
shoot these arrows considerably farther than beyond the
tip of your nose.

The range is actually the range of your bow PLUS the range
of your arrows.  Long-range arrows can overcome the shortcomings
of a short-range bow, and vice versa.  And a long-range bow
combined with long-range arrows can give you an incredible
range, you'll be able to hit mobs you can barely see.
