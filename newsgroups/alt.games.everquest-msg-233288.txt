How do the Monk skills Feign Death and Mend continue to improve
as skill goes from 100 to 200?  I've tried researching it on the
Monkly-Business and other sites, and can't find much.  It looks
like Mend basically works all the time after level 100, and I
haven't noticed any differences in how it works.  For FD, I'm
wondering if perhaps it starts to reset faster?

I had a hotkey set up for:
	/doability <feign death>
	/stand
	/doability <instill doubt>
to give me something to do while camping or travelling.  (The
feign + stand cancels autorun, but if I hold the forward-arrow
key while doing the above hotkey, and then autorun again, I can
run without really breaking stride.)  I'd found that the timing
on the two skills was such that if I hit the key again just as
feign popped up (even though ID was still down), then ID would
pop up just in time to get invoked again.  But last night, with
my FD skill at 119, I began seeing times where I'd hit the key,
and the feign/stand would work, but no instill doubt maneuver.
I think it might be because feign is resetting slightly faster,
so ID isn't ready in time.

Does anyone know if FD really does start resetting faster, or
how else it might be getting better at higher skill levels?
And similarly for Mend?
