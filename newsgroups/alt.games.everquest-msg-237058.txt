Well unless you are talking about your very own religion (and would
thus be making a virtually moot point), it is likely that you don't
get to opt out. All the major religions use omni properties to
describe their deities, and as you probably know every omni property
leads to a logical paradox. If you are a member/believer of a
religion, you don't get to cherry pick your beliefs. If you cherry
pick your beliefs, you're not a member of that religion. Either you
buy it or you don't.

The problem is that unlike with just about everything else in life,
finding a paradox in a particular religon, does not convince a
believer that there is a problem. In normal logic (read: whenever it
doesn't concern religion), it doesn't matter if you can find me 1000
points supporting your theory. If I can find one, just one paradox in
your primary chain of reasoning, the whole thing falls apart. End of
story.

The common counter argument here is not to take things to literally,
and pre emptively I'm going to argue that whoever is willing to say
that won't be willing to take their own medicine. If it's not to be
taken so seriously than god is probably just a handy description for a
karma concept expressing "try to be good".

While this is true, you're going where Descartes went. And then you
suddenly know nothing (except that you exist, and you can't really
derive anything from that). It's not a practical place to take any
argument, but it is important to remember that any theory about the
origin of existance produced thus far (scientific or religious) has
had to make initial assumptions (or premises - whatever you want to
call them). However I subscribe to the whole occam's raizor theory.
The scientific version has a lot of parts that can be verified, and
that correctly predict and demonstrate things that are now happening.
The biblical version completely lacks cohesion (light before the sun
is created, punishing adam and eve for doing "something bad" without
giving them knowledge of the difference between good and bad, the fact
that at one point all people alive were 3 brothers [take that
biology!], etc. to use examples from one common religion).

So If it comes down to take your pick, guess what is objectively a far
more reasonable theory to accept?

No it didn't. A talking fish would not happen by a genetic freak
mutation. Unless you can produce evidence for a genetic freak mutation
that does something even remotely close to what you are suggesting,
this is nonsense. Neither would a two mile tall guy be a genetic freak
(who by the way would have to have grown that tall if it was a genetic
freak. - don't you think someone would have noticed along the way?)

If god is that great, you'd think he could come up with a way to show
his existence without question. But if he exists, he's clearly not
interested in doing so.

If god is bound by the laws of energy conservation, then how does it
take 5 days to create earth, 1 day for the other trillions of
galaxies, solar systems, planets etc etc.. and oh yeah, why does the
omnipotent god take a day for rest? How can god be with everybody in
heaven, listen to prayers and adjust reality accordingly? If you ever
do the math on how many people have lived (and are born and die ever
day) and take a conservative estimate of how many went to heaven you
get something like a tiny fraction of a second that god can spend on
each one of us. yay.

What I'm trying to say is, why is so freaking difficult for god to
prove he exists? It really shouldn't be. I could think of 100 ways off
the top of my head.

How very X-Files/X-Men of you. If you're actually trying to suggest
that the guy that wrote a story in the local tabloids about meeting
god resembles anything to be even remotely taken serious then I just
lost a load of respect for your rationality.
