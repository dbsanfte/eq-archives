Hi all.

As a level 26 ranger I was wondering where to go next.  I hunted in Paludal
caverns to 26.  I am still there but the bandits are starting to con green
and light blue.  I am farming bronze piece right now to get me a Ry'gorr
battlemail suit.  Now my question.  Where would be a good spot to go to on
the moon that will give good exp.  Loot is not an issue right now.  I want
to bring up my combat skills and such.  I picked up a Silver swift blade for
100pp in the bazaar.  Havent built up 2h slash to its max :(

Thanks in advanced for all your help
