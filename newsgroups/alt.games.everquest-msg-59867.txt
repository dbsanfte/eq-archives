You know, there's a reason they have you click the ToS every time you log
in.  There's also a reason they say that terms are subject to change.  The
agreement is valid only as long as you're logged on.  Next time you sign in,
it's a new arrangement (which is usualy identical to the old one).

And the servers belong to Sony, and the ablilty to access the accounts
belong to sony.  Also, be wary of lawyers.  They're not the ones who pay the
price if they loose a dubious case, after all, it's your money.  Most
companies will go along with them to save themselves from court costs, but
that doesn't make it legal.

After they've knocked someone back into their hell level, or cost them some
piece of uber loot.
