My girlfriend is interested in playing EQ and we thought it would be fun to
both start a character each together and group for any of the time that we
play.  What are some ideas for two classes working well together.  I'm
thinking Warrior and Cleric/Druid, but what are some other ideas.  Two
classes that can be created with a race or two races that start close to
each other (Half-Elf, Dwarf, High-Elf) would be really helpful, and not two
races that are KOS, since as a new player, I think she'd enjoy being able to
see the world.

Thanks in advance for any ideas.
