I'm a non-KOS mage, and I'm not ally. I can walk through Chardok wherever I
want, and it freaks people out. :) I've COHed people there just fine.

That is, unless they changed something... I havent been there in a while.
So, unless theres some other reasons for your mage to be ally, youre
probably fine. Trick is finding a mage thats not KOS. I'm only non-KOS
because I was bored and spent weeks PLing some kids in Droga. I dont
remember the exact numbers offhand, but I believe it was roughly 1000
froggie kills to get non-KOS.
