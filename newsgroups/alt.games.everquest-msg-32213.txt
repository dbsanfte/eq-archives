Speaking from experience I really don't get too worried until my life is
around 1 bbl or less. That is if there is a competent cleric around.

I don't care to get that low regularly. Usually that's when the random
wandering MoB or two find your group and then you're in real trouble.
Getting low on health is not worth the risk (IMHO) just to go into a
berzerker frenzy so I would have to say keep those tanks full (or close to
full) unless you're either a) power-leveling someone, b) very very low on
mana, or c) asked not to heal.
