Lol, that bastard.  There I was, all trained up with the knowledge that I 
could escape any mob because I was level 9, and I had a SoW.  That's OK, 
I made up for it by using a couple of those HQ lion pelts (Yes, those 
fleeting quiver ones) to make some sealed poison vials.  Doh!!

At least by the time I got killed by a Griffxxx in NK a few levels later, 
I was aware that some mobs could run at least as fast as I could with 
SoW.
