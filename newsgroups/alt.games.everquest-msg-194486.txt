Yes, some effects are less than spectacular, depending on what kind of
spells you cast, but mana preservation, spell haste and improved range
are useful to everyone, and most casting classes have use for many of
the other effects, though seldom if ever much use for all.

My point was that focus effects are more important than anything else
for a caster, in my experience. First try to get the important focus
effects, then worry about anything else. Different rules of thumb may
apply if you're raiding or at much higher level or are a fashion
victim, but for the non-raiding mid-level caster, focus effects should
be the top priority.
