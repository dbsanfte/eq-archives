Doesn't matter what happened to your key...it's only good for one
installation
anyways, and after that it's just a pretty string of numbers  and letters.

I've installed EQ on a bunch of computers (bunch = 4 ;-)  ) that I have
access to and time to play.  Once the account was created, the only
thing you ever need is the user name/password.

Now if i wanted to actually play more than once account at the same time,
it wouldn't matter how many machines I installed it on.  I'd need a separate
key to "activate" each account and create a user name/password for it.
