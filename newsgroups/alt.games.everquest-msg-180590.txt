Well since everquest is a game that can create addiction, and get you into
the game without leaving you screen for hours. I thought that i will tell
you how important it is to have breakfast.

Here is my way of solving this.

Buy a box of Kellogs cereals
Buy some fresh sweet strawberries
Buy one cart of milk
Get a bowl
pour downd some milk after serving yourself a nice portion of cereal, cover
it with strawberries
add some sugar if you want.

And voila.

you got yourself a nice breakfast ready to go with the game.

Special thanks to my dear friend D T

:P
