Ya know, all this talk about past travels by your low-level chars has 
brought back memories of my first few weeks playing.  I didn't know it 
was dangerous for me to travel (by foot, pre-PoP) across Faydwer.  My 
dwarf Rogue scrambled all over the continent (missed Dagnor's cauldron 
and therefore Unrest, as I didn't know there was a zone there!), 
Butcherblock, GFay, LFay, Kelethin, Felwithe, Steamfont, Ak'anon.  Just 
exploring.  And, when I decided to go to Freeport, running around 
Antonica as a level 6 or 7, oblivious to the fact that I was going to 
places that could see me dead..commons (east and west), NRo, Oasis, SRo.  
I even made a run, at night, to Rivervale and back, not knowing that 
Kithicor was a bad place to be at night.

When my RL and ingame friends (at the time the same people) learned where 
I had been and what I had been doing (leveling in Oasis, grouped), they 
told me how I should be more careful, blah blah balh.  But you know what?  
THAT time was the biggest blast I've had in this game.  The shocked 
reaction that a <10level char could run to SRo and back to FP without 
even getting attacked. And, until I was told how dangerous it was, I 
didn't even get dead...came close, though!  But after?  Dead alot!

I'm rambling, but am finally getting to the end.  I have NEVER put stuff 
in the bank for safe keeping (meaning my armor and stuff like that...I 
*DO* keep stuff in the bank that I don't need), as I don't remember EVER 
having a spare set.  So I have had to be REALLY careful about remembering 
where I'm dead.  And some of my stuff was given to me, but I treasured 
it, and still do, as I KNEW how hard it would be to replace it.

That's my story.  Have a good one.
