The command is /split # # # #  (number each of pp, gp, sp, and cp.)
It only splits what you tell it to split, so it's fairly easy to subtract
whatever you had when you started.   BTW, the numbers are required,
so to split 23 gold, 17 silver, and 123 copper the command would be
/split 0 23 17 123.   (No plat to be split.)   To split just 180 pp, the
command would be /split 180 0 0 0.

The /split command works the same way as autosplit as well.
If you have a full group, and split 55 pp, the person doing the
split will get 10pp and the rest 9pp.

The latter.   You can reach one end of the scale, but faction isn't
ever locked.   (Except for those where there's no way to change it
once KOS and those which have no mechanisms to change in the
other direction, of course.)
