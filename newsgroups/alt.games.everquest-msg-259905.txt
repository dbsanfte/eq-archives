On the whole I'll take EQ addicts over soccer fans any day of the week... 
Having said that, there is a very simple reason for the difference in 
fan bases: Soccer is accessible, and EQ, on the whole, isn't. But I 
don't think that soccer is more addictive... after all, very few people 
keep on playing (or even watching) soccer past their bedtime.
