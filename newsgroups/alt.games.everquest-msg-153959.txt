Just like 6 60 rogues or wizards could group up and get exp on another
guilds raid mob anyway

The problem wasn't with people KSing raid mobs from guilds after they
engaged (or letting guilds do enough damage so that it could then be killed
by MB).. that is KSing pure and simple, its actionable and I believe that
would earn warnings and suspensions pretty fast

As for raid level encounters 6 MB's can kill -
Use 7-8k as a rough guide per MB (its the minimum my guild wizzies would hit
for)
So thats anything with 42-48k HP, of course with a critical, just one wizard
can hit for 18-20k, but its unlikely, so don't plan numbers around it

Anything in Kunark (32k hp max)
Wuoshi (40k or so HP dragon in WL with absolutely ass loot)
KD (sea dragon in CS)

Thats it pretty much (of what would be considered raid targets anyway)
With 12 wizards you could kill some first broods - Sontalak and Klandicar..
but finding 12 MB wizards online, not raiding, and with MB currently
available isn't a common thing - I think it happened all of like 3 times on
Prexus

Luclin - nothing of great importance comes to mind.. on the vast majority of
mobs its a nice little boost, but it doesnt even visibly move mobs HP
