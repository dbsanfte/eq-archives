Hehe. I'm not too fond of SG myself. I've egressed across three times:
first time, nothing happened, and I was lulled in a sense of security.
Second time, an enraged ulthork got the walruses to help pound me into
the ground. Third time, I was wary, enraged ulthork was there again
but they only knocked two bubbles of health off me before I zoned.

True, but it looks spiffy. And since I refuse to wear leather anymore,
it's #2 on my list of desirable tunics; after Elysian and tied with
shroud of the Dar brood.

I primarily want a Lodi for my shield slot. It has better resists than
my SBS, my wis isn't quite capped yet, and having an EB item would be
great fun. And, like the shroud of the Dar brood, I like the idea of
an item I can put in different slots at a whim.

You know, I was actually thinking about the shimmering slime necklace
more than about the earring :) The neck is essentially a black alloy
medallion with extra stats and resists, and it isn't too rare a drop
as far as I could tell.

Heh, what's that they say about druids being the best solo classes
again? :p (No, not going to bother more with that flamebait thread)
