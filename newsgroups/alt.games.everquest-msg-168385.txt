They were definately much rarer when Kael mobs didn't drop them.

Think about guilds who were there for a year farming pre-revamp.

My guild was serious on ST BIGTIME, from January to about August we raided
ST every single 2 days, at 7am est.
I don't mean every now and then, I mean EVERY pop for months and months and
months (when 1h's were so rare you could go 16 kills without 1 - each raid
would have 3 kills).

I know not a single cleric shaman or enchanter enjoyed that..  who could
blame them.  Getting an ST key as a priest was a kiss of death to your sleep
:)
