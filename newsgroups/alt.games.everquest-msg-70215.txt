    It's a trend that was building midway through Velious - people are
posting the quests to sites like The Safehouse, Graffe's, EQCleric, or
EQTraders while it's being solved in order to get help. Then, once
completed, they forget to submit the quest to a place like Allakhazam's. The
gang at EQTraders is good about sending stuff to Allakhazam's, but the other
three are pretty bad about it.

    Having said that: check out The Safehouse, Graffe's, EQTraders, and
Allakhazam's. Alla is getting the quests and drops in, slowly but surely. If
there's something missing that you find, you can always be the first to
submit. 8) The Safehouse has a large stock of general info, and a few
"stickynoted" threads like the Class Armour quests. EQTraders has pretty
much EVERY tradeskill-related bit of info discovered so far somewhere on the
site, including *exhaustive* vendor information. Some of the newbie Vah Shir
quests are here too, as most seem to involve trades. Graffe's has less
quality discussion of SoL than The Safehouse, but more stickynoted threads
for easy access.

    Many are submitting drops, few are giving away more than "it dropped in
zone X". This has caused some tension - there was a large thread on The
Safehouse scolding one rogue who found the Vah Shir illusion mask but
refused to give away what mob it dropped from until her guild had farmed
more. As more people get out there and find stuff, more exact info will come
out. Mob info usually comes out last, as nobody wants to spend time figuring
out things like mob levels and HPs.

    Low HPs is a feature, to make mobs more soloable by casters. Instead of
putting in low-level "focus items" as promised, they just made the XP mobs
more soloable.

    Hrm? Healer/nuker, slower/haster, and the best main tank and high damage
source in the game and you weren't powerhouse? 8)

    So you've decided to go with Katta Castellum, then? (Killing the Vamps
lowers Seru factions.)
