Not from Disney, but I've never read the book nor seen more than 10 minutes
of any adaptation.  Interesting plot though...just never thought of enough
reason to rent it.  Did Mary Kate & Ashley do it? :)

Now, to totally hijack the thread, I DID finally rent "Blade Runner" after
being pointed at and ridiculed on this newsgroup.  It was ok, but only ok.
Won't bother watching it again, let alone memorizing its lines, but I'm glad
I saw it.
