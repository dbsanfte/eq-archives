A high level spell in the breeze/clarity line....at its core it increases
mana regen masively, this high level version also hasIIRC  a number of
other benefits like increasing mana pool, increased stats etc that affect
casting power. IIRC its a lvl 60 spell.

On low levellers it can effectively mean you cant cast fast enough to use
your mana.....

Its also known as C3.....and occasionally as mana crack.....

There is also a C4 variant - which most people I know grumble
about....although the effects are stunning Im told its short duration so
not so useful...
