Uh... scale up to a measly 50 or 60, or 100 tops, though and its pretty 
much the same game many of us play. Minus the chatter in PC, the buffers 
in PoK, and the hordes of sheep to buy your junk in the bazaar while you 
aren't there.

For anyone in a serious raid guild the MM of MMORPG is limited to their 
guildmates. Guess they aren't getting it either ;)

I guess you underestimate the amount of time on peoples hands.

We shall see. Perhaps the EQemu project will actually fix all the quest 
bugs in the real EQ with enough time... ;)

Or perhaps bypass the copyright issue and re-use the zones in new 
creative ways that are vastly superior to the unfortunately weak content 
lying around much of the real EQ...

Hard to say. Assuming the clients are all purchased, there is not much 
real legal meat for SoE to bite at. It would be hard for Sony to really 
control what server you connect to...despite their ToS.

Never say never.
