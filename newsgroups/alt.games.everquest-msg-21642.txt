As a weenie tank, I usually am not healed until I get to 40%.. I have no
problem with that. I do get unhappy at 20% with no spell casting by the
healer. I usually keep mend up so I can heal myself at that point. I'll pull
at 80%, but not 60%. For single mobs in the Dreadlands, I usually wait until
the main healer is at 40% before pulling.. with a well-balanced group we can
usually chain pull for an hour straight with no downtime.
