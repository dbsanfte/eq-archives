    Ok, I've had a chance to look at their web page a bit more, and other
posts in places like FoH's site. This is what I've seen:

(1) They aren't saying what it is they did. In all of their posts, never do
they say "we did this, then this, then this". You can interpret this as a
guild trying not to give out their strats, but given the suspension and how
it would be in their best interest if innocent to say what they did I feel
they feel like what they did wasn't terribly legit. At the very least, they
feel it will be looked at as "cheese" by other people.
(2) When they talk about what happened, they don't indicate that the mob in
question added on them during a fight with the boss blob that normally
inhabits that room. They talk about the "pull". That tells me that they
intended to fight this mob in the room in question. There is no physical
connection between the lower and upper room - how did they intend to do this
pull?
(3) They in no way, shape, or form could have cleared all the things that
would have been between them and the mob in question. It can take up to an
hour, with a 60 person uberguild raid, just to crawl your way from one boss
room to the other - and you're racing the repops behind you the entire time.
When they talk about the guards being clear, they mean the Akhevan Warders.

    What are Akhevan Warders? Mobs with a bajillion HPs which teleport you
to outside the castle door (essentially , they port you back to the zone
except where you end up this way you die horribly). As you kill certain boss
mobs, certain Akhevan Warders depop. So you can only go deeper in certain
directions if you kill certain mobs. Combined with the No Rent keys
throughout the zone, it is obvious to even the slowest player that stuff is
meant to be done in a certain order. Even once we get CotH'ers camped in
certain key spots throughout the zone, we'll still be doing things in the
correct order.

    Based on the GM's comments, it sounds like this is what the GM felt
happened: LoS got a monk up through the roof of the room they were in. The
boss mob in the room above aggroed on the monk. A cleric in the room below
the monk healed the monk, then the monk feigned. Since only the cleric was
on the hate list now, and since there's no path from the upper to lower room
(you get into and out of the upper area via clickable teleporters), the
upper boss mob warped down onto the raid in the lower area. Fight on!

    The sad part, if that is the case, is that fighting this particular boss
mob in her room isn't that tough. We did it for the first time, on our first
try, last night with 49 people and only one mage to supply mod rods to the
clerics. Given that it's a 30 minute fight, only having one mage is a
significant impediment. In her room, as long as you stay away from one door,
there is no risk of any adds. The only reasons I can think why you'd fight
her in a different place than normal is if you hadn't progressed far enough
to get to her, but really wanted to scoop her loots (she drops three items -
the first mob you fight that does so in the progression) or if you wanted to
skip the two-loot bosses and go straight to the three-loot bosses. Once she
dies, her room stays clear and is an excellent CotH point for the upper
bosses - it even contains a right-click teleporter to the zone-in.

    So even though LoS is a pretty likeable guild, by and large, I think I'm
going to have to believe the GM over them at this point in time. The only
thing that could really change my mind on that would be LoS spilling exactly
what they did to get the boss mob in the lower room.

    James
