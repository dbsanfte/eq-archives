I wonder why it turned in to a flame thread.  Hmmm, you couldn't have
had anything to do with that yourself, could you?

I browsed the thread and didn't see one person who had a clue how to
actually calculate the chances of this kind of "run" occuring.  I did
see one person calculate how unlikely it is for 8 particular combines
in a row to end up with the same 1-in-20 result, which is *not* the
correct way to calculate the odds.

Have you studied statistics at all?  If I were to flip a coin 100
times, could you tell me the chances that it would land heads, say, 10
times in a row?
