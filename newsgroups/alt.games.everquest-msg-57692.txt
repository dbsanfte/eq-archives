we had a guild meeting last week, were screwing around duelling and stuff
while we waited.

a guildie 60 rogue duelled a guildie 56/57 cleric (the rogues pretty damn
good at duelling)

The cleric proc'd a tash with his stick, and in his final bit of mana,
killed the rogue.   Rogues MR was about 100 unbuffed (before tash)

I duelled the cleric next (60 monk) and I won - yes i was tashed from like
the second hit too.  Whilst a lot of melees could probably kick my ass, I
personally have duelled a fair few clerics and never lost (about 120 MR
unbuffed)
