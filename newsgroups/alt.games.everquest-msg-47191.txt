My max nuke is 150 atm.  I think that goes up quite a bit when I hit 34.

Most likely it will be 2-3 of us hunting him.  31  chanter, 35 Wiz, maynb
either another Wiz or a Ranger.  We would be slightly split up and if I see
him first and am closest, I would nuke him to get his attention and pray my
friend(s) get there before he gets KSd.  If I know there are high-levels in
the zone waiting to KS and I see one of them nearby, I would attempt a charm
instead.  At that point, the others could get there and we can time a
charm-break with a double-nuke.  It would be nice if people didn't KS, but
that's not reality with the idiots in this game.

If I pull him with a nuke and then someone else nukes him ( assuming he's
not dead at that point ), I'm definitely going to try a charm IFF I know I
hit him first.  I respect camps, I never KS, but I do not believe that the
S. Ro AC is an allowed KS.  Many people see to think he is, but I disagree.

Thanks.
