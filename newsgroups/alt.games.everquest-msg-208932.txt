    Well I could never find anything about any such quest on the web, but I
thought if anyone would know, it would be one of the guys that hangs around
here. <g>

    He wasn't actually directly talking to me at the time, it was an /ooc

    I haven't heard of a quest that makes druids not root your mobs when
you're fear kiting, or teleports dickheads out the zone, but im keen if
anyone has ideas. Had one guy a few weeks back actually say "hill giants
camped". Had been KSing for hours, didn't cut it out until I announced that
I'd petitioned about him. [hate doing that but it WAS last resort]
