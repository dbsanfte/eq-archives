Surprisingly, the situation is similar for Wizards.  Wizards get
Specialization while still in their root/nuke days.  I found that my
Alteration tending to be higher than Evocation during those days, and so if
I'd just put a point in each and played normally, I probably would have
ended up an Alteration Wizard, which is a crime against nature.
