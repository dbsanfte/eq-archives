I know about Wolf Form and Oggok, but what's the best route to
good faction there?  I've checked out the various quests, and I'm
not sure which is the most efficient or comprehensive.  I don't
want to spend a lot of time on one of them only to discover
that I've been buddying up to the wrong faction group and the
main ones there hate me even more.

That one seems more difficult to me -- do yo have any leads
on good ways to get in their good graces?

One thing I know would work is repeatedly killing the troll
NPC that spawns around the druid rings in Steamfont, but
she's a rare spawn and killing her enough times could get
tedious.

I may have gotten a dozen or so faction hits "indirectly", but
the vast majority of them were done by just killing the
things personally.  I did this in my high 40's, early 50's, and
at that level it's quicker to just crush things directly.
Plus the newbie goblins in the WW zone near Cabilis are
easy kills at almost any level, and give the same size faction
boosts.

By the way, killing the mobs in Kurn's doesn't give faction boosts,
so don't go looking for raises there.  They're only useful for
the bone chips they drop, which *do* give faction standing increases.
