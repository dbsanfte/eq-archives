Oh man, the boats!  The boats were great.  I didn't have an NVidia when
the boats were still running, so I never got to see them in glorious
3D.  I feel so deprived.

Did you know it's almost impossible for an Iksar SK to get to Timorous
Deep from Kunark?  You can't get in good with Firiona Vie (I spent
weeks killing goblins to get that "You counldn't possibly get any
better with Firiona Vie" and yet they still scowled at me) you can't
get in good with the Outpost guys (only faction building thing I've
found on them requires you already have good faction with them, or
killing 50+ mobs), and now the DE have both ports with both live and
undead guards, so it's impossible for me to get anywhere near the
translocators.  I have to go through PoK, trek across to Oasis, and use
THAT translocator.  Sometimes I have to FD immediately on porting in
'cause some one brought Oowomp over.  Didn't have to worry about any of
this with the boats.

I almost didn't get to see the boats.  I'm glad I did.  The boats were
fantastic.  They really need - _*NEED*_ - to get the boats reinstated.

Waiting a year for EQ2 to mature and stabalize some.
