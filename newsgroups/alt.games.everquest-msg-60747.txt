I have alot of LD problems when I'm using the shared network connection on
my home PC while playing on my laptop (keeps wife happy cause I'm in the
same room).  What I've found is that about 50% of the times I zone, I get
tossed back to the server select screen.  I can then re-enter the game and
everything's fine (except for the wasted time and getting removed from my
group).  This ONLY happens when I'm using the shared connection - if I
connect directly from my laptop everything works fine.

This is definitely not an ISP problem and I don't think it's a Verant server
problem either.  Must be something about the client but I can't imagine what
the difference would be.

And this has happened using 2 different ISP's (I just got DSL) and on 2
different operating systems - Win2000 and now WinXP.
