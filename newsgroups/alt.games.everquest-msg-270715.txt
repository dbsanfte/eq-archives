You do know that WoW has downtime a lot of mornings?  I wouldn't be 
surprised if I've run into as much total downtime (spaced over
the release) as EQ2 has had.  Of course, I play 5-11am ish PST on
weekday mornings, so I run into the regular maitenance a lot.

What's worse is that the UI Customization forums are unavailable at
the same time because the login server is down.
