With the exception of the video card everything is way above what Verant
suggests 600 meg PIII CPU, 512 meg of Ram, the video card is according to
Verant sufficient for a PIII system when running 512 of Ram.  I am not
adverse to buying a new video card but do not want to spend money if it will
not improve things and I see no reason now to further believe Verant's
specifications or recommendations.  I suspect the loading is made
intentionally long both to discourage character switching and to act as a
time sink.  Also it may be that Verant's hardware is not up to the new load,
as it was at best weak before and I see no reason to suspect they improved
it last weekend.  Zoning did get better with today's patch, and now the two
main issues are stability as of now I have had at least 10 crashes directly
attributable to EQ compared to 0 over the previous year.  Also the textures
which I readily concede may be a video card function are a problem, but
until I see proof that the fault is in my system and not in Verant's
programming I am unwilling to act on that issue.  Frankly, I think the vast
majority of the problems arise on Verant's end of the game and given their
previous record doubt they will either admit to them or do much about them.

My bet is most of these problems arise from three factors. First, Verant's
server hardware was not ready for the load the new graphics and the vastly
upgraded player computers put on it.  Second, the program was not
througherly tested against the most commonly configured systems among its
player population.  Finally, this game was pushed to market too early in
order to take advantage of the Christmas buying season.

Right now I doubt we will see substantial improvements until sometime in
January and for now I must conclude that despite the potentially beautiful
graphics EQ as it now stands offers less value and is far less playable than
it was last week.
