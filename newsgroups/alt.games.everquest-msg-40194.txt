} Well, why should I? You're also assuming that high quality items will
}be available for purchase. 

And, that these high quality items are not no drop.  I have no problem 
with the TLC applying to certain things.  What I really have a problem 
with, is it applying to @#$! Kobold Molars.  If something's no drop and/or 
lore, it's already protected from farming.  If TLC was only triggered by 
things that were flagged magic and not no drop, I'd have no problem with 
it whatsoever.  Then, we _could_ buy it off a mid-level.  As it is, it 
seems they're just making it harder for me to raise Odus factions on the 
basis that I was not level 10 when Warrens came out.  I don't give a 
fliegende kinderscheiss about the oh-so-lovely +a couple int cloak.  I 
_just_ want my kobold molars and other wacky quest items, so I can (a) 
raise faction, and (b) see how the quests turn out and participate in the 
story they created. 

But instead, I'll have to raise faction by killing 6,000 kobolds a newbie 
could have used for exp, instead of turning in 150 molars or so.  Well, so 
be it.  Shame the nameds always seem to get caught in the carnage, and I 
can't invite the local newbie population to come loot the thing I didn't 
even want, because it poofed.  Shame I can't offer newbies my help with 
what might be a difficult kill, because they're worried I'll make its loot 
poof.  

And it's a shame they've given us yet another issue to be on two sides of 
and whine at each other incessantly about.
