    It's not showing up for me.   Since someone just sent out the control
message without going through the due processes of getting it voted in at
alt.config, there is a pretty good chance that it might not show up on many
IPSs.

Too bad someone had to jump the gun like this, that newsgroup might have
been very helpful.

   Meanwhile, the forum I started is available to all right now.
