 Only negative thing is that FD has a casting time plus they don't get
it until level 30. All in all not too bad. Best part is if you can get
your hands on a pre-nerf Circlet of Shadows. Insta-invis and FD make for
good exploring, although Verant likes to throw see-invis or undead mobs
in the mix just for fun.
