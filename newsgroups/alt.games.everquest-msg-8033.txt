Hehe, as someone who was instantly hooked the moment he saw 'Pong' at
the tender age of 6, I can say with some authority 'You ain't seen

Have you seen the 'lobby' demo from Max Payne?  Now THAT is next
generation!  I dont know where just the demo itself can be found, but
you can download it as part of 3DBench 2001 from www.madonion.com...
Wow!
