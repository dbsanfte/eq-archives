I've been reading a lot of posts from people who've come back to EQ
after trying DAoC. Most can't put their finger on why. A few say EQ
has more variety of geography. Some say EQ seems more social. Most say
it seem to be somewhat intangible. Anyway, I have a question or two
for all you who've come back to EQ after trying DAoC - Did you try
RvR? If so, was it at a high enough level to really be useful in RvR?

What I'm wondering is....did you decide to give up on DAoC before you
got to a level where RvR was viable, or did you get there and just
didn't think it was that good? I like DAoC, but not really better than
EQ, so I'm wondering whether to stick with DAoC to experience RvR, or
to go back to EQ where I have a fairly high (level 40) character.

Thanks.

Daneel
