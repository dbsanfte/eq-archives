After 3 years I've yet to find a comprehensive enchanter site.  I have a
feeling it's because you either Get It, or you Don't.  Enchanters are
amazingly versatile and it's hard for an enchanter that Gets It to do
something the "wrong way."

Yeah, sure, most of the time our most visible uses are 1) buff people, and
2) mezz adds, but that takes up 2 or 3 spell slots?  (well, ok, and tash
stuff, but it's needed less than people think it is)  At level 58 my
enchanter is still hard pressed to choose which 8 spells he wants up at any
given time, sometimes.

The only other class that's as complex (even more complex, I think) are
bards...and I'm sure they have their own website, but even though they have
many of the same "which songs do I mem?" questions as enchanters do, they
have the added headache of having to remember how long songs last, how many
songs to twist...HOW to twist...what does & doesn't stack, etc.  In that
regard enchanters have it easy. :)
