    It's a question of mana regen for the SK, more than anything else. The
top SK's routinely outdamage the top warriors, as they have DoTs that were
designed for short fights (Blood of Hate) and can afford to cast a Spear or
two (0.5 second casting time DD). Between the DD's, the DoTs, the inherent
procs, the pet (he does add some DPS, just not a lot), the increasingly
overbalanced damage of a two hander, and the every-so-often boost from a
harm touch, SKs can really put out the damage - but only if mana regen can
keep pace.
