Understand, I'm not trying to make my ogre loved by the world (though I
don't understand why people don't love him, he's so cute, aside from eating
people, he's really a nice guy) just make life a little more convenient.
Basically if I'm not KOS in Qeynos or HHK then I have a couple extra zones
to bank in, etc.

As for it being a waste of time, I'm not planning on killing greens for
faction at any point.  If I stop leveling somewhere I'll pick my fat ass up
and move on, faction or not.  Just trying to take the first few levels to do
a little faction work WHILE leveling.  No waste of time at all.  Tend to
take my characters through HHP between 14-17 anyway, so that's nothing
unusual, just will be more beneficial for Ranke than my other goody two
shoes characters.
