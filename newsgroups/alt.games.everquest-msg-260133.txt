Planet Everquest, where in the absence of a hard wired system, an 
ettiquette system evolved.

In EQ, the hardwired rule is that the person or group which does the 
most damage gets the kill.

The EQ official policy is that whoever hits the mob first gets the kill. 
  (this "play nice policy", however, did not get put in place until long 
after the player base already had decided on an alternative solution, 
and is widely derided and usually ignored)

The ettiquette developed by the player base, however, says that whoever 
was at the spawn first, and particular whoever has been killing the 
place holders at the spawn site, owns the spawn when it pops; and that 
absent this, people can set up calenders claiming spawn sites on 
specific days, or generally observe a "spotted it and produced a force 
to go after it first" rule of thumb.

I don't see what exactly about the WOW format would prevent this sort of 
rule of thumb being developed, but I do think that the inability for the 
community to build KS force groups to ram the point down the throats of 
dissenters might help prevent such community rules from being developed.

The hardwired rule in EQ was untenable, but created conditions under 
which a "kinder, gentler" community understanding could be encouraged.

The PnP, on the other hand, is widely viewed as the last refuge of the 
scoundrel.
