Tonight (May 19) I tried to log on to the game - I got the new screens and
when I tey to log in it keeps taking me to the everquest webpage and a
little window keeps opening within the game telling me I need a valid
account to log on.  I enter my username and password and the webpage takes
me to my registration info, but I still can't get logged on.  Then some
other window opens asking me to enter a key.  I've been playing for a year
and never had a problem like this.

Any ideas?

Lou
