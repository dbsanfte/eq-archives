This also appears to be connected to the "Reset device error."  This
most commonly happens, for me, when I go LD.  I have to make sure to
quit all the way out and restart the game if I go LD.  If I just log
back in without restarting the app. then I cannot use alt-enter or I
will get the error and, of course, go LD again.
