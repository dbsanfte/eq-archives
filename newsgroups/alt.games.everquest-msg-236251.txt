How would you rate the following games?

- Horizons

- Asheron's Call 2

- Dark Age of Camelot

Here are the criteria I am considering:

Learning Curve
Interface
Casual Playability
Solo Playability
Group Playability
Questing/Quests Quality
In-game events/story
Crafting Usefulness/Fun
Economy in the game
Beauty of gameworld
Quality of Dungeons
Lore - Depth of backstory and history, continuing story?
Community - Good Fan sites/boards
Age of game
  Population of servers
  Population of newbies
Server Stability
Customer Service

Horizons has the fact that it is a new game going for it. Lots of new 
players in game. Starting out with most everyone else. Appears to have 
lots of potential. A friend of mine is playing the game and loves it.

Asheron's Call was my first MMORPG experience and I like the world of 
Dereth and its lore. The monthly events moving the story along seem like 
a very good thing. It would be fun to return to Dereth after the 
apocalypse and see the world again. I have two Asheron's Call Dark 
Majesty accounts actually, both for my daughters who love the game.

Dark Age of Camelot appeals for its setting and realm vs. realm gameplay 
in addition to being similar to EverQuest in other ways from what I 
understand. I've heard good things about the questing in this game. I 
know of some nice people I could get together with here too.

Being good for casual play would be nice as level grinding isn't a goal. 
Enjoying the journey is a goal from the lowest levels.

So what do you guys think of these games and how do you think they rate 
based on the criteria specified above? Do you feel one of them really 
stands out above the others?

Any thoughts you have would be most appreciated. :-)
