*sigh*  I should have stopped bitching. :) Okay so the thing of it is, it 
gave me a random name which was "Lelila" which I was like "okay whatever 
fine" (I'd already tried about a dozen names that were already taken - am 
I THAT unoriginal?? :( ) and hit "submit" - what do you know, the name 
the engine suggested was *taken* (shouldn't there be some way of making 
the engine NOT suggest names already taken?) and so I was like "aw screw 
it" and hit two random letters at the end of the name.  So now I'm 
Lelilali.  Which is a) hard to type and b) hard to remember the order of 
the vowels and c) not really very barbarian-ish.  My friend with the 
names fetish suggested "MacAnany" which ... is... well, say it together 
out loud.  :)  It's going to be interesting.  But, oh well.  Could have 
been worse - could have chosen a name that meant "pedophile" in German or 
whatever that one guy's name was :)

My mage (Ryouseika) is at 14, but at this point I'm so far from wanting 
to play her, I haven't even bothered thinking of names.
