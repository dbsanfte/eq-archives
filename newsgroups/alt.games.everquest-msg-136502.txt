I HATE KITH with a passion.  no matter when I have to go through it, it's always
night.  always.  I've never gone through kith during the day.  Guess I just have
poor timing.  Fortunately I have never died due to this.  Staying high on the
wall helps, as well as SoW.  I did get a train following me, but I was close
enough to the WC zone that I made it through alive, although majorly low on
health.
