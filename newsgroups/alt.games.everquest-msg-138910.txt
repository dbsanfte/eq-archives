I have limited experience on PVP servers (maybe up to lvl 5 two years ago),
but I always wondered if there were "pirates" that roam around in a pack
that just kill everyone they see.  If not then I'd think that would be fun
to start.  And then there could be "good" groups and "bad" groups, and start
something like in mad max, or waterworld.

..
And what happens on a pvp server if someone kills you these days, can they
loot 1 item, or everything or just a random one, do they get your money?
