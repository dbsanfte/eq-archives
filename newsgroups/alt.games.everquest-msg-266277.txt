First, do no harm.

Second, the culprit may not even twig that it was the meal that was at 
fault; it can take 6, 10, 12 hours or more before food poisoning hits, 
and your guy probably had breakfast, dinner, maybe some snacks.

The beauty of the chili oil or the alum solutions is that he definately 
knows immediately that its the food thats got him.  The alum may 
actually worry him that its poison, so the chili oil may be a safer 
solution, depending on how you feel about this all coming out.

The food dye solution, though, he might not twig to immediately, as he 
likely won't be looking at his mouth; this gives Annie a better chance 
at spotting the guilty party, and possibly figuring a way to humiliate 
him.  My SO says in the average corporate environment nobody is going to 
lose their job over food theft, so getting him caught isn't really a key 
issue.

I like the nasty tasting food ideas because I feel they will stop the 
practice, get hit once like this and you aren't going to feel like 
playing russian roulette to save a few bucks in the future.  But I could 
be wrong there, the criminal mind is a funny thing, they say.
