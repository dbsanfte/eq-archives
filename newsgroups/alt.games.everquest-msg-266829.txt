Like I said, I've heard your argument, and I'm not convinced by it. This 
cite doesn't seem relevant enough to me. The downloaded music was 
copied.  IGE's items aren't 'copies' they made. They are selling the 
virtual property they acquired in the game. They didn't copy anything. 

(Sure technically, on some level, it might be true the actual transfer 
of the item is implemented as a copy, then delete original operation, 
but given the original is destroyed in the process, and the process 
itself is entirely within the servers, its completely within SOEs 
oversight. And I personally beleive the courts would view "copy then 
delete original" as having 'transfer' semantics, not 'copy' semantics.

If you wanted to, you might be able to argue that they are selling 
something that isn't theirs to sell, but right off the top that would be 
fraud not copyright infringement. And in any case there are several 
sides to that debate as well.

We've run around this before, I don't think copyright applies; you 
obviously disagree, and I doubt its fruitful to run around this again 
until a case we agree is relevant appears in court.
