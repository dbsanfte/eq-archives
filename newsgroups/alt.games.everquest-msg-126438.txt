well 5% is pretty bad odds (ok downright horrible), im pretty sure  I won't
be going that route.

Just every aspect of trade skills bores me senseless.. days of insanely
boring pharming for components, days of insanely boring (and painful to my
wrist) days of CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.

You become a master {insert trade skill here} by putting stuff into a
container, and clicking combine?   Its unrealistic.. is it even fun for
anybody?  Theres no skill involved in it (skill would play a huge part in
r/l trade skill stuffs like that).

I just think the whole implementation was rushed, not thought about,
designed in 1972 etc

Admittedly I am a notoriously lazy person... I just don't see what fun
*anybody* could get from the trade skills process though?  (Not refering to
the making uber_item01, and the sense of acomplishment)

Honest question.. do you enjoy working your trade skills?   going click
click click click click for hours on end?
