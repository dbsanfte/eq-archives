Your means of escape got me to wondering if a cleric could survive the fall
into the Hole at Paineel if the cleric used that Divine Aura spell. Has
anyone ever tried it here? I'm going to create a cleric and try it out
otherwise, just for fun. I took a wood elf druid all the way to Stoneburnt
yesterday and had a blast doing it. No deaths but had awesome trains in
West, North, and East Karanas until zone. Was able to get them cut down a
little by running past various guards along the way, even though the hill
giant and griffons took out the North Karana guard in just a few seconds. I
lived and made level two from three different newbie gardens I went through.

Good way to keep your memory skills up on zones you haven't been to in
awhile. I used a female character to make the run and got 16 comments on
what a babe I was. Jeez.
