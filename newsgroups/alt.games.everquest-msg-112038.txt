Not on my server (Cazic Thule), they don't.  Only a few servers have
player-agreed lists, and they are nothing more than that.  Any guild
can choose to ignore the list, and the GM's won't do a thing about it.

The mage epic is much easier than cleric epic - not in terms of the
mobs you must kill, but the availabilty of those mobs.  Quillmane is a
pain, but it only takes one person to camp him, and the cloak can be
MQ'd - perhaps 20K.  Likewise, the Crown from Sky is very difficult but
can be bought (a guildmate purchased the crown for his epic for about
35K).  And while the crown needs a large force, it's very difficult to
KS - once you're on the right island, it's going to take another guild
quite a few hours to get up there.

In other words, the mage has a choice - he can choose to go for the
rare/difficult drops, or he can raise a lot of cash and buy the pieces he
needs.

Clerics do not have this choice.  Furthermore, Ragefire pops in an
easy-to-reach zone, and requires 12-24 people (depending on level and
equipment) to kill.  Now do you see why there's so much contention
here?  Do you see why, unless you're in a large guild and can get 12-24
people to camp with you for days on end or a similar number ported to
Skyfire within minutes, you don't have a chance at a cleric epic?
