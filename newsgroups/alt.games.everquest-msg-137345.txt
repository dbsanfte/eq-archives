No, you're not quite getting it. I don't believe *you*.

Specifically, because you're a total unknown, spouting unsupported
claims, providing as evidence your 'inside' information which any
three-month veteran of the game would know, and making some statements
(which I detailed earlier) which don't jibe with your claims.

Because it comes from the only people who would be in a position to
actually know, not from some anonymous unknown babbler on Usenet.

Not at all. Despite certain clustering in the US, the subscribers are
from all around the world and have an infinite variety of schedules. I
find it entirely believable that only 1/4 are playing at any given
moment.
