And once again you missed the whole point. If you go back you'll see
that I said was that your characters name could be banned if someone
wanted to and then I went on to show you that with a little basic
Farsi I could petition a GM and shout "Terrorist" by saying something
like: Kahir Rhom, Kahir means Hasan, Hasan is a Terrorist, Rhom is
another way of spelling roam, so his name is Terrorist roaming.
And I'm pretty sure that if I yell "terrorist name" to a GM that you
pretty much will end up with a new name next time you log on.
That's all  I was saying. And if you think that's a stretch for a GM,
when they have to take a month to get hagen dazz or they don't even
know Kermit the frog, your giving those fools way to much credit.
By the way DT, there are more than one Hasan Mohammed in the world.
And one is wanted by the feds.

Nuff' said.
