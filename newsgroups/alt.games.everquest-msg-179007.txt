There was definitely a point where Shadowknights were going begging
for groups because monks were perceived as having them outstripped in
every relevant capacity except aggro generation (although Tranq.
Staff(?) seems to help with that immensely.(

It seems like you're making my case for me in the first paragraph
above. At 5515 HPs 1333 AC fully buffed and in PoP-era gear, I was
nominally able to tank Ragefire, mostly because it's such a short
fight. Tormax and AL would make paste out of me before you can say,
"Complete Heal incoming on [[[ Target ]]]."

What really pushed monks over the top in terms of balance was their
superior damage mitigation. You had less HPs than I do currently and
probably about the same AC, but you were a *much* better tank pre-PoP
than I will be until I've got another year or so of raiding and 100ish
more AAs under my belt.

It seems like you're confusing issues here. I'm talking about pre-nerf
comparisons. Monks were #1 puller, #2 tank, #3 sustainable DPS, #2
scout, #1 melee soloer, and had no-interrupt, no-mana self-heal.
Rogues were mediocre pullers, tanked worse than rangers, selectively
useful scouts, and the *worst* soloers in the game, bar none. The only
thing they had going for them was that they were the #1 dealers of
sustainable DPS.

It seemed like a well put-together AE group could get three AAs on an
extraordinary day. I don't think anyone was AEing the Grey on Torv,
certainly not anyone I was guilded with. Monks, otoh, were getting 3
AAs steadily, day after day.

VL was always a nightmare on Torv, too. The monks didn't go there.
They went to Fungus Grove and soloed shrooms day after day.

This makes me think my experience with monks is more common than
yours. You're talking about serious low-end gear here. No haste item
until level 49 doesn't strike me as at all normal. It certainly seemed
like monks were soloing at every level, at least to the point where
they had no downtime while waiting for groups, even if the solo XP was
not always ideal.

No, but overpowering AAs that lead to lots more AAs (like dire charm
does) are the ones that really spiral out of control.

Shroud does allow rogues to scout beyond where Rangers can, provided
there are no unknown traps in the way. It lets us see if a specific
MOb is wielding a specific weapon, which may be the make-or-break
point for a raid. But, content skipping with SoS only works if you
actual do later content out of order. Unless you've figured out a way
to all-rogue groups to sneak into Vex Thal and kill mini-Atens, it's
not really content skipping.

With SoS, rogues are now *two* trick ponies. That doesn't equate with
overpowered by any definition.
