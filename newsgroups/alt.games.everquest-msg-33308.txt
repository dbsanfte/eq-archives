I don't think the druid epic requires plane travel either,
but you do have to kill 
Venril etc. 

The rogue epic is the only one I know of you must be 50 to
actually Officially start.  You can collect some items for a
subquest, because for some reason they saw fit to not have
the items you need for your epic drop every time off the
mob.  But none of the quest mobs will speak to you sub 50th
level.
