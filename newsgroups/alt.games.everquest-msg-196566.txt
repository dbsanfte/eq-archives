While that should work, I don't see the point.  I fizzle about 1 in 20 casts,
and when I do fizzle, I don't want to keep trying to cast, I want to sit back
down anyway, as I'm trying to be on my can when the next med cycle hits!

Your suggestion, it seems to me, would either: cast canna, then wait 1.1+.3+.3
seconds (1.7 seconds) and sit
-or- fizzle canna, wait 1.1 seconds, cast canna, wait .3+.3= .6 seconds, try to
sit and fail cause spell is still casting,
-or- fizzle canna, wait 1.1 seconds, fizzle canna again, wait .3 seconds, cast
canna, wait .3 seconds, try to sit and fail cause spell is still casting

None of those outcomes are preferable to fizzle canna, wait 1.1 seconds, sit

Now on reflection it occurs to me what you should have in there instead would be

/stand
/pause 3, cast 8
/pause 3, cast 8
/pause 11, cast 8
/sit

This will have you standing longer than my original macro also (still 1.7
seconds standing time) but will always wait at least 1.1 seconds after a
successful cast before trying to sit, so you'd never miss a sit time.  If
attentive to the med cycle, 1.7 seconds should still be well more than enough
time to be sitting again before the next tic.

I suppose I'm a luddite, but I haven't been very tempted to try a new UI.  The
default "new UI" has most of what I want, even though its kind of Kludgy, and I
figure its the one most likely not to get screwed up by SOE changes.  Since
"patch day" is the main raid day for my guild (its when most of the mobs we like
to kill are guaranteed to be up, and up during the american daytime, which is a
Euro guild's night) I really want the best chance of being able to play on those
post patch days.

I'm also an odd combination of incredibly lazy and driven; things I'm interested
in (like the shaman/cleric Snare item) I'll devote days of effort to, but things
that I'm not really into, I leave go.  Hence I'm still using Netscape 4.7
despite troubles with some web pages.  6.1 sucked, I went back to 4.7, and I
haven't taken the time to go to 7.0 like people say (or Opera, which I think I
may have a copy of on a floppy somewhere!  Talk about the opposite of
Bloatware!)
