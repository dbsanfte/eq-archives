I'm was all set to say that Trolls rule. I'm on Xev, and we're down for
most of the evening, so I went on another server and stated up a bare
naked troll warrior to get used to the race/class/hunting area. I made
level 4 in about an hour and some minutes.  And this is without the
twinking I want to do on mine on my regular server. (Before that debate
starts, I'm talking about a backpack, most of a set of tattered leather,
and a FS long sword and enough cash for several stacks of food on his
first out of town trip.)
  But I'm now wondering if it's just because I already played seven
other characters, knew mostly where to go, what to do, how to live, etc.
and it just goes faster now? Or are Trolls that much better on their
home turf? Hrmmm... interesting.
  Anyway, not being a warrior type normally, I finally decided to set up
keys for my autoattack, a kick key, a social "slam" key that also does
taunt and sense heading, a real Taunt key, a bind wounds and a loc.
Seems like a nice first set, but I'm open for improvements.
  Thanks for all the help.
