I was trying to remember if I had killed any mobs that raised my
faction with the merchants but not guards, but as far as I recall, my
necro has hunted only in Nek Forest and the only mobs she hunted that
involved faction were the Leatherfoot Halflings (which lowers various
factions in Rivervale) and the orcs (which I think raised my faction
with East Common Residents, the Freeport monks and the Knights of
Truth, but not the Freeport Militia or Freeport merchants).  

I'm just wondering if it has anything to do with the fact that the the
lowest faction you can have with merchants is Dubious (you'll never be
KOS to them) while one can be KOS to guards?  In other words, the
faction range is larger for guards than it is for merchants so would
require more work to raise faction?
