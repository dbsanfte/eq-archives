Hi Probis, thanks for the info.  As for apologizing, no.  It was a debate
between us.  I just wanted some more info and opinions about it from others.
I have ordered, payed and received the puter.    I was under the impression
when I ordered the machine I was getting an Anthlon and didnt.  Received a
duron instead.  Anyways, I should have known better because it was so cheap.
But I do appreciate all the great information on this.  Have a nice day.

Sheri  :)
