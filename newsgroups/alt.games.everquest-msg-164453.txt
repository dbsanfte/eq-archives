My dad made my mother a shelf that spans the tub big enough to where she
could play doublehand solitaire in the tub (she did that or read or
crossword puzzles every night for an hour). Surely such a shelf is big
enough for a lap top with optional mouse.... just have a towel handy for
drying off your hands every now and then.
