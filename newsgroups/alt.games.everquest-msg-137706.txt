First off, let me justify this recommendation by stating that I play a
Dwarven Paladin
as my secondary main character. I play an Enchanter as my primary main.
Either of
these would be a good choice with a Monk for the following reasons:

    Monk/Paladin - Paladin provides healing, good tank ability, a GREAT
damage shield
                            for the monk, and some of the best taunting
around short of a full warrior.

    Monk/Enchanter - Enchanter provides the buffs, debuffs, roots, mez (when
monk pulls too
                            hard and has to FD), DD and DOT ability, a pet,
quickness line of spells,
                            and whirl/stun spells. (what can't fight the
monk, can't HIT the monk)
