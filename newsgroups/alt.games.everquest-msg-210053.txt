Well the Ogre will have a harder time of it than the Human. Skill increases
are helped by Int/Dex (which ever is higher) but that isn't really the issue
here so don't start thinking you need to by Int or Dex gear for it.

The level 1 - 10 "journey" was made quicker, fairly recently. So you are
often going to find you haven't max'd any set of combat skills except
perhaps offense by 10th level.
Yes you will start to max them later as the mobs will last longer and the
levels take more kills to get thru. By 30 you will be max'ing skills
(assuming it was max'd to previous level cap) by the first yellow of exp.
