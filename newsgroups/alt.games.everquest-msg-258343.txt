See, I'm not so interested in an exception for just me.  An exception for 
just me would be silly quibbling over 30 DPS or so.  Our raids are wiping 
most often because our DPS just wasn't quite up to snuff.  Now I figure, 5 
enchanters with 5 animations, and without people complaining about our 
nukes... (Yes, of course, we nuke anyway when the raidleader starts 
crying BURN!! and we're watching the cleric team go down...)  That might 
add up to a fair good chunk of DPS, there.  And if we can get the shamans 
and SKs and whatnot to bring -their- pets, too, /pet hold or no, it might 
actually improve our chances.  But I'd really like to know what all the 
possible issues are, and workarounds, before I go actually, say, 
-suggesting- such a radical idea on our messageboards...

>Basic rules 
>1. pay attention
>2. pay attention

Yea, we covered that one.  Not that I don't think it warrants 
over-covering. :)

>3. immediatly /pet hold when you see "You get raid experience"
>4. anytime you can't remember if you hit /pet hold, hit it.

I think, personally, I hit /pet back off about twice that often. :)

>5. wait for assist to be called
>6. ONLY then do you send in your pet

Yep yep. /agree.

>7. PAY ATTENTION TO PET POSITIONING!  Both for push and to keep it
>   from eating an enrage.

Well... I definitely agree on the push, as I said, but for my own pet, 
tiny daggers are cheap.  And by the time enrage hits, he's done his damage 
for the fight anyway. :)

>Did I mention pay attention yet?

No, no, don't think you mentioned that. :) Or maybe I just wasn't paying 
attention. :)

>People who didn't follow some variation of these rules got a warning
>then TL'd out if they didn't pay attention.

We'll just flame them on the messageboards until they apologize. :)
