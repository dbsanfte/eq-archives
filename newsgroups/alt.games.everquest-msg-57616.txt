>>> it just bothers me that they use languages as an excuse for their
behaviour. <<<

They do this in real life too. I was stationed in Korea, and we have Korean
soldiers that are assigned to the Army posts. When they want something,
their English is perfect. I've even heard some of them talk better English
than the American soldiers.

But disciplining them is extremely tough, because all they have to do is say
the three magic words:

"I don't understand"

and the higher-ups let them off with a warning. Not even a stern warning. No
wonder it took up drinking in Korea.
