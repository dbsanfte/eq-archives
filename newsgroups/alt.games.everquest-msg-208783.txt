This topic comes up alot, and there are a few ways to go about it.

The fastest for my character was to hunt for plague rat tails in West
Freeport
enough to get a sewing kit.  Then hunt skellies and bears in Everfrost,
making patchwork armor for resale to either players for a few silver over
the cost of the patchwork from the vendors, or to the vendors themselvs.

Save all silks, bone chips, L/M/H pelts for sale in the bazaar.

When you have a few stacks of bone chips and some pelts, go to the
bazaar and /auction them off to the other vendors at slightly below the
lowest cost in the search window.  You will get vendors online that will
buy from you quickly.

The progress for tailoring to 35 or 37 to make pelts is not hard, but
you have to raise blacksmithing for the studs.  Might be less time consuming
to just sell componets to the vendors or others wanting skillups.

On rare occasion, I have come across a stack or two of silks in a vendor,
I buy them and sell them quickly as well.

The other route is brewing Heady Kiolas....I have had my inventory of
over 600 bought by *one* person, and that was at 6p5g each.  I happend
to be online when this occured, and the woman basically said that she would
never brew another, even if it were 10pp each....she was sick of doing some
of the componet combines.  Get brewing up by combining a water flask and a
fishing grub to make fetid essence, sell back to vendor.   DO NOT be
discouraged the first few hundred combines, you will get your skill up in
short order.  With good charisma, each combine should run you 1s3c, and you
get some of that back in resale.

Now for the more difficult way, bazaar stock exchange.  I regularly buy any
kiola or padding that is underpriced, stick them on my resale character, and
always have some.  The idea is I price the items a little higher than others
as
that way there is always some around for those that are in need and do not
care about a plat or two, or three.  Folks sell leather padding from 11pp to
30pp, and I buy up most under 21, for sale at about 27 to 30.  Sometimes it
takes a few days to move, but, *point here* it moves eventually.  Same with
folks brewing up 100's of kiolas and trying to sell at 3pp each, I come in
buy
them out entirely, and *poof* the price is now 5-7pp again.  Some folks
complain,
others just are happy they don't have to do the combines them selves.
