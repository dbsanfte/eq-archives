As someone who plays a rogue, go to Cazic at that
level, almost everygroup i was in, wanted an
enchanter, and often times most spawns were
camped.  Don't tell me people don't go to the
dungeons.  I have spent most of my time in them. 
Mistmoore also loves enchanters, some nights yes
mistmoore did seem somewhat dead, but other nights
it was overcamped.  I can't speak for your server
with out knowing it, but on Erollisi Marr the
dungeons have not been utterly abandoned, you just
have to know which ones to go to.
