Yeep, you only need keys, you can run eq twice on the same machine.
But.
1, The only way to get the CD keys, is buy the game again, including
expansions.
2, you will need quite a powerful machine to run eq twice, with good
performance, switching between the two chars.

As i take it, u would be PLing your second account chars, and that
heal could be to late, if your comp, dosn't switch in time.

2 comps is much better :D

Good luck
