To whom, naature boy, you?   I had several players scream high and low letting
all the newbies join our guild.  Before opening your mouth perhaps you should
stop first and say to yourself, " I am not everybody, everybody doesn't want to
experience life in the same was as I do."  It hel you, trust me.   Our guild is
one that allows anyone to join, but then we have degrees of experienced
playerrs within the group.  The 57 Wiz will spend a little of his time working
with the single digits answering questions.  Our 52 lvl druid will teach the
single digits how to kite even if it has to be on a rat.  We get a kick out of
loading two "druid buses" with newbies and taking them to a new place to hunt,
and returning them home safe and sound.  Sure, some opinionated -this is
the-only-way-to-do-things "person" will see our tag and think "oh that's the
stupid guild that recruits anyone "   But that's ok, we'd eventually weed that
character out of the guild anyway;).

Imagine the horor of it, a guild with an open membership who actually wastes
their time mentoring newbies just so those nobodies can enjoy EQ.   

What a fking idiot guild we are!  LMAO

Enjoy
