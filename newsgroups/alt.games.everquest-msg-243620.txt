But there are develpers on the boards at EQ Traders, and they have quite 
a good relationship with the board owner, to the point of EQT mentioning 
disparities in tradskill item drop rates, and the devs looking into the

Actually, the devs said they got ideas on the new tradeskill interface 
from feedback from EQTraders posters...
