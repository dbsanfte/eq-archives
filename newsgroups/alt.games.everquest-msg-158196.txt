I have never seen any clear evidence that haste has any effect on
proc rate.  Procs are handled by scripts, and there is no shortage
of hidden parameters.  It doesn't seem to make any difference to
my average proc rate for Instrument of Nife whether I wield a 26
delay one-hander or a 49-delay two-hander for instance.  I have not
had enough contrast in Haste percentage to say whether that has an
effect or not, but I've learned not to assume anything about the
byzantine mass of spaghetti involved in resolving combat in EQ.
