LOL, now that is a rationalization.

Are they harm animal spells? Aside from fear, which can be used to save
an aggressive animal.

Clearly there is no balance of nature in the EQ world, but if there were
how would a druid go about maintaining this balance? I doubt that anyone
would agree that killing hundreds of animals of every kind, specifically
for their hides falls into that description.

All that aside, the EQ druid bears little resemblance to a guardian of
the balance of nature. I just think things would be much more
interesting if one lost faction by killing animals, and there were quests
for raising animal faction. It is not a big deal, but from my interaction 
with other players, including newbie players it is clearly what people 
expect.

You could still be a druid tailor, just don't expect wolf and bears to
run up to you wagging their tails, or leave you alone while you med.
