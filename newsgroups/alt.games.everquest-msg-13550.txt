With cable, yes you're right, simply because every user in a given area
shares access on the same main trunk.  With DSL, ISDN or even a POTS
connection with a modem, you have a dedicated line direct from your
house/apartment to the CO, which by it's very definition makes it a heck of
a lot more secure than cable.  Not tamper-proof, but much more secure.
