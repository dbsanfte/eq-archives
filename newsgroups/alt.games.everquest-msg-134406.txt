    Cool, so ancient spells really WERE put in game (although only on one

the pet haste cap problem.

    We have enough new members that a trip to NToV will always benefit us.
And it's fun to beat up the old loot pinatas one more time! (I love that

    Leave it to Verant to find a way to mess up content to the point of

of Vulak, Lord Inquisitor Seru or any of the named from Inner Acrylia could
spawn at the end?
