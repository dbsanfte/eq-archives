OFF TOPIC:  But I wanted to respond to this concept

Reverse the levels, same question.

Same answer though:

No.  Not the way you seem to think that the game is/should be played.

But, if played properly... any level char in any level dungeon (what do you
mean "unmodified" do you mean one I didn't write?  Why the hell would THAT
be any fun?) can, should, and will have fun.

Of course, push a properly played 5th level character to stand toe to toe
with a Vampyre "Lord" and the proper player runs as fast and as far away as
he can...

Unless of course she has a suicide complex...

"The assassin's on the street three stories down?  Gee, I wonder how he got
down THERE so fast...  Is the window open?"

DM: "yes."

"I'll jump out.  Can I land on the assassin?  To break---"

DM: "His back?"

"---my fall."

DM: "You can try... uh... roll."

"Oh, and sword down... I want to pin him to the sidewalk."

The "battle" lasted about one tenth of a second... I "won" handly on a
single die roll.  But ask any of the people who were there... that was a FUN
night.  And they still talk about a battle that lasted a tenth of a second.
