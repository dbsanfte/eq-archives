Precisely my point. Davian says 75k items drop in Velious and other old 
zones... and I'm not disputing that. But for the current midlevel crowd 
working their way up, camping those 75k items are not remotely realistic 
goals nor efficient uses of their play time.

Fortunately I'm not asking them to drop 75k items. To revitalize a zone 
like Kael they merely need to increase the drop rate of the quest items 
for the no drop armor, and possibly parity the stats of that armor with 
mid-upper level ldon gear ... the existing velious armours aren't that 
bad... but they can't be farmed efficiently until much higher levels, at 
which point there are better places to hunt and gear up. So there is no 
reason to hunt in Kael.
