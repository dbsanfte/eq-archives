I would have to agree that bards are the least chatty. Its hard to type long
sentances when you are twisting songs - how much can you type in 3 seconds?

As for when they come into their own? I think we are all forgetting the real
class defining ability - Level 5 (Selo's Accelerando) - Enchanters get charm
before us!
