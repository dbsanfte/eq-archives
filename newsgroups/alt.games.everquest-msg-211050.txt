Not only are the books a huge advance in transport over the way we used to
move around, their existance and prevalence means that "the way we used to do
it" has largely vanished, like horse drawn carts have largely vanished since
the introduction of the automobile.

Once upon a time, there were druids and wizards everywhere advertizing their
porting services, and a bit later when chat channels were introduced, you
could go to your server's "taxi" channel and get a ride to show up wherever
you were to take you where you wanted to go.

There are still a few taxi's operating, mostly taking people to more out of
the way spots like Cobalt Scar or Stonebrunt... but they are sort of like the
horse drawn cabbies that will take you for a ride thru central park; an old
fashioned abberation to be found only in large cities in the main.  There's
rarely one around where you want one, and there aren't many of them anyway.

This means that without POP you are sort of playing the game the way it was
shortly after release, when there were few wizards and druids out there high
enough level to have the port spells at all.
