    Hey you might be right, I don't actually PLAY a ranger, but on the other
hand I've yet to meet a ranger 39-55 who didn't think the class was badly in
need of some sort of balancing. Even if it's only peoples *perceptions*
there's loads of evidence ive seen that they get overlooked when LFG and
have huge amounts of trouble soloing.

    Even just comparing what I know of my own class to theirs, I know for a
fact that if I have to put up 3 or more "LFG" messages in DL its because
there's only 8 people in the zone... and soloing...... well I've been able
to fear kite anything that doesn't resist since god knows when (only really
tried fear kiting in my 40's DOH sillyme) and when fear breaks... well... I
*am* a tank. Plenty of hp and AC buffer for a recast.

    Yes rangers get uber powerful in their 60's and with AA etc, but who
doesn't? One look at the SK spell lineup at that end of the game makes me
absolutely come in my pants. Enough DOTs alone to kill my lvl 49 character 3
times over?! Enough *NUKES* to kill him in 3 seconds flat?! A *pet* that I
would have to fear kite to beat?! Yayo, rangers can do huge amounts of dmg
with a bow..... does it really make up for being unwanted in groups and near
incapable of soloing until then?

    Yada yada etc plenty of room for argument there about a better player
making better use of the class. But seriously there are classes which
someone with half the braincells required to solo with a ranger (or even an
SK for that matter) can do just fine.
