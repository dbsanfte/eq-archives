I just started playing EQ for the first time.  I bought the EQ Trilogy and
The Shadows of Luclin.  I thought the Vah Shir looked really exciting so I
decided to make a Vah Shir Shaman.  I'm having an absolute blast and
everyone has been very kind with my dumb questions.  I am however having
some problems with my spells.  It seems I cannot buy some of the more
helpful offensive spells to a Shaman of my level (9).  I'm speaking of
Sicken and Tainted Breath, as well as Flash of Light.  Without these spells
I find my usefulness in a group is very limited.  I'm not really sure where
I can get these spells or if it is even possible to survive the run if I
knew where to get them.  I was hoping someone could offer some advice to a
newbie on how best to obtain these spells.  Thank you for any advice anyone
has.
