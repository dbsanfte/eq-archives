I started at 51...  One thing I can say, depending on where you are, it is
also a good excuse for leveling slowly for some reasons.  My Druid is
currently 53 now, with 2 points under the belt, both going to improving Wis
right now, but I am now thinking of putting some into Run speed now that
you mention it.  By soloing/camping IGs in Everfrost since 49, you can make
some reasonable money while leveling there.  Yes, it is slow, tedious and
tortuous, but then, if you have a hard time being on for long periods of
times to get into a decent group, or doing something even extremely silly,
like financing 7 other characters and their gear, then it is somewhat a
worthwhile venture to milk it as much as you can.

Now, I have heard the arguements that you should get up to 60 because you
will have the larger manapool if you are a caster, or more hitpoints to
make it more worthwhile than to get medium returns doing it at 51 and
taking longer.  Personally, doing it sooner, for the reasons I mentioned
above and now more so with dstep's reasons, makes it seem worthwhile to try
sooner than later.  The ones who were already at the higher levels can say
this cause they are dealing with 50+ mobs in raiding groups or finding some
45-49 level mobs with other groups or dealing with lots of light blue mobs
in small groups to watch the bar go faster, and waste them faster, at the
same time, they are no longer worried about getting to the next higher
level, since they are maxed out.  XP Gain for Level of a 59 is > than AAXP,
since AAXP is somewhat around 50-51 in measurement, so by the time you hit
58 to 60, the concern about XP for the next level is almost ignored, but
given the amount of light blues, with it dumping fully to AAXP, they can
gain points in AAXP a bit more noticeably faster than doing it on the way
up.

It REALLY depends on when you want to see the benefits of AA.  I wanted to
get extra Wis on my Druid, and now hearing about the Runspeed, I might put
in some points there so I don't need to worry about Sow or Wolf Form
Dropping if I want to maybe slightly outrun a mob chasing after me inside a
dungeon, or even outside.
