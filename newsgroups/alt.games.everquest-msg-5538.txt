They both can be important.  STR mostly just so you can wear armor and still
loot.  Stamina for swinging 2 weapons when you hit 16 or 17.

However, you have songs that counteract both deficiencies.

Hmmm, assuming that your STR on the 2nd is 85 I agree with you...go with
that one.  STR items are easy to come by, as are DEX and AGI.  You'll also
want to pick up CHA items here and there but there's no rush.
