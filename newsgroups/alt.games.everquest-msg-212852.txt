Tried to start the Ghoulbane quest tonight - looks easy on paper and I
already have the Amstaff component from HH. However can't find Ryshon
Hunsti.

Camped his spot for over an hour (killed ghouls to relieve boredom!). Does
anyone know if he is a rare spawn or linked to some other activity before he
does spawn?

Thanks.
