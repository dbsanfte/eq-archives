    COH was well thought out.
    They smartly avoided the major annoyance factors on most online games.

    If the programmers and designers know that they are doing things right,
then it is absolutely smart to avoid bad advice.
    EverQuest sucked when I played it mainly because it was damn obvious
that the company running the game HATED their customers (and given the level
of pissing-off that Verant unleashed upon their customer base --- that was a
mutual-hate relationship).
