After Final Fantasy proved it would work (The 'average' jp player has 
3.5 chars, the average us player has 2.5, according to the last census) 
I'm surprised more companies are not looking at similar tricks.
(Final Fantasy method, in a nutshell:
$12.95 a month gets you your account and one 'content ID'. An account 
can hold up to 16 Final Fantasy content IDs.
$1.00 per month gets you an additional Content ID.
You do not need a worldpass (in-game issued number to allow someone to 
get onto your server) to put your alts on the same server you are, or 
they get assigned a random server like everyone else (if you don't have 
another server's world pass that's active atm).
However, in a flip of their pay for alts logic, you can change jobs with 
minor effort (earning a few of the advanced jobs can be tricky though), 
so if you are happy with your race and name, you can, and in fact some 
do, play a dozen different jobs with one character.
My character is a 34 monk, 16 Samurai, 15 Warrior, 15 Thief, 13 Red 
Mage, 6 White mage, 6 Ranger, and 2 Black Mage
