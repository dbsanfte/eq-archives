    Don't think I've ever done that run myself... but assuming there are
people in their 30's who can't navigate worth a damn..... what's your point?
If there are druid in their 30's too dumb to solo should the game have an
auto-solo button?

    Maps of starting cities are already provided in the books, but with the
key difference that they dont provide ingame reference to WHERE you are in
those cities. Learning to navigate SHOULD begin then, delaying it only means
players will get lost trying to find the zone and die at a higher level when
it matters more.

    Honestly, travel has no meaning any longer, soon navigation INSIDE zones
wont matter anymore? Why not just release EQ as a video game? Oh wait, they
have...
