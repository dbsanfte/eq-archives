The whole "rotten XP" thing is to where I'm about to tell my mates that when
we have 7, I'll either drop out of the hunt or go solo alongside them (I'm
usually one of the higher ones) so that instead of all of us getting crappy
raid XP, at least they'll get decent XP.  I'd rather do that and get the
occasional kill thanks to pet/nukes than to have everyone penalized into
getting next to nothing.  Come to think of it, 1-2 kills would give me the
same XP as I'd normally get for the night on a 7-main raid.

It is very annoying to fight for 3-4 hours and after a 96% rez, you're back
where you started.
