Your statement just got me thinking about how much DPS I am really doing, 
and, I know that it is still less than the real DPS classes, but, it is 
higher than I really expected it to be also,.  If it's a choice between a 
ranger and a shaman, sure, the ranger should keep killing, and the shaman 
should take care of rooting the mob off.  Realistically, in a grouping 
situation, my DPS is a lot lower, as I have a lot of other things to do 
with my mana, so, can't say I'd even argue for the Paladin taking care of 
it, unless it's a mob that I really don't want hitting me for any period 
of time to speak of.

I suspect that if I am going full out for sustained DPS vs non undead 
mobs, I can probably outdamage a similarly equipped and AA-ed paladin.

So, I guess, it just got me thinking about it really.  Generally, I am 
the one who ends up with rooting off an add or two, as I can snag it 
easily with slow, and once slowed, it's easy to root it off.  Druid is 
often a good choice for this too though, as snare works great for agro, 
and give the druid time to root the mob without getting hit.  Same 
applies for a ranger.  Paladins are excellent for this because they can 
also grab agro fast, and root while the mob is stunned, not to mention, 
they take a beating better than I do. A lot depends on the mobs in 
question really, as to who is best suited to the job.
