Since you obviosley know the consequences of powerlevelling a character, I
won't go into it, though I will say that the skill loss IS reverseble. :o)
Now, I powerlevelled my warrior in Rathe Mountains, on the skeleton camp by
the Feerrott zone, till about 25ish. VERY good place to hunt. Unless you get
that big level 50+ skeleton. ;o) Now, again, I agree with the others, get
someone to supply a druid. They are the best for powerlevelling :o)
