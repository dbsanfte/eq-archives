So I started this chanter and he's only lvl 24.  I knew they were a pretty
group dependant class, but I've heard a few people say that they are not bad
soloers either.  Now, I prefer to have a group, but sometimes there just
aren't any, especially at lower levels.  So, what are some strategies for a
solo chanter?  Can a chanter solo?  I've tried charm kiting, but the charm
always breaks and I usually die before I can recast it, or I recast it but
by that time I've got so many adds that I'm dead anyway (best place I've
found to solo is MS because I have alot of room to run around, but you get
about a million adds there).  When I was like 10 or 11 I soloed some giant
bugs in the commonlands by fear kiting (my necro roots showing through) but
without a snare I'd end up running half way across the zone after a bug
which would probably head straight for a guard anyway.  From what I've
experienced chanters are not very good soloists at all.  Oh, that was kinda
alot of rambling...here's my questions again: What are some strategies for a
solo chanter?  Can a chanter solo?  What zones (if any) are good for soloing
at 24?
