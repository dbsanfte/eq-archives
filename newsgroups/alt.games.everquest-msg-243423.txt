I feel strongly that gnomes make a much better enchanter.  But I may well 
be biased. :)  Why would you choose troll ptahetic regen over ogre 
not-stunnable-from-the-front?  High elves suck, period.  They may have 
their points, except for the fatal flaw of having to look like a high elf.
And they make really lousy bards. :)  

But seriously, choice of race isn't subject to a 'best for class' thingy.  
Any advantage given by any tiny stat variation or special racial skill is 
going to be heavily outweighed by 'having to go around looking like an X' 
for 65 levels.  Be the race you feel comfortable being, or that you most 
identify with.  That will bring you much more long-term happiness than 
being the race that got an extra point of hp regen or 5 extra int.
