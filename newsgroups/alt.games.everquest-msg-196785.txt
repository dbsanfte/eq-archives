You need the Shadows of Luclin expansion to get to the bazaar.  To get there
you need to take one of the portals (four curves spires sticking up out of
the ground with a Scion in the middle).  They are located in N. Karana,
Toxxulia, Gfay, Dreadlands and Great Divide(the last two won't work for you
because you won't be able to get to them)  You get a shard from the scion
(sorry been a while, I can't remember the phrase) and then wait and you will
be ported up to the Nexus.  From the Nexus there are four halls, one at each
direction.  For the Bazaar you need to enter the South Hall (I always
remember it because it is S for Sell)

Or if you have the Planes of Power expansion you can take any book (they are
in all of the newbie zones) to the Plane of Knowledge (POK).  From POK you
find the portal that goes to the nexus and from there follow the same
instructions as above to the bazaar.
