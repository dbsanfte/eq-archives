Why would they want to kill the mac version? Every VPC for Mac they sell 
comes bundled with an MS OS, and opens an opportunity to sell a copy of 
MS Office. Macs can already access Exchange and Terminal Servers and pay 
the relevant licensing fees... what exactly would the point of killing 
that mac version be?

As to your second suggestion... its likely they don't want users to 
emulate linux, but then there aren't that many users looking to do that 
either. And with Microsoft VPC 2004 you still can, so cutting that out 
wasn't a first priority. And if you think about it, why would they be 
terribly concerned about linux emulation anyhow? They're afraid people 
would spend $200.00 on XP, and another $200.00 on VPC in order to run 
Linux??? It would be cheaper just to buy a used 2nd box, network them, 
and use telnet or X to access it in a window, and it would run better 
like that too (vpc only has a 4MB S3 for a video card...)

The linux adoption crowd is interested in running XP in a window to 
access windows apps when there is no linux equivalent; they aren't going 
to spend a pile of money to run XP and emulate linux in the window, it 
just doesn't make sense.
