Of all the reasons I've heard about why someone doesn't want to play EQ2,
the simple "I'm still enjoying EQ and don't feel like switching games" is
the one I respect the most.  Those who like EQ...play EQ. Those who have
lost interest in EQ because it stopped giving us what we wanted...well,
our time may have come. :)  We can hope anyhow. And if not, there is
HOrizons, Wow, and whateverSigilHasComing to try out as well.
