Guys, thank you for your opinion and advice.
I don't see Beastlord on the manual. Is it something new available today or
I have to have latest expansion game for that?
I just got EQ trilogy and played tutorial kind of stage not very familiar
with this game.

So bard and cleric is a bad idea for solo I guess. But may be easy to find
group to accept them since they can be helpful to buffing and healing
others?
Do you guys stick with the same group every time you log in or just find
buddy to go with for a quest for the day?
