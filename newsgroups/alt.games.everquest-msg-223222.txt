This is one of those things I never understood for the first 25 years of
my life (because my doctor didn't tell me).  I'd always assumed that it
was the degree of correction that put the upper limit on my visual acuity;
It wasn't until I took my new contacts to have the fit adjusted, and 
(being a garrulus sort) sat and talked with the gentleman who made my
lenses about it, that I learned that wasn't the case.  Between him and 
my new doctory, I have a far better understanding of where my vision
problems lie than I ever had before.

Correct - looking straight at the middle of the line (IE not actually
trying to read the line) is when I see effect.

I'm pretty sure she did that for my first visit - but I don't think I
asked the purpose.

Detached/torn retinas are something my doctors have warned about for many
years.  They were very unhappy that I played organized basketball from age
6 to 30 (when I blew out my knee).  Until I got contacts at age 13, I used
to get hit in the side of the head frequently - a result of having no
peripheral vision to speak of.  When I was twelve I had my glasses broken
on my face (the outside of the lense gashed my cheek where it was forced
against it) and I had to take my free-throws functionally blind - I made
1 of 2 :)
