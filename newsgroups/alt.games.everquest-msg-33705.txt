Even if you realized that the "facehugger" had implanted
something in him (and they were careful not to be *too*
specific about that), there were a ton of possibilities as
to what might happen as a result, including for example him slowly
mutating into some hideous creature, or mysteriously dying
then coming back as a zombie, or even puking up an alien, etc. etc.

There were so *many* places they could have gone next that
I find it hard to believe that it was "so obvious" that in the
middle of an "I feel better" dinner scene, he was suddenly going
to go into convulsions and have an ugly alien baby with big fangs
literally rip itself out of his chest, spraying blood on everyone
around, in a very graphic manner -- especially in a film that
had faked out the audience by being almost glacierly slow and
understated up until that scene, and in a movie era where
such things Simply Were Not Done.

While some people may have expected something like it anyway,
and perhaps you were one of them, I disagree that it should
have been "so obvious" that a violent, blood-gushing
chest-bursting scene was coming.
