I would, and have on occasion. Gotten into fights over it too. Didn't
win all of them either, but I'd do it again. Wanna' try me?

Charles Caplan, Columbia SC. Post me a reply and we can set up a time
and place. You'll have to come to me though, because i'm not gonna'
travel too far to make a point.

As for the rest of it:

I agree, the OP was a Dick.

That's one of the things I like about Firiona Vie, Trivial Loot Code.
The one character per account thing, keeps the level of twinking alts
down and most loot is dropable so you can just buy what you want in
the bazaar, usually. Makes it a very plesent server to be on.

I've gone in to places where I can farm greens for trade skill items
or faction, but if a group comes in and actually wants to use that
place for Exp, it's all theirs. Or I offer to PL them or help them
pull spawns, or generally just heal them in exchange for the items I'm
looking for, or just to get a piece of the faction hit.

You have to be paitent with noobs sometimes, and it sounds like the OP
got a pair of true noobs.

Bottom line is the OP got mad, lost his temper and proceded to be a
royal dick about it.

Were they of a compareable level or trying to use the place for the
same thing (camping items, etc...) then there would be a different
story.

What the two noobs did wasn't right, they should have been more
willing to talk, but that dosen't make the rest of it right.
