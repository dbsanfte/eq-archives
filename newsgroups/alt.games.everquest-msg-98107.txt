Thats because enchanters rock, are one of teh most powerful and sought out
classes in the game... lets face it, if a 50th enchanter and a 50th paladin
put up LFG tags at the same time, who's gonna get a group faster?

Actually, you do defend yourself when LD. If something is attacking you you
will fight the mob... not very intelligently but you will fight it. When the
Swarm was in NK, we went to kill the Swarm Mother. Midway thru the fight the
Wizard went LD, she continued to attack the SM and wound up getting the kill
makeing the corpse go poof.

Also, just yesterday I was pulling a 40th level mob to my group... I went LD
on the trip and I was pretty sure I would be dead when I came back. I came
back at 60% health and mana and my group said... where's the mob? I had
killed it while LD.
