I've been on both sides of the equation with this one. At level 16, I
lost my first character's corpse in the twisting, turning passages of
Upper Guk. In frustration, I quit the game for about three months. I
also played a necro up through level 55. Soloing 22-32 in FM and 47-52
in Burning Woods, I wound up anon most of the time because, if I
didn't, I'd get at least one tell an hour from someone with a lost
corpse who *needed* me to track it down. All I wanted to do was get
through those levels so I could play with the real life friends who
introduced me to the game, not spend 3/4 of the time helping every
person who wasn't able or didn't remember to get a loc before dying.

I don't see how being forced to spend hours or inconvenience total
strangers to recover days (or more) worth of work enhances an
entertainment form. I don't see how wandering around lost because
every tree looks the same or because you can't find the zone tunnel
does either. I don't see how having to shout "I need the loc to xxx,
please," helps make this a better game.

SOE has introduced a lot of features that smooth out the game for new
players. And, with a mature product like EverQuest, they'd damned well
better. On both of my servers' boards, I see veteran players posting
their goodbyes more or less every week. If EverQuest is going to have
any legs (which I believe it will,) it's going to need regular
infusions of new players who don't quit in frustration over one of the
game's many quirks before they've had time to find out why the game is
worth the effort.
