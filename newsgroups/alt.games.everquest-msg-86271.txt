Yes, I've read that too, but the "most" certainly leaves the issue
open as to whether it covers weapon skills or not.  And since
the use of "most" strongly implies that there are skills where
INT is irrelevant, one would expect that something as reflexive
as practicing weapons would likely be the sort of skills which
don't depend on INT.

But I'd be interested in running some tests to try to pin down
an answer for sure.

I've noticed that also.
