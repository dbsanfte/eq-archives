Well, I don't know if I'm finally breaking the hold on the addiction or what, 
but I decided that since yesterday was a big patch day, I might as well pretend 
that EQ doesn't exist (other than posting in the newsgroup from work).  I got 
together with friends from work, went to a pool hall, and proceded to drink 
heavily.  I actually got positive faction with the girlfriend (you need to stop 
playing that damn game and go out more), and the hangover is less painful than 
the RSI I normally get from clicking Connect 178,342,234,564 times to try and 
get through the congested login servers.  All in all, I think excessive alcohol 
consumption IS a viable alternative to suffering through patch days.  ;)
