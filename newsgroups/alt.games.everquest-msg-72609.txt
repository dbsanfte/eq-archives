Nope.

The general consensus I've gathered from a number of boards and VI
quotes, is this. It's an 8/20 weapon, then on every successful attack,
there is an additional +3 magic damage which could be resisted,
partially resisted, or hit for full. The main thing in question is the
'resistibility' of the racial attributes of the bane weapons which seem
to behave differently from +magic damage weapons
