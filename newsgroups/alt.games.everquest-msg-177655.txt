I have a level 60 druid, a level 50 ranger, a level 30 warrior, and I
just got my troll SK up to 25 and 26 last night in a pickup group in
Marus Seru.

Let me say that it's a dumb idea to run around if you're a caster and
draw aggro.  You will just make it that much harder for any tanks to
regain aggro, and if you're un-SoW'ed and it's unsnared, you'll die
just as fast anyway.

More importantly, if you're a caster in a group and you're getting
aggroed that often, you are doing something wrong.
