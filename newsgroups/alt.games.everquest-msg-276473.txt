Druid tracking is a helluvalot more useful than no tracking at all,
as I can say from playing both ways.  But I agree that rangers win
hands down.

I did once create a ranger just to check whether they had different
level caps or tracking range, and found only three differences between
ranger track and druid track:  (1) Rangers can get it at a lower level.
I forget what level my druid had to get before learning Track, but I
think rangers get it at level 1.  (2) Rangers have a higher class cap.
At low levels, both are limited to skill (5 x Level) + 5, once they can
learn the skill at all.  But druids can never get past 125, whereas
rangers at level 25 and higher can continue to raise the skill to 200
or maybe more.  The level of the skill matters because, as you say, it
determines how far away things can get and still be in your range.
(3) Rangers can sort their list in a lot more ways.  That's the one
that makes rangers win hands down, though the higher maximum range is
important too if you're willing to get to level 39 or wherever your
skill finally caps out.

Exactly.  The maximum range is (10 x Skill) + 50, ignoring the Z axis.
(I ran some tests once. :-)  I think that if a mob or PC is in range when
you open or refresh the Track window, it'll stay on your list for a while
even if it moves out of range, but I'm not entirely sure about that.

I don't recall now, but I think it's alphabetical?  So if you're just
looking for a particular mob you can look it up?  Both that and distance
are really nice compared to the "normal" list sorted by how long it's
been in the zone.  Sure, that does have its uses as well when clearing
placeholders and such, but if I was going to be stuck with just one
form of the list, I think I'd rather have either of the other two as my
"required" choice.

Hehe.  I *have* occasionally had that reaction to the sequence "X is ahead
of you.  X is to the left.  X is behind you."  If it never has a chance to
say "X is ahead and to the left", it often means I did run by very close
to it.  And sometimes I *have* then turned around and found it in my face!

If your druid can't do it from the spires, then neither can a ranger
until at least PC level 25 (skill 130), because the druid's range at
125 isn't any worse than a ranger with skill 125.  On the other hand,
I've had occasion to track things in DL, so I measured the zone and
found my druid could check the whole zone by running east-west twice,
going along about 1/4 of the way away from the north and south walls.
And the druid can get there faster, so that makes up for the extra
running. :-)
