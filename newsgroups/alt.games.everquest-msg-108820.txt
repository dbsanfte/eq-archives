>>>  First, I am not affiliated with the Christian Right, and would
generally call myself liberal. <<<

I would call you someone who has never experienced RPG before EQ. Having
played RPG games in various forms for the last 23 years, I'll see if I can
play devil's advocate.

>>> Now, before you all reach for your Flamers, let me explain. I love
 heroic fable, legend, and fiction with a passion. I believe in the
 phenomenon that JRR Tolkien named Mythopoeica; that we have in our cultures
 and in our selves a memory or longing for the heroic tale, something that
 all of us recognized and respond too when we see it, or hear it, or watch
it
 unfold. But that is not Everquest. <<<

Have you read any of the background on EQ? The battles, the heroes, the
villians, it is actually quite entertaining.

>>>    The best tactic for looting and pillaging these desperate creatures
is
 to torment one of them to run away from the safety of their home, then to
 gang up at about 6 on 1 and slaughter the poor bastard. This way, I can
 advance. <<<

As opposed to them ganging up on me 6 on 1? They did this alot while I was
young in levels, until I learned to either single them out, or find others
who wanted to hunt also and join them.

>>>    Suppose I want money? Well, how about walking through an enter cave
 complex of dog people, butchering the helpless, and gathering in their
loot. <<<

You mean the same dog people that, according to EQ lore, have been
terrorizing the Barbarians and running amok causing havok in the Hills of
Qeynos? Sounds like a crusade for the good people to take up.

 >>> Then I can sell the booty at fair prices, and takes nothing of my skill
or
 daring to acquire. <<<

If it takes no skill or daring, that means that they are too low a level for
you. If you think that the game is designed for you at level 50 to walk
through Blackburrow/Warrens to get money, you need to change your thought
process.

>>>snip tradeskill rant<<<

There are actually people that will pay for certain items. Brewing? Make
Heady Kiolas (I know that's spelled wrong) to sell to other tradeskills. I
see people auctioning jewelry all the time, as well as people advertising to
make Banded and Fine Plate armor.

>>>     Will I stop playing? Probably not, only because I cannot get past
the
 simple wonder of the depth of the virtual world of Norrath. But if only,
our
 victims were really bad, if orcs actually raided Freeport, if the goblins
 attacked Rivervale and I had to rush across Kithicor with dozens of real
 heroes to stop the Pickclaws from taking over the Thicket. If the Deathfist
 orcs had intelligence and tactics beyond losing their tempers. <<<

Again, if the AI was only better, this would not be a problem.

>>>     If I could sell a pot for a decent price. If I could buy ore cheaply
in
 the mountains and sell it for a premium in the Karanas. If bear pelts sold
 for good prices in the desert, because their are no bears there......If
 animals ran when struck with arrows, making hunting with a good bow and
 arrows, and good skills a real accomplishment.. <<<

Online Role Playing games sometimes get frustrating, not because of the
game, but because of who plays it. The majority of the players are probably
like you, and never played an RPG before EQ. Or, they have only played
console RPGs (FF series, for example). It would be nice if every time I got
a skill increase in a tradeskill, I got exp. After all, when I GM I give exp
points for a lot of non-killing actions. But you have to remember the
platform you are playing on ... computer programs can only do so much.

>>>     If only I were king of Verant.....   <<<

Don't we all wish this.
