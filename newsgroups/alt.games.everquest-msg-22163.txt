"New" Befallen? I thought the change to Befallen was only a single-day GM
event thing. Now what's up with the place?

It's kinda stupid if they upped the mobs in the place. It seems like every
place that they increased the exp, they've increased the number and/or level
of the mobs (versus just adding higher exp %). Take Qeynos Catacombs for
instance.

Perhaps I'll be able to find out today, if my card gets here, like it's
*supposed* to. :)
