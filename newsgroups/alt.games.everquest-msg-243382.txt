Can anyone shed light who or what it is I mentioned in subject.

My story goes:
Did some farming in Velk's Lab, finished and we were heading out. The guys 
mumbled something about escorting me out, but as the non intelligent 
warrior of an Ogre I am, I said "just heal me up, I'll go jump off cliff".

For the not-knowing, Velk's Lab got is a several story zone, and from time 
to time you might be so unlucky of falling over the side and hit the floor 
some levels down, due to the icy platforms.

My fellow groupies (Beastlord and Cleric) had done it during the farming in 
accident and all survived with minimum HP loss (50% isnt much is it?!).

Well I had 4.5K HP and was ready for my lemming action. The Beastlord went 
first and survived, I did same thing and found me smashing my head into air 
molecyles and dead. Log said I had been hit by an unknown spell that did 
20K non-melee damage to.

So what was it? SoE support not liking my action?
