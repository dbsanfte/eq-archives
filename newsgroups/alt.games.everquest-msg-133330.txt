Probably not, if I understand the gist correctly.  My problem is, all the
books that I can get are too dumbed down to get as deep as I want.  Sure,
they'll show you the chain rule, and they'll show you how to find a
derivative using it, but they don't prove to you that the chain rule is
true.  I guess I broke my "I believe" button back in Power School.  I'm
actually thinking that the best book for me would be one of those stuffy old
college texts that modern academia shuns for being too "uninspiring."  I
guess that's the difference between studying to maintain NCAA eligiblity,
and studying to learn something.

And there's another potential topic for discussion.... the student's role in
their failure to learn.
