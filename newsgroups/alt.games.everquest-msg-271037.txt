Has Dell added a motherboard-down RAID controller to the 400SC?  Sweet.  Mine do not have
that.

I bought my 3x 400SC as soon as they were released for purchase; I got them for $299 @
after rebates and free shipping.  I ordered them built with 256MB RAM and 1x 20GB drives,
then got additional RAM from Crucial, and the additional disks and controllers from
NewEgg.  My total costs were under $1400 for three RAIDed servers, none with less than a
GB of RAM.  None too shabby methinks  ;->

D'OH the warranty runs out today of all days!  What a coincidence.
