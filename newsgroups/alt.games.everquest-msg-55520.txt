I think one of the reasons Kithicor has a bad reputation at night is
that if you *do* die there, it can be a very annoying death.  You can
get feared and end up with no idea where your corpse is.  Fear casting
mobs do path close enough to get people running on the wall on
occasion, and it is a low visibility zone.  Especially if you are a
race without night vision, it is possible to get ganked even if being
careful...it won't happen often, but once or twice is enough to build
a reputation.
