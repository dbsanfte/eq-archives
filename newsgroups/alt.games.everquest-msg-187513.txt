But the name Megumi, while meaning Goddess, has a connotation more along the
lines of "Charity" when used as a name.  It's simply the derivation.  Now,
were I to name a toon Amaterasu'sama, well that would be a little far out.

Also, add to the fact that Megumi isn't a title by it's Japanese usage, only
by stretching western titular convention.  One would not refer to someone as
"Precia-Megumi."  The proper title in that case would be "Precia-sama."
That's basic Japanese.  Even a first-year student would understand
honorifics, why don't you?
