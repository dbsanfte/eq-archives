> Still no necro spells located yet though,
> so of course, those were the most requested.

For the basic 5 bought ones including the disease based snare. Zone over to
echo caverns from the secret entrance (3rd door on the right with the spire
to nexus on your left facing away from from the shaman, druid beastlord
building). after you zone over and pass 2 guards you will see a left and a
right fork. Take the right fork untill you dead end . That boulder is
actually a door , click it to open and voila the evil settlement associated
with haven . Shadowknight and necro spells , evil race class trainers as
well.

I havent wandered accross the researched necro spells yet but if they exist
I would expect them to be in the coterie castle , or on near the vampyres in
maidens eye or related zones.
