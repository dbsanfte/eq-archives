Depends if you can get all the expansions for cheap. You need
original+kunark+velius+luclin+planes of power if youre serious, so dont
think you can just get by with a couple of expansions.

I think theres still plenty of life in the game yet, ample to get a
character to 65 and make it to VT,elemental planes. My guesss is that unless
sony provide some upgrade path to EQ2, then EQ1 will still be around in 3
years and possibly still retaining more people. A lot of people wont want to
write off 4 years on a character to go to eq2.
