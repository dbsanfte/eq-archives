You only need one level 60 shaman, cleric, enchanter and druid.

The shaman can generate a buttload of long lasting junk
buffs--everything from +CHA to +DR/PR (that one lasts over 3 hours).
Most of the group stat buffs that shamans cast are useless and lasts
for freaking ever.

Cleric will group Aeglo, enchanter to GRM and druid to Circle of
Seasons.

Groug Aegloism and Circle lasts over 3 hours, if you can't get buffed
and ready to go before that poofs, it's time to go practice in
Crushbone.

Regardless the main reason why Vox raids fail is because everyone
ignores the resists.  They always think, oh 150 CR should be enough.
It's not.  The dragon cons red to you, it's AoE will tear through 150
CR in seconds.  And with 150 MR, you'll be running around feared most
of the time.

Absolute minimum for the front line combatants is 220+ CR/MR.  With
mudiflation going in earnest, there should be no problems with getting
220+ CR/MR.  Especially since Circle of Seasons gives +55 and GRM
gives +55.  So basically everyone needs to have about 170 CR/MR
*UNBUFFED*.

Once you get your resists up, Naggy and Vox are nothing more than a
double 255 smacking mobs with 32khps.  Vox just happens to CH alot
(make sure the enchanter chain seive).
