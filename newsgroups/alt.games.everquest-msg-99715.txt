Not a caster, but have you thought about playing a monk?

Yup.

Monks are generally useful--you can tank fairly well at the lower
levels, then your role moves more towards pulling and damage output as
mobs hit harder at higher levels.

Human/Iksar are both medium.

One of the more soloable melee classes (for what it's worth), very
group-friendly.

All monks have a series of guild quests (headbands in Qeynos, sashes
in Freeport, Shackles in Cabilis).  They're a lot of fun.

Just my $0.02...
