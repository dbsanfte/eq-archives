Nope. I have a wood elf druid and didn't max her starting wis (110,
could be 115. I had to reroll her once and before that she had 100
base wis - that never hampered me and is not the reason I restarted).
I am 56 and don't even wear all my wis gear most of the time - it
makes me look ugly (lederhosen, urgh) and the shield I now use has
better AC and resists than my old CGS, so my wis when tradeskilling is
21 points higher than when I am just hunting. Doesn't harm me one bit.

Aside from learning better mana conservation techniques with a
slightly lower pool to depend on, you don't really lose much anyway.
Mana regenerates at a fixed rate, medding the same amount as time will
give you the exact same amount of mana as someone with 50 points more
wis than you, so it will only matter if you're perpetually at full
mana or think you're a wizard.
