Shaved 10 seconds of zoning for every subscriber. 

--------------------------------------------
let's see, no "at least" or "some" but
"10 seconds" for "every" subscriber.

That level of improvement is consistent
with what I'm seeing today playing.  IE
an imperceptible improvement over the 1+
minutes zoning has become in Kunark.

---------------------------------------------

Made it so familiars don't get agroed on. 
Fixed several zone crash bugs 
Changed a paladin spell - a design error in the spell trivialized several 
aspects of the high-end game. 
Fixed several item and content problems. 
Fixed several faction issues - some faction information released with 
Luclin deviated from norm.
