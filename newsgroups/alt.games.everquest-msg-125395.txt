Oh, prolly not then, PvP in MMORPG's rarely works well as the class/race
combo's are never balanced. DAoC was a prime example, with many classes
getting nerfed for being to powerful but those classes still rule RvR. Also,
I was less than impressed by DAoC's encouragement to go the number crunching
way. In it's pre release statements it was declared that stats WOULD make a
difference (they were apparently meant to in EQ, originally, but got watered
down so as to hold back the effects of twinking) but compare a Troll to a
Kobold, the troll race description states that it makes a powerful warrior
the other a weak one, not that they will never deal out or withstand as much
damage as the larger races but their innate agility means they are hit less,
just, they are weak. It was this belief that made me think that my Dark Elf
warrior, in EQ, with his high Agility would get hit much less, oh how niave.

I'll likely take a break from the Genre anyway, finding less and less to do
in EQ these days, far from having done it all just the desire isn't there.
