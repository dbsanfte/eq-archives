Subject: Necro/Shaman Combo?

     I was just wondering what everyone thinks of this combo...... any input
would be great. Dark Elf Necro/Troll Shaman. Would it be possible for the
Shaman to buff the Necro pet enough so that neither (nec/shm) would have to do
any melee? And of course all the other Shaman duties...... Sorry if this is a
newbie question, just curious.
