yep. that was fun flipping back and forth through a dozen pages frantically
looking for Evac.

> - hill giants spawns in east commons

they don't any more? I just thought they got killed as soon as someone
/ooc'd a loc.

> - you couldn't use hotkeys while medding

This sort of made sense, as meditation requires that you not be doing
anything else...

> - you had to click "meditate" to med

That made no sense at all.

> - you had to look at spell book to med (everyone does hah)

This also made no sense at all.

> - low end snakes and spiders were aggro and trained like crazy

That was kind of fun, I wish they'd put that back in.

> - you only had 20 social commands

I never used em anyway.

> - you only had 36 hot keys

Terrible. Now with ten hotkeys per hotkey-page, I need a numerical keypad
with two columns and 5 rows.

> - friends list was same for all chars on all servers

Verant didn't was us getting TOO friendly.

> - Mayong Mistmoor would wipeout zone every 12 hours or whatever

Well, he IS the big fish in the pond.

> - root and snare didn't stack

Who thought up these things?

> - root canceled sow

This tended to really put the kibosh on kiting.

> - jboots would work in dungeons

They still should, in my opinion.

> - jboots DROPPED in najena and were sold on ebay regularly

you had to buy a reservation, to get a ticket, to stand in line, to get into
najena, to camp them.

> - you didn't get a message when spell wore off

Yeah, it was difficult to actually SEE the creeping crud fall off your
victim, as it was to see that stinging swarm dissipate.

> - Every single froggie in Guk was decalred to be part of a "camp"

yelling "camp check" every 10 seconds was fun too.

> - you didn't get a message saying what was looted when in group

I made a lot of plat off this one. I suddenly lost interest in being ML
after they fixed this. At least Rogues should be able to do this.

"You have become better at NinjaLoot! (158)"

> - we would do alpha loot to 5 plat or fine steel

We still do this when starting on a new server.

> - mask of deciever (illusion dark elf) was all/all and dropped

Put it back in!

> - pets would proc sword of runes on anything

Don't remember that one.
