I actually saw some details on this somewhere, let me find it again...
Right, in a response from EQ2 Producer Scott Hartman to some questions
asked by the guy who runs Allakhazam:

http://eq2.allakhazam.com/news/sdetail5482.html?story=5482

The relevant line being:

   I don't have specifics on all of the research that's been done in the
   company, but SOE has done one public poll that I'm aware of, in which a
   majority of active EQ subscribers were asked their opinion on buying and
   selling.
   
   1/3 of the respondents wanted to take part in it, 1/3 of the respondents
   didn't care, and 1/3 didn't like the idea at all. That set the stage for
   there being a significant demand for it from SOE customers.

I'll accept that 1/3 is a "significant demand", which could even warrant
setting up some separate servers to support it.  But I agree with Charles
that Smedley was being a total sleaze by lumping the "don't care" group
in with the "yes" in order to claim a majority supports the idea.  And
even then, 2/3 is not what I consider a "vast" majority.

I still contend that, regardless of how players might respond to any new
SOE polls, unless Station Exchange is a total and obvious fiasco, it will
spread to all of EQ2 within six months, and will hit EQLive with a year.
And more likely both of those guesses are high by a factor of two.
