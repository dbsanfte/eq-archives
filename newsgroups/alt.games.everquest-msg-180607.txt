Well , that's what I meant. How long do you think you can hold 
out playing EQ.

Personally my longest was from 10am to 10am, 24 hours up
without really eating, drank alot of pepsi thought.
But by the time I stopped I was getting a ringing in my ears and my
eyes were aching like crazy and I'm on a 20' monitor.
And before i fell asleep i was still hearing the game..
