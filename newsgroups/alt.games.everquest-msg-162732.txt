Easily :-).  Back in the day when Necro pets were really really powerful,
and waaaaay before pets were made neutral to all mobs (we're talking pre-any
expansions, or maybe just early Kunark release), it was rumored that some
Necs would find an overcon (ie a mob conning blue when it fought on the
level of a light blue or high green) camp spot, summoning a pet, placing him
in the middle of the camp, FDing ,and going to sleep.

The said Necro would then wake up in the morning and be 2 levels higher.
