Well I think this will hurt certain individuals rather than entire guilds...

With very limited mana, you can bet were going to be using our biggest HP
warrior to maintank everything.  That is a massive blow for warriors if were
forced to go with that... if they aren't main tanking (which they do better
than anybody) they offer very little to a raid.
Minimal damage (low damage class + massive AC on luclin mobs) and no other
utilities etc

How can we use the new guild warlord who dinged last week for an uber-mob MA
now, when he would require x amount of extra heals, and now mana is going to
need to be conserved as much as possible.

Smaller guilds (the ones that generally have one high level cleric, 2 at
most online at once)...  they could go for targets like Rhag1, Servitor of
Luclin, maybe Rhag2, the Va'dyn, Insanity Crawler etc..  because those mod
rods probably doubled their healing capabilities.   Thse kind of mobs don't
offer the loot that a full raid force would expect

Modrod 2 isn't a magic button to beating  xxx_mob, using it doesnt guarantee
success by ANY means.. it just takes pressure off guilds healing/cleric
requirements.  Now you will need double the clerics, maybe double the mages
and necros, and whilst VI might "design" the encounter for xx amount of
people,  can't think of a zone where they have EVER coded it well enough to
handle that many people, so that people don't need to constantly look into
the wall/the floor
