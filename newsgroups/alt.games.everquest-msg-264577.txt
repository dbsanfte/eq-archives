When you say 'facilities' does that mean when its on battery power it 
throttles processing power? or does that mean the user *can* throttle 
power back if he wants.

Also, w/ respect to Centrino... the dell site for example lists some 
laptops as P4M 1.6GHz optional Intel CentrinoTM  Mobile Technology.

How exactly is it 'optional'? Is it part of the CPU or not? Is there a 
P4M without Centrino? And which is better? (or which is better for 
what?) And I mean for 'real' not the 'hype'.

I'd like to pick up a new laptop, but the cpu options are baffling. 
Heh... although there is like an 75% chance I'm going to go with an 
Apple Powerbook anyway.
