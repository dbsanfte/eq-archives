"Virtual PC is a powerful software virtualization solution that allows 
you to run multiple PC-based operating systems simultaneously on one 
workstation, providing a safety net to maintain compatibility with 
legacy applications while you migrate to a new operating system. It also 
saves reconfiguration time, so your support, development, and training 
staff can work more efficiently. Microsoft released Microsoft Virtual PC 
2004 on December 2, 2003."

Virtual PC Homepage, Paragraph One.

That's just one cite, but countless press releases, pundits, news 
articles, and analysts all concur.
