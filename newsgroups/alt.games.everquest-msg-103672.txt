Rathe Mountains are good for druids...I agree with Overthere except i don't
think the experience is all that good...If you were careful you could take a
brutes or burynai in Frontier Mountains...But yes, Dalnir drops monk
equipment and Unrest drops paladin cleric items...is there a zone that drops
druid items?  What are druid items? LOL
