I like it.  I was confused at first when I logged into the bazaar.
But, I just pulled up /baz, searched for a common item and hit "Find
Trader."  The trail led me to the teleport thingy and then, studying

Not sure what to say about your performance issues.  I have a much
lesser machine and didn't notice any problems.
