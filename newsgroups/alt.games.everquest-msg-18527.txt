Be very careful here. I as a 49 warrior was aggroed by everything here. i
laid waste to everything in sight on the 1st floor. I camped the SK for a
while but no show. As of now, im unaware of what and who drops the keys for
Befallen..if they drop even at all. Things have a crazy respawn time and
almost everything will backstab you if you turn your back. Almost all the
pets do that, and some pets even cast on you. I jumped down the well to see
what was down htr. I was immediatley swamped wityh 2 necros, 2large pets, a
reanimated sacrifice, and a Gurd of Layns. I killed each, but with them all
hitting me i was actualy worn doiwn to 1 and a half bubbles. More things
added and the agrrpo range is large. I just would be cautions. The third
floor also has a level 11 named mob that when hailed it describes her as
being shackled to the floor. Anyway, she has Uber HP. Insane, insane insane.
I swear its over a million HP. It took a ful group of a 49 rogue, 49
warrior, 52 monk, 45 monk, ans a chanter fighting it. Also has the
additional help of a 52 wizard a bard and another monk. We started killing
her when she was at half health. It took over an hour to kill her.She doesnt
hit back and just lets you beat on her. She is highly highly highly MR and
the only spell the wizard got off was a 44 or 49 wizard spell, not sure
whoch..but it hit for 720 a pop and didnt even dent her. She drops  gossimer
robe btw  lol. I dont think she is supposed to be killed, anyhow she
respawned withing 1 minute of her death. It was interesteing. Goodluck
there.
