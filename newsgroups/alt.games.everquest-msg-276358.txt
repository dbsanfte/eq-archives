Today's London "Observer" has an article titled "They play games for
10 hours - and earn ï¿½2.80 in a 'virtual sweatshop' ", about companies
such as www.gamersloot.net who hire people in Romania (where the
average work wage is lower than in other countries like the U.K.) to
play different computer games so the companies can then sell stuff
such as plat and "powerleveling" services.  (EQ is mentioned briefly)
