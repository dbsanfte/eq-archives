I've taken care of ZoneAlarm.

BTW, lame ad hominem.  Try harder.

I'm not using ZA Pro.  Most people here probably use the freely

Sounds like a good recipe for disaster.  Virus writers could take
advantage of the fact that users have disabled ZA's defenses in such
fashion.  There are a lot of EQ users out there that would make
juicy targets if your "advise" was taken by too many people.

Stupid idea, Mr. Jekke.  Maybe you shouldn't teach people how to help
their computers become virus havens.
