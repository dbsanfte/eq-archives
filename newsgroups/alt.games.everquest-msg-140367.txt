More Selfish than that, just that *I* will no longer have to use the Scions.

Still in two minds on whether I like the idea. On the one hand I like the
idea that I no longer have to wait for a Scion to get to Luclin on the other
I think it cheapens the RPG side of things as this massive change in the
game has been done without explaination or storyline. Why not a quest for
the Stormhammer players? The "uber" Druids and Wizards could quest to be the
first to discover the spells and then have them named after them. Ok, maybe
not, given the naming policy I think I'd rather have no explaination than a
group of spells called "Oobahnuker's <zone name> Portal"

CF
absolutely love the idea that I can now port to the other side of the moon
and not negotiate some visually laggy or dangerous (or laggy and dangerous)
zones on route.
