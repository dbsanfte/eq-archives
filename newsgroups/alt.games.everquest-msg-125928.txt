I play on a Compaq 1.4ghz with a 32 meg S3 video card.  I just turn all the
new models off and it works fine.  What you need to realize tho is that
laptops will never be in the same ballpark as desktops as far as video
performance.  You WILL notice a difference. Just the price you pay for
mobility.
I also have EQ on a 533 HP laptop with a 4 meg S3 video card, and it runs
(with all the models off, haven't tried Luclin on it).  Basically I stick
with the desktop, but the laptops are nice for those weekends away from home
when I still need my EQ fix.
