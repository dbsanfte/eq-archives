Well just have 2 comments here

1.  Sounds like you've been hunting with one of our Monks - they think
nothing of bringing a bucket load of mobs & falling down leaving the
poor chanter (me) to sort it out!  WoM, mez, root, Arcane Rune & jobs
a good un.  I never mess with AE mezzes - I know things move on but
died so many times in sol b cos I mezzed my self that I never trusted
them again!!

2. Ah happy days of AE'ing FG!!  We used to have the maddest puller
ever - a wizzy called Emery.  His idea of breaking me in gently was
'just' to pull 27 on my first ever group there!!
