I got mine about a week ago...Someone told me about the quest while I was in
Qeynos so I got the joker card after about 8pp or so and ported to WC.  Off
to High Pass and got to his spawn.  Taa Daa,  Dyllin standing right there.
Now here's the tricky part.  Is a couple shouts asking if anyone is camping
him enough?  I sat there for about 15 min getting the timing of the Red guy
down pat as well...Not a soul to be seen.  Shouted twice more before the
kill.   Lets say he died a quick death.  Conned light blue for a 23 druid.
I was in and out in about 20 mins.  Had my ToV in less than 1 hour after
learning of the quest.  This is the first time I've takin down a rare spawn
that had to be camped.  Does someone camping have to sit right there and
wait or can they sorta call dibs and go hunt in the zone and just respond to
any shouts that the spawn is camped.  I would think sitting, waiting is the
proper way.   Anyways thought I'd share that.
