Must not play many scrappers, controllers, etc. All the time, I have
some punk ass blaster sniping mobs out from under my nose just as I'm
starting in on them. Or picking off from the pack I'm fighting. yes,
that IS KSing. If I'm engaged in combat with them (even if I'm not
attacking that specific mob at the time) and someone else comes along
and blasts it, they're stealing my kill.

No, one of my few big gripes about CoH is the devs' position of
"there's no such thing as Killstealing in CoH". It's naive and
short-sighted.
