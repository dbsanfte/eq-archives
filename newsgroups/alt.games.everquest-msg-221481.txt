I play a 56 Enchanter and almost never cast Rune IV or V (which
use a peridot) on anyone but myself.  I rarely cast it on myself.  If
I'm in a situation where I might take a lot of quick agro (lots of
mezzing needed) I'll put up Rune to give me a couple extra seconds
to land a slow/mez.  In Raids I'll usually take along Rune V so I can
stick the MT if the healers are having trouble, but that's a rarity in
most of my situations.
For casual damage absorb I use Rune III which uses a Jasper.

As an enchanter I never ask for reimbursement because the casts
are almost strictly on myself.  If someone else wanted a rune
cast and they weren't going to donate a peridot I'll hit them with
Rune III.  (As with everything, there are exceptions to the rule)

I also have a 51 Cleric who is VERY happy to get reimbursed for
my peridot use which has been as low as 2 and as high as 10!  At
51 ten peridots is 105 pp, the plat gained from an LDoN is
probably around 80 - 110 pp.  If I get back plat for the peridots
spent to save the others, the split now becomes 60-90 which is
a small price to throw towards a nice cleric.

ps. While I might ask for reimbursement for peridots, asking for
30% split out-right seems ridiculous.
