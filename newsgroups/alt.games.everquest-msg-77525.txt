 I'd wait until you're higher. Explore the areas around Cabilis. There's
really no reason to leave before 20 in my opinion. I'd even wait until
level 30 or so when you already have most of your skills. Unless you do
a lot (a lot) of faction work you wont find a Monk trainer anywhere else
that wont want to kill you. Unless you can find Brother Zephyl up in
Rathe Mts. In addition to a quest guy he's also a trainer. I'm assuming
Brother Qwinn in SK is as well but good luck finding him.
