There're a couple details I forgot to mention in my earlier post.
Although basic proc frequency is unaffected by weapon delay, and
thus unaffected by haste and slow, there are two situations where
weapon delay is significant.

The first is when "jousting", a style of PvP combat where you use
a high damage weapon and attempt to rapidly engage/disengage with
your opponent, making weapon delay irrelevant (your first attack
with a weapon is immediate, weapon delay only effects subsequent
attacks).  In this situation you can actually increase your proc
chance by being _slowed_ (chance per swing is modified by current
weapon delay).  Counter-intuitive, but I've heard of people doing
it.

The second is when you have more than one possible proc that can
fire on a given attack.  Because the number of procs vs. time is
constant (subject to random distribution), and additional procs
apparently are not checked if one earlier in the list fires, and
additional procs do not have their chance per swing adjusted to
compensate for the "lost" chances when an earlier proc fires, a
low delay weapon will get more secondary procs because the lost
chances to proc are a smaller fraction of the total number of
attacks you get in a given timespan (speaking of procs from
augments and combat innates here, just to be clear).

And that's probably way more than most of you wanted to know.
