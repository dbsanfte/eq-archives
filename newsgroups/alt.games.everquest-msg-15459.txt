Couldn't the name just be pulled from  the chatrooms? The couple of times I
was in the chatroom it used my Station logon, as my username there.
Is there a way to change that ?

I've also seen mentioned that there are "utilities" susptected of being
password stealers, but I've not seen any specific programs mentioned. How
likely is it that one of the utilities floating around are grabbing PW's ?
