   I did Customer Service for a few years for a newspaper in a large city. 
Basically, telling people that we would replace their missing paper, or
explaining why they have to pay their bill to continue getting delivery. 
Pretty basic stuff.  I've been told I have a very professional, pleasant
sounding phone voice when I am working.  I was pretty well trained.  And
even so, I got heaps of abuse over a 35 cent newspaper.  Even at $10 an
hour, I felt like I was being put through a wringer.

   I can't imagine why anyone would do a CSR for such a complex game as EQ,
dealing with overly emotional kids and experience junkies, for free (well,
for the price of a subscription).  At least, not doing it for long.
