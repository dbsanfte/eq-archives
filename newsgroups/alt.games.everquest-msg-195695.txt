    Zone in, don't do a /who, run to The Pit to see what's camped. There
wouldn't be anything in /shout or /ooc to indicate RZ is being done, what
with channels and all. I know you and I do /who as a matter of reflex to see
what raid mobs might be open, but not everyone is like that. Especially
people that got into Tactics on one of the open Behemoth raids (we've had a
few successful ones on my server).
