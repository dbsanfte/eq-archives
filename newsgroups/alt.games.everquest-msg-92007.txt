  I don't think it's particularly "greedy."  The way I figure it, if they're
going to do this Legends thing, they might as well do it right, and make sure
they invest enough resources in it to maintain the dynamics of the world,
provide the excellent customer service people are going to expect, and to have
the ability to add other bells and whistles that people will enjoy, and make
sure they continue to work.

  I don't know what kind of profit they're making from each Legends subscriber
compared to everyone else, but it's probably going to be a balancing act for
them between trying to pull profit from the project, and making sure they can
retain interest in the service by offering a level of service that people will
pay for... afterall, if people decide that ultimately it isn't worth paying for,
they can just drop back down to a regular subscription without having to
completely quit the game, give up their character and accomplishments, ect.
