I have no problems getting single pulls with my 53 Monk in PoI. Proximity
aggro works wonders. Take for instance the first pair of two just to the
left right next to GY. Get on far side of the mob closest to you and inch up
slowly till it aggros and the second one never comes. This zone is really
nice because theres a lot of statics and minimal amount of roamers, so you
can FD split pretty easy. Pulling in PoD thats another can of worms....
everything there roams and if I FD split I just get more and more and more
mobs till I have to /quit out. Very lame.
