   I was hoping that SOE wouldn't do this.  They seem to be aware that they
have a public relations problem with at least a large part of their EQL
customer base (or maybe they think the summit fixed all that, I dunno).  I
was crossing my fingers that maybe they would make at least a token effort
to show in EQII that they really do care about player's enjoyment of the
game more than squeezing every last possible cent out that they can.  I was
disappointed when they sold beta slots, and now I'm disappointed that they
are selling character slots.  

    Don't get me wrong.  I think they are a business, and have every right
to make a profit.  Heck, even a healthy profit.  I had no problems with
them when they raised the monthly rate in EQL.  But I, like many others,
grew impatient with the "cut Customer Service and don't worry about fixing
bugs in the game while we churn out uninspired expansions that we can make
as much money as is possible" attitude that seemed to be the driving force
in SOE.  

    Well, they certainly have the right to operate that way.  Just like I
have a right to walk away.
