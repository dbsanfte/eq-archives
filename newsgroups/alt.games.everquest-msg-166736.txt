Just discovered GBS when doing a search for "Wild Rover." I guess Mari Mac
is more or less their signature tune. I've heard they go nuts when they
perform it live. I also enjoyed their versions of Drunken Sailor and Donkey
Riding.

If you like that kind of music your would probably like Wylde Nept. They
recorded probably the most entertaining ever versions of Finnegan's Wake and
Whiskey in the Jar. Their original song "Bewitchin' Brenda" is one of my
wife's favorites. We saw them live at a Celtic Festival and were very
impressed.

Yes, I know this is off-topic.
