SO ANYWAY, in another thread I recounted our adventures in
froggy-land (No, not France, Lower Guk!). But wait, there's
more! Before that, me and some other friends went to Crystal
Caverns, while the rest of my regular group were busy with
guild raids and stuff like that.

So, these are another set of friends, a bard, enchanter,
warrior, and cleric, all in their low 30s. They've been
telling me how great exp has been for them in CC, so I
decide to join them in there. So we range from 30 to 37,
me the highest one. So I start a lot of my sentences with
so.

Friday: With me in the group, they decide that we should
be able to hold the bottom of the ry'gorr mine. So we do.
And we rock the place. And rare drops rain down on us.
And the exp rolls in. I'm telling you, if you like dungeons,
and can bring your own group, and are in your low 30s, you
will fall in love with that place. Non-stop action, AND you
get rich! Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Overthere!

We get 2 BCRs, a CCS for each member, a cloak for each
member, 2 Foreman's Skull caps, a belt, and so many herba
packs that we lose count. The enchanter, who was lowest,
gets 32. I get 38. In TWO HOURS, the cleric gets a third of
the way through 35. Everyone is loaded with velium weapons,
gems, plat, what have you. We fall over when we vendor the
Frozen long swords, and get almost 24pp for each one.

Saturday: The enchanter can't make it, so we're a bit
worried whether the bard'll be able to hold the pit
today. We try anyway. After a shaky start ( I had bard
songs off, so didn't notice the mezzes, which the bard
didn't always call), we succeed gloriously. We rock the
place so hard, we intentionally train ourselves, the cleric
targeting and wrathing a high-up orc, bringing 6-7 orcs
at a time. I get the third BCR, the others get more of
the shrouds and the cloaks, having auctioned off theirs,
and the warrior gets another BCR too, making that a total
of 4 so far. The cleric leaves 35, and I ding 39.

Take note, PLers in Overthere: That cleric used maybe
5-6 hours to get through 35, and he got filthy rich doing
it too! Dungeons, it's not just for breakfast anymore...

Sunday: Giddy with excitement, intoxicated by our own
success, full of hubris, we leave for LGuk. I direct
your attention to the Famous Last Words thread...

BUT!

Monday: I go to EC, sell off my ill-gotten gains, and
with the 2.5k procured, purchase a lammy. Fear me!
And! The cleric swaps an EE bag and 400pp for a copy
of Celestial Healing! Not a shabby deal! And also!
The Other Cleric, the one in my Regular Group, lucks
out on an auction, buys a crystal chitin shield for
150pp, which is completely insane!

Oooh, questions!

I'd like to take this group to the Tower soon, how
far do you guys think we can aim our sights? The
reason I ask is, two of my Regular Group guys were
on a guild raid in ToFS, and they came out loaded
with nice lewts.

Ooh! Another Velious-related question! What level
would you say would be needed to do a little keeling
in Icewell Keep? That Frosted shit don't sound half
bad! Hope I can convince the others that Thurgadin
is for losers...

The Other Group has all gotten SoL now, any pointers
for good Amazon Women^W^W late-30s dungeons On The Moon!?

Why why why, when you know you want 2.5k for your Lammy,
do you insist on saying "how much will you give for it",
when YOU'RE the one who's auctioning it? Are you just
hoping for some moron to come along and say "I'll pay
5k for that lammy!", or what?

Rune, 0pp in the bank again, doh! 1 blue from 40, though!
