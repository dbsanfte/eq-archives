I'm not sure if they're talking about all European customers or only those
wishing to participate in a localised (i.e. French/German/etc) beta. I'd
guess they do mean that European customers aren't allowed in the beta, but
are avoiding saying it outright due to being marketing people (thus having
a natural aversion to saying what they mean), but it's by no means clear.
