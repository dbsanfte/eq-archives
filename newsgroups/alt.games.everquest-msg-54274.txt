Yeah, and as a bard, I'm quite aware of the long history of musicians
being known by a single moniker.  I really, really wanted to just have
a Glyph, and the GM got a kick out of it, but only letters and
apostrophes are allowed.  Also, one of the bards from Fires of Heaven
or another of the really, really uber-guilds has Lorespinner as a
surname, and it's bothered me ever since I saw the screenshot.  I
certainly don't want to be thought of as a wannabe.
I'm tempted to just go around in Iksar form all the time and follow
our Iksar naming convention and become Arolpin Arolpin, but it doesn't
the same ring as Squat Squat or Saric Saric.

Arolpin
57 bard
