I am bummed about this myself.  I was hoping that the focus item(s)
that
reduce casting time would work for bards too.  Their casting time is
about
3 seconds, and a shorter time would enable us to twist more songs
simultaneously, or at least make it a little easier to twist the songs
we currently twist, esp. in the presence of lag or lots of other
activity
going on.

I hope they figure out a way to relax the nerf a bit.
