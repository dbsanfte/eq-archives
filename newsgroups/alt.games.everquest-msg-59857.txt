*Almost* as frustrating is the immovable pet. Had this problem outside the
bank in Thurgadin. Cast pet. Start running to the mines. Turn around to
check pet (a habit all pet classes develop), no pet. Back to the bank, no
Jobober. Check inside bank. Apparently Jobober decided he needed to make a
deposit. Try moving this way, that way, anyway to get Jobober to follow. No
luck. Jobober has found a circular path and will not deviate. /rude Jobober;
/cast reclaim Jobober.

BTW this was before I got the summon companion spell.
