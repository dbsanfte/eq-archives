Well, Eq just had a faction issue fixed with the last patch. You know the
Reporting of faction coming out wrong;
Your faction with Orc got worse
Your faction with Orc got better
Your faction with Orc got better

They said it was a visual thing only, that the messages were bugged. Not the
actual accumulation of faction. But who knows.

Not saying this is the problem, but might be involved.
