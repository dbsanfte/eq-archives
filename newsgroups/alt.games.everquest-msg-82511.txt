I fail to see why anyone would be interested in what level Verant thinks
that you "should" be to use something.
ONly if they plan to nerf it (make it unusable for lower levels) in a later
patch. I fail to see the relevance of that tag and I understand if people
get confused.  Maybe if some of the items have less effects because of the
level of the guy who uses it, but not with a gate potion.
