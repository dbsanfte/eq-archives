The Seamist sprites and fairies start off non-aggro, but will go KOS if you kill
a few of them. If you've killed just one, you should be ok still.
You're free to kill mischevious maidens and the sirens, they don't share faction
with the Seamists.
In Zek, you'll probably want to avoid killing Greenhoods. Not sure about
Rivervale.
