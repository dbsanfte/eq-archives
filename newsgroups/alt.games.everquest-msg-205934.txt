Yes definately.  There are as many players currently as there ever were
(read: subscribed accounts)

Necro, Druid, Wizard, Bst, Mage (in that order too, although thats open to
debate)

Havent looked into EQ2 much..

It

Quading = bunching 3-4 monsters together, and casting 1 spell that hits
multiple targets (there are various spell types, single target, area effect,
and waves that land on 4 targets)
Kiting is having a monster chase you, while you are casting damage spells on
him - rather than be actively engaged in melee with the mob.
Twinking is giving (or getting) high level items or gear
Bling... an ebay reference - something/somebody that makes R/L money

Depends.. did you buy the UBISOST New Dawn version?  I believe this is
Europe only.
Its easy to tell though, do you see 3 or  a huge list of server names to
pick from?

> 6) I have all the expansion packs, but no idea how to use them?

Once installed you don't have to do anything. They are land addons and spell
addons etc, that seamingly integrate with everything else.

Whichever you fancy. Ask questions, read websites, or experiment.

There is a /loc command, which gives your current location (a series of 3
numbers) - each time you move these numbers obviously change.
There is also a compass, and something called "sense heading"

Invisible zone lines.  Sometimes doors, sometimes portals you click on,
sometimes just an invisible line in the middle of the snow/sand etc

Nothing wrong or right about it.  Each has pros and cons.

> 11) Is magic and spell casting complex?

No.

This is a server specific question, and everybody has a different opinion on
what makes a guild "worth joining".

1 final thing to say is no 1 person is right in what they say. A lot of it
is opinion.. so put the various responses together for a better picture.
