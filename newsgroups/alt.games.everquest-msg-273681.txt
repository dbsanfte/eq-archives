They may be referring to the fact that while WoW *does* have tradeskills, 
they are merely a formality. There is very little to them. For all intents 
and purposes, they level right along with your adventure level with just a 
modicum of effort.

It's really kind of silly *not* to do tradeskills in WoW as they offer 
great benefits for very little investment in terms of time and effort.
