Listen son, Don't presume to call me son......I'm a 39 year old one-eyed
veteran.

It appears that we've confused "suicide" as an escape from life and it's
inconveniences, with the act of sacrificing ones life for a firmly held
belief. One is cowardly, the other is absolutely not.
 Cowardice is defined as showing "ignoble fear in the face of danger or
pain"
It's a good word when used correctly, however it simply does not apply in
this case.



A word history, blatantly stolen from www.dictionary.com:

Word History: A coward is one who "turns tail." The word comes from Old
French couart, coart, "coward," and is related to Italian codardo, "coward."
Couart is formed from coe, a northern French dialectal variant of cue,
 "tail" (from Latin cda), to which the derogatory suffix -ard was added.
This suffix appears in bastard, laggard, and sluggard, to name a few. A
coward may also be one with his tail between his legs. In heraldry a lion
couard, "cowardly lion," was depicted with his tail between his legs. So a
coward may be one with his tail hidden between his legs or one who turns
tail and runs like a rabbit, with his tail showing.

I find the acts committed by these murderers and terrorists to be
reprehensible, and beyond any rationale. Please don't misunderstand ny point
of view here. I'm on the side of reason, life, and the proper usage of
words.....
