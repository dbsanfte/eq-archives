Blimey.  That's some comprehensive advice.  Thank you for taking the time to
give me all that.

Once thing did strike me as odd, though.  Since one of the major meanings of
"rogue" would be solitary or independent, one who does not "go with the
crowd", as it were - isn't it bizarre that our beloved Verant would make it
such a difficult class for soloing?  Ho-hum...  A new mystery every day, eh?

:o)

Thanks again.
