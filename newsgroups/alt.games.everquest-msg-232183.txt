Any race that can be in an "evil" classes (Necro and SK definitely)
could walk into the outpost _provided_ they do not worship a "good"
god in other word, are agnostic. My human enchanter is agnostic and
/cons apprehensive. If I'd known about faction, my erudite mage would
have been agnostic rather than a Quellious worshipper (so is KOS) and
might have been able to enter the outpost. Don't know if any other
"evil" gods get KOS to VS faction which is the faction of the entire
outpost.

Always /con one of the inhabitants, the gate gollem is good, and if
you aren't KOS to it, you aren't KOS to the others inside, not even
the Dragoons.

Halflings, elves (all kinds), barbarians?, and dwarves would be KOS
because of their race. They can't be necros or sks. Baring extensive
faction work, I guess and I don't know if enough faction work could be
done to not be KOS, they'd be KOS to everyone in the outpost.

The one faction quest available -- turning in Sarnak warbraids (wpn)
-- is basically almost impossible if you are KOS because you'd have to
get inside the outpost to turn in the warbraids to someone you are KOS
to. Illusions don't work well enough, sneak and such might, but one
slip and they are all after you.

One ploy me and my friends try is to get close to the outpost wall
near where the turn-in is going to happen and have a group memeber
(who is not KOS) do the turn in. I know we get xp from it, but don't
see faction messages, so we probably are not getting faction.
