I don't know what she meant by her brain just going wild.

But to quote a Beatles tune, "All You Need is Love," "Nothing you can know
that isn't known."

There's nothing you can know that isn't known...by SOMEONE.  *I*, for one,
did not know that amazon.com provides such clearing services for charities.
I still don't KNOW...I'm taking your word for it. :)
