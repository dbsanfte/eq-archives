BRAVO. I couldn't agree more in your general statement. However, I do
believe that there are two types of swearing. The occassional "F*ck, I
just got killed" and the blatant cussing for entertainment purposes.
Although by no means are those in the first group excused from there
use of "obscene" language, it is a bit easier to tolerate then the
other.
