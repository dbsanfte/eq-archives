Hiyas,

Me again. Just postin' about EQ Hacker's Realm. You can get EQW to play 
EQ in a window, you can get TuxTrainer (free EverQuest trainer), guides 
and a whole crapload of stuff found almost nowhere else. One difference, 
this website is free, and it isn't a bunch of stupid spam crap ;). Well 
good luck.

For those of you who plan on flaming me for blocking Internet Explorer 
with pop-up windows: *yawn*

For those of you who falsly accuse things of having a virus there or 
something stupid like that: check it yourself cmon man :p

For those of you who enjoy the site and all the hardwork: *yay!*
