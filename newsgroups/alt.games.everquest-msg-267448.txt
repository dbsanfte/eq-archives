I love watching your overreactions regarding this subject.  You should
get your blood pressure checked.

Needless to say, I think he's right.  I don't think he was pretending
to be a prophet, he's just expressing his viewpoint.  So did you, but
of course, like an asshole, as usual.

You should learn to STFU more often.  Just a few months back you were
essentially calling people who didn't play EQ anymore but still
participated in a.g.e assholes for doing it.  I'm shocked the many
a.g.e regulars who no longer play EQ let that slide.  They seem to
give you far more slack than you deserve.
