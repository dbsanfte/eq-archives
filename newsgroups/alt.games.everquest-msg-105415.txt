Wasn't there already a whole thing written up about how EQ deals with haste
internally?  In an article (which I am kicking myself for not bookmarking),
it was established that haste doesn't actually increase attack speed nor
decrease delay, but simply increases the damage done over a given period of
time.

Does anyone have that link to that article and can they post it here again?

All the formulas are nifty, but I don't think EQ modifies attack speed at
all when applying haste modifiers.

Of course, I might have just imagined the article I read...I tend to be
sleep-deprived and I get drowsy a lot during the day.
