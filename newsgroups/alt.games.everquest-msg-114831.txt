Re: Erud's Crossing

Yes, that is the spell. It has a great damage/mana ratio when fighting
elementals.

Erud's Crossing is located between Antonica and Odus. From the Kaladim
area the quickest route is to take the Nexus spires in Greater Fey to
the Nexus (you need the Luclin expansion for this), and then the *Odus
Teleport pad down to Toxxilia Forest. You then run North to the city
of Erudin, and take the boat to Erud's Crossing. The only trick is
that the boat from Erudin to Erud's Crossing doesn't stop at the
island. You have to take it one more zone to Qeynos, and then stay on
the boat for the return trip. The trip is completely safe. The worst
thing you might run into is a level 6-8 skeleton in Toxxilia.

Boat Route
South Qeynos-->"Wisp" Island in Erud's Crossing-->City of Erudin
City of Erudin --> South Qeynos (passing through Erud's Crossing, but
not stopping at the island)

I would recommend binding at the docks in South Qeynos. The boats are
on a 10-15minute timer, so if things go wrong and you die, you won't
have to wait very long for the next boat.

Head over to www.eqatlas.com and look up the zones I mentioned. It is
not as complicated as it sounds. Be VERY careful when using the Odus
Teleport pad in the Nexus. The same pad is used to port down to Great
Divide in Velious. GD is a 30+ zone, and you do not want to go there
by mistake. Pay attention to the announcements in the Nexus to make
sure you time it right. The Nexus ports are 15 minutes apart, so you
have plenty of time to figure out when to get on the pad.

Everyone is a "rank newbie" once. Cherish the joy of discovery now. It
won't be long before you are just another jaded player like the rest
of us :-).
