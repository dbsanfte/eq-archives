And 80% of the clarity beggars are druids, which is why I so much love
to hear druids whine about sow beggars. Most are nice enough about it
though. Although a good portion will run off without saying a thing or
recriprocating.

I remember one time chugging across S Karana , get a tell,

"can I plz have clarity"

My response, "Sure come find me, I am just North of paw chugging my way
to the bridge",

"brt"

About 15 seconds later a wolf pulls up, I hit it with clarity, and I get:

"thx"

And the druid zooms off, and I am standing there thinking about
injustices, I send him a tell,

"ahh could I get a SoW?"

No response......

Well it could be that he did not connect the two events, and I may have
seemed like another sow beggar, oh well, I continue slogging my way
across the zone.
