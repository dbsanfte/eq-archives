There must be something about NRo and players of that ilk.  I took my noob
(12) warrior there when I got tired fo LFG with my cleric. Hooked up with a
dr00d (whose name is a phoenetic spelling of a familiar fantasy character)
and a wizard. The dr00d was the only healer (obviously) and I was the puller
(obviously). So, we're at derv 1, as derv 2 was camped by a 30+ caster, and
the dr00d buffed himself then pulled the entire camp (sans Dorn thankfully).
as soon as we got done with that (luckily no one died) derv 2 opened and we
moved.

well, the dr00d pulls another from derv 1 after we decided to move, so I had
to run back (I also had to ask for SoW...) kill the derv then we all move to
2.

anyway, I had to repeatedly ask for healing (got below 1 bubble of health
several times), I had to ask for buffs, and had to remind him that pulling
was my job.  plus, we only had 3 people and he had a fit when I got more for
the group.

/sigh

The funniest part was, he told me to chill when I explained the different
roles to him.
