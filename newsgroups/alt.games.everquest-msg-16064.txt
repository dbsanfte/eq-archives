Hi

Just wondered if this had happened to anyone else in SK?

Killed one of the named Centaur's in SK, Jarhn Meadowgreen or something,
Body disappeared and no exp, even though it conned blue?  This was a couple
of weeks ago when I was hunting in this area, thought nothing of it...never
had any probs with the game before, kinda shrugged and thought "ah well,
something was bound to not work sometime" and carried on my travels  : )

Last night I was running through SK, heading towards Rathe Mountains, via
Lake Rathetear, when I noticed on my tracking that Krak Windchaser (avaik
chief type blokey)  was still blue to me, yummy thought I, will go chop him
up : )   ...........did so, and the body disappeared and no exp?  again?
weird???

Strange huh
