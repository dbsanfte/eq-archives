It is called Disulfiram (Trade name: Antabuse)

I do agree with this sentiment, to some degree.  I went to france a while 
back, and noticed that there were many fewer guard rails on things and big 
signs saying "CAUTION" or what have you.  It was refreshing not having to 
be told not to jump off a perfectly obvious 30 foot precipice.  So I 
wonder if excessive concern with labelling dangerous things is an American 
preoccupation.
