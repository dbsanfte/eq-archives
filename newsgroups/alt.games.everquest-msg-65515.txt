Any Ideas?

Does anyone have SOL working with ME.


I crash to desktop when I try to log on with the Vah Shir.  I also DO
NOT get the new skins for characters.  My OS is ME

I have not corrected the problem with the original install but I
installed EQ on the same PC but with 98 instead of ME.   That worked.
This was not a downgrade but a completely different Install.  So
basically I have an old Video card driver and no recent 98 patches.  I
am guessing it could be anything from IE 5.5 with SP2 to any of the
patches that I have done with the ME machine.  I am almost sure it has
something to do with what I mentioned because I have two machines with
ME but with different equipment.  The common factors are ME,  IE 5.5
with SP2 and patches.
