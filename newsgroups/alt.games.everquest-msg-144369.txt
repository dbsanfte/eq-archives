So do you really think he would buy it from you for 20k knowing you got it
for 300?  That does not seem realistic *at all*.  If it were me I think I
would hang at the bazaar for a few days at least to see if I could find
another good price.  Things have come down quite a bit since the bazaar
opened and though 300 may not be realistic (but you never know) I would not
be surprised to see that your 20k 'good deal' turned out to be overpriced.
OTOH, if he is willing to pay $100k I wouldn't fault you for taking it.  I
just think you telling him it is a good deal might be not as close to the
truth as you would like to believe.
