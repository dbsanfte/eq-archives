I was aware of the 3 second cast time.  And with their near point blank 
range, I wouldn't be pulling with them either, if I'm that close I can 
just whack the mob with a weapon.

12 points of nuke damage for 3 seconds wasted, I won't be using them for 
DPS either.

BUT if they interrupted casting, then there was a chance I'd end up 
using them a lot, when fighting mobs that CHeal or gate.  I can give up 
3 seconds of DPS if it means an interrupt of something that important, 
after all, SK DPS really isn't all that good at level 60 and  no AA, and 
Velious era gear (Kunark era really, its Velious out but I don't have 
much from there yet)

I've yet to see a conclusive post saying they don't interrupt casting, 
from someone who tried the experiment.  Nor have I myself tried it, 
despite having the things now for a day and a half; only caster mobs 
I've fought since then was in a group, with 4 of us trying 
simultaneously to interrupt the casts and succeding.  I tried the 
shackles a couple times, but no way of knowing whether it was them that 
did the interrupting!

And if I'm MT, with a 3 second cast time, good chance I'm getting 
interrupted before they go off.

I think its likely, very likely, that they don't interrupt, by the way, 
I'm just looking for confirmation.

Whats a nice easy to get to mob which Cheals, but is soloable at 60?
