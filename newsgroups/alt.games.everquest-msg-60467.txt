Ah ok, my friend tried it and it does indeed work as well on a tnt 16
meg with 128 meg ram as running it full screen. Frankly I was amazed.
I guess it was dx windows that my friend tried and got low frame rate.
I was thinking they were the same thing.

One very irritating thing though is that the person won't let you
enter the site with IE, which my friend prefers. my friend had to
install crappy opera then delete it just for this for no good reason
except the person seems to be on some crusade against IE. I open up
PNG files in IE fine but evidently they can't be "alpha blended" which
I could give a rats ass about.
