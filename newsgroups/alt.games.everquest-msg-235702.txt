Just have completed my second week playing eq and I'm thoroughly enjoying
it. None to surprisingly I have a few questions that I thought someone could
help me with:

Firstly, as a cleric should I be automatically healing/buffing any players I
come across. I'm not sure what accepted practice is. A few players have
helped me out over the past couple of weeks which I have appreciated, but as
a new player I have panicked a few times when my character is suddenly
surrounded by flashing lights without any warning!

At some point I am assuming I will need to group to advance. As a new player
what is the best way to do this? I have noticed a few threads that complain
about poor players on this ng and obviously I will be, initially, more of a
burden than a help I suspect.

How long would I be expected to commit to a group? I generally play for 3-4
hours on an evening. Obviously I would not want to disappear leaving the
group without a member all of a sudden. Is there usually an agreed playing
time or goal that is set?

Thanks for any help or pointers that you can provide.

Andrew
