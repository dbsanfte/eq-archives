Say it with me skippy:  It's because generally PEOPLE ARE STUPIDER
THAN DIRT!

My twinkie warrior grouped with a single level 45 shaman outside of
Karnor.  We were pulling faster than a full group of players with a
cleric.

Slows are god spells, period.

In most pulls he never had to heal me, regen alone was sufficient to
keep me alive.

Of course it's a poor fucking game design!  This is Verant!

They *HAD* to do this.
Imagine Velketor that can be slowed.  Good grief, he's a gimp enough
mob as it is, but get Turgur on him?  He becomes a joke!

Verant had to make it so slows won't work against 99% of the boss mobs
(yes, I know Dozekar is slowable, what can I say, he's a gimp).  If
they didn't all the "challenge" of the game would be largely, getting
shamans to chain cast Turgur until it sticks.

Remember what happened to Mech-CT version 3.0?
Mech-CT version 2.0 was slowable.  They changed his resist table so
he's no longer slowable.  The whines of nerfs was pretty impressive.

60 comes faster than you think.

No kidding.
Complete heal is probably the single most broken spell in this game.
