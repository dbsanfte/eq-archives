C.R in a populated zone any day of the week for me!  Even if PoH waslevel 20
mobs, it would piss me off due to the fact I can't enter or exit the place
of my own accord.. don't like having to reply on others

C.R in CT maze.. wait till the train goes (minute or 2).. port back in with
your wizard (or get a tl).. your instantly in a safe area, and right at your
corpses.
