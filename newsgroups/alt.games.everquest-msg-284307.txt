I had exactly the same experience with a different quest mob when I
started off WoW.  We got to the spot, realized the mob was already
dead, asked what the respawn was (maybe in the general chat?) and we
were blown away when we realized that we didn't have to spend hours
waiting. 

The difference is that in EQ the whole purpose of the mob and PHs and
respawn is to slow you down.  In WoW, the respawn time is just long
enough to allow you to exit the area safely.  It's quite a pleasant
change.

I'm sure someone will say that this makes WoW too "easy" but when you
come down to it, killing the same PHs over and over and over and ...
again doesn't make a game harder, it just makes it a timesink.  There
generally wasn't a lot of skill in killing PHs, just what the old
German chessmasters used to call "Sitzfleisch", the ability to out-sit
your opponent until he gave up.  Not my idea of fun.
