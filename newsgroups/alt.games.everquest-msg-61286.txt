Are you positive about that? I'm not arguing for argument's sake, but I
really find it hard to believe... From what I've heard in Castersrealm
and other places, 256MB is the minimum amount if you want to see the new
character models. With 128, you still get the Vah'Shir and the new
environments. I should imagine that all the weapon and armor models you
aren't seeing will degrade to placeholders, like the Velious stuff for
people without the Velious expansion.
