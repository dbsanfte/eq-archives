It's been a while since I've done this, but I don't think the gypsies in
North Karana will talk to you if you are evil.  I've never heard of the
gypsies in Ro giving the book in exchange for Greater Lightstones the way
the ones in N. Karana do.

What you will need to do is you talk to a particular gypsy (can't remember
the name right now) and you give her the Greater Lightstone and in exchange
she will give you a book.  Then you can sell the book back to her for about
8pp ea.
