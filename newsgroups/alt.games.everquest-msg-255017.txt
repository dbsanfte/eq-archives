I agree that its best to hold them till last.  Even so, if the group
insisted in opening them as we go I would be ok with that.  I play a 65 bard
and when I sing psalm of veeshan (plus vots) everyone always resists the
trap (even L58's).  But usually what happens instead is some idiot just
opens it without warning so I dont have that song up.  We survive but its
stupid on a level with someone deciding to pull while Im already pulling.
