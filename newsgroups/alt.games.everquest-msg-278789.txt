| Two reasons it's a failed design concept:

| Slow and complete heal spring to mind. If you have the incredibly

| no matter how weak you make it initially, sooner or later it will be
| become so over powered that you will have to make content to assume
| everybody has it.
|
| Complete heal, well the name says it all really, overpowered from day
| one and only gets worse as people's maximum hitpoints increase. Even
| limited to 7500 hitpoints, this spell will continue to be overpowered
| until most folks usually have many times that.

You've left out snare, snare is at least as powerful and game breaking as
slow and complete heal. Is that because one or more of your characters can
snare?

Complete heal was not overpowered from day one. It wasn't until people began
having lots of health points that it became so powerful. Fast heals today
are more powerful in many ways than complete heal was back in the day when
you compare percentage of total mana, efficiency and cast time.

Slow has been modified by slow mitigation.
