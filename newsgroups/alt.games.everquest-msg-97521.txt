It just strikes me that we all kind of know that Norrath has two moons, and
one was hidden by Luclin (the deity/demi-deity from which it takes its
name), and that Luclin's only viewable from certain locations. . .

Whether it's been hidden on a plane is anybody's guess, save that the fact
that Norrath rises and sets in the sky implies that it isn't.  The absence
of sun is probably a side-effect of whatever Luclin did to the thing. . .
