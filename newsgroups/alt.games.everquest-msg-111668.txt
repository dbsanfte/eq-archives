I've done the magician epic.  The cleric epic is "easier" but nothing in the
magician epic even approaches the insanity of watching servers make lists
for who is going to get Ragefire for the next *YEAR*.

I'm sorry, but if I twink a cleric it won't take me a *YEAR* to get to 60. 
That's a screwed up situation, if I can actually consider making a character
and knowing that I need to put my name on the list at *LEVEL ONE* to even
have the chance to get my epic by the time I get to 60.
