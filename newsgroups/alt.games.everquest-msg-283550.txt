Oddly, one of the things my kids got me for Father's day was Prophecy of 
Ro.

Well I fired up the expansion, which took a while, what with downloading 
the patches for it and all.  Then I logged in and nothing looked 
different, played for a while before realizing that I had to go out and 
register it.  Almost paid for it a second time... turns out the trick, 
which of course I should have remembered, is to go into accounts and in 
there is a 'register expansion' option.

Anyway, the big change I see is 8 more spaces in the bank.

That seems to be about it, as far as content for a casual player. 
Haven't seen anyone looking for players to go to any POR zone in the 
week or so I've been back.  There's something about setting traps, but I 
don't see how, even on my new rogue.  Maybe he's not high enough, at 
10th level.

I can't find anything about the expansion online, just some ads and 
previews for it, but no "whats this all about" or walkthru's or hints... 
I don't need too much, but at the moment I'm just so in the dark that 
I'm pretty much missing it!

The one thing that  really strikes me as an interesting bonus is the 
free warhorse.  Is this a real mount?  As in no sitting meditation?  Or 
is it just an annoying graphic thing, like the bonuses in some of the 
previous expanions.
