Are you sure about that?  I was under the impression that a
significant minority said that they would pay extra for additional
service.  I know that I did, though I most likely won't be moving over
because I value my guild a LOT more than any GM events.

I don't think Verant EVER promised this level of support for the basic
account, but I didn't start playing until August of 99, so it's
possible it was only at intial release.  Either way it doesn't bother
me, I'm glad that Verant is moving ahead with this.  Paying more to
get more sounds good to me.

Where do you guys get this stuff, really?  Am I missing my decoder
ring or anything?  Have you looked at some of the gear that people get
from GM events?  It's often absolutely above and beyond what the
character could get off a mob or 	questing at that level.  (Of
course it ofen isn't that useful, I'm reminded of that really cool,
funky shield the Qeynos guards weild that was awarded to a Bard in a
GM event I participated in.  Excuse me, we're bards, we have
dual-weild!)
From everything I've read from Verant on this, the new items will be
special items awarded as part of interactive events.  Other than a few
crackpots, i don't think anyone bitches when someone who participates
in an event, and RPs well, gets a great item.  Now people are being
offered a chance to go to a server full of GM events, with the logical
expectation that there will be more GM awarded loot, and you're saying
Ebay.  Sorry, I just don't see it.

>I guess "protecting intellectual property" translates into english as

Well, actually, that's very true, that's exactly the definition of
intellectual property rights.  I know, I know, knowledge wants to be
free, and we're all a bunch of facist capitalists out to screw the
little guy.  You don't like it, don't pay.  

Do you have a problem with the fact that you can buy a Toyota for
$10,000, but you can't get a Lexus for under $30,000?  Does it bother
you that you have to pay extra for leather or a sunroof?  Even if the
ad for the car shows the sunroof?
