   Do that.  My life with Lenny has gotten ALOT better when we
got our own computers.  Then you can start duoing with her, as
well.  Lots of fun, if you both remember its just a game.  ("Hey,
sweetie... you... in the mood?" "After that overpull of yours and
_that_ CR?  STFU, noob!")

   A real simple combo to try is cleric and warrior.  Very very
simple for the most part... cleric throws heals and buffs,
warrior beats on stuff.  Other combo's might offer more in terms
of power and flexibility, but this one is a classic for a reason.
