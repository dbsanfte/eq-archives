Well, here is how it went -

Naggy spawned at 5:30PM (or thereabouts).  Arcane Evol are there with 18
people to take him down at 5:45PM.  My raid had been ITRed on MMDN for
7:30PM.  Luckily I was there early to start getting things organised and
catch any early comers.  AE upon hearing that we had ITRed it sought to
combine forces, to which I agreed.  We come to terms on the loot rules and
then they wanted to start clearing the FGs.

I ummed and arred over it but seeing as we were away off getting our force
together I let them.  Big mistake, apart from the fact that the FGs had
mostly been cleared by higher levels anyway, of course come time our force
got in their no one wanted to reform the groups (and I don't blame them).
But of course this only led to mass confusion.  Also before we got in there
AE were wiped out by an apparent 'Naggy train'.  Apart from the fact I
didn't think Naggy could be trained what moron would even do such a thing
anyway?  To say the least I wasn't all that surprised that they tried
to.....

Also because our force was so keen to get in there so AE didn't get it all a
lot got left to fend for themselves, especially those that didn't know the
way or went LD.  And most didn't want to go back to look for them/ rez etc.

Anyway, after a lot of mucking around we finally got things together and
took Naggy down.  Having some 50 people there was little doubt which way it
would go.  Someone commented that he went down quicker than the LDC that was
trained on our rearguard :-).

But lesson - first, at least on Mith Marr a lot of guilds have no respect
for raiding intentions.  Secondly, if you ITR something and another guild
wants to combine then THEY JOIN YOU, and everything from start to finish
gets done together.

In the end all went well and it was fun, it just saddens me how some people
are just so selfish when it comes to raiding.
