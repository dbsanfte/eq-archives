OK, really dumb question (since I've not been to NK before); I looked
at the www.eqatlas.com map of NK and there on the south side near SK
entrance is a spot labeled "teleportation ring".  So can you just go
that spot and get ported to GF even if you're not a druid/wizard, or
do you still need to have a druid/wizard port you from that spot?
