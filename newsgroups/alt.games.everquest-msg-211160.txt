Interesting (to me) tidbits

- minimum 4person groups

- maximum 11,000 dungeon instances at once
(44k-66k simultaneous users in dungeons)

- Players can select the level of difficulty, thus
allowing Time/Elemental players to select something 
challenging, while NToV players can select something
more in line with their gear/capabilities.

- Different adventure types ranging from save the
hostage, assassinate the boss to clear the dungeon

- Time limit on adventures (this was an indirect
observation during an answer on recovering corpses
from dungeons)

- While not as automated as PoP GY's, the dungeons
do spit out players/bodies when the group fails the
dungeon.

- Item enhancements go on the item, not the slot.

- Enhancements are individually limited as to which
type of item they might enhance.

- Different types of items have different limits to
how many enhancements can go on them

- You can remove an enhancement from an item (thereby
freeing up the enhancement slot) but the enhancement
is destroyed.

- You can inspect an enhancement and see the changes
it will make before adding it to an item.

- No faction needed to start adventuring.

- No overarching quest/story like PoP

- No new AA's

- New items come from Rare mobs, chests etc. and
the new item rewards system (building points with
the Wayfarers).

- All 48 new dungeons are available to every level
PC from 20-65.
