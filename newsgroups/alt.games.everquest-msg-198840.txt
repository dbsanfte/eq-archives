Fair enough. I guess I just don't see where it's such an issue. I am not 
eagerly chomping at the bit to get back into the game when the servers 
come back up. I go to bed, the patches start, I get up and go to work, 
and when I get home and am able to play they are almost always back up. I 
can only remember like maybe twice in over two years that that wasn't the 
case, so I guess I don't have any reason for any level of agitation in 
the matter.

Besides, there are always other things to do for a portion of a day.
