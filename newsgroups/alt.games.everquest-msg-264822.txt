Well, just to show how relative a phrase like "not that much money"
can be, EA's net revenue for "Subscription Services" was $13 million
last quarter.  Not sure how much of that is from Ultima Online, but
it's probably the majority of that figure.   They only have three other
subscription services, Earth and Beyond, The Sims Online and Club Pog,
the later being a paid version of their free web-based games

Hmm... reading their 2004 annual report it seems The Sims Online was a
big disaster for them.  They invested a lot of money in it assuming it
would become their flagship online title, and it didn't sell anywhere
near as well as they assumed it would.  It definately looks like a good
example of a game that, while it has enough subscribers to keep it running
profitably, will never make back the investment the company put into it.

Yah, he does seem to have his biases and his analysis of MMOGs on that
WWW page largely ignores what his charts actually show.
