Prey tell, how exactly SoL would help the lad escape from Freeport?

IF he could get to North Karana, or to Greater Faydark, then he'd already
be OUT of the Freeport hole.

And if he's trying to get from Freeport to Qeynos, even that NK portal
won't do all that much good; I mean sure, he can go NK Nexus Tox Erud Eruds
Crossing, Qeynos... but it would be simpler to go WK QH NQ.
