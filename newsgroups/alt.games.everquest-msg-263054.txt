well i started eq through a friends recommendation on vallon zek.  at first
it was very hard.  I picked a warrior which i was a very easy target for all
casters.  Number one stat on a pvp server is Magic Resistance.  Without it
your pretty much done.  I played the warrior till about lvl 25 where I was
soloing a lot since my friends weren't playing much.  Then I started a bard
which at high lvl is probebly the best pk character there is if u play it
good.
I no longer play eq though.  Here is why.  I chose a soloing character which
i soloed 90% of the way to 65.  Soloing sux.  I made no friends and played
in hardly any groups.  I didn't know how to play my class in a group.  I got
guilded in a very good guild and a few people helped me out and I became
better but my playing time didn't match with any guild since i usually
played late at night around midnight pst and no one is raiding at that time.
I would have started a new character like a cleric that everyone needs but
reflagging sux so i just quit and now await release of eq2.  I enjoyed pvp
cause u can fight your way to a mob or take over a camp that another group
has.  Main rule on pvp is don't pvp while a character or group is on a mob
but as soon as he goes down go for it.  I heard on Rallon zek that they
don't care and pvp anytime.  U can settle a lot of disputes due to pvp.  I
remember my first pvp kill.  OMG it was such a rush.  I was in S. Karana and
met a SK who started to pvp me after a kill.  I zoned and prepared as i was
getting pwrlvled by a high lvl druid.  I was around lvl 25 or so.  He buffed
me up and i zoned back and he was waiting for me.  We fought a nice long
fight as i was meleeing him and was a even fight. (healing by a high lvl
character is greatly frowned apon) but it came down to the two of us
jousting and i won.  I was sooo happy i was shaking and couldn't believe the
feeling my body had.  Just  a total rush.

How i met this druid was his main was a lvl 55 necro who delvled all the way
back to lvl 25 and he liked to hang out in PC and all he really did was pvp
people there.  He had high lvl twink gear on him and saw him pk a group of
people by himself.

There are a few more rules like if u lose a pvp u can loot your corpse but
must leave after that for a hour.  Nothing is etched in stone though but if
u continue to stay in the zone be prepared to get killed again and again and
again.  There was a time where this guy wouldn't quit and i mezzed his naked
body for 30 mins.  Was pretty funny for me acually as i let the mezz break a
few times and just remezz him.  He was shouting pretty good in /ooc.

I had a good time on pvp and would never play on a non pvp server except in
eq2 since i will have no choice but will move to one as soon as one becomes
available.   GL to u
