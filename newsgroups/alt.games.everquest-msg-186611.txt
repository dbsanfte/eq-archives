Well, I have not been happy with ANY of the places the Shaman's crucible has
suggested for a level 52 almost 53 shaman in terms of soloing. Don't like
CoM, didn't like the other places either. So, If I mention somes zones I
liked (and ones I didn't) perhaps an interesting suggestion can be garnished
with that in mind. I like a nice mix of fast XP and loot. (who doesn't?). If
I had to choose, I'll go with XP.

My most recent Favorite Zones:

1. Tenebrous Mountains: Good hunting, empty, good loot
2. Dawnshroud Peaks: Same reason, more crowded
3. Scarlet Desert: Same reasons as Tenebrous Mountains
4. Ice Giants in EP but so hard to get a camp!

Suggestions please!
