all the crap in and around the cells nearest the zone-out of Plane of
Justice, minus Slram <something or other>, a nasty iksar

my 52 war can just barely finish off the weaker ones, and i don't have any
outstanding gear, so you should do well...also, if you aren't engaging
something, you won't aggro other things, so you can bw / clicky heal right
out in the open

sorry if the answer 'poj' is too common, like the 'paludal' for the 50+
crowd....

it gets boring as hell, running, clicking open the door to a room that has a
window to a graveyard (and thereby the most annoying gfx lag spikes ever)
over and over, but the exp is easy
