Is there something special to the first hit the mobs land on you? It's 
not a scientific assessment, but I've found that blue mobs that don't 
generally hit me for much or very often tend to land the first hit with 
a lot more frequency (and for more damage) than would seem likely, 
looking at how the subsequent fight goes.

So... is there a special calculation going on for the first hit, or am I 
hitting the  crackpipe again?
