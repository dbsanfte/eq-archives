Well, aside from the warnings that you shouldn't do it because it's
addicting...

7 or 8 months mean you probably don't know about the new zones (Warrens,
Stonebrunt), seriously revamped dungeons (Runnyeye, Chardok spring to mind),
massive tradeskill upgrades, serious class balancing and so much more.

Considering you were level 16 I doubt you'll notice very much difference
though. I would suggest to run through some patch messages here and there
and maybe some of the reactions here in the newsgroups (Google has a large
archive) to give an idea of the biggest changes.
Oh you can buy/sell/pick up things now with shift for whole stacks and ctrl
for single items of a stack.

Also there are some nice changes going on and will probably result in a new
plane and of course Luclin.
