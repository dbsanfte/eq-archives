Sometimes you need to cast these spells on your way to fetch your
corpse.  

Bound at scarelet desert, hunting in the grey, and if you die...
you're a heck of a long way from EC. :-)


Levitation drops from a named underbulk in The Deep.  Doable with a
single group of 55+.  I have this spell.


I have heard that everlasting breath drops from named vampires in the
castle in Tenebrous Mountains, though I know of no one who has this
spell, and have yet to see anyone say they have personally seen it
drop.
