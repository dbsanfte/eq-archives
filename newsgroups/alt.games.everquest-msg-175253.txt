> I like the look of the chest-straps thing and HATE the dress look.

Not sure what Acrylia looks like.  You might try the fashion tables on
Allakhazam.  I agree with you on the dress look, always thought that looked
stupid.  Can you imagine a RL monk trying to fight in a dress? and a purple
one at that! What self respecting monk would wear a purple dress?  I can't
believe they couldn't come up with better graphics for monk gear.  I always
like the look of Jacki Chan's Chinese outfit with the wide legged
split-skirt look.  Oh well-I'll stop rambling now.
