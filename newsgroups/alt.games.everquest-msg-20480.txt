The naming policy already provides for an *enormous* range of freedom,
for anyone with even a modicum of creativity.

I suspect that you don't want merely more freedom to choose names, but

players into account, and temper it with what they think is best for
the game overall. Happily, your opinion seems to be pretty well
matched by the opposing position.
