Actually FoN stacks with Warders and PoTW.
Though I usually run the extra ds off my 8th Coldain ring (mainly cause I'm
lazy and like the insta buffle with out having to keep a slot devoted to
FoN)
Additionally for warders and PoTW Natures Precision stacks so if you really
want to go for max atk then NP and FoN in addition to warders of PoTW is the
way to go. Unless your running wolf form which doesn't stack with FoN. But
does with Shield of the 8s.

Don't forget Natures Precision when running one of the all in one buffs. (WP
PoTW)

Actually this has finally been fixed. The pink heart no longer overwrites
SoN and SoT. Which ever is cast first holds.
