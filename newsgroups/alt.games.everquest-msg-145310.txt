The Shaman makes for the best partner in a 2 box situation, imo.
Heals like a Druid but at 39th can slow better than a 44th Enchanter and
that makes so much difference. Plus the other buffs and self mana regen
makes for less down time, shame canII is such a pig to get.

I can't offer any better ideas for 2 boxing, I can say the Druid Warrior duo
will be limited post 50, even with superior heal mobs just hit too hard and
fast.
I 3 box with an Enchanter, with my Druid/Warrior, which makes life a lot
easier but even so, I meet something High Forties and I can find myself
chain healing while I try and get shiftless deeds to stick.

I'd stick with the Cleric and Shaman as Healer class, I suppose Monk is
probably the best choice as for melee with it's high damage output and FD.
