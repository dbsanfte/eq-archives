Note that if you can't find customers to buy banquet meals, shark
rolls and fish rolls sell for the same amount to vendors, and shark
meat costs roughly half of what fresh fish does.
I bought a spit recently and got my baking from 70 to 135 in 3 game
sessions by making shark rolls while medding and got half a gold in
profit per stack (phat lewt? :) ) - now I have to go learn pottery :)
