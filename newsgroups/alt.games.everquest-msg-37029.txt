[EDIT: Ok, I missed the part about "Refusing to respond if they
don't offer plat", my bad. Even so, if you really want a rez,
the best way to get one is to offer to pay. If you don't want
to pay a cleric to take the time off to rez you, why should he
bother? Out of the kindness of his heart? Yeah, I've done that
quite a few times, but given how strapped for cash clerics can
find themselves, I still understand Scott's reasoning]

Ever played a cleric? We get to pay for expensive spells, armor
AND reagents. Oh yeah, and we have to pay those "greedy, stingy
bastard" druids for ports too... And if we get off our medding
asses to loot, we'll get yelled at for sure. Damned if we do,
damned if we don't...

I can understand Scott's desire to make money off rezzes, when
I was in my 30s, I was really HURTING for money. I was constantly
broke (no joke, empty bank account), and every plat I got usually
went to cover the aforementioned costs pretty much instantly...

I had 1000 plat in the bank for the first time in my life when I
hit 44, IIRC...

[EDIT: But still, this part I gotta take issue with: Who are you
to tell Scott how much to charge for his service?]
In article <8r9potgas7339jv3uaio6f5bp0p8ne80mn@4ax.com>, he went
on to say:

>Anyway, back on rezzes... 100pp for a rez is simply absurd. I could

Yeah! Who does the cleric think he is, deciding how much his own
time is worth? Moneygrubber! Capitalist! He'll be first against
the wall when the revolution comes, Tovarich!
