Will Verant ever admit this is a problem?  I am now writing this because I
went LD, have rebooted computer twice (which obviously means my ISP
connection was stopped), but yet still have an active character!  Shouldn't
be going LD anyway with an AMD 1800+, 1 gig of 2100 pcram, and a GEFORCE II,
but I have figured that will never be fixed...I would just ask that after
going LD that I should be able to log back in BEFORE my place in the group
is given away because they are tired of waiting for me!....rant over, Verant
doesn't care or they would fix the error 1018 bug......
