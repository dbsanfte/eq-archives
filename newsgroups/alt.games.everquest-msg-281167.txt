That doesn't necessarily mean anything, as I used an ancient old 32meg
PCI card for a couple of years, and that wasn't "supported" either.

I'd take anything Sony say with a pinch of salt, given that your card
worked up to now, and keep tinkering.  After all, Sony say on their
website:  "The Test Server is where new program code is tested, before
it is used on the regular playing servers" which only goes to prove
how much crap they talk.  This last week is living proof of that  :D
