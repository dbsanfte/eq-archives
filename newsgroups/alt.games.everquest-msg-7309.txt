Some time I'd like to see the source of this information. I personally don't
see a difference between levelling in LOIO or FoB or OT. With my Iksar monk
I can usually get 1/2 blue bubble of exp soloing blue mobs just about
anywhere. Yeah, that's not a whole lot of exp, but I've got that racial
penalty working against me. Whether it's Iksar recruits in LOIO or forest
giant evergreens in WW. It's exactly the same in both places. If one has an
advantage, it's got to be very slight (i.e. not noticeable). Today I nearly
finished level 31 killing giants in WW.. just as fast as I got through 29 in
LOIO.

But.. this one "fact" causes LOIO to be one of the most heinously
overcrowded zones in the game. On Lanys there are always more than 100
people in the zone in the evening. The most I saw was 126 and that was on a
weekday night!  The people seem to be getting ruder and ruder as well..
including kiting bloodgill goblins right through where other people were
hunting. Nothing more distracting than wondering if you'll get killed by a
high red while you're just minding your own business.

Anyhow.. now that I've gotten through hell I think I'm FINALLY through with
LOIO. And, if I level another Iksar up I'll use the giant fort and brutes in
WW for exp. Much more enjoyable than LOIO. For sure! :-)
