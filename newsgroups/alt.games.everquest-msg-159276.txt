I'd sorta wondered about aggro management with CHeal...
especially given the habit of tanks of running off to pull when
you *really* want to heal them *now*, rather than waiting
for a bubble of damage to accumulate when they get back.

I was paired with a 44 cleric a few weeks ago in DL and he
was using CHeal consistently, partly so the MT could berzerk
a bit. I figure most of the tanks I'm with at the moment, SHeal
heals about 2 bubbles worth; for CHeal to be worthwhile
they'll have to be almost 80% down... which scares me, my
main job isn't to conserve mana, it's to keep the group alive.
Mana conservation is a means to an end, not an end in itself.

I suppose what it comes down to is the common-sense
approach, to mem the spells you need for the situation you're
in. I'd never mem CHeal when soloing, for example(*). Just as I
only mem the undead nukes when there are lots of undead
around, and sometimes mem Enstill when doing crowd
control. And don't bother with Valour when grouped with a
druid because I *know* they'll overwrite it with some Skin
or other...

Getting the tanks to stand still is the problem here - esp. when
the main tank is also puller. Or at least that's the problem I
get with SHeal.

I've used something along these lines before, with smaller heals,
when mana is low - tell the group I'm LOM, and the tanks try
to share the hurt. But I'd rather avoid that situation in the first place...

The next question today is... peridots. How the heck do clerics
avoid going completely broke after they hit level 44?

(*) Anybody who things clerics never solo needs a reality check.
In OT last night on my server (Cazic-Thule), things were just
*dead*. I uncamped and found I was the only one in the zone.
Only 3 people in FM and about as many in LOIO. Didn't check
DL, the place still scares me, so I soloed giants for a while.
