Yes, Trolls also have a 20% penalty (Trolls and Iksar both have 20%
penalty because they have regeneration).  Ogres also have a 15%
penalty (I think because they are large race and can't be stunned from
the front) and Barbarians have 5% penalty (for being large race?).
Halflings actually have a 5% bonus (not sure why, but I heard that
allegedly it was humans who were supposed to get the 5% bonus but that
Verant goofed up and gave it to Halflings instead)
