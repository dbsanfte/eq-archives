/agree
FoB is by far one of the sweetest newbie zones I've ever leveled up in,
and I've done most of them. And only a one minute run from the gates of
home is the entrance to Kurn's Tower. If the previous poster's lizard is
lvl 12, that's an ideal level to start in Kurns. And you can *easily* go
to level twenty in there, and well beyond if you have the patience. 
After that, of course, you have a selection of either some of the nicer
mid-range dungeons in the game, or the boring old, mind numbing LoIO -
FM - OT - DL.  Again, all without ever having to leave home.
