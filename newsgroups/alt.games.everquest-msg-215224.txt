you betcha, skippy.
i am slowly making friends, but unfortunately when i end up in groups, 
and start playing with {frex} several members of guild X, they try to 
recruit me and when I let tehm know i am not interested in reguilding, 8 
of 10 times they slowly back away...I can understand grouping as a way 
to recruit, but i dont see why people in guilds feel the need to group 
almost exclusively with their guild, if they can find people that are 
competent that arent guilded...but the 2 people who will still play with 
me not being in their guild are definitely worth it. LOL just tonight I 
met a necro who was kind enough to come and bail me out along with his 2 
guildies from howling...and we spent much of the evening together 
mucking around...and for giggles we raided the orcs in east 
commons....amazing how much damage a 65 necro and a 55 cleric can do wth 
just weapons=) I know I was using a soupripper and he was using a 
prismatic brawling stick [at least that is what it looked like]
