   I would assume that all that would really be needed a trip to the Hole, and
the ability to perform quickly under what can only be described as very trying
circumstances.

   Monual has Divine Aura, so would survive the trip down.  And he is ubar
enough to laugh at whatever greets him when he and his partner lands.  Heck, if
he's with another cleric, or a high enough leveled Necro, they could come of the
ride alive also.  If not, a click of his epic would make everything all right.

   However, to answer your important question, I think that he writes out of the
urge that his skill and creativity gives rise to, rather than any hope such a
mundane, if heart-stopping, reward.
