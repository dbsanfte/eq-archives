Win98 was great. Trouble is, MS isn't really supporting it anymore.
The MS Windows update page no longer provides a convenient interface
for patches.

Me too actually. Can't go wrong if you have the budget.

Not familiar with 1066 RDRAM, but I use PC800 RDRAM in my system and
am pleased with it. Would suggest 768MB or 1GB for best performance -
again, pending budget considerations.

Abit boards have kept me happy.

GeForce 4 TI cards should be fine (better than my GF3 GTS), although
the new ATI cards really look nice on paper.

Avoid Creative SB Live! sound cards though. Don't know about the
Audigy cards, they may be ok. This is one area where I've heard people
champion the cheaper OEM stuff.

Non-issue really.

Pretty much.
