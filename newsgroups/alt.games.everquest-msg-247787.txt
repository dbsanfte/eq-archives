   That wasn't an accusation, Ben.  It was an insinuation, to be sure. 
And, I think, a deserved one.  Val does sound *just* like a sock puppet in
his replies to this post.  I was about google his name myself before I
realized that I did recognize him.  True, Danni should have googled it
himself before posting that. 

  But he did have cause.
