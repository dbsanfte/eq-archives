Totally wrong? I wouldn't say that. Necros don't want my C2, unless
they are lazy, and don't want to lifetap. My haste doesn't stack with
their pet buff. Really, there are no buffs a necro might want from me,
except maybe the small regen from Gift of Insight/Englightenment.

However, this doesn't mean I wouldn't want to group with a necro. I
have a level 58 one, and am well-aware of what they can do. The
problem is that there are so many necros that solo their entire
career, and don't know what they're doing. Of course, at lower levels
I would be much more likely to gives the clueless ones a chance to
learn.
