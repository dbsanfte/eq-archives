I've got a Vah Shir Beastlord which I play when a friend of mine is on EQ
also.  Doing my first quest I've ran into a problem trying to make the
bandages.  The quest giver says 2 silks = 1 thread, 2 threads = 1 bandage, 3
bandages + pattern = handwraps.  Problem is when I tried to combine the 2
threads to make the bandage, I got message that I combined to make something
new, and at the same time message that I lacked the skill?  I thought you
get either one or other, but not both?

What skill for tailoring is needed to complete this quest?

Also should I have /report and /petition just to make them aware of this or
is this bug already known (the 2 message issue)?

I didn't see an item on my cursor so I assume the 2nd message saying I
failed was the true one.
