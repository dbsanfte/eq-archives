You have more money than DT?  I am going to go WAAAYYYY out on a limb and 
guess that DT made a LOT more than $6200 in the past 2.5 years.  I'm even 
going to suggest that DT made a lot more than $5000 since DAoC was 
released.  
Now, I'm going to show what a fucking total tool you really are.  You 
claim to have made $1200 selling 3 EQ accounts, which averages out to 
$400/each.  I looked at account prices before Verant came down on ebay 
sales (was thinking about a port-mule), and I'm going to assume that the 
characters you sold were level 50 or so.  
You give no indications of any intelligence above that of the average 
houseplant, but I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume 
that you are some kind of EQ idiot-savant.  Let's say you are able to get 
your sale characters to level 50 in 10 days played.  That works out to 240 
hours per character, or $1.67/hour.  Ohhh, you're soooo fucking smart, and 
soooo fucking rich, can I be like you?  This also pretty much assumes that 
you had to have some character to PL your sale characters, so we should 
probably factor in the time getting your PL character up to speed.  
Maybe there's a reason that you think that $1.67/hour is good money, but 
for those of us making 20-30 times that amount, for 40 hours every week, 
it's literally pocket-change.
