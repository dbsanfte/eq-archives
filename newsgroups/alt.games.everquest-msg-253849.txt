Thanks for all the replies. So, as a player that will likely never hit 
level 20, it Luclin the only expansion worth buying given the graphics 
update and bazaar? Most of the other expansions seem fairly focused on 
the higher-end game, which I'll never get to.

Also, why doesn't my Journal work? I have the button but when I click it 
nothing happens. I read something that implied that it was a feature of 
one of the expansions, is that the case?
