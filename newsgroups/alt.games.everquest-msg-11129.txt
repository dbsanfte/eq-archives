Thanks for the info - yup it is my patch day, but I wanted to see if I
caould get the patch - and then as it crashed once it had 'completed' I
checked the dbg.txt.  And the problem occuring had nothing to do with
connecting to the servers or not - EQ would not even launch.

In fact it did connect to the servers because it downloaded the patch.

My concern is that whenever the downtime is over, will I actually be able to
play or is this problem still going to be outstanding - a request for a file
which isn't there?
Or is it likely that nearer the end of the patch downtime a 'fix' for this
will be released?
