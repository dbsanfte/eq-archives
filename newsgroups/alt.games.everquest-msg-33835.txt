Well, not possible with the built-in macro support.  Not sure if a
programmable game controller could do it.  Xylobot could probably
do it.

Also, arrange you things so that they are in the bag in the order you
want to swap them, and since it saves bag positions now, have the
bag pre-positioned next to the "what you are wearing" display.

Take advantage of swapping on both ends.  Some people do this:

	1. Click item in bag.
	2. Click item they are currently wearing.
	3. Click on the empty slot in bag.

That leaves them with an empty cursor.  Better is this:

	1. Click first item in bag.
	2. Click item you are currently wearing.
	3. Click *next* item in bag.

That leaves you with the next item to swap on the cursor.  You've saved
a click on the next swap!
