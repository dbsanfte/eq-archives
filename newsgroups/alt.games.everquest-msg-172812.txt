You miss the point.  My bard is Dubious to thurgadin... and to Kromiff and Kromzek.
I don't want to change this delicate state of balance, I'm safe from molestation in
Kael and Thurgadin both, and for that matter avoid a lot of hassle in GD and EW and
IO and WL.

My cleric is capable of soloing in Kael, and I also have access to a lot of other
high level people who do so from time to time for faction and have unwanted MQable
thurg armor.

IF my bard can get himself to amiable via bard charm, then he could pick up some nice
armor upgrades in Thurgadin, without despoiling his faction in Kael.

Getting to Warmly or Kindly from Dubious would mean totally hosing giant faction, AND
it wouldnt' be the trivial exercise you were thinking of; I'm not getting from
Amiable to Warmly... since the Amiable status is being achieved artificially by
charming the quest mob; this status can't be improved, its either good enough or it
isn't.  In fact, if I go out and charm a mob I'm Ally to, my status for him will
-drop- to amiable, unless I'm very much mistaken. (experiment now required before I
can go to bed)

Llryic

ps: whats the faction hit for -doing- the quest?  would be sad if I were to screw my
faction by doing this in this way after having gone to such lengths to -avoid-
screwing faction!
