I do kill placeholders.  *sigh* I killed everything I saw then ran over 
the hill to see all the kiters sitting there with 2 or 3 each *weep*

Still.  I admit you have a point about lag.

I didn't even know there *was* a Hasten 'cycle'.  Although I was damn

and he came tearing through and stopped to look at me for a second. *g*
