Good idea.  That said, early on, you'll want to make 1HS your main focus.
Your first "epic" piece will be the Ghoulbane, which is 1HS.  With a good
group, you can get it at about 20 or so (which is good, since that's when it
starts to proc).  This also lets you bash, which is essential against caster
mobs (though not so much, with the addition of the Cease and Desist spells
in ShadowHaven).  When you're in Crushbone, make a concerted effort to get a
Shiny Brass Shield, which drops off the orc trainers.  This will allow you
to bash mobs like willowisps and ghouls, which can only be hit by magic
weapons.

OTOH, around 30, 2HS weapons start to become king.  Your second, and third
epic pieces, as well as the epic it self are 2H (Soulfire, around lvl 40;
Firey Avenger, around 50; Firey Defender, 50+ - the Paladin epic is cool, in
the fact that it truely is "epic" starting with a level five or so quest,
and going all the way to the FD, with usable components along the way).
Also, I believe Nature Defender (Tunare only alternate epic, it's Firiona
Vie's own sword) is 2H as well.  The advantage of these is that you can bash
with your epic, so the shield isn't necessary.

Heh, take care that wanderlust doesn't get the best of you.  I've lost many
levels due to the strange need to go "elsewhere," wherever that is.

Dunno, personally, I prefer Blackburrow, but CB is better about trains.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
