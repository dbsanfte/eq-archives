You see, you are not understanding yet.  It is quite possible to group 
without KEI, and not have to sit around medding before pulling again.  I 
have done it many times, I will do it again in the future.  If you are 
not capable of doing so, then you need to learn better how to play the 
game.  Soloing is different, there is downtime associated with it, even 
with KEI.

As to actually, heaven forbid, having a conversation with other people, 
yes, that can be fun.
