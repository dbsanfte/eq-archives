The thing about batwings...keep in mind that there are quite a few locations
throughout Norrath where you can buy batwings in unlimited numbers (well, as
long as you have the money to pay for them) for about 2s each.  A lot of the
buyers are buying from newbies to simply reward them for their hard work but
don't get greedy when you set a price.

Me, personally, I'd never buy wings from someone who auctions them for more
than 1g each, though I'll always overpay (usually up to 5g each) when the
seller ISN'T being greedy.
