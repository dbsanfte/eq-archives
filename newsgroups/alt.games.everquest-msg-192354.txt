 From what I can gather, someone was awarded a Blade of War, which drops
rarely from Rallos Zek, simply for helping judge a costume contest at
the last Fan Faire.

 The Fan Faire coordinator denied it at first then looks like he got
word from higher up that they did indeed hand the item out. Imagine his
surprise at looking like a dope.

 What do you make of that? The idea of a reward doesn't seem out of line
but the reward itself does. From reading the thread there are only two
Blade of Wars on Veeshan: both in Fires of Heaven. And now there's a
third, being handed out to an unguilded warrior for nothing related to
ingame activities.
