Then it didn't *eliminate* grinding, which was my point.
Grinding still exists and is still faster leveling.

I've never had the problem so I can't relate.  If it's time to
/quit, it's time to /quit.   When getting XP becomes a chore,
I do something else.   "Blue exp' or 'vitality' doesn't change
that -- if I want to adventure, I want to adventure.  The
rate of XP gain doesn't change that.

I think it's a good feature for the players who'd be 'left behind'
because they don't play as much.  That's a good thing if
someone has to take off a few days because they'll level
faster and catch back up.   But players who grind will still
level faster.

The biggest issue with it is the increased leveling rate across
the board.   It's not only the hard-core gamers who hit the
level cap;  everyone can faster than they would otherwise.
That means fewer players in lower-level zones for shorter
amounts of time, more players in higher-level zones, more
high-level crafters, etc.   "Extra exp" creates its own issues,
zone population issues, mudflation, etc.
