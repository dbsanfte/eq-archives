Dont worry...there is hardly anyone in Qeynos or Erudin on any server.
Check out Blackburrow when you hit about level 5...if thats empty, try
another server.
If you are from the US, change to a different server, because Kane Bayle is
a European server, and therefore less people will be online when you are.
