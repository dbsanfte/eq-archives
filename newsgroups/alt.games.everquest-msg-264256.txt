there are asshats on every server=) their loss, i think 22 levels 
of fighting means that i am a bard that learned how to play 
instead of someone who magically popped up at 25. It is hard to 
meet people because doing it the hard way [feh, fun way] only 
people I saw were some people in north ro wayfarers getting ready 
to do an adventure whizzing past me while I slogged away killing 
snakes for the preserved eye, and the coyote skull. Was a relief 
having all of paludal to myself, no trains, no inane 
conversations in ooc, no people complaining about camp stealing=)
