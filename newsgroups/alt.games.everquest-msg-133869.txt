WoW! Jackpot! Those mocassins are OMG too! Grats on reaching the next
stage - hopefully we're right on your heals hehe.

That was why we lost the time before. Got him to 60%, driving along
nicely, then suddenly the rods ran out, clerics ran oom, and you can
guess the rest.

Some of our warriors do, but I'm left unimpressed. Discharged 5 shots
like an uzi one emp run, whist looking up his skirt (metaphorically).
He's just popped, and totally ignored our initial plans to drag him to
the kill group, chosing to charge ATs instead. Less than 2 seconds after
popping, no-one had cast on him directly, and 5 chain snares didn't make
him bat an eyelid. As with a lot of warrior tactics, it comes down to
personal preference I guess.

But that is where warriors fall behind. Pal and especially SK are
infinitely better than warriors at no-damage offtanking a mob, and/or
picking up an enchanter's loose mob. It's also easier for them to hold
that agro while it's remezzed. A decently equipped SK can hold both 58s
indefinately, with a minimum of healing. Give em KEI and regen and their
pretty much self sufficient. The more healing they get, the slower their
mobs die, and the occasional torp from the shaman who's there anyway,
frees up people from bein tied to the AT group needlesly

The last attempt (Red sliver) we had 5 'useable' warriors, but one of
them hit the wrong disc, so was pretty useless. 4 MTs, we died quite a
lot, and it was a bit of a zerg on the MT team, but we learned what's
needed - a tighter system. Bear in mind the other 2 high level guilds
were also in the zone, topped out at 145 on /who, so we had far too many
random LDs to deal with too.
