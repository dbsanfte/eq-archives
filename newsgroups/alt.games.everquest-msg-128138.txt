Hey, I always found it a wonderful opportunity for role-playing.  When
someone sends a zone-wide shout that my familiar is hanging out at the
spires in DL or the entrance of CC looking lost, I usually make up some
story about him having an aversion to heights.  Makes no sense with the
wings, but he never does get more than two feet off the ground.
