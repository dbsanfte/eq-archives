How are they going to test if something is balanced in EQ2 by putting
it in a game that is almost completely unlike EQ2?  It's hard enough
to balance a game by testing out changes in the game itself or on
paper, to test them in another game entirely would be monumentally
stupid.

And we all know that it's impossible for them to add anything to EQ in
an attempt to make EQ more enjoyable, because the whole point of EQ
development is to drive people away from the game, right?
