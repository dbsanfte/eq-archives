Congratulations! I did that quest at about 30, and was scared to death
worrying that my invis would drop, too.  You got a nice item, and you should
visit Alla's and look up the rest of those PoK quests.  There are about 6 or
so,and they all have a nice focus item on them.  Great for mid range
characters.

Good luck, and thanks for the story!
