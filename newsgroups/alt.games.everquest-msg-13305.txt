Not my experience at all. I found your comment to be true when
charming mobs that con yellow or higher, but not for blue cons. I dont
even try to charm yellow or above anymore. Even if charm breaks, there
are more options to deal with it than you have listed. For one thing,
you can charm a different mob, maybe the one you were originally
trying to kill. Or, if both mobs are beat up and now chasing you, root
them both and dot them to death. Or, you can potentially use mem blur
to de-agro one of the mobs.

It certainly is the class defining ability. What other class get's a
charm anything line (disregarding bards, they get everything)? Lots of
classes have crowd control of various degrees.

AE is the defining ability for wizards as well. That is the one area
where they have a very clear advantage over any other class. Just
because you've never grouped with people who competently use AE,
doesn't mean those of us who have are liars. I guess you've never
heard of the very succesful AE groups based around multiple wizards
and enchanters, chaining stuns and AE nukes? There is more than one
way to play EQ, despite what you may believe.

For you, this may be true. Not every tool is right for every job. Just
because a circular saw makes a poor hammer, does not make the circular
saw useless, and a "sideline". Same with charm. Just because you are
afraid of using this ability, does not make it a worthless ability for
everyone. I use it, and make it pay.

Yep, I agree. But like I said before lots of spell lines are
unreliable. You take that into account when using it, and plan
accordingly. Or, in your case, give up and move the spells to the back
of your spellbook.

Did you move root back there with charm too?

I disagree. It's incredibly powerful, and a lot of fun.

Groups I get in are asking me to charm adds. They see the power. I
don't charm everything, but used with skill, it's awesome. A high
green mob makes a fine pet, and they are easy to charm. I routinely
have green mob charms lasting through 3 fights. Charmed mobs do the
same damage as they would normally, which is a lot more than pets of
comparable level.

I have died from charms going wrong, though not so much lately as I've
learned how to use it better. I haven't died yet when charming while
in a group. Nor have any of my groupmates died because of charm. In
fact, one guy died because I didn't have a caiman available to charm
and send after a DW croc.

Actually, charm is really a form of crowd control. I use it that way
sometimes. Mez line is not defining for chanters, because the effect
is shared with other classes.

You seem to have a very narrow view of what's acceptable for your
class. Don't you find that playing the same way all the time to get
boring? There really is more than one way to kill stuff in EQ.
