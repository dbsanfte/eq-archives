Healing, HP buffing, and DS buffing pets certain work, and its easy to see
this in practice.  The pet has a visible HP bar... wait till it gets hurt and
cast a heal on it.  Bar restores some, right?  OK, thats one down.  Now
Slap a big HP buff on a low level pet.  Watch the bar as it gets hurt...goes
down slower than before, doesn't it?  Double check this; slap a heal
on... doesn't seem to do as much, right?  Its doing the same HP of heal,
but with that HP buff up thats a smaller percentage of the total.   DS the
pet, and watch the stuff hitting it get chopped to shreds much quicker than
before.  Yep, that works too.

Now AC buffs are harder to judge, you'll need to figure out how much
damage the pet usually takes in a given fight, then give him a good AC
buffing, and see if he gets hit less and for less damage over the run of
several fights.  My gut says yes, but I've never run the numbers.

Stat buffs are even harder to judge... same process, mind you, but
looking at the damage the pet dishes out over time, instead of the
reverse.

I very much doubt you'll see any effect for  Int, Wis, or Mana buffs..
although mage pets do cast, they don't seem to ever run out of mana
or fizzle.

Hmm, what else.  Regen, that's questionable, pet regen rate is
already thru the roof, its possible that your regen won't even take.

SOW, that definately works.  Get a SOW and run a distance, watch
your pet lag way behind (don't go too far, you may lose him.)  Now
have the pet SOW'd too... and do another lap.  Look, Loser keeps
up just fine now!

What won't work?  Group buffs won't hit the pet regardless of
whether he's in range or not.  Nor, sadly, will bard song effects.
This latter to me is one big strike against the bard class.. they
work best buffing up full groups of combatents... but aren't
capable of providing their magic on the combatents in any
group that relies mainly on pets as tanks.  Also bad for the
pet handlers, who don't get the benefit of group buffing for
their "weapon."  Thus in the late game, where this sort of
thing is pretty common and heavily relied on, we see both
bards and pet classes less and less desired.

At any rate, yes, definately buff the pets.
