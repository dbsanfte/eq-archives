    Yeah, encounters would have been so much more interesting if melee
damage output was capped in Kunark, and caster damage output continued to
rise. Aren't you the one that thought casters were overpowered as is?

    Try motivating people to do something without tangible reward. Some
will - most won't. Hint: look at how many people are mountain climbers as a
percentage of the general population.

    Why would I use them if they weren't better in some way? Why would I
have even bothered to kill Rallos Zek? "Hey - I killed Rallos Zek!" "ROFL,
Rallos suxx0rs. N00b." Taking the "nurturing" mechanic out of a game based
entirely around it isn't the best way to run a business, is it?

    You might be surprised exactly how few people would be around. Next time
a_new_toy01 drops, suggest that it be looted by a random person as a token
that they were able to defeat such a mighty beast rather than by someone
that would use it as an upgrade. See how far that goes.
