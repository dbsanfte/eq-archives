Click the "experiment" button.

There seem to be some bugs.  My spit does not show the crafting UI.  My
research book does, as does the kiln in the Bazaar.  At first I thought
maybe it was because the book was empty but the spit was not, but putting
things in the book doesn't change things--it opens to the crafting UI and
the spit does not.

I didn't experiment much more since I had only actually logged in to cancel
my account and check prices in the Bazaar to see how the plat problems had
affected The Nameless (the expensive parts for the Earring of Solstice are
2-3 times more expensive than when I basically quit a couple months ago, the
cheaper parts are mostly 5-10 times more expensive).
