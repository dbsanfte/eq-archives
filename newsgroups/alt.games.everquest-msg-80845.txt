If you backup the Everquest directory you should be in good shape.  That 
has everything needed to play the game.

Or if you are thinking of reloading the game and repatching (takes a 
while) you should back up the .ini files, the .opt files and possibly a 
few .txt files.  The driver.txt file used to specify what video driver 
you're using, I don't know if it's used any more.  If there are others I 
hope someone will mention them.

If you don't bother to restore anything, all you're have to redo is your 
hot keys, socials, and friends list as far as I know, so you may be best 
with that if you think a configuration problem is causing your 
difficulties.

causes problems in this message, though I don't know how to turn it off :(
