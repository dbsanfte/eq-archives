No has said they existed. You are assuming a lot to assume they do.

Moreover, I didn't say four casters rounding out your group vs four 
melees rounding out your group I said - do you ever benefit greatly from 
having a druid?

No, because I've never stipulated an encounter should -require- a class, 
just benefit greatly. (e.g. encounters that a 6 man group could take 
barely, but a 3 man group could do if it has class X)

That doesn't amount to a change of *tactics* that's just an irrelevant 
absctract difference. Healing the tank 200 hits, vs preventing 200 hits, 
vs regenning 200 hits is equivalent. There's *no* tactical difference!

How do you figure? Regen and Ward you cast before the damage is taken, 
heal you cast after. Other than that the net worth is the same.

Different, but not meaninfully so.

"C'mon" is right: the "healer heals while the tank tanks...", is exactly 
ONE tactic. The fact that healers heal a little differently, and tanks 
tank a little differently doesn't change up the tactic. Tactical 
differences only come into play when you choose between different ones.

If you are fighting gating/chealing midgame mobs the presence of stuns 
can make a significant difference. A Pali is an order of magnitude more 
effective than a shadowknight, especially if the rest of the group is a 
shm, drui, & rogue.
