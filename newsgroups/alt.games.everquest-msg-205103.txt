Level makes a big difference, but, aside from that, each mob has 
different resist levels, so, no, there is no blanket answer.  I still 
find green mobs that are quite resistant, and red mobs that are trivial 
to land spells on.  Some mobs are highly resistant to certain spells 
even, such as slow.  They are not immune, but, it is almost impossible to 
stick a slow on them, yet, at the same time, I have little trouble 
sticking some other magic based spell on them, which seems to rule out 
just a general high magic resist on them.  Some mobs are just highly 
resistant or susceptible to certain types of magic, like cold, or fire, 
or poison, or disease, or pure magic based spells.
