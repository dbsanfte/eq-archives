Damn right!!! That was a BIG one of my reasons for sticking with a
human for my second character. I wanted to feel like Qeynos was my
home city, and explore all new lands for the first time. 

The first time I landed on Kunark was a blast. Where would the fun
have been if I'd seen half of it through the eyes of an Iksar
character already?
