  That's me. I logged into EQ for about five minutes last week to see if 
one particular friend was on, then logged out. She's about the only 
reason I'm keeping my account open for this long--I want to get her 
email address so I can stay in touch. (If by any chance she's reading 
this: Hey, Anette the enchanter from The Nameless! It's Atlach. Email 
me.)
  EverQuest just stopped being fun for me. I hit 57 with my necromancer 
and just kind of reached a plateau. I got tired of sitting around 
looking for groups, or trying to solo (I'm very bad at it), or grinding 
on my tradeskills. With City of Heroes, I can log in and start having 
fun almost immediately. Little moments like the following from a BBS are 
turning me into an addict:

"I was standing on a rooftop. Over on the next building, there were a 
group of about seven Circle of Thorns members doing a human sacrifice. 
(For those of you not familiar with the game, the Circle of Thorns is 
one of the NPC villain groups--evil magicians, basically.)

I was outnumbered and outgunned, but I was feeling particularly heroic 
at the moment. Taking a running start, I leapt across the gap onto the 
other rooftop...

...and proceeded to LAY THE RIGHTEOUS SMACK OF JUSTICE DOWN UPON THEIR 
COWLED HEADS.

I was kicking and stunning and jump-kicking and punching left and right, 
and they barely laid a hand on me. Afterward, their would-be NPC victim 
ran up to me and thanked me for saving her from certain death.

It was as close as I'd ever come to living a comic book moment."

I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
