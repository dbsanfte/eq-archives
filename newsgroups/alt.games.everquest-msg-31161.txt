Heh. Now that you have two characters with that name, if you EVER
don't get it on first try, a /petition wanting a family name should do
the trick (and I don't expect you to have trouble with it either)

Too bad you're not on my regular server, or I could have done it :)
Tealeef is marrying a troll of his, I take it?

Troll, dressed up? The way I see it all you can do is try to minimize
damage ;) I'd probably go with a set of blackened iron for him.

For Tealeef... You'd still look awesome in ry'gorr (As would
Teamean... female Erudite ry'gorr is spectacular) so it's a shame you
can't get it. Do you know anyone who would let you borrow some plain
tizmak leather or sell it to you cheaply? It's almost as nice as
ry'gorr and nowhere near as expensive.
If you can't get that, I think a matched set of plain leather armor
would look nicer than chain mail.

Well, you don't want an auction zone so I would count EC out. 
North Ro?
