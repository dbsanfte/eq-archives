Was at the Pixie tower last night. These pixies are easy for a level 15 to
solo for hours and collect the pixie dust. I'm level 43, and never bother
with going anon or role. As a bonus, the brownie outcasts spawn near by. The
people that know this already are all bakers, working on high level baking.

Actually had *several* people (more than 5) ask me if I was collecting pixie
dust. And then they wanted to know if I wanted the brownie parts. (picnic
baskets require chocolate too, and they're higher than pixie-cinnasticks)

While this isn't funny, it makes me long for my clue by four. Just because
I'm a necro doesn't mean I can't bake. And why yes, I can share the pixies
with you. Just not the dust *I*'m collecting.
