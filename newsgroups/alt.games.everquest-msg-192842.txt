Theres a program called eqcaster (sorry I dont have a URL) that displays the
spell info from the spell data files in your eq directory, so its always up
to date. It also displays the miscellaneous effects on weapons/armor and
clickies under the "miscellaneous" tag.

At higher levels, it takes longer to level, so you can probably expect to
come back after a few days and they will still be the same level.

Go to east karana, south of the bridge, near "reaver hill". Pull singles
down to the waters edge... you wont get adds while fighting there cos things
dont path close to the water. This is true of most zones. At 14 you should
find war wolves pretty easy, and maybe able to do some gnoll reavers. This
spot works till about lvl 19, but you would be better going to paludal
caverns before then, maybe lvl 16 or 17 in a group.
