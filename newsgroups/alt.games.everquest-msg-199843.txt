    People will route around it. "Ok, Joebob, you can't play Joebob tonight
because you have some loot from this thing." "But, I like being Joebob!"
"Doesn't matter, stupid Verant made us do this."

    We had one guild on the server that could go to the elemental planes
that was still killing mobs in Ssra. Everyone wants loot, not everyone
replaces every slot in a short period of time, and an encounter that
actually gives better loot if you're more powerful only encourages people to
bottom feed.

    Now you're talking about balancing encounters again, by comparing loot
quality versus effort required.
