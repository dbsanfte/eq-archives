In almost all circumstances, if you are rational, there are only two values
you will consider for your AA setting: 0% or 100%.  Here is why:

Suppose you set it to some value between 0 and 100, say N, and consider what
happens at some point later, when you get your next level or AA, whichever
comes first.  Let's say, for the sake of discussion, that it is an AA point
you get first, and it took you T hours, so after T hours you have earned
exactly one AA point, and you have earned a certain fraction of the way to
the next level.

If you had went 100% toward AA, you would have got the AA point in less than
time then T, and then you could have switched to 100% regular XP long enough
to reach T, and you'd then be the same fraction of the way to the next
level.  I.e., you'd be exactly at the same point you reached with you N%
setting, in exacly the same time--the difference is that if you go N% you
don't get the AA point until the end of that, whereas going 100% AA then
100% regular XP gets you the AA point sooner.

So, ask yourself this: what do I want to reach next?  My next AA point, or
some specific level goal (or partial level goal--such as getting enough XP
into the level to take a death without losing a level)?  If the next goal
you want to reach is an AA point, go 100% AA.  If the next goal is dinging,
or reaching a safety point, go 100% regular XP.  Whenever you reach the
goal, ask yourself this question again.
