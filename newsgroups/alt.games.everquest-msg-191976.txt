I thought they used Minor Illusion to do the actual purchase?  Ah well,
no matter, it's all part of their nefarious plot...  First they change
up the trade skills so that it's lots harder to get them up to high
levels, now they make it so new Enchanters can't get their mana
distillation spells, next they'll no doubt make it so that at least one
ingredient in every recipe that allows non-wealthy characters to
skill-up will become ultra rare, then when that doesn't work they'll
just change it so you can't raise any tradeskill higher than your
lowest stat....  If you aren't one of the first on the block you might
as well just bend over and spread 'em, that's the SOE way, always has
been, always will be.
