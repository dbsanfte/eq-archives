I play a 54 Monk. In my view only three things really matter to a monk. AC,
Hp's and Str. Ac for obvious reasons. Hp's because even at level 54 I get 25
hp's per level. That really sucks for hp's. So I use as many AC/Hp items I
can get. The Ac 6 65 hp rings are among the best monk item. Any items where
you can stack hp's are useful. Str is important because this raises your
attack, and monks are a damage dealing class. Velium Chipped Amulet is also
good Ac 4 Str 4 , hp's 30 combining all three of these categories. Most
Monks still wear Azure Sleeves at 60 since they still have the highest AC in
the game for a sleeve slot (as far as I know), as well as low weight.
Gatorscale Leggings are a good choice Ac 7 and 15 hp's. One can camp for
these with a group in 30's. Also do the Gem Inlaid gauntlent quest this will
cost you no money. Go to Paw in SK and get into a gnoll group collect all 4
scrolls and do the quest (might be tough for an Iksar tho do to faction)
Gaunts are Ac 8, dex 3 sta 3. Orc Fang earrings are fine and are down to
around 50 pp's on Emarr. These are very cheap for the stats. Pre-Velious
Diamondine earrings were around 1k ea, and the Orc Fang has better stats.
The only other thing to note os in some instances esp. post 50 once has to
sac some Ac and hp's for resists, like on a dragon raid for example.
Hope that helps.
Young
54 Monk Emarr.
