Hmm, he didn't do much in the way of buffing actually.  OTOH, he showed
a good touch with his heals and I quickly grew comfortable relying on
him to keep me clear of death's door.  That, to me, is _the_ requirement
for any healer (I know, "well, duh!") and the rest is gravy.

Heh, skill I'm a bit deficient in.  But when everybody knows their roles
it's not too hard.  And I've learned to enjoy pull-tanking in LDoN, so
once I'd gotten the group together and called the loot rules I was soon
doing the same things I've been doing in nearly all of my groups lately.
