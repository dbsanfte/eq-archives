I didn't quite like the female gnome plate look. But gnome ry'gorr is
pretty :) There's plenty small sized armor out there, even the hero
bracer which dwarves can't wear. Basically, what you're missing out on
by being agnostic is the Brell dwarven cultural armor - I don't think
gnomes can wear human field plate - and there is plenty comparable
gear that doesn't need religion.

Ever had an ogre try to eat you? Seems to be the standard gnome/ogre
thing.

Gotta love that :)

I wouldn't be surprised. Comparing the melee skill increases of my
wood elf warrior with those of my dark elf shadow knight or even my
gnome mage is downright disheartening :) (The mage meleed a lot until
level 4 and made faster progress in 1hb and piercing than both the
tanks at those levels.)
