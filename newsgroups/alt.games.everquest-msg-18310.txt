My current macros:

Name: INC (Red text)

/g INCOMING: %t. Brace for combat!

Name: LOC

/doability 1 (sense heading)
/pause 25, /loc
/doability 1 (sense heading)
/loc

This one is particularly nice because it trains up Sense Heading and allows 
me to get two coordinates 2.5 seconds apart when I am running... That means 
I can get my heading a lot easier and better. I keep it mapped to key 0. 
It's a nice thing to do right before you die in an unexplored region.

I also have a host of pet commands like

%O! Go forth and slay %T!
/pet kill

and stuff like that. It's nice because others around you know what 
directives you are giving your pet.
