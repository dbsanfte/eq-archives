Yeah, I asked about this earlier and did some research and the resounding
answer I received was consistent: the amount of experience it takes to get a
single AA point is fixed at the amount of experience points that it takes to
move you from level 51 to 52, and this will be true whether you are 51 or
65. It should therefore be obvious that as you rise up each level it will
take less relative effort to achieve an AA point. At your current level the
amount of experience required is equal to that required to gain a whole new
level. At level 64 it will be some small percentage of the experience
required to go to 65.

If you're trying to stay within range of friends who are lagging behind,
getting AA xp is a good way to manage your experience. But all other things
being equal, it seems to make far more sense to gain levels now and AA
points later when they are relatively easier to come by.
