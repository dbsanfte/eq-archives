Hey guys. I have EQ2 installed but I'm going to remain busy at present 
playing EQ1 and trying out AO for a least a while. But I've been curious 
as to what I can expect in terms of performance and graphics detail with 
the system I have now which I am not sure can even be considered 
midrange anymore. It runs EQ1 beautifully though, except for the new 
shadows which I tried but immediately turned back off.

My system is consists of the following:

HP Pavilion 540n
Pentium 4 2.2 GHz Northwood
ASUS motherboard
SiS650 chipset
512 MB PC2100 DDR RAM
Nvidia GeForce FX 5600 w/ 256 MB RAM
120 GB Western Digital HD 7200 RPM 8 MB cache
80 GB Maxtor HD 7200 RPM 2 MB cache
HP CD-Writer cd16f 16x8x40x
Lucent Winmodem
SB Live 5.1
SiS 900 PCI Fast ethernet
NEC Multisync FE990 19" flat screen monitor
MS Intellimouse (PS/2 mouse)
Motorola Cable modem

I am planning to add a 1 gig stick of PC2100 DDR RAM right after 
Christmas which I priced at about 200 for name brand RAM. I did have 
another 512 MB generic stick in there, which really didn't make much 
difference running EQ1 except to cause frequent crashes when zoning and 
going back to character select or camping out. As far as I can tell, 
that stick of RAM was bad and I don't think I'll ever cheap out with 
generic RAM again. I ran what I consider to be a half baked memory test 
on it and the system crashed every time the test ran. I know to be 
thorough I should have run memtest or something like it without windows 
loaded but I couldn't be bothered and that takes a long time. So I just 
pulled the RAM and went back down to 512 MB. All crash problems 
dissapeared after doing so.

I am hoping that while the Nvidia FX 5600 is at best a midrange card, 
that the 256 MB RAM on it will come into play in improving performance 
with EQ2 and perhaps allow a little higher level of detail. I do plan a 
complete system replacement but that's not happening until Summertime 
most likely. I don't really even want to blow 200 bucks on RAM for this 
system now but I guess it's going to be worth it for the six months or 
so I get use out of it and I suspect it will have a major impact on 
performance for what I have to work with.

A little off topic but I am planning to try WoW too at some point 
upcoming. I've heard that it is not as hardware intensive as EQ2. Anyone 
with some experience have a feel for how it might run on my current 
configuration and how much difference the addition gig of RAM might make 
for that game. I'll have 1.5 gig total RAM at that point.

Any feedback would be most appreciated as I am curious but don't have 
time for EQ2 right now.
