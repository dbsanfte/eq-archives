 50 Iksar monk (2 yellows to 51) ... I Have Silver Chitin Hand Wraps
for haste and Adamantite club and Stave of Shielding for weapons...
and rest of my gear is pretty decent (AC 920 HP 1600  unbuffed).

I have hunted Sol B and DL solo....... DL is starting to suck (well
more than normal... lot of lt blues floating)  Sol B is either ltblue
or appers to be too difficult for me and my gear (bugs and bats kick
my ass).

any ideas or recommendations for this lil boy.

I have done a little duo with a 51 druid in Burned Woods ( its next to
Steamfont this week)... that was awesome exp, but my druid friend is
not always around.


as usual your time and insight are appreciate.
