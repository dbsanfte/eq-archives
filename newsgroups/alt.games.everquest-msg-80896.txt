Last night, I had some time to kill, so I was soloing in LOIO.  I had almost
three yellow bubbles, and full blue bubbles.  One more kill to hit three
yellow bubbles, great, I'll go kill something then log so I can come back
tomorrow and ding.

Sit down and med to full (JIC), Radar On, cool...a Blue Sarnak
Conscript...that should do it...root, DOT, DD, you knnow the drill.  He
dies, I check my XP, and BAM...I'm sitting at TWO yellow bubbles.  How does
this happen?

I've had it happen once before, and said nothing, but a full yellow bubble
isn't exactly quick to get.  Is this a bug?

Thanks for your input,
