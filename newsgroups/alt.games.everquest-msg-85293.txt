OMG guys, chill!!  I think this fella might have over-reacted, and he
admitted to as much.  But I think the abuse he's received in this
thread is way out of proportion.  I mean, remember that he was PL'ing
two total strangers, trying to *help* them.  He wasn't doing it for
his own alts or even for his guild or something.  As far as his
response to he other group, he felt he was protecting the right of
*these two total strangers*.  I mean, at the least give him credit for
trying to do the right thing.  The lvl of abuse I've seen on this
thread makes me think there's more than one person who overreated
here.
