Heh that would be stupid if people got punished for innovative use of
spells that verant puts in the game themselves. That's like saying,
"Hey! Dammit, no go the other way. We don't care what you want, go
through the big long fight we planned for you to or we'll erase all
your accounts!". I can just see the picture in my mind of some big fat
ass loser with a pony tail GMing his 1000th pencil and paper RPG
whining about something like that and threatening to take all his
compendiums and go home. If it's in the game you should be allowed to
do it, continued use of a bug or exploit is solely the fault of the
game's programmers for not fixing it immediately.
