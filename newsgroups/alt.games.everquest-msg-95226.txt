I agree on the first part but not the 2nd part.
He contributed to getting the mage killed, especially nowadays when you can see a afk
over their head.  You should tread carefully around a person that has afk up.
This from seeing way to many people who see someone afk and have a train then run
right over that person in hopes that they will act as a magnet for their train.

I have a 53 mage mysel and have gone aft a few times with my pet to protect me at
some static spawn. I should feel comfortable in thinking that I am reasonably safe.
Don't need some dipstick running by and dragging other mobs with him.
