Actually, I have a lvl 8 enchanter, a level 4 bard, and an infant Shadowknight.
I'm just not playing them currently. I want to play all the classes, but I also
want to get at least one character up towards the endgame to have that
experience and see what things look like from that level. After playing a
cleric, monk, wizard, and warrior up into the 20's, I've decided that the
warrior is the one I want to try to make it to 50 with first.

Agreed. See above.

30 as of last night, but I think the difference is minimal compared to the
skills and knowledge I'll need in the 50's so the point if moot. *shrug*

You've already sold me on that.

That must be another post 30 thing. My wizzie is 24 and permanently retired. (Or
at least until I have a 50th level to twink him to hell far beyond his level. I
hate the character with a passion and now only use him to travel around for
guild meetings and such. Maybe wizards get easier later on, but that was 180
degrees off from my experience in the "warrior vs. wizard" choice.

I plan on. Probably by the summer or fall. Right now I'm just enjoying bashing
stuff and getting in good groups all the time. ;-)

I fully agree that you're qualified to make those statements, and it's been very
educational, Dan. Thanks for the help.
