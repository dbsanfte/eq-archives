Yup. It's not something that negatively impacts my play experience
until someone else makes an concious decision to exploit said safe
spot (And even then, only as a minor annoyance). At that point, the
easier solution is for a GM/Guide to give said exploiter a slap on the
wrist, after which those who didn't realize they were doing something
wrong are educated and don't repeat the incident usually. Those who
repeatedly exploit safe spots are removed either temporarily or
permanently from the game. Much easier than re-working the pathing of
the entire zone to cover one tiny little dead spot, which could
possibly require re-sending the zone file to the players. A bit too
much trouble for a problem that really isn't that big of a deal to
work around until something else comes up where the zone will need to
be patched anyway.
