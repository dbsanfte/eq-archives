Thanks! There's lots to do now that I no longer have to think about 
attaining new levels or spells. Things on my to-do list:

1)  Continue building Veritas into the guild we've envisioned. We just hit 
guild level 20, which I believe places us in the top 10 on the server, so we 
have a good, dedicated player base. We have an active raiding schedule to 
pursue and many recruits to bring through the system and get prepared for 
the big raids ahead. There are dragons to conquer, prismatic weapons to 
acquire, new mysteries to solve (e.g., the plague) and much existing content 
that we've still yet to see. Building a raid-ready guild *starts* by 
building a player base of adequately experienced and geared up players and 
we're well on the way toward that goal, but with much more to do. Mentoring 
will allow me to start helping others in the guild level up by giving them 
the experience I no longer need.

2) Getting my wife leveled up to my level. She's not on as often but is high 
enough to still get experience with me without mentoring, so with mentoring 
she ought to rise pretty fast.

3) Hitting level 50 in Alchemy. I started off strong in crafting but left it 
behind once I started full-time adventuring. Now that this is done I can 
resume where I left off. I'll hit L30 Alchemy tonight and will push on to 50 
so that I can start making and imbuing the materials needed for some of the 
great player crafted items in Tier 5.

4) Now that I know my spells are fixed for a while, I can focus on upgrading 
all of them to Adept III to make me more effective in my role.

5) Complete the remaining Heritage quests that are still pending. I've 
completed 18 of them, and have 4 pending (which I believe is all that there 
are currently in the game). There's a new title available after hitting 20 
Heritage, "the Relic Keeper". I'll probably do the Eyepatch and BBC next to 
hit that title.

6) There's a lot more content I've yet to see. I've never raided Vox or 
Venekor, nor even seen Nagafen. I haven't yet started the infamous Deception 
quest and there are many Access quests I'd like to get accomplished (e.g., 
Heart of Fear).

There is plenty to do now!
