EverQuest Engine Upgrade Notice     
       
Sony Online Entertainment has exciting news for all EverQuest 
players. As the world of Norrath evolves and expands, so too 
does the technology powering EverQuest. Sony Online Entertainment 
is making significant upgrades to the EverQuest engine which will 
allow SOE to provide players with the great game, but on a much 
more stable and efficient platform. SOE anticipates patching in 
the new engine sometime during the next month or two.

Part of this change will result in the need for all EverQuest 
players to upgrade to DirectX 9 (DX9), the latest version of 
Microsoft's 3D software. As best as SOE can determine, a very 
small percentage of our current EverQuest player base (less 
than 1%) may find that their older video cards are not compliant 
with DX9. To find out if a video card is DX9 compliant, players 
should check with the manufacturer of their card (video drivers 
may need to be updated as well). Players can also consult the 
EverQuest tech page on Sony Online Entertainment's website, 
located at http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support.jsp. 

Sony Online Entertainment is very concerned that even a small 
number of our players may have issues running EverQuest. To 
address this, SOE has worked out a deal with NVIDIA and eVGA.com 
to provide current EQ players access to discounts on a number of 
newer video cards that are DX9 compliant. eVGA.com will be 
offering EQ players discounts on several PC video cards that 
utilize Nvidia technology, from the affordable GeForce FX 5600XT 
all the way up to the GeForce FX 5900 Ultra. Current EverQuest 
players can go to http://www.evga.com/eq/ to take advantage of 
this special offer.
