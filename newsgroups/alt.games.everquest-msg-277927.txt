I've been following this discussion a bit because I was debating
trying out EQ2 this summer, at least I was before this announcement. 

A friend of mine that plays EQ2 basically told me the same thing that
you posted above but it makes no sense. From SOE's perspective, they
can't make any money off of this if they just keep it on a select few
servers. Mainly because there's no way that even a significant
minority of the players that want to buy items will switch to these
servers. There's no real incentive for either the buyers or sellers to
move. 

Reading Smed's original post on the subject with that in mind, I'm
convinced that they are(were) planning to roll this out on a majority
of the servers before the end of the year. There's just no reason  for
SOE to even bring this up otherwise and Smed's double-talk in his
original post also seems to point in that direction. 

Hopefully, there will be enough of an outcry raised by the player base
that this won't happen but I'm absolutely convinced that this was
SOE's plan from the beginning. Either way, it pretty much kills EQ2
for me until this is resolved. 

... so how's the oringinal EQ doing these days? <g>

Rgds, Frank
