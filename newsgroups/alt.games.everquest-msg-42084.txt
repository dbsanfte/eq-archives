So much for, "There is no AC."
:-)
After a miraculous piece of luck, finding the AC uncamped in OoT for the
second straight day, we settled in for yet another aggrivating session.
But this time, after about six hours, the AC finally spawned. Unlike
dealing with all the KSing bastards in SRo that you hear horror stories
about, we had no problems with others, took down the AC and I got my
ring. Though it was already kind of late, we decided to stick it out a
bit longer and try for a seocond one for the cleric. Sure enough, less
than two hours later, AC spawns again, we bag the ring, and camp out.
  Now, Jboots questions: In the past, when I've hailed hastrom in Rathe,
he responds with some little Yoda Jedi speech, but there was no
[bracketed text] as I recall. Do you *have to* talk to him, and if so,
what is the correct response? Or can you just hand him the three items?
  Next, does he despawn after doing the quest once? If so, any idea of
his respawn time?
  Last, if he's not up, or despawns, I've seen some other stuff running
that route which I assume are PH's for hastrom. One was a drake, no
problem there. But I believe the other was some monk quest NPC, red to
lvl 50 friends, and I understand he'd take an army to take down. What's
a good way to make sure two people can do the quest in one trip?
TIA
