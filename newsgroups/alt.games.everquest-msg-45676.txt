That oak bark is a pain in the ass. I get quite a bit of morning dew
every time I hit Gfay, but every piece of bark that I have has been
given me by an iksar friend who picked it up while crossing Warslilks.
I spent some time in kithicor last night chasing Giz around, and the
only rare thing I foraged was a root.

How much do you charge for the boots? I'm planning on making them
soon... my tailoring is 90, and I am currently working up my smithing/
trying to collect crystalline silk. I have all my alts collecting cat
pelts and silk for quivers and future Wu's, and got a few stacks of
silk from my time in Dreadlands. I have 26 days played, level 52,
brewing 167, baking 143, pottery 130, tailoring 90, smithing 83,
fishing 71 (if I med near water, I break out the pole). Oh, and
fletching and jewelcraft 21 - I suspect I'll be stocking up on
materials and working on those two skills in Kithicor, trying to
forage oak bark :) (That, or pharm greens in Warslilks..)
