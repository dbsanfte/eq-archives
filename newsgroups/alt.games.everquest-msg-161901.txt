As has been stated many many times by people answering similar questions,
play what is fun.  Personally if you want to play a great character, you'll
have to decide what that is.  I think iksar shamans are better then barbs
simply because of innate regen coupled with canni = uber.  At lower levels
shamans aren't as useful in groups it seems because they don't have snare
and there more powerful attacks are dots, but later on, their slows, speed,
buffs, pet, make them extremely powerful.  That's just my feelings on the
matter.  Play what fits your persona.
