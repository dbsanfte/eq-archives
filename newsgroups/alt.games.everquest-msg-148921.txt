While it would be nice at times to have certain character types i think 
it would spoil things if they did this.
The whole satisfaction for me with this game is seeing the progression i 
have made.
It wouldnt feel right to start the game with a high level character and 
to never have gone through the hard times when i had nothing.
The first 12 levels were hell for my wizard and i got sick of the 
travelling for cr and so on.
At 12 i got bind affinity so it wasnt as bad then.
But i loved the fact i was seeing my character improve.
If they sell pre-skilled characters it would be like switching on the 
cheat mode in some other games.
I think it would disrupt game balance too something Sony seem to want to 
keep to so i cant see them ever doing this.
And it definately could not be done on Pvp server.
Level 20 character kills level 18 character so level 18 character goes 
and buys a lvel 30 character and kicks his ass so the other guy goes and 
buys a etc etc, you get the picture
