It's called a Fungi. A bit more (ok, a lot more :p) up-front cost but
at least you don't have to refresh it every 3 hours or after you die.
Given the good cheap weapons and armor out there these days, I doubt
any caster can beat a fungified melee when it comes to leveling speed,
at least up to 50th lvl. Fungi also has the advantage that you don't
acually waste money on it, you can always sell it and get your money
back. ...or loan it out to your friends, give it to another twink.
