The new patcher uses HTTP requests to communicate with the patch
server.  A *lot* of HTTP requests.  If you are using the Guidescope ad
filtering proxy, you might find that things are not happy.  Here's
what I was seeing:

1. The EQ patcher would take a long time to get to the new interface.

2. It would take 10-15 minutes for the file check.

3. During this time, CPU usage was so high that I couldn't do anything
else.  E.g., if I try to type in another window, it is 30 seconds or
more for each character to echo.  This is on Win Me on a 900 MHZ
Athlon.

Watching all this with Filemon show that there are a huge number of
accesses to some of Guidescope's files during this, so I went and
disabled Guidescope in my IE settings, and then the new EQ patcher
worked almost as well as the old one (still not quite as fast, but
acceptable).

I've sent a note to Verant about this, suggesting that they add a way
in the new patcher to tell it not to use your browser proxy settings.
