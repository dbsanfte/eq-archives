The socialist comment refers not to the position on the middle east, but the
inherent distrust of the market, and for-profit agencies.  His belief that
the profit motive automatically corrupts shows a socialst point of view,
while my belief that the market creates accountability shows a capitalist
point of view.  Which one's right?  Well, you know my answer.

As a whole, though, the tendancy will be towards a centrist view.  Piss the
people on the left off, they stop watching, piss the people on the right
off, they stop watching.  If you're centrist, you may get under the skin of
some people, but not to the extent that they write you off as a flaming
idiot.  I think the nation, as a whole, is smart enough to see the bias,
when there is an alternative to compare it to.  That makes an unbiased or
balanced approach the best route, financially.

Acutally, unbiased is not in the eye of the beholder, that's exactly what
makes it unbiased.  ^__^  Do some people see bias where there is none?
Sure, just as some ignore bias where it's blatent.  Either way, they're
wrong.
