HO benefits aren't just raw damage, though.  There's health
and power regen, for instance.  Power regen in particular
can be more than worth the wait.   And, just for the record,
a 20 second HO would either have some very slow players
or lots of fizzles/resists tied in.

All I know from practical experience is HOs dramatically
cut kill time and down time for a group.   *shrug*

Right.  Triggering another HO while the initial HO symbol is up
ends the first HO.   Doing a special attack out-of-order ends
an HO (for the sequence ones, of course, the random ones
obviously don't care about sequence.)   Other than that, people
can attack as they normally would, at least as far as I can tell.
