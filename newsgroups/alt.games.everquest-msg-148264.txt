    If there was a consistent way that NPCs fought, the point would be
stronger. As it is, there's no clear guidelines on how tough an NPC should
be at a given level. Which one of Vindi/Statue cons blue, again? Compare
that mob with the cakewalk that is Emperor Chottal.

    I agree with you, don't get me wrong. But I can see how players could
get upset whenever anything "good" is nerfed.

    Yes, they mean for you to GROUP to kill these mobs. You know, GROUP -
multiple players working towards a common goal? The whole point of the
enhanced XP for high-level mobs was so that GROUP XP would be better than
solo XP. The wizards in Dawnshroud were quadding (!) level 60 mobs and
making AA points as fast, if not faster than an AoE group.

    Balance means no free rides.

    Things that are too hard don't cause balance issues, because nobody gets
a free ride compared to anyone else by doing those camps. It only causes
crowding issues, as people flock like sheep to the easiest possible camps
for given reward levels.
