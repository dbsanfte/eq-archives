i noticed this when we went into Befallen with our twinks a couple of weeks
ago, been a long time since i had been charmed

when you are charmed, it puts a LD mark on your name, but you are still in
the group.  you cannot communicate with anyone.  my best guess is this is
one of those stealth "improvements"  (as opposed to nerfs) that VI put in so
you can tell your partner has been charmed.

LD and still in group = charm - root the poor sob quick
