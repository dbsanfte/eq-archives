  Sure.  Disabling alt-tab functionality adds only a pseudo layer of security.
It might as well not even be there, since  programs like EQW are readily
available that allow you to scoot right around the supposed security provided by
disabling alt-tab.

  People who are going to use alt-tab "illegitimately" will do so regardless of
whether or not the feature is supported officially in EQ.  Putting in the
limitation only frustrates the vast majority of players who want to use it for
legitimate purposes.

  I doubt if lifting the alt-tab restriction would result in a huge upsurge in
script kiddie EQ haxors... if somebody has the expertise and inclination to
create an EQ speed/vision/whatever hack, they probably have the ability to
create a hack around the alt-tab restriction.

  Besides, moron chat kids are just that.  The majority of them would probably
get caught red-handed anyhow, and that'd be one less person with a cheater's
mentality that we'd have to deal with in game.
