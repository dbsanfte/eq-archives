At the moment you'll be able to wear the non-imbued, normal Ogre War Plate, 
which is interesting but not all that great.  Just this past patch or two 
they installed enchanted-imbued versions of OWP, but not just enchanted 
OWP, which means us agnostic Ogre Warriors are out of luck.  Too bad, I 
chose agnostic before they put in the big blacksmithing revision, and I was 
up to 20 before the cultural stuff hit.  Too late to start all over.

Ogre and Troll Warriors, please choose Rallos Zek as your diety!  That 
imbued-enchanted stuff is REALLY nice!
