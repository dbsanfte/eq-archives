Why would an *uber geared tank* not be able to hit or get agro unless he was
power leveled, ebayed, or clueless?  At 26 I could see not knowing all the
nuances of playing your character, and that's exactly why it doesn't hurt to
advise people of how to play more efficiently and effectively, (which I said,
and you snipped).
When my ranger wanted to learn a new weapon skill she put it in her off hand,
or she used it when the mob was running away, both usually.  I wouldn't join a
group of mid twenties and insist on being MT using a 1HB weapon if my skill
level was *2*. 
To join a group of strangers and insist on being MT when you can't hit or hold
agro?  That makes no sense!  Let someone else be MT and practice your new
weapon skills all you like!  I didn't say throw the guy out, I said let the
more capable person be MT, (you snipped that too).
