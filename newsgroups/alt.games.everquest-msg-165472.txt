I learned it the same way, find the fastest delay, screw the damage and
ratio until you are trained.

If you learned it whiffing away with a 44 damage 60 delay Ogguk Cleaver,
just because it had the "best ratio" from what you could buy... then you're
an idiot.

The 3/19.  Any day of the week.

Not only will it train up almost twice as fast (especially once dual wield
kicks in) it'll also keep the mobs alive for more swings.  More swings =
more skill up chances.

Once you've maxed out the skill, then you can start looking for damage
weapons (or better yet, switch to slashing which has more mid-level choices
for him.)
