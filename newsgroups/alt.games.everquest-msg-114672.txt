I think that I got lucky with my Undamaged pelt.
I got it after about 70 rat kills.
Remember that the pelts are drop-able, so it is worth auctioning and
checking merchants (if the servers stay up long enough).
All the druid stuf does drop (I have a full suit) and the mobs are not
*that* rare. Some of the other classes have it harder.

They are OK util they go a-wandering.
I have seen those two guards prity much repop the whole tope end of the
zone when they went a-walking.
I remember zoning in from Runeeye once and seeing one of the guards
taking down Mooto (SP) and his chums.
A bit annoying I will agree.
