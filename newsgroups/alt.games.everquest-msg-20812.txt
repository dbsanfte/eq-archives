when you are 8th level, and you walk past the undead mound, with two lesser
mummies where there are normally decayed or normal skellies, and run into to
gobbo alchemists, wandering from the goblin camp towards one of the orc
camps, where there are usually the odd goblin warrior, and you end up
running back to the guards because they have all agroed on the only
character within a game mile or so, friend, at that point the zone feels
pretty full of hard mobs.
