  Well, the system requirements page really seems to suggest that you have a
video card with hardware T&L, saying you "might be" okay if you don't have
hardware T&L but you do have a faster processor, like a Pentium III or an
Athlon.  I would not expect very good performance in Luclin or with the new
character models on with your current graphics card, though we'll have to
see.  I have little doubt it'll be playable, but I predict you'll have to
turn down the clipping plane, tone down particle effects and you still will
probably experience laggy framerates in at least some circumstances.

  You would probably benefit a lot from a $100 graphics card upgrade, but
otherwise your system seems relatively well suited to Luclin.
