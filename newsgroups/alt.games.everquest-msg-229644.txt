First thing I noticed when I started my mage was about 8 corpses of
some guy that had apparently attacked his guildmaster over and over. 
You will get more food, water, bags, and pet weapons (?) than you will
know what to do with that way I guess.  Also, handing in your newbie
note gives you a little experience.  Sacrifice about 10 times and I
expect you could start out on level 2 when you decide.

I have never PKed someone.  Are you unable to open bags on corpses, (I
assume this is true)?  If so this may be the best way to preserve
wealth...Get familiar with the jewelry merchants and visit them often.

Possible his own inventory was full, being on a PK run?  Plus you are
probably in a hurry to get out of Dodge.  Looting a corpse can give
someone a free shot at you.

Why a Warrior anyway?  You planning on joining a guild?  Warriors must
be one of the worst PK classes in the game.
