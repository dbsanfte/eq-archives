I had this problem when I used MS's Internet Connection Sharing.  I
did some research and found out the some of the ports requried to run
EQ are closed by default w/ ICS. That is ok but there is no way to
open the ports with the standard MS software.  There is a program out
there that will let you open the ports but the name of it escapes me.

I have switched over to a hardware based router
(http://www.freesco.com) and haven't had the problem since.
