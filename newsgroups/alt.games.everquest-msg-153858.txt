As a SK, I can say that pulling is rather situational. Around casters, I
think a SK is a better choice for a puller - mainly since SKs have more HPs
than Monks so we can get nuked more and still stay on our feet.

On the other hand, I still think Monks would be better pullers around pure
melee type mobs. Monks don't have to rely on channeling a spell through
while getting their ass handed to them by several seriously pissed off mobs.
For Monks, they only have the small gamble of FD failing. Monks also have
the benefit to heal themself when down... it's only a little health, but
when you're working your way back to camp any little bit counts.

If Shadow Knights could Root, -then- I think Monks would be in serious
trouble. Being able to separate a few mobs using Root to initiate social
aggro, then selectively Rooting the other to limit how many mobs come at
once would be a Monk-class-killer.

Of course, that's hypothetical since SKs can't Root, and it would only work
in some situations anyhow.

I really don't see SKs replacing Monks as pullers. SKs are fine pullers, but
Monks really are superior in many cases.

Heh, of course this is going on the type of Monk I know now... it's hard to
predict exactly what will happen to Monks once they get beaten around by the
nerf bat.

Bluntly, I think this is a ridiculous nerf for Monks. Sure, I can see the
sense of realism that is added to the game by making Monks even more squishy
than before due to their lack of armour... however, in a game with magic,
odd races, and gods, isn't there just a little bit of assumed creative
license?

If the game was based entirely on the realistic nature that is nerfing Monk
damage mitigation, shouldn't fists do nearly no damage at all? Swords can
do -a lot- more damage than fists, after all.

Sorry Monks... I gave Verant yet another excuse for them to nerf you. :b
