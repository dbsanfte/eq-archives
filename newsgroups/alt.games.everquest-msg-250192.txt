Yes it would have been nice, but it's not as if it was on their agenda
for this particular meeting, so it's pointless crying about it. They have
a titload of stuff from ALL classes and levels, and they say they're
going to work their way round to it. Weather you agree that starting
their discussions with the players who the expansions that brought
the problems (GoD) and are being boycotted (OOW) are aimed at
is a good idea or not, it would be business suicide to then go on to
ignore the group of people they concede are the majority of their
customers, so I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt at
least.

*sigh* Why is it the moment you trust SOE, or agree with them
you are automatically an apologist, an employee or a fanboi? I've
explained my motivation for arguing this side of the coin so I'll not
repeat it just because you don't get it, but I will say that "helping"
at the moment... well I would be more inclined to think that
responding to their call for suggestions with actual suggestions
is "helping" more than turning down the olive branch and kicking
them till they just don't feel EQ is worth running any more, thanks.

Fair enough, but irrelevent to the conversation you quoted. Nowhere
did I say I thought that SOE were going to stop pushing buggy code
live, I was just replying to the accusation that they're not prioritising
the DX9 bugs, which by all accounts they are doing (OK, the
accounts of people who've been in to see them working on it, rather
than the accounts of people who assume that because they've found
a bug SOE aren't working on them).
