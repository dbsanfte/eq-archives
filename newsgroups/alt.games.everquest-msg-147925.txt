I hear that humans were supposed to get the bonus, but it went
to halflings by mistake, and they were unwilling to alienate
the player base by changing it.

As rumors go, this is weak, since they certainly have been
happy to nerf and (buff?) classes quite at a whim since
release...

But the fact that humans are clearly the weakest race
in the game, while halflings have numberous advantages,
does lend an air of credibility to the idea.
