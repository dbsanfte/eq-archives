It may not be at all.  I've joined a group that was waiting on one *friend*.  I
do a /who all Player and he's in the bazaar.  5 minutes later he's in POK.  10
minutes later he's still in POK - something important.  10 minutes later he's
getting a KEI, then he'll be down.  10 minutes later he shows up.  We get our
mission and down to the zone in point and guess what?  He forgot food, water,
or arrows.  Or tiny daggers.  
I'll admit my patience has been worn pretty thin by some of the nonsense that
goes on *before*  a group even gets started.
Continuing vent way off subject now to the *end* of the mission....
The ML last night gated out to go sell.  Several mapless people got lost
getting back to the zone out point so it took us several minutes to get out. 
Then because the ML was also the sower we all had to hoof it back to BB the
slow way.  Now you'd think in that amount of time the ML would be waiting for
us when we got there, right?  No.  She's in POK when we finallly get to BB.  We
sit around for at *least* five more minutes before she shows up in the zone and
splits.  No explanation, no *sorry for the wait*, nothing.
I hate to add these kind of people to my /ignore list.  I need a /frustrating
people list too.
