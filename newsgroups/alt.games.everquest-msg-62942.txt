In some cases people may have been selling unopened editions say of
velious, since a lot of people were out of velious in their area as
was the verant store. Its kind of like profiteering. Buyer beware
since you don't know if they've used the reg, but really anything on
ebay is buyer beware.

Now though, both a velious for $14.99 and a kunark for $14.99 mini box
editions are availitble from the sony station store.
