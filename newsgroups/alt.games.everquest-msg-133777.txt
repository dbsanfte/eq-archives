While the FT drop item and the POTC earring are both arguably easier
to get than the seventh shawl, this isn't an either/or thing.  FT items stack
till you get to a cap (25 I think) so every FT item you get is going to
make your mana regen that much better.

Since POTC and shawl quests both take trade skills to make, this
doubles the impetus for every caster to stop ignoring trade skills
as worthless, an investment in trade skills can now pay off in faster
mana regen, which is the best of all self improvement projects for
any caster/healer class character.

Of course if he's already got FT24 and thus only room for one more
FT item, I suppose I'd argue that the FT drop item would be far
easier to get than the shawl or for that matter the earring.  Isn't the
FT item dropping in CT FT 3, anyway?
