If I may suggest, take a look at www.your-site.com, which is where my
domain is hosted.

They are a very inexpensive hosting service ($5-7 a month), and will
also register your domain for you through one of the new registrars
(as opposed to through Network Solutions), which will also save you
money. 

As an added bonus, you can even set up private e-mail boxes for your
guild members if you wish.
