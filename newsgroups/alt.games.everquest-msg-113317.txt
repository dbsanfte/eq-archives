Couldnt agree more.

Lets see, what reasons for now answering a sow request:
In tell hell.
Talking to guildies
Doing tradeskils
Reading maps to see where to go (had a guy beg me for a port 5 times in 
EJ while i was looking at my map).
Watching TV
Being on the phone
Doing the dishes
Cleaning the house
On the bathroom
Ignoring sow beggar XXXXX in the last hour

See, lots of reasons for not answering. Personally when i sit in NFP to 
sell, i can do something else like watch TV. Am right next to the 
computer and check it a lot to see if anyone wanna buy my stuff, but i 
dont exactly have time to say no those 15 sow/port/buffs/DS begs i get 
while i watch a 30 min tv show.
Or running from WC to NFP i usually take bathroom breaks as soon as i 
have started running in EC, since im then in WFP when im done.
