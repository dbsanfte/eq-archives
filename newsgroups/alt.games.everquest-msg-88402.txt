No one can be told what Everquest is, you have to see it for yourself.
(or however that quote goes)

Seriously, you've bought the game, just play it and judge for yourself. If
you are are familiar with the tabletop game, Dungeons and Dragons, then
character creation will be pretty famliar to you, or at least races and
classes will be.
As for game play, yep hack n' slash pretty much sums it up, the same as
someone here once described Quake as "strafe, strafe, strafe, shoot." It's
what you want to put into the game that makes it enjoyable.
