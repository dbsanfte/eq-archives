On my server, the situation is slightly different in that they are long
established rotations with many guilds in them.  This is a case of an
agreement between 3 guilds.  Beyond that, I did not think then, nor do I now
think that the rotations are fair, despite the fact that my guild did get
into both rotations by the rules.

I do agree it's pretty shitty of the other guilds to not come to some
reasonable agreement regarding PoE, but, do have trouble with the insistence
that only the individual guilds be allowed to try killing RZ.
