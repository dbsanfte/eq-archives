I use an Athalon 1600XP at present without any zone crashes or desktop
boots. A friend was getting boots to desktop with an Athalon system. I
enquired as to whether he had updated the VIA chipset drivers on his
motherboard. His reply was "WTF you on about?". After pointing him to
http://www.viaarena.com/?PageID=2 he download the latest VIA drivers,
installed and has had no problems since. I don't know if you have a VIA
chipset but I have found most Athalon based motherboards are.

Try that.
