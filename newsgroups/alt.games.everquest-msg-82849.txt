I get the impression of him sitting at a fold down table with a glazed
look in his eyes and answering every question "There is no secondary
skill for Jewelry" with a huge line of people queuing up to ask him
questions.

Guy_1 : What's the secondary skill for Jewelcraft ?
Yak : "There is no secondary skill for Jewelry".
Guy_2 : What's the secondary skill for Jewelcraft ?
Yak : "There is no secondary skill for Jewelry".
Guy_3 : Excuse me where is the bathroom ?
Yak : "There is no secondary skill for Jewelry".
Guy_3 : WTF ?
Guy_4 : What's the secondary skill for Jewelcraft ?
Yak : "There is no secondary skill for Jewelry".
Guy_5 : If a tree in the forest falls and no one is ...
Yak : "There is no secondary skill for Jewelry".
etc.
