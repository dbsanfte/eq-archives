I began using ZoneAlarm a few months ago, and have had no
problems with it[1]. However, the last time I reinstalled
Windows, I forgot to change a setting in ZA, and an alert
popped up while playing EQ. While I was in a fight... And
I was the puller... And I was pulling 2-3 at the time, to
maximise the exp... It really sucks to hear combat sounds
and not being able to alt-tab back into the game. As luck
would have it, I didn't die, and I seem to remember being
able to type to the group, explaining what happened.

ANYWAY! When you install ZoneAlarm, select the Alerts tab
and toggle the "Show the alert popup window" checkbox off.
That'll get rid of those alert popups, and hopefully cure
your paranoia ^_^. [2]

[1] Except that, earlier today, I had to disable ZA to be
able to browse the web... Or my ISP was acting up until I
disabled ZA in a last-ditch attempt to get things working.
Coincidence... Or CONSPIRACY?!?

[2] Two lines into this post, I noticed that the text was
fully justified, so I had to continue the trend. Is there
a name for this?
