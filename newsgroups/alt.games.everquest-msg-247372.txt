This was a little further down in the same article:

"Mini-transaction payments might not come directly from consumers. "It could
be a promotion that uses a code in a bottle cap or comes with a Happy Meal,"
said analyst Richard Doherty of Envisioneering Group, a technology

revenue rather than, 'Just buy the disc and we never hear from you again.' "

Note that this quote was not from SOE, but a consultant.  fwiw
