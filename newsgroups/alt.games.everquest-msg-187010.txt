Not 75%, just 75.

The basic formula is

    XP = ZEM * L * L

where L is the mob's level.

ZEM is 75 for most outdoor zones.

Before they started using high ZEMs to attract people to places like the
Hole, here were some known values:

    114 for Qeynos Hills and North Qeynos
    100 for Nektulos, Ill Omen, and a few other newbie zones
     80 for most dungeons
     75 GFay and the Iksar newbie zones other than Ill Omen

(Ill Omen dropped to 75 when they did the first big ZEM adjustment patch)

It used to be easy to find the ZEM, since the server sent your current XP to
the client after every kill.  Somewhere around the time they started
fiddling with ZEMs, they changed it so that the server just tells the client
what percentage the XP is at.  This is why the XP bar moves less smoothly
now, if you are killing things that give less than 1%.  If a particular kill
moves you past a 1% boundary, you get a 1% jump in the bar, otherwise no
jump (the server still knows exact XP, of course, so this is just a display
effect).  So, measuring ZEM is no long a simple matter of killing a single
mob while running ShowEQ and having ShowEQ tell you what the ZEM was.

Now, you either have to kill a bunch of mobs while using ShowEQ to calculate
ZEM, or you have to zone in, kill one, and zone out (you get an exact XP
update on zoning).

Anyway, most people, when they are talking about XP bonuses, tend to use the
outdoor zones as a baseline.  So, a zone with a ZEM of 100 would have a 33%
bonus.  A zone with a ZEM of 75 has a 0% bonus.
