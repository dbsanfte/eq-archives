My druid was level 44 when I created my enchanter (and promptly moved it to
my 2nd account shortly after he got clarity <g> ).

Quite frankly, soloing an enchanter at 8 is pretty much the same as soloing
a druid.  Fight close to your bind point. <g>

In groups, don't be the first to melee, but DO melee.  Also cast your level
4 stun, your latest DOT and of course, mez adds.  Have root memmed if you
don't have a druid or ranger who can snare.

Enchanter self-defense/escape tools:
Root (like any other pure int/wis caster)
Stun - gains you a few seconds
Mez - gains you...24?...seconds.

ALWAYS have mez memmed...NEVER dump it for something else unless you're in a
zone where nothing can be mezzed (Kael comes immediately to mind).

Stun casts faster than mez, so if a critter is hitting you stun them first,
then mez. I believe that stun wears off before mez is cast, but the fewer
times you're hit while trying to cast, the better chance of the spell
continuing anyway.  This is obvious, of course. <g>
