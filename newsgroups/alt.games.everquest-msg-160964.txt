I have an MSI GeForce 3 with 128mb DDR RAM and 512MB of DDR RAM for my
system.  I am having major problems with my computer locking up anywhere
from 3 minutes to 2 hours into play on the Kayne Bayle server.
Where do I begin with attempting to solve this irritating problem.  I can't
even enjoy the game any more because I know the dreaded lockup is coming.

Somebody help, please!!!!!
