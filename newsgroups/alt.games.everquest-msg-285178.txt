	I didn't realize you were only talking about raids.

	Try taking a group with, say 2 wizards, a chanter,and a cleric 
through some of the high end kunark-velious-luclin content.  The chanter 
pulls, the cleric hots himself, stuns the mob, and then tanks it.  I 
guarantee that unless your casters are total boxed slackers  you'll burn 
the target down before that first hot fades.

	A good trio for Veksar and Acrylia and the like is 
chanter/necro/cleric.  Same deal, necro or chanter pulls, cleric holds
aggro while pets tank, everyone nukes.  Even before mana regen items
became as common as plague rat tails we could kill nonstop in those zones.

	Ok, so maybe it's not your strict definition of Raid Main Assist.
So very sorry...
