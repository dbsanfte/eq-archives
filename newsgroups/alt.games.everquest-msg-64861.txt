Hehe. I just wish the silk drop in Velk's was anything like the thread
drop rate.

There, there. I started combining 5 and 5 threads when I was at skill
90 and it was trivial then. Combining with bile in the bile soaker
never fails, and the end result is trivial at tailoring 115 or 117. Go
to CC, farm 100 silks, head to Thurgadin and start cranking out
crystalline silk masks (108), caps (115) and mantles (118).
