If you can't afford to buy a new sound card that's fine.  Don't expect me to
be sympothetic towards it, especially if you're so hardassed you can't scrap
up $50* to buy a SB Live (at least).

And, I ran a check on pricewatch.com, and you can pick up a SB Live! value
(oem) for (starting at) US$41.00 + US$12.00.


*: Oops. My first estimate of $100 was a bit high. *shrug* Oh well.
