Like that, also note that "normally" druid and mage ds don't stack so that's
the first step :)
There are some items that help a lot ofcourse, but I think the theoretical
(theoretical means only mage's 33pt for all mage and druid target ds-es) max
was around 150 with the best items. Any higher is using sploits.

Someone know of a link with the details? Messageboard spam goes fast and
with ezboard search not wokring it's hard to find things back.
