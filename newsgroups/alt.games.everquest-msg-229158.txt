I play on one a Dell laptop as well.  I *highly* recommend you download and use
Omega's ATI drivers for your notebook.  Dell hasn't updated their drivers in
nearly a year.

The Omega drivers will work for any Radeon, including Mobility.  This is a big
plus, since you can't get Mobility drivers direct from ATI.
