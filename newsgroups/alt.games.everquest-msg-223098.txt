Don't you just love semantics! No need to change the color of the text
when it was/is already possible to change the shade of the background
thus making the text more visible. It has also been mentioned that this
solution is not perfect, to which I agree. Basically all I'm trying to
say is that I would have liked the option to return the text color to
it's original shade. While there was an imperfect solution to your
problem, Sony has left no solution to mine.
