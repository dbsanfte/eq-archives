Expect 3-4 hours of prep time (at least), followed by 3 minutes
of fighting, followed by either 40 minutes of rezzing the dead
and rolling for loot (in the case of success), or 2-3 hours of
corpse recovery (in case of failure).

So don't plan on doing ANYTHING else that day.  And bring a
book, or have the TV nearby, there's a lot of "hurry up and
wait".

Dragon raids *can* be done a lot faster, but seldom are.

Prep time consists of:

    1. Waiting for enough people to finally arrive.

    2. Getting buff groups organized.

    3. Buffing everyone on the raid, with 12-15 buffs each
       in a very specific order.  (Dragons will dispell your
       buffs, so you get a number of "junk" buffs first to
       be "sacrificed", followed by less important buffs,
       and lastly your most critical buffs like magic resist
       and fire resist.)

    4. Camping out to a designated EQ chatroom the instant
       you're all buffed up, so that your buffs won't wear
       off while you're waiting for more of your raid party
       to be buffed.

    5. Waiting in the chatroom until everyone else is
       done being buffed and camps to the chatroom (including
       the buff group itself).

    6. Listening to the raid leader give a strategy speech
       in the chat room, and then fielding questions and
       answers, and assigning people to groups.

    7. Everyone leaving the chatroom and re-entering the
       game upon the leader's signal, then forming up into
       the assigned groups.

Actually killing the dragon (or not) just takes a few
minutes.  The key things to keep in mind are:

   1.  Spells will NOT land on the dragon at all 
       unless the caster is within melee distance.
       Even so, dragons have pretty high MR, many of
       your spells will bounce off.

   2.  "Melee distance" means that you're close enough
       to give the dragon a manicure.

   3.  Getting physically hit by the dragon is the
       least of your problems (although if he *does*
       turn his attention to you, you won't last long,
       Vox/Nagafen claw for 200-250's), your biggest
       danger is his flame breath (or in the case of
       Vox, her freezing breath).  It can do up to
       about 500HP to absolutely everyone in the raid
       (it's an AoE) whenever he decides to blast.
       Fire resistance can help to lower the amount
       of damage, or sometimes even totally resist it.
       But even with a Fire Resist of 222, here are my
       AoE messages from a Nagafen raid I was on a couple
       of days ago:

Your body combusts as the lava hits you.  You have taken 180 points of damage.
Your body combusts as the lava hits you.  You have taken 145 points of damage.
Your body combusts as the lava hits you.  You have taken 130 points of damage.
Your body combusts as the lava hits you.  You have taken 365 points of damage.
Your body combusts as the lava hits you.  You have taken 490 points of damage.
Your body combusts as the lava hits you.  You have taken 430 points of damage.
Your body combusts as the lava hits you.  You have taken 480 points of damage.
Your body combusts as the lava hits you.  You have taken 500 points of damage.

       I think the transition from 130-180 damage to 430-500
       damage happened when I got out of range of the Bard in
       our group (he was singing the songs which provide massive
       resists).

    4. The other problem is getting Feared.  You may spend
       a lot of time running uncontrollably back out to the
       buff hallway (and then running back in on purpose once
       the Fear wears off).  But this isn't dangerous, just
       annoying (and could even save your life since the more
       time you spend out of range of the AoE, the longer you
       may live).  But it can cause the raid to fail (and
       then EVERYBODY dies) if too many people spend too much
       time running Feared instead of fighting.  High Magic
       Resist and (especially) higher level will help protect
       you against this.  I used to be feared a lot on
       dragon raids, now at level 52 I'm never feared at all
       (although I do have a decent -- but not great --
       unbuffed MR too thanks to resist gear).

The general strategy on Nagafen raids is to send the tanks
(and their clerics) in first, to beat Nagafen down to about
half health, and then all the casters run in and chain-nuke
him.

If he falls, it takes a while to rez everyone who was killed,
and then the raid leader will allow rolls on whatever loot
dropped.  It's generally very fine loot.  Most raids work
on a one roll ONLY per person rule -- choose which loot
piece you want a chance at, and then roll ONLY on that
item.  Also, most raids only allow the most "appropriate"
classes to roll on an item (for example, only melee classes
can roll on the haste-enhancing Cloak of Flames, even
though technically a shaman could use one), and if nothing
drops that's appropriate for your class during that raid,
well, that's just bad luck, try again next time.

Finally, if the raid fails, expect a lengthy corpse recovery
and rez operation, because most of the corpses will now
be scattered around a still living, and very cranky, dragon,
which makes extraction a bit difficult to say the least.
