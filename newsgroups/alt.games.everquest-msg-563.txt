Serious offers only, bids must be in before tomorrow.

Circumstances beyond my control require me to
give up EQ.  Thus no offers for trades or PP will
be considered.

Posessions include
JBoots (Click activated near SOW speed)
Drakkal Icegrinder (27/45 2hb, a cleric with credible melee capability!)

EEBag (70% weight reduction pack)

Character has every spell thru 49 with the exception
of the SOV drop only 39 one, turning of the unnatural;
including Celestial Healing (the 44 SOV drop only spell,
which is HoT!) including the 90% exp return ressurrection
spell.

2hb combat skill is at the max cap for the class, 1hb is between
150 and 160, Specialize Alteration near level cap, other spell
skills also high (conjuration is lowest, at around 110) as befits
a well used character, not a PL/Twinked one.

As you can see from the equipped stats above, this is
in no way a stripped down character; rather, an excellent
mix of cleric quest armor and other armor pieces chosen
to maximize Wisdom primarily, and AC secondarily.

Character also has a 185 skill with blacksmithing, and a
197 in the invaluable Alcolhol Tolerance skill... though
I may go back on and max that out in a farewell party.

Also on the account a somewhat twinked 19 woodie bard
with MMBattledrums, fun to play but used as often as not
for CR; with locate corpse song and invis song, the
character can find and pull a body out of almost any
situation.  Arguably a rogue would be better in some
circumstances... but I didn't enjoy playing a rogue anywhere
near as much as the bard.

I wish I could say I was glad to be leaving... but the
truth is I've had a great time with the game and specifically
with this character.
