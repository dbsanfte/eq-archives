I was thinking of asking the same questions for my bard.

He can illusion DE, or invis, but that won't help if the pop spot is where he
can be seen.  He can also put up selos, but that would only work outdoors, and
there aren't many outdoor locations he'd bother gating away from.

But with POP, a gate to OT wouldn't be a bad thing at all if it would be safe
for him to pop into.

Another question, how much faction do I need to do the quest?  Illusion DE
plus faction song do the job?  I wandered around OT ages ago shortly after
getting the DE mask, if I recall correctly, and nothing aggroed, but that was
as far as I looked, back then OT was a distant backwater of little interest to
me.
