I bet you if 100 people respond, all of us have different ideas on what to hunt
and so forth...  LOL  Here is my typical plan:

Lvl 1 - 8 or 9: Field Of Bone.  Good xp and lots of wonderful bone chips drop
that you can sell in bazaar.

Lvl 10 - 14 or so: Kurn's Tower (which is in Field of Bone :)  )  Again, nice
xp and many bone chips.

14 - 18 or so: Paludal Caverns hunting Pharty Guys.  You have to group these or
duo with a healer preferably.  They have a rather wicked disease affectionately
referred to as 'The Crud'  Loot is bleh, xp is awesome.

18 - 24: Paludal Caverns in a Bandit Group.  Loot is ok, xp is phenominal.

24 - 35: High Hold Keep Basement Goblins.  Loot excellent, xp excellent.

35 - 46: LDoN, LDoN, LDoN!!!  Earn those points, get fairly ok loot and really
good xp.

46 on up: Continue to LDoN but now start mixing in some Plane of Justice Exit
Groupage to begin with and then branch out to all the other planes as they
become available to you at your level.

That is just my way of doing things quickly.  However, don't forget that if you
do your levelling in this fashion, you miss out on Great Divide Giants.  If you
want to do Prayer Shawl quest for example, you need to spend time killing these
guys too.  

Sadly, with all the expansion zones now, most people follow the above
guidelines and all of those wonderful Old World zones are bereft of players. 
:(  I do still go to the Gorge, Runnyeye, Splitpaw, KFC, and so forth for a
change of pace and when I don't wish to be bothered by any other players. 
Remember, maybe you don't... but there used to be a waiting list to grab a
spire at Split Paw.  I recall fondly grouping there a lot.  (Autosplit off/Loot
to 5pp or FS whichever comes first hehe)  Now you can pretty much go straight
to Paw and have it all to yourself.  :(

Oh, and Karana Bandits in your teens?  Bah, those guys have all become fat and
lazy because nobody messes with them anymore.  I remember many the group wipe
camping those buggers...  LOL  (Auto Split on/Alpha Sashes!)  

Many times I have thought about trying to start a new toon and levelling the
'old' way, but then I realize that there is no practical way to do that since
there are no groups in those zones anymore.

Anyway, that is just my 2 copper...
