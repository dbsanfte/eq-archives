I never said he wasn't being irritating.  The point of contention was
that this person was somehow keeping people from collecting bone
chips.  

Your beggar example would be more accurate if someone had contended
that beggars were FORCING people go give them stuff.  And still, that
would be wrong too.

Other than being totally impossible, I don't think I'd like to see a
Happy Police running around.

>Example stands if you get the context after I explained it.

I never said that the example didn't stand.  I said it was a bad
example.
