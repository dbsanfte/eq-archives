?!?

I'll assume you only mean the selling of multiquests is an abuse.  In 
that, you might be right, in some cases.  I'd damn well rather have MQs in 
the game than have them removed to keep someone from selling MQ rights to 
an AC ring though.

Even at the, calling it a blatant and outright abuse of the quest engine 
is stretching it.
