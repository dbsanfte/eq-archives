Not relative?  Screw the numbers, it IS the "movement" that matters, since,
when the AAXP bar -finally- "moves" both blue and orange bar over to the
right, AAXP DING.

You can practice rocket science all day long, but, in my book, seeing those
bars "move" slower than they normally would, while killing the -same- mobs I
once was but gaining about 25% more AAXP then, than I am now, this game has
now turned into a much greater timesink than it was already.

I -seriously- wish I was a 14 year old with petty homework to do (no
insinuations here, just stating the truth about my feelings) at the end of
the 2:45PM day, but, long and behold, I am a much older (unfortunately)
working individual in the retail business.  Seeing all the Venereables,
Dukes, etc.  around me and only having 24 AA's on my "main," it really hurts
to know that I'm that much further from "catching up" than before.  <shrug>
Will I quit?  <shrug>  I'd hate to, though, close friends that NEVER talk a
bit of BS (rambling out of anger type BS) about quitting actually are for
the first time that I recall.  Hell, if I have no friends (RL ones) to play
the game with (those that I got into this game) then, whats the point of
playing, more over if it's going to take me another year now to reach Duke,
Sensei, etc.  It sucks and I seriously hope those that are disappointed with
the changes state their opinion(s) in a professional manner to Verant via
email or /feedback such as I have done.
