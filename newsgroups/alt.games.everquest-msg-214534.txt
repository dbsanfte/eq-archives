Got into a bit of a, well, not argument, but discussion
about this last night. A person in PoK with plague
mites. I ooced that he needed a cure curse because
the night before, when our party got hit with it, both
myself and the 51 ranger with us cast cure disease
multiple multiple times on ourselves and others to
try to get rid of them. I finally quit casting it at
15 times on myself. Someone else told me that their
group had used cure disease and got rid of it and
'you just have to cast it more than once, like spreading
crud.'

Not saying they didn't have that experience, but if 15
times casting it isn't going to get rid of it, I'm going
with the opinion it was curse based and not pure disease.
