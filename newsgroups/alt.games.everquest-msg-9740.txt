Always one of my favorites topics, this one comes to you from the "No
shit, there I was" directory in High Hold Keep last night:

We have a full group in the warrior room, and though our only healer is
a 29 shaman, the spawn is nicely broken and things are going well.
That's probably why I didn't take enough notice or get alarmed enough
when I saw that the shaman was meleeing quite a bit and running in and
out of the room between battles to check to see if anything had spawned
on the stairs, going to bank, etc.
  The next PC warrior spawns. I call "incoming" and Jump on it along
with everyone else. It aggro's on the wizard and it takes me a couple
rounds to pull it off. Shammy shoots a heal at the wiz, promptly sits
down and says, "OOM!".
  After the fight, I calmly ask him if he could have a bit more juice
than that saved up before we start a battle.
His response:
"Sorry. I wasn't watching my mana bar."
I know that I don't need to add anything else to this for you to see the
sad, cruel humor in this story.
