So far, so good.  I'm Adventurer 8/Artisan 5, and just became
acitizena nd joined a tradeskill guild in my home violliage of
Baubbleshire.  Annoyingly, I can't buy anything from them (I need fuel
in ordr to craft) until I've done some gathering quests.  I think I
can work around it, though, as there are merchants scattered around I
can use int he meantime.  (I need to collect 15 tin.  Pretty hard
given the random nature of gathering -  I'll leave the quest open,
though, and complete it naturally over time.

I know I'm going to be a jeweler, purely because I like making my own
jewelry.     :)  That's not unrtil lvl 20, though - at 10 I'll be a
Scholar.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
