Yup, had the "hit 50, go aaargh" syndrome. I trained my research up with
plain plat at trainers. Got it up to 175 and I think I wasted about 1.5kpp
on it. Then I made lvl 49, 50 and 51 in one weekend. I freaked at the
uselesness of the research skill, although as a mage the pets were
necassary.

My advice: get the few components you need for a spell you really want and
ask a high level of your class to make it. Most mains had it trained up
without thinking twice. Most alts never bother.
