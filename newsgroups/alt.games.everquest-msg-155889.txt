Exp was so fast, and downtime so laughably low, that I couldn't have
cared less.  Of course that was compared to soloing a 54+ cleric...
so "fast exp" and "low downtime" are to be taken with a grain of salt.

I killed reds not because they were best exp per hour, but because they
made me feel the most uber; reds reds reds hahahahahahhah, said I.

Druid was the same way.  Just taking him up to 34 anyway, lets see what
he can kill!  Reds reds reds, and sure there was more downtime, but
honestly, whats that matter when its just a minute or two from OOM to
FM... instead of the ten minutes it takes my cleric to get the same visible
distance, and that from nuke root killing a low blue?

I just don't take my twinks seriously, I suppose, they are, after all,
no more than a lark for me.  Its not like I'm making a bot alt, or
can't find high level groups with my old main so I'm making a replacement.
