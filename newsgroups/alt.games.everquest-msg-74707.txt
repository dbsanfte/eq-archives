It's a shame that DAOC is just not particularly fun unless you're into PvP.
Nothing to look forward to...unless you're into PvP.  And even that's not
enough (I was looking forward to it but at level 17 I just gave up waiting)
unless you're REALLY into PvP.

But yeah, those advantages you mention, #1 is a great advantage, #2...I
don't necessarily agree with.  #3 I play a caster so it makes no difference
to me. #4 is a fantastic advantage.  #5 is a "cool" feature but (being a
guild leader in EQ) it's a lot more powerful than it needs to be.  If you
have to use all those customization options (or even more than just a few)
you've got a serious problem with your guild.

You forgot a big DAOC advantage, a /friend (may be misremembering the name)
channel.  Similar to what I've always wanted EQ to do with a raid channel.
