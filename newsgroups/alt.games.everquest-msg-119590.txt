I was thinking this would be a nice ability.
You would see a mob off always a bit, sneak up near it then "set trap" sneak
away then hail the mob or use a range weapon on it.It would turn and run at
you step on trap then blammo "burst of fire" would hit him for (what ever
that spells dmg is). Higher lev rogues would be able to set higher lev dd
traps like ignite or some thing.Of course a duration for the trap would be a
must,something like 30 sec,or rogues would line a whole zone full of them if
there skill is high enough.Any way what do you guys think?
