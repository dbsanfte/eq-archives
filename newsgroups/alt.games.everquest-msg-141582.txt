I only ever did Naggy once, with my magician.  It was a pickup raid... it
took us around 3 hours to organise.. over an hour to buff/camp out and go to
chat etc.. and the end result- 4 corpses and a failed raid.

I don't remember whos raid it was... but it was one of the most unorganised
zerg-fests i've ever seen

Sebilis was the only dungeon I hunted in throughout my 50's-60 leveling
period, so I saw an absolute shit-load of loot drop.  I must have had the
worst luck ever though, friends who went a few times won 15k+ items, wheras
I lost the randoms day after day after day after week after month.

My luck was so bad... and then the first time I ever went to the King camp,
I won the fungi (the top "exp group" loot in the zone).

A long time after, I returned to a king group once again (which was then my
second time there) and again won the only fungi.

Of course I sold 1 for 20k when the price plummeted.. and they are now worth
60k+

And the other fungi, I traded 7k+fungi for a PSC.  Ended up selling the PSC
for 12k :(
