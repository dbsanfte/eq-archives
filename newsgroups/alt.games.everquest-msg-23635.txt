    Tee hee, yup. Bluebie sensibilities come to Sullon Zek. If you look at
how the evil team has been developing itself, the strategy is clear - level
up like any blue player would, free of PvP because of overwhelming numbers
in many of the "prime" spots to level, THEN go and grief-kill the other
teams into oblivion. I imagine that's why the PvP points total for evil was
reported to be less than the Neutral total - many of the evils simply aren't
fighting anyone.
