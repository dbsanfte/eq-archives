Kill them?  Or at least occupy them.

I know that may sound smartass, but I'm being serious.  My guild runs into a
wall every now and then where an encounter is simply designed to be taken by
a much larger force.  It's rough on the anti-zerg strategic guilds, but
sometimes Sony just wants you to zerg.

From your accounts that I've read here, you often raid with more people
than my entire guild roster, including raid-able alts.  This "running into a
wall" concept may be foreign to you.  :)

Not bashing zerg guilds at all.  Quite the opposite, in order to progress
past certain levels they are almost a necessity.  The #1 guild on my server
is recruiting heavily because they were always a strategy-over-zerging guild
and it's biting them in the ass right now.
