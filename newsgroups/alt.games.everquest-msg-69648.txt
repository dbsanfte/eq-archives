High Elf Don't waste your time with these filthy beasts - um, your basically
the same race, oh brite one.  cannot help it if you wanna live in rock, and
splintered from us, your Couzins.

57th Enchanter

with regards to two of the original question:

So, what race?  personally if you choose high INT you will have the best
mana, and that is mostly what wizzies want.  although erudites have most INT
their also blind at night, same with humans.

Also depends on if your going to be trying to roleplay with this char, or
just for power game purposes.  Playing a Gnome definitely ::feels::
differently than playing a troll, because the view changes a little based on
size.

distribute points:  probably best to put all you can into INT, 5 into your
second prime stat, CON.

remember meeting a druid who one of my chars was totally amazed at.  He had
like the lowest possible wis you could have, if you tried to get it as low
as possible.  didn't put any points into it.  definitely would be
interesting to play a druid who doesn't cannot do as much spell casting as
another druid.  ROFL
