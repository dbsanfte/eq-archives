I also must congratulate you on this fine program.  I have been using an
older version but will be upgrading tonight.  One question I'm curious on
(cant wait to see) is if the print function has been implimented.  I have
been manually copying my skill levels into my small notebook for in-game
reference and would love to have this printed out.

thanks

Orlun, 39th Rogue of Xev
