Get lightsource or play a race with some sort of nightvision (most of them)

I couldn't even tell you if I was indoors or out

No map?

Maps were added in Ykesha. But most players got on fine without them for 
years. [Aside from old fashioned paper ones]

  No radar?

You really don't like not knowing what's behind a closed door do you? Or 
turning around to look behind you? Granted the situation awareness is 
suboptimal, but its hardly the end of the world.

  Camera that won't follow from behind
> your avatar? 

They follow behind just fine. RTFM. Though EQ is really better in First 
Person for most things.

  The only thing I could kill by myself were grubs?slugs?

Welcome to level 1. I recall hunting bunnies in AC, and some sort of 
insect in AO...grubs and slugs are par for the course.
