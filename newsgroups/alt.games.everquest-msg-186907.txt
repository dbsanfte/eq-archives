Last time in CoD we had an Enc charm soloing at zone (the character
is an old friend, whoever was playing him isn't) and he was basically
training zo every two minutes when charm wore off as it allowed him
to come back in invis to clear aggro and start over with minimum
risk.

Another time when we were attempting Carprin we had a Nec come up and
ask if he could grab a pet, we said sure and he then turned down the
first three candidates that arrived as they "sucked" as pets.

Greater Corrupted Pusling to zone!
