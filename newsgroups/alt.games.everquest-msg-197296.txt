17 is probably too low for effective use of fear, mana cost is high, duration is very
short, and frankly the mobs at this level are still such wimps that preventing them
hitting you isn't necessarily a priority yet.

But in your 20s, fear kiting becomes a very strong plan for hunting; with a snarer,
my cleric happily feared mobs on and off for dozens of levels.  Once fear isn't
expensive, and mobs start hitting really hard compared to your HP totals, then making
them turn their backs and stroll away became a very real plan.  Biggest problem was a
cleric doesn't bring much to this plan other than the fear; his nukes and melee both
tend to the low end of the scale; you'd be better off with a necro or SK fearer.

I've always thought, though, that an enchanter might also make an excellent Fear half
of a fear/snare team.  Get hit once so your pet is on the mob and your DPS is already
higher

Aye, at 12 you are probably right, I don't remember a cleric, necro, or SK fear being
worth using till over 20, either. Still, 1 to 20 is such a blink of the eye that its
a question of tactics, not strategy.  Fear will, in the long run, work out very
nicely for those other fear classes, and heck, even for druid or ranger animal fear
kiters.

I've heard it suggested that a soloing cleric can hunt certain beetles at very low
levels using fear because they run as slowly as if snared.  I do know I used to hunt
Spectres and later Cobalt Drakes using this same principle; artificially slow moving
mobs, no snarer needed.

Another thought is this.  If he's running around as a 12 chanter with a 52 druid alt,
and he doesn't have KEI, its not because he CAN'T have it.  He's deliberately
forgoing it.  Which is fine, perhaps even admirable.

But maybe, just maybe, if he's as clueless as he seems, he just doesn't know.  For 25
pp more or less per charge, he can have a young enchanter thats literally incapable
of running out of mana, and with care can level up to his 20s pretty fast.
