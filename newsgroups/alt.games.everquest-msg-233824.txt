I would like to know your observations on the amount of split in LDoN. Does
it seems like on particular theme brings more money and other bring less?
This is my personal observation, of course very subjective and dependant on
the honsetly of ML since I never ML myself (I don't believe in Enchanters
main-looting... We have other more pressing matters at hands usually):
6 people groups, no one skips the split,
1. North Ro. Usually outrageous amounts from gems. 50-70 at lvl 40 (av. lvl
of the group 40) up to 260-340 at 55
2. BB. Lots of bare plat. 40-50 at 40 and ~200 at 55
3+4 EC and South Ro
5. EFP, never a lot of plat. Usually 2 times less than in NRo or MM

Is it just my imagination, or do I systematically get unfair looters at EFP.
