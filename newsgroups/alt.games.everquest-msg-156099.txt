I'm new to the game, just created an Erudite necromancer, and I have no 
previous experience with teleporters. The first one I came across was a 
surprise but easy enough to figure out, so I thought. Experimenting with 
the ones I came across to see where they would take me, I ended up on a 
red platform in a small, glass-enclosed place which I would guess 
(looking at eqatlas) is the observatory, and I can't for the life of me 
figure out how to get back out. Standing on the platform doesn't seem to 
take me anywhere, haven't found anything I can click on that does 
anything in the room, tried clicking on the key I was given in the 
beginning of the game, even tried jumping up and down on the platform in 
a panic fit, all to no avail. Am I stuck now and just screwed, or am I 
just missing something basic. Didn't find anything helpful in the manual 
or in my first few searches of google groups, so I thought I'd ask here 
before giving up and restarting.

Thanks for any help!

Kris
