For a name that simply violates the rules in general? No. But, you do
risk banning for a blatantly obscene name. Usually you get off with a
warning or suspension at most. During the time following 9-11,
however, names such as "Osaaama Benladin" tended to result in
immediate banning. ( As did tasteless jokes about 9-11 if they were
/reported or seen in public channels by a GM )

I think that rather depends on how bad it is. Mierde (sp?) would be
treated just as harshly as it's english counterpart. Non-vulgar
non-english names might slip, though.
