If I had the money to buy a Cray, I wouldn't care about any of your
and nospam's claims. It would be immaterial what you thought,
claimed, or said.

What really astounds me is the two of you ranting for days over
nothing. I made a joke, 'If I had the money for a Cray', that right
there should have clued both of you into the FACT that anything you
say telling me it wouldn't work was a waste of your own time. And
all those poor electrons you wasted in telling me something I'll
never do wont work.
