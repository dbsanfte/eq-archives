These changes will mean nothing to the high level game. The time and xp
needed to get from 1-10 is negligible compared to what's needed at high
levels. Even the changes to dungeons will only affect characters up to 30.
Again the time and xp needed for the first 30 levels is very small compared
to what's needed for the next 30.
