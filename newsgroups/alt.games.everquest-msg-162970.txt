I'm not privy to the details of these spells, but isn't WR the highest haste %
spell in a chanter's book?

The idea, as explained to me, was that people prefer VoG/SoV to WR because of
stat buffs or attack buffs or something like that, even though WR is better
from a haste standpoint.

Combining WR with SoV means you get both the highest haste and the most useful
buff effects.

Apparantly this was done deliberately

Not stack, but you get the best haste of the haste buffs on you.

WR is often referred to in my guild as "cleric haste" because I'm supposedly
the only guy meleeing without a 35%+ haste item.  In fact, though, many of the
other melee in the guild are also using 22 or 26% items.  SO just as I ask
tanks what their AC is before deciding whether to drop an AC buff on them, a
chanter could ask what people's item haste % is.
