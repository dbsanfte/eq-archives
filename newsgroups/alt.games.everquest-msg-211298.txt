Not that immersiveness is very high on their list anymore, but, at one 
time, they did call this a role playing game.  Telling you directly the 
relative level would be kind of counter productive in that respect.  
These messages were put in a long time ago, back when they still deluded 
themselves into thinking that people would play this as a role playing 
game.  Not to say that some don't, do so, but, the vast majority of EQ 
players do not role play.

As a soloing shaman, I find that the conning system generally does work 
for me.  Dark blues are reasonably doable for me, including summoning 
ones.  The place where this really broke down was in PoP.  The mobs in 
PoP zones generally hit much harder than other mobs.  The other exception 
is raid target mobs.

The other thing to consider is that SoE has, and still does, encourage 
people to group by a variety of means.  One of them is to make it tougher 
to solo mobs that are a few levels below you than it was at lower levels.  
In that fashion, the conning system at higher levels is more group 
oriented than solo player oriented.

You are right though, it is a learning experience, at low levels, the 
conning system works fairly well for the solo player, but gradually it 
does start to break down.  The thing is that it is fairly gradual, and 
most players do learn that over time.
