KEI (Koadic's Endless Intellect) or C3 as its often known is lvl 60
spell which combines the effects of C2, Brilliance, Insight & Gift of
Brilliance plus a bit more.  It gives +25 to Int & Wiz, +250 to your
mana pool & increases mana regen rate by 14.  It has a duration
(unenhanced)of 2h 30mins.  This duration can be extended by a
combination of focus effects on Items such a 8th Shawl & AA skills by
upto 70%, giving a total duration of about 4 hours.

The next 2 clarity spells are Tranquility (+26 int/wis, 260 mana, 16
mana regen) & Voice of Quellious (+28 int/wis, 275 mana, 18 mana
regen) have a duration of 1h 20mins.

The reason that people are prepared to pay for KEI, especially if
extended, is that it enables them to play for a whole session with
enhanced mana regen even if there's no handy chanter.  It does upset
some folks though if after they have bought KEI they join a group with
a chanter who immediatly casts C5 as part of the pre fight buffing
session.  Making that sort of fuss is a quick way to my ignore list :)
