    FoH is actually on a merit-based award system. It's Afterlife that's on
DKPs, and indeed it was their system that started the use of the term "DKP".

    All systems have flaws, all have strengths. The key is to tailor your
system to your guild. Let me give you an example of a poorly thought-out DKP
system, recently enacted by one of our competitors:

    All items are sorted into "tiers". Tier 1 items are droppable and/or
low-end items. Tier 4 items are the best of the best. When someone pays DKPs
for an item, the point cost they pay is multiplied by the tier of the item
they're getting divided by the tier of the item they used to have in that
slot. So, for example, if someone wanted the Aten neck (tier 4), and
currently had a Necklace of Superiority (tier 1), they would have to pay
(4/1) = 4 times the usual DKPs for it.

    The guildleader has all tier 4 items. He leads the guild in points, as
only he can award spur-of-the-moment points for things like farming bane
components (and therefore he's present to earn those points). I'll give you
three guesses what this system is REALLY intended to do.

    Now, here's the "poor fit" part: he recently expanded his guildroster by
a tremendous amount to try and get his guild back on top on the server (they
used to be, until all the officers and old-timers revolted against him and
left). So the majority of the guild are newcomers, who don't have tier four
items. Their reaction, once they realize what this is really intended to do,
should be amusing.
