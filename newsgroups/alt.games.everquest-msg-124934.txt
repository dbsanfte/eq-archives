}I've requested money up front ever since I could <SoW> (yeah, I know
}it's generally free, but when you're like level 14 and have to travel
}all the way across the zone to SoW someone who is advertising "paying
}10pp for a SoW," I want my money up front.

I dunno... the main problem I have wih this is that far too frequently, 
I'm expecting to pay up front, and then while I'm busy trying to set the 
stupid coin slider to the right amount, the port fires or the rez box 
appears and I end up having to start over. :)  Particularly frustrating 
when it's the TL box... bastard, now I -can't- donate! grr... :)

}off, or otherwise shirking their promised obligation. These morons are
}pretty pathetic, in essence they have sold their rep for a 10pp
}ride....  and what's even worse is when I hear about <high level>
}characters doing this shit.

The funniest one I remember was when I managed to get myself killed on 5th 
floor of ToFS while soloing.  Oh dear, gonna need a ecr and a cleric and a 
coffin... sigh.  So I start making some calls, and a necro starts heading 
hat way, then I get a cleric, who'll be glad to help if I get her a port, 
so I manage to locate a TL to get her from wherever it was she was that 
I wasn't, to Iceclad, where I also wasn't. Hmm... somehow the Wizard was 
TLing me, too, I think, but I was naked and penniless.  So now I have 
three people in 2 different zones that I'm not in that I need to donate 
to.  So I switch  to an alt that happens to be near where the wizard 
went and run over, only to find that I have less on that alt than I'd 
offered, so I gave her half, and switched to a third alt that's also in 
the same spot (tunnel in ec), and find that the wizard has moved on to 
gfay... luckily, this alt's a lowbie wizard thogh, so I chase her down and 
force cash on her. :) Then I switch back to Zinny and run off to ToFS, 
where the necro and cleric are smacking up the first level.  So the necro 
summons my corpse, and I loot the cash so I can donate for the coffin...

But I have a massive brain fart and stupidly loot everything.  Argh! So 
then I have to convince the cleric she sold take the money anyway since 
it's my mistake, and -no- She didn't somehow fool me into thinking I'd 
already been rezzed.  She was such a sweetheart, though.

So all told I've spent about an hour and a half of my time and other 
people's time and 350pp, and didn't even get my rez.  Argh.  Got my stuff 
back though.  Time to camp.
