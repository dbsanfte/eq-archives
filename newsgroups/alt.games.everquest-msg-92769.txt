Hi all

Am very frustrated at the way I need to get my pet/buff spells in East
Cabilis. That ladder has exhauted me and I am tired of trying and
would like to know if I can simply buy my spells in Shir Vahl? I don't
care about training just buying spells. Is this possible or do I need
to get some kinda faction.

Also where is a good place to go to gain faction so that perhaps I
could use the trainers there?


Thanks.
