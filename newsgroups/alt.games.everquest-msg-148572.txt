If Gore is just an overgrown Vox (we haven't done her yet), not only would
you want to ToT her, but also Mana Sieve constantly.  Recast time is slow,
but not horribly so (maybe 10 seconds...don't feel like looking) and removes
about the same amount of mana per cast as ToT (last I looked, ToT took about
50 more).

For Vox, the raid's going to fail without 3 sieving enchanters...I don't
know what Gore's mana pool is like.
