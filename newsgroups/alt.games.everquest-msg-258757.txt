You are correct, I was overthinking things; since the mobs strike every 
3 seconds and the regen hits every 6 seconds, I somehow thought dividing 
by two would be the correct procedure.

DPS has divided the mob's average damage per round by three already, 
though, so you'ld have to divide Regen by 6 as you point out, to get the 
same effect.

It certainly -seems- to make a fairly sizeable difference, though, 
perhaps lowbie mob DPS is much lower than I'd surmised.
