Er, no.  Gender did not come into it at all.  I actually rather suspect that
"she" is a guy; I think the Shadowknight was his main and that the mage was
his alt.  There was a sameness to their communication styles, although I had
limited samples from the SK.

Either way, gender was irrelevant.  No matter who would have acted in that
manner, I would have responded the same way.  Obnoxiousness knows no gender
limitations.  =)
