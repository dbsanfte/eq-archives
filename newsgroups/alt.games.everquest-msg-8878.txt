Yep, a really sensible person would ally with giants, life would be much
easier.  Thurgadin is out of the way, and you can pass thru the giant
area in GD safely, so you can hit wurms, kodiaks, and Tizmaks as
well as hunt Coldain in both the plain and in the city.

You'll be able (with care) to pass thru Kael Drakkar in order
to get to the larger half of velious, and will also be somewhat
safer in eastern wastes and iceclad, as there are quite a few
roaming giants and thier wolves, while you almost never see
a roaming Coldain.

Personally, as a dwarf cleric of Brell, I went with Coldain
faction, but in many ways, I think it stinks.  And those Coldain
are creepy looking too, it wouldn't be hard for "good"
characters to see them as evil and the giants as merely
misunderstood good guys.

One nice thing; killing all those giants, my veeshan faction
has also been skyrocketing, perhaps I won't be as
irritated as I am now, when I get to the point where
skyshrine is an obstacle.
