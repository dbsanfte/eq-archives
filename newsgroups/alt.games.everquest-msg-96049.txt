er that is not really the percentage. No one knows what it is.

Nope. It always works once you hit 100. Damn nice skill.
Heals 25% of your current hit points including HP and STA buffs.
Works while fighting, standing, sitting, Feigned death,
underwater, etc. Always.

EXCEPT when you get that weird bug that happens once in a while
where it gives you this message:

You must wait X seconds before you can use mend again.

Where X is anything from 0(figure that one out!) to some ungodly
high numbers like 739293347. This really sucks because even though
the skill didn't fire off you must wait the 6 minutes again because the
skill button will still grey out. To fix it log out and back in again.
