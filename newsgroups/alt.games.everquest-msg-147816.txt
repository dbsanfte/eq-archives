EQ is written so that your character will always be in the last chat channel
you set as default...until you change it.  I don't think that carries over
to other characters, but once you make the chance once, it should be set,
even if you go LD or camp.

If you use multiple chat windows more info may apply, but I'm not going to
get into that if I don't have to. :)
