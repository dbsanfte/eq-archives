Yes, blacksmithing will use STR if it is higher than INT and WIS.  If he 
had said that about a different tradeskill, he could have a legitimate 
argument.  A person who is really seriously into tradeskills really does 
need to have their INT or WIS as high as possible.  Of course, the best 
bet then is to make a WIS or INT caster to begin with, they have a higher 
potential cap for those stats anyway.
