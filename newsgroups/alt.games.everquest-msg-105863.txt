Hi, tell me a group that takes a magician over a druid... or a necro over a
druid..

An example that will so never happen, it's almost funny.
How many people *unbuffed* (or with level 34 cleric buffs) break 6k hp?
Since your talking a level 60 person here also, note they wouldn't both
receive exp.

At 34th level a cleric is chealing for maybe ONE k max.

I don't care.. its not part of being a druid, you DONT deserve it, nor do
you NEED it

Give Paladins snare, root, 1k+ nukes, huge dots, regen, mana regen, debuffs,
circles, damage shields, SoW, ports.... and Im sure they will happily share
their healing spells with you.

The only area Ive noticed Paladins are particularly usful in healing, are
group heals anyway.. unless you are going to begrudge them a once in a long
ass time LoH heal too...

I guess your also dismissing the fact you need 3 AA levels and a bind skill
of 201+ to fully heal yourself.  The fact Bind wound is a very slow process,
uses a lot of bandages (my skill is maxed, and 3 aa levels, and a stack of
bandages won't heal me from a few hundred hp to full hp).  Or the fact Bind
wound can't be used while in combat.

And this is relevant because?
