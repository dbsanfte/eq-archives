Took my 31 Cazic-worshipping troll beastlord into Neriak. He'd done *no*
faction work for the Dark Elves whatsoever. Was pleasantly surprised to
discover I'm either dubious or apprehensive to all the inkies. Was more
surprised to discover the ghouls in front of necro/sk guild conned warmly
to me! Ducking to get in and out of all the buildings was a pain, but at
30 I got Shrink, so *I'm* not too inconvenienced. I already miss being
able to SoW myself in town.

Actually, not only does it appear the beastlord quests changed for more
nektulous-friendly ingredients, but it looks like shamans, warriors, and
sks got newbie quests at last! Haven't tried them out, but we may even
have inky faction quests too.
