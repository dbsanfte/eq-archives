You take the other boat, not the one that takes you to Timorous Deep.  
Also, you could not steer the boat at all.  If you go to the end of the 
rightmost dock at the harbor there in Butcherblock, and wait for the 
boat, it will eventually arrive, hop on board, and 30ish minutes later 
you will be in Freeport.

Alternatively, if you have Planes of Power, click on one of the handy 
books in Gfay, then go click on the Freeport book.
