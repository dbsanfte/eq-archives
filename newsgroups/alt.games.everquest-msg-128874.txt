Thanks all for the excellent info! Looks like Ill take a quick swing at the
Shiknar Outcasts, and if that doesnt work Ill head to Netherbian lair.

Over all though Im a bit surprised to hear that the PC has gotten as bad as
LoIO. Id rather have an enjoyable hunting experience in a lesser populated
Zone, than I would in some overpopulated "dewd" infested exp rich zone.

As to Marus Seru, yes, Ill be heading there at 22 :) My druid went from 24
to 32 in no time flat there :) Fortunately for the most part MS is almost
uninhabited on Vallon Zek due to ( I guess ) the almost complete lack of ANY
loot what so ever. Thats OK though, as if I want money I'll go hunt Tech-nas
(sp?) Gnolls outside of Splitpaw with the Druid, or if I get REALLY hard up
try to sell ports in the Bazzar.

Once again though thanks for all the insight :)
