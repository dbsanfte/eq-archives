I failed to find any humor in it whatsoever.

I think perhaps you meant, "I think it would be funny to see how many people
I can get to visit this web site."

Well, you got me to visit that web site, so you must be at least chuckling
now if not gasping for breath from full-blown hysteria.

But if anyone else wants to visit, don't bother.  Basically all it says is
"I've eaten your brain," followed by a count of how many people have visited
that web page.  Imaginative not in the least.
