The short answer is, yes.

Item haste does not stack - only the biggest one wins.  Spell haste
does not stack - again, only the best one is used.  The best spell
haste and the best item haste do stack.  There are undoubtedly odd
situations involving arcane item/buff combinations I'm not familiar
with. :)  For example, the Eyepatch of Plunder is an item, but it has a
clicky effect that counts as spell haste.

Leaving out bard songs simplifies things a lot.  Some songs count as
spell haste, whereas others count as "overhaste", or can stack with
spell haste.

Haste gained through tribute counts as item haste.  It will not stack
with a FBSS, but will stack with haste spell buffs.
