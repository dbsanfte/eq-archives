I am in a family guild that does some raiding (Xana Rumble etc). Recently we
had a few leave, as is always the case w family guilds. We allowed those who
leave (with a few exceptions) to keep their alts with us so they can still
enjoy the family atmosphere and help on raids when their new main guild
isn't raiding. For the most part it has worked out. Last night however we
had a 65 necro leave and his friend a high 50s druid also. Checking them
with /w all revealed they immediately guilded with a former members guild.
The former member admitted it and said he wanted to help out his new guild.
This former member also had alts in our guild, well....he DID at least but
we took care of that and his forums access quickly. He had left under very
good terms with us and it really ticked me off that he would do this. Now of
course we are looking at changing the policy of "leaving alts" now that it
has bit us in the butt. Went 2 years without a worry then this.

How would you have handled this?
