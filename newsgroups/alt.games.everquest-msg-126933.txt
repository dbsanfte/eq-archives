You are both right, in a sense. My understanding is that it was the opposite 
way Remington put it: Arab scholars preserved and expanded on the knowledge 
of classical Greece during the dark ages. Christian monks did their bit to 
preserve and copy some of those books, too, but Muslims scientists were 
actually doing something with that knowledge.

It is true that Islamic civilization was much more advanced in most measures  
than Christian civilization during the middle ages (and was also much more 
liberal from a religious point of view, than either Christendom or modern 
non-secular Islamic countries). It's also very true, as you pointed out, 
that it has gone to hell in a handbasket since those days.

May be the opposite, in fact... Islamic fundamentalism is taking its toll in 
academia. This may drive some established scientists to the west, but 
probably not any significant number of students (compared with, say, Chinese 
or Indian) to western universities.
