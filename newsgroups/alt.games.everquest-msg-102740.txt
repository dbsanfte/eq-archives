    When he hits 29, he changes radically. If you can grimace through five
more levels, you'll be very pleasantly surprised what he can do.

    That's huge. At 29, you get Bonds of Force, a pillar-style AoE snare (4
targets max). Standard wizard soloing from that point on is snare kiting.

    Ok, so there's our budget. :-)

    level/5 = points of MANA gained per point of INT added. So at 24 you get
4.8 MANA per INT. High level wizards usually have max INT, and wear all
manner of odd items with maximal MANA on them. Above 200, the easy
approximation is level/10 (so half as much MANA per INT).

    Depends on the slot. Some item slots (pants, belt, shoulders come to
mind) have very little choice for an INT caster.

    If you have any further questions, www.graffe.com is an excellent wizard
reference.

> Head: Savant's Cap +3 INT

    Runed Circlet is AC 4 INT/WIS 4 and dirt cheap.

> Face: Raw silk. (bleah)

    Most wizards love the Acumen Mask (AC 4 WIS 2 INT 5 No Drop and
right-click instabuff effect), a Temple of Solusek Ro quest item. It
requires one to kill Shadowed Men at one point, so if you're pairing with
georg's necromancer (whose Temple of Sol Ro quests also require Shadowed Men
drops) it would be a good item to quest up. Semi-expensive (1K or less)
masks would include Mushroom Veil, Enshrouded Veil, and Crystal Spider
Eyes - all three are variations on the same general theme. If you want to go
cheap, then while camping those Batskull Earrings get a Sheer Bone Mask (Ac
3 INT 3) - drops off the same guy.

> Shoulders: Raw silk. (bleah)

    Embroidered Black Cape, AC 4 HP 15 MANA 20 - Ghoul Ritualist in Lower
Guk (that three spawn of wizards below Ass/Sup). Very standard item,
shouldn't be expensive to purchase, either.

> Neck: Loam Encrusted Choker +10 Mana

    Sapphire Platinum necklace is STR 7, INT 7. Black Sapphire Platinum
necklace is HP/MANA 55. Both are player-made. Beyond that, Petrified Erudite
Heart Necklace (Ac 2 INT 5 MANA 15, kobold noble in Sol B), Spider Fang
Choker (Ac 3 STA 2 AGI 2 MR/CR 5 MANA 20, from Crystal Caverns), Chipped
Bone Collar (Ac 4 HP/MANA 10, same guy that drops the Batskulls) are all
cheap and better than what you have.

> Ear: Shadowbone Earring +2 INT
> Ear: Empty (bleah)

    Batskulls, like you mentioned. Depending on what else you add (and how
close to 200 INT you get), you may prefer Gold Black Sapphire earrings - HP
25 MANA 35. Those two are pretty much standard.

> Chest: Oracle Robe +5 INT, +25 Mana

    Unless something falls into your lap, you're fine here.

> Back: Cloak of Ry'Gorr Oracles +2 INT, +10 Mana

    Fine here.

> Arms: Hollowed Bone Bracers +15 Mana

    Fine here. Cheapish upgrades include Embroidered Black Sleeves (that
Ritualist from above, AC 4 HP 10 MANA 25) and Gatorscale Sleeves (Ac 6 INT 4
HP 15 - the AC in Upper Guk), but I wouldn't go out of my way to get these
things.

> Wrist: PBB +3 INT
> Wrist: Rotbone Bracelet +35 Mana

    Fine here. At lower levels (or if INT is over 200) you may want a Gold
Jaded Bracelet (Ac 2 HP/MANA 15) in place of the PBB - it's player-made.

> Finger: Rose Plat Engagement Ring +4 INT
> Finger: Ring of Frost +3 INT, +10 Mana

    There's a whole bunch of alternatives here. Moonstone Ring (STR 3 MANA
30, booby prize off the Frenzied in LGuk), Jaded Platinum Ring (AC 4 HP/MANA
20, player-made), and the Ring of the Frost Spiders (AC 5 INT/WIS 2 HP/MANA
25 PR 10, one of the spiders in the Frenzied camp in Velk's) should all come
in relatively cheaply.

> Hands: Dusty Bloodstained Gloves +25 Mana

    Excellent. No change.

> Waist: Raw Silk (bleah)

    Ain't many alternatives. Braided Cinch Cord (AC 2 INT 4 HP 8, ghoul sage
in LGuk) is the standard INT-caster belt. Lizardscale Belt (AC 2 HP/MANA 10,
Tae Eew Archon in The Feerott) is a cheap alternative. You could camp the
mutant dregs in Fungus Grove for a Fetid Flesh Belt (AC 6 INT 8 MANA 65 MR
5, random rare drop), but it's the sort of item you could trade for
significant improvements on Jakugg.

> Legs: Raw silk (bleah)

    Also not many alternatives here. White Scaled Leggings (AC 5 INT 2,
random shardwurms in GD), and Black Chitin Leggings (AC 7 HP/MANA 10 - death
beetle in SolB) are about the only two you'll find at a reasonable price
that have any mana on them at all. If you look at the list of pre-Kunark
leggings for wizards you'll see that historically the leg slot was not an
INT source - all their quested leggings, even the legs from Fear had no INT.
So if you find some leggings with some HPs or resists on them that fit, go
with that - there isn't better available.

> Feet: Loam Encrusted Lined Shoes +15 Mana

    Excellent. Stay with this.

> Primary: Stein of Moggok +10 INT

    Excellent. Stay with this.

> Secondary: Skull of Jhen Tra +20 Mana

    Crystal Webshield (AC 15 HP/MANA 20 CR 10, Crystal Caverns) and
Sporestrand Shield (AC 5 INT/WIS 2 MANA 25, Runnyeye) would be alternatives
for cheap. As soon as possible, start the Staff of the Wheel quest (moving
the Stein to offhand). It's the one where you pick up ground spawns from all
over the world - it's INT 10 HP/MANA 10.

> Range: Nothing (bleah)

    I've found the Orb of Echo Ore (HP/MANA 20) on the vendors in Shadow
Haven or the Bazaar fairly often - it drops off a level 40 named in Echo
Caverns. Other things you could try to get are a Dustscryer's Crystal Ball
(INT 2 MANA 30), Student's Homework (INT 3 MANA 15 MR 10), or Teacher's
Syllabus (INT/WIS 3 MANA 20 PR 20). The last two are from the Tower of
Frozen Shadow.

    Another quest to look into would be the Staff of Temperate Flux. This is
considered a standard part of a wizard's arsenal. I mention it here because
it can be used from inventory.

> HP: 372
> AC: 266
> ATK: 111
> (Engrained warrior traits look at stats and screams, faints dead away)

    You'll get over it. :-) Look at the equipment I suggested above, and see
how much of it has zero AC. It's a real paradigm shift. My baby INT casters,
at level 30 with very solid gear and max or near-max DEF, are sitting at
just over 800 HPs self-buffed and between 450 and 500 AC. And there's not a
lot I can do to enhance that (well, the necro is getting my OotIV when I get
my NToV shield, but that's not a common situation).

> STR- 69
> STA- 75
> AGI- 70
> DEX- 83
> WIS- 96
> INT- 174
> CHA- 81

    Figure a way to get AGI to 75, if possible - that's a fairly hefty AC
penalty right there that can otherwise be avoided.

> Resist Poison: 27
> Magic: 45
> Disease: 35
> Heat: 25
> Cold: 40

    Casters like high resists, as spells and AoE attacks are about all that
should ever be hitting them. At lower levels I'm more partial to HPs over
resists, but it depends on what you use to level. Wizards love caster mobs -
low HPs, and they frequently stop pursuing to cast in a magic duel they will
not win.

    Does Ooowump lower OT faction? I know the other ogres on that island do,
but I can't remember if he does. Heh - do you even care about OT faction
now? :-)

    The dynamic duo should be fun. Stick with it at least until 29. Once you
hit 29, you get snare and you can kite all sorts of things. Look on web
sites to find mobs that have low HPs for their level, and go get 'em!
