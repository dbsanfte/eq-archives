Biggest problem I see is that the Win9x platform (includes ME) doesn't
handle the large amount of memory usually intalled in an EQ machine (512mb)
efficiently and you can actually run into problems when you go above 512mb.
It is also relatively unstable so that even if you've got a pretty clean
registry and can reboot quicker than a W2K/XP user then chances are you will
have to reboot more often with 9x.

If you have decent resources to throw at W2K, it absolutely purrs like a
kitten, even for gaming. I use W2K with and Athlon 1.2, 168mb, gf3 ti and an
Audigy card and I have to try to crash the dang thing. I reboot on average
once every week or so out of habit more than any real need to.
