I have several friends that play rogues that have a tough time getting 
groups in the planes.  It's stupid, because rogues have such great DPS, 
but, people just don't seem to get it.  As for necros, I love having a 
necro in the group.  With that 80hp/tick group lifetap, plus fungi plus 
replenishment and my AAs I can canni nonstop until that lifetap wears 
off.  And of course, they can directly transfer mana, as well as add good 
DPS to a fight.
