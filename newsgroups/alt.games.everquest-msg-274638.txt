I have a window that pops up despite my frequent use of the close button. I
have tried remving all filters from it, making sure another window has
"laways chat here" etc. I just don't know how delete this chat window and it
respawns if i hit the "/" key for example. It cannot be killed! I tried
bugging it but they will probably tell me it was designed that way.

Does anyone know if there's a way to edit the ui to kill these pesky pixels?
