Hail,

Just discovered a twist in dmg calculation.

I always thought if you have a weapon, say, 8/20, you put it into ur
primary, amd if you have 8 dmg bonus
then this weap become 16/20.

Well it's actually wrong.
According to an article in monkly business, the base dmg for primary is

weap dmg*2 + bonus

so the compare model is actually

(weap dmg*2 +bonus)/delay  , not  (weap dmg + bonus)/delay

Well, this does make sense, for example, if give a 8/20 weap to a newbie
char who doesn't have any bonus, and mean dmg each hit he can do to mob
is around 16, if you give this weap to a lvl50( 8 bonus dmg ) then he
can hit, on avg, 24 point of dmg.

This change things for me, I underestimated a lot of heavy dmg but slow
weap before.
