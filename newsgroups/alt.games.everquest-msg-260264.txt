But the land is only new to the players. Supposedly the population has
been there for quite some time. Are we really expected to believe that
not one person in the existing population ever got around to mapping
their lands before we got there as players? That's less immersive than
having npc map sellers for instance, at least IMO. They have ridable
griffons and zepplins for god's sake, how can the land be unmapped?

I do agree with you here though. It's a tough choice. They either
have to not put in that content for testing, move it all around before
release, or who knows what else, to stop this. Remember EQ's bugged loot
tables in Kunark expecially because they didn't itemize things until
beta had ended to stop this exact thing from happening. WoW seems to be
holding back their raid content for the same reason. Whether this will
mean it ships as buggy as EQ end zones in new expansions remains to be
seen.
