Talk about different experiences...

My kitty rogue left Shar Vahl and Shadeweavers for Blackburrow at level
10. Several armor slots empty, the rest was patchwork. Rusty weapons only.
No containers in bank slots. Less than a plat to my name. Seemed like
everything that dropped off mobs was No Drop or sold to merchants for a
whopping 2cp. What on earth did you hunt there that was worth so much cash?
Just in case I ever want to again put myself through the newbie hell that
is The Pit in Shar Vahl.
