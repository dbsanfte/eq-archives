This is false.  You only have to have the graphic on for your race and 
gender.

It is irritating to have to put up with this, but not nearly as 
irritating, nay, unplayable, as having to turn on the graphics for both 
genders of all races.

Now it is true that there are some other races you might have to turn 
on, if you are a dark elf, for example, you have to turn on wood elves 
of your gender as well... but I think at worst you need two of the whole 
gamut of "new" graphics.

I currently have on graphics for male trolls, male gnomes, male dwarves, 
and vah shir of both sexes.  I think thats it, I might have an elf 
female or two on because a friend wanted me to see her the same way she 
saw herself, but she's playing vah shir now and I might have remembered 
to go turn it back off.

At any rate, I'm quite certain I don't have new iksar, erudite, 
barbarian, etc. etc. etc., and that I have very few female models turned on.

For one thing, I find the new models vaguely unattractive if not 
disturbing, for another, I really don't care enough about even the 
better looking ones to suffer the performance hit; better the game plays 
good than that it looks good.
