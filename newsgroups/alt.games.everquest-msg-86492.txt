There was an Erudite Necro who agro'd my 48 Paladin on my way to the
Hole the other night, he was very green (my resists are crap and he only
managed to land a single dot on me, I resisted everything else I didn't
interrupt) but he seemed to have both a decent AC and a lot of HPs, took
a ridiculously long time to kill for a mob that could barely scratch me.
I stopped to kill him instead of just zoning because, um, well, because
it's hard enough as a Paladin to ignore NPC Necros and Undead that are
ignoring me, when they have the insolence to agro me, well...
Anyhow, back to the point, I can't see a 45 anything having trouble
getting across the newbie yard to/from the Warrens or Hole.
