Ok, first the obvious answer: what about kiting?

The obvious response is a) the scion is probably very mr (if not
immune to root/snare) and b) they may have some range attack as well.

Dunno. Never seen anyone try to kite a scion. Would be interesting to
see what druid epic plus a couple of winged deaths would do....
