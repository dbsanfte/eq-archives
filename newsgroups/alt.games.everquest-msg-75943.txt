In my case, I have a 15 Dwarf warrior. I use a hatchet/ax in my
primary hand that procs with an Invulnerability ability, which is also
faster than the weapon I assign to the secondary hand.

Ideally, you should assign the weapon with the lowest delay to the
secondary/off hand to allow you to hit more often, but anything that
needs to proc and has a low dely you may want to consider putting in
the primary hand.
