Oddly enough, you've described almost exactly what happened. Except that
I only got ice comet off twice. The first was a partial resist, but
still a fair shot. The second one landed for full. Fay apparently didn't
care for that at all. I'd already taken some AoE damage, so it took Fay
all of, oh.. twentysix and a half milliseconds to kill me.  The other
person to die was also a caster. Not positive, but I believe it was one
of the chanters.
