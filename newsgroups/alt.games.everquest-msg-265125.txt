The software product my company makes occassionally goes into patch
mode.  I can assure you that my patches don't "dork up" anything vital
or important two weeks before the product is due to be released.  This
goes for the rest of the software developers, too.

Good software companies don't let that happen two weeks before launch.

Show stoppers shouldn't happen during late product betas.  Period.  If
a show stopper does happen, something is wrong with the development
process which should be addressed.
