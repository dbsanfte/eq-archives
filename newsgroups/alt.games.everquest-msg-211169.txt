Hi,

next thing should be Spell casting reinforcement for longer duration of 
buffs ... longer duration = lesser need to recast = saved mana

I took Spirit Call 1 too but cant agree that it is very useful... 
damageoutput is marginal ... it looks great but is a bit expensive for 
the look...

The next step for me was "suspend minion" ... one of the best AAs for 
petclasses I think ... Level 1 allows you to "pocket" your current pet 
with the actual HPs and second level even let you recall it with all 
buffs/weapons on it ... While pocketed you can eg go invisible (great if 
invis vanishes and you get agro ... you ll have a tank to call quick) or 
if soloing and your pet dies you have a second one ready to fight... I 
really love this ability and think it is more than worth the 8 points 
for both levels.

"Virulent Paralysis" is very useful too ... a hard-to-resist root (not 
comparable to the spells we get) that also gives a knockback-effect 
(=spellinteruption) that kicks mobs out of meleerange. With level 3 
reusetime and duration should be the same (I only have level 2 now). 
Very useful if you get agro and dont have too much space to move when 
mob is rooted ... And out of my experiences I can say it lasts longer 
than our spells do.

Have fun in game

Christian
