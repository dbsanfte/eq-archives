Um, while it may be more obvious to country folk, there is no point in
denying that death <is> part of life (not pretty much, not sort of, but
<is>).  There are quite a few people who have trouble with that.  They
seem to believe that by ignoring death they can make it go away.  Many
of these same people have terrible trouble with growing older, never
mind the fact that there is only one known way to avoid aging.  As to
the 5-year old and the concept of death, my wife and I have taken care
to gently educate each of our children on the subject of death, it
seems stupid not to given that there is a steady stream of relatives
and friends of the family dying, many of them known to the children.
