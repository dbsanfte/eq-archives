Those tank-less groups can be a blast sometimes (literally). Kinda fun
to kick back and ping-pong kite. Whoever gets top of the hatelist gets
to run around the group like a headless chicken while aggroed instead of
standing getting whacked like a dumb tank, until someone has taunted the
thing off by nuking the crap outta it, then they get run away from it
instead :)  Like a big nuke-relay... doesn't really work indoors though.
