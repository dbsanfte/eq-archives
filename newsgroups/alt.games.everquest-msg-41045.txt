PLEASE, this is an EQ board. half of the messages are about the attack. I am
SURE there is a news message board. If anyone knows the newsgroup for news,
please post it, and post there. People will go there to learn about the news of
the attack, which I am interested in, but the EQ board should have limited OT
posts that direct people to the appropiate place to post. So if anyone knows a
news related newsgroup, please post it to help.
Thank you.
