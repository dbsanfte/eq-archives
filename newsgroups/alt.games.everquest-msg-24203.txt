I take it you are referring to the "Level 25 proccing mob dropped <Velium>
weapons" and not the "Level 1 proccing Velious vendor brought
<Coldain_Velium> weapons"...

*takes a deep breath*

I have seen them being sold occasionally at EC tunnel on Xev, but it is
surprisingly rare. Most people high enough to pick them can't be bother
lugging them back to the old world for the "measly" 5 to 10 plat market
price.
