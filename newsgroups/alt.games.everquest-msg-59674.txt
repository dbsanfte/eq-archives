Oh, I don't know.  I'm looking forward to RvR (considering there's nothing
else to look forward to) but I don't see how - in a few months at the very
most - life in the Frontier will be at all fun for folks not in uberguilds.
You go, you die, no contest.

Of course, that's why I'm looking to join an uberguild...it's not because I
ENJOY being guilded with people with really dumbass names like Fozzie
TheBear and Runforestrun (actual folks on Bev) and d00ds and 133t 13wTz talk
but if I'm going to want to have a chance at actually winning any battle in
RvR I'm going to have to put up with it.  Shit happens, oh well, no biggie.
I've accepted that.  DAOC ain't EQ.

Before any EQ posters respond, I do know that most of the REAL uberguilds on
Zeb, at least, are not d00ds and have at least a few mature players in their
ranks. :)

Totally off this topic but someone posted a couple weeks ago a question in
a.g.daoc about dumbasses in DAOC versus EQ.  I can easily say that the ratio
is damned close between the games.
