Then it's evidently the latter...Troll. Though I know better, I'll
feed ya anyway.

To elaborate, I'll say that I found your original post to be
completely lacking in any supporting facts. All I saw was selfish
whining. You were mad about the nerfs. I get that. Get over it. Adapt,
though there won't really be that much need.

Do you honestly thing that none of the developers actually play the
game and may have a pretty good idea of the affect these changes will
have? They know full well the implications and feel they are necessary
to support upcoming content.

Do you really believe these developers, who also play the game, go out
of their way to degrade the game? What freaking world would that make
any sense in?

I still don't see how any of the changes are so critically bad. Do
they make it impossible for you to continue? Do they make it too
difficult? Enlighten me. Keep your cookie, keep your "drool'o'meter"
and just give me a little sound reasoning.

Rumble <--- likely shouldn't hit the newsgroups with his first cup of
coffee in the morning.
