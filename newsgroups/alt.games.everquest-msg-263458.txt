Yup. Its a Wakizashi of the Frozen North, gives cold damage when
'toon reaches 20th level. Gift from another player in POK. I did a
alt-left click on it, and the description says 'magic item'.

On another server I have some great axe that increases endurance by
+20. Two handed. I think its magic, but I haven't used it recently
and don't remember. The other two magic items I was given are
armour, and the rest are emerald novice warrior stuff I earned.

I guess I really fit the expression 'casual gamer'. I have tried
grouping once so far. But the other person just ran around the zone,
near Qeynos, and hardly communicated at all. I got tired of the lack
of communication after about 15 minutes and ungrouped. My highest
level 'toon is 10th. One out of 14 of them.

I have gotten to where I do screen dumps of just my 'toons' stats
and put them in a spread sheet. Easier to track who has what skill
higher than the rest. And for those looking at super dark
screendumps, I suggest Irfanview to increase the gamma. Much easier
to see them. I use it for my site pngs.

I figure ironic. I saw the smiley. :-)
