Nothing at all has changed since toothless trolls have come here and not
contributed anything.  New people not contributing anything have been
flamed.  No one is walking on eggshells.

Somehow you got out of my KF and I saw a couple posts where you actually
contributed, so for the moment you'll stay out of the KF.

Bottom line:  if you're an asshole you'll be flamed and/or KFed.   Hell,
keep posting to this thread and I don't give a shit if you contribute or
not...you'll be KFed.  I don't give a shit about your opinion of the
regulars.  NO ONE but your little "look at me, I'm a pretend pilot"
newsgroup gives a shit about your opinion of this newsgroup's regulars.

But please, feel free to continue bashing the people most likely to be able
to answer any question you have about the game.  Really.   I mean, I'm sure
that in-game you're bright enough to cuss out 39+ clerics and 29+
enchanters.
