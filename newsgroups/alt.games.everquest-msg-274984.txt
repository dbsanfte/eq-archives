WoW sucks, its a dumbasses guide to MMORPG's

What the problem is people dont want to do ANYTHING that requires thinking 
in their video games anymore

They want to be hand held and led through content, get their Diablo II phat 
lewtz, and call it a night. WoW has no sense of world, no cool lore and 
background, and no sense or team work or purpose. Its a quest generating 
machine there to get you blue items so you can hang out in IronForge at 
level 60 and jump up and down or dance naked.

Its a retarded game for what is becoming every year a more and more retarded 
online MMORPG community.

By all means, take yourself to WoW. Me, i prefer a game where a guild works 
together, advances together, and does need to group.
