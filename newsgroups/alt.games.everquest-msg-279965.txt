Lol. I might be bitching in the hypothetical this time ;)

I hadn't looking over all the alternate access quests, and glancing over 
them now it seems many of them still involve killing a god, which 
prevents guild bootstrapping. 

Whew.

Bitching withdrawn.

That said, I have heard people talking about how they're getting flags 
with one group so they don't need to be 85'd in...I'm not sure what its 
all about now.
