>It's not the class, but how its played...


Of course and contrary to popular belief it is NOT rocket science  playing a
Druid in a group. I mean how may weeks of play does it take for a Druid to
understand that he is not kiting in a group but buffing or healing or evacing? 
Like maybe 10 minutes?

I  think the main reason Druids don't group is because they don't want to and
not that they lack the skills to group. There are always exceptions and, as
someone earlier noted, there are as many irresponsible, ignorant tanks as 
there are casters floating around EQ.
