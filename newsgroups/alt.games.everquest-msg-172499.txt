As I do every year, I'm about to go offline for 3 months.

I've literally stopped playing any computer games except
Everquest.  I enjoy EQ that much, and of course offline games are
all inherantly less interesting because they have smaller
plotlines and there are no "live" people to interact with.

However, once again I'm going to have to fall back on one of
those games.  So I'm looking for suggestions.

The reason I'm asking now is.. well I should have asked sooner.
Last year I did something smart; I bought my "methadone" game in
December, installed it on my machine, and downloaded the patches,
plus looked at some of the discussion on the web about it.  I
swore I'd do that again this year, instead of having to go to the
library and try to download patches onto floppies... where they
often don't fit.  Since the gaming industry no longer releases
working games, hoping to buy something on site, load it up, and
go, with no internet connection, is hopeless.
