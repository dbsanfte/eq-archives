I have actually alwasy thought it was 5 minutes, but due to the pain in 
the butt it is if you tarry too long, I just operate as if I have 3 
minutes, maximum.  If I'm using this, or anyone on my raid is, there will 
be a cleric standing next to the corpse as soon as the <winner> has 
defeated <forgetful_loser> spam hits their screen. 
Can anyone confirm the 5min vs. 10min timer?  If it is 10 minutes though, 
I can get a TON of stuff done in that time.
