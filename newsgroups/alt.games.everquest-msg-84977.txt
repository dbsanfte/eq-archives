No idea, but I worked it out  and it seems that for the 29 more bucks
per month thats 232 more k per month on top of their regular EQ
subscription price (if they get the 8,000 players they want to get)
That equals the salary of 116 people making 2 k per month. Since part
of that cost is not just their salary but the cost to host the web
server just for the char files and calendar for this server alone,
lets say its a lot less than 116 people (and some of them would be
making more than 2k a month) but more like 60 or 70.

It certainly SEEMS like if they had that many people they could hire
just for this server that they could easily have a graveyard shift
presence also. I guess it would totally depend on if they feel enough
people are on. 

If you add it up the money is more than there to go all the way with
this server with 8,000 or more subscribers, its more a question of
will verant really go all the way or count some of the money as
profit. In my ghetto addition above I'm not even including the $9.89
they'd regularly pay.
