Correct.  Someone else has posted details.  Before the first big XP system
change (the one that effectively removed class penalties), the XP was split
like this:

    your share = your XP / total XP of the group members

So, higher level people would get a bigger percentage of the XP, but they
also need more XP to level, and that split exactly balanced that out, so
that everyone would see their XP bar move at the same rate.

When they switched to doing the split based on *level* rather than *XP*, the
effect was that lower level people in the group had their share go up, and
higher level people had their share go down.  However, because higher level
people needed so much more XP, it didn't really noticably make a difference
to the higher level people in a group...but did make a difference to the lower
level people.

With the old system, this was something you *had* to worry about when
getting into an XP group with higher level players.  With the current
system, it is not worth worrying about.  There are almost no circumstances
where you'd want to take or reject a potential group member because of the
XP split.  The best rule of thumb now is simply this: if everyone in the
group is getting XP, the level range of the group is fine.
