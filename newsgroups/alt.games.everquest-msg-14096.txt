Those of you who have always wondered what a d00d is whenever somebody
speaks like a d00d here or refers to one, here's one in his own words
(above link). BTW take note of what he is looking forward to as far as
online game play in the near future and remember what he did in EQ.
He's one more example of why I won't play AO or any other PvP online
game and why I quit UO. This what the moron does on a non-PvP server
and at least got stopped. Imagine a more lax policing policy plus PvP.
