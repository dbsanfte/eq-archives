Song of the Highsun.

I'd be willing to be some mischievous Bard was near your group and was
casting Song of the Highsun on the mobs you were fighting.  Either
that, or you had a Bard in your group casting Highsun when he thought
your casters were in trouble.  I have cast Highsun on low level mobs
in Crushbone and Greater Faydark to confused the newbies and have a
little fun.  I have done it in the past to see if a post like yours
would come up asking, "Since when do Orc Centurions gate when below
20% health?"

If the Bard was in your group, he should have let you all know that he
cast Highsun on the mob in question.
