I did a quick scan here of the subjects and don't see mention of this, did
this happen on all the servers?

My druid was killing reavers and crags in East Karana when a town crier
shouted that the temple guys in Qeynos were cleansing the Karanas and if
anyone wanted to help they should go to the Miller's farm right away.

I went.  Floating here and there in west karana were Braziers of Rodcet
Nife.  They looked like floating cups or upside down helmets.  Anyway, at
the miller's farm was a GM who told us the story of how the Miller's farm
was the only one that would grow stuff, yada yada yada, repeating what was
in the newspapaer bascially.  So anyway, he says form a line and he hands
out bundles of smuding sticks.  We had to go find an brazier and give it the
sticks.  It couldn't be one that already had been given the sticks.  I had
to go all the way over to the pyramid thing and gave it to the brazier on
the pyramid.  I got a band of rodcat nife, AC1 WIS + 2, 1 charge of greater
healing and half a yellow of exp.  I'm level 18.

He picked someone out of the crowd to light one of the braziers and that
would magically light all of the braziers.  Then Karana spoke, never
appeared, and thanked us.  She gave the person who lit the brazier something
but because of all the jerks I never found out what.  Some butt muches
decided it would be a great time to kill the GM.  He thanked those of us
that participated and gated out.  I gated back to EK and killed some more.

The GM was appearing as an NPC named Velarte Selire.

It was fun but a lot of people were complaining that the loot sucked and it
was a lame GM event.  This is the only one I ever participated in and I
think it was great.  I got a neat ring and had an interesting diversion.
And hopefully the xrappy green stuff and the swarmlings are no more.
