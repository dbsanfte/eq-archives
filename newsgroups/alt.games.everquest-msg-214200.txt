   I think that at 36 a cleric *might* be able to solo the undead on the
beach of the Gulf of Guntak.  They are easy to single pull and there
(might want to use pacify or whatever) and there are no wanderers, plus
they don't run or cast.  But they do hit hard.  Dot, root and nuke would
be the plan, being careful not to back into any other mobs.  All the
mobs there, as far as I can tell, are KOS to everyone.  The problem is
that if things go wrong, it isn't very easy to get to a zone line.  I've
tried out swimming mobs to the lighthouse with a skill of 200, but I
still ended up dying (I had several on me).  If you do die in the water,
be careful, the wrecks down there house zombies.  IVU is your friend.
   It is easy to solo there at 44 with new spells, but by then most of
the mobs go lt blue.
