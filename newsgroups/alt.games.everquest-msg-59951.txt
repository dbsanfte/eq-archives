Apparently, here's what's going on.  Verant changed the encryption and
the packet format in a recent patch, making it so ShowEQ does not show
spawn data.

The ShowEQ developers have a fix, and it was briefly distributed, then
they pulled it.  They apparently believe that this is the new
encryption for Luclin, and they (the ShowEQ developers) have decided
that they do NOT want ShowEQ fully functional when Luclin comes out,
so that people won't be able to use ShowEQ to quickly find out all the
new stuff.  They have said that they will wait two weeks or so after
Luclin is out, and then release a fix to make ShowEQ fully functional.

Until then, all you get with ShowEQ is the automap (e.g., the map of
the zone you are in, with your position shown).

Some people are really ticked off at the ShowEQ developers.  I believe
"Ratt" is one of those developers.
