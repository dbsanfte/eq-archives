What would be cool would be to have servers with the same names, *and* have
a series of events leading up to the EQ2 launch that, on each server, change
the corresponding EQ2 world.  For example, using an existing event, if any
servers have not woken the Sleeper at EQ2 launch time, the corresponding EQ2
server should start with the Sleeper still asleep.

Or, instead of having the corrupt faction dominant in Freeport on all EQ2
servers, have open civil war break out in Freeport on the EQ1 servers, with
the players able to take sides and affect the outcome (kind of like the Ring
war events in Velious).  If the corrupt guards win on an EQ1 server, they
will be in power on the corresponding EQ2 server.  If the corrupt guards
lose on an EQ1 server, the corresponding EQ2 Freeport will be like it is
now.
