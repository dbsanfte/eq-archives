Clue time, the fact that you got to 56 and only died 3 or 4 times
isn't exactly something to be proud of. It translates to: "look at me,
I took the easiest and safest route to high lvl that I could find, so
now I'm an expert."

Please delete your shaman and start a druid, preferably a halfling.
You have the right attitude for one.

I know you'll find this hard to believe but there's actually some
spots in EQ where you can't gate out and be back in 5 minutes.

Better than 2:1 actually

Please tell me that was meant as a joke. But on the off chance that
you really are that clueless and furthermore that you're actually
capabale of learning, here's some math. 

Regrowth - 15 hp per tick
Ikky BP    - 5 hp per tick
Standing regen for a high 50s shaman around 5. 

15+5+5 = 25 regen per tick at a minimum, which translates into around
15 free mana per tick when you cannidance. Replace that ikky BP with a
fungi and you'r at over 20 mana per tick. Doesn't work all the time of
course since you're not always at full hitpoints but the general jist
of this should be obvious to someone of your *cough* intelligence. 

Now for some advanced math. 
140hp = 81 mana 	- cann4
400 mana = 2000hp   	- Kragg's Mending
200 mana = 1200hp 	- Torpor

<--- wonders if the light bulb is starting to go off but betting
against it

Sigh, I just know that Martin is gonna bring you up every time he
argues that removing the PoP flags is a really bad thing.
