I wish to describe to you the problem EQ is having on my computer that I 
will describe as a "routine file corruption problem".  This problem has 
followed me for about two years.

EQ is stable as long as I stay within a zone but with every zone it 
becomes increasingly unstable to the point that I zone crash or the 
client quits leaving me at the desktop after a while in the zone.  If I 
restart EQ it then often, though not always, wishes to redownload a file 
that was apparently corrupted (e.g., eqgame.ex_, spdat.ef_, or other).  
I feel the file reloading tidbit is what will best help you diagnose my 
problem since it appears to be unique among problems here.

Oddly enough this same exact problem has followed me across several 
fresh installs of Win95, Win98, Win2000, and different combinations of 
motherboards, CPUS (always AMD though), video cards, sound cards, 
memory, newest drivers of all, etc.  Yet the problem remains.  Like most 
people it is just EQ that has any problem at all on my computer.

My current configuration is Windows 2000 fresh install, Directx 8.0, 
service pack 2, an ASUS motherboard (forget the number) with AMD Duron 
800Mhz, 256Mb 100Mhz RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 2MX AGP 4X.  Fast writes are 
enabled (vid card supports it, also tried turning fast writes off -- did 
not help).  I have all major devices on a separate IRQ, only Network 
card and USB share same IRQ (system forces that no matter how I choose 
the network card IRQ).

I love EQ but this is driving me nutty and really ruining my fun.
