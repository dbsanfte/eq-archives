Look again...

I don't think that's an automap, I think that's
a map of all the zones, with simply an indicator of
who's in what zones at the moment, and highlighting
all of the zones you've visited since you last
pressed the "clear map" button.

I.e., it's a graphical "/who all GUILD", and a
"I have visited zones X Y and Z" list (which you
could do yourself with a zone list and a magic marker).

For an added chuckle, look real hard at the "zone map"
page of the "EQ Legends" marketing web page.  The
map, taken from screenshots and presumably from
Verant's own in-house test version of the map feature,
has "Cabilis" spelled wrong (as "Cabalis").
