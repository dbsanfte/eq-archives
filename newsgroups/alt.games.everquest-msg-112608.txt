You guys forgetting that the first batch of celerons are missing the L2,
only at a later date that they released a celeron with L2 cache called
celeron 300A and 333A. If your processor doesn't post on bios detection
screen with an A at the end, than you only have 64k L1 cache and no L2 cache
what so ever.
