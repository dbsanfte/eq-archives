http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/itemsearch.html

you can narrow by class, race, slot, level and stat all at the same time.
and exclude velious or kunark items if you don't have the expansions, and
exclude planar, no drop and crafted items if you don't want these types for
whatever reason (can't go to the planes until you're level 46 anyway...)

though some items don't have a level rating and will show up even though you
can't attain them at your level...nothing's perfect.
