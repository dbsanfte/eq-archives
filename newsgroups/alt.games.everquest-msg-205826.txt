As a 62 druid, you may be able to do NG in OS solo. The bugs drop
planar-level gems and an occasional, sellable item. The high-level
mages and shamans in my guild can easily net 10k in a day there.

You should also be able to solo in Nurga (at least until they upgrade
it.) Besides the cash drops, salts and skins that drop there sell on
most servers for 500-1000 a stack.
