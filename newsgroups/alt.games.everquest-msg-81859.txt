This is not verified but seems plausible enough:

I just grabbed this from bahters posting on Graffs site....

Before this one gets too far out of hand, I wanted to mention something:

After seeing this thread lastnight, I talked to the GM in question as well
as one of the Lead GMs.

We all agree that this isn't Sir Bahter's fault, and that the "more correct"
solution is to add a switch that allows GMs to turn titles on and off. Any
name changes due to this, until that point, are only temporary.

(This is a feature that we would really like to add in for players as well,
but the two gentlemen who'd be doing that are both handling
engine/zoning/memory optimizations and drops to desktop at this point, which
have to take priority. Unfortunately, it's a more involved change than one
might think.)

Please don't be too hard on the GMs - They're doing their jobs, and quite
well at that. If anything, it's a failing on our side that the need for a
switch like this wasn't forseen when we started adding things in front of
people's names.

I'm definitely not comfortable with any change we make that forces a need
for a person to lose, even temporarily, an identity he's had for quite some
time. That's just not fair. We'll find a way get the switch added in the
next couple weeks.

Best,
