Hi, All

My friend, who has 2 near-identical PC's is getting the infamous
"unable to access eqmain.dll" error when trying to log into the game
on Number 2 PC.  He has the same, EQ-supported (according to the EQ
tech pages) graphics card in each machine, and the latest
(EQ-supported) drivers installed on both machines.  He has tried the
solutions on the help pages at Sony, such as changing the screen to
16-bit colour, as well as deleting the suggested files, then updating.
He has even tried a full reinstall of the entire game and expansions
and downloading all the files required by Sony.

Nothing fixed it.  I have trawled the web, seen plenty of people who
have had this problem but, sadly, no solution so far.

His No 1 PC plays the game fine.  No. 2 PC has a different motherboard
but is otherwise identical, and I have a gut feeling that this
particular graphic card  + this motherboard just clash somehow.  Could
this be at all likely?  It doesn't seem plausible, but that's what it
looks like...

If this is the case, it will be a shame as he just upgraded the card
in his No. 2 PC in order to allow me to play the game using my own
account while he plays on No. 1 PC using his account!  It looks like
our joint gaming sessions are a goner  :D

Any advice greatly appreciated  :)
