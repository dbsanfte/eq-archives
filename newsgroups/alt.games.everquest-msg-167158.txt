True. The supply is limited only by the amount on hand at any given
time. What typical RL example doesn't have the same restriction?
Carrots? They will be grown every season. You are only limited to the
quantity available each season. In EQ it is the same scenario, only
the season is quite a bit shorter. You buy all the bone chips in the
bazaar? There will be more there later. You buy all the carrots in the
world? There will be more later.

I can really only think of two cases of animals in RL coming close to
extinction due to being killed for resources, whales and certain
elephants as I understand it. This is hardly representative of all the
animals killed for human use.

Seems to me that if this were the case, I would see Centi LSs selling
in much higher numbers for much less. However, the supply is not
nearly as quickly replenished.

There *is* a finite number of customers as well as a finite amount of
resources available at any given time - at least in so much that there
is in RL. It's closer to RL capitalism than you will admit.
