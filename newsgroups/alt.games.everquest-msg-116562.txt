Bard - claim PnP and be shunned
Seb - ditto
AC - if you aren't pharming; the person who PnP'd you would be shunned.

If I AM pharming PnP never comes into play...if an xp group comes along I
leave.  If I'm in SolA farming items and someone calls a camp check, I reply
that I'm camping <whatever> until an xp group comes along. *shrug*  Lots to
do in this game to make cash without taking away from the enjoyment of
others.
