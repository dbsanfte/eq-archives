That's often one of the harder things to do, so you're not doing too
badly.

>I went out into the newbie area and got my butt kicked.

That will happen, especially as a newbie - at first and second level,
nearly everything is as tough as you or tougher. Sometimes you just
have to run to guards.

I get the feeling you're mostly having trouble with the interface and
mechanics aspects - it isn't supposed to be all that hard. An
experienced player, starting a new character, can get through the
first few levels in an hour or two.

In another reply Leo wrote about the /con system - it's important to
learn how to use this when starting out. Generally speaking, you won't
want to attack stuff that cons higher than white (or black, depending
on which screen setup you're using), which means it's more or less
equal to your strength. Later, when you group with other players,
you'll be able to take on tougher stuff.

>Where can I get some cash? 

I had this exact same problem when I started playing.

Cash is gotten through looting. For example, if you kill an orc pawn,
when you loot its corpse you'll get a few pieces of copper. These will
automatically get placed in your inventory. The orc pawn (or whatever
else you kill) may also have some other items that you can loot. Keep
these, and when you get several go to one of the many merchant or
shopkeeper NPCs in the newbie areas. Click on the merchant, and you'll
be presented with a buy/sell screen. Sell all the loot you collect.

Also, many of the newbies around you will be twinks - that is, they'll
be low level characters, but may be funded by high level characters.
This works to your advantage, because these folks will consider most
of the loot to be just trash, and they won't take it. Try looting
every monster corpse you see - you'll be surprised how much extra
money you can make this way.

Don't despair about the people you see selling stuff for hundreds of
plat when you only have a few dozen coppers - the game is very well
balanced in terms of the cash you'll earn vs the cash you'll need at
low levels. You'll have plenty of time to be rich later on.

>Every time I die every copper piece disappears and I'm out of luck.

Until you learn your way around, pay close attention to where you are
all the time. This way, when you die you'll be able to find your own
corpse and loot your own stuff from it. This way you won't ever lose
your money or other stuff. At low levels you have a fairly short time
to get your loot - around half an hour - so don't dawdle!

>It's getting extremely frustrating...please help.

It is frustrating until you get the hang of the game mechanics. After
that you'll find it very rewarding. Stick with it.
