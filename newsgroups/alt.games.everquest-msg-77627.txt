    Prices will drop on things that are obsolete or behind the average power
curve on the server. Staples and current power level items will maintain
value.

    This isn't always the case. There's at least one item I'm looking for
(Ceremonial Smudging Stick) that I have only ever seen in EC once since SoL
came out. And that one was snapped up by somebody else for 6 K, which if you
look at the stats on the Stick (AC 3 WIS 3 MANA 30 FR/MR/PR 10 ranged slot)
is fairly out of line. You have to consider demand.

    Again, not always. If someone else is selling for what I feel is a cheap
price, I'll buy his and sell it for a profit - he can't refuse to sell to me
to stop this practice when he's in Vendor mode. (It happens a lot on my
server with top-end tailoring gear, and the top-end tailor will refuse to
sell to anyone he's witnessed reselling his wares.) Or, if I feel demand
outstrips the supply of the item in the bazaar, I'll set my price
independent of the other prices, as eventually someone will be forced to buy
from me when the others are out-of-stock. Remember, with a vendor there's no
pressure to "get out of EC and do something useful", so there's no pressure
to artificially lower prices to sell fast.

    Tradeskillers mostly make gear on commission - if they don't, they
usually get stuck with stuff they can't move. The jewel crafters I know, for
example, will auction "WTS Velium Fire Opal Rings, two for 750 pp!", but
don't have any Velium Fire Opal Rings on them at the time - just Fire Opals
and Enchanted Velium Bars, ready to make what they can sell that day. I'm
sure some tradeskillers will put their wares up overnight and get some
success out of it, but my gut instinct tells me to not overstock inventory
and do the vendor thing. I also don't like the loss of upsell potential from
losing interaction time with customers - "Oh, you want X? I can also make Y,
which is similar or better for the same purpose, and I have related products
A, B, and C available! Free gnome cookie with every purchase!"

> plate and banded,

    Then they'd be crazy. Especially since one of the biggest profit
opportunities with fine plate is the dyeing. If you set up shop as a vendor,
what do you stock - one of each piece of each size, do you try and guess
what the "hot" sizes/pieces are, do you go undyed or dyed? That's a lot of
possible inventory, and you don't want cash tied up in inventory. They would
be a lot better off being in the Bazaar in person, /auctioning as per usual,
and taking trade-in items instead of cash for pieces where there's an
opportunity for profit. Then vendor the trade-ins overnight, since there may
not be synergy between the trade-ins and your normal business (no upsell
opportunities based on facetime).

    Depends on the common mob drop. I agree that things that are out-of-date
won't be sold well - Fine Steel weapons will not sell well on PC vendors,
for example, because better exists in vast quantities. But there's a LOT of
intermediate items that would work nicely in this model.

    Example: Kunzar Cloak, AC 7 INT/WIS 2 FR 10 and lightweight. A very nice
low to mid-level cloak for a LOT of classes, I usually see them on vendors
for the vendor price (800 pp or so IIRC). People trying to sell them in EC
soon realize there's a fair number of them out there, get frustrated that
they can't sell them fast at the price they think would be fair for a
Karnor's drop, and vendor them for 50 pp or so. Do you think that lower
level characters would snap these up at 150 pp, if they could find them for
that? I *know* they would - and it would be a great price to PC vendor them
at. Overnight, someone's going to walk by, see that cloak, say "great twink
gear/nice cloak for me!" and it'll sell. When I sold a friend's collection
of junk (and we're talking over 120 items he'd farmed/collected over the
course of a few months), the fastest sellers were the small 50 pp caster
trinkets, like Obsidian Bead Hoops. Individual items, I could not predict
when they'd sell, but taken as a collective, they sold FAST.

    People have said this before, and I still have yet to see it.
Tradeskillers still sell items, they only sell the most upscale items now
(and there's no sign that Verant will stop creating new, more upscale
recipes). Items pulled from dungeons still get sold in EC, or for the
impatient/obsolete to NPC vendors. The only tangible effect of the "economy"
that people don't like is the increase in power over time of low-level
characters (through twinking and trading).
