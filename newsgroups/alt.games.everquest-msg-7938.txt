As has often been observed, different people have different lifestyles, income
levels, etc.  None better or worse, just different.  It might be worth
considering that if you are in a financial situation where either 30-60 dollars
for a software package, or ten dollars per month for an online game service is
"a lot of money" to you, then this might not be the ideal choice of hobby.
   A good friend of ours is totally in love with the idea of EQ and even created
a character on my account one night to try it out for a while. We bought him the
game for christmas. He still isn't signed up and playing because he's out of
work right now and really strapped for cash.
  Just a thought.
