You can always hotkey 2 songs at a time.  Sure, you're kinda locked in to
those songs and missed notes or interruptions can kill one or boths songs
but it will cut your clicking in half, at the least.

I think a good test of whether or not bards really mind the constant
clicking will be watching the new non-transfer server that just opened.  I
was stunned at the number of newbie bards in and around the Freeport and
Kelethin areas.  If bards start to become a little bit rare, like they seem
to be on many servers, then it could mean the majority of the newbie bards
didn't know how tough it is to properly play a bard, which includes
continual clicking.
