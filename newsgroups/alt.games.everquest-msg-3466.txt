Shared this thread with a friend last night who told his own "you've been
playing too long" dream... trying to cook dinner for his family by placing food
in the oven, pressing a button, then opening the oven to see if it was soup
yet. He started to panic when five attempts in a row failed, he was running low
on roasts and the baby had started crying. Things got weird after that when a
gnoll walked through his kitchen walls, ignored the NPC children and started
hitting him.
