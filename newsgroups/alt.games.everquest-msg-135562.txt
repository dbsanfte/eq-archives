Lokisoft failed so putting games on linux takes a step backwards.
The few linux games you see at a software etc linger there forever.
It isn't that a developer is saying, "Hey if I did this I could put
the game on linux!" but more like he is saying, "Why?"

Besides that verant is hacker paranoid and wants EQ to control
the desktop. You can't have a program do that in Linux really and
the 12 people playing EQ in linux would have window programs out in a
day.

Even putting everquest on the mac might fail. If it generates 200,000
mac users to the current 500,000 win users, it would be a huge
success. If 230 mac users bought it then verant and every other mmorpg
maker will say, "Mac, why bother?"

Software sells an OS and legitimizes it in the same way that software
sells a console. This is especially a problem for Linux because so
much of the software is free. Being free and open is great until
someone wants installed desktop figures OR you want someone to BUY
something to run under the OS. Being the user of a mostly free OS that
people hack around in a lot is just not something that a game company
sees as a good market.
