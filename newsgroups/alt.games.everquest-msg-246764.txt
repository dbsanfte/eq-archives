I have never said it makes the Nvidia cards obsolete or unusable.  I
have said that IF repeat IF SOE implement the DX9.0 standard you guys
will notice a difference in frame rates (significant).  If they go for
a hybrid version of DX9 you may be ok but why go for a hybrid and have
your games not look as nice as they can?

Sorry if I sound like that not trying to ... just stating facts. The
proof will be in the pudding when SOE, implement the next round of
changes.  But as I have said why go for a part implementation of DX9,
that would make no sense at all?
