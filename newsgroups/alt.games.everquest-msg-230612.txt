Armor still makes a difference in BoT.  Mobs in the high 50s and low 60s. 
Armor doesn't seem to make a difference in Tactics, but speaking from the
viewpoint of a monk, the mobs there probably have high enough atk that the
pet can't hit the break even point (the lower end "soft" cap).  The 500 hp
belt always helps.  :)

As the armor given to a pet will be straight mitigation increase, the earth
pet will see the biggest percentage benefit.  Seems a likely logical
conclusion.
