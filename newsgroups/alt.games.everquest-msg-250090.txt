Hello DX 9 issues...   should be #1 on any "to do list" concerning this
game.  Targeting (though we did get a useful feature workaround -- not a
fix), wall issues, "sticky" issues, lockup issues, affect everything and
everyone and should be fixed (not "fixed") first.

But I see there's a further list.  It must be on that one...

Oh that is so sad...
