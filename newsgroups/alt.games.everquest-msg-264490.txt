Yup.  Imagine if in Lord of the Rings, when they went through the Mines of
Moria, if instead of it being a terrifying run through danger, they had
simply entered, Gandalf had shouted "camp check!", noted the responses
("Balrog!", "Stone Bridge!", "Cave Troll!", etc.), and said "OK, it's safe
to go through...everything dangerous is camped" and they had just walked on
through.  Geesh!

There are places in an MMORPG where it should just be you and your party and
a bunch of nasty mobs.  I can only think of two ways to get that:

    1. Instancing

    2. Have such a big world that other parties simply usually end up
    somewhere else

The problem with #2 is that no one seems to have time to design such a big
world by hand, and computer-generated dungeons and zones have so far been
unsatisfactory.

Perhaps the thing to do is have the following:

    1. Have some single-party instanced dungeons, but restrict them somehow.
    Maybe you have to do a quest to get in, or you have to have something
    that drops off mobs.  (The idea here is to make it so people don't spend
    all their time in the instanced dungeons, to avoid the problem Ben
    Sisson has with instanced dungeons).

    2. Have some large dungeons designed to handle several parties at once.
    They should be designed so that single parties can do stuff in them, but
    have some things that several parties can work together on.
