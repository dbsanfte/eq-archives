Im starting to hate spell research
A lot of the runes are hard to find and by the time ive found them im 
ready for my next set of research spells and need a new set of runes.
If im lucky someone might be selling them at the bazaar but i dont like 
just bying them, id rather have to kill something and be get the rune 
dropped occasionally.
And then when you do finally get the rune you often fail to create it 
and the rune is wasted!
Some runes seem more common than others.
Ive had a zillion falahem runes but during my time killing in the 
karanas from 16 to 22 i have yet to see the rune of karana!
Ive been spending trains on research to get them up so i fail less and 
am around 50 now in it
I know i can do the practise research stuff but gathering all the items, 
some of which dont stack, is a hassle.
When i sucessfully create a complete practise rune arent i meant to 
increase my skill in research?
I made 20 practise of each and then got many complete runes back to sell 
but my research skill didnt go up at all.
Is this because these runes are now trivial for me and i need to move 
onto the next stage before i will gain?
Also can anyone let me into any secrets as to how i can virtually 
guaranteee not to waste the rare runes i find.
What level of research is needed to virtually guarantee that you will 
sucessfully create the scroll? is it 100?
Or is it relative to the scroll you are trying to recreate?
Like if i have 2 runes for a level 50 spell and im only level 27, 
because the spell is higher than my level would i automagically fail?
Or will i be able to create it but just not use it to level 50?
Any insights anyone can give me into research would be most appreciated 
as i am just about ready not to bother without any of the research 
spells and just get shop bought/npc drop ones
