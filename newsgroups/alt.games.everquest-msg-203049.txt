<<<<<<<<<<<ou've been answered many times.   KEI on low levels adversely
affects the
game experience since it interferes with natural selection. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

It interferes with natural selection?  What the hell does that mean?
<<<<<<Sans KEI,
talentless hacks such as yourself would have become bored with the
"unreasonably high downtime," and left long ago. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I've been playing the game a long time before KEI came around and I didn't have
any problems so I guess I must not be lacking that much talent or be that much
of a hack.  Do you really think playing this game requires talent?  Here's a
bit of news for you, anyone can make it to level 65 all it takes is time.  The
game is not that hard.  It's time consuming, but not hard. 


<<<<<<<<<   That downtime is
mitigated, and often completely avoidable by use of good grouping skills.

Again you act as if you have skills that I don't just because I liked having
KEI.  Simple fact is that I've got all the same"skills" you do but I liked the
action that having KEI let you have.  I don't have time to be sitting on my ass
doing nothing.  You do apparently.
