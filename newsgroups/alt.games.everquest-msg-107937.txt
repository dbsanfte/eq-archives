 1.2k is pretty good for improved camo. It's not that common of a spell
unless you spend all your time in Velks or GD. I've never had the sirens
at the SG tunnel see through invis. They are green but don't let that
fool you. They seem to do really well with their spells and can nuke you
down fast. Not to mention charming you which is bad.
