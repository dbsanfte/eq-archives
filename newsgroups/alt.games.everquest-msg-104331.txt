The gnome in the estate of unrest drops a bag with weight reduction on it,
is this true or just rumors/lies?

If anyones wondering its the gnome under the water fall/slant near the hut
and backdoor.

He spawns every 12 mins (ish) and you dont take any faction hits for killing
him, does he have hidden faction? And does he drop that bag?

Thanks in advance!
