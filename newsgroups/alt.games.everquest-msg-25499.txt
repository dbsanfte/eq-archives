#1 is "incoming".  The puller is bringing the mob to the kill group of
casters and warriors.  This is especially important to the casters, who are
literally reading their spell books to regain mana.  While doing so they
generally have little perception of what is going on around their character
while medding.  I can't tell you how many times I have started to med with
people close, get up and they are long gone.

The life of a caster is moments of sheer action and long periods of boredom
while reloading the mana that is used in seconds.  I have been thinking that
perhaps two mages in a group could take turns fighting and medding, thereby
providing a more even game flow for the warrior and other non-magic
characters.
