As I mentioned in my original quote, I have checked out the recipes on
www.eqtraders.com.  I find the materials on EQ Traders on enchanted fine
plate to be confusing at best.  The recipes for making fine steel and fine
plate are not what I am asking about.  I am asking about the recipes for
making enchanted FP.  For example, it is implied on EQ Traders that one can
have a high level enchanter make enchanted ore and then use the same recipes
as for the regular fine plate armor.  Clearly this is not literally true
since there is a difference between HQ and MQ..
