Back a long time ago, we killed that elemental in umbral planes with our 
guild, and some guest ninja looted an item.
We petitioned but it did no good. We then started making it public, who he 
was, and that he was a nija looter, and we got warned instead!
They are about protecting ninja looters (read: keep them paying their subs, 
cos money>all)
