From the shadows, the mysterious "James Grahame"
<jamesgrahame@shaw.ca> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

A lot of players aren't nearly as good as they think they are. They
got into a comfort zone with their guildies and can play well with
*them*, but put them in a situation where they have to adapt to people
they don't know and they fall apart to a level you don't usually see
outside of highkeep.

That's a lot more common than I think people would like to admit.

As for their flagging, that means jack. I said before, 90% of people
in any guild have no real skill whatsoever, other than the ability to
follow orders, and more or less just get their flags because they've
been playing that long or that much and managed to show up on time.
Seeing elemental or time equipped players fuck up is no surprise to
me.
