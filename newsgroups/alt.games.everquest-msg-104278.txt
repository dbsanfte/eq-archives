Yes, twice. Once on a level 9 and once on a 14. Its even easier now
since the no rent items (like the rapier) last half an hour even if
the character is logged out.

Just to be sure I had the other character also have the rapier. My
druid dropped the rapier and 3250 or whatever gold pieces on the
ground, other char logged in and got (course you can't drop money
now), hailed hasten with druid and then logged in other char to same
location. Sat druid down hailed again, gave ac ring continued to hail
while camping. Other char got in and gave rapier and money and got
jboots.
