You're not into it........ ok..... and you're playing it why, again?

Well, then your character should never die either, by that logic. Maybe
we could just start you at level sixty in "God Mode".

Please explain the logic underlying that statement? A "design decision"?
Like it was required in the code? But for some magical reason when you
hit level 35 it's no *longer* required in the code that you look at the
book? Pleeeeeeeeeease. Total bullshit. It was designed in for
roleplaying purposes, to illustrate that casters have to learn to
meditate effectively over a long hard road. Deal. Or not, as you've
apparently chosen to, by playing non casters. Others still seem to play
casters. I'd say you're in the vast minority. Nobody likes it, but it's
part of the experience.

Great answer. <snip more "design decision" nonsense>

Yes, I'm sure you wouldn't, because you only see it as an inconvenience
to making the game "easier" for you. Not as part of the immersion into
the playing of the character you chose.

*That* was a design decision. Nothing roleplaying about it. No idea why
it was implemented originally, and even less idea why they removed it.
Apples and oarnges.

And you're welcome to. Of course, it's part of the game, and you're
always free to play Tomb Raider or something where, if you don't like
the game environment, you can hack into "God Mode" and change it. EQ
isn't like that, and I hope they don't give into the whingers on this
and change it to boost sales, etc.

Hello? Is this on? Who says you have to sit down and med if you want to
"see all the pretty graphics"? You can stand up, look at them to your
heart's content, and regain mana slower? What exactly are you arguing
about again?

*shrug* You say "boring the player". Most of us say "Playing the
character". Your choice.

The new changes do rock for the most part, hardware concerns aside.
