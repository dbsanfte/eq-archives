Still waiting for my refund...They currently owe me �1.43
They seem to be ignoring my emails now but I will persevere.

Public holiday on Monday and Tuesday coming (in celebration because some old
biddy has managed to go 50years without working and under state support or
something) bet they move the patch from Wednesday to Tuesday, now :�)
Actually don't really care, if the weather is as good as they say it will be
(Which for the UK means not raining) I won't be in anyway.
