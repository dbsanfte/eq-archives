From the shadows, the mysterious "Geminii" <geminii_guy@hotmail.com>
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>last night on the Vaz server, no one could cast any spells. I was in Velks
>with a group.
>almost lost it on a slight over pull. But tanks were able to whip spider ass
>with out cleric and enchanter (me).
>Did any other servers experience this. Had never seen this happen before.
