Yanno, tonight I started a dark elf (had to start on a new server though 
:) I'm out of room on TM) and what was the name the random generator gave 
me?  Taelr.

...

Okay, I'll go with that :D  It got rejected though, so I tried again.  I 
can't even remember how to SPELL it now, but it gave me ANOTHER version 
of "Tailor".  Celaeno might know. *leers at Celaeno*  Just wait till I 
get out of Neriak, baby.  Well, if I can find the rogue guild.  I found 
out it wasn't my guild I was looking at - the whole damn TOWN looks like 
a strip joint.
