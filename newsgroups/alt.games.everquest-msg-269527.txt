Please don't toppost here.

I've gone over 200 combines sometimes without a skillup with a wisdom of 
255 at the time.

You are about twice as likely to get a skillup on a successful combine as 
you are on a failed combine, so, using a skill enhancing item is almost 
always a good idea, unless it reduces your primary stat too much to equip 
it.
