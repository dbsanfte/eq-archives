Its called Fraud. 
Verant nerfed basically all such ways to to make much money.

However, you said you are level 23 and there is a way that works
fairly well but is also not super fast:

www.eqtraders.com if have recipe questions:

Make a skinning knife, I made on a newb in 5 tries after adding 3
points to smithing.

Get a sewing kit.

Kill every spiderling you see, every wolf, every bear, every kitty.
Take high and medium skins and skin them to low (cept save high
quality bear to sell to players for like 30 plat or more)

Combine 2 spiderling silk in sewing kit, raises tailoring enough
pretty fast so you don't fail much. Take silk thread combine with low
qual pelt = leather padding.

Sell leather padding to players for 80 plat or more per stack (give or
take a bit depending on server)

This is really even better to do before 23 when such things are XP.
You could go to somewhere like stonebrunt mountains where you might
still get XP while getting hides.

Preferrable shortcut ESPECIALLY if you are non kos in neriak:

Vendor delve and BUY all the low qual, med qual or high qual pelts
they have that work and all the spiderling silks they have.

The way you vendor delve can really be cheap, just look at a vendor
and if they have ALL the player sold slots filed with crap buy out all
the crap they have that is player sold and cheap like snake fangs.
Then esc and reclick on the vendor, something previously unseen will
fill the slot.

This (trade skill supplier)  is the most legit and probably largest
money maker in the game for how easy it is until you are doing pretty
high end mobs that drop a lot of cash or gems. I did a test and made,
of all characters, an ogre sk on a server I had zero characters on to
test this. By the time ogre sk was level 6 I had it bound in freeport
east where it could train (nice player did it for 2 plat I made), had
it all in storebought leather, had it vendor delving and had 45
leather paddings to sell. I financed most of that by running carefully
around mtn rathe killing what bears I could until I got a high qual
bear pelt and sold to a passing troll tailor in ogguk for 40 plat.

FYI, nice thing for ogres now is since a recent patch there are BEARS
IN FEEROOT!!!  Fun ;)

The reason this leather padding is fairly lucrative is its time
consuming so fine plate smiths would rather buy it in bulk AND you
will get some high quality bear hides you can sell for 30 plat or more
to players. 

Hint: you are far more apt to make large amounts of money fast with
the leather padding once you are rolling by buying out vendors to make
the padding. The best bet is neriak on various vendors in the first
zone or GFAY on the first couple vendors by the newb lift. Best time
is a couple weeks after the last patch. Problem: lately with luclin
they patch far too often to find much.
