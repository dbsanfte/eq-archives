i had a similar problem i had the dx8.1 installed but it still didnt work so
i reinstalled 8.1 and reinstalled my video card drivers and now everything
is completly back to normal also dont forget you should be able to restore
your computer back to a earlier time and that usually fixes software
conflics i hope this helps. Demagos 25 Troll sk -The Tribual
