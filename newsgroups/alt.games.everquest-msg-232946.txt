Shared IRQs are common and normal, and in fact difficult (and 
unneccessary) to avoid, in the era of Windows XP.

If its happening in any game, it could be a defective video card, with a 
defect that is only apparent when it makes use of some advanced hardware 
accelleration.  It could be a buggered Windows, or DirectX install... 
you could reinstall windows from scratch...

One thing to try, in any case, but particularly if you are using an LCD 
screen and intel onboard video: try dropping your video hardware 
acceleration to off and running the games... if it works, edge it back 
up slowly until it crashes again.

If that's the problem, it could be a defective board, (or in the case of 
the intel + LCD combo a piss-poor chipset... buy a proper video card and 
disable the onboard). Or live with the reduced hardware acceleration... 
it may or may not be a noticable problem depending on how much you had 
to drop it and what chipset you are running.
