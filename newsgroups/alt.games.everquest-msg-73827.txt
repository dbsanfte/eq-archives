Why?
Cobalt Gaunts are ridiculously easy to obtain these days.  They cost
about 1 to 2k at most.  At level 35, it's definately possible to
gather together that much money to buy a pair.  They are also AC25
which means you aren't getting any better AC armor for a while.

BTW, don't for a moment think twinking will make someone "ultra
powerful".  The game is too level centric for that to happen.

At 42/43?  I doubt it.
Cobalt boots are off the Drolvgar Captain in Karnor.  He's a level 48
mob and surround with mobs that will con white to red to you.

As a level 42/43 tank, you won't be tanking much in Karnor.

Cobalt arms are from Seb, random off any of the froggies.  They will
be similar leveled to the captain and many will be 50+.

Cobalt bracers and helm are off reets.  These are level 55 frogs in
Seb mixed in with level 57 golems and level 55 shrooms.

Cobalt legs are off VS and BP off Trakanon.

Quit worrying about twinking.  Twinking was never as serious a problem
as many would have you think.  It's only a problem to those who let it
bother them.  In most cases, even the most outrageously twinked
character was nothing more than just funny (from the sheer silliness
of the items in question) than anything else:  Level 20 warrior in
full cobalt dualing a pair of SoDs and using a Cowl of Mortality.  Now
*THAT* is twinking to the extreme.
