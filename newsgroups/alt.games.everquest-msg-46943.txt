  I have it happen.  I get a memory reference error when it does.  It's the
reason I've started banking a lot more in Freeport than in Neriak with my DE
Necro.
  One thing I do, that seems to help most of the time, is to *walk*.  And
take off any SoW, Jboots, or other speed increasing things like that.  It
still does it occassionally, but I can almost guarantee to make it happen if
I run through there as fast as I can.
  Any solution would be helpful.
  Ive received the same error in one or two other places, but only in Neriak
Commons is it consistent.
  Happens on both my PCs.
