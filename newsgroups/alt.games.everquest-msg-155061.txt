LOL- Yeah I used Shadow Step one time in Paludal with my necro just to try
it out.  I pulled a Recondite to the waters edge near the first bandit camp
and as skellie was beating on it I hit SS.  Next thing you know I am all the
way across the cavern in the water near the second bandit camp.  By the time
I figured out where I was, and how to get back, my skellie was dead and
someone else had killed the Recondite.  I figured Paludal wasn't a good
place to SS.
