Ok. I've got a couple level 20 char's. and a couple more almost there,
but I don't know much in terms of the stats of all the equipment out
there. Therefore, it drives me nuts when someone /auctions "Selling
all on me...".

For cryin out loud, how much trouble would it be to put the stuff in
bags so I could see all the pertinent information?! I know, more
people can look at what you have at the same time if they all just
inspect you, but they invariably wind up asking you the stats on some
item or other.

Just show it to me, dangit!
