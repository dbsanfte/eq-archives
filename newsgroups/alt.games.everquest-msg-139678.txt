Heh . I side with the wizards on this one . Either of the porting classes
should be able to port to any low level zone they want to. If they cant ,
then porting at all just dosent make much sense.

On the other hand I remember a politically incorrect statement about
ethiopia. The united states has deserts also, we just dont try and grow
crops in them. Why exactly would a wizard WANT a port here? If I was going
to have one though it would be downtown queynos.
