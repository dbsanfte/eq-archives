I got SOL in the mail a couple of days ago. I installed it... all 3 disks
(now that's what i call an expansion...) I started it up... Downloaded all
the new patches... Clicked play...  waited.... waited.... waited.... Logged
into FV server... Created a Vhah Shir Beastlord... entered world...
waited.... waited.... SLOWWWWWWWW.... Sat... Camped... Quit... Options...
Turned everything down to low... went back to old textures... uncheched all
new models.... Logged back into FV server... waited... waited... entered
world... SLOOOOOWWWWWW!

I guess it's time for me to upgrade my mobo/processor...
Here is what I have in my system:
Athlon 600
GeForce2 MX 400 64MB
512MB pc133 sdram
soundblaster live
etc etc etc

I cant believe this shit...  Oh well, I guess I'll wait til they fix these
problems before I log back in..
:(
