They aren't all afraid to tank  :p
And if a group is having difficulty finding slowers I always volunteer to
be the slower as well.  I drop my gimpy slow on incoming and then wait for
my slightly less gimpy epic proc.  Seems to work well.

Last night I had the same AC and more HP as a beastlord than the same
level SK in the group.  But he wanted to be MT because "beastlords wear
leather and can't tank."  At my level I sure won't be tanking in PoP for a
while, but LDoN?  Hasn't been a problem.
