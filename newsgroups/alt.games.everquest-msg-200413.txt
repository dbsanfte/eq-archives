Definitely not. This all reads like a fairy tale to me. I guess you
actually work for 989studios not to have comms problems.

I have a lvl 37 bard, which is my main and first character. The main
time I use charm is to "taunt" a mob off one of the other support cast.
It works beautifully for this.

Bard charm is so unreliable that you take significant damage from
anything of useful experience. Yes, I have maxxed instrument skills all
around. As well, it cripples your song casting as the song only lasts 3
tics and the slighest comms problem and your thumped good and proper.
