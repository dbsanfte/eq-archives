See my other post, Fleshgrinder drops in what is known as "Pyramid" on
my server from the days of old Cazic (through the maze, sometimes
called "4 Corners" on other servers).  The area is a good bit harder
than most of the maze, two very clued up groups in the mid 50s could
probably manage IF they were on the ball.

Don't go unless you have a slower who can get his or her slows to
STICK on high level mobs, a level 55 Shaman is going to be in for a
world of hurt.

Toxi Axe drops in the maze but is much easier to get, Ranger only and
not that amazing so unlikely to tempt many people along solely on the
promise of that.
