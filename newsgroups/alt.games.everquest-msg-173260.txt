As a melee, I can tell you that when I see that a charmed mob is next on 
the plate, I target it, get in range, and turn on autoattack. Then the 
instant it breaks (now easily viewable via the pet life bar attached to 
groupmates life bars) I am on it and attacking.

So if the notification lag was the culprit, that may explain things a bit.
