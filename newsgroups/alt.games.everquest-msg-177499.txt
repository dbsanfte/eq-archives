I know.  You can train up on anything you can target.  I just meant that 
I don't use it when I'm in a group anymore, because I don't want to fear 
the mob when it's not snared and/or near guards/friends.  And since I 
don't feel like hitting the key all my life when I'm *not* levelling, I 
wait until I'm lockpicking and then pull out my hide/sneak/instill 
doubt/hide/sneak hotkey (they all have the same refresh rate).  U, 
hotkey, left, right trains me in the above, plus lockpick, plus sense 
heading, plus sense traps.  Even at the slow rate it goes up, I usually 
get anywhere from 2-5 points in it when I do that.
