The only problem (well, not really a problem) is that a sidekicked character is
not able to enter a minimum level required zone, even if they are sidekicked.
They are still level 7, they are just fighting as if they are level 17.  Per
above example.  Pretty much the same thing as if you leveled up without talking
to your trainer, you are level 7, now fighting as level 8, but you still level 7
as far as level restricted zones go.  But there are still so many areas to
fight, without going into a level restricted zone, so this is a non-issue.
