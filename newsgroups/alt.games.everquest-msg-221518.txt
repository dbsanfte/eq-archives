Some things I wasn't going to suggest until I saw the post about
the Nadox raid -

BoT Ice boss drops Mantle of the Rainmaker - +100hp, 18ac and
a bunch of stats - Pal, Shd, Bard, Rng, Bst.  Also drops 
Ornate BP's (plate), Bulwark of Faith (shield) and a 14/18 1hs
(think it's most melee)  He's the easiest boss in BoT - we took 
him today with 13 people.  

2 clerics
1 shaman
3 warriors
1 ranger
1 bard
1 enchanter
4 mages

The enchanter was the only one with a charm pet (2 of us mages
have CoTAM, but no elementals on the way to the boss).

Got to use CoTAM for the first time against Chaoswind - my pet
did 493DPS (89,215 damage) and I did almost 20k in nukes.  Then
enchanter pet did 433dps (77k IIRC)
