You have us wrong here, Alexa.  We are not anti-American at all.  We
are very critical of America, the United Kingdom with this particular
piece of military action.

I, personally, am critical of the US media in that the amount of real
news and debates it shows on it's networks.   I have held for years
that if your news were better and stronger then incidents like 11th
September would never have happened.

And this is someone who isn't anti-American and also is the views of
my very much American wife.

Also, I think that you are a bit confused about your history.  You are
falling into rhetoric when you say that you saved us from the Nazis.
The Axis forces would have been more accurate.   After the Battle of
Britain there was a massive standoff over the Channel.  Hitler had to
pull out anyway to fight the Eastern Front.

All that would have happened is that we would have had a more united
Europe with two main powers and after some amount of to-ing and
fro-ing we would have continued with Hitler as the Chancellor and
whomever as the Prime Minister.   And, the US would have had less of a
set of international trading partners.  Which is why, etc etc...
