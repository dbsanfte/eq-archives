The purpose of the con system is to tell you the level of the mob your 
are conning, and give you an idea as to how much xp you can get off of 
it.  It also, generally, gives you an idea of how tough the mob is, with 
exceptions certainly.  This makes life more interesting.

There are actually a variety of reasons for undercons.  Some of the are 
quest mobs which SoE does not want people casually killing, so they are 
major undercons.
