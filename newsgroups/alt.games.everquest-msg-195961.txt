OK, I pull with slow, MA for a bit before rogue joins in, stick a
couple DOTS and still the rogue gets aggro and keeps it.

Now the first thing that occurs to me is incompetance on the part
of the rogue.  She's only 16th and might not really get the whole
evade thing.

She seems to know what she's doing though, this is a low level
alt of a high level caster of some kind and seems to have the
basics of EQ down.

Another possibility is that evade skills just aren't high enough
to be effective at her level... particularly if she hasn't
deliberately capped them out.

Another is that she's got fast enough weapon(s?  do rogues get
dual weild by 16?) that she's just generating way more aggro than
I am.

I have a 9/22 weapon and SCHW for haste.   I don't imagine I'm
going to improve on that anytime soon unless someone has a
reccomendation.

Another is that I'm not using a sufficiently annoying series of
spells.  I thought slow and DOTs were pretty good aggro?

Thoughts?
