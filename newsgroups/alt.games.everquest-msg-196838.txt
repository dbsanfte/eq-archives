When I start a char (and I do this everytime) I stay in the newby area until
lvl 5. I then go to Blackburrow until lvl 10. From there I go to Kurn's
Tower and fight until 18 avoiding the basement. Last I head to Paludal
Caverns and try to get in a group in Camp 2 until 25.... I have done this
with 6 chars and had them to 25 in less than a week usually, all without
powerlvling. Try it and see what you think and let me know.

I am now trying to figure out where to go next without powerlvling..... I
have a couple of 60+ chars on Tunare and can do that but its no fun.
If anyone has any ideas on 25+ fast lvling spots let me know. I think I am
gonna try Paw and see.....

Peace
