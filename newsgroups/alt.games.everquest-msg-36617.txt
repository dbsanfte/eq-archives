If I'm on as my cleric, who is a 200 brewer, I'm usually in EC
buying/selling things.  If someone wants Headys I'lll usually ask someone to
just get me the supplies and pay any offer they wish.  This is usually
betwen 5 and 50pp per stack.  I also made 50 stacks for an aspiring tailor
who paid me 1k for my time.
