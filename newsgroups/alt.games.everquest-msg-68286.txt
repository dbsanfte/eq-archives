I ran into this "XML parsing error" problem too.  I figured there must
be an XML file in the Everquest directory it was trying to parse... I went
and looked for one and found three.  Taking a guess that it was trying to parse
default.xml, I took a chance and removed it, hoping that the patcher would
realize it's missing and download a fresh copy.  Well that actually worked!

Once that XML parsing problem was fixed, I was offered a choice of the
normal servers, rather than just the test server.

I hope this helps you.

Good luck.
