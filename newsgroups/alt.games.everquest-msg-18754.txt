Earlier today I went to Everfrost to buy a spell from
a shaman there.   Stopped in the newbie area and
was buffing/healing, and, of course, drawing agro.
The goblin pups(?) would agro off the heal, hit me
once, think about it, and go right back to the newbie.
All w/o me raising a hand (or a finger) at them.  Even
had a couple of adds that hit me first, then left for the
newbie after realizing they weren't doing any damage.

Yesterday in Splitpaw, we had a group with three warriors,
a monk (who pulled), a wizard and me.  It wasn't difficult
for the warriors to get them off of me after a heal or off the
wizard, but they wouldn't come off the monk for anything...
FD doesn't seem to be as effective anymore either, as far as
that goes.

The changes seem much more "realistic" to me, although I'm
sure the monk doesn't appreciate them.
