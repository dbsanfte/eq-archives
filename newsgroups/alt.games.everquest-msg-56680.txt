Uh. Warriors are great taunters, no doubt about it. But the above claim
that the Warrior was playing "wrong" if he ended up out-taunted by another
class is just plain ignorant.

I'm just a lowly enchanter, but I guarantee you I can taunt better than
any class other than a cleric. (Yes I know, you're comparing melee taunt
vs melee taunt...)

If you can cast spells you can out-taunt any warrior. Period. Don't
believe me? Talk to the rangers. If I -want- the mobs agro, I can have it
any time I want, and I don't care if the warrior has chewed through 4 bubs
of the mobs HP. I can have it in a single cast. Don't get me wrong, I
don't WANT the agro, but I can take it if I really want it. (Like, I'm
suicidal or something ;-)

Clerics of course, are The Best Taunters of All. Although I don't think
that's a title they really want ;-)
