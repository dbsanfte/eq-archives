No, you are not another party. You are another Sony-owned entity in that 
context.

Except that the whole exchange occurs in the context it was meant to occur 
in. This approach is an unrealistic straw man.

I wasn't agreeing with the copyright statement, I was agreeing with the 
contract legality statement. I should have been more clear.

For breach of contract, Sony would probably approach it by saying that EQ 
makes them 50mil a year and that damaging the economy damages the whole 
product.If they get damages of just .01% of their revenue, you are still 
out $2k, plus legal fees.

I don't recall having to click "I agree" to any copyright disclaimer.
