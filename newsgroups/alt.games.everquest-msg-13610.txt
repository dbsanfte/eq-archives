I'm guessing your account was banned and you're claiming it was stolen.

Although it's certainly POSSIBLE for someone to steal both your login name
AND your password, I think it's much more LIKELY that you either gave your
account information to a friend, guild member, or wrote your password down
in a text file called "passwords.txt."  Or, of course, you were stupid and
fell for one of those website scams.

But yeah, if you're not lying about having the account info stolen AND you
weren't a freaking moron for getting all bug-eyed because you didn't
practice safe computing you should certainly appeal the decision.

But if it was IN ANY WAY your fault, through gullibility, stupidity or
violating your EULA, don't bother.
