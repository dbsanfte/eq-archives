Things we need to know to help:

-What level are you, Chris?  
-What kind of character are you playing?  A Ranger?
-What expansions do you have for the game?  Did you buy every
expansion?  The "trilogy"?  Just the original game?

Oh BTW, the bank in Qeynos is in South Qeynos.  Remember that Qeynos
lies in 2 different zones.  You need to look in the one that is
farthest in to the city.

Better yet, try the newbie areas around Halas (if you dont mind
attacking bears and wolves).  You can farm silks and pelts, and
actually make a little money with the newbie quests there.  (When 1
plat is a lot of money...)  The PoK book is in the same zone as the
hunting grounds for levels 1-15.  And if you don't have PoP, the Halas
bank is easier and faster to find than the Qeynos bank.

Aside from the obvious cues we are probably used to, such as dress,
movement, etc...

-Right-click if they are out of inspect range.  You will get "This
player is too far away for you to inspect"
-Look at the name color.  NPCs have a particular shade of blue.  PC
names are in a different shade of blue, or in purple (anon/roleplay)
or red (pk).  (Assuming Chris isn't on a Zek server)
-LOL, attack them (Don't do this Chris)
