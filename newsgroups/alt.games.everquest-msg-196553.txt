You are being ridiculous.  It is only practical to tell people not to sit in
some raids since some people do not know that.  That said, I do not believe
it is true that you should not sit in a raid at kael, or at least to the
ones I have been on.  That may point me out as a noob but nevertheless I
have been several times to arena and never had a problem sitting.  If I am
wrong there then that also proves that it would have been a good idea if
someone sometime in some raid had told me it was a mistake.  If no one says
it then people do not learn it until the bad things happen.
