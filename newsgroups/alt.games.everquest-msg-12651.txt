    I'm thinking more in the off hours, when nobody's there anyways. On my
server Sol B is deserted except on Naggy raid days and Ragefire killings,
even at peak. Maybe one group in King, one half-group in Pool and an Efreeti
group maybe. And the soloing monk, of course.

    Don't you find the pull length to be silly long, or does your puller
bring a pile all at once?
