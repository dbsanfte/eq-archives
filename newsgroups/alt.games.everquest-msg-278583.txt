Simple question:  Would you be just as happy if the group had
said "oh - sorry, we'll just wait for a cleric then"?

Since you finished the mission, you DID do EXACTLY what a
cleric (or shaman, most likely) would be able to do.   So why
did you leave EQ2 again?

About the only difference between EQ2's group roles for
main classes (priest) is they didn't make the same mistake
they made in EQ with CHeal and Slow.   There's simply no
stupidly over-powered spell like those which unbalance the
game to the point a priest class can't handle any group.

Every priest can heal, it just takes *exactly* what you said
was needed in that DoN mission -- a group adjusting to
the type of healer they have.   A fury can NOT heal as
well as a warden - or a cleric subclass.   The group (and,
obviously, the priest themselves) simply need to make up
for it by adjusting their play style.  The *only* difference
is I don't need to tell a group "we will need to go slower"
because we don't -- the group doesn't have any limitations
because their healer is class X instead of class Y (assuming
they'll adjust their play style, of course.)
