Are you trying to combine them in the Curing Kit from Felwithe? If so,
that's your problem. You need the Enchanted Sewing Kit. The tailored newbie
armors will combine in any normal sewing kit or loom, but not in the kit
meant for a different race or class, if I remember correctly.

The Freeport Loom is in East Freeport. Its upstairs in Velith and Bardo's
Imported Goods.

The Freeport caster armor is sort of a rusty red, by the way.
