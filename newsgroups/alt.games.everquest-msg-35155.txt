They're not *all* that bad. A while ago, some guildies escorted Zavo
whatshername around the sarnak fort in Ill Omen and got paid 50 pp
each. And a couple nights ago, three named spiders were running around
Dreadlands. Two apparently went down quickly, while Poker McQuik, the
smallest, kept running off to hide. 5 minutes after I'd arrived in
zone and teamed up with two mages, Poker was running around the area
where I was. The mages and I couldn't cast on it, the higher mage pet
couldn't fight it, but the lower mage pet could and took him out with
the help of a nearby monk. Nobody was killed, and the spider dropped
an exe hood that the pet owner got. A GM showed up after he died and
we talked about the spiders for a bit (the others dropped a veil and a
weight reducing bag), then the GM left and we started our little exp
grind of the night.
I've been a victim of the overpowered zergling rush type random event
myself, but this small one with the three spiders was rather fun :)
