LOL, I have preferred eating a death in a lot of zones rather 
than training, or had my necro alt on hubbys account call my 
dearly departed self [until i got too high] or necro buddys to 
call my dead ass to the zone. Honestly, in PC it is so damn easy 
to make xp eating a death is inconsequential unless you have plat 
invested in buffs or pet toys... I just dont like training=\
