It seems I am going to have to learn the tricks to soloing yellow and
red mobs :(

Give them to me! That fast casting Nature's Touch clone was exactly
what I wanted. Does Verant want me to spend my time in raids
pretending to partially CH (if they ever do that) while the clerics
assist heal instead of me?

I have never ever contemplated switching my spec to evo - until now.

It's not the point. Nerfing your everyday blue hurts virtually
everyone... Soloers, casual players, most pickup groups. I heard even
Howling Stones was bad exp now. Instead of utilizing all the zones
with mobs supposed to give exp to level 60, the unwashed masses will
be flocking to CT and leaving all the other areas empty.
Didn't they learn from when the only good 50 zones were LGuk and SolB?

I only ever use the new interface while I have my bazaarmule running,
and she doesn't see all that much time. I guess she can get an extra
bag now, though.
