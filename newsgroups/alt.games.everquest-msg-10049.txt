Heh, Wandering the Karanas as a 16 Druid, I run across this Big
eyeball and it's pet. Low blue eye, green pet, hey, I can kite and AoE
those two just fine, right? I decide to charm a lion Patriarch and get
it to occupy the pet, then AoE the lot of them in kite mode. Well,
guess who has never even seen an Evil Eye before, buch less read up on
them...

The EE pet ignores my lion, and rushes me at speeds that equal SoW (??
haven't figured this one out yet) when the EE charms the lion. Lion
and EE pet begin their quest at taking a good look at my insides when
"You lose control of yourself". This is when I know for sure that lion
is EE charmed, and not that my charm broke, as they all stop whacking
me and we move along as a happy group...
A couple minutes later, the lion breaks charm and is understandably
ticked at me. My charm pops, sot the EE pet /assist lion... We are
near the Grobb zone so I put on my boogie shoes and head for it. I am
pretty sure that my head broke the plane of the zone line when I
dropped unconcious, soon to die of lion poisoning. 
I pop back into the other karanas that I was bound in (forget which),
mem up, buff and go for a corpse run. Guess who is camping my
corpse.... I got lucky, I charmed a green lioness, sent her to attack
from long range, and boogie for opposite zone line to draw the EE out.
It works, I zone and am able to come back for my corpse. Lesson
learned.
