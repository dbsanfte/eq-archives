Yeah, thats one of the symptoms - it seems to be zones where liquid borders
land like Plane of Fire or Natimbi. But there is just *oddness* too. In
plane of time I can run with full luclin models at a reasonable frame
rate (ok, I count 15fps as reasonable, I know twitch-junkies sneer at me
for that ;) ) , but in plane of fire if I have luclin models on at the
tables I get - literally - 0fps. Less than 1 frame a second. 

Its driving me nuts ;) The real kicker, though, is that 10 people in
luclin models at the tables will cripple me, but 60 in time wont.

Also, the black sky + pink moon, invisible ground, random crashes, and
inability to use EQW bug the hell out of me ;) Sometimes EQW is silky
smooth on both toons, other times one (and only one) becomes a total
slideshow while the other is fine; the slideshow one loses all textures
become just white object shapes and even detail on the UI like text
in chat boxes, etc, become blocks of colour rather than discernable
characters.
