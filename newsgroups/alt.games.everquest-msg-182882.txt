You don't have AEGO? why the heck didn't you buy aego you can't do anything
without it.

even ppl in teens already save up for kei and eago. those buffs are for lvl
60. And you can do very well without it. It requires some more learning but
in the end you can outperform one who has it just by skill. All the peeps in
their 30's depending totally on uberbuffs all get stuck somewhere in their
50's because they still have to learn all the skills their toons require.
Because at that lvl kei is not such a big benefit anymore. ppl dead simply
because they can't kite when 00m. warriors dieing because they got a few
dots and never mastered their bw skill. Or even a druid saying to party
member medding to heal you while poison eats away your health.2 ppl
bandaging you will keep you alive as well with most dots while healer meds
and mems counteract series. In the end it all comes down to skills and not
to uberbuffs because once depleated it makes no difference anymore.
