Anyone checked out Shadowbane yet? Looks like its going to be the next
big thing for roleplayers and PvP. It will have true guild warfare
with player accountability. Also will be able to construct cities and
multiple building and control of guard and vendor NPC's. Its main
aspect is centered around large scale PvP. Stop By their site at 
http://shadowbane.ubisoft.com/gameinfo/about.shtml

Afew keys points are:
The first MMO to offer a Dynamic World Model which allows players to
physically change the terrain, politics, and history of the game as it
evolves over time.

Role playing elements combined with strategic elements allow city
management, army creation, siege warfare, and economic development.

Tools such as grief log, kill on site list, bounty hunters, no
anonymity, and player locator greatly enhance player accountability

If you are considering a move to Shadowbane and are looking for a
guild stop by our guild website http://legionofsavant.netfirms.com
