I agree with the above statement.  For me, one thing I like about
MMORPGs is is running around, exploring, and seeing the sights.  This
goes double in areas where the creatures can kill you in one hit - I
often feel it was worth a long trip (and death) in order to see a
certain building, waterfall, etc, that I wouldn't ordinarily get to
see without a month's worth of XP under my character's belt.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
