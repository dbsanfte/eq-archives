I've run thru WL about 20 times now and never ever seen anything
besides Wuoshi that saw invis.  Followed the wall north and around,
followed it south and over to Wuoshi, went straight, nothing.

Even the  Corrupted Unicorn doesn't see invis, nor, oddly,
does his skellie pet.

Are the giants you mention faster than SOW?  If not, then a druid
with a modicum of self protection skills can certainly survive spotting
them, long as he stays out of arms reach.

Oh, I forgot, long as he's crossing WL he should drop by the tower
and grab all his purchasable spells there.  Won't be able to port to
PoG yet, of course, but he'll familiarize himself with the location,
and have the chance to reapply SOW and camo if it comes to that
