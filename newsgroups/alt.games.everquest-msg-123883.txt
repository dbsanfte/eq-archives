SK was a great place for my druid to hunt. When griffawns are blue, and 
have been for a few levels, one can snare them and charm them (WARNING: 
always have a fresh sow for this), then use them to kill scythe beetles.

Assuming your experience is somewhat like mine, one blue griffawn can kill 
3 yellow scythes with ease.

Then, either dispose of your pet or, if your last scythe eats your pet, 
dispose of your last scythe.

Worked for me, anyway.

Oasis is a good place to go, though... Snare and dot a croc, fear it, then 
sit and med. A rogue or monk partner is very nice here too, and Orc Alley 
is a great place to be if you have an OK group.
