Given what he said, it seemed quite clear that he knows that Butcherblock is
NOT on Kunark.  Specifically, if you will reread his post, he said that not
having Kunark is his excuse for quadding dwarves in Butcherblock.  When he
says that he did not have Kunark at the time, this could be taken as a hint
that he knows that Butcherblock is not on Kunark.
