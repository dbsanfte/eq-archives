Ok this hasn't come up before, I guess it happens when you start getting
into the more fought over areas.

I was fighting in a group in Highpass Keep when another player came down the
stairs and shouted for a camp check. It was obvious we had the room camped,
we were a full group and all of us were there.  We shouted back that the MR
was camped but the guy didn't leave.  About that time a goblin popped and
started running around the room.  He didn't aggro on anyone, so we were all
chasing him around.  The next thing you know, the other guy starts fighting
the goblin and we ran over to attack it.  Well he starts yelling "GET OFF MY
MOB!" "BACK OFF MY MOB!"  etc... None of us backed off cause we figured it
was our MOB.  After we kill it he starts getting really nasty and starts
yelling calling us all N00B's  (shudder) and yelling about how he's going to
report us and on and on.   He lets us know that because the Gob aggro'd on
him that it is now his kill and we kill stole him.

So whats up?  Did we kill steal?
