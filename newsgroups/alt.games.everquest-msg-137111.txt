My guild has two shamans that can be considered active. They are both
60, both have torpor, and both have a pretty well established routine
of canni + torpor. I've thrown heals on them a couple times, but it
doesn't seem to break their stride much whether or not I do that. Now,
instead, I could be healing up the mages and all the other people who
are doing the modrod routine. What good is it to have the shamans at
full health and mana when the rest of the raid isn't ready yet?

We have only one 60 cleric main character. That means that on some
raids, we buff with PotG in addition to circle. On those raids, you'll
see me hunting around for modrods (nasty new bug with that, btw) as
much as anyone else.  We have yet to be in a situation when shaman
mana alone has held up a raid, and a case like that would come under
the exception where I will spend my mana getting a shaman up to snuff.
I have also healed shamans who have decided to canni to below 2
bubbles in the middle of a fight.

I need my mana too (debuffs, *lots* of assist heals, nukes), and
whether I spent 400 mana to heal 1k or 250 to heal 900 hps once every
3 minutes, there's no way I'd match the efficiency of spending a
measly 200 mana to heal 1200 twice a minute, and then *I* would have
to either sit on my butt to get back that mana, or take a modrod that
would otherwise have been used by someone who genuinely needed it,
etc. etc. etc. 

I don't know of a single spell more suited to match with canni than
torpor, so I expect those who have that option to bloody well use it
and let me heal everyone else who needs a little patch instead (and
that includes shamans who don't have torpor, by the way).

Is it clear yet?
