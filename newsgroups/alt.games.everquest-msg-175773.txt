I have always said that when God abandons you then logic and reason can be a
light in the darkness and I believe that in the last 3.5 years it will be
the secular artists, scientists, educators, politicians, engineers, anyone
who values knowledge, learning, respect and kindness for others who will
make through to the end as learning can be a path through the darkness of
tyranny and injustice although not ultimately as effective as following God,
but still quite admirable and noble and many great things have been done by
those who dedicated their lives to knowledge. I would have to assume that
they will clearly see that God was right all along if they truly value the
light of reason and they will become the last remnants of the church and
will probably be the most vicious and dedicated of all as many of them may
be converted Satanists who tend to value logic and reason above all and if
they choose to really see what is going on then they will be saved as well.
Only those who choose to worship themselves and choose to be ultimately
unhappy by clinging to the cares of the world will not be saved at the end.
