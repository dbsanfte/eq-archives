Heh.  You make it sound so simple.  But I'm reading email on a SunOS 
machine I'm connecting to from an IRIX box.  So notepad isn't quite ready 
at hand, here.  And I really doubt his signature is worth that much effort 
on my part.  If he really wants it to be seen, he can trim it down to 79 
columns... and then cram it into 4 lines. :)
