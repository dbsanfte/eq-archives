I have read on several places here that we should wait till our damage
increases. I have noticed that damage for me is about twice the damage
rating of the weapon im useing plus str bonus. Does your damage actually
double? If so when, I have a 95 in one hand slash and a 80 in dual wield.
Does it come to pass after 100 on your weapon of choice? If anyone has any
info on this I would like to know. My current weapon of choice is a
Elderwolf Jawbone and Velium Scimitar(which doesnt proc. yet). Damage is 23
/ and 12
