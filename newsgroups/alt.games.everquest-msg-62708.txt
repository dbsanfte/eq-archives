Nothing is absolute, there's always A First.  Someone mentioned bad cases of
lost corpses...that would be typical of a new zone being attacked by
inexperienced players (FoH used to be 1337ist n00bz...now they're just
1337ist), yes.

Purposely doing a zone without doing the research?  Well, in my opinion that
definitely falls into the "brave but daft" category. <g>
