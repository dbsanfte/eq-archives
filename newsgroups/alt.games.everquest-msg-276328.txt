Not if MS thinks that by doing so they will destroy the reason
subscribers want to play the game in the first place.  In other words,
the long term view might be more profitable than the short term view
when in comes to MMORPGs.

Anyway, this message was just posted today on Vanguard's boards:

"I've stated it on the boards before and I will state it again.
Microsoft has no plans to sell currency or items in Vanguard. We are
on the same page with Sigil in this regard."

"Microtransactions are actually a very cool idea for games w/o
subscriptions. In these games developers often like to make ongoing
content but without a monthly fee there is no way to fund that
content. Microtransactions make it possible to provide new levels
quickly and efficiently. The content is paid for by the small
transactions and it allows them to release content more quickly than
waiting for enough for a complete expansion. Because there's very
little(or no) persistence in these games there is no impact to a
virtual economy. The developer and publisher gets paid and the end
user gets new content at a low price. Everybody wins."

"I know there is a lot of anxiety about Microsoft on the boards. I
will make it very clear that while we have a lot of different
technologies to choose from, we are only going to implement the
features that make sense for Vanguard. We aren't going to do anything
to compromise this game."

"So relax guys."

That seems to make perfect sense to me.  We'll just have to wait and
see how things pan out.
