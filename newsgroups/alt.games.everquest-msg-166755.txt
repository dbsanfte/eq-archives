I spent a couple hours in PoN with me at 57, Ranger at 59, and a Druid at
61.  Ranger pulled and tanked nonstop, I slowed, hasted, buffed, tossed the
occasional DoT, Druid healed.  We were able to handle that, including a
couple of times when 3 mobs came in, and numerous times when 2 came in.
Sure, we probably could have XPed faster with a "real" tank, but, I made 3+
blues in that time.
