You are absoultely right, when we quit worrying about everyone else, it 
would get bad. That is why we are involving ourselves with Iraq. But you 
cannot use the same tactics against North Korea as you would Iraq. They 
are both different as we have discussed in another part of this thread. 
Iraq, as you say, cant put up much of a fight. N. Korea on the other 
hand, has the "bomb" and has told the UN to piss off. Their attitude 
already is piss poor, and we are trying to prevent that "possibly 
final" ending.

Outside of that, I would imagine that most other countries understand 
perfectly the "public relations" nightmare that N. Korea holds. If we 
become too aggressive with N. Korea, I am sure the world community would 
really have something to say.
