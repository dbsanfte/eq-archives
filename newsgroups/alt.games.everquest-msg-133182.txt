I've gated more in the post 55 levels than I did my entire
carreer prior to that.. and probably more in 59 than
in my entire 55 to 58 carreer.

At these levels, many encounters turn into certain wipes
very visibly.  Camping out is often impossible as there
will be no chance of me sitting for the 12 seconds after
DA wears off without getting "sit aggro" and forced to
stand back up.  Quitting out... well thats very often no
more than a dream, it works perhaps one time in three.

In many raids, though, getting back to the combat area
from my bind point (right across the zone line) is a relatively
trivial affair.

So I DB, mem gate, click off DB and cast.  Occaisionally
(when there doesn't seem to be -any- useful spell to keep
in that last slot) I even keep gate memmed.

If you'd told me any level before 50 that there would come
a time when you'd see me standing around in the middle
of a fight with DA, DB, and Gate memmed, I'd have
though you'd been turned into a shroom once too often
in Fungusgrove!

Total wipe.  Anyone camp?  Darn.  Hey, here's Bergh.
Full health.  All his gear on.  But he's still in my group!
Wow, he's rezing everyone like he still has C3 and BAOR
on, too.  Whats up with that?

Gate?  Never heard of it.
