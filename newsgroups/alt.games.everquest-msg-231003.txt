Just picked up the level 20 Combat Skill Provoke and curious how exactly
that works.  Says it has a duration of 1 minute.  Does it make my normal
taunts stronger, or is it basically an extra taunt?  If it is just an extra
taunt and has a duration of 1 minute, does that mean the taunt stays
effective for the full minute rather than being the hate spike that Taunt
is?  Also is there a website that has information about these new abilities?
