Yeah, right.  That's why you had to ask me to explain my use of the
term "spouse".  That's why you though same-sex marriage would carry a
significant financial impact as opposed to the current situation.
That's why after I explained the change to you, you made no further
reference to it.  Dude, you don't have much credibility on this one.

Oh, I'm supposed to magically know what you mean?   To me "getting my
way" means just that, I get what I want.  As of the time when you
posted the comment about "getting my way",  the status was:

1) Ontario court orders same-sex marriage - not what I want, but a
good step
2) Ontario gov't won't appeal- not what I want, but a good step
3) Federal gov't will appeal- not what I want, and a potentially bad
step

So, given that I had posted what "my way" was before you comment, and
given that at no time have I had things "my way", how can you tell me
that I'm "getting my way"?   If you meant the ruling then say "you
agree with the ruling".  Don't blame me if you can't write an
unambiguous personal attack!

Good, then you'll be leaving now?  You won't be missed.

How fascinating.   I will weight your opinion vs. that of learned
individuals such as law professors, judges, and political commentators
who have written papers on the subject of the legislative vs. judicial
balance.   Don't expect your opinion to carry much weight.

<snipping the rest of the drivel>

Funny how, once the profanity and emotional language are stripped out,
very little remains of your posts!
