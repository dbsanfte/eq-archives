The doctor is the main healer class. The adventurer also has healing (very
good group heals). However, *all* classes can use healing packs, nano packs
and first aid kits (mostly out of combat but I've seen new (to me) packs
where you can heal and recharge during combat (you still have to sit)).

Guide to understanding a net.addict's day:
Slow day: didn't have much to do, so spent three hours on usenet.
Busy day: managed to work in three hours of usenet.
Bad day: barely squeezed in three hours of usenet.
