Seems like recently half of the higher end druid items in the game cast a no
mana DoT, Drones of Doom.

In order of hardness to get....

1)  Elder Spiritist sleeves.   From Karnor's Castle, off the Drolvarg
Sentries.  (I believe.)  Very rare, but the sentries aren't hard to kill.
Droppable, and can be bought for 3 - 5 k platinum, I believe.  (on E'ci.)

2) I forget the name of it, but we got a druid staff (with some moderately
good stats, wisdom and mana) that right clicked Drones of Doom from the Golems
in Fear.   It dropped off Terror, but probably all three of them can randomly
drop it.

3) Druid bracers from 2'nd floor Hate.   Once more, right click Drones of
Doom.
