If by your side you're referring specifically to right-wing Christian
extremist republicans, you're quite right. I have considerable venom
for that particular group.

Ack, no, I hadn't heard that one yet.

My favorite involves some school officials in Oklahoma accusing a
student of witchcraft. And to think these people actually are trusted
with students!...

>I'm not putting the words in your mouth, I'm only going by what you write.

To recap, Hughes noted:

"So few people realize that the first republican president was Abraham
Lincoln, or that the civil rights of blacks where passed by
republicans
over democratic resistance."

I responded:

"I can go down to the local car dealership and buy a brand new Ford,
but it won't be at all like the Ford my grandfather drove."

From that, you somehow arrived at:

"Are you suggesting that the current republican party is the party of
racists, then?"

The point being that the party Hughes was talking about is different
from what the party is today, not that they had undergone a complete
reversal. And pointing out what the party did in Lincoln's time is
akin to me putting my high school ACT scores on my resume when I'm in
my thirties - anyone who considers that a relevant indicator of what I
am today would be an idiot.
