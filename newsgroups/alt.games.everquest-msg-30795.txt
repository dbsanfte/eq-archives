These are good for a while.  Maybe MANA/HP ears later on once you've broken
200 elsewhere.

Good choice.

>Face: Velium Ruby Veil: +8 STR, +8 WIS, Wt. 0.1

OK here.

>Head: Savant's Cap: +2 AC, +3 WIS, +3 INT, Wt. 0.3

Runed Circlet 4AC 4WIS 4INT from Perma off of Goblin Preacher.

Or spend a little more and get the velium ones.

>Wrists: Ivory Bracelets (2): +3 AGI, +20 MANA, Wt. 0.2
>Possibly quest for: Chipped Bone Bracelets (2): +4 AC, +5 WIS, Wt. 2.0

By now you can probably quest for a pair of Bracers of the Reverent
9AC 5WIS SolRo Temple quest with stops in NK and RM

>Arms: Platinum Armband: +3 STR, +3 WIS, Wt. 0.3

Get rid of these quick!  I don't care what you put on your arms even if
it has no WIS as long as it has AC.

>Hands:
>Soloing: Gauntlets of the Ardent: +12 AC, +5 AGI, +5 vs. Cold, Wt. 3.8
>Grouping: Split Paw Hide Gloves: +4 AC, +3 DEX, +2 WIS, Wt. 2.0

Get out the checkbook and buy a pair of Gauntlets of the Black
AC15(!) 4STR 3WIS.

>Shoulders: Lizardscale Mantle: +5 AC, +3 WIS, +3 INT, Wt. 2.5

Adamantite Epolets AC9 7WIS and cheap

>Chest: Bloodstained Tunic: +13 AC, +4 AGI, +4 WIS, Wt. 6.5
>In bank: Dwarven Ringmail Tunic: +12 AC, +8 vs. Fire, Cold, Magic, Wt. 4.5

Chestplate of the Constant is achievable

>Back: Small Leather Cloak: +4 AC, Wt. 1.5
>Possibly quest for: Mammoth Hide Cloak: +7 AC, +4 WIS, +5 vs. Cold, Wt. 2.5

Yes, probably about the best you're going to get until planar-level.

>Waist: Straw Spun Belt: +10 AC, Wt. 6.0
>Possibly quest for: Belt of the Cenobite: +5 AC, +7 WIS, +10 vs. Cold, Wt.
>1.5

Rare as all hell, and pricy too if you want to buy.

>Legs: Mammoth Hide Leggings: +6 AC, +3 STA, +5 vs. Cold, Wt. 4.0
>Possibly quest for: Gatorscale Leggings: +7 AC, +4 WIS, +15 HP, Wt. 0.4

Good interrim choice.  AC here is another option.

>Feet: Acolyte's Anklet: +3 AC, +3 CHA, +2 WIS, +2 AGI, Wt. 1.2

Foot-slot is tough for clerics.  GEBs are the holy grail for those short
on wisdom, but a high-AC plate-class boot without WIS wouldn't be out of
place.

>Primary Melee: Sceptor of Flame: 1H blunt, Delay 29, Dmg 7, +15 MANA, +5 vs.
>Fire, Magic, Wt. 4.5

Paw of Oppola if you want to give up the idea of melee.  Gives you some AC
too.

Alternately I'd suggest either Velium Etched Stone Mace or Tainted Battleworn
Morningstar (from undead clerical mobs in Kith).

>Secondary Melee:
>Soloing: Charred Guardian Shield: +10 AC, +9 WIS, Wt. 8.0
>Grouping: Testament of Vanear: +10 WIS, +10 MANA, Wt. 2.0

CGS for both.  If something goes bad, the 1 WIS probably won't save you,
the effective 16 points of AC from the shield might.

>Ranged: Nothing
>Possibly have made: Small Wisdom Deity: +2 WIS, Wt. 0.1
>Possibly quest for: Medicine Totem: +5 AC, +5 WIS, Wt. 6.5

Alternately one of the pottery idols.  Stats dependent on diety, but not
as expensive or hard to get as the totem.

As a comparison this is what my human cleric is in at level 30:

Ears: Forest Loop x2 (1 to be replaced with Ivandyr's Hoop)
Face: Velium Ruby Veil
Head: Runed Circlet (to be replaced with Imbued Field Plate Helm)
Neck: Imbued Field Plate Collar (Erolissi Marr)
Arms: Imbued Field Plate Vambraces (Erolissi Marr)
Hands: Gauntlets of the Black
Chest: Chestplate of the Constant
	(to be replaced with Imbued Field Plate Breastplate)
Wrists: Bracer of the Reverent x2
Fingers: Velium Jasper Ring x2
Shoulders: Adamantite Epolets
Back: Mammoth Hide Cloak (to be replaced with Imbued Field Plate Cloak)
Waist: Imbued Field Plate Girdle (Erolissi Marr)
Legs: Greaves of the Penitent (to be replaced with Imbued Field Plate Greaves)
Feet: Boots of the Reliant (to be replaced with Imbued Field Plate Boots)
Primary: Paw of Oppola
Secondary: CGS
Ranged: Idol of Erolissi Marr

In this configuration I have WIS190 while retaining a high-600s self-buffed
AC (this toon is screwed up and dumped 10 less into WIS than he could have).
With an alternative configuration I can get to low-200s WIS sacrificing about
40-50AC, but I've never found mana pool to be a problem at 190 vs 200.
