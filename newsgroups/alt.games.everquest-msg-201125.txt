My fault as much as yours. I just feel very strongly about this.

The problem is that someone else *forced* me to make that choice and, 
yes, forced me to leave, because they devalued my time there so terribly. 
That's extortion in my book.

I can see that and am honestly open to the possibility. Though I am prone 
to being a grumpy sort, I normally try to think it through at least to 
some extent before posting a rant. I did that this time as well. Whereas 
my initial post may not have been as reflective of the situation as I 
would have liked (such as the part about the SoW'ing in PoK - more as an 
interesting side note than anything else, yet not prefaced as such), it 
is saying something that I saw behavior from others that has caused me to 
take measures which I have found unnecessary in years prior - creating a 
Jerk List.

Courtesy is rarely shown by over-assertiveness. These clowns were the 
perfect example. Running someone out of a spot with nothing but your own 
interests in mind is wrong. I can't be more clear about it than that.

I guess I should point it out for the record. I never said they broke any 
game rules. They merely showed an extreme lack of common courtesy and 
general selfishness. They don't have to break a stipulated rule to be in 
the wrong.

Do you honestly think that such a discussion would have left the option 
open of my joining them? Suffice it to say that if they were willing to 
just march up and start jumping at every mob that pops, indifferent to 
the person standing there, then I didn't see much chance for negotiation.

That's just not good enough though. I have as much right to be there as 
anyone else. Just because there are rude people there does not put me in 
the wrong for also being there.

It *is* very hard to ignore the zem, though as I understand it, that is 
to change soon?

Bah, you may be right there. It is just a crying shame that a person 
can't rely on being able to establish a reasonable hunting spot without 
it being subject to the whims of others.

The more I think about it and second guess myself, the more I just 
confirm to myself that the other group was being greedy. Why was I the 
one that had to leave? I'll repeat, there were not enough mobs there to 
make it worth their time in the first place.

Yeah, well, sometimes I get a bit defensive when bitching about some of 
the toddlers I run into in game. No offense intended.
