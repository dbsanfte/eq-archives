The only shaman in our guild currently working on his epic asked a few
of us "bigger folk" to come along and keep the shark dead for the test
of patience, so I'm guess not. Then again, he may have just been
paranoid. But you may as well bring friends to kill the shark anyway. At
least you'll have somebody to talk to.

Not needed apparently. They all have a different name when you right
click on them, and are easily recongnized. Very common drops too. The
various ones were dropping all the time. There is one that *only* drops
off the messenger, who usually spawns over near the stables, but he's an
easy kill too. Our shammy got them all in one play session there while a
bunch of us were camping the place for xp/loot.

Stop at the docks in Qeynos and check the merchant there by the water.
Newbies may have sold a bunch off. Failing that, grab a pole and some
bait from the merchant and you'll have some scales in no time.
