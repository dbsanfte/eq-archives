while i understand and side with you, i think the resolution of easy/insane
mode is simpler than you think .... i think they're already there =)

i don't own LDoN, but from what i hear, there is enough randomness that it
seems to be an expansion intentonally designed to surprise

i think easy/insane would just be too much of a "spoiler" in the sense that
it would take the surprise out of the moment, no?

and for true insane hardness, i hear the LDoN raids are quite difficult

(the most randomness you'll find in eq -prior to ldon- is in mobs that are
around 50 ... sometimes they spawn and can summon, and sometimes they spawn
lower...and loot tables can be random, but are more constantly just
dissapointing =P )


and my assumptions aside, why would you *ever* want to do something easy?
hehe
