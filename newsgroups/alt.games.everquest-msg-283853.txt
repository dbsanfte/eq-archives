" Seems the cleric here thinks most if not all classes are cleric support
 classes."

No, clerics support all classes. We save the lives of everyone. When a 
little help is needed in return, it simply should be given. Period.

I have seen clerics as you have described. I do not beg for mana throughout 
the game, only in rare instances such as I have explained... when the group 
dies and the mana was depleted due to Rez -Temp-CH... Not sure why some of 
you have such a distain for clerics. I hope to recognize your names in-game 
and refuse a rez to you. That'll show ya! roflmao
