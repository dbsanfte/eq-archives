Put me down for July 1, 2005.  

I'm not sure of the number of long-term subscriptions (3/6/12 months),
but assuming either 3 or 6 is the most common, they should have a good
idea about either their cancellation rate, or the returning numbers
(those that left and didn't like WoW/EQ2) by then.

EQ seems to require a certain minimum to feel 'alive' IMO, and I think
some consolidations may be in order rather quickly.
