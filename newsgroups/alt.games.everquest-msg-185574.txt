Aperantly any mez will overwrite another.  I still have the problem that
if you do use AE mez and get yourself, all the mobs will run over and
whack on you when you both get out of it.

If you are getting that many resists you need to do two things. Get your
cha up, and fight lower lv mobs.

I started charming with my enchanter as soon as she got the spell.  I
started my enchanter before kunark because I couldn't get my shaman past
35, no one wanted to group with me, and they were always taking
enchanters before me.  Not to mention I got addicted to Clarity.
