Because of all the times that we had to listen (see) Dr00ds shouting
"Porting everywhere, but don't even think about it until you pay me! Oh, and
I'll buff ya when we're done porting (SoW and Skin Like Steel only)"  or...
That Cleric that we grouped with that demanded every gem that dropped, never
cast any spells that required gems and then charged for the Rez, or... the
offenses go on and on.

Shaman, OTOH, I will always research for them without charge.  They're all
nice and generous.




Can we turn this into a "Bash the stereotype" thread?
