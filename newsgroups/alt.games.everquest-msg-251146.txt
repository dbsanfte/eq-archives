The only reason the local 7-11 cant sell prescription drugs is because if
they could then the "illegal drugs" would be available at the local walmart.
Oxcontin is damn fine painkiller, it is also a morphine derivative. It has
the primary effect of eliminating pain, it has a side effect of making you
euphoric and happy. It has very small long term abuse problems but there are
some just like there are for most drugs.

Drugs in the uninted states are controlled to exacting standards. Every dose
is tracked. Every pill has a patient it was sent to. Doctors have to fill
out special paperwork for any of a large number of drugs most of which are
pain killers. If they write to many prescriptions men with guns come and ask
them questions. Since random chance and a general stance of lets be tough on
drugs is prevelent most doctors have had such visits and many good doctors
get them frequently.

It is far easier as a doctor to just say to hell with it and prescribe
asprin for excrutianting pain. What the hell it aint my pain. Our soldiers
carry morhine patches in there emergency first aid kits. You will not find
them in your local maufacturing plant though. Both places have the chance
for mauling accidents. I know it is painfull to think about it but YOU are
part of the problem of why that kid with cancer dies in pain or that mexican
immigrant who got sawed in half dies screaming .

It is completely realistic. What is more important though is that right now
the criminals are being protected by the rest of society. The police are
seen as an evil not a good by the majority of the people now. Society is not
gonna protect rapists, murders, and thieves.

First and foremost show me the good you have done with these laws. Show me
the people you have saved , the lives that are better for it. You dont even
have pragmatism on your side because we KNOW what the effects of
decriminlazing drugs are. We have examples to look at.

I see the debris these laws leave day in and day out. Show me the joy you
have spread, I see far to much of the horror.
