There can be several reasons:
1. "Ghosts", lag causes you to see players running which actually stopped a
while ago but the info wasn't submitted to your client. Good example:
Velketor's Lab has this a lot with ghost spiders.

2. Fake wall, some spots have fake walls which are meant to be walked
through. I think another post has a few listed.

3. "bug", in some places you can walk through a wall / rock by positioning
and using /duck just right. Good example is the rock in the pond in Paineel
to get to The Hole and another I found a few weeks ago is a rock on the
plateau in Cobalt Scar. It usually works when you can move just a tad bit
further under a wall/rock with ducking. Standing up then moves your torso
inside the object and moving a bit around, ducking some more and even a bit
of jumping will make you move into the object after which it isn't
considered an object anymore for your client (the object disappears and only
comes back when you totally clear it's dimensions)
