    Quellious has been slow recently, with the exception of the Fallen
Eagles/Underguild post. That got good after a page or so. I tried to stir
things up a bit recently by getting some ex-members of one guild to post the
big reason why they left that guild (the GL and officers are selling the
guild bank on PA "to pay for the web site"), but they're too honourable to
take parting shots at a guild they still have a lot of friends in. It's too
bad, too - their friends are getting screwed over.
