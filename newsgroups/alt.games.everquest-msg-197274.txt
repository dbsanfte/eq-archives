Why DS the cougar?  Regen yes, he can beat on you longer that way.  Cripple him
if you can arrange that, so he hits less hard.  Buff your own AC and HP up the
wazoo, so you get hit less hard.  While you are at it, get Agility buffs so you
succede on more skill checks.

But DS is just going to kill him faster, making you waste time pulling another
cougar to the zone line.

Don't DOT him either, same reasoning.  Heck, charm him and give him a regen!

Keep mob Ensnared -and- rooted, and yourself SOWed and Regened.

Belt and suspenders.
