I'd *guess* perhaps because of the 35+/- changes with FD.  Honestly, I don't
think I'd ever grouped with a bard around those levels so all my experience
grouping with bards is with mobs on the 35+ scheme.

Ahh, but the clerics that *know* when to heal are priceless...

Bard songs have always been a bit buggy and unpredictable with monks.  The
way it's *supposed* to work is that the bard is wiped from the aggro on a
successful feign as long as the bard hasn't *directly* aggroed the mob.

The way it *actually* works...  well, "buggy and unpredictable" sums it up
quite well.

It's not the icons, as such.  Just that that's the only way I can tell a
bard song is hitting me.  :)  So if you click one off and the song pulses
again, you're not fixing anything.

Oh yeah.  That aoe mana song will get a bard dead real quick sometimes. 
And, like you saw, in some freakish ways/places.  :)
