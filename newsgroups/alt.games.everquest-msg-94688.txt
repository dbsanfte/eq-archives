OK, this is how I do the quad kite thing.  I ensnare 4 critters, I try and
get 4 of the same kind.  You run them around until they are all lined up on
top of each other.  Then you hit them with your 34th level Lightning strike
spell.  With this you are using 149 mana to do 182 points of damage to all 4
at the same time, not counting resists.  And with ensnare you have around 10
minutes to do this so running a little ahead and meding is posable if you
are running low on mana.
