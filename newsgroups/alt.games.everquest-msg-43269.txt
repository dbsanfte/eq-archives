    I must disagree here.  MalX (Malaise, Malaisement, Malosi, and Malosini)
are never, ever a waste of mana on non-100% MR mobs.  I know mages and first
submit that they do, indeed, suck at pulling compared to most-other classes;
however, MalX is beneficial in so many ways that most groups would rather
mages MalX than nuke:
- Other nuke classes do max damage on all dd's
- Other DoT classes get those drains to stick the first time (except
disease-types).
- Chanters, Bards and Necros don't get re-resists to their crowd-control
efforts (in fact, when there are uber high pulls, MalX the adds first and
the currently-fighting one last).
- Pet castings and Weapon procs aren't resisted.
- Slows and Snares stick
- Mana-drains put your Chanters back at FM with no resists there either.
etc...

  Again, no reflection on the mage-as-a-class pulling, but when/if I do, I
do it with Malosi.  Reason?  I'd better be doing it anyway.
