*Engage English grammar/spelling machine*

You really are try to get personal with your insults are you not? I get the
impression that you're about 54, balding and wear cardigans...feeling
dissatisfied and complaining all the time about 'young folk' who make to
much noise as they walk within a mile of your house. Lets hope it becomes
your tomb sometime soon.

As the above illustrates I can write in full English but it takes far more
time, hence I won't do it often

*You feel the English grammar/spelling machine leave you*
