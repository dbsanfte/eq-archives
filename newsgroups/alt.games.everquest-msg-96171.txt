This question is asked about every few days here.

No, don't buy one.

They contain very outdated information about selling repetitive
tradeskill items back to vendors and information that everyone knows
in game of particular "good" old world spots to camp. Problem is that
19th generation twinks still can't get it out of their system and camp
new stuff so old world areas are always camped like aviak spawns in
lake rathe.

56 k a day.. ahaah.

There really is no shortcut. Play the game, group in good areas,
eventually group in high dollar drop areas like velks, win drops, sell
drops.
