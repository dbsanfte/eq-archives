People here in this newsgroup should have some pop-up screen that reminds
them that very few people make it to the "end game".  I have a friend that
has been playing this game since the beginning and his warrior just made
44th level.  Only one of my friends has broke the 50th level and he's a 52nd
level enchanter.  To do this, he basically lived EQ to the exclusion of
everything and everyone else.  He even lost two jobs because of his
EverCrack addiction.  He spent his entire vacation time playing EQ non-stop
and called in sick when he was close to leveling.  However, most of my
friends (can) only play for maybe a couple hours every other day at most.
One only took his character up to 14th and has since moved onto Anarchy
Online.  Now all my friends are working adults and not pampered teenagers.
Possibly the game wasn't meant for us but only free-time teenagers.

This is too bad and sounds like poor game design.  While most players never
make it to 50th level, those that do should not be penalized for such an
achievement by being made unwanted in groups because they're then
ineffective against mobs.

That hasn't been my experience.  As a cleric, I never have a problem getting
a group and have seen shammies shout over and over for a group.

If your take on this is correct, then this would seem again to be poor game
design.  Few people make 50th level and beyond so making a class that is the
"best" at its supposed specialization only after 50th level is wrong.

When I hit 60th level?!  I'm not a teenager that has nothing else to do with
his life.  To be honest, I don't really even expect to make 60th level
before I move onto another MMORPG.  Forget 60th!  I don't expect to make
50th before moving on!  Heck, this very night I made 31st level (very very
slowly) but got killed twice when making a run (SoW on both times) past the
spiders to FV.  I dropped down a level and to what I was when I logged on
tonight!  I wasn't fighting anything!  I was just trying to make a stupid
run to FV to sell loot I got at FM fort before I logged for the night.  All
because EQ in its unfathomable wisdom doesn't provide even a merchant in FM
to sell to (to say nothing about a bank) ... nor enables merchants to
exchange lower coins for higher coins.  That second part (coin exchange)
would probably end people dumping on the ground or destroying copper,
silver, and even gold at FM fort as well as many other places in EQ.  EQ
doesn't have to have a banker in each zone.  Simply a merchant that will not
only buy your loot but also allow you to exchange your coins.  But knowing
EQ, they'll put the merchant at the bottom of each zone's dungeon (as they
had done with a banker in the old Runnyeye) thus making it basically
worthless except for those who really don't need to worry about what's in
the dungeon once they can safely get to the merchant.

Ugh.  If all this is true, then again it is poor game design.  Also I feel
lied to by Verant since they pitched the clerics as the best healers in the
game from the word "go".  Read it in their player's manual.  Now I'm truly
am depressed over this issue where as I was only a "tiny bit" when I did the
original post.  :-(
