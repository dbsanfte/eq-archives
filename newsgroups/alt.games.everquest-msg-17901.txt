Not to get too technical, but in any competitive market, things sell
for their marginal cost.  Sunk costs have no bearing on pricing.  That
is to say, in EQ terms, the cost of training a skill to a given level
has no bearing on the price an item should sell for.  The item will
sell for the marginal cost of making the item (i.e.; the "very tiny
slice of the process", or 550 plat).  In mathmatical terms P=MC, or
price  equals marginal cost.  This is all with the caveat that the
relevant market is a truly competitive.  In the real word, and in EQ,
there is no such thing as as theroetically perfect competitive market,
which is how businesses can make profits.  (No business can make a
profit, aside from the relevant profit expectation of the market as a
whole, which is not worth considering now, in a competitive market).  

To sum up, it is not, in fact, wholly unreasonably to expect past
expenses to have no bearing on current prices, but in fact it is a
sign of a competitive market.  To quote Buckaroo Bonzai, "No matter
where you go, there you are."  

Sorry for the econ lesson.  Didn't mean to  lecture.
