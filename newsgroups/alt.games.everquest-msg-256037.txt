I think a decent comparison here would be time invested. Would a casual 
player who has played for 3 years and put in x number of hours be equal 
to someone who has played for 1 year and raids frequently and who has 
put in the same number of hours.

Everyone invests time, the only difference is how peoples' lives allow 
us to invest that time.  No one is going to get to Time playing 1 or 2 
evenings a week, even after 3 years. Yet to a raider from an uber guild 
a casual player might not be seen as committed since they do not make 
themselves available for backflagging, and meet the minimum raid 
requirements.
