This is my first post to this group so I'll try not to offend anyone.

I have read previous posts on the debate of Clerics being a boring class to
play, med, heal, med heal etc.. But this is not the reason for my question.

I was introduced to Everquest back in October of last year, so still
consider myself to be a relatively new player and EQ is my only experience
of Online gaming.

My first character which looking back wasn't created with the best possible
stats/race etc has now managed to reach level 24 using the following route.

1-5 Freeport West (Rats, Bats etc)
5-11 East Commons (Bears, Orcs)
11-15 North Ro (Dervs)
15-18 Oasis (Orcs)
18-21 High Pass Hold (Orcs)
21-Current Level High Keep (Guard Room)

My problem is this, I'M BORED, not with the Med,Heal sometimes Stun line of
work, but from the Mobs I'm currently camping. Grouping is something that I
enjoy, but day after day, battering the same Orc/Goblin Camp until they
start to con green too much is driving me mad.

I have never left Antonica and I want to know if anyone can give me some
alternative zones to try. I'm not to concerned whether they yield good loot
or good xp, I just want to be able to try a new zone should the need arise.

Apologies if this question could have been asked in a shorter post, but I
look forward to hearing any ideas you may have.
