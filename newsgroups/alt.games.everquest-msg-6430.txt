Ewww i hate this!  I'm ok with Super's thing.  But people who send me 
a tell for a sow or a port. ICK!  Oh if they are standing right in 
front of me and choose tell instead of say to be "heard", I'm ok with 
that.  If they are not standing in front of me I prefer a shout or OOC 
to the zone that I can respond to if I'm inclined, which I usually am.
