If that's true, it would be very easy to confirm, wouldn't it?  If
your skill is, say, 100, try making something that's trivial at 101
to 105.  If indeed the modifier raises your skill, you should get
the trivial message when combining.

I'd also expect the number in the Skills list to go up, as happens
with other stat modifiers.  But that doesn't happen with the Geerlock
items.

I guess they could code around such behavior, but it seems a long
way to go.
