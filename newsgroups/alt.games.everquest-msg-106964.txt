This has nothing to do with your problem. When your computer locks up
the server starts trying desperately to get the data to you - you're
not linkdead after all, the line is still clear. There's just nothing
on your end to receive it.

I get very rare lockups as well, and can watch the modem blink madly
when it happens as well. It only happens because you locked up, its
not the reason you did lock up.

CONGRESSMAN:  "These reports undoubtedly prove that your product makes
    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
