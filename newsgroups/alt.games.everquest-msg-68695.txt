Just how far up VI's ass is your head?
There are BUGS in the client code they shipped!
The bugs are *ADMITTED* by VI.

Is this getting through to you?

It's not a compatibility issue, It's a fucking stupid sloppy bug
introduced when they shipped a product that NO WHERE NEAR ready for
production release.

Question:  How many nights since SoL was released have there NOT been
an emergency server patch?

Answer:  One.

They didn't drop the servers just one night since SoL shipped.

Does that sound like "compatibility issues"?
