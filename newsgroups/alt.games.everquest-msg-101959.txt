no excuse, other than to maybe wind up the grammar nerds ;)

If I'm in a particulary grammar conscious mood (when I'm not busy ;)  )  if
someone asks me "Can I have a clarity/crack plz/please/pls", I will reply
"yes you can" then watch them to see how long they wait aimlessy expecting
one... might even cast a spell on myself, hehe, which will occasionally
even garner a thanks even though I just cast, say, a cha buff on myself.....
ooh it's evil, but I like it.

Cheers

Kev
