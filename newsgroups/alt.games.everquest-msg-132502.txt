And, of course, you have studies and papers that back this theory of
yours up, eh??

So, let me postulate a situation for you.

Your kindergartner comes home with a note from the teacher.  It's a

Judging from what I have read of your posts, you would have no problem
allowing your child to attend that class.

Is that an accurate assessment??
