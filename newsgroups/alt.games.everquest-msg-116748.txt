In my guild (and a lot of others that I have dealings with) loot awarded is
"the guilds loot"

If you are awarded a cobolt BP from a guild slaying of trak, but then months
later you are awarded a Vindi breast plate, you would be expected to hand
the cobolt breastplate down to the next needing warrior.

That doesn't include twinks though (I think we have some kind of special
rate if we want to buy items for our twinks), if nobody can use the item
then its sold by the banker to raise peridot/coffin funds.   We can spend
40k-100k in 1 week of raids.  Its getting easier on cleric dots used now, as
we have 2 (soon to be 3-5 or so) mass group buffers (4 dots to aego the
entire raid).. but the wizards can still burn through a few stacks of dots
using giant/dragon bane.

If you join the guild and already had your own Cobolt breastplate though,
when your awarded the Vindi BP, the cobolt BP is yours to do what you wish
with it.

1 exception to this is quest gems.. if you obtain quest gems (either on a
guild raid or exp group or whatever) you are not allowed to sell them.. well
forbidden perhaps isn't the right word.. but it is certainly frowed upon..
and you are not allowed to ever take gems from the guild bank again.
