Well, one thing I know is that a 55 can readily land slow on golems in
PoV.  I was doing it with my 55 BL on friday morning while we were waiting
on the forces necessary for a shot at our PU raid targets.

And there's no way a 60 warrior can't tank stuff that a 65 ranger was
tanking with just a 30% slow on them.  The druid only ever threw small
heals at my BL when I slowed a touch early and didn't have protective
up.  She never needed to heal the ranger, she was able to nuke and dot
with her mana most of the time.

This was with 65 mage, 65 druid, 65 ranger, 65 cleric, 55 BL.
