	Using the same bow you use, with ice acrylia arrows, Endless Quiver,
Archery Master 2 and only my own buffs, my best crit to date is 550.  That was
without Trueshot, meaning in theory an 1100 point crit should be possible with
it.  I've only used Trueshot with AM 2 once, on a recent Talendor killing with
Focus of Souls and VoG, and I dealt an awe-inspiring 42.5 DPS.  I was so far
away that I didn't get hit/miss messages, so I may have had some arrows poof,
but I'm pretty sure that wasn't the case.  (I seem to have the right number of
hits given the period of time involved, a whole 44 seconds, and given the
usual abysmal hit rate on archery.)

	Sean Spiritarrow of FoH recently posted some tests to the Glade:

	(It wraps, cope.)  To summarize, he was able to crank off 212 DPS with a
40/38 bow and stats you wouldn't believe.  This sounds impressive, until you
look down the page and see that he melees for 188 DPS, and he doesn't have
Ferocity yet.

	There is an AA called Headshot at level 61 (Headshot?  Was BULLSEYE too
freaking obvious?) that gives you a chance to drop a level 47 or lower mob
with one arrow.  Of course, level 47 mobs aren't worth experience at level 62.
