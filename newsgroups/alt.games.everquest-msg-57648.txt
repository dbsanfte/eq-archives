Actually, one very nice thing about this, especially for someone new
to the game, is that it's a fairly risk-free way to explore a new zone
that you've never been in before.  I played around with it one night
and among the places I've found myself were Blackburrow, Unrest,
Crushbone, Cazic-Thule, Upper Guk, Lavastorm, Najena and a number of
other different places.  You can roam around the zone and get a little
familiar with it, and even if you do get killed, it's no big deal; you
just start over again as another mob, and don't have to worry about a
corpse run.  That's generally what I did, just roamed around; I
usually didn't start fighting something unless they attacked me first!

Anyway, that's just my two cents' worth.
