True but after you get to 8 or so you can head into the warrens. The warrens
rocks for exp and loot. One of my favorite lowbie dungeons. If you can muster
up a group you can kill and kill and kill.

No way you head to Black Burrow instead of NK. BB is an awesome lowbie
dungeon! Great place to learn pathing and about trains. You may die a lot
buts its never dull there. =)

True. Very laggy but its better with the new engine and there
are some good newbie quests here. Lots of mobs to hunt for
a lot of levels. I like this zone. If nothing else its never crowded.
Not as good as FoB but its a nice change of pace.
