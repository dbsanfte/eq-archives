The last Cray supercomputer I worked on - the Cray Y-MP - was released
in 1988.  It was composed of multiple 333 MFLOPS processors.

Typical high-end PCs today have many thousands of MFLOPS - at least
3000 and perhaps as high as 5000.

I'm not sure what kind of misleading crap you're trying to pull by
saying "high end PCs run faster than 1970s Crays".  *Of course* they
run faster than 1970s Crays.  Sheesh.

What the hell?  I said a Cray wouldn't emulate a PC/EQ faster than a
high-end PC would play it.  I never said, "A Cray isn't fast enough to
play EverQuest on" since that's far too ambiguous.  So I'm not sure
who you're disagreeing with.

Give up your fantasy: a Cray supercomputer would NOT emulate PC plus
EQ faster than a high-end PC would play it.
