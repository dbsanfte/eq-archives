   I'm sure it had nothing to do with my constantly whining in a.g.e. channels
and /tells that I wanted you to make me a Gnomish Vanishing Device so get busy.

    Anyways, I think you were on when I said I got one for only 1000 plat.  The
only other one I've seen on sell was for 10k, and I was pretty sure that I would
end up paying around that much.  So I know from personal experience that bugging
gnomes to make me stuff _does_ work.  But in this particular case, I am sure
there is no connection.
