Hail StanMann,

Sorry ;) - they've been keepin' me busy at work, no time for alt.games.everquest
(a.g.e) unfortunately - that was a.g.e. for those who may have missed it.
Imagine my suprise when now that I have some time to come back and read/post I
find a few pups pretending to be tough, wagging their little weenies around
after watching Top Gun too many times.  "Ban Lokari, Ban Lokari" ...morons.  I
guess their mommies told them to go out and play or something.  Whatever.
Anyway, good to be back, hope you've all been well.

StarkRaving - Long live a.g.e. 


..of course I'm mad...
Spiders?  What spiders?
