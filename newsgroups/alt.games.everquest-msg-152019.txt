   Man, Rumble, you sound like me before I moved to FV.  When I was on
Drinal, I simply did not have a main.  My favorite was whatever I
happened to be playing at the time.  I must have gone through 30+
characters.  
  I still managed to make friends.  My alts would play with thier alts. 
I made myself easy to find, by always naming my characters Tea + a four
letter word that described my class in some way.  It would be somewhat
harder for your friends to find your alts, but I'm sure you can work
something out.
   But yeah, without picking a main, it is going to be harder to keep
hunting with the friends to you do make.
