Ses, I have been playing on a 2 year old HP pavillion 
ze4100...1.8 celeron, 512mb ram, shared with the video card...

I get lag in POK and bazaar, and I only bother running the new 
versions of the character models for races I play that have 
horses [i like the old models, so sue me=)], and horses but I 
think it will let me pick 20 models to use, and I have always run 
with my spells muted but I didnt lag out in dragon raids/ring 
wars from spellflash.
