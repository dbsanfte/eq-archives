Aye, he's a quick little bugger, no doubt. But with two people it's
somewhat easier. When we arrived in Rathe Mtns. loaded down with gold,
and holding our rings and shadowed rapiers (no rent, by the way, mutter
mutter) he was *not* up, and instead the monk quest guy was walking
about. We killed giants for a little while to pass the time, but the
monk was still up, so we decided to just go park ourselves standing in a
safer area of the zone, and go take a break for a while. Upon returning,
realized that I needed to make a bank run and headed out. Sure enough,
there was Hasten. I alerted my partner who came jogging up to join me.
The trick we used was to just chain hail him while the other person
loaded up the window and hit "give".  Worked like a champ, and we both
got our boots no problem. And yes, just like the other poster's
suggestion, had *exactly* the correct change in the gold slot so that
went quicker. Oh, and he didn't despawn or warp away after the first
transaction, either. Just stuck around and did two in a row.
