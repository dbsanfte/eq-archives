As I recall, the decent pistols had the same accuracy as the rifles. 
Therefore, you may as well have used a pistol from any range, especially 
with it's much faster rate of fire.

It did if you never saw that speed cap. Are you talking about the top end 
weapons? I never had a rifle with a delay of less than 6 IIRC (that may 
have been with a powerup added). I think the fastest rifle I ever saw was 
around 4 maybe. I don't even know if faster ones were available when I 
quit playing.

Any ETA on that, or is it just lip service at this point?
