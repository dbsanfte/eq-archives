Okay, I've finally started getting the hang of kiting in EK with my lev 20
bard...  And, for the first time, I can finally solo something like
Griffawns and Crag Spiders without getting my arse handed to me...  (yeah,
by now, most Griffawns are Green to Blue, but I still think they are vastly
underconned)...  Anyway, my question is, what is the highest (non-caster,
please) that I should be reasonably able to kill via kiting (i.e. twisting
Selos with Bellow - I use Bellow, rather than Dennon's Discord, so I don't
agro something unintentionally... :) )
