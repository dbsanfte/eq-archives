Most of the people twinked to that degree have one or more bots supporting
them out of group, so the twinking is sort of irrelevant. Twinking that
really effects gameplay dramatically is regen, haste and high ratio
weapons. And these effects still command healthy prices in the bazaar.
Of course haste and high ratio weapons are invisible level capped
anyway.

Sure, that would be nice. But a lot of these servers are 3+ years old
so it's inevitable that a lot of the population has reached the higher
levels. A new player, other than in stromm, must exist in that 
environment.

I think part of the reason as well is that the funghi tunic is still
plenty rare and expensive, so it's not a substantial enough problem.
Unlike droppable weapons and armor that have obsoleted earlier items
the funghi tunic is a one of a kind aberration.

No trade sounds a lot like no-drop except it allows me to twink my alts.
I think i'd rather have no-drop and SoE paying a bit more attention to
their itemization on droppables. Their addition of recommended and
required level limits has already done a lot to protect the lower level
game from their dodgy itemization.

Although things like fixing the bug that allowed a level 1 caster to have
KEI is probably even more important.

I'd love it if they went back and renewed some of the old zones. A place
like splitpaw is still plenty dangerous, but the items are laughably
dated. If they're going to grow the games power level over time then
these places need regular upgrading to match the new power curve. Making
the items no-drop so they can't be farmed.
