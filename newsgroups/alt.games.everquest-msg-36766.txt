	There are no characters of appropriate level range for these zones,
because such characters do not go there.

	I've pharmed Runnyeye like a wheat field in Kansas, and I just spent two
levels in the Warrens with a low-level Necro.  There is hardly ever anyone in
either zone that gains EP for being there.  Simply put, there is no reason for
them to go.  Those zones are too difficult for most characters that gain EP
for mobs of those levels.  (My Necro made it because he's pretty heavily
twinked -- http://interealms.com/profiles/profile.cfm?ID=11724 -- and Necros
are gross anyway.)

	Improving the loot -- with or without the aegis of the TCC -- is not the
answer.  Runnyeye has loot on the 4th floor that level 50+ characters want and
30+ characters can get.  Droga has Idol of the Thorned, an item worth 20K pp
on E'ci and I'm sure more on younger servers, dropping off a level 35 mob.
Item drops in the Warrens are pretty much pathetic (most of the "interesting,
powerful items" Verant is protecting with the TCC are garbage not even worth
putting on a twink) but the coin drops and vendor trash are quite high for the
level.  Yet the zones are empty.

	Improving the zone experience multipliers isn't the answer either.  Kerra
Island has a whopping 20% ZEM.  My Necro has the place to himself.

	People do not go to dungeons (until they have to for EP) because they are
buggy train-ridden deathtraps.  They don't care how big a carrot you wave
under their nose, there are easier places to hunt.  The only thing the TCC
does is cut down on the number of people using the zones affected by it, and
that's the last thing the game needs at this point.

	What Verant needs to do is to stop trying to tell people how to play the
game.  They need to make the parts of the game people don't like resemble the
parts of the game people do like, instead of trying to bully the players into
doing things Verant's way.

	But that's just not the kind of behavior you get from 15-year-old
power-mad DMs.
