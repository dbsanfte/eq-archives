Being a low level wizard (14), I'm just curious what makes the wizards a
PITA.  Is it a behavioral matter, or are they just naturally able to
dominate a lot of ground with their long range spells.

I, myself, am generally concious of this.  If another player is running to a
potential target I was about to root'n'nuke, I generally let them have it.
However, it is really annoying to root a monster, then watch some other
clown step in and take the kill.  Sometimes I'm generous and let them take
it, especially if it looks like a newbie dwarf.  It is, after all, their
area.  OTOH:  three lightning bolts take out a wandering greenblood, and
it's a fast spell.  Sometimes you have to stand up for your rights.

Cheers,
Eric
