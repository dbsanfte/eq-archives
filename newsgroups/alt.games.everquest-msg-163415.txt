Hi All,

Having spent the last five days doing this part of the Druid epic, I
have not only become very frustrated, but also very good at pulling
the Deepwater Goblins (and some Tainted Aqua Goblins) from the top of
the tower here. I am now also Dubious as opposed to Apprehensive (of
course this is in Wolf-Form). Have killed no less then 40 Tainted, and
have yet to have a Corrupted spawn. Not the same luck I have had in
LOIO doing the Barracuda (all of 5 minutes before tainted then
corrupted spawned). If anyone knows a secret to this, like they only
spawn during a blue moon, or after you cast something let me know,
close to pulling my hair out.

I am not sure you even need to harmony this mob as I have pulled from
the top with all three there and only the targeted one comes (could be
because I am 56?). Don't waste your time using ensnare/snare just nuke
the one you have targeted and let it come to you since not only do
they heal themselves but the others also heal the one you pulled. Run
(East) down the tunnel (you dont need to bring it to land, unless it
is the Tainted). Then root it when it is a safe distance from the
tower, or on top of you (mostlikely). Usually takes about two nukes
(Breathe of Karana for me at 56), unless it heals or gets healed.
These can be a pain in the arse, because they fire arrows at you but
if it is rooted, just keep recasting the nuke. They also cast a few
whimpy spells on you too, but they are overcome with regrowth (or
regen) activated and lots of resistances on like Circle of Winter,
Summer, etc. Having C3 is a BIG bonus here, as less time to med after
pulling them. Dont worrry about adds because none of the ones (Aqua
Gobblins)in the tunnel seem to aggro at all.

I hope by sharing this someone can benefit, and hopefully have an
easier time at them than I currently am having!
