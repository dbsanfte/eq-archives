Fear can be a nasty place, and things can go very, very wrong there in a
hurry.   Fear is "raided", which means your raid will generally be the only
people in the zone.  When you first get there, your immediate task will be to
"break" the zone.   There is no safe place in Fear, until you clear it by
killing off the wanderers.   If they wander too fast, or you kill to slowly,
or someone gets teleported out of camp by the scarelings... that initial break
can end up with you fighting 11 or 12 level 50 monsters at once.   (thats
assuming everything goes well, and nobody screws up like running in the wrong
direction.)

If your initial break team fails, then you could be in a lot of trouble
depending on how strong of a raid it is, since your best 12 people can wind up
sitting naked at the portal, rather than inside fighting.  If you don't have
another two semi high level groups that are clothed, you might be SoL.

9 hours sounds particularly bad though.  The worst I've ever seen myself was
about 5 hours, a public raid that our guild went in to rescue.   I'm suprised
they didn't put out the word that they needed help somewhere around the 2 or 3
hour mark ;)  Unless they're one of those guilds with a bad enough reputation
that they did and nobody showed up.

For experience camps, that varies from person to person.  We have a (recently
made) level 60 cleric in our guild who rarely plays more than a few hours a
night, unless he is raiding.

If you intend on raiding at all though, large blocks of time are essential.
Most Hate raids that I've been on began somewhere around 7 pm Eastern, and
ended after midnight.   (And thats assuming they quit after the first floor
and don't even think about the second.)  The longest raid I have ever been on
was a 13 hour monster in Plane of Growth.   We did clear the entire zone
though, less Tunare, some big tree that they said was too hard, and one mob
camp.

The shortest raid I have ever been on.... (although I suppose this would vary
with what you consider a raid vs a one mob encounter / epic fight) probably a
Chardok run recently.   We bagged all 3 royals in somewhere around 2 to 3
hours.  Although I didn't time it, so it might have been more and seemed like
less.
