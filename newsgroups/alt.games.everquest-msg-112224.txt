I agree with you here. There's one time and one time only that 
I want my class/level showing, and that's when I'm LFG.

The /lfg flag currently is useless on FV. But once /roleplay can be
turned off, it becomes useful again.

Now, since they're going to do that to help the LFG problem, why in 
blazes do they feel the need to restore /shout to a zone-wide d00d 
chat channel as it is on regular servers, too? Argh! 

But we are welcome to filter /shout, they say. I don't *want* to
filter /shout. It has an important purpose: to warn others of 
impending danger in the immediate vicinity. If someone is driving
a train my way, I certainly want to hear their /shout.

One more thing about anon: I would really rather not see pure /anon
(hiding the guild tag, that is) on FV. They should allow /roleplay
or not /roleplay -- but keep the guild tag always. /anon just allows
miscreants to cause trouble without their guild tag showing.

This certainly has its drawbacks, and I can appreciate all of the
arguments against it. However, I'll admit that I am going to use
my new character slots. I am a packrat and my bank space is 
overflowing with quest items (hello Twilight Sea quests).

Plus, although I love my main on FV (51 shaman), I also love 
exploring the low levels with new race/class combinations. I'm
not even close to trying them all yet. :) It will be nice to
not have to switch servers to do this.


All in all, though, it's about money, and in Verant's eyes FV 
isn't pulling its weight in that department. So they're willing
to toss out big chunks of its unique ruleset in an attempt to 
make it more appealing to the masses -- which will in turn make
it LESS appealing to us who like FV as it is.  /sigh
