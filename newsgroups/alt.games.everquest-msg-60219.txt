Well... I guess i asked for opinions....
I must admit that _yes_ I did endanger
lowbies who might have zoned in after my shout
warnings, thats the one thing that only came to my mind
later on... And the reason I won't do this again.

I do think though, that you are being kinda
unfriendly here, for a reply on a simple request
for opinions...
Well - Maybe you should remember this is
a _game_.
I do realize that it's despisable to ruin others
fun in the game on purpose, which I don't,
I just had some fun, and nobody got hurt.
Is that such a big deal?
Since I know you will answer me "yes, it is",
you don't need to reply, just wanted to let
you know that I am a bit dissapointed in
your being so firm and apparently taking
the game that serious.

All the newbies I ever got killed by accident
(2 or 3 so far, and NOT on trains, but just during
regular fighting) usually were very happy afterwards,
when I gave them something as an excuse...
