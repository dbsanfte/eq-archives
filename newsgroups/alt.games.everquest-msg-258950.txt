Thanks guys ... reading over your responses it looks like the problem
is mostlikely to be caused by my modem/ISP.  I have not looked at this
piece of the puzzle since it all worked fine before I purchased LDONs.

In few months my rage will fade, and I will likely try this again. 
Untill then all of my friends and characters have to be placed on
hold.
