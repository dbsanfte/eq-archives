I've finally gotten in the habit of hitting F9 before
I loot a kill while on a horse -- I moved the "camera"
so that the first F9 view gives me a direct "overhead"
view of me on the horse with the kill lying in front of
me, and from there it's easy to right-click on the
kill (AND NOT THE BLOODY HORSE) in order to loot.

Then of course I have to hit F9 four more times to
get back to the first person view before I do anything
else.  Sigh.

I wish they could make the "horse head" insubstantial
somehow, so that you could click through/past it without
any difficulty.
