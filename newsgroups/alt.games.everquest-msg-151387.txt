Apparently, I've got the Safe Fall skill now.  Whoopee.  Mind you, it MIGHT
conceivably come in useful one day if, say, I happen to throw myself off a
tall building or over a cliff onto ...  No, I'm being unfair.  I'm sure
it'll be very useful.

But HOW do I practise it?  The Prima guide (which is Kunark out-of-date)
says that running down a steep slope will do it (for that 'thud thud thud
thud' effect), because it's not the DISTANCE you fall, but how often you do
it.  Don't seem to work, far as I can see.  I've been tumbling down dunes in
North Ro all day and I've not gone up a single tiny smidgen yet.

Oh, and parry's bloody useless, an' all.
