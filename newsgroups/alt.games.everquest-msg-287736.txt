I've never really used Tribute.   Played with it a little when it first 
came out, and concluded it was costly and inconvenient and not worth 
bothering with.

Things have changed a bit since then, though, for one thing its easier 
to manage (or maybe I just didn't understand it back then), but for 
another, I'm now in a situation where I'm using a high level retired 
character to farm alchemy supplies in an old school zone, where there 
are lots of drops that would be outclassed by Crude Defiant armor, 
namely Siren's Grottoe.

Netted Kelp armor gets between 1000 and 1500 a piece in tribute, and I'm 
hoping that in my 30s, I can really afford to run something useful for a 
while with that kind of points available.   Can't sell it in the bazaar, 
or even give it away, and vendors pay a pittance for it, so this seems 
like a good deal.

Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak: 1020
Ichor Encrusted Chain Gloves: 215
Ornate Defiant Chain Tunic: 46
Netted Kelp Tunic: 1508
Flawed Defiant Glass Shard: 55
Zaharn's Coronet: 84

Along with some previous dumps of CR drop junk, I have 3053 available, 
never used any.

Lets see, the level 10 ones all seem useless, boosts to regular stats, 
AC, HP, End, in very small quantities.

The level 20 ones add resists, Mana Regen, UV, Summoning Haste, 
Enhancement haste, EB, Extended Enhancement, Spell Haste, MP, IHeal, 
ERange, DoT damage, DD damage, HP Regen, See Invis, Haste, DoT haste, 
Summon Eff, DoT Eff

Lots of worthwhile choices in there

Level 30 picks add all instrument types, so useless to anyone but bards.

Level 40 gets Second Chance, which is a chance of insta rez on death.

At 45, Vengeful Aura adds in Attack

Then at 50, there's what looks like overcap to each stat, and Faerune

At 55 added song efficiency, increased Flurry

Finally at 60, there's still more stat bonuses, plus Accuracy.

I'll have to look at my current focus and MP/HP regen state, lets see:

ID II
MP II
BA III
BEff: II
SH: II
HP regen: 8
Mana Regen: 5

As a shaman, I buff a good deal.   Extended Enhancement would be nice 
for that.  I also DOT a lot, but already have both damage and mana cost 
reduction for DoTs.  While I do summon a pet, its a once a day type 
expense, not worth paying to save mana on that, and summoning faster 
would just be silly, for that matter buffing faster and even dotting 
faster aren't really worth spending on... Dotting faster maybe, but I 
have basic spell haste, so it would only be a relatively small improvement.

What do look good, then,are ER, IH, EE, HP regen and Mana regen, not 
necessarily in that order.

On consideration, I don't seem to be having range problems, I'll blow 
off ER.

IH, now, I don't see how I can go wrong with bigger heals, my heals SUCK 
as a shaman in the low-mid levels, and as I recall with get a lot worse 
before they get better.

EE, I wish I could turn that on and off seperately from the rest, but 
longer buff duration seems like a winner.

HP regen, mana regen, those will be expensive in any real amount.

Starting with Mana:
1 per costs 5/10 minutes
2 per costs 12/10 minutes, and thats all I can get till level 40

HP regen
2 per costs 5/10 minutes
4 per costs 12/10 minutes

Improved Healing is a loser, at level 20 I can buy IH I, which only 
affects spells up to level 20.  I'm using GHeal, which is a level 29 
spell for shaman, but that won't benefit from IH I, I need II, which 
isn't available till level 40!

Likewise, Persistant Boon can't be bought at tier 2 till level 40.  This 
is really stupid, IMO, not being able to get useful tributes until they 
are nearly outdated?

I toy with leaving Persistant Boon on, for SOW, but I was already 
dubious about the whole EE thing, having it almost useless just kills 
the thrill for me.  I'll run HP and Mana regen both at tier II, 12 
points each, or 24/ten minutes total. That means my current 3K will last 
  20 hours straight, if I never turn the thing off.

My son's monk will benefit a bit from the AC and the HP regen, and the 
10% haste (sadly, he has no haste item at all)but again there's really 
no "killer app" in the list for him, I doubt we'll really notice the 
difference.

Ah well, another dream of a reason to hunt in the old zones dashed.
