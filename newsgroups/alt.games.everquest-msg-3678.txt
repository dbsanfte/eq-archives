*shrug*

Never seen anyone on EMarr willing to pay more than 200 for it (and I
see /wtb auctions a lot). I got one from a guildie for 100pp and 3
honeycombs.

Just because you can't think of anything better to do than spend all
your gaming time doing that quest and selling off steins doesn't mean
everyone should conform to your greed.
