Doesn't mean you should act without regard to them. War is hell.
That's your justification for promoting the senseless slaughter of
innocents? Especially given the fact that it would, more than likely,
only encourage retaliation and more slaughter? You're either a

Besides, the theory now is that it was a terrorist action. Often
times, terrorists act independantly, not under orders of their
country's government.

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I 
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Leave me the hell alone.
