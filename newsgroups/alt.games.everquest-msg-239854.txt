...then you aren't looking at the bulk of items that melee characters
will acquire as they mature.  Strength is incredibly easy to build up
and stamina is not.  Join a LDON and guess which stat augment is the
most sought-after.  It isn't +str.  On top of this, only a few
characters can cast spells that increase your stamina for you.  Twice
as many can buff your strength.

Now I have had this conversation with others and many will disagree,
but I will say it again.  At least for rangers, and possibly for
monks, dexterity isn't easy to come by either.  My Ranger has built up
an ubuffed stamina of 215 or so.  Dexterity is around 160.  I haven't
chosen stamina over dexterity, per-se, either.  So I would either max
your stam and put the rest in dex or put equal amounts in both.

The *last* place you want to put your stats, well other than
intelligence or wisdom, is Strength.  Hell put them in agility before
strength.
