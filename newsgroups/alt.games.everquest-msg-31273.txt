Well, for example, my SBLive is fine with EQ in my current machine. It
gave all sorts of nasty sound hiccups on my old motherboard. There are
several different cards that have all been released with the SBLive
badge too, so really YMMV.

As to the Turtle Beach card, I don't know. The only Turtle Beach card
listed on the supported soundcard lists at the station is this one:

Cards we have tested:
Turtle Beach
Montego / Vortex A3D

If its that one, it works, but support is limited since it uses a
chipset by a now-defunct manufacturer (Aureal). If it isn't that one,
well, its not officially supported by Sony/Verant, it will probably work
OK, but they won't help much if it doesn't.

Check the list yourself at:
