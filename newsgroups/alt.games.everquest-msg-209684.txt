    Try and bind a friend's melee in the middle of the forest, away from all
zone lines and towns. I think you'll be surprised by the result. GFay is
flagged funny in that part of it counts as a town, and part of it does not.
I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the newbie zones in cities that
have them are likewise flagged oddly. If you wanted a real experiment, kill
an orc in the middle of the woods. Then, pull another orc into the middle of
Kelethin, under the platforms, and kill it there. Compare XP. Or, kill one
of those "a rodent" mobs in town, then run to the in-city newbie zone and
kill a level 1 mob there. Compare XP.

> If its not a zone based nerf, but rather a systematic nerfing of quest exp

    It has to be zone based. Rogues have a quest they can do where they can
do the combine that gives them significant visible XP anywhere. Guild rogues
have demonstrated that doing the combine in an old-world city zone gives
significantly less XP than doing the combine anywhere else.
