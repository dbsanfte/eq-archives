}I pray that restructuring never happens.  It's just one more thing for

}for meeting our own basic needs, once the government starts doing that, then
}we will start becoming less capable of doing so ourselves.

The government is supposed to represent us, so in a way, it's our own nose 
that it's sticking into our business.  The 'borders' of government also 
seem a bit fuzzy to me...  Is education a form of government?  Only public 
or state-supported ed?  I think implementation of Maslow's ideas would 
involve the most change to the educational system.

}Just look at the inner-city welfare socities; welfare has been more 
}effective in keeping the poor down, than raising them up.

Could you cite some studies to substantiate that?  I would be very 
interested in seeing them.  I think it's gotten more of the poor off the 
streets and into trailer parks and ghettos, personally.  It's a higher 
standard of living but also means it's easier for us to ignore the 
problems.

}Making "society" (government) responsible for meeting the needs of the 
}people will only result in a broader degeneration of the people, in a 
}similar manner.

I think it depends somewhat on how you do it... I don't think Maslow would 
recommend just -giving- people whatever they need, since, as you're 
rightly pointing out, that tends to create a huge self esteem and self 
actualization need that they can't fill.  I think ultimately, it would 
involve teaching people to meet their needs.  The old 'give a man a fish' 
bit.

It would be interesting if we could make welfare work like that.  I've 
heard of some pilot programs that address that, actually.  Making welfare 
and unemployment payments contingent upon taking certain classes that 
might teach skills to help get you off the dole.  It doesn't work very 
well for single mothers, though, being poor and a single mom can be a 
pretty massive disaster.  It would be nice to see a solution that 
addresses that as well.

}Or, is there an answer outside the government that doesn't create those
}pitfalls?  If there is, I'd be interested to hear it.

Depends on whether you think education is inside or outside. :)  There is 
a way in which education is just a sneaky form of government, a way of 
society imposing its ideas on you, but I think it's the best we have.
