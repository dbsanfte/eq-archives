in my experience, i do MUCH more dmg with lammy/lsoee than wurmy/lsoee
(granted, i haven't actually parsed it, but the same mobs were dying
faster!).  i ditched my wurmy in early 30s, and decided to give it another
try in my mid 40s because i wanted to see bigger numbers on my hits.  boy
did i regret that decision!  not to mention the fatigue benefits of a weapon
that weighs 0.6 vs 15 (something huge anyway).
