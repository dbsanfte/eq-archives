>Lake of ill omen is fine at 25>>>

I soled my 20 Druid to 34 at Ill Omen. I started out at the beach near the
stream leading to the FV zone, and then moved to the WIndmill soloing anything
that conned blue.

A NEC is a powerful solo character, more so than a Druid. You have a pet. Use
him well. :-) and  have fun.
