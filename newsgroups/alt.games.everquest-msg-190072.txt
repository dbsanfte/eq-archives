That sounds like a good start.

OK, so I can use the Gold CDs to install all the software and then if
I buy a new PoP CD I can use that key to enable all installed,
Original through PoP, expansions at once? Would I need to use a
different Sony Station account as well? And I guess I'd have to order
another LoY, right?

If I copy the existing EQ folder to the new system I should be able to
log in on one or the other as I wish, but not simultaneously, right?
Is there any way, once I've copied over and start using the new
machine to just enable the old, already installed, machine to be able
to play as well, without having to install anything else (since it's
all already there)?
