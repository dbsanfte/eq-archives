Try this:  Using an editor, copy the first half of the problematic
log to a new file, and the second half to another new file.

Parse each one and see which one crashes.

Then break *that* one in half, and see which half of it
crashes.

Repeat until you've narrowed it down far enough that
you can pinpoint which line it's choking on.  It shouldn't
take long.

Then you can either send a bug report to Pasketti (if it's
a legitimate line that the parser should have accepted), or
remove the mangled line from your original log file and
then parse what's left.

One thing to look for is unusual emotes from people.  For
example, a lot of log parsers identify which character
a given log belongs to by looking for "<playername> saved"
messages.  However, if another player had done a
"/em saved" around you, it would confuse the log parser.
