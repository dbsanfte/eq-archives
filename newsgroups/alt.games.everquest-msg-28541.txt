Cel heal is my most used spell but I always keep cheal memmed and use
it on the tanks as often as I can. You just have to use it at the
right time, when the mob is near death you don't have to worry about
aggro. I will never use it on a fresh pull, almost guaranteed aggro
that way. But on a high hit point tank its too mana efficient to
completely ignore.  Of course its all situational, on multiple mobs I
don';t want a ten second cast going off if I think one of my caster
might need a quick heal.
