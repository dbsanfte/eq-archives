Nice, innit? I've been keeping my +wis items due to tradeskilling and
am currently at 212 :)
A friend thought meditate seemed to be working better last night.

And the group heal spam for anyone with 'just a scratch'.

LOL! I forgot to ditch the key last night, but then again, I only
spent limited time on my main. There weren't many people in Sebilis or
Velk's, but there were too many druids/healers in both zones. They
should all go to the moon so I can get groups faster :)

Um, how would you shop with an untargetable npc merchant?

Heh indeed :) (GM turns switch off when the time comes to exchange
items? GM has to open trade window?)

True... but I was wondering if they might add it to some older items.

Someone on my server found beer goggles (face slot) that gave 20% to
alcohol tolerance :)

Bah, 60 game days between rezzes is nothing... or so Verant seems to
think. The ability had to be limited, but when you first need your 5
general skills, full training in Healing Gift, and 5 more points to
get the skill, you damn well should be able to do it a LITTLE more
often than once for every 3 RL days you play... 
It's become a 'bauble' ability.
