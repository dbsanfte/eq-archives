The rule gets a little shaky at the fringes.  A 20 can definately group
with a 30 and get exp, but not necessarily with a 31.  I've seen it
go both ways.  I suspect that rather than look at your level and
compare, the system is looking at your exp and comparing that.
This would mean that a 20 who is 4/5ths the way thru could group
with a 31 who was only just in, but not with a 31 who was almost
done... or something like that.

40 can definately group with anyone higher level than him regardless
of how much higher.  A high 39, if I'm correct, might be able to
group with most 60s, who tend to turn regular exp off completely
once they are a death or two into the level, in favor of AA exp.
