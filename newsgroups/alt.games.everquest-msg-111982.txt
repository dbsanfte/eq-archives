There's always been a KoS Molkor/Ulthork/Bulthar that wanders through there
every 8? minutes I think and the non-kos Enthralled types will assist. (note
that the Molkor/Ulthork/Bulthar bear a strong resemblance to the
something/Walrus/Sea elephant enthralled types)

Even if you do get agro after succor, just turn right and run out that
tunnel into WW, you should be able to survive, just don't go AFK during
succor load.

(BTW, you meant Molkor, Moktor are a variant of the Gantru in Umbral Plains
;)
