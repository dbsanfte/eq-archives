Sorry it shows KM on the map and I misposted the distances. It is in
Kilometers.

Take 62 miles, put it anywhere in the USA, small portion of exposure. I know
this is reasonable. But also add into the fact that many metroploitan areas
are at risk. And there are many issues we must gauge. Every person SHOULD
have data, and information to MAKE THEIR OWN decisions. That is what I have
provided to the best of my ability. If you choose to pretend things are as
they were a month ago, that's fine. Many people don't agree with you. And
those of us with children cannot risk the fantasy blinders many people wear
daily. We have to take every hiccup seriously and consider the children or
we are simply being negligent.
