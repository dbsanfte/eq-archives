Iam now level 35 with about 150 wisdom (druid halfling). All throughout my
EQ life, I have found a spot, gotten to know it, and soloed. Now that I've
hit 35 , I cannot find a spot I can handle. I am currently hunting (more
likely being hunted) in Frontier Mts. I just died there becuase of the adds.
Goblin something or other cast all sorts of spells on me rendering me
helpless. Was already low on mana. And the exit to LOIO is very hard to
find. I am upset. Now, I know my fun is probably not over, but did anyone
else having been in this position feel this way at this level? And what
should I do? Grouping is sometimes an option I guess, but would like to set
up somewhere and do my thing.
Thank you,
        Linda
