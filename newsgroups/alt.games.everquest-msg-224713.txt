They seriously nerfed sellback prices of most items.  I don't think there 
is much that is worth firing to sell back anymore.  A lot of stuff 
merchants will not buy back at all unfired, but, you throw away more 
money by firing it in order to sell it back now.  At the high end, they 
did this to star ruby encrusted steins, pre nerf, 30ish pp sell back, 
post nerf under 1pp sell back.  Lord knows, we wouldn't want anyone 
taking a loss of a mere 40ish pp per stein, much fairer to make it a 
70ish pp loss.
