This is just a shot in the dark (I don't have SoL yet), but is
there any chance it reduces the casting time of spells?

Actually, though, it sounds like "Intellectual Advancement"
should increase the rate at which skills increase.  Didn't
one of the patch messages say something like that?

(That would figure, since I just got Jewelry to 250!  :-) )

What does the icon look like?  What are the messages when
you cast it on yourself or someone else, and what is the
message when it wears off?
