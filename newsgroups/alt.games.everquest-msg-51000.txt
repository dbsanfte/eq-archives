term is one quarter, so 2 quarters would be half a year.

you would have to determine if people where adventuring more and producing
more plat in a given year versus the previous one.  with falling prices and
the supply staying the same and production staying the same, you would be in
a recession, because the GNP for EQ would be lower each year from lowering
prices.

I have no way to actually determine what numbers for the GNP of EQ would be,
or if production of items is staying the same, rising, or falling.  My
guess - estimate is that EQ is in a recession.  No one would argue that
prices are continuing to lower.

People who don't mind waiting could sell all their equipment, go play DAoC,
and come back in 4 months and rebuy all their equipment, making a hefty
profit. (presuming equipment isn't no drop)

Another issue is that in EQ you have automatic full employment, so in this
cyber economy if you want to work ( go kill things and get plat / items )
you can.  On the other side not everyone chooses to play / add to the
economy.

because its not possible to make someone not employable in EQ in terms of
stopping them from getting items / plat, its hard to call it a recession
because as a byproduct of recession that everyone dreads is the layoffs /
people out of work.  that will never be the case in EQ.
