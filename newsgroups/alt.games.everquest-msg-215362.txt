Starting a new thread with this, seems worth seperating out from
the depths of the "first LDoN experience" thread.

Interesting.

SO we have

70 76
65 51
60 34
55 23
50 15
45 10
40 7
35 5
30 3
25 2
20 1

That does seem to fit the few data points I have seen; in
particular Sean Kennedy said he had one group that got 51 points
three times running, and then a slightly lower level group
dropped down to 34 points.  I was in a 4 man group who's levels
averaged around 35, and we got 3 points; if having fewer than 6
members drops the "average level" for the purposes of the
calculation, then we'd come in at 30 and the point value would
work.

If this is accurate, then finding out exactly how the "average"
is calculated is a good deal more important that I'd thought,
since the calculation is clumpy.  If your group is near a
threshold, then one level either way on your 6th man could mean
the difference between a harder dungeon and an easier one, and
also a third again as many points.  Is the consensus that the
dungeons are 1/3rd again as hard?

I think the simplest assumption is that there is no "averaging"
being done at all, that in fact the total levels in the group are
used to figure which tier you fit.

Maximum level count would be 6 65s, for 390 levels, and you'd
presumably get the 65 dungeon for that. Sean had 5 65s and a 58,
thats 383 levels, and he got the 65 dungeon.  Then he stripped
out one of the 65s for another 58, and got the 60 dungeon, for
376 levels.  6 60's would presumably get the 60 dungeon, thats
360 levels.  And since the first group Sean had had less than the
6x65 level total but still got the 65 dungeon, I'd guess the
cutoff for the 60 dungeon is below that.

One test of my theory, though, would be to see how many points 4
65s get; if its really average level they'd get 51 points same as
the 6 man group; if its gross levels, though, they have only 260,
thats well under the 65 threshold, in fact its probably down in
the 55 threshold, so they'd only get 23 points each for success.

What I'd like to see is reports of how many people in a group,
what precise levels, and how many points for success you got.
See if we can pin down the thresholds for which dungeon you get,
and also resolve the mystery of what difference 4 man and 5 man
groups work with.
