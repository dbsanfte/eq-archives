   They are?  Cause my stupid cats go out in the rain ALL the time, and don't
even seem to notice.  Then they come back inside, and crawl in bed with us, and
want to get all snuggly.  Then when they do finally dry out, it's back outside
to restock up on that wet cat smell!  And they don't EVEN SEEM TO NOTICE WHY
THIS IRRITATES US STUPID CA.... ahem.  Sorry. 

> cats.  I like cheese

   Best grilled cheese sandwich.  Take out white bread, the good kind, and
lightly butter two slices.  Place in frying pan butter side down over low heat. 
Cover one piece with grated sharp cheddar cheese.  Cover other piece with grated
swiss cheese.  When the cheese is melted and the bread brown, unite the pieces
and then cut on the diagonal.

   This is such a good way to eat cheese.
