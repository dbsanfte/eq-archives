Haven't been posting much on this lately because I've been so damned busy 
trying to re-learn everything I learned during three months of testing. The 
Firesign Theater put out an album years ago called "Everything you know is 
Wrong", and that's how I currently feel about the crafting system in EQ2.

I'm not inclined to detail the changes here but let's just say that I 
couldn't even if I wanted to, there have been so many in the last 2 days. 
Servers are down at the moment because they are patching in a big stability 
fix whose patch notes say nothing about any of the many fixes needed to get 
crafting working again. So I have no idea if there will be joy in the 
tradeskill zones tonight or not. On top of all this, the principal designer 
of the system can't compose a proper communication to save his life and his 
"explanations" of the new systems he's unleashed on testers raise more 
questions than answers until someone finally takes a wild stab at what he's 
said and posts a randomly accurate summarization, at which point he offers 
up various "what he said" responses. /boggle

And we're what, 4 days from ship? Hopefully, the infrastructure they've 
built is flexible enough to sustain all these last minute changes, but 
they're pushing the limits.

If you're sensing that I'm frustrated tonight, yeah. In fact, I haven't seen 
this much frustration in the trade chat channels since I started. I remain 
hopeful that they can pull this off, but if the launch next week is as bad 
as SWG's, I will be greatly disappointed but I won't be surprised.
