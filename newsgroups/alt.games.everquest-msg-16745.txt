Hello there. I'm a bit of a newbie (but in my first two weeks or so,
I've got a level 11 (almost 12) half-elf Ranger) and I have a few
questions that jump around a bit. I'm really hoping someone would be
willing to help me out:

1. I'm currently using a 1HB weapon, but am equally trained in 1HS. Is
there an advantage to either? Both of my weapons are just bronze. Is
there a place relatively close to Qeynos/Everfrost where I can acquire
a better weapon? I have a budget of about 100pp or would like to do a
quest for one.

2. Last night, I teamed with a guy and I acquired a few mammoth tusks
and a hide. I remember reading about a quest for hides, but is there
something I can do with the tusks? Sell them?

3. Is there a list somewhere of how I'm looked at by different
factions? Do I just /con them and see what it says? I know there's
"dubious", but I don't know what the ranking is of how I'm looked at
by different NPC's...

4. I wanted to complete the quest for Ice Goblin necklaces. But every
time I talk to Lysbith McNaff, she tells me to do the Gnoll Fang quest
for her first. I turned in 4 sets of three (all I had), but she still
won't let me do the necklace quest. Is there a certain way I can raise
my faction rating with her? What group does she belong to?

5. In reference to #4, is there anything I should avoid killing (polar
bears, mammoths) in Everfrost that would lower my faction rating with
her?

6. Can a half-elf Ranger (or other class) do quests in pretty much any
zone? Specifically Everfrost/Halas?

7. Is there a way for me to know what my faction rating has to be with
a NPC to know if I can do their quest?

8. Can a ranger do a quest that's best suited for another class? I
realize the weapon/armor/item I may get may not be useable by me, but
I could sell it couldn't I?

9. I have a couple of polar bear skins. I don't really want to turn
them into Cindl, because I don't need that armor (too big  ). Is there
a way to know where/when Karg Icebear appears?

10. (FINAL QUESTION, I SWEAR! ) Any general recommendations on where I
should hunt/quest? I'm kinda getting bored with BB as it's always
camped and crowded. Plus I've been hanging out there since lvl 5-6. I
kinda like Everfrost for the exp, but thought I'd ask...

Thanks so much for any help. My wife is about to throw me out over
this #%$* game!  You can email me at: ocsfan@NO-SPAMyahoo.com.

By the way, I just want to take a moment and say how cool almost every
EQ player is that I've run across. I have had guys helping me out,
giving advice, pointers, money, and more than a couple save my butt
from mobs. I try to do the same when I see a total newbie getting
pummelled.

Paerien
