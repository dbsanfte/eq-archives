I may have started with a monk (and actually two of the casters came
before the warrior) but oddly enough, in 25, 26, and 31 levels
respectively on three different casters who all have to look at it, I
never once considered quitting the game over it. I'll admit I never
played a cleric past level ten, though. Maybe it's particularly bad for
them comared to other casters. I wouldn't know. Do I like the spell
book? Hell no. Did it motivate me towards making it to 35 and getting
rid of the damn thing? Hell yes!

Of course, now the point is moot, once this patch is finished.
