Ok class lets move on from A is for Apple

A group of 5 go and kill a mob and get 1000 exp points. How much does each
get?

That's right the value is 200

A 6th member joins and kill a mob and get 1000 exp points. How much does
each get?

That's right 200 each for all 6 as the exp is not divided by the 6th member
