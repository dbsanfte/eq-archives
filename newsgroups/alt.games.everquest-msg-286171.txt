Sorry but I think some of the guides (maybe all) are old.  I have a
tradeskill guides that I got for free and featured a skillup path to
250 and was from before LoY because nothing about LoY ribbon was
covered.  At a glance, it does look some of the guides are old.  One
example was to use arctic wyverns to max skill cap but that was nerfed
before the tradeskill cap was raised to 300. (soon 350 this fall!!)

Free and *UP* to *DATE* tradeskill guides can be found at
www.eqtraders.com under message board, in the UI and Guide section.

Platinum guide I found (3 different versions) mentioned a number of
tradeskill based recipes that has high resale price to merchant.  They
have been nerfed as far back as 4 or 5 years ago when MacroQuest
became a popular way to make money while AFK.  Farming items are also
changed, some newbie zone trash drops had their value reduced before
the progressive servers came on to avoid giving the new player an easy
plat farming.

Often time plat farming guides becomes obsolete within a year if SOE
gets a hand on it and finds something too "easy".  Last year I used to
do 20k per hour farming PoN spiders and selling nightmare silks in
bazaar.

Plus the plat farming guide I have mentiosn eqatlas as a good map,
EQAtlas hasn't been updated post PoP since SOE included in game map
around that time.  Also mentioned level 1 wouldn't be good for
tradeskilling due to high risk of dying and corpse retrieval, that has
not been an issue since SOE made level up to 5 (formerly 10) toon keep
everything when the player dies.

As for class specific guides. It seems to predate TSS as well.  Up to
level 70?? yikes, what about 71 to 75 (to 80 this fall)?  Just sit and
do nothing since it's not covered in the guides?  Unless you get in a
good xp group, some people found doing dains were faster xp, about 6%
xp at level 70 per Dain 1 run.

Sorry but I am not paying for the guides without a short preview (1 or
2 actual pages) to show it's not the same as the ones I got for *free*
long ago.

I still have some of the old guides floating on my computer if anyone
wants to look at, send email to impmon2. My ISP is TDS anbd be sure to
add an @ after my email address and a dot net at the end.  Do not use
email reply to this as I haven't posted with valid email address for a
few years now.
