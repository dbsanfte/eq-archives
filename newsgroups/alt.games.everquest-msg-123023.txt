On the rare occasions when I'm actually home when a patch finishes, I've
had cases where I couldn't get in and it acted like the servers were
down, but guildmates with multiple boxes were posting on the guild
boards that they were already in and playing. Right after patch it can
get hugely congested, but you don't always get the "server congested"
message. Often it will just say "cannont connect".
