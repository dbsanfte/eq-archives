New patch has locked me out. I have a message popping up saying 'no 3d
devices found'.
I have installed direct x9 and updated my graphics driver but still no joy.
I have a Hercules 3D Prophet 9200 dual display with 128mb of ram.
I am concerned that the video card is not direct x9 compatible, can anyone
help or do I need a new card?
