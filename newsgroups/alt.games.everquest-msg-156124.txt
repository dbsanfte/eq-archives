As a Monk I use sneak to increase faction with Quest mobs and Vendors. If a
vendor will not sell to you go behind him and hit sneak if successful your
movement will be very slow or you can con the vendor. The vendor will be
indifferent and you can buy and sell then. This will work also with Quest
mobs that only require an indifferent faction to turn items in. You will not
be able to talk to the Quest mob because he will turn to face you when you
hail and if you are KOS he will attack, but if you have the Item to turn in
go behind him and sneak you will be able to turn in the item to complete the
quest. This works excellent for faction building quests where you purchase
can purchase wine, muffins, ect.
