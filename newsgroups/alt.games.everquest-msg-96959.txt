The runes that can stack (have the number in the lower right-hand corner) -
anywhere but on Luclin - are for wizard research.  They can't buy all their
spells, they have to stick 2 or 3 runes together and hit Combine in a
special container and pray they're successful.

There are other runes on Norrath that don't stack.  Those are typically for
quests, typically for ranger ivy clothing.

There are runes that drop in Luclin but I have yet to hear what they're for.
