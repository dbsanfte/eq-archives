(See my reply to the other poster...for a change/addition to the thought).

Why not statues of races/classes in general?
Maybe good idea for some higher LV spawns?
Get to fight an older version of a LV60 Wizard?
A LV60 necromancer who has 2 pet spectres with him and summons high LV
skeletons?
Maybe some ideas for planes. A plane of casters? Plane of priests? Plane of
pet classes? Plane of melee? In each the mobs being nothing but race/class
combinations of those types?
