I was wondering if any rangers out there had found a solution to this
problem?

I have found the following:
- find a gamepad that supports autofire mode.  As of now, the ONLY
gamepad I have been able to find that actualy states on the literature
(and you can see clearly from the picture) is the "LOGIC 3 PC SWIFT
JT266" (http://www.comet.co.uk/cometbrowse/PartnerVisit?location=417697&&partnerID=330&action=1&tagID=no)
which is only sold in the UK btw.

- use a tools like Xylobot which is a directx macro scripting
tool/language, which coincidently can be used to 'cheat' in EQ by
automating things like spell casting so you can walk away from your
comp for a night come back and have all your skills maxed out.

I would really appreciate any feedback on this subject - and any ideas
if SOE ever plans on putting in an auto attack button for archery?

thanks.
