OK, 30 shaman now, really starting to feel the crunch.  Here's my
normal spell loadout:

Greater Heal
Affliction (long lasting DOT)
Envenomed Breath (shorter term DOT)
Tagar's Insects (Slow)
Root
SOW
Quickness (haste)
Regeneration.

So, soloing works like this:

Pull with slow
Run ahead to gain casting room
Envenomed Breath
Run ahead
Affliction
Melee
When Envenomed Breath breaks, try to stick Slow again.
If this fails, chain Root till it sticks, then back off, reapply
slow, envenomed breath, melee
Otherwise, channel Envenomed back on.

Point being to avoid casting anything other than root on an
unslowed mob

If haste or regen or especially SOW drop, root, back, and
reapply.
If hp get low, try to channel GHeal or root, back, GHeal.

I'd like to have another DOT or two.  I'd like to have CanI.  I'd
like to have Disempower.  I'd like to have Befriend Animal.
Heck, people suggest Spirit of Cheetah or Gate as ways out of a
bad situation.

But really, what would I take out?

Regen makes a huge difference when I'm meleeing.  SOW is Life, as
any outdoor hunter should know.  Haste is half my edge over my
opponents (the other half being slow).  Root can be crucial, as
its the "oops, having trouble sticking spells" spell, lacking
Ensnare, rooting is the practical way to gain time for the longer
cast time items on my "to do" list.  Healing, sad to say I do
have to heal myself occaisionally, on some mobs I have to heal
once or twice every time I kill one (other mobs, I heal about
once an hour) but the thing is, when I need to heal, I really
need to.  That leaves the two DOTs. Well, those are a very
significant portion of my DPS; melee plus two DOTs running seems
to get somewhere, while melee with no DOTs is quite slow.

I suppose the answer is to bite the bullet and swap spells around
constantly.  If I cast SOW before every pull, I could swap it out
and put something else in, I've never killed a mob that took
longer than the full duration of SOW.  Sure makes me nervous
though, as SOW is not merely "run to zone" but an important tool,
I can open up range between me and the mob in order to have
interrupt free time to root or heal myself, while at normal speed
I might as well just be standing there with it.

Paax, 30 bear, Morel Thule
