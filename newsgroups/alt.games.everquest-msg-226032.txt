Yup - I second that. The Chimp spends nearly all the time liched for
increased mana regen at the expense of HP. The only two stats I am the least
bit concerned about are INT and Stamina in that order. If you counted +mana
and +hp as a stat then the order would then be:

+INT
+HP
+Mana
+Stamina
Then onto resist gear.
