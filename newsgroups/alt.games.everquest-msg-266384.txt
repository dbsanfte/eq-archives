Even though it depends on how and where you state it, the very nature
of some of what are considered to be core christian beliefs, are to
various degrees inciting hate. What you go on to say about homosexuals
is not much different than how people used to go on about jews and
blacks in decades and centuries past. But some people never learn.


> I don't want homosexuals to die,

right, you just want them to live lonley lives, with no sexual
expression or satisfaction, in fact you'd prefer it if they just got
some prescription drugs and shut up already and got on with the good
straight life of a christian.

bla, bla, bla. Ok you don't agree with violence. And that joke was not
funny. In fact I fail to see how this reflects positive on your
supposed believes. "Supposed", because you
a) wish for people to die
b) are swearing
c) are lying.

Not very christian now is it?

And I'm not taking you too literal. This is your argument, this is
what you stated to support your beliefs and actions.

Yep, because as we all know, kids who have been brainwashed until 13
have about ... what like 10% chance of ever making different religious
or political choices than their parents? But you're definitely
allowing for some thoughtful questioning..

Deal with it. It's just another belief that someone else stated, much
like you did. I don't appreciate this post much either. I agree that
you are hate-mongering, neo-facist was added by yourself, but by the
end of reading this post i actually kinda feel like that about you.

Great for you, but it's factually incorrect. A fetus is by definition
not a human being. It's a fetus. It may or may not become a human
being.

Yep, just as everyone else has the right to state that you are
hate-mongering, and just as everyone else has the right to not listen
to you.

That's exactly wrong. Either side also has the right to not listen,
and to dismiss what on it's face is obviously wrong.


> I think homosexuality is a perversion.  

How and why? Perversion of what? You go into this long diatribe about
it, but you never actually state what your issue is, or why you feel
you get to decide what other people do in their bedrooms.


> I can state that I think so,

> have to the converse. 

I don't think you understand what validity means. Validity only comes
into question when you make an argument for something. You simply
stated a belief, a view. That's not valid or invalid. It's just an
opinion, a statement. If you explained how you ended up with this
extreme, hate-mongering opinion, we could have a discussion on the
validity of the reasoning, but you offer no such supporting arguments.
And validity also doesn't imply truth by the way.

> peacefully.

We could, but since you continue to lobby to have the rights of an
arbitrary group of people restricted, and you continue to want to
force your opinion on what is apropriate on them, there is an argument
to made that peacefully may not be the way to go. It took a civil war
to free the slaves..

By the way... "shrilly" is a very gay word to use.

Ah yes, now it starts to make sense. You don't like gays because of a
parade you once saw in San Francisco. Clearly, all homosexuals wear
"assless leather pants and have a bullwhip protruding from their
anus". Therefore we should disallow people from practicing
homosexuality. Makes about as much sense as outlawing Muslims because
there are a few terrorists that are Muslim extremeists.

It's also interesting to note how much watching that parade meant to
you. You base a whole system of beliefs on it. You must have watched
for a while. Are you sure you were there by accident on your way to a
meeting?


> I love my wife.

Yes, you mean the same kind of love and relationship you are trying to
prevent some other people from having. Without reason.


> I love
> having sex with her. 

Yet another experience you're trying other people to prevent from
having, for no particular reason. What is this, want a bigger, better
slice? All for you, none for them?


> Lots.  Lots.  I mean, a whole f'ing lot.  

Ah, swearing again. Better wash out your mouth. You know, or you may
end up in hell. Isn't that the whole motivation for your life? Not to
end up in hell?


> But
> I wouldn't bang her on a float in the Thanksgiving day parade.

Something 99% of homosexuals wouldn't do to each other either. But you
know what, there are some crazy straight people too. Pedophiles for
example, are statistically much more likely to be straight.

You should always judge a huge group of diverse people by what the
extreme ones do. Really. It'll get you far in life.


> Sorry
> for the aside ;-)  ).  

What's with your smileys every time you make a bad point, that you
know people will object to? Think it helps you somehow? A psychologist
might argue it's proof you know you're wrong and you're trying to
cover it, and the repetitive behaviour only reinforces that.

Which is something the gays have brought upon us. The teachings of the
lube for the double fisting! Seriously are you listening to yourself,
and what you are blaming on homosexuals? I mean you are so out of
touch with reality, it's sickening. This right here is hate-mongering.
Grade A example. Also this is a threat. You countered not wanting your
son to kill gays, with, "At the same time", which is a different way
of saying "but", which in essence is saying: "I don't WANT to have my
son kill the gays, but since they are teaching him about lube in
school..."

Really? I know one that does. You. You just labeled homosexuals:
- parading assless leather pants people who have sex in said parades
on floats
- teach your kids about lube and doule fisting in school

those evil bastards.. 


> I don't think I'm better than anybody on the

Ah so it finally comes full circle. After equating gays with people
with bull-whips sticking out their ass, you can finally say you're
better than those people. Which of course implicitly makes you better
than those gays. And at the same time you don't think you're better
than anybody else. And again you think this is funny. What is wrong
with you?

Yeah since you haven't associated gays with enough bad stereotypes,
let's add another. Just throw it right in there without discussion and
mix it. Why try and make an argument when you can just pile some
stereotypes on it.

Sure for good measure, some political stereotypes.

I laugh at you. You sir, are pathetic. Your fact-checking skills suck.
You do not even have your own opinion. It's just crap you picked up
elsewhere. Nothing original about it.

That shows us, what an openminded friendly gay-hater you are!

That's your interpretation. I didn't see it like that. And anyways, as
I stated above, some of the core christian beliefs, make this
essentially true anyways. Some christian beliefs basically dictate a
sentiment to homosexuals, that is essentialy hate.

Aside from the fact that you are now equating homosexuals with
Democrats, it's not like the country is about as divided as it has
been in a long time. Why do you think it's funny everytime you make
one of your particularly bad points? To kind of make us feel warm and
fuzzy even though you just showed the true asshole you are? In fact
you know how incredibly dumb it is to base an election, the outcome of
which will decide issues such as world peace, america's place in the
world, financial stability of once of the biggest economies in the
world, on whether or not lesbians are allowed to have sex and get
married? Yeah, you really showed them.

I'm thinking more and more, civil war is the way to go on this issue
then. Incidentally the difference of who people vote in metropoli,
where many people have to live close to each other and get along, as
opposed to rural areas .. is astounding. People like you must really
think that you can somehow stop people from feeling and acting gay. I
pity you.

You sir, need drugs. Calm down.

What's with this rhetoric, playing around, hiding your opinion. You're
out to take a few more shots at Democrats while you're on a roll. go
ahead...

Nevermind, that this is how it should be. People constantly
questioning each others beliefs and making sure noone is out of
bounds. Probing issues, and points that are disagreed on. You know, as
opposed to blindly repeating what "the party" says. But you wouldn't
understand that. You're used being told by the bible and the church
just exactly how things are and what to do and how to live your life.
Your "opinion" thus far has consisted of regurgitated hate-mongering,
and you don't even notice it.

Yep, and your rant just proved it.
