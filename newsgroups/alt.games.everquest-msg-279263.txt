But it's a fallacious point, as DoN is popular with the non-raiders so it
*can't* be "hell" for people wearing crap.  I won't debate that it would be
slower, as that's obvious (slower doesn't always equal harder, but is commonly
equated).

Surely.  I myself admit that this isn't a "good" setup, and one would be
wiser to dump a few hundred hitpoints to balance out with some other states
(most notably AC), but it still puts a monk in the 7500-8k hp unbuffed
range, more than enough to make all current single-group content "trivial".

I didn't bother to adjust things to be perfect, as I did it purely to show
what was possible to achieve in hitpoints.  In other words, the charm isn't
quite right, the stats aren't quite right, etc.  Then again, I've never
gotten that junk right on my own magelo either.  =P

Really...  why?  And why would you (and others, e.g.., parallel discussion on
monk class boards) pick now to speak out about this issue that has become
*less* of an issue over the past couple of expansions?  Is it because you
the the gap narrowed, or feel that you got the gap narrowed, due to whining
and figure if it worked once why not try it again?  If that's the case,
well, you may be on to something so feel free to complain about an imbalance
that doesn't even begin to compare to when I was a "hardcore" raiding monk
with ~3k *bufffed* hp and the top monk on my server had 6k *un-buffed*.

Another element I think people on your side of this issue fail to realize is
that raiding has to "appeal" to a wide range of people, including "loot
whores" (some of whom are very nice people and very good players, but want
their toys).  This means that an upgrade, in a system where you won't
average more than an upgrade-per-month, needs to be noticeable.  There are
those, like me, who would raid naked if necessary, but we need those "loot
whores" to want to raid too, otherwise we can't.  =)
