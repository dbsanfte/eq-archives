Like I said, watching the dreams of a game designer hit reality can
be interesting. All sorts of unexpected interactions become evident.

In essence the game has some significant bugs, a lack of content and
numerous imbalances as would be expected of a very young gameworld.
But in a PvP environment these weaknesses become a lot more critical.
Meanwhile mythics ability to keep customers faith appears to be 
slipping. And as a result some interesting analysis and argument,
and an awful lot of whining of course, can be found on the chat
boards.

but that's not the really interesting thing.

The really interesting thing is how they intended to balance a world
which had both PvE and PvP as mandatory components of the game. How
they were going to restrict `griefing' and how they were going to
balance and maintain a dynamic state of `war'. After all they have
to make it rewarding without allowing any side to actually win. I
wondered what game mechanics would be used, but it seems they don't
know either.
