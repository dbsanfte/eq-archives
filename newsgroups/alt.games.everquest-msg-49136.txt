I play a Troll Shadow Knight on Luclin server. So far, I've spent most
of my young life in and around Nek Forest with my Dark Elven friends
(they are a tasty snack). When I was a younger Troll, I would always
see these paladins and other good people come in and kill the guards
on the bridge and near Lavastorm. I want to know if there are any
guards (preferrably guards that protect "good" people) that I, as a
level 15 Troll Shadow Knight, could kill. Both as a payback type
thing, and as just a nice loot and/or exp type thing. Someone in the
game had said "Not any more." but I'm not sure what he meant.
