A while ago I had a discussion with my brother.  He'd recently been to a
restaurant where he got bad service.  I asked him if he complained, or at
least filled out a comment card so that they could fix the problem.  He said
"No.  It's their job to fix the problem.  It's not my job to tell them that
they have a problem".

I pointed out that if he doesn't tell them that the problem exists, then
they'll never fix it.  He responded that it's their job to know that they
have a problem, and that I'm stupid for thinking he should tell them about
it.


You sound as stupid as my brother.

(Especially in view of your later missive, where you state that you'll lie
about your opinion / system specs, to "punish" them for having the gall to
ask you questions that might aid them in making things better.)
