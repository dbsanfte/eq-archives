I've never had a problem.  I thought I had a problem once, but it turned 
out flashing the bios resets it from 'AGP display' to 'PCI display' so of 
course I got a black screen when I booted up... duh. :) Took me about an 
hour of panicking before I thought to throw an ancient graphics card on 
it.

It might be worth checking carefully to make sure those fried mb's are as 
fried as you at first thought... I'm sure that's not the only weird thing 
that could happen.
