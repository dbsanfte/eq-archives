The grievous crimes thing was tounge in cheek.  Still, just putting "OT"
before an off topic post doesn't make it all kosher.  You're still starting
a post that's not on the topic of the ng.  Of course, the silly thing about
it all is, you could have made it all above board if you would have given it
the subject "OT - Lokari, what does your .sig mean?"  Same question, but
you've given it a clear connection to the NG.  That's what the OT tag is
for... something that's off-topic, but still related in some way.
