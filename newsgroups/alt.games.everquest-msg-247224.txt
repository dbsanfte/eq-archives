That's the trouble with etymology especially of ubiquitous words like 
car. :) And etymological summaries tend to take the shortest path, which 
is not neccesarily the strictly correct one for a given usage of a word.

car, carriage, carry, cart ... all come from the same place. Did car as 
applied to what evolved into Model-Ts come about as a contraction of 
carriage or did it jump over from pre-existing usage in railway car and 
mining car... or did it jump from another language that did the 
contraction first.

I don't think anyone can *really* say for sure, with 'car' sitting there 
in english use already applied to other wheeled things, 'carriage' 
sitting there already applied to the early cars, and god-knows what 
car-variant was being used in france or spain or italy at the time. When 
it finally started getting applied to what we know as cars today its 
virtually impossible to state with any authority where exactly it came from.

Considering the etymology of cartoon is french/italian carton/cartone. 
Which means cardboard. Its safe to say that etymologies generally leave 
something to be desired.

I'd wager cartoon is probably contracted from 'cartone divertente' or 
something along those lines.

I'll concede I don't recall ever hearing the term toon myself when 
playing doom. However, by diablo 1 at least it was common enough. (But 
I'm going to also mention that when I played doom it was still almost 
exclusively single player, and/or with close friends so the internet 
hadn't really impacted gaming yet... and LANs were still new (we had 
coax at the time... it was a *bitch* to set up and get working in DOS... 
you had to either buy or steal the network protocol... everything was 
IPX...iirc.

As an aside, while I was looking about on the subject I bumped into a 
p&p RPG called 'Toon... I wonder if that is the source. It appears to 
fit...both with claims that toons appeared in rpg video games... (even 
diablo is arguablly rpg...) and other game mechanic element 
similiarities... animated characters... never really die... etc... and 
it predates any other usages by years.

Be pretty ironic if the word toon actually originated from the 
roleplayers :)

pally as alt sp. for pali?... even I've used "pali"?
