So what's VAT tax?  Seems monstrous that europe seems to have passed a tax
on the internet (if my interpretation is correct), and the size of it is
incredible.  17.5%??!  Was this something you all voted on, or are you
living under some kind of a dictatorship now?

If my interpretation is off, then apologies for slander.  If not, then you
guys really need to do something about the bozos running things.  I thought
we had it bad in US.
