When I was doing it, I camped the skeleton under the spiral stairs. This is
the room by loc 75,-75 on EQAtlas:

Head straight through room 1, follow passage and take 1st left. There are
two Ogre guards at the top of the stairs. Apparently it drops of any of the
"a skeleton" and no other skeletons, but I only camped this one spot.
