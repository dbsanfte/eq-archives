Chanter is 65 and can mez dependably in Tier 3, not sure how that
compares to LDoN-Hard. 

Tash agro generally isn't a problem, Our cleric/chanter/shaman  has
been grouping on-and-off for years and he's good about timing his tash
off of my slow so it lands just before. At least that was the case
pre-PoP, the mindless pulling in PoP has probably dulled our skills.
... and getting those back against mobs that hit for 900+ should be
exciting. <g>
