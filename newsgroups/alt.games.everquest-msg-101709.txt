I feel ya.  I get annoyed at the wrong usage of 'your' and 'your're'.  Also,
'there', 'their', and 'they're' seem to be interchangable.  When wasting time
in EC, one of my favorite things to do is call people out when they ask for

port_b3gg3r_01 shouts:  Can ne1 port me plz?
smartass_me_01 shouts:  No not anyone, only druids or wizards.
