If anything, PoP has increased my druid's take from ports.

Yes, it seems absurd, but you have to think how the community adjusts
to these sorts of things.

Thanks to those books, no one wants to run through 2 zones to get
where they're going anymore.

I get asked for ports to Surefall from Everfrost.  I get asked for
ports to Stoneburnt from the Plane of Knowledge.  I get asked for
ports to North Karana from the Nexus.

People just aren't interested in running anywhere anymore.
