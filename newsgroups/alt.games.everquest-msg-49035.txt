    I don't disagree there. But if Jakugg is fighting in godforsaken zones
like EJ, you can bet enjoying the game isn't first and foremost on his mind,
levelling is.

    Of course, I still maintain that most raid skills are learned by,
surprise, raiding and not by any form of XP grind. As for no gear, that can
be fixed as fast as you are willing to fix it. One night of "all *insert
type of armour* drops go to a_gimp01" fixes most equipment issues - but most
guilds lack the will to give those most in need the drops. But that's an
entire other topic.

>Add to that a lack of understanding of their classes abilities and

    The one thing that contributes most to a lack of understanding of the
game isn't outdoors adventuring. It's soloing. And I agree - soloists are
the biggest dimwits when it comes to rock-bottom basics.

    Until very recently, Jakugg didn't HAVE a 49 cleric with him, just a
pre-49 cleric. And as a cleric I can tell you right now that unless I knew
him he'd have to pay through the nose or make sure I had ports in and out
before I'd drop whatever I was doing to go res him in Emerald Jungle. It
isn't the lost 10% XP that hurts these folks - I know as well as you do how
truly insignificant that is. It's getting that 90% back that takes all the
time and hassle.

    Yes, agreed. But at some point that is exactly what you have to care
about. People get tired of dicking around, killing the same junk all the
time, while their friends level up, get in a raiding guild, and fight stuff
that everyone dreams about fighting.

    I disagree here. In my experiences, the average person playing EQ groups
on a daily basis with folks they do not know well beforehand (pickup
groups). These people have no regard for what will hurt others, just
themselves. So when things head south, as they sometimes will, any support
you wish to rely on will evaporate.

    My first story to back this up: Sebilis, D2. Group monk and rogue,
friends, convince a group to go into D2 without evac because "there's no
worries, we have a NEC anyways". CLR, ENCH, MNK, ROG, ROG, NEC - a real
killing machine, we have snare, things die so fast having a monk tank isn't
an issue. Inevitably, something bad happens - monk has adds, feigns part of
the pull on the group to fight, and as she stands up the first time (having
not told us there's more), the ENCH hits her with haste. Three hasted Krups
come storming into the room and turn the ENCH into paste before I can even
blink. I Gate, everyone else manages somehow to run out except one rogue.

    So, back at zone-in. NEC apparently never got Summon Corpse, as he's a
soloist. As soon as that is revealed, MNK and ROG buddies "have to go" and
split. So we now have naked ENCH, NEC, CLR, and a ROG in Firiona Vie, and
bodies in D1 and D2 (D1 also uncamped). Would you like to hazard a guess as
to how long it took to get those folks out? Can you imagine how much worse
it would have been had I (the CLR) accepted the group offer I got while
trying to assemble a team capable of going in to get them? That is what I'm
talking about when I say an entire play day can be wasted in doing a CR.

    So you have people who can't do the first thing they've been told at a
raid: shut up and follow orders. I doubt that's an "outdoors levelling"
thing.

>Also, you would be AMAZED at how many people dont root park and have never
>tried it.

    That surprises me, but I'll concede the point. Every outdoor group my
alts have been in has done it, but the very fact that I'm there to TELL them
to do it may bias the results.

>I am also fighting an uphill battle against retarded clerics who
>levelled too fast, and dont cast CH "cos I get aggrod"

    Heh. As a cleric, I hear what they're saying. The raid has to figure out
how to make sure that the first CHeal a cleric casts doesn't get them
greased, as dying isn't fun and waiting for a newly ressed cleric to regain
mana is even less fun. But I can't imagine a solid raid guild having such
poor aggro management that casting the first CHeal is a death sentence. That
sounds like a trust issue.

>and then have the
>gall to say they don't use their Barriers either.

    That happens with dungeon clerics, though, too. Really, in a deep
dungeon crawl if you get in trouble you have several options: root park,
stun and wait for mez, self-heal, Gate, get evacced, barrier. If you
barrier, you cannot do any of the others for as long as DA/DB is up, AND
you've transferred all aggro on you to your party. As a cleric, I cringe
when I see I've just DA'ed a pair of mobs onto the ENCH, as HE will save us
if anyone will. More often than not I end up clicking it off, using it as an
Evade. I can certainly see junior clerics with little raid experience not
using it, until they begin to understand the "die in place" mentality of a
raid.

>I'm talking upper 50s
>clerics who are so clueless as to disregard their BEST spells in favour of
>going oom from chaincasting Divine Light.

    Now see, if they'd just levelled more they'd be using the more
mana-efficient Celestial Elixir! :P

    Again, dungeon experience doesn't help here. In Seb, if three or four
come in you avoid CHeal because it WILL get you creamed, and you WON'T have
the flexibility you need if someone else gets aggro. You drop a Celestial
E/H on the person tanking, then start evaluating who needs heals and how
much. They have to learn a new set of rules when they get to raids, as now
mana efficiency can be crucial.

>The exact point I'm making here is that these lessons you say are "not hard

    And I ascribe it to raids being different from any other experience in
the game.

    Where I see a difference is when I get a soloist in the party. They have
never learned to work with others, and so do some pretty bizarre things
because when they get in trouble they assume nobody will help them.
But people who levelled outdoors? Nope, I can't tell by how much of a moron
a person is where they levelled, or even IF they levelled *cough* E-Bay
*cough*.

    I do. Specifically, I'm quite jealous of what they CAN do that I cannot.
I'd love to stand outside the alcove in ToV and see what we're fighting, but
with my resists it would be suicide. I'd love to have the maxed WIS mana
pool that other clerics have, so I could hang in there that one more heal.
I'd love to push my self-buffed HP/AC over 3 K/1 K so I could tank more
efficiently when I draw aggro, and not be forced into DA/self-heal/stunning.
I can't do these things I want to do all because of gear. Given I'm a
caster, a similar case can be made for levels and spells (although any
cleric with Aegolism likely curses level 60 every day they raid).

>Ah the old 'your opinion differs from mine so you have no clue' gambit, eh?

    Yup. 8) I'm in a unique position - I didn't level up with the folks from
Beta, but I joined EQ pre-Kunark. I've been guilded, but not for all my
levels. I have friends I play with many days, but many days are still
pick-up as the friends are all sub-50. I've raided with my server's top
guilds, but I'm not a member. I feel this all gives me a perspective that
people that have been part of one system all their EQ careers don't have. I
am guilty of lumping anyone who claims to be part of "powah raid guild X"
into the "doesn't know how things are at lower levels today" bin - for that,
I do apologize. But I hope you can see that I might have a perspective here
that's useful to the issue at hand.

>Does this uber rogue have his poison, trap and PLock skills all maxed?

    PLock and trap, yes - they're easy to max in a day, and necessary.
Poison? Even our server's old-school rogues usually don't max that unless
they need it for the ninth ring. Too expensive and time consuming for the
results, and poisoning at the beginning of the fight can really mess up
one's aggro control. (Poisoning mid-fight is senseless, as you'll do a
bucketload more damage by continuing to fight AND you end up sitting to
apply poison).

>One

    If he gets tired of Befallen, then remind him that he can practice in
EFP on the Burning Rapier door. If he doesn't know what that is, I can't
help him. 8/

>Does this guy do the guilds CRs or is that left to
>someone more experienced?

    They never die. 8/  Seriously, though - at that level, either a cleric
camped out or a necromancer starts clicking on his pants. Or a monk, who can
get by ANY mob, goes in.

>Was this his first character ever or was it a server switch?

    First character, period. His friend played, so he knew the score, and he
had a plan to get as powerful as possible as fast as possible.

> Could he CR a guild twink dead in Dalnir?

    Would he ever have to? Again, seriously - they're raiding five days a
week. So nobody's playing a twink for five days. Sixth and seventh are open
days, where most people take time off from EQ, level up twinks as fast as
humanly possible (so outdoors, or via PL/Fungi techniques), get back lost
XP, or buy/sell/camp loot. He's not going to be asked to CR from Dalnir,
because his guildmates aren't in Dalnir and even if they DID die there, a
main would be brought on a second computer and a path would be cleared to
the bodies. It's like asking if his ID skill is capped - it's something he
won't be using, so does it matter?

>Could he even find Dalnir (for example)?

    I know I still need a map or the co-ords, and my monk levelled a LOT in
Warslik's. 8)

>Who the hell cares about glory?

    He does.

>What's he gonna do when he's got all that gear?

    He'll never get "all that gear". Think about Vulak alone - drops three
items per kill, spawns once per week, has at LEAST three items per class
that would be considered "best possible general gear". Once per week, you
could totally satisfy ONE person in the guild. Maybe. In EQ there's always
improvements "just around the corner".

>Be bored and quit.

    Our server is different. People used to quit when they tired of the
inter-guild fighting. Now that most of that has cleared up, they now quit
because all the fights are "the same". And because they want to try DAoC.

>Notwithstanding the argument about the usefulness of dungeon skills at high
>level, dungeons are certainly where ALL the fun of EQ is hidden. And most
of
>the good loot too.

    I don't want to open up the can of worms involved in "fun", but the REAL
loot of EQ is on raids, not in single-group dungeons.
