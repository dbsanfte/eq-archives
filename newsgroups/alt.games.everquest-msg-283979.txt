I can, because I'm a druid, and I've grouped with clerics like you
before.

Oh, you're one of those clerics, Purple club isn't funny, or useful in
a pickup group which this clearly was.  Start your CH a little earlier.

Oh, he saw it, and at 6 seconds in and 20% on the tank, he realized
that the tank needed a heal.  and did it.  I'm sure he's sorry, that
your CH only landed for 5200 wasting your mana.  Lack of faith in a
pickup cleric, is like lack of faith in my petition being answered.

Sounds like you had a buggy instance.  Not the Druid or the Necro's
fault.  Succor is almost never fatal.

Finally, I have to chime in to agree with everyone else and point out,
that Cleric's while useful and necessary aren't nearly as important as
they used to be, and certainly aren't a requirement for much of
anything.  Obviously the Necro and Druid were doing you a favor instead
of going off and soloing a creator mission, or a 69.1 Nest.  And
judging by your attitude here, you're lucky they stayed through till
the mission timer kicked off.
