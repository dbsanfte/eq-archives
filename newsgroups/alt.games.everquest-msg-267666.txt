I read a walkthrough of the newbie area and it made out that even just 
gaining citizenship for Qeynos, one of the first things to do, would 
involve grouping to kill a boss-mob, as no solo character would be tough 
enough. So I had the same impression you do, but I've found that to be 
totally wrong so far, I've waded through my first 7 levels quickly, 
gained my citizenship, completed dozens of quests, and all while soloing.

I never noticed any penalty in EQ1 but then I was playing a low level 
character a lot. In EQ2, so far I've noticed a small debt but it pays 
itself off by you capturing your 'spirit shard'...in other words, 
grabbing your corpse from where you died.
