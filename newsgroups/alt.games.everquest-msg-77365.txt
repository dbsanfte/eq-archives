It wouldn't bother me, assuming I had a Sow or Boots.  Then again, that is 
time that I should probably be medding, unless the challenge of DL is 
pretty low on a Chanter.  I don't plan on ever hunting there with my 
Chanter or Warrior.  Draglorvin is in a Strictly Dungeon group, and Zym is 
busy doing Guild stuff for a while.
