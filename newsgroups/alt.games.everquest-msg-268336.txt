    Various mobs in Kedge Keep.
    Wolves in Kael.
    Hynids in Natimbi.
    Black Unicorn in Wakening Lands.

    There are some pretty good Dire Charmable pets out there, in zones where 
you might actually want to be. Give those critters some pet weapons and your 
best pet haste and they can crank out some fair DPS, with the only risk 
being mobs that can dispel. I know there's mobs that are blue to a 62 in 
Natimbi and Kael - go to town.
