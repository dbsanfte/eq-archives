good call Rogues are definately one of the hardest classes to play. I
play a bard most of the time and yes you must constantly hit keys and
adapt to every situation. But its not that hard really. I mean if your
in a good group, there will be a couple melee types, and maybe a
healer and chanter/shaman. You obviously haste the melee types during
battle with a few twisted songs and buff, and play the mana song
constantly during downtime. The only thing that takes priority over
those things are certain situations. Like if a mob is running away at
low health in a dungeon (bad) the you snare them. If there are adds,
you mezz them. Its more of a common sense class then a hard class.
Bards get a few very useful songs, and a lot of lame songs. I think
between shammy and rogue one of the two is the hardest. Shaman have
the most buffs in the game, and everyone is bitching for them every
two seconds (can you tell i play one?) Shammies are such a complicated
class that you could take their healing powers away and still separate
them from other classes. I mean the only real difference between
enchanters and shaman is that enchanters can mezz and shaman's can
heal. Shaman's can increase their own mana using cannibalize. Its very
hard to keep a group fully buffed, heal, slow mobs, and med/canni. You
cannot daydream while playing a shammy. Rogues on the otherhand are
definately the hardest melee class. They have no abilities which help
them avoid the bullshit or Norrath. If they are spotted in any zone by
anything that can kill them, they will be killed. I find getting
killed in stupid situations to be the most annoying factor of the
game. Thats why I play a bard. I can run away from anything. Even the
damn casters cant get me now (at level 51) Im so damn fast I outrun
their casting range most of the time. Dungeons are a different story.
