As an outside oberserver looking in, I didn't really see any reason why 
Arnold would make a poorer governor then any of the last several 
governors, or any of the other candidates.

Was there a particular reason you actively didn't want him, or just a 
case where there was someone else you would have preferred?

Had it happened here, I probably would have voted for him.... not that I 
think being an actor qualifies one to be a good politician... but then I 
don't think the lawyers and career politicos have been doing a bang up 
job either.

Then again... I think the guys writing the West Wing have come up with a 
more beleivable president then Bush Jr. has been....I'd be willing to 
bet money that Martin Sheen could beat Bush Jr. in an election... Hell I 
wouldn't be surprised if there were people out there who think Sheen is 
already president. :)
