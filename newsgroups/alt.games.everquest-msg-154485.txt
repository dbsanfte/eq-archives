Silly question, but I'm just curious, whenever any of you see somebody
ooc'ing "level whatever rouge LFG" what's your reaction?  Have you
ever answered back "Sorry, we don't need a ROUGE but we are looking
for a ROGUE" or just don't even want them in your group (if they can't
be bothered to learn how to spell the name of their class they're
probably a crummy player)?  Or do you think it doesn't matter much?

Going off topic, but did anybody else get annoyed at the number of
times President Bush kept saying "NEW-KEW-LER weapons" in his speech
earlier in the week?  Not meaning to sound disrespectful to the
President, but that's just another little thing that annoys me mildly.
