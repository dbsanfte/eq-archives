First off Slam is a joke it is an ability of large races never increases the
skill level so a level 5 has the same chance of success as a level 60.
Spells are great as long as you have time to cast them. If you are the main
tank taking all the abuse you have to stop inflecting damage while casting
and lower your self on the hate list. Harm Touch is great as long as you
fight 1 mob every 90 min. Harm Touch is a last ditch effort to save your
life inflecting 10 times your level plus 1 in damage. The only time an SK
may have more hit point then a Warrior is when the creator put all bonus
points into sta instead of int and str in which the SK will most likely
never last past 30.
SK are the second best Tank in the game and can be the main Tank of a group.
Paladin follow third but Ideally they are the backup Tank and backup healer.
Paladin need to be able to step back from a fight and cast a bit to be most
effective giving the main healer a brief med break.
