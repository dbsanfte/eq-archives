Might be true, might not, I have no idea...

I had heard that 'woot' comes from UNIX hacker lingo - the highest privilege
is root, and when a hacker finally gained root access they proclaimed 'root'
which eventually became 'woot'.

Just another version that I didn't see posted yet so I thought I'd toss it
out.
