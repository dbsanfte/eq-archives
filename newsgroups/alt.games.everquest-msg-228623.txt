A total of 3 by 50 by my count (2, 18, 47).  2 and 47 are stringed,
18 brass.  The upcoming patch makes the extended range AA not work 
on them for this very reason.  I remember long ago I used to multi-
kite with 2&18 - it's not easy and you get hit a lot.  I can't imagine
using it anywhere they hit hard.
