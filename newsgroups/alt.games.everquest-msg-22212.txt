Actually, in a sense, yes. This is a RPG, which means that it's based on
the *character's* skill, as opposed to the *player's* skill. That means
that the outcome of any fight must depend on the roll of the dice. Of
course, you are free to stack the dice in your favour, with resists and
procs and better weapons, but when you are jumping across the river to
evade the orc, you are calling on the *player's* reflexes to decide the
outcome. This is Verant's line of reasoning for considering that an
exploit.

As far as I'm concerned, though, bully for him and more power to his
arm.
