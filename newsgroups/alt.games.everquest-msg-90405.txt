I just installed everquest, and when I run it, a window appears titled
"EverQuest Patch" which fails to patch with this error:

--
EverQuest Patch version 1.2.2
(c) 2000 Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.
All Rights Reserved.

Checking for new files, please wait...

EverQuest file update failed.  If the problem persists, contact your 
network administrator or internet service provider for assistance.
(patch.everquest.com:7000TCP) 

* ERROR *:  Not Connected.

If this is your first time playing EverQuest, refer to "Troubleshooting 
Your Connection" in "EverQuest_Manual.txt"in your EverQuest folder.

My connection is fine, I can connect to other sites, and even ping 
patch.everquest.com. I'm connected through a LAN behind a linux box doing 
NAT with iptables which is connected with a cable modem via charter
pipeline (if that helps). The machine running EQ has win98 on it. 
 
There is nothing about Troubleshooting Your Connection in any of the .txt
files distributed with EQ. Running nmap, I see that port 7000 (apparently
where the patch server runs) is blocked:

[root@cq4712 root]# nmap patch.everquest.com -p 7000

Starting nmap V. 2.54BETA22 ( www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Interesting ports on sdslbvip-6.sonyonline.net (64.37.156.21):
Port       State       Service
7000/tcp   filtered    afs3-fileserver         


Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 2 seconds
--

This happened to us when we tried to run EQ weeks ago, and I figured the
problem would resolve itself, but I've been trying it again periodically
over the last 12 hours, and still nothing. 

Any insights?

TIA,

Marc
