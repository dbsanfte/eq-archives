Do all the spellcasters in the game have the spells in the hardest places to
get to? Like the enchant metal spells in Neriak and now in Felwithe, pet
spells in HighHold Keep and the mana spells in the brownie compound in
lesser faydark.
I've been trying to get the thicken mana spell in the brownie compound, no
luck. The suggestions where to use invisible then alliance on the guards
well as soon as you cast you become visible and the other guard gets you.
Also to use minor illusion to get the spell from merchant but you cann't
move with minor illusion. Wolf form from a druid but you have to find one
first.
Also been trying to do the Stein of Moggok quest, Getting that fish corpse
from Temple of light is impossible even for a mule they've got the guard
right in the pool with the fish now, one wack on fish and your dead so doing
it the longer way with the dog called frostbite. Talk about running you all
over two continents. I was using my druid to see how getting the quest items
worked because she can teleport and didn't notice till to late that the
items are no drop but they say two people can give the quest items to the
barkeep for the book is this true? I was thinking of having my druid give
him the no drop items then my enchanter give him the nut but will have to
log off the druid and log on the enchanter to do this will it work? If it
doesn't work the enchanter will have to do the whole quest and I'm to low on
money to even think about all the teleports I would have to ask for.
Just very frustrated! Wanted to sell my services for enchanted silver,
enchanted clay and thicken mana for money.
Thanks for hearing my rants.
