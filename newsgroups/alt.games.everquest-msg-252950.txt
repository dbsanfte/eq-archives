I'm trying to get the pally bone in Phinney's hole by doing the ole
"go naked and invis" trick.  I'm doing it solo because no one in my
guild (nor anyone else for that matter) wants anything to do with
Kledge.  They say that the spell isn't worth having and they probably
are right but it's a pally quest and I'm a pally so it is one of the
things we do or at least try to do a couple of times before accepting
reality.  Anyway, everything was easy until I got to the Patriarch
room.  That's the one just before Phinegal's room.  According to the
maps at Allakazams there is a tube running from the Northeast Corner. 
My problem is that I can't find it.  There is this big square pot with
a couple of weeds in it sitting in that corner.  I've looked high and
low, up both sides of the pot, on both corner walls up to the ceiling,
on the ceiling edging, on the ceiling itself, in the mud but nothing
that looks like "a hole in the wall".  Do I have to click on something
or push something?  If anyone remembers how you get in, I would
appreciate some help.  Many thanks.
