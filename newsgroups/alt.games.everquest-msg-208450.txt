I have a similar problem (although I cannot claim to be able to read two 
books in a day, even on vacation... My normal rate is about two a week 
during normal work + EQ weeks). The problem is that I'm very picky with 
what I read, and having read a bad book leaves me with a greater feeling 
of having wasted my time than even a bad EQ day. I have to agree that 
even if you hit the second-hand shops pretty hard, EQ probably still 
works out cheaper.
