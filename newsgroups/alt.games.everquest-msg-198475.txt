I have a 44 cleric on drinal. what i found is the "charred guardian shield"
is good to have. it allows you to train bash skill up with nice ac and good
wisdom boost. for primary weapon i use the velium etched stone mace. since
ima dwarf i opted for the dwarven plate armor which gives good ac str and
wis boost. with 80k you should have as much a problem as obtaining these
items though. you may want better.
