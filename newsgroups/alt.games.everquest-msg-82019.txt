my 51 druid (almost) always has gate (or else evac) memmed.  However,
my impression, after just playing an enchanter up to level 14, is that
enchanters have a MUCH tougher time picking out the spells to use. 
So many debufs and attacking spells.  For a druid, you always have heal,
snare, one or two dd/dot spells, and root up, and the other slots can
be things like invis, gate, buff... not nearly as hard.
