Well, I finally bit the bullet and started to skill up my tailoring skill.
Got it to 82 using the Tattered armor, to Leather Padding, to Braided
Mandrake, to Picnic baskets, to Greyhopper Armor route. Still have another
13 pts. that I Can mine out of the old Greyhopper combines. After that Im
not sure what Ill be skilling up on. I decided however that Id try to make a
small spot of coin by trying to sell the Leather paddings that I made. So I
head up to the bazaar, and take a look at whats the going price for Leather
Padding. Hmmm 3 traders selling padding not good.. .Say What ? Prices of
115, 110, 125 plat PER PADDING ?  Ok I figures, they must be just
advertising what thier tradesmiths have on them for thier guilds. No one can
be serious about selling padding for THAT price. So I talk to some friends
and they figure that on a Red Server ( Vallon Zek ) that 10 plat per padding
would be about right. So I happily set up shop and go to bed.

Next morning I wake up and find that ALL of my padding is gone and Im 300
plat richer : ) This is nice I says to myself, and farming for these
particular supplies is surprisingly easy with a couple of alts. So I go out
and farm some more and get another 48 leather paddings. Once again I take a
look at the BAzaar's listings for leather padding and Low and behold 3
DIFFERENT people from the ones Id seen the night before are selling padding
at the "bargain basement price" of over 100 plat per padding. My wife sees
this and says to me "Why dont you sell for that much ?" Basically my
response was "Well they must be just letting thier guild know what thier
trade smiths have in the way of supplies", but Im starting to wonder a bit
at this point. I decide to experiment a bit and price all 48 of my Leather
Paddings at 25 plat each, a price that to mean seems utterly absurd, and
head off to bed again. Next morning I see that I am 1200 plat richer, and a
single customer has bought ALL of my leather padding!

So while Im pleased as punch to finally find a way to make some decent cash,
Im wondering if this is just a fluke that Im selling at such an absurd
profit, or is there somthing very basic that I am missing, and those people
selling for 100 plat per are laughing at me for selling so cheaply ?

Any information anyone can shed on this subject is greatly appreciated!!
