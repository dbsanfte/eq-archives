Yep, bursting of your bubble eh? What initially seems like a great
zone to people ends up having many of the problems such as you've just
encountered. No matter what Verant says its not really comparable to
Lake of Ill omen at all. For one thing, when you have temporarily
exhausted lake of ill you can go to FM and overthere, when you've
exhausted stonebrunt for a while you are begging for a port to WC.

Some kobold camps in the southeast or wherever .. but you'll have red
wandering things moving around also. This is really just not a very
well executed zone for the levels who would be the most appropriate
for it. I find my 32 SK troll did well there solo on the parade of
blue cons along a rock wall to the south east.. but that gets old
also. Really you should try to get into a group while there are still
groups there before (very soon) no one is really doing the zone at all
except a couple high level players trying to get those monk footpads
(only thing worth getting in the zone for a high level anyway and I
think blue to at least a 55 and maybe a 59, once again (repeat after
me..) making the loot code there...

TOTALLY MOOT!)

There is really not more for her to do there besides that and it makes
the jump from a bunch of blue mobs to higher red or low green.
As a troll starting as scowl and ZERO way to raise the kitty faction
(no mobs there give kejeken, nope not heretics, not anything) she
can't visit the city or do quests (neither can my 55 druid, thanks
trivial loot code and me missing out on content verant even with a
lower character /rude /rude /rude, not feeling very positive about
that code being in Luclin also) so basically she's bailed.

She is having fun making it from stonebrunt back to Lake of ill omen
getting bound here and there and killing stuff all the way. She is
currently made it to qeynos after several hours (yep, another reason
why tox is so bad, without a port even getting to qeynos takes a long
time on what is really the worst boat system in the game) Its kinda
fun to kill brother estle and all those paladins running that race to
raise bertox, giggle. I also found that a 32 sk can kill the good
guards at the guard towers pretty well... and no one does so fun and
they are blue cons for quite a while really at 32.  

Troll sk is some of the most fun I've had in EQ since most of your
factions are so shot to heck you just go crazy A bonkers and can kill
whatever and not care ; ) ITs really a far cry from my prissy do
gooder druid. I mean since sk has invis and such and FD factions are
only really of use for trainers and some evil guilds maybe.
