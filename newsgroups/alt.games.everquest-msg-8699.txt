Bandwidth is, of course, a valid concern for every company using a network.
I believe that bandwidth is the reason Verant has been shutting guilds down.
(Increased /guild channel traffic).  I do not think this is a problem for my
lil scheme, though.  Critique what I say below, but I am pretty sure that
this "base" is covered:

    This part is absolutely correct.  A company gauges their peak bandwidth
usage and they decide how big of a pipe they will need based on that.  Then,
once they have bought that pipe, they must maintain that monthly-cost (and
sometimes volume charges on top of that) whether it is used or not.  Most of
the time, it is not used.  Not even close.  Telephone companies know this
more than anyone, but  you must measure your horsepower based on peak.

    Verant/Sony will add more bandwidth for SWG if the peak traffic
increases to require more.  Now, they may do some business/technical models
that show high probability for more bandwidth need, but that is theirs to
do.  If they do they'll add more but that is their choice.  (Heh, I quickly
add, that if I were them, I would.  They have the capital and look what
their tiny EQ venture produced...)
    Later, if it is shown that EQ decreases while SWG increases, both
decrease, Microsoft comes out with a competitive game and they lose tons of
customers, etc... if it is shown that they do not need as much bandwidth
then they'll decrease how much they have.  That actually lowers their
overhead costs.  It is completely, totally, and wholly based on the traffic
that they USE.
    Also, do not kid yourself.  Sony will use the same pipe for both SWG and
EQ.  There is no reason not to as it is just an internet pipe.

> Double the cost, basically.

    Only if SWG is completely as successful as EQ AND EQ continues to have
it's current volume.

    Heh, now profits are a different thing altogether.  They may charge the
additional to receive more profit but their technical overhead model is
QUITE different.
    I submit that, based on what they have said the various charges are for,
combined with how networking companies work, there's no technical reason to
charge us twice.

    Taking what I have said above about HOW they work.  Combine that with a
single login server for both games. Now apply that to customers like me.  I
either sign on to SWG or EQ.  Not both.  I can't.  They have that tracked at
the point of entry.  I am using a single-user's bandwidth inside the Sony
network in both scenarios.

    The game that I am inside of is already developed, tested, and loaded.
I have paid my $40.00 or whatever to pay for that.
    The hardware, the operating system software, the network cables,
routers, and piece of the internet pipe are paid for by my $10.00 paid
every, single month.  The latter category is COMPLETELY based on traffic.
Think not?  If EQ loses 1/20th of their customers within a week.  Do you
have any notion that Verant will not begin combining servers and shut down
(and re-use) old servers?  They will.  And the equipment/OS/bandwidth will
be shutdown and reused as well.
