 Indeed. Level 60 Wiz here.. I've had manaburn a long time now. Everyone thinks
Manaburn is this HUGE NUKE THAT'LL KILL EVERYTHING IN ONE BLAST. The reality is
that without a crit Manaburn will do an averge of 8000 hp and use all my mana.
If, on some very large MOB during a long fight, I use, say, Sunstrike I can easily
do that much damage with maybe 3 casts and perhaps 1/6th of my total mana pool.
If a wizard has focus items (which by the way do not effect Manaburn) and Spell
Spell casting fury and gets a few nice crits (which is bound to happen in a long 
fight with pehaps 20 casts), uses concussion and spaces out his casting so that 
he doesn't get agro over the MT and gets killed, he can easily do 5 - 10 times 
the damage that Manaburn would do.
 
 Manaburn is a HUGE WASTE OF MANA.
