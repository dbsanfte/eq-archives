It just gets confusing because in most groups the MA is the MT, so
people get lazy and use them interchangeably.  Another confusing fact
is that people tend to treat the puller, not the MA, as the main
assist.  This can lead to some problems.  (Puller doesn't always have
the MA's target as his own target.)
