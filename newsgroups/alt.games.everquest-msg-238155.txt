heh, you still are

let me play too!

"mage spectrals"

let's break it down--

mage: spells that pertain to the magician class

spectrals: spells that are level 63 or 64

hence, "mage spectrals" means "spells for mages taht are 63/64" in a
shorthand way which is understood commonly, though not universally ( because
you seemed to understand that he had spectrals that were intended to be
turned in to the mage guild )

to further clarify, lest any backlash follow, he was saying he can't get rid
of the 63/64 mage spells, but beastlord 63/64 spells (yes, called
'spectrals' or 'specs') are easier to sell

and finally, not to become antagonistic, but you have "heard of the spells
themselves refered to as Spectral's" .... and 'spectrals' is preferred over
'scrolls' because it is more specific
