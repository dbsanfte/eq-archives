Isn't it 12-72 hours?  A bitch of a camp.  Then again, on Zeb getting a
Naggy raid put together is a pain in the ass unless you're in an uberguild
who allow 46-52 twink alts, so I agree with our policy that they deserve
Ragefire if they're dedicated enough ("stupid enough?"  whatever :) ) to
camp him for up to 3 days.

Royally sucks to do Naggy at the moment in hopes of Ragefire right now,
that's the truth!  But if you can organize a Naggy raid quickly that's still
some decent loot and a SHOT at Ragefire, if they leave the server up for
even 12 hours.
