: This is a question for the very old-timers.

: I started playing during the Velious years, specifically August of '01,
back
: when the Tizmack armour was some of the coolest looking stuff in the world
: (still better, yo).  Even between then and now, the game is completely
: different... the removal of hell levels, the attrition of high-campage
zones
: like LoIO, East Commons becoming a ghost town, and the removal of the XP
: penalty for hybrids.
:
: What I'm curious about is how things have changed from the very beginning.
: I know that the hybrid XP penalty was applied to the entire group, at one
: point in time, and I've heard that bard songs affected everything in the
: area (heal healed the mob too, slow slowed the group along with the mob).
: What else has change significantly?
:

Boats are no longer necessary.
Walking more than 4 zones is no longer necessary.
Light sources for nightblind races is no longer necessary.
It took forever to level from 1-10 (okay, several hours of play time), not 1
to 2 hours, like now.
You could actually sell banded armor for a profit.
You could actually sell fine steel, for a profit.
You had to ride the boat.
You had to walk.
You could actuall sell silk and cured silk armor, for a profit.
Langseax was uber (almost).
You could sell Mino axes for 4 to 10 pp each, and that was good money.
Permafrost raids were the raids that proved you had made it.
The idea of soloing Cazel was a joke.
Spectres were scary.
Having a FBSS proved you were an uber warrior.
Boats have become superfluous.
Walking is not necessary.
Having a CoS proved you were an uber Necro (ok, I still have 2 on difft
chars).
The best mana regen was C2 (unless you're a necro).

What else have I missed?  Did I mention walking and boats?
