    Condescension aside here...

    I don't agree. EQ1 was (and for the moment still is) perhaps the most
successful business model in the history of computer gaming, not least
because it has the ability to be an ongoing project. A few hundred thousand
fans were willing to keep buying expansions and keep paying a monthly fee to
play. I think you're relying on an antiquated capitalist principle where it
doesn't apply - and that Sony have made the same mistake.

    MMORPGs have as much in common with other regular-pay services such as
net access and pay TV, as they do with conventional computer games. Regular
services with recurring payments depend on a quality of ongoing service, and
a continual influx of new subscribers resulting from a continuous marketing
effort - very different to a conventional computer game, with little or no
ongoing service or marketing once development and release has been
completed. MMORPGs have massive potential product life cycles owed to the
churning nature of their customer base and the evolutionary core (pure
software) of their product. Five years is a fraction of this potential -
quite close to a traditional computer-game development cycle really.

    They are now proceeding to destroy one income stream in the hopes of
establishing another, presumably bigger one. If it works it will only be
because they have thrown immense resources at it. If they had put forward
the same development and marketing resources into their existing product,
they could have made similar gains - and suffered none of the losses that
are now inevitable, as EQ1 players who have just watched their game's
death-warrant signed walk away.

    Everquest has changed a great deal in its five year history, in all of
the areas where so-called more modern games might compete. It is about due
for some new character models and some new content concepts, but these would
have cost less to add than the complete from-scratch rebuild that EQ2
encompasses.

    EQ1 languished in a complete lack of marketing for too long. The game's
lifeblood - new players - few and far between, with no apparent spending on
Sony's part to bring more in, despite the EQ1 team's contraversial
improvements to the newbie-appeal factor.

    That model works for cars, movies, blenders and toasters. Is it really
appropriate for MMORPGs?

    Why are people leaving EQ1? Most of the complaints I hear are bugs, slow
development, poor CS, and a lack of new players resulting an in inevitably
shrinking playerbase. The people who are leaving are nevertheless reluctant
to do so - they are leaving characters and friendships behind, things that
you don't lose when you replace your old toaster. EQ isn't getting old, it's
evolving, and the complaints are that its doing so too slowly, without
sufficient quality control or marketing. These point to a lack of
reinvestment, not the product's age, as the problem.

    I'm very glad my planet as internet access too.

    I do think capitalism has critical flaws and will one day be replaced
with something close to the theoretical socialist democracy.

    But not before the average joe voter becomes a better selector than is
the law of the jungle.
