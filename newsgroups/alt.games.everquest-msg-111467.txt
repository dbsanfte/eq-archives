Yes and No. When (not *IF*) EQ shuts down you will be forced to leave
your toons behind. It is better to say the Verant "hopes" you will
play EQ2, EQ3, etc, etc (they are a business afterall), and they are
surely writing the game to appeal to the same people that are
currently addicted to EQ1 as well as interest new subscribers.

Verant currently has one of the largest perpetual online gaming
communities. They have a very good understanding of the community.
Everyday we see people bitch about Verant in this newsgroup, yet most
of them play EQ as much or more than the happy customers. Verant's
greatest accomplishment to date is NOT catering to the whiners and
crybabies that are the vocal minority throwing tantrums on internet
message boards and newsgroups.

What you fail to grasp is that people play EQ for different reasons.
The person you are flaming takes a different approach and point of
view than you. Perhaps you should "just your mind" before you "spew
the standard reply of a clueless flamer"
