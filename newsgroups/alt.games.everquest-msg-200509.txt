Thanks.  :)

I agree, bit since you made the original claim, the burden of

I also learned to play when it was harder and when I try alts
I don't find 1-10 trivial.  Easier yes.  But not trivial.  It
still takes an annoyingly long amount of time to get into the
levels where you can actually experience the uniqueness of the
class.

Of course I should mention this is the opinion of a casual
player.  Many people here probably have no problem devoting
an entire Saturday to leveling an alt from 1-10.  For me it'd
take several days worth of shorter duration sessions to
finally level an alt to the point where I can experience what
the class is really like.

: You have ZERO risk when you die now up to level 10.  Not limited risk, ZERO 
: risk.

That is correct, and I would probably tighten things up a bit
myself.  Yes, I would make it harder.  I'm not arguing against
1-10 being too easy, I'm really arguing against the use of the
word "trivial" to describe it.  If you take a totally green
newbie and watch them play 1-10 they'll hardly describe the
process as trivial.

: Personally, I think that the new method puts new players at a disadvantage

I would make new players retrieve their corpse possessions at
an earlier level so their first corpse run isn't quite so scary.
I don't think the lack of exp loss changes matter.  The exp loss
on death prior to 10 was so minimal that it didn't matter
anyway, and avoiding the de-leveling of new players isn't a bad
thing imho.  I'd probably require a bit more exp to level and
increase the chances of skill raises.

I would also automatically warn new players about lagging skills.
For example if a warrior hits level 5 and still has <= 10 skill
points in a weapon skill, I would pop up a dialog that says,
"You feel like you should improve your 1 HB skill" or something
like that.

We agree on more than you realize.  I just think describing 1-10
as trivial is exaggerated.  Using the term "too easy" is better.
