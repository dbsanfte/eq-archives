That's not true. The necro and enchanter lines leapfrog eachother 
through to the midlevels.

darkpact (4) < breeze (16) < allure of death (20) < clarity (29) < call 
of bones (34) (and thereafter stays in favour of the necro, as he gets 
lich before the enc gets c2)

For two stretches enc buffs are superior: 16-19 & 29-33 worth a total of 
9 out of 34 levels. 

And that's if you only get your enc buffs from an identical level enc if 
the enc is higher level -- well you can run to pok for c1 which is 
superior to necro regen from 1-33. And c3 can land on him from 46-48, to 
greater effect than call of bones, while the necro still doesn't have 
lich. 

So technically the necro only has the best regen buffs that can be cast 
on him from 34-45 in the first 49 levels. After 49 its all necro... 
(afaik)
