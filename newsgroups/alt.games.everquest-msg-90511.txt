It does appear to be a problem with your Velious install.  It appears that
the game does not recognize that you have the Velious *chr.s3d files.  If
you don't mind reinstalling, I suggest doing so after backing up your
character files and eqclient.ini except first isntalling original EQ, then
Velious, then Luclin.  It's very unlikely that this is related to your
registration of Velious as registering does not affect the files on your
computer.
