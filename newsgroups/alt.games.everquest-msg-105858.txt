as far as I know, all the free sites do NOT have the price and drop info
that allakazaam's has. 
ditto for eqmaps....
eqatlas is the cheapest equivalent for maps , still free right now, but
their update time is just a tad slower than the pay site.
not bein stingy here, just tellin the truth.
i don't profit from keeping site info from others ;pp
(i wish i did haha)
