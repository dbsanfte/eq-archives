From the shadows, the mysterious "James Grahame"
<jamesgrahamenospammela@shaw.ca> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

That's not what I'm talking about. That more or less just continues to
show newness = popularity. But looking at the regular players, those
who were already on the win list, they just aren't doing it nearly as
much anymore. They're bored. The pace of the winning has dropped off
significantly.
