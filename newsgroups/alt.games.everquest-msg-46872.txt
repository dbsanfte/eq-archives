Not pointless, but interesting.

High elf Enchanter with everything possible pumped into Charisma. Gave
her the twink money and had her bank it. Then ran to Thurgadin. Bought
a ton of Coldain weapons at an average of 55pp each. Banked them all
and death ported back to Gfay. Went to the Kelethin bank and auctioned


"Coldain Velium weapons. Procs at level 1. Great twink gear, 100pp
each."

I made a bundle. Planning on repeating that performance and heading to
Rivervale and Qeynos. 45pp per item profit, I sold, IIRC, 11 of them.
