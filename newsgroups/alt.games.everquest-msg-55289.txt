Speaking of Pyzjn's spawn time (topic drift, look out), what is it? I've
heard all of the following:

 Pop the placeholder that comes up and stops in the ruins at 5pm and in
 11 mins or so she has a chance to spawn.

 Random pop no matter what you do.

 Run around the ruins, laugh at the moon, do the hokey-pokie and turn 
 yourself about, that's what it's all about!

Ok - so besides hokey-pokie, what is her spawn time? Is she on a straight
clock like Dylan in HHP is? Or what? I just made a concerted effort to get
my druid to 20 for the sole purpose of tracking this wench down and I want
that GBS. ;-) It'll go very nicely with my enchanters Stein of Magoo. (I
like that name better)
