True. Its wahy I always come back to EQ. But level 11 to 60 have ample
opportunity to find new challenges.

not so much a have have not. More well its always been done this way. so
every one should stare at a book.

For true newbies it is much harder to start than it was when all of us were
noobs. Sheesh that coming from an eternal noob like myself. But when 10 or
20 players are all new and discovering the game its one thing. For a noob
that starts makes a lowbie friend. Logs on sees that friend level 15 then 25
then 35, it's harder. Then goes exploring. Gets lost. Doesn't know about
bards necroes chipped bone rods and cannot afford them. Loses everything in
a corpse rot. Says Phhhfft. Logs off
Uninstalls game.

I just don't see this as a dumbing down. I see it as a removal of old stupid
game play mechanics that should have been fixed years ago. /shrug
