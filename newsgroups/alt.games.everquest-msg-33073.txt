    If you use a No Drop item, you can spam-click the entire area you're
searching. You'll get a lot of "This item cannot be dropped, traded, or
sold" messages, and whenever you pass over a mob (like the spawn point for
the KDS/Dwarf), you'll see the "You are too far away from X to trade."
Conveniently, the vial you need to give the dwarf is a No Drop item.

    Unless the intent of the quest was that I run around blindly until
something happens, this is the ONLY way to pinpoint the exact location of a
spawn point without having along a horde of pet owners. If the fact that I
know which spawn will occur bothers Verant, change the text message for the
dwarf to "You have stumbled...." and the two spawns will have the same
name - "You have" - when I click on them.
