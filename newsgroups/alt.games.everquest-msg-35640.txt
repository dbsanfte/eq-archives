It is an illusion I notice too. If 4 INT and +25 mana means you get off 5
nukes instead of [4 with 35 mana change] it -seems- like twice because:
=> You *seem* lose ~1/2 as often
=> Twice as many monsters it *seems* you can kill.
=> *Seems* lik you zone or run to guards ~1/2 as often
=> It *seems* like you are leveling twice as fast
