I hate driving my standard in rush hour traffic. 1st gear is designed to 
get me into 2nd as quickly as possible... not drive (did I say drive, i

Gas hit CAD$1.09 per litre here this week.

US$2.12 a gallon??... /homer drooling face

I'm seriously considering picking up a hybrid of somesort for my 2nd 
vehicle/wifes vehicle to help offset the price of gas in 'my car'.
