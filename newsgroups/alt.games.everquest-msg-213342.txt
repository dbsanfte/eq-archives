What about your hp per point of stamina ratio?

WEll good...Foxeye will have *something* to feel good about when the bard
is swarm kiting an AA every two minutes. :P

Thanks again Llyric. :)  The important thing is that it isn't completely
impossible.  I won't be wanting to duo all the time this time around (in
fact, if I'm in a duoing mood, I have Rak/Fox), but I'd like to know what
to expect when we do intend to take something on with just those two.  
One thing a bard/cleric is bound to be *far* better at than a
ranger/shaman is pulling singles in a dungeon, and there will be days when
our adventures require that capacity.  Many is the evening I've pined for
indoor-harmony....

Ooh, bards can get that gate-hammer too, can't they?!
