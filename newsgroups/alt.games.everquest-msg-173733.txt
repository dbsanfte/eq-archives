Bush Sr. was an "oil man," just like his son.  Notice, that he didn't move
in and take Iraq when he could have, and when there was alot of support for
doing so.  He listened to Colin Powell, and chose to try not to destabilize
the region.  That doesn't signal the greed that supposedly motivated him.
Think of how easy it would have been to have U.S. oil companies take over
the oil fields and reap the profits.

IIRC, additionaly, that Dubya has sold his interest in "big oil," unlike
Gore, who sold much of the U.S. military reserve supply to Occidental
Petrolium, which he was involved in, at a severe discount.

North Korea's nuclear revelation is also fairly new.  It would be
irresponsible to try to resolve the issue through diplomatic channels.  Iraq
has exhausted theirs, and still has not backed down.  Those who complain
about Iraq and try to beat the drums for North Korea are treating two
different issues like they're exactly the same.  Not a sign of good
judgment.
