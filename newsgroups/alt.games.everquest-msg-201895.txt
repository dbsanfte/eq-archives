 Well they do say 'partial' revamps so they will probably not change
much. If they just focuse on xp, density and loot those dungeons should
still retain their present flavor without being quite a pain in the ass.

 The Deep - The invisible bridge is lame. And mob density in some places
could use some work. Maybe a zone out farther in. I really like the
Plane of Tactics design how it has more than one zone out spot.

 Charasis - I personally don't see anything wrong with the zone as it is
now. They only thing I would change is maybe add a zone out down below.
Having wing keys drop on wing bosses I don't like due to the fact that
sometimes it can take hours for a named to pop. That really discourages
'crawling' through the place. Make the key a ground spawn or make it
always drop from the named or placeholder.

 Droga/Nurga - One way design (for the most part). Get rid of it. I'd
say almost everything else was fine although the loot was mostly
non-existant. Those who are working on Chardok faction may want to put
in more work before this goes live. 

 DN - Hmm. It works as a raid zone but for XP it sucks. It's really fun
having a spider port you into a trap. 10 little spiders can make quick
work out of a XP group. Gating mobs that summon... Get rid of those,
too. Density in some places could use a little reduction. I haven't been
there since 60 but some rats were unmezzable. If that's still the case
at 65 get rid of those too. For a raid it's no big deal but for an
average XP group it's dumb. Hell, get rid of them even if it is the case
65s wont go there to XP.

 Sirens Grotto - My god... What's to say about this zone. Since at least
half of it is underwater I'm not sure there's any hope into making this
a place people actually want to go. Heck just getting down the well is
fun. That pull sucks so bad. 

 The Hole - Get rid of the one-way drop and you're done with that zone
revamp. Perhaps add another zoneout in the city or something so the
zonein doesnt get trained all the time. Other than maybe the revs area
(Shammy/Enc epic area) there's not much that needs to be fixed here. 

 City of Mist - Get rid of the locked door to the castle. Or at least
add a key somewhere. The whole reason they added locked doors in Kunark
is because Rogues weren't really wanted in groups so this was a way to
force people to group rogues. Well... Rogues don't have this problem
anymore. Remove the forced-addition of rogues.

 Seriously, look at all the Kunark dungeons that require a rogue:
Charsis (since waiting for the key mobs is tedious and bad design),
Chardok (Royals), VP (Some dragons behind locked doors), Sebilis
(Crypt), Karnors (Only required to get out of Venrils area so not that
big of a deal), City of Mist (Castle/Reavers). Hmm think that's all.
Only ones missing that I can think of are Dalnirs, Nurga and Droga.

 The ghosting mobs in CoM need to be fixed as well. 

 Cazic-Thule - I'd say fix mob density in a few places, mostly
pyramid/4-corners/whatever they call it on your server could use a
little tweaking. Slowing the mobs run speed would be nice. Those things
run way too fast. Although I suppose it prevents a majority of trains
from making it to zone.

 Velks - Not much needs to change here. The pit is dumb design since you
can't get out. Or can you? I just know I fell down once and there didn't
seem any way out. The ice ramps up top, while fitting in with the
environment, are also annoying in the same way the invisible bridge in
The Deep is.
