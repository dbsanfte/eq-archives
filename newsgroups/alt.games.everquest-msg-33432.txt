Thanks Drake and all the others,

I finally did the most risky thing. During EQ Rush Hour (2000+ players) I chose
a not too secluded spot in Greater Faydark/Kelethin and did the magic thing.

How lucky I was to find the Platinum on the floor. The lag between camping and
starting may be like 20 seconds, so I took the risk.

Sorry to all the trustworthy colleagues whom I did not trust the money too.
Maybe next time. But first I got to earn so off I go with the Belts, Bones and
Bees.

Bye
Carlo
