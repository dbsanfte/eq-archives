More correctly, the left hand of the two piers on the right hand side.
The far left pier has a bunch of shuttles. Those will take you to the
totally wrong contient. (Kunark)

Unless they moved them very recently, this is a rumor that started in
another thread. The shadowed men are far off the path and won't bother
you on it. At lowbie levels, however, WC is far from safe with a lot of
wandering stuff that will gank you in a new york minute. Con everything
and be wary.

You know, I keep hearing this, and over the course of five characters,
almost all of whom spent a good portion of their lowbie levels in the
commons, I've yet to see a single freaking werewolf in WC. /shrug.

Ummm.... I'm starting to think your characters aren't at that level
either. The stuff walking around Kith at night will toast characters in
their 30's in no time flat. At level 32 I went in an hour too early in a
rush to get to Highkeep. (seven a.m.)  Probably less than 100 yards
along the path once you get out of the entry valley, I ran into a couple
of jokers who turned my 32 Troll Warrior into a smoking pile of ashes. I
didn't even make it close to the zone line.
