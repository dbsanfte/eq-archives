Gee, only 100PP? I should have that in another 10 levels or so ;)  (Okay 
okay it's SLOWLY getting better - at least now the dervs are dropping 
weapons worth a couple plat now - of course they're now green and barely-
blue for the most part, so the exp sucks, so I moved onto Oasis, and now 
I'm back to earning... meat :) )

A friend of mine just gave me a tour through there last night.  He was 
trying to teach me the way from the normal Guk to undead Guk, and he 
pointed out the spiders and what a pretty little mess it could be.  They 
look and sound disgusting, especially to someone afraid of spiders IRL :)  
Oh and - I HATE HATE HATE dungeons. (How the heck does anybody keep track 
of the twists and turns?)
