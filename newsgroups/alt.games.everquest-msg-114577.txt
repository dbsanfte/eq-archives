	Halfling Rangers make less sense than High Elf Shaman.

	And the last thing we wanted as a class was a new racial selection that
not only has obscene stats, but gets an experience BONUS.  We don't need whiny
little twinks running around, didn't need to see people PLing their peck
Rangers to 60 in days, and frankly are more than a little peeved about having
had to work through nearly 50 levels (in my case) with a 40% PENALTY, only to
see someone else get such a free ride.
