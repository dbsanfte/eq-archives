    A fair answer, to be sure, but not the 
one that I would give.  Ethan sounds pretty
content with EQ, and in fact says that he 
doesn't want to switch.  My advice is to not
switch then, or even try it out.  Why spend 
the money when you're already happy with the
game you've got?  It's not like there's suddenly
as shortage of people on EQ to make friends with.
Now, if you're starting to get burned out on 
EQ, then a trial run to DAoC makes sense to me.
