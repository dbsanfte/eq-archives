Othmir Prexus Totem
5 ac 20 sta 18 wis -8 cha

Eh. forgot about the 20 sta on it, that's about 39-42 hp, so I guess it's a
bit better than I thought, but the 18 wisdom is nearly pointless to me (I
have 220 with only 3 in range, 235 once I get epic, I don't care about +wis
items at all, I'm going for +hp/ac/mana/saves/wis, in that order,  elysian
legs and bp are the own)

Shield of Bane Warding
25 ac 20 wis 8 cha 12 sv magic

Not enough MR increase to be worth the price compared to a Sarnak Battle
Shield, no +HP (or even sta), not as much ac (or hp) as the much cheaper
OoIV (10k OoIV, always one for sale; 20-25k SoBW, rarely one for sale), no
+hp, and no +mana.  Oh, and I personally think the cat shield graphic looks
like poo (yeah, I know, the graphic of the OoIV isn't much better, but the
stats are).

The way I look at focusing on +hp/ac is that more hp keep me from dying,
which helps me level faster, which means I make 60 faster, at which point
I've got a friend that can likely get me into the #2 guild on my server (Can
kill everything but Emp/VT and Seru, but even the #1 guild ignores Seru due
to timesink BS).  And I like to scare people by tanking things, with
aego/focus I break 3k hp and somewhere around 960-980 ac.  Currently trying
to hit 900 ac/ 2k hp self buffed, I'll make the ac part once I get 56 and
get 6 more from swapping Thorncoat out for Bladecoat (currently 896 ac self
buffed), but I'm looking for a +hp item or two still, or waiting for 57
Natureskin for the last 80-90 hp boost. Although I guess that once I
actually hit 57 or 58 I'll hit 2khp with SLN (or at least be very close)
also, I break 2100 hp with PotC instead of SLN currently.

Druid AC softcap is around 1050-1100 from all that I've heard (compared to
warrior softcap at 1250-1350, up for debate on which of those it is, but
usually with 1250 or more unbuffed that's over 1350 with raid buffs making
it kind of a moot point), with major effects noticed at breaking 900 and 1k.
I'll have to look up some numbers on the DG later to check though, I know
there's a noticeable effect at breaking 900 though, since I bounce through
it when I get buffed in a group by a shaman or cleric.
