There was a bug at one point which prevented faction mods to other 
factions when you'd maxxed or minned your faction with one of the 
factions on a turn in. This has been fixed.

As far as Iksars, we have a documented example of a dwarf paladin (could 
it be any worse than that??) who was able to max his faction with 2000 
positive hits, who achieved the status of indifferent.

I beleive there are likely some 'hidden' factions (which can't be raised 
or lowered at all so we never see any messages about them, that some 
classes will start at KOS to.

I would also not be too surprised if there are factions which given 
race, religion, class(?) penalties can never be brought above KOS... but 
I have yet to see clear evidence of that.

We are also aware of some 'hard coded' hacks involving merchant npcs, 
and the animal one for rangers/druids... etc.

Finally, Faned is asserting there are factions which may allow for more 
than 2000 divergence, by or as he put it 'they don't start at 0', so the 
character is created as if he'd already done -1000 faction hits, 
(separate from the race/religion/class(?) penalties.  This would mean 
that the character can go -1000/+3000 from his starting point, instead 
of +/-2000. The range is the same but indead of a new character starting 
at 0 he starts with a number initialized here.

I suppose SOE could have done this, to further penalize some 
race/god/class(?) combos... but I haven't seen adequate proof of it yet.

Testing it would unbearably tedious. We'd have to create two identical 
characters and then maxKOS one of them with the suspect faction, and 
then perform positive factions with both and count them.

If the theory holds the max-negative guy will faction 4000 times to max 
positive, and the control will faction (e.g.) 3000 times to max positive 
faction. This would validate the size of the range (4000), and prove 
conclusively that the starting point was not at zero.
