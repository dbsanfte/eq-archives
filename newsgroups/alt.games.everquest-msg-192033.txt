Lot of people prefer to group with their solo capable characters.

Mages, Wizards and Necros have a particularly hard time grouping in the
higher end game because the formative levels of everyone gave no experience
of these classes. This is because they have soloed their way up the levels
leaving all groups to be formed without these three classes so when they LFG
people generally pick what they know.

There is a dearth of good lvl 60+ mages for high end guilds because a lot
quit out of frustration.

You have an option to solo effectively whilst LFG. Continue to exp while LFG
and you get best of both world.
