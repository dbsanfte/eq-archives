Most likely to sell in a MQ.  Last night on Fennin, as I ran my bard twink
to Guk, there were 7 druids aove level 50 in S Ro.  Judging by the unlooted
mob corpses all over the desert, they were't there to pharm silks (yay, more
silks for me).  I jokingly /ooc "Wow, lookie all the high level dr00ds in S
Ro, I wonder what they're here for?"  Aside from a few lol's no one had
anything to say, but most of the druids immediately went anon.
