Bearing in mind the rarity of Mammoths, and the point of this thread is how
often you get KSed when kiting, Fear Kiting isn't really a good idea... I
like to have more control over WHERE my critter is walking. That said, it's
less risky than sitting to med in the wide open and getting lawn-trash,
green adds because I either forgot to 'hide' or it didn't work :o)

Quadding's a skill that's hard to learn to do WELL (I still can't do it
properly at 43... hoping lvl 44 spells will improve my chances)
