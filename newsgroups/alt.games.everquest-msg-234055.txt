I recently started back into Everquest.  After a 8 month lay off I created a
new character on Stromm.  A Frog Shaman.  I played a Warrior for over two
years on one of the older servers and became envious of just how cool the
Shaman class is to play.  After two nights of playing I have reached level 9
and have my Tainted Breath DOT and SOW.  I have started to solo RED mammoth
calves in Everfrost with little difficulty.  I know Shamans eventually get a
pet but I was wondering what a good strategy would be to get into my 50s the
quickest.  Many of the strategy guides I have read are outdated with
pre-luclin info.  Also, is it safe to say that a Shaman basically starts out
like a melee and eventually develops into a caster, meaning, at low levels
you buff yourself, DOT the mob and then melee it until dead while at higher
levels your pet does the meleeing and you nuke it like a Mage would?
