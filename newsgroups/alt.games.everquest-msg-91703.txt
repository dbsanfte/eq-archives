Visually confirmed him killing every guard at the cabilis entrance
(including the roamers) at the same time at least once. The only thing
that stopped him was that the guards would repop and rejoin the fight.

Those cabilis guards are pretty capable (being newbieguards). And he
sucks up punishment from all of them at once for a good twenty minutes
sometimes.

And this is a L30-35 NPC.
