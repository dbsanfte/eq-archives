Yeah yeah, clerics can solo. Soloing well is a completely different 
story.. Compare how much exp you can rake in per hour compared to say a 
necro, druid or shaman for example. Won't get any easier when you get 
past mid levels either. Clerics don't have much of a means to do damage 
without using mana which means you get a lot of downtime.

And yes I know, enchanters aren't the best solo class either but I was 
trying to give a short answer.

Enough of newsgrouping for now, time to leave work for the weekend.. :)
