It's an equiped item (usually Skill Mod items are held, but there's a few
that are worn... Dwarf only Sense Heading Belt is one such)

The Skill Mod is applied to your own skill... if your skill is 200 (and a
capped Tradeskill) a +5% mod lets you work at 210 Skill... this will reduce
your failure rate on items that trivial between 180-250+.

That depends... in the above example think of maybe an Enchanter with 250
skill in jewelry... he/she wants to try high-end Cultural Smithing items
(some of the 230-250+ trivial gear) but with Smithing capped at 200, then
it's worth the reduced number of failures.

If there's a big gap in the skill-up progression (such as the jump in
Tailoring from Wu's Armour(135) to Velious gear (mostly around 200) then it
may be worth your time with a skill mod item.

If you're only around skill 100 or below, then it'd be cheaper to raise your
skill another few points than to buy a tinkered skill-device.(especially
with a skill like Fletching... where you can reach 202 without ever having
to leave the Vendor... and you start making a profit on Ceramic Vaned arrows
from about skill 185 upwards)
