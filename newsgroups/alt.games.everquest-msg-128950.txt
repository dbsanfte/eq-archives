I'm pretty new to EQ, so I've ridden the ship from Buther Block to Firiona 
Vie only a few times. Each time I had ridden it I would be riding the 
shuttle to get on the ship and a second Maidens Voyage would sail up and 
inside of the first one. Then I'd get on the deck, it would say 
"Loading..." briefly thereafter, and I'd be loaded on the shoreline just 
outside of FV. That was fine yet still seemed a bit off.

Starting yesterday, however, the second ship would sail up and inside the 
first as I usually saw, but then both would sail away as the shuttles were 
piloting toward them. You'd finally get to where the ship was supposed to 
be but had no where to go (unless you like swimming). On one such occasion 
I got to where the shuttle stopped in the middle of the ocean and the two 
others riding it both jumped in. I thought they must know what they're 
doing so I did as well. Both of them disappeared though lol. One of the 
guys got on the boat and made it to FV, honestly I have no idea how 
because the ship was well gone before we arrived (would it have not left 
his screen at the same time?) The second guy I sent a tell and he 
explained that while I could not cast spells (or forage) while peacefully 
sitting I could indeed do both whilst frantically swimming for my life. So 
I then foraged up some fresh grapes and gated out of the ocean.

A friend of mine advised me to hop on the rudder of the ship if I could 
get to it before it sailed away. I levitated before going on the shuttles 
and then ran to the rudder and made it. The second ship sailed in and 
pushed me through the first ship (walls, floorboards, everything). I ended 
up on the bow of the ship as it was sailing away, then I magically 
appeared on deck. I then enjoyed the entire ride and made it to FV. A GM 
had also offered to help if this trick hadn't worked.

Do ships often break like this? They've been broken a couple days from 
what I gather from the other players. How do they break like this in the 
first place and how are the ships fixed eventually?
