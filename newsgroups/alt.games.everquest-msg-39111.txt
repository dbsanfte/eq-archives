When I bind in a wanderer-filled zone that has water, I bind
about 50 yards offshore...

Swim out a ways, then stop, wait until your forward motion has
come to a halt and you're slowly sinking, then fire your
Bind spell.

Sure, you'll respawn underwater, but it only takes a couple
seconds to swim back to the surface.  Then you can look over
at the shoreline and determine the best time/place to
come back to land.

WARNING:  Do not do this if you tend to die while AFK, or
you'll drown repeatedly.  But if you're always at the
keyboard, it's the best way to almost guarantee that
there won't be a wandering creature at your bind spot
when you respawn.  Unless, of course, you're in a zone
that has dangerous animals in the water itself, like
Erud's Crossing and its killer sharks.

But for most zones with oceans, the water is a lot 
safer than the land.  When I'm going to be afk, I
even swim offshore and meditate underwater, using
a Fishbone Earring to prevent drowning.
