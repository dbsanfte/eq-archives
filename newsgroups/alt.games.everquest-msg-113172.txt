I gotta tell you.....

I play a Human Cleric and have been having trouble grouping with people full
stop...usually because the second a cleric joins a duo most of the time both
of them will pull vast numbers of unconned stuff, get nailed (most of the
time me along with them) and then bitch because I went OoM trying to heal
them...nuke...stun...root..etc...
whole other story.

Back on topic..
I had the opportunity to work with a fine orc group in oasis last night ( X
roads), mixed classes...the main tank kept going link dead, so i have a very
real idea about 5 vs 6. Stuff math, etc...the reality was that with 6 my XP
moved very well, when Bugim (tank) went LD for up to 10 mins at a time, XP
slowed, tank came back...xp rocketed again. Same levelled orcs...similar
number..
