Profit.  Sony is very much into that whole "making tons of money"
scene.  They seem to be remarkably good at it.

Make no mistake about it, if EQ didn't make a profit for Sony, they
wouldlnt' waste their times with it.

Because they can make more money if they make you buy the software.
Besides, AOL can run very differently from EQ, AOL has massive volume
to keep them afloat, with very little content needed.

Meanwhile, EQ needs a constant flow of new content in order to both
retain the customers they have now, and attract new ones.  An
expansion a year costs a hell of a lot of money... Especially the huge
scale that EQ expansions usually take.  

>Or sell it at like 10 buck the way it's priced now.

That $10 box only includes the original EQ, not the two expansions.
Sony probably can't affoard to give away those massive expansions for
free.  It's very possible that Kunark cost as much to make as the
original EQ itself did... and from the looks of the new Luclin
expansion, they're probably gonna spend even more.

Maybe.  But they could only really affoard to do that with the old
world set.  Might be a good idea, but honestly,  it'd cost them a ton
of cash to set up servers to allow such massive broadband downloads.
It's far cheaper for them to just put it in the little $10 box and
ship 'em out to Best Buy.  And when you really think about it, $10 a
box is probably the nearest thing to free you can expect.

umm... Been playing videogames long?  They're all like this.
