Much of this gear is embarassing on a cleric of your level.
(don't take this wrong, most of the gear my cleric has is
embarassing for his level... clerics dont' really need to
concentrate on gear to get their jobs done)

Rather than a point by point list, though, I strongly suggest
you go in to the Bazaar and do a location by location
search for High Elf Cleric Mana gear.  Amass a list
of upgrade items and their prices, and figure out how to
get the best raise in mana, AC, HP, without sacrificing
wisdom.  As a dwarf cleric who didn't max out wisdom,
I need to pay more attention to that, but you shouldn't need more
than what you already have, keep in mind that every
point of wisdom over 200 is only around 5 mana, so that
a high +mana item may be a much better deal for you
than a relatively small boost in wisdom.

Spend your cash on as few items as you can, as quickly as
you can, and then go out and get to work, freshly upgraded
and ready to rumble.

Hmm, the Kunzar Cloak is probably your most embarassing
item.
