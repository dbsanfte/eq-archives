From your "main" menu on the right side of the default screen, click on
"Abilities". You will see six (?is it six or eight? I think six) ability
buttons. You should have already selected abilites for them, or if not, you
can do so now by right clicking on an unused slot. Once that's done, just use
them by the number (they are labeled with their numbers.) using the /doability
command.
