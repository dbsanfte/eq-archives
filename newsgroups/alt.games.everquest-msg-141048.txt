You can enable DMZ host to the computer playing and that will take care of
it (under the advanced tab).  There are a range of ports that you need to
open (used to be 3000-4000 but that changed) and you need to enable them on
the UDP (just doing TCP will not work.)

I can't recall what the new port numbers are though, but it's a much bigger
range now.
