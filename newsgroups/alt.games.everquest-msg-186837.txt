I had to look and see about the transfer of characters once again. You were
right about the Rulesets Arklier, I didn't look close enough.

I'm not starting again lol, ah well, off to better things.

I took about 5 months off after gettin my cleric Caett to 52 and many more
characters over two accounts to 35+  I've always prefered the dark team but
I believe I had started on the wrong server, always played PvP. Haven't
experienced a blue server yet lol. I didn't have issues about lights versus
darks, but then again I started about 3 years ago when that was the norm. I
suppose the "shock" of seeing this idea of PvP going towards a blue server
with possible PvP occurences rather than, insta-fight. You see a lightie you
try to kill em mentality. Tis my problem, I did rant shortly getting riled
up on VZ and should've not posted in anger lol.

Thanks for the info and possibilities I might put more thought into.

Mak
