focus effects of the same type do not stack.  however, you can have more
than one focus effect in effect when you cast a spell.

for instance, if you have two improved damage items, you won't see
double the improved damage.  but, if you have an improved damage item, a
spell haste item, and a mana preservation item, you'll see the effects
of all 3 when you cast a dd.

as an interesting side note: if you have more than one level of a focus
effect, you'll get the message from the lowest one that applies to the
spell.
