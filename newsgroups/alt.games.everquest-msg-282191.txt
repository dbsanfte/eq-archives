Part of them seems to be still broken.  It has one of my toon wearing
a mottled goblin meat on my shoulder.  Also it shows all of my
characters with stats at zero, hp at zero, etc but it did display the
correct level.  It seems to be fine today if I can get around the slow
loading and incomplete page, it does seems to be nice.  It did list
all of characters I have on all servers including a couple I forgot
about.

Item search seems a bit faster than Allakhazam but I doubt I will
switch anytime because EQPlayers doesn't list the detail like where
the item drops or quest, etc.  It did have items listed that are not
in Allakhazam's database like (for example) Feral Guardian Channeler

ps when I checked my level 70 toon, it shows the xp at "17% to level
71"  Why 71?  Is SOE planning to raise the cap soon or just lazy
coding?
