It seems plain as day that the game should reward you best for doing 
things that are fun. 

It currently rewards you best (as a 1-grouper) for doing things that are 
both tedious and easy. Why is there so much resistance to agreeing it 
should be changed??

/shrug

I assumed they were the same thing ;) difficult = fun in my books.

Eitherway, grinding tedious, easy, cookie cutter missions over and over 
should NOT be the most rewarding.

And that's a great attitude to have. And I go one further. I think a 
game is flawed if that's not also the most optimal path. When I play a 
shooter and can choose between fighting the boss by hiding in a safe 
corner of the screen not moving at all or madly dodging bolts in the 
center ... I beleive the game should proceed with upgrades, high scores, 
unlocked levels when I can dodge the bolts... not when I can find the 
easy safe corner exploit.
