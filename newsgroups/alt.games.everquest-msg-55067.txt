I actually encountered what may actually -be- a bug.  My cleric died in EK 
during the event yesterday and I was looking for any rez - I din't care 
about EXP.  After playing my warrior for a while, I did a /who cleric.  A 
guy named "mort" was in zone so I politely asked him if he would have time 
to rez me in the future, no exp needed, and I'm not in a hurry.  He said 
sure, so I dragged the corpse to the bridge.  Several times, I did a 
"/who mort" and he would -never- show up in my list, yet, he was right 
there in the zone.

It may have been because there were so many people in the zone.  Either 
that, or "mort" is short for some other search parameter that I can't think 
of.
