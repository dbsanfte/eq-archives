Hmmm this would seem to make sense that these zones be connected.  There
are Dark Elves in Lesser Faydark, not to mention Castle mistmoore.  Also
if you read the books you can check out from the library in Paineel, it
sounds as though originally the Necromancers of Erudite stock,
worshipped Bertoxx not Cazic Thule as they do now.  I am searching for
information on why the ERudites became Cazic worshippers and gave up
following Bertoxx.  If anyone has any info on this please post it here. 
TIA
