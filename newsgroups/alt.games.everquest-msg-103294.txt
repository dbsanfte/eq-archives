Don't sweat it. You beat him 3 times with minimal force!! Your guild
should be proud!! 

The high-end game is all about dying sometimes. It happens, and I am
sure the members of your guild understand this. I bet you will all
look back on that night with pride and a few laughs once the initial
sting wears off. Plus you can mock any guild that sends in an
overwhelming force :-).

To ease the pain, get them together and go exp hunting. Find a zone
with mid-low level blues and go on a rampage. It won't take long to
get the lost exp back, and you won't have the stress of multiple
deaths.
