Under most situations, yes I would agree.  When /ooc Now casting 4 hour 
extended KEI turns out to be 2hrs 45mins???? There are not enough situations 
in the game to make a 1hr 15min difference.

15-30mins yes. more than that? No. Never. Don't, Won't, Not going to ever 
believe that.  Unfortunately, I have watched this game progress(or is it the 
opposite?) for the last 3 years.  I started playing about 3 months before 
Luclin was released, and loved the game ... until Luclin.  I grumped and 
groaned a lot, as I was beseiged by cats.  Then expansion, after expansion 
came at us faster than a smoking bullet, OODLES of content thrown down our 
throats .. some of it even good.  To the point, I have paid 50pp+ (MIN 50pp 
to any chanter for kei) several hundred times, and only a handful of times 
has it lasted anywhere near what was being /ooc'd.  This WILL give me a 
tool, to see who IS lying, and who HAS been in the past.  I am not the type 
to publicly blast someone for this in a public channel.  My shitlist WILL 
get bigger, I know it will.  As for playing with less chance to get a 
long-lasting KEI? I play a bst, necro, chanter, and druid ... all of which 
can pretty much go through the game without a KEI.

Well, that is my 2cents worth
