I've always felt the same way you just described but never really argued the 
point because, as you say, it's a matter of semantics. The free extra time 
that Verant gave after the EverQuest launch, that was "free". SOE tried to 
do something similar after the disastrous launch of SWG but they wound up 
giving a free day, lol. Thanks, I think.
