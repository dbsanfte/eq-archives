Dark Ages of Camelot allows you to pay for a horse that runs from city
to city. A nice way to get to a city and sight see without fear of CR
if you are a lowbie trying to join your other lowbie friends in
another city. WoW will have mass transit air ships.

I agree instantaneous porting has "shrunk" the world. But rather then
having to spend an hour getting from one city to another; I'd prefer a
mass transit option and I can live with a 10 to 15 minute travel time
and have it available for major cities where characters congregate. It
was always about getting together with friends which in the old days
could take up to an hour to accomplish.

Eur's Xing was perfect time length. The Butcher B run was just silly
waiting for the boat, then waiting for the trip. Just too long.
