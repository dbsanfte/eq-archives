I'm not sure I follow your argument... how is two weeks different from 
one week, or three weeks?

Now I'm sure I don't follow your argument. A case could be made that the 
PoP graveyards dumbed down the game, but what exactly are the gameplay 
implications of your body not disappearing forever, taking your gear 
with it, after a week? Could you at least give me one example of that 
making the game easier?

It seems like an awful lot of work to cater for the very few people who 
suddenly find themselves unable to log in for longer than a week at a 
time right after a death. Somehow, they don't strike me as such a vocal 
minority, compared to, say, mages or warriors, whose "whining" could be 
stopped with comparatively much less effort.

Certainly, and perhaps it's good that you won't have the worry of losing 
all your gear to add to them. Why so fucking callous all of a sudden?
