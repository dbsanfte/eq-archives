	The problem wasn't so much rifle accuracy not being greater than pistol at 
long range, but the penalties to rifle accuracy at close range.  In any case, 
at Sniping IV I don't miss often even at close range.

	It never did.  Once you hit the speed cap, all weapons fire at 1 shot/second. 
  The catch is that pistols hit that cap a lot sooner than rifles -- you need 
Master Rifleman, and maybe even Master Marksman to go with it.

	Rifles went to 11 because they fixed the non-working specials, and because 
the melee damage penalty was replaced by a to-hit penalty.  (IE, instead of 
taking 2.5 damage on every hit, you get hit for base damage, but more often.)

	Of course, all this is up in the air as they are redesigning the combat 
system from Ground Zero.
