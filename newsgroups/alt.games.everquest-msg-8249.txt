Fairly new on everquest and seeming learning the hard way :)

Have yet to do a quest and am wanting to.
@ my level and such,  does anyone have any suggestions?
Famillar w/  Qeynos and the Hills and (forgot name)
"glades" where all the big bears are.

should i be solo for my quests?

lost my paper required to give to guild. can i get another or how do i work
around that?

Any other suggestions would also be appreciated.

Thanks

    -kris.
