There is a bug right now that when singing a song that is a percussion song
or any other instrument based as long as you have that instruments skill
trained you will get a skill increase without the instrument in hand.
Because of this bug the only song you'll get singing increase from at 6th
level will be Lyssa's Locating Lyric.
