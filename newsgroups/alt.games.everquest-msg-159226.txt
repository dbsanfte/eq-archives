Not been on for a few days but I understand a new, somewhat heavily
nerfed version of Harmony is now available to purchase, still outdoors
only, now resistable but no aggro on resist, single target, higher
mana cost, lower recast time.

If my reading of the sp.dat is correct then it will be non aggro but
can be resisted.  Seems much the same spell now as the new nerfed
Harmony except it can be cast anywhere.  I wouldn't be the least bit
surprised if the beneficial flag was removed from both lines at some
point in the future.

The old Harmony works as before on mobs level 40 and below, I can see
a pattern here.
