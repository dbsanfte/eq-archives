No it doesn't.  "Fagot", however, does.  You might want to be careful how 
you spell that, should you try to walk that line.

> I am a grammar conservative.  I use all ready, not already or

Then you use it wrong.  "Already" doesn't come from "all ready".  It's the 
modernized version of the Middle English "al redy", and dates back to the 
14th century.  While it's true that the Middle English construction 
literally meant "all ready", Modern English doesn't have the analogous 
construction as a compound phrase.  What was that about bastardizing the 
English language?

That would be "commas".

You want a comma after "Americans".

You want to lose the comma after "X".

You know, for a grammar conservative, you're kind of a crappy writer.  
People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, you know?  As for "slang" 
and "lingo", of course they're acceptable in writing and speech.  Most 
languages have the concept of formal and informal usage.  The trick is to 
know when to use which.

all self-righteous about something while flagrantly messing it up 
themselves.)
