Snipped lots

Killing Gore is all down to a quick hard nuke kill.

We set up on South wall where there is a flat expanse.

Bard kites the dragon until she runs out of mana.

Meanwhile we are all waiting on south wall.

Pet classes cast there pets and set them up at the pull spot. MA waits there
also.

Gore is pulled in and pets engage. This gives MA time to gain aggro while
she is chewing on the pets (not long). MA calls attack, chanters sieve, all
casters including rangers that can cast fire based nuke just run up and let
rip. Whilst other melee attempt to get in. IF she not dead 20 seconds from
MA calling it you going bite the dust. Out of all the Kunark Dragons Gore is
by far the worst.

Resisting the roar and fear is more down to level, we find people level 58
and above stand more chance of resisting than below.

Of course we now have 3 MB wizards so a lot easier to do.

Gore is a frustrating experience.
