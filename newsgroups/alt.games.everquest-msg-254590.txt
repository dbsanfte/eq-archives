I'm not really familiar with the new tradeskill interface, the little 
tradeskilling I've done, I just set the thing to experiment, put the 
stuff in thats supposed to be there, and hit combine like in the old days.

BUT, I do have a thought; a handmade backpack requires a HQ bear pelt 
plus a backpack pattern.  If the automated recipies require that you 
actually have all the ingrediants on your person, then perhaps thats why 
its not showing up; you don't have the pattern.

West Commonlands is a good place, lots of bears.  Used to be Everfrost 
was the best place, because the cubs would sometimes drop them and there 
were always plenty of cubs, very easy to kill.  Now there are even more 
cubs, but I'm not at all sure they drop HQ pelts anymore, I went thru 
50+ cubs while getting newbie armor quest drops and didn't see a one.

The best place I ever saw drops for backpacks, though, was Shadeweaver's 
Thicket (which you can reach via the Shar Val book in POK); this is 
because an alternate recipee for the backpacks is to use a HQ rockhopper 
hide, and these dropped far more frequently off the various hoppers 
there than ever HQ bear hides did in the old world.  In fact, the vah 
shir beastlord newbie quest requires the use of (several?  At least one) 
HQ hopper hide, so I'm reasonably sure that the drop rate on these won't 
ever be lowered too far.
