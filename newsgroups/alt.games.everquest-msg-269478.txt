Hi guys!  Can anyone point me in the right direction to a good Text
Newsreader?  I have binaries covered with NewsBin Pro.  Newsleecher is good,
too.  But for a text reader I am using Outlook Express.  It does the job
better than NBP, which isn't meant to read text but, I was wondering  if
there are better that others who frequent text based groups prefer?

Thanks for any help.
