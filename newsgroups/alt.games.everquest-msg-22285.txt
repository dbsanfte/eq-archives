Folks, help me out with this one -- if you take all the
stream-of-consciousness insults and profanity out of
Bizbee's alleged rebuttal, is there anything substantive
left?

Did he actually rebut my evidence that he does, indeed,
flame when it's uncalled for?  Or did he just ironically
give another bushel of examples of how he all too often
goes into spittle-flying flame mode when he should be 
employing his higher brain functions to make an
actual point or support an argument?

Highlight's of Bizbee's, um, "rebuttal":
