Thank you! : )

I had actually never inteded on doing the quest...  a friend of mine harassed
me into it. : )   I'm really glad that he did now though, since I'm having a
great deal of fun playing with them, and seeing what they can, and will, do :)

I would be too.    Thats pretty incredible, under three groups, and pulling it
off flawlessly.  : )   We've done it with no deaths ourselves, but we almost
always have horrid overkill... very pro-epic guild.

I'm glad you got it.  Nice to see some of the nicer newsgroupies getting ahead
in the game as well as here. ; )

And my condolences to the ranger that made the raid official ; )
