Rehashing is right.  Thanks, we've already seen this argument.

And we're very impressed with your originality.  *pat pat*  Now explain 
that little threat.  I'd be interested in knowing how you plan on a) 
finding out WHO petitioned you and b) training them repeatedly without 
getting banned (under a new, spiffier name) - thus ridding us of a 
problem for good.

On second thought, better start training people's asses all over Norrath 
*now*.  Why wait for the report you know is coming, right?
