Is this server specific, an official policy, an unofficial policy?  I 
don't petition often, but in the few times I have petitioned, I did a 
/who all GM and saw nobody on, /petitioned, and was answered.  On at least 
one occasion even though the GM was standing in front of me, visable, he 
didn't show up on a /who all.  I know they can do this, and why they would 
do this, but I rarely see GMs visable to a /who all on Innoruuk at least.

Does anyone know which hours are *supposed* to be covered by guides?  If 
the guide program only schedules guides to work from noon until midnight, 
it would be good to know, because why wait three hours for a CS rez that 
isn't coming when a couple hundred PP and a bit of work will get you 96% 
of that.
