Just out of curiosity...

Do you get more satisfaction out of making items with your current
tradeskill levels (eq Ornate Chain or Cultural Leather), or leveling
up to the skill level required to make the items?

The reason I ask is that I worked very hard getting my Smithing skill
to 124 on the FV server. Untwinked and unfunded made it a chore for my
level 11 Shaman. I used the Metalbits-->Toolboxes-->Skewers-->Banded
method. Getting to a skill level of 124 wasn't what I would call fun
or entertaining. Luckily I was able to do it before the smithing
changes went into effect.

I am having a blast making banded armor for sale after the recent
smithing changes . (New trivials for banded top out at 115) So in my
case I am having much more fun making sellable items than grinding
through hundreds of combines just to get to there.

Even if Verant sold GrandMaster skills to players for a fee, they
could not just go out and flood the market with high end tradeskill
items. In the case of smithing alone, it takes thousands of PP and
hours/days collecting items in order to make a full imbued cultural
set of armor.
