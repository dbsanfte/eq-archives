ROFL...like when AC came out it "killed" eq...like when Diablo II "killed"
EQ?

They got...lessee....45 for the first one....15 for kunark....10 for
velious....240 (10/month for two years)...and the powergamers are demanding
change or they will leave?

Maybe one should start looking at game life cycle rather than at children
demanding how things should be done.

There was only one game that really changed via customers walking out, and
it was called UO. And EQ wounded it, never even killed it. UO went on to
change its ways to keep people and eventually focused more on the second
tier gaming market. Like all games must do.

You cannot let the patients run the asylum...
