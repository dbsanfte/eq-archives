If you would read what I said, you would see that I said the standard font
size at 1024x768 was quite readable, not that it was the standard
resolution.  The default resolution is still 640x480.  Can't say for the age
thing, don't need bifocals yet, but creeping up on it very fast, could be as
soon as my next eye exam.  As for color scheme, the only color I have
changed from the default is the guild chat which was completely unreadable
most of the time.
