If potentially having to replace hardware at some point is an acceptable 
risk, then I would agree. Some people will cut corners knowing that if the 
gamble (however small it may be) doesn't pay off, well, they can afford to 
replace it. However, with PSU's, you very often get what you pay for. 
Generic PSU's in commercial PC's will rarely reliably offer the output 
listed on the unit. Additionally, dirty power can lead to hardware failure 
or shortened life.

The *right* 450w PSU would likely be fine. I wouldn't want to run it too 
close to capacity on anything not from a reputable PSU manufacturer, 
though.
