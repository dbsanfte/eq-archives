I bought a Toshiba Satellite 5501-S607 with the same spec's. except
for the following:

P4M 1.7MHz
512MB DDR memory
GeForce4 Go Mobile 32MB DDR
40GB HDD 5400RPM

It plays EQ just fine on a wireless home network with *all* options
maxxed. I have only slightly more lag than my desktop, due mainly to
the wireless connection.

Other than that, my only complaint is that it gets *hot* underneath,
pushing all those textures and polygons around. :)
