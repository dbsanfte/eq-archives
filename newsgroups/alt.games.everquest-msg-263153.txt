I decided I didn't want my bardic title and went with Journeyman Potter.
(I have 220 or so in pottery).  I do like the idea of being able to choose
a "lower level" class title, though.  Some people, including me, don't like
the level 70 titles.  "Performer" for bard?  aye yi yi.

Incidentally, what gives the title "Keeper" ?  Is that alcohol tolerance?
