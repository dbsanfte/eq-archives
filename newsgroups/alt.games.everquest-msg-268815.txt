You can't bind, and when you die, you always respawn in the same zone.
You usually get a choice between a few different locations to respawn,
but I think you have to have been to them (or in that general area,
anyway) before the choice shows up on death.  I haven't experimented
with this, though, I tend to avoid dying. :)
