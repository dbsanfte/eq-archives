A really short take!

Pros:
Sound, music, graphics incredible. Just like the screenshots.

Battles fun, though shorter than EQ1 it feels like. 

NPC baddie animations, vocals, fighting superb.  Love the goblins yakking 
at you.

Interface very good, still trying to figure out how to change chat 
colors, etc. Complicated like SWG but easier to figure out. Very 
colorful.

Water amazing.

Kind of cons:

Didn't get that 'EQ' starting thrill, but that's okay. I don't think any 
game will do that again.

Freeport is -really- dingy, dirty, gray, dark, boring, yuk. Next 
character will be good/Qeynos definitely.  This isn't a con I guess.

Con system okay(though busy like shopping strip center signage) except I 
wish they would have left out the group aggro factor that you can see and 
count.  No more Unrest Uncertainty except for wanderers, hand-holding at 
it's worst. Safer yes, but would be first on my list of changes if 
possible. 

Class system,everyone is the same to 10(mages, etc), then kind of similar 
to 20, then finally different.  So it inherently makes you feel/want to 
powerlevel to 20 to have your own persona(character). 

No boat rides I think.  Ding dong bell silly.  3 minute ferry boat ride 
would have been far more realistic and fun.  Put vendors and banks on 
boats!

Character selection very very limited, no fat or thin ogres.  All 
development time spent making tiny facial changes that you'll never see. 

All in all good fun so far and worth the money.  I think once I get 
things organized more, and a clearer picture in my mind of some stuff, my 
next characters will be more fun to play.
