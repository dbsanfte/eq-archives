/boggle.

Someone was calling you rude for not grouping them, and you actually let
them join?

As far as I am concerned, there is no automatic right to join my groups, or
the groups I'm in.  Even guildmembers don't get the right to invite
themselves along.  (Not that there were many I would object to, just a few.)
But random fuckwit_01?  Having him demand a group from me on the basis of
"You have an open spot, wah!" would be grounds for instant and permanent
/ignore.  Often after a short lecture on what rudeness really is.
