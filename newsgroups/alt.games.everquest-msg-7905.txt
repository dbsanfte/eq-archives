One thing to keep in mind is that if you could start an account
with a free EQ download:

1.   You'd have hordes of people literally overloading the servers with
newbie characters, most of whom wouldn't continue to play the game.
Verant (and we players) don't need that kind of constant newbie
tidal wave.  With the current system, only folks who are serious
about playing (and who have "paid up front" for the system resources
their characters will take up) will come into the game.

2.  "Grief" players (people who play only to get their kicks trying
to annoy other players -- much like newsgroup trolls) would start
a new account every time their old one got canned if the startup
cost were free or minimal.  There'd be no slowing them down.
At least with a required "entry fee" each time, only the most psychotic
(or rich) grief players would keep at it after getting banned
once or twice.  And there would be few enough of those to keep the
problem in check.
