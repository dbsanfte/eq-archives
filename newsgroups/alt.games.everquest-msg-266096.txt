Not much need to rely on rumor. During testing there were times when there 
were 31 servers (named Beta1 through Beta31) in the queue available for 
testing new character creation, so we know that they have at least that 
capacity theoretically available. The plan will probably be to bring out the 
first dozen, fill 'em up, then roll out the next dozen (notice the list 
above lists twelve). The prerelease announcement on the beta board mentioned 
that there were "dozens" of servers ready.
