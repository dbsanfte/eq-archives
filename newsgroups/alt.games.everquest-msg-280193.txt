No, actually it doesn't.  It's a billing error, not a pricing error.
Yes, vendors are required to absorb pricing errors - doing
otherwise is illegal in various ways in most jurisdictions ("bait
and switch" tactics, etc.)   The doesn't mean they can't send
you an updated bill if they find an error.  Various utilities (water,
gas, electricity, etc) do this as business-as-usual - estimated
bills and corrected ones when meters are read.  Think you'd
have much luck convincing the electric company you don't
owe money because they underestimated the prior month?

They'll just terminate the account when the payment runs out, just like
any other time.   At that time you could either pay the money owed or
move on.
