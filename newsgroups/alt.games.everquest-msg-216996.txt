ya well. Win some lose some. I've been booted out of groups when someone
kei'd the group before...

I rarely haste in group when charming. To easy to wipe the whole group if I
let go of the dragon's tail (die due to charm break).

Charming isn't a science, it's an art form. Like any art form, there are
many that just don't have what it takes. For myself, well, I'm certainly no
Rembrandt.

I watched an enchanter, same level, worse gear, charm his way DEEP into a
tough tough zone. He never dies, never went oom, and I never had to help him
(this was by way of a demonstration). He got a pet he was really happy with,
dropped 2 proccing weapons on it, a muzzle, big haste, and went to town.
kept it about an hour.

I couldn't do that. But it was Most impressive.

I do enjoy being in a group with another enchanter. Last one (last major
time I played) I setup for buffs (had the extended enhancement) he setup for
CC, me with some 'backup', and we both charmed. They had stuck me in as the
'hmm he doesn't take anything away so let's take pity on him' 6th man. I
think we doubled their kill rate.
