So exactly  what right of SOEs conferred by copyright legislation are
you accusing Yatis et al. of violating?

What exactly is this 'incarnation' of plat your talking about? The
actual counter in the database that says how much plat I have?

SOE created the counter sure but putting plat into or out of it for
any reason doesn't violate copyright law.
....

On a tangent....

I could also argue that my character record (including my plat) is my
Intellectual property as much as theirs. Think about it this way...
they provided me a database entry and a set of pieces (the virtual
world)... I spent hours arranging and organizing those pieces to make
a character record look how I wanted it too... that makes it *my*
creative work.

If Everquest was an online drawing program, and they provided the
paper (blank record), and a series of "stamps", and I took those
stamps, and told EQ where to put them, and my efforts made a little
scene, that  scene would be my property. The stamps would be theirs...
but the scene: thats mine.

SOE provided the counter... but perhaps the number in that slot
belongs, in significant part, to me. I put it there.
