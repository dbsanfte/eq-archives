They can write a ticket for anything they want, but I don't think that
ticket would be upheld in any traffic court. There is no explicit minimum
speed limit, it's variable depending on what's safe. As a matter of fact,
the same is true of the maximum. California uses the notion of "safest
reasonable speed under current conditions, up to the posted maximum". If
it's not safe to drive over 25 because of some unusual road conditions
(debris, snow, whatever), you could get ticketed for 40 even in a posted 45
maximum speed limit zone.
