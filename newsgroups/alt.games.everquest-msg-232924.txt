No.

They work for all afaik.

For the cash strapped...

Swiftclaw sash is 15%, and can be obtained by any tracking class in 
their 20s with some time effort. I just parked my Bard there, and before 
  each session I logged the bard in, located and killed the spawns. I 
had the sash in around a week, after completing the quest 3 times. It 
was very painless. FBSS is 6% better, and worth getting, but for a 
couple hours work 15% haste is decent, and its droppable so you can 
always drop it on an alt when you upgrade.
