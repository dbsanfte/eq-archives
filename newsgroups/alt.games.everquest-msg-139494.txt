This thread was going else where as well but anyway, from the way it reads
druids will now get a Nexus port as Wizards already have one and both
classes these new zones but these ports are only available if you are on
Luclin, not from Norrath...so no new ports to the moon, just new ones on it.

Yes, about time. Travelling around the moon, especially Twilight Seas and
Grimling Forest is not a pleasent affair.
I'd rather there was a port to Maiden's than to Dawnshroud. DS peaks is a
simple enough, just run thru Neth. Lair but Maiden's Eye you have to brave
the ME/DP zone, that zone really needs the double zone point like Karnors
and DP/NL...the trains there are nasty and repetitive.
