I thought of that too, but I'm not sure how it helps if the mobs
really are stacked that tightly together.  You target something
and you have a mob at 100% hits with a target circle.  You cycle
the target and you still have a mob at 100% with a target circle.
How can you tell if it's the same one?

I guess if there's another mob in your line of sight (or whatever
passes for line of sight with the target button, since it often
manages to target something I haven't seen yet :-), you can cycle
the targets and see how often it shifts to the remote mob.  I.e.,
if your cycle looks like wisp-wisp-wisp-othermob01-wisp-wisp-wisp-
othermob01-etc., you know there's really three wisps in the stack.
