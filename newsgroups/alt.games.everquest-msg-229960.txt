I have solved the problem. Albeit maybe in a more complex fashion than
necessary, but this works for me.

Short version: problem lies in UI_character name_server.ini file in
the Everquest directory. The width and height of the skill window was
set to zero [0]. Editing to set the width = 300 and height = 240 fixes
the problem.


Long winded version:

My newly created characters (at least those created after the big
patch in December) had a similar problem - the skill list button in
the Inventory window did not bring up the skills list so I were unable
to check what their skill ratings were.

I had a friend create new characters, to see if the problem was
related specifically to my computer, and his new characters on two
different servers also had inoperative skill buttons.

One obvious workaround was to go to the character's guildmaster and
open up the training window, but that was hardly convenient.

My first effort to find out why new character's skill buttons didn't
work but older character skill buttons did (and still do) lead me to
look for INI files in the Everquest directory. The first I came across
(filename: character name_server.ini) contained info like friends,
ignore, etc. My search stalled for awhile since nothing in that ini
file seemed related to the skill list.

By chance, I found additional INI files (filename: UI_character
name_server.ini) and a search of a ini file with my new character's
name found the following:

[SkillsWindow]
XPos1280x1024=0
YPos1280x1024=0
Width1280x1024=0
Height1280x1024=0
BGTint.red=255
BGTint.green=255
BGTint.blue=255
BGType=1
Fades=true
Delay=2000
Duration=500
Alpha=255
FadeToAlpha=255
Locked=false

I compared that entry with a similar entry from a known working ini
file:

[SkillsWindow]
XPos640x480=120
YPos640x480=200
Width=300
Height=240
BGTint.red=255
BGTint.green=255
BGTint.blue=255
Fades=true
Delay=2000
Duration=1000
Alpha=193
FadeToAlpha=128
Locked=false
XPos1024x768=512
YPos1024x768=170
Width1024x768=300
Height1024x768=240
BGType=1
XPos1280x1024=440
YPos1280x1024=472
Width1280x1024=300
Height1280x1024=240

I am sure you can see what the problem is. For some reason, the width
and height of the skills list window was set to zero [0] width and
zero [0] height when the character was created.

Had I found the reason the skill button didn't seem to work? When a
working ini file was examined I found that the width should have been
300 [pixels] and the height should be 240 [pixels] in my case.

I didn't know if the solution was this simple so I confirmed this by
editing the new character UI ini file and changed the zero values to
the corresponding values from the known working file then started
Everquest and tried to bring up the Skills window which now worked.

Once you can get your cursor on the skills window, you can change its
position on the screen and resize it.

Be sure to use a ASCII editor, such as notepad, or be sure to save the
file as a text file.

Keep an original copy of the ini file just in case. It can always be
deleted later if things work properly.

I suppose that deleting UI_name_server.ini would force the game to
recreate it, hopefully the reinitialized ini file would have proper
values for the skill windows instead of zero, zero.
