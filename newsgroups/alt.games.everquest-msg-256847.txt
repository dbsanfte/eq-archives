But lets say an extra spell slot makes you 1/16th more effective... what 
does that do to the current balance between casters, hybrids, and pure 
melee?

I see the same situation with LOY; the casters all got an extra spell, 
often a very effective one, while the pure melee got nothing comparable. 
  There should be a discipline tome, no drop, quest in LOY, for 
rogue/warrior/monk, and one should have been added for berserkers.

I've heard the "easy quest for haste item" thing, but since 21% haste is 
available for around a Kpp on most servers, a comperable haste isn't the 
same thing as a new spell giving you power that nobody who doesn't have 
LOY can get.

What's the comperable thing they are putting in OOW for melee, that will 
float their boat while the rising tide floats that of mana users who get 
the extra spell slot?

I think L70 is the draw for me of OOW; I'm not a raider and I'm not 
going to get very deep into the "high end game" where progress currently 
lies at 65; being able to gain in power without having to commit to 
months of drudgery farming items for a guild in one zone in order to be 
able to move on to another zone where we can farm items for a guild? 
I'll take it.
