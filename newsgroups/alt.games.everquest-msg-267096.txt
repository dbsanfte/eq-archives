You can also search on any broker (generally there is a broker in each 
tradeskill instance entrance as well as a few scattered about the cities) 
for a player that is selling the books you need.

Now if only they'd get the fighter skills fixed so they CAN ACTUALLY BE 
MADE.  Grrrr.  WTF is up with not offering they key suspension components in 
any shape or form anywhere in the game?  Complained about this in beta (one 
form was there, one was missing).  The missing suspension was added less 
than a week before the beta ended, and now BOTH have completely disappeared 
from live.
