Thanks. I'm having a bit of a problem with the current configuration (it 
interrupts the booting process until I have confirmed that I want 
firewalling services started by hitting ^D), and it complains about the --p 
and --f options not being valid. I guess Mandrake does things a bit 
differently from RH, despite being based on it.

I guess it's down to me now to dive into the docs and figure it out... 
thanks a lot for your help so far. :)
