you have most of the important ones but you really should look into one 
of the packages that has the ones you are missing.  The newest expansion 
is mainly geared to higher level people but having the guild hall is 
good for all levels.  you can probably get a pack that includes all 
expansions except the last one for around 30 bucks.

LOL! my druid is stuck at 52 right now.  I don't play much because I let 
my hubby play most of the time.  Been 52 for about 4 months or so.

It's hard getting groups anywhere any level.  LDoN isn't as popular as 
it was when it first started but you'll occasionally see people trying 
to get together a group for one.

IMO, all the servers are candidates for mergers.  Check out the newbie 
zones, practically ghost towns.  I play mainly on Bertoxx.

I think the quiet is a function of all the new games people have gone 
off to play.  They'll be back, they always come crawling back to EQ.  
I'm guilty of that one, I can't seem to shake my Evercrack addiction.

Have fun
