Try typing in "killsteal" as one word.  Your spelling might be more
correct, but it seems alot of people type it as one word.  I found several
discussions of the topic that way.

  This might be an issue as well.  Most of the threads I have seen on
killstealing tend to end up in the general board.  Alot of bitching in
general ends up there, actually.

    Been on the boards since about two weeks after the launch.  I do
remember there being alot more discussions/complaints/near fist fights
about the subject in the first month or so after I started reading.  I
think this might be because most of the "killstealing" incidences occur in
the lower levels (below say, level 15), and naturally near the launch there
were many more people packed into the content geared for this level
range.   Unfortunately, Cryptic does regular wipes of their boards of any
thread that hasn't had a reply in the last two weeks, so I can't really
back this statement up.

   I hope I've answered this.  Please let me know if you would like me to
provide links.  Oh, and thanks for not answering my challenge with rabid
frothing of the mouth and so forth.  Very refreshing here in Usenetland.
