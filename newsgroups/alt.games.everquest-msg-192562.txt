Yah, i have read those sites, that is how i got this far.  But where
do i get the other parts? I mean do i just ask people randomly for
them? I can see that i need all of the ones the other classes make,
but what do i give them in return for their stuff?  For some reason
this is just confusing the heck out of me. *brain fart I guess*.
