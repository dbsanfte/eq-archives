I believe they hit agility because of scouts, not fighters.  With my
self-buffs, and my higher agility because of the power aspect, I could
tank a lot better than some tanks.  Duoing with a healer meant the
healer started doing DPS because I wouldn't get hit at all.  If I did
get hit (which was rare), it really hurt, but it didn't happen enough
to be concerned with.  There were posts about how well predators (at
least assassins) could tank prior to the fix on the offical boards.
That doesn't mean that nerf didn't really really hurt though :P

I'm not sure if I agree with that either.  The quests were prety lame
for a bit, some there are some great ones.  Heritages are a blast to do
(until you are stuck camping some stupid named mobs).  The high-end
quests (Fire and Ice, Deception) are just incredible, everything about
them just rocks.  The text and lore that go with it really pulled me
in, and that is saying something.  In Bloodlines, even though
everything was gray, I still felt a sense of adventure while running
around in the new area to see what it was all about.

I will admit I don't know anything about carpenter issues.  One of my
friends is a carpenter that just hit 40 earlier this week.  She isn't
the type to complain, so I guess it isn't surprising that I didn't hear
about them.  I can say she really enjoys making furniture (I can't wait
until I get a cedar archaic chair, that thing is awesome looking).
