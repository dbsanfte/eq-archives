Well, no.  The British COULD decide to declare war on us
and attack New York.  That doesn't justify us launching a
surprise attack on the British fleet.

And a lot doesn't -- including some of the basic rules invoving
war crimes and atrocity.

It was me.  My point here is that even were it a legitimate target,
it would not be a legitimate attack...

"Understandable" is one of those weasle-words for trying to 
justify the unjustifiable without having to take ownership
of that justification.  It is "understandable" why Stalin
killed millions of kulaks.  I can "understand"  why serial
rape-murderers commit their horrible crimes.

And I can "understand" why Israel committed the atrocity
she committed.  That makes it no less a war crime and
atrocity.

And a thus a war crime and atrocity.

And thus it is a war crime and atrocity. QED

I never claimed it was terrorism.  In fact, it explicitly
does not meet the definition I put forward.  I stated that
it was a horrible war crime and atrocity.

The fact that something is self-serving (and thus "logical" in
terms of self-interest) does not exclude it from being a
war crime or atrocity.

... and that does not constitute a defense against charges
of war crime or atrocity.  The mere fact that one can rationalize
something does not justify it.  It didn't work at Nurenburg.
It won't work here.

However, "understanding" why a criminal commits a crime
does not change the severity of the crime or culpability 
for the crime.

No, I am saying that the attack was a war crime and atrocity.
It is appropriate to concentrate on those aspects which constitute
a war crime and atrocity when making that point.

Are you suggesting that the Israelis warned the Liberty to

Nope.  You would be cashiered for being an idiot for attacking
a neutral country on its own territory.

One of the things they taught *me* as an officer was not to
rationalize stupid decisions and hide behind field expediency.
They also taught me that there *are* such things as illegal
orders and unethical orders.  They taught *me* that expediency
does *not* justify war crimes.
