Because I killfiled him a long time ago, and all this is is yet more 
noise to attribute indirectly to him?

It's a moot point, kind of, since I finally caved and followed Richard's 
example of KFing people from this newsgroup as well.  What the hell is 
wrong with everybody, anyway?  I've never seen a troll manage this much 
chaos.

Well, it contributes even MORE useless noise to the newsgroup.  If he's 
so interested in writing notes to ETP, let him track down the guy's e-
mail and vent there.
