Both posts of frustrated gamers that are not regular newsgroupers.

>"I keep getting error #### when I try to log on?"

Error? I haven't had one of these yet. <SR knocks wood>

>"Verant needs to refund money for ALL THIS DOWNTIME!!!!"

<SR has flashbacks of work and cable tv subscribers asking for a days
credit when their cable is down for 30 minutes>

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!..... Nevermind... I'm ok now.

>"Why can't they bring down the servers when no one is on?"

Yeah, like there is EVER a second when NO ONE is logged on.

>We actually take bets on when the first moron that posts about
>the servers being down on patch day.

Do you bet online money, or does the winner just become king of the
day around here?

>When the post comes it generates the requisite flames.

Just because you've all heard it SOOOO many times? Or because you
don't recall being a newb? Or some combination of both?

>So realize this is the environment your post jumped into.

Oh I know that *now* but doesn't do any good after having been jumped
on for the last couple of days.

And yeah, I know how it gets regarding some of this stuff. Hell,
posted in AGD for years. I kill filed threads that contained "cheat"
or "realm down" and similar because I just didn't have the time to
deal with screaming (they usually typed in all caps with an
overabundance of exclamation points) idiots whinging they couldn't get
online. Though I never heard people saying that Blizzard should
compensate them for the time they couldn't get online.

If I read decently asked questions about cheating or why realms are
down, I would take my time to explain. It's just the screaming idiots
that I couldn't take. Hence I posted in decent grammar in a hopes of
getting some sort of info. Perhaps there was a patch that I'd missed
hearing about. Or perhaps there was something somewhere someone had
read and they'd found out some seriously deranged EQ'er had gone nuts
and taken over Sony headquarters and was threatening to kill the top
guys if they didn't shut the servers down. Oh wait, damn, sorry,
haven't had my coffee this morning yet any my conspiracy theories are
running uncontrolled.

Anyway, nice seeing that some of you can flame and then be 'normal'
again. Sad that some can't. Such is the life of usenet.
