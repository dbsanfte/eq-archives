Ok, my little bard just hit 35.  Woohoo!  Track!!!  
Off we go to Shar Val (sp?) to charm (literally) the trainer and spend
our last 6 pts.

[5 minutes later]

WTF?

[pause for reflection]

Ok, I used to play a ranger a year or so ago.  Seems like I used to be
able to sort the tracking list a bit?  I understand that's not an
option for the bardic types.  Oh well, I can adjust.

BUT - I do have a question then:  Is the theory that the list is
sorted (top down) by proximity?  In other words, is the name at the
top of the track list the closest to me?
