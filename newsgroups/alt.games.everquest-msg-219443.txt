Shaman first, Cleric or Chanter second.  I think the slows combined
with healing of the Shaman should make him the clear leader.  As for
the Cleric or Chanter...the Cleric may be better equiped to handle the
reasonably high demand for healing that the Ranger will generate. 
However there are some fun things you can do with a Ranger/Chanter.

The Ranger can toss out a 14 minute snare before the Chanter charms
something.  You now have a reasonably "safe" pet.  Now you can snare
another, send in the pet, and the Ranger can melee until low on health
and then step back to heal before aiding the pet some more, constantly
watching the pet for a broken charm.  Your biggest problem here will
be the difficulty playing both parts if you are dual boxing.  However,
this combo becomes very exciting once your Ranger gets his archery
AA's, as he can play the charm pet support role, while your pet will
get to take care of all tank duties.  At this point you get all the
advantages of the Druid/Chanter combo with better DPS.  The Ranger's
poor mitigation doesnt matter, as he isn't getting hit.

> I guess I'm between a cleric, shaman, druid, or chanter? Maybe even a bard?

Bard, hmmmm, I don't really see him as nearly as advantageous as the
Shaman.  He may be fun to play and he brings much to the group, but
you are going to need heals, not healing over time.  You are going to
need real slows.  And all of the "fun" things I can think of that a
Ranger and Bard could do together really require (much more so than
the Chanter/Ranger combo) one person per account.

The Ranger is a great "solo" powerleveler, second (IMHO) only to the
Druid, at least through level 30 or so.

> to do this?

Damage shields.  Toss up the best damage shields on the Ranger and the
powerlevelee that you can.  Pull a train and park them on the Ranger. 
(Keep chloro up, as your health will slowly be chipped away.)  Make
the Ranger kneel.  If he is standing, he will riposte, often times for
enough damage to "ruin" that fight.  Now start pulling mobs off the
Ranger with your DoT's or DD's, one by one.  As long as you get one
hit in (or one DD/DoT in), the Damage shield will do the rest of the
work in short order.  Switch back to the Ranger and heal yourself.

This is safer and easier with someone actually playing the Ranger but
I dont see why it cant be done.  The Druid is a superior PLer because
his pre-level 51 buffs are superior to a Ranger's pre-level 51 (can't
cast 51+ spells on a powerlevelee).  The one advantage of the Ranger
is that you can park a train on him and not worry about him getting
hurt, at least not as much as compared to the Druid.  As for other
powerleveling classes, they do well in some areas.  But for all around
PLing at levels 1-30, the Druid/Ranger line of damage shields combined
with heals make them superior to Clerics or other popular PL classes.

Depends on your guild.  Many might take offense to such a request. 
Others would gladly do it.

All I can say for the Shaman is try to concentrate on cheap focus gear
for the first 20 or 30 levels rather than worrying too much about
wisdom.  You will get better deals on wisdom gear once you are high
enough level that the level restrictions dont matter as much.  Power
leveling gear is often expensive because it is mostly old-world stuff
that doesn't have any level restrictions.  It may well be crap
compared to new stuff though (except for the level restrictions),
making it worthwhile to just power through those first 30 levels or so
and then really start to worry about gear.
