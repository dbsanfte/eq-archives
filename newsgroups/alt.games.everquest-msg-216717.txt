in addition to what everyone else has said ("don't pay, the chars will still
be there"),

i can add that even DELETED characters can be restored (meaning they are
never deleted from the eq banks, but can be overwritten if someone starts a
char with the same name) after [probably] years

i had a deleted wizard (gone for about a year) that was restored a few
months ago

no one started a character named "zinfa" =)
