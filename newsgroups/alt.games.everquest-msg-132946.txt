I am annoyed at 5 NetCops, or 50, just as much as 1 NetCop.

My own advice?  All that is is to "not be a whining NetCop".  I'm not 
being a whiner NetCop.  But you are.  A simple equation.

AND YOU HAVE THE POWER TO NOT SEE OR ACCESS SAID GROUP.  YOU HAVE THE
POWER.  You are no different than some whining old lady gasbag who writes
to the FCC about radio or TV shows she finds "offensive".  SO CHANGE THE
