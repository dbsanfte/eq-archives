 I like onions so I probably wouldn't complain since I'm getting
something extra without paying extra. However, if I ordered a pizza with
onions and it came without them I would complain about paying extra for
less. Also if it came with something I didn't like I would complain just
on general principle.

 Not sure what that has to do with anything, but I have to chime in on
all pizza-related threads!
