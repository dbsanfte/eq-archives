There is a lot MORE to this game than platinum and
items. You can successfully play this game without
all those "uber" items.

I think by focusing on all this "money" and "items" you
are missing the key points of the game!

#1. Have fun! If you not? Don't play!

#2. Try roleplaying? People have shelled out tons of
      money and items to me for my roleplaying! I'm not
      saying that I'm great at it, I just had some ideas!

I went around Riverdale as a halfling and told people
(obviously the high leveled people) that I was taking
donations for the sick and elderly halflings of Riverdale!
They'd snicker at my comment then hand me a few plat.
I also went around and collected Misty Acorns and sold
18 of them for 60pp to some druid. There are tons of ways
to make money, without paying REAL money for it.

Just be creative and have fun!
