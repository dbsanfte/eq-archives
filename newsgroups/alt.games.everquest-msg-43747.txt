Unfortunately, Verent couldn't give a flying filibuster about minority
groups whose handicaps negatively affect their game-playing experience in
EQ.

I can't count the number of times I have died and lost experience due to my
particular handicap, which takes me away from the computer with *no* time to
do something like get off a gate (which I might have to sit and memorize, as
I don't always have it handy) and make sure it did not collapse, or camp out
(even in the last second a mob can hit you and there goes your camp
attempt).
