    And the really bad part about KEI is that I'm right :P Your lack of KEI
has been hampering your groups :P

    Excuse me? Please to be taking your lame-assed bitterness out on
somebody else? I made mid 40's before I *ever* got KEI cast on my main
thankyou, and didn't get luclin until my late 30's. Not that this has
anything to do with our discussion.... god yet another thread that got
turned into KEI-needs-to-be-nerfed.

    Nerf it by all means, put a level limit on it, but a caster grouping
without it, if they CAN get it, is letting that group down. You can insult
me all you like but the math is very obvious on that one.

    A well reasoned argument there if I ever saw one.

    Tash is cheap, clarity..... see KEI.... stuns...... less important than
haste ;) I assume you left slowing out for political reasons and Mezzes?
Single pulling is your friend...

    Actually the best thing a chanter ever did for a group that iv'e seen
was chain pulled for us - finish off one mob and turn around and theres one
handily mezzed behind you. Was very nice. Try that one without C3? She was
running her mana down and we had to rotate her with another puller but that
was the best chain pulling I've ever seen. Fantastically done. A man with
your talents could no doubt do better, if he only had the mana :)

    You can regen 460 mana in 5.5mins standing up and running around you
know ;)

    Plenty of things in the game need nerfing. I think my last weapon, the
weighty polearm, was an absolute rort. Cost me 250pp and did more damage
than a pissed off girlfriend, not to mention downright silly Agi and AC
bonuses. All for less money than the worst piece of armour I'm wearing. But
with every man and his dog carrying one and my last weapon being a mithril
two handed sword, do you think I'll pass up a sweet doomstick like that just
because I think it should've cost a few thousand plat more? Nein!

    Well er, yes the 5 seconds I spend in nex getting KEI could be spent
slowly beating mobs to death with Augmentation for haste lol.

    On the other hand for the last few levels I wouldn't have minded Aug for
haste because it brings my total haste up to it's pre-51 cap of 50% I think.
(fbss 21% aug 30%?) That's changed a bit since i hit 51 tho :)

    Noob indeed :P

    Well, SK's can't viably solo without it (yeah someone can come in here
and disagree with that but I'd like to see them zero- or near-zero-downtime
solo without it) and with the spells I have now if I grouped without it I'd
be doing significantly less damage due to less nuking, so I try to get it if
I'm going to group, because it helps the group.

    Will group with them but will be a bit miffed if they fail to do their
job. I don't ask them if they have KEI before I group up.

    Yeah single pulling is nice..... chain pulling is excellent. Never seen

    Yeah I try to get aego or virtue if I'm going to tank for a group, but
they're a lot harder to get.

    Well ok maybe that statement was a little over the top :)

    How about "Hey you're probably a brilliant chanter, but an average one
with c3 is doing more for his groups than you are"?

    I mean, it you probably are a brilliant chanter, but if worryign about
not having enough mana for mezzes keeps you from buffing where a buff would
be appropriately beneficial to your group, in god's name go and get a c3
like everyone else and stop whining and calling people names.

Cheers,
James
