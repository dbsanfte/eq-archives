Its been about 9 months since I played EQ, so this might be wrong, but....
I found I could 2 box fine using eqwindows (wineq charges money) and having 
just the one install directory.
Didnt need to run eqplaynice or disable sound or anything else, but I did 
run them both in windowed mode (I think this is the only option with 
eqwindows)

Your machine appears slightly higher end than mine, so I doubt you would 
have any problems doing the same.
