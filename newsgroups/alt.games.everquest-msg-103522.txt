So, gosh, you made your NRA-bashing comment without actually knowing in
advance what you were talking about?  Who'da thunk it?

It was implied by your wording, which went out of its way to
specify a "second amendment" type.

The fact that you are basing your slurs on "your imagination"
is duly noted.  That's extremely typical of anti-NRA types.
And I say this after extensive experience with scores of them
in talk.politics.guns.

When you have some facts instead of your prejudices, feel free to 
come back and try again.

Another assumption.  How quaint.  But wrong.  I've been tracking
the exploits of anti-gun activists for nearly 10 years now.
When it comes to firearm issues, I don't speak up without
a firm foundation for my statements.

No argument there.

But the point is that there's huge irony in the fact that
the anti-gun activists have actually committed more mayhem
with firearms than the folks they accuse of being those
"bloodthirsty pro-gun nuts".

Similarly, a popular canard is that gun owners somehow
confuse their firearms with their penises, and yet I have
a *gigantic* file of newsgroup posts from *anti*-gun writers
who strangely felt compelled to start talking about penises
when the subject of firearms came up.  If anyone's got
an obsessive mental link between firearms and penises,
it's not the *pro*-gun folks.  A small sampling:
