Uhm, I may be missing something. In the year and a half that I was gone, 
Verant actually made instruments affect mezzing in any way? I've just 
came back and went on with my normal mezzing

It depends. I haven't tried the level 27 charm in a while. If it still 
lasts 18 seconds, then I wouldn't use it for crowd control. I've tried a 
long time ago, died a dozen times and gave up on it. But then again, 
I've never quite gotten the hang of 18 second charm (yes, I tried).
Some people do like it. Try it, see what happens

> I imagine alot of people surrender, and run off to play easier classes.

I wouldn't say it's hard to play a bard. I also played a monk, shaman, 
mage and a beastlord. Monk was harder to play than the bard (in some 
situations), but they are all not very easy to play WELL. Playing a bard 
is kinda tedious though.
Although now that I'm thinking about it, pulling in a dungeon as a bard 
can have its interesting sides. I've combined lull and charm song to 
break camps in some dungeons and it can get tough. It can also get very 
bloody if your lull is resisted, so I try not to do that any more :)

Yup. And the higher level you are, the weaker is the warrior in you 
(though it might change a bit higher again). From my sad little parses I 
do about 1/4 to 1/3 of a warriors damage, and take it even worse. That 
is with weapons. With instruments I can outdamage warriors by a large 
margin

> A well played bard has the potential to surpass any other class,

Depends on how you measure it. Bards are situationally useful. They can 
never get close to the insane DPS of the real damage dealers 
(monk/rogue/mage/ranger/etc.)

Aye. Not many classes can compare to bards in this department
