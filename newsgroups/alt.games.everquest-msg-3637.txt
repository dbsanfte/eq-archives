In a group that is pushing its limits, there will be some deaths now and
then.  Deciding who dies is an important skill of a good cleric.

A good cleric makes dying easier, by the way.  I don't mind dying when I
play with a certain Cleric friend of mine, because I know that he will
recognize quickly when things are going bad and we are gonna get wiped
out, and he will make sure the people that need to live for recovery
will make it.  We've been wiped out with him as Cleric, but we've never
had any getting quick resses and getting back into the dungeon.
