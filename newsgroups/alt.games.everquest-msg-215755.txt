Corpse retrievals really aren't a problem. There are no respawns, so
you don't have to worry about mobs between you and your corpse if the
group cleared everything along the way. If they didn't, then half an
hour after the adventure ends (either through success or fail), the
corpses (along with any players inside) get spit out to the outside of
the zone-in.

(I'm sure a cleric could make a killing offering rezzes in the zones
with LDoN entrances...)
