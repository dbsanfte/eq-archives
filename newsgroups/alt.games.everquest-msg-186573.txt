I can see your problem.  With only 4 hours a week to play it's
virtually impossible to make anything other than glacial progress in
Everquest.  This is why a lot of people play Druids and Necros, so
that the 30 mins snatched now and then can lead to some progression.

Alas I've seen time constraints crush people before, they don't
actually have enough free time to make EQ any fun so the times they
do log on are often depressing and sad - the equivalent of turning up
at the pub once a fortnight at random and hoping someone you know is
around only to find out they all moved to the private strip club over
the street which you cannot get into.

Err, or something.
