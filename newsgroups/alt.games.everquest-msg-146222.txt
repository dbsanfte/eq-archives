I never professed that I was correct....  Was just going off the
information that I understood to be correct...    ok so you have
restated the previous information in the thread... so   answer you own
question...   I do not have the answer...  I can only go of the
information I have at hand, and my Logic rolls from that stem...

goblin Men....  goblin males?  goblin-humans?  now we are in
conjecture.  

did a little web searching... and found a few links: (as we all know,
what we find on the web can be taken with a grain of salt... (read
could be true, may not be true))

http://www.daimi.aau.dk/~bouvin/tolkien/orcandgoblin.html
this one discusses the inconsistency of Orc / Goblin being used.

http://fan.theonering.net/middleearthtours/orcs.html
this one about half way down states:
Some LotR fans have been alarmed to learn that in the movies, Saruman
hatches Uruk-hai from eggs or pods. Tolkien makes it clear in LotR
that Uruks are the result of cross-breeding between humans and orcs.

http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/default.htm?http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/o/orcs.html
and yet even more specific information about ORCS  click on the Goblin
hypertext....  some interesting information:

Is there a difference between an 'Orc' and a 'Goblin'? The following
quote from the foreword to The Hobbit sheds some light on this: "[The
word 'Orc'] occurs in one or two places but is usually translated
goblin (or hobgoblin for the larger kinds)." (Hence the statement
above; 'especially the smaller kinds'). This entry concentrates on the
goblins of the Grey and Misty Mountains simply because it is these
Orcs that Tolkien most frequently refers to by the term 'goblin'. 
The word 'goblin' is also used occasionally and indiscriminately in
The Lord of the Rings; it never occurs in the The Silmarillion. 

maybe this information can help us all out ....
