Every customer rep that I have ever talked to in EQ know less about how the
game works then I do . She perhaps knows more . That in itself puts her far
above many other choices .

Sniping at the competition is a well honored tradition and one I certainly
dont want to see changed . The equalizer and duracell comercials are some of
the funniest things I have ever seen. The second class phones commercial the
baby bells had was also funny as all hell. Almost all batteries sold in the
uninted states are name brand while the rest of the world uses generic
batteries . Most americans have a pathological hatred of the baby bells and
wont touch any product they sell with a 10 foot pole. Basically what im
trying to say is that while sniping might help a customer try your product
it aint gonna keep you using a bad one.

My guess is that she has made no actual money in the buisness of ranting .
Im also gonna guess that her new job will not be ranting at the public . I
am certainly not going to prejudge her as unable to communicate to customers
in a service support role because she can communicate a really good rant .
My guess would be that she got an oppurtunity for the job precisely because
she can communicate well.
