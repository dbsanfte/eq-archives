You don't NEED Luclin to sell goods.  I'm sure EC and Faymart are
still going to be /auc hubs, not to mention that the server wide
auction channels will still be going strong.  The Bazaar is just a
perk for those who shelled out the money for Luclin, and more power to
them.

For the two classes that can port, yeah, heading to EC or GFay is
cake.  For all the other classes though, binding in the Nexus/Bazaar
is the way to go though.  And travel on Luclin is NOT that bad.
Granted, he has SoW, but my ranger can make a circuit of the entire
place in about a half an hour, maybe 45 minutes if he wants.  If
you're as far away as Scarlet Desert, you can be to the Bazaar in the
time it take a person to wait on the spires to fire up to the moon.

I have never understood this aversion people have to travel in EQ
though.  My untwinked level 15 troll Beastlord has be all over
Antonica and Faydwyer, and is now based in Shar Vhal.  Sometimes it
takes a little forethought, inviso potions to get through Paladual,
but like they say, getting there is half the fun.

Speaking as a druid, I'm glad they don't.  Hunting in Luclin is nice
for me because the random "Port plz" requests are much fewer and
farther between.
