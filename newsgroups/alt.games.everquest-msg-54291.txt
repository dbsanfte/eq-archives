My 2cp,

I'm of the opinion that it's polite to ask first. If you want to run
around inspecting people without asking, that's fine. Don't be surprised
if people get annoyed though.

What you think of those who don't like it when they're inspected is really
irrelevent. If some here want to call them neurotic, wound-too-tight,
whatever, well... welcome to Norrath. Just like real life there are those
who could care less, and those who will kill you without hesitation if you
look at them crosseyed.

So if I don't like being inspected without being asked first, don't bother
getting all bent out of shape about how <insert derogatory adjective here>
I am. 

Why I don't like it? Because I don't like rude people. Why don't I turn
off the message? Because I want advance warning that I'm dealing with a
rude person. 

I've saved myself a lot of time and grief by knowing in advance of the
first /tell that I'm not going to help/sow/clarity/port the idiot in the
first place.

I consider the "so-n-so is inspecting you" message the systems way of
saying "Don't waste your time on so-n-so, they're not worth a damn
anyway".
