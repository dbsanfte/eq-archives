first of all folks...i could give a shit about the account. Second of
all...the friend i speak of is an ex-leadhand of mine that i never met
outside of work (sorry for mixing friend in there...stupid me), third....I
cant get a hold of guildies because they never did give me (and...i didnt
ask...for the password to the guild site). i just play...and play. Point
is....the account which was active (but no longer), I was given an e-mail
stating that i have 3 months to re-activate it befor its gone for good ( so
im asuming ). Some folks just thought id be crazy to give the account
away...so...i decided to try here befor i do just that. And yes....I did try
to contact the only guildie that left his -email addy on a guildie message
board (i got no reply). Guild is Moonlight Crusaders ( if any fellow
guildies read this...e-mail me....and accout is your's for the taking..or
find another fellow guildie to e-mail me.)

And as for the fellows that like to slam my message....have the guts to
e-mail me first and find out some info first instead of flying off the
handle with asumptions. As far as I'm concerned....the account is gone...one
way or another. Not worth the price of CD's was said?...maybe so...took me 2
years of playing to have the little I have. (no....i was not blessed with
the 2 box concept....or even the ability to concider such an account
worthless.) But the items alone are well worth much more then the CD's...and
yes...i'll await some message stating the a few of the items listed are
old...worthless...easy to get...blah...blah. To them I say....sorry i just
didn't have that lvl 65 cleric you always wanted...but then again...I could
always lie to you.

I just hope a guildie reads this..so I can at least explain my reasons for
leaving. If anyone reading this has any connection to Moonlight Crusaders
(like Moon Valor), please e-mail me. And to all the rest of you
EQ'ers...play well...hard... like I did..and in the end....when all is said
and done...and your bored out of your mind looking for someting to
do.....dont bother trying to sell your account. Let it rot...for heaven only
knows, its not worth the flaq you'll get from the ubers in EQ that still
think that Lady Vox is still a newbie.
