I think the legal system is based heavily on precedents isn't it? Hmmn - I
think the best thing that could happen would be for someone to sue
themselves for gross negligence and stupidity and win. I think that one
single precedent would improve the legal system dramatically.

I would volunteer myself for the task as I am sure I qualify on a number of
counts, but the Crown* would surely use the insanity loophole in my case.
Any relatively sane person want to take one for team?

: )


The Crown* - I am in Australia for those that wonder what the heck that
means - I think you guys in the US would say "The State" or the "The People"
or something.
