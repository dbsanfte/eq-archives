I agree completely.  And for a lot of people it's simply not an option
to do day-long camps for items due to real-life stuff.  

What I wish they would do (of course I doubt it will ever happen) is
make it so you could do some of the quests where, instead of having to
wait a day and a half for a mob to spawn, have the mob spawn like
every half hour and then get the item, but when you turned the item in
to the quest giver, you might not get the item you want, but an
alternate item of lesser value, so you would have to do the quest
again.

For example, with the Bullsmasher quest (a nice 1HB newbie weapon for
short races), you had to get the items, combine in a box and then give
to the Gnome Warrior guildmaster who gives the quest.  But it was rare
that you got the Bullsmasher on the first try and you would usually
get something like some cloth armor instead, and would have to do the
quest over and over, often a lot of times (I think some people had to
try over 40 times before they got the Bullsmasher).  

But the Red V mob (the mob you needed to kill to get the combine box)
spawned fairly often (I'm not sure, maybe between 15-30 minutes) so
somebody who had limited play time could still do the quest; if they
didn't get the Bullsmasher the first night, they could try again
another night.  So maybe it would add up to 24 hours' play time to do
the quest, but it would be 24 hours spread out over a week or
whatever, not all at one sitting.

Of course, the Bullsmasher is a low level quest, and, like I said, I
highly doubt SOE would consider doing anything like this for any of
the high-level quests for epics or uber items, though, since they seem
to feel (and I imagine a number of players agree) that if you want the
uber stuff you have to be willing to make the special effort to get
it, but it's nice to dream anyway.

Anyway, sorry for rambling!
