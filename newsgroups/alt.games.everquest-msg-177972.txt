   Good advice.  And yet, the guy must be doing _some_ business
or he would lower his prices.

The bazaar on Test is annoying in another respect.  No opal
stiens.  I have looked and looked.  Others have found them.  The
only pair I've ever heard of being for sale were when I auctioned
in the PoK.  I got a bite from someone who had a pair, but
wouldn't part with them for less than 200p for the pair.  I only
had 173p to my name at the the time.  /sigh.

   For those that are interested on how the AGE guild thing on
Test is going:

   We are for in the most part in our mid twenties, though
several of us have younger alts.  We are not leveling that
quickly now, and an experienced player should be able to catch up
to us quickly if they wanted to.  Usually when we get together
for our Monday Night Fights, we have enough for 2 groups.  On
Wensdays, we usually have one full group, sometimes more.  We
have had a few of our members drop out or take sabbaticals.  We
have the numbers to get guilded, and have had the name "Age of
Discovery" approved, but have not not luck getting a GM to anwser
our petition.  Still, serverwide.agetest:agetest does serve as a
ghetto guild chat for the moment, so the lack of tag isn't a real
hinderance. 

  Our message board is at: http://pub75.ezboard.com/bagetestgroup
.

   Yes, I'm still trying to lure some of you to Testside to join
us.
