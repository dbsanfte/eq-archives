There are still quite a few spells which are research only. A lot of people
seem to have given up with research making the spells even harder to
find. I've found that I can buy the words for mid level necro spells
for a few platinum each and sell the resulting spells for a few hundred
platinum very quickly in the bazaar. If I could be bothered to get my
research
skills up enough to do the high levels spells I bet I could make even
more money.,
