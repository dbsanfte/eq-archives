> That's open to debate. The artistic styles are so different between
the two games that it is hard to tell what the WoW engine can do.

The WoW engine may or may not be at its maximums.  The fact is that to
most people, WoW looks "cartoony" and EQII looks much more complex.

> Also, this is irrelevant, because Doom 3 runs on Cedega, and its
engine is way ahead of EQ2's engine.

I doubt either one of us is qualified enough to determine which engine
is ahead of the other, but I can at least apply your same logic to
EQII vs. Doom 3: "The artistic styles are so differnet between the
two games..."

> What I want to know is what happened to the EQ2 engine that was used
for the demos around a year or so ago?

SOE admitted that they had to bring the engine back down to be more
friendly with current technology.  When the next advances in
computers (CPUs, memory, video cards, etc.) come out, you will very
likely see EQII hold up better than WoW's engine.

I'm not saying this is an advantage or disadvantage for EQII.  Both
EQII and WoW are great games, they are just different.  I don't
consider one better or worse than the other, I enjoy both.  And I
don't go into other games newsgroups and insult them and their
players or accuse the vendors of lying to sell a few more boxes.
