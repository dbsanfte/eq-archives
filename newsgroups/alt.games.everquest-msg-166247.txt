Pardon my lack of memory...
Recently someone posted requesting people to list all the Epic Quests after
difficulty. I found it very amusing, but forgot to take further notice.
Could all you experienced players help me out again, please? I would like to
see that list again. :-)
And does anyone know if there's a website that has SOLID runthrough of all
the Epic Quests? I find the ones at eq.castersrealm.com to be a little short
for my liking...
Any help appreciated!
