Several ways.....In the latest expansion, PLanes of Power many locations
have a Book/Pedestal object nearby to major locations. These connect with
the PLane of Knowledge and form a rapid transport system. THis is true for
any of the expansion areas.

Shadows of Luclin sort of added a fast transport system. The expansion
focuses on the moon and a series of zones there - essentially another
continent. One of the zones is called the Nexus....from here, a bunch of
pads operate a teleport system, one goes to the big spires in North
Karana, another to the same spires in Greater Faydark, another to
Dreadlands in Kunark, another is shared between the Great Divide in
Velious and Tox Forest on Odus....basically these meant that you could
move between continents rapidly without external assistance and cross from
one continent to another in about half an hour.

In the original game wizards and druids have been able to port people
around, wizards to various spires around the world, Druids to druid rings
scattered about the game forming connections

For those who dont have such a friend or the extra expansion the base
system is boats, like the ones from East Freeport to Butcherblock and from
Erudin to Qeynos

Getting to Kunark - you have two options tied to faction. Good people use
the docks in Butcherblock....there are two jetties in BBM the right hand
one looking at the water goes across to Freeport, the left hand one, the
four little shuttles go to Kunark...get on these, they transfer you out to
Timorous deep and meet an ENORMOUS boat, you hop on that boat and it then
zones into Firiona Vie and the outpost there - on the way out again it
stops at an elf island then back to the shuttles....its worth doing the
trip once so you can say you did it and have a look at the impressive
boats but no more than that (I wish they had allowed those boats to be
more useful....but its a great place to sucker a caster into duelling)
The trip one way can take 30-45 minutes plus waiting time.

THe second option is to go down to the jetty in the Oasis of Marr (2 zones
out of East Freeport heading south [EFP-NRO-Oasis]). There you with find
the barrel barge turning up at a regular interval....hop on here and get
take to the ogre island in Timorous Deep....you can land here safely no
matter what your faction, but the ogre camp is a transit point for those
of the nastier persuasion. They get on another ship which takes them to
the Overthere outpost on Kunark.

Finally Velious - Everyone can boat one way...go to North Ro....get on the
raft, and travel to the Iceclad Ocean...change on an island and get on the
Icebreaker. That takes you to Velious proper and you get off and enter the
continent there.
