Actually, I thought I did a good job in specifically separating the two.  I
stated that true socialism is closer to capitalism than fascism.  Communism
is simply fascism with a socialist veneer, rather than a capitalist face
(associating fascism with capitalism or socialism is like associating Ford
with Blue or Red... Henery Ford's orginal color selections not withstanding:
"They can have them in any color they want, as long as it's black.").  What
I'm objecting over, is the use of government regulation as evidence of
socialism.  Regulations existed before socialism came about.  Even a pure
capitalist economy can have a degree of regulation.  Consider it at the
opposite end of the spectrum from Lazzie-Faire, vice the opposite end from
capitalism.  The fact that we rarely hear Lazzie-Faire other than when it's
linked to capitalism (and the fact that it makes little sense when linked
with socialim) presents a bit of a false picture of capitalism.

Which is kind of dubious, in it's own right.  Anyways, it's presented as a
retirement program, so I will judge is by that.  Yes, I hold the politicians
accountable for their own rhetoric.

Can we just euthanisme them instead?

That was a rhetorical question.  I think it should be perfectly acceptable
to end those in a period instead of a question mark....

Except for the fact that the government has shown itself to be quite
wasteful with the money.  Private charities have a much smaller overhead,
and more of the dollars make it to the intended recipients.  They're also
able to be more selective about said recipients.  Maybe this could be
overhauled, but given the cancerous growth of any govenrment program, I have
my doubts.

But that would be insensitve, and we couldn't have that... then the welfare
recipients wouldn't vote for us.

Somehow, I can't help recalling the idea Neil Boortz had for foodstamps.
Have a special checkout lane specifically for foodstamps, and before the
"customer" was able to complete the purchase, they would have to personally
thank the first person (read: taxpayer) in every other lane for paying for
the food.

Well, back when they actually handed out the crappy food, instead of letting
people "buy" it a the grocery store, things were a bit different.
