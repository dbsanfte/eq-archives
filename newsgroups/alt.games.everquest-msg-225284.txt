Davian,
I'm willing to bet I've spent as much on my enchanter as you'll find spent
on any melee outside of the elemental planes, and frankly I've got crap
gear.  KEI is the caster equivalent of haste; I'd no more ask a caster to go
into a fight without mana regen than I would ask a melee to go into a fight
without haste.  The difference is that casters have to pay a chanter to KEI
them before the fight (if they don't have a KEI-capable chanter in the
group), while the melee get haste for free for being grouped with a bard,
shaman, beastlord or enchanter.

Twinking a melee, 100kp of gear.
Twinking a caster, 100kp of spells PLUS 100kp of gear.  Hell, I spent 100kp
on buying FIVE spells, and I haven't been able to afford a copy of VoQ yet!
And I have the cheapest possible horse and FT1.  Or do you pay any attention
to the drop rate of silk compared to plate?

Don't cry poor comparing your cost to a caster's, it's an old argument and
long disproven.

As for melee outdamaging casters:  My 65 wizard, using his most efficient
spells and the whole manabar (close to 6K mana), can do less than five
percent of the HP on a Velious named.  On a PoP named, he does better but
can't go all-out because of aggro issues.  (Please don't think I'm of the
opinion that melee don't need help, I'm all in favor of it.)  My enchanter
usually does better damage than the wizard can - using a hasted,
dire-charmed pet or a non-hasted charmed pet.  This while rangers Trueshot
for higher DPS than my wizard can do at full burn, rogues backstab for more
damage than my most efficient nuke every eight seconds (Agnarr's Thunder
does 2308compared to a double-backstab for 1100 each = 2200) never run out
of the ability to do so, and can reliably shed the aggro from it; monks are
widely known for doing just less damage than a rogue.  Melee do reliably
outdamage casters, because they can go all-out and shed aggro, whereas
casters can't - pity the necros and mages, with no equivalent to the Jolt
line.  Mana regeneration is like health regeneration, irrelevant to the
aggro issue.

The problem is that you're looking at the wrong numbers.  Because of the
limitations of the manapool, casters do more damage over the short term,
melee over the long term.  You're well into the elemental planes before mana
regen during a fight is a significant factor; far more important at all
levels is mana conservation and size of mana pool - which is equivalent to
the size of your HP pool and your damage mitigation.  And that's what we
both spend money and AAs to improve.

The coming changes are shit.  They serve only to make warriors MORE
dependent on the random-number generator than they were before.  Nobody gets
a tank for the possibility of getting aggro when the server feels like it;
they get a tank for reliable, proven ability to get aggro.  This is a bone,
and a not-very-effective one at that.
