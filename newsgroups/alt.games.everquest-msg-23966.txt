Can anyone give me the directions to find Wolf's Eye Agate to use in a
pottery deity recipe?  Also, if the location of a vendor selling Sands of Ro
is known, that would be helpful.  I know that it falls from Sand Giants, but
I've seen messages indicating that a vendor sells it in SRo Desert.  I
suspect it might have been there from a PC selling to a NPC, but was hoping
someone might know otherwise.

Thank you in advance...
