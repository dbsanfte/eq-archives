Pfeh.  My main is level 18 and it's STILL unpleasant, but the penalties of
death aren't really what bug me.  What gets me is that I have died about
twenty times from what I consider blatant highway robbery on the game's
part.  I've had Martar Icebear spawn less than an arm's length away from me
twice.  I've died half a dozen times from lag at off-peak hours.  I've had
griffons approach me without me hearing their wings flapping on at least
five occasions, and I get my sound through headphones turned up loud with
music set to none.  I've never had a glitch like that work FOR me.  Those of
you who are saying "It's just a little bad luck" or "you're just paranoid"
don't know me.  I used to get the same kind of thing in table-top.  I'm the
only Werewolf player I know whose characters botch more often than they
succeed.  Those of you who don't believe in luck should watch me play.
(/bitch)

My point is: If I die because I overextended myself, or because I got one
add too many, or because I wasn't paying attention, or if I just plain get
bad dice rolls, that's fine.  But I really, really hate it when glitches,
lag, or awkward mechanics in the game kill me.  Death is inevitable at some
point, but I want it to be my fault.
