You happen to be lucky then.  When I used SoE's EQIM, it had a random chance of
crashing itself.  Not to mention, it didn't even work properly from the start
for people of Fennin Ro.  (The chat server calls us fenninro.player but the
EQIM program calls us fennin.player, so we can't add Fennin Ro people to our
friends list or join Fennin Ro chat rooms)

Also, for people who are on a newer server since EQIM came out, they were out
of luck.  (Maelin Starpyre, etc)

I see this as a welcomed 'upgrade', since SoE abandoned the program.
