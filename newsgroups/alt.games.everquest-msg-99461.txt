I wear coldain skin. I had GE boots for a couple weeks before that
(wore gnomeskin boots prior to this) but didn't like the metal look
and fell instantly in love when I got to try on the coldain skin boots
someone I grouped with had - dark leather AND great wis/mana. 
There is absolutely nothing below the 'insanely uber' category I'd be
willing to replace them with, and even then, I would pass on something
that looked like plate.
