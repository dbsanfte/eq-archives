Every time I've ever seen anyone (including myself) lose exp due
to a DoT death, it was because they ran *OUTSIDE* the arena area and
*then* died to the DoT.

Arenas are coded so that if you die in them (key word *in*), you don't lose
exp, period.  It's a simple thing to code, and I don't see how Sony could
screw it up -- nor have I seen any indication that they have.  You can
even die to NPCs in an arena and lose no exp (I've done it dozens of
times, it's my favorite way to get myself killed on purpose when I
want to leave a corpse -- aggro an arena guard).

The only exception is the arena in Kael, which was explicitly excluded from the
"no exp loss period" code in a patch because people were abusing it by leading
their raids from inside it, making them immune to any exp loss while
raiding.

The reason that DoTs will result in exp loss *outside* an arena
is because the game has no way of being able to tell that you
acquired the DoT during a duel.  For all it knows an NPC might
have DoTed you.  Thus any DoT death which takes place outside the
arena is an exp-loss death.  And DoTs got this bad rep because
it's impossible to die due to a DD outside the arena (the instant
you step out, no one can land any DD damage on you).

So if you get DoTed during a fight in an arena
and it looks as if you're going to croak, STAY IN the arena
to die.

I've died from DoTs *inside* arenas several times, and never
lost exp from it.
