    At very low levels, regen pulls you through fights that you'd otherwise
lose. Regen also means not having to burn mana on heals, so less downtime.
As you level it becomes ignorable, but at lower levels it's very nice.

    Oh, lord. It doesn't last long, but the Innothule is *incredible* for
those first few levels. Almost all the mobs are social, which means past
level 1 you get all sorts of pulls without having to look (like the Scaled
Wolf Pups in FoB). Mow 'em down as fast as possible. Where to fight is also
pretty easy - stick to the zone wall between Grobb and Upper Guk. There's
two islands right within sight of the zone wall with enough spawns to
support an army - just keep pulling and pulling, and smushing frogs. Once
you hit level 9 or so, move to the skeleton camps in the Feerrott - again,
constant pulls, and they're right near zone walls for easy navigation.

    Iksar never need to leave Kunark to go quite high in level. And when
they DO leave, it can be to Luclin or Velious where they aren't hated/as
hated. Ogres and trolls can go pretty far just in the crescent of zones
between Oasis and Lake Rathetear - that's at most a two-zone trot from a
home city (assuming they don't go KOS to the others' guards). Lake
Rathetear, Rathe Mtns, Cazic Thule, Upper/Lower Guk, SRo and Oasis is a LOT
of levelling goodness. 8)
