On Monster Missions, no, but they are a special case.

Nor on your pet, either.  If I want to hang on to my beastlord pet
(maybe it has V or whatever) during a lengthy logout, I just Shroud
myself.  Then, if I log in again in again, I just take the Shroud off
- and there's the pet, with all his nice buffs.

Doesn't work for Summoned Items though, as they go poof after the
usual interval.
