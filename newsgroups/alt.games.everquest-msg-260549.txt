I remember the description of the monk character as being nearly as powerful
naked as fully equipped and fully capable of soloing. Having lost a level 12
paladin's body whose gear I had painfully scraped together, I found i stated
an iksar monk, and at the low levels it was kind of true, but at the grand
level of 30 i found it hard to get into groups because of gear issues and
the fact that, even though i had started with kunark, most of the people
there had alts who soloed hill giants for cash hour after bleedin' hour so
they could twink other characters, and so didn't want to have a party member
without the awseome dps of someone with a lammy (I kid you not).

I don't know what movie, or book, or graffiti on a toilet door they were
reading when they designed the monk character, but the eq monk is certainly
not someone who is spiritual, unworldly, humble or even capable of fighting
bare-handed for the most part. The need money just as much as any other
char, and i've played all classes except bard until at least 20, and most to
40 now. They can't beg, because the beg skill, far from doing what it might
represent in reality, provokes other townspeople and guards into a killing
frenzy. Umm, the monks of asia and india of today don't seem to get that
response? The European monks calling for alms didn't have to replace their
arms immediately afterwards. What were they thinking?

I don't know if it's really possible to have a decent roleplaying game
online, but i remember my really deep disappointment when i realised that
everquest, for all the fun i have had with it, is really just loot and
bashing, and that you can't really choose to be good or evil as such within
the game, since the faction system is broken and doesn't look like it will
ever be fixed. Why is barbarian faction so much harder to improve than the
faction with the paladins of north freeport? How can killing orcs make me
ally with a bunch of guys who don't fight orcs (the militia do) but killing
goblins and ice giants doesn't impress their mortal enemies, the barbarians?
Why does wolf form turn some mobs psychotic? It all reminds me so much of
futurama when the evil brain left the earth "for no raisin" (sic).

I'm hoping that the next expansion will go back towards some sort of game
continuity (the wayfarers make no sense at all, in the same way that having
dark elf npc's appear who will port you about for no benefit but who dribble
on about how much they loathe you at the same time does) but i really think
it will just be how to bash and loot stuff more, and in a way that's ok,
cause if EQ won't recognise my roleplaying then I'll damn well do it
guerilla style, and level to the point where i can solo those stupid evil
undercons they placed in 'good' newbie zones allied to good factions
(qeynos, anyone?), finally get the epic/s that are so hard for people in
certain time zones (australia!) or who are casual to get, even when they are
now essentially irrelevant for most classes (ok not clerics).
