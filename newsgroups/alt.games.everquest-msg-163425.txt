Just how exactly would one expect tradeskills to work?
How many hours/days/weeks/months/years does a blacksmith sink into
developing basic proficiency?  Learning to make blades?  Learning
to make pieces of armor?  Learning to make blades and armor that are
truly superior?  Learning to do these things well enough that they
are completed in a reasonable amount of time (that is, particular
techniques and designs are learned so well that failures and rework
become rare)?  Becoming skilled enough to merit being called a master?
Becoming worthy of being called a grandmaster?

I've asked these questions before, and all I heard was the chirping
of crickets.
