According to Tom's you really don't want the low end FX's.  They are too
slow with DX9 features enabled.  Additionally, for a similar cost you
can still get GF4 Ti4200's for $80 and they outperform the low end FX's
in DX8.1 specific benchmarks.  Since they share the same driver set,
all Nvidia cards from the TNT up to the FX5900 ultra are DX9 compliant.
