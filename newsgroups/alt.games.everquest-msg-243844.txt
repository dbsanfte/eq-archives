Yep, you're right.

Well, if you go and do it in a spot that's completely out of the way, you're
definitely minimizing the chances that someone will come along and pick it
up.  Of course, if you do it in an unremarkable spot way out in the middle
of nowhere, you run the risk of not actually being able to find the spot
again because of its unremarkableness.  (Well, at least I can see this
happening to me in one of my weaker moments)  And again, I can't imagine if
a newbie (or most anyone else, really) sees a bag just sitting under a tree
or in a room or whatever, they're not going to pick it up, if for no other
reason than to see what it is.  Maybe it's just fishing grubs, but there's a
miniscule chance that maybe it's *A Cloak of Flames*, and how difficult is
it to pick something up off the ground to make sure?

That's the thing with EQ though, you can't conceal something alongside a
road.  It's not as if you can bury it, or cover it up with brush or
something.  It's just going to be a bag sitting out there.
