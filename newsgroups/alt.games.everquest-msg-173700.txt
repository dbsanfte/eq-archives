There's a book in BBM.  None in WC (You mean West Commons right?), but
there's one in EC and it's not like EC is a really dangerous zone to run
through to get to WC... well, there's orc pawns, the nasty little buggers,
but if you're *really* highlevel and can run *really*, *really* fast you can
survive Death By Orc Pawns (DBOP, mention it in a group of players and
they'll immediately go into fetal position, try it and see).
