The rant wasn't about "acting stupid".  Try reading it again.

Here are the things she griped about in her "guide rant":

  1.  Players who petition about ridiculously trivial stuff
      (e.g., "someone stole my orc").

  2.  Players who do things like petition because they
      ROLLED FOR AN ITEM AND THEN LOST THE ROLL.

  3.  Players who abuse the guides for not being able to
      rez them (examples given:  accusing the guide of
      "hating" them, or implying that the guide *would*
      have rezzed them if they had been in an uber-guild).

  4.  Players who send repeated direct nagging tells to the
      guides, after already being informed that they need
      to /petition and wait their turn.

  5.  Players so brain-dead that they, for example, petition
      that the boats are broken just because they've been
      waiting three minutes and haven't see one yet.

  6.  Players who ruin GM-run RP events by doing nothing but
      trying to kill the GM NPCs.

  7.  Players who petition in illegible dewd-speak instead
      of using English.

  8.  Players who submit petitions that say something
      totally cryptic like "Hurp."

  9.  Players who are scumbags (examples given:  spamming
      the zone with obscene or offensive material, purposely
      creating trains in order to kill lowbies, trapping
      a female character in the corner and sending her
      obscene tells, cheating people in trades).

 10.  Players who seriously sexually harrass other players,
      *or* who act suggestively then /petition when someone
      responds in kind.

Of these, the only ones that dip into the area of merely
"acting stupid" (as opposed to "acting like an asshole",
or "acting like someone with severe emotional problems", etc.),
are #5 (but even a child should know better), and #8
(because they were probably thinking that "/petition so-and-so"
was the proper way to submit a report about someone's
behavior).

The rest are not about stupidity.

Tweety wasn't ranting about people being dumb, she was
ranting about how some people cause problems for both
the guides and other players.
