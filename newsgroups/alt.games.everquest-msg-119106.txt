That's not a surprise, as you don't seem ever to recall anything
that contradicts your latest pronouncement.  Did you go to Conquest's
web site at the time and read the logs they posted, as I did?  Didn't
think so.

That "fact" is an unproven assertion, similar to another you made
about Verant not having detected "SoW hacks" via server-side equipment
and then disciplined the accounts without any in-game GM observation
or intervention, an event attested to others here (amazingly enough
you disappeared from that thread).  That "fact" is an invention of
yours, cited without any support whatsoever.  While I am willing to
believe that on at least one occassion a GM or Guide has refused to
act on a complaint about abusive language on a guild channel without
a report, that in no way implies that a GM cannot listen in on said
channel.  You're leaping to a conclusion that is unsupported by any
evidence you have cited, in fact you haven't cited any evidence at
all.  And I, for one, am quite confident that it is unsupported by any
evidence you have encountered.

You're slipping DT, this is by a substantial margin the most inane
position I've seen you take in quite some time.
