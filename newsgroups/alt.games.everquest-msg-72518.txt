With all the talk lately of Luclin and upgrading memory, I've been poking
around and am just generally confused.  Have never really added new memory
to any of my PC's so not sure what to look for.  Hope someone can help me
out.

I do know I have a Dell Dimension 8100  with 256 Mb ram.  I have 4 slots for
memory, 2 are being used now so I guess I have two 128 mb "chips" (for lack
of a better description).  System can go up to 2Gb so I guess I could put
four 512mb chips in if so inclined.

But what else do I need to know?  I.e. do I just go into the store and buy
whatever memory they happen to stock?  What is the difference between PC 100
and PC 133 that I see on some on-line store sites?  Is one maker better than
another?  Should I just go through DELL?

Is there a difference between RDRAM and SDRAM (some system stuff of mine
says I have RDRAM - no idea what that means)  And DIMM - whats that?

(Can you tell I am really confused!?!?)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!

Wylbur
