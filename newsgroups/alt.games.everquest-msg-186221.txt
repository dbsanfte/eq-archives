I dinged level 20 a few days ago, and I've gotten myself a 
surname, and recently I saw I didn't carry it anymore. So I 
tried to re-apply it, but it stated I already *had* a 
surname. Moreover, I couldn't see other's people surnames as 
well, and their guilds've been removed from view too.

Now I think this is quite a default setting, but I've seemed 
to overlooked it quite some times since I still can't find 
it.

Any ideas on how to re-activate this ??

Thanks in advance

P.S.
Anyone tried /gems
And/or knows the command to view ones bind point??
