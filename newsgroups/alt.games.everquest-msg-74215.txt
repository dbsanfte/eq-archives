True, they could have, but they didn't, nor did they need to.  Twinking is
simplicity, even without that ability; and you're only addressing
self-twinking.  Also, "some degree to twinking" does not include "level 1
cleric running around with a rez stick."

Also, you're assuming the ability to twink to be an exploit, which you have
not backed up.  How did you know Verant didn't know darn well what would
happen, and decided that it's a minor factor, and not really worth bothering
with?

Fact is, there are already level caps on some items.  If Verant wanted to
stop twinking, they could put those level caps on everything.  The fact that
they haven't says that they really don't care enough about the issue to
bother.  So, it would seem that twinking is not inconsistant with "The
Vision" (TM).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
