I don't think that's necessary.  If more intelligent, mature and cognizant
players post regularly on the EQ boards AND send the same type of feedback
regularly they will be listened to.

I have sent a number of /feedbacks that have been implemented.  I'm not
going to come anywhere near saying that I had a big voice in the matter but
I'm stuck on myself enough to think that I was heard and my tone
appreciated. :)
