I have always wanted to see a rogue quest that actually was fun...

Much sneaking involved, wandering mobs who could see you, on paths that 
once you sorted out their pattern could be determined and slipped 
through safely, some locked doors, some pick-locking to get through, 
some some pickpocketing to get kets to get through others. A pickpocket 
or assasinate of a lowish mob at the end, and a sneak back out. Set it 
up to take 90 minutes.

Be a riot of fun...too bad there would be virtually zero xp for the 
rogue, at least as adventures, and eq mechanics are currently set up.

/agree

I think good solo-able dungeons would really start to require class 
evaluation, even aa and gear evaluation of the individual. Seeing as 
LDon doesn't even scale down when you run 3 people instead of 6 asking 
for individualization might be asking for the moon. At best, i predict 
the we will be 'allowed' to take ldons without a group... and if we're 
lucky they'll lowever level or mob count or something to make success a 
little more likely.
