Wow mabe you do have a point - I have basically now just been healing and
absolutely NOTHING else so that may indeed be an issue at higher levels as
my defense will totally suck when a golem etc will start to aggro.
Interesting idea and thanks for bringing it up. I do not twink because on
another server a friend did the ds and 200 pp routine and my lvl 16 was
hopeless inept under the old leveling system - fizzle fizzle fizzle etc.
That is embarassing and casting on a corpse - at least pick on some green
bandits or orcs that drop bronze lol.
