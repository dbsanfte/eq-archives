Frankly, I do not help others when they intentionally run to any wizard
spires, the windmill, the Oasis docks, or the tunnel connecting EC to N Ro.
I am not playing the game to powerlevel others, and there is usually a
zoneline closeby. Anyone running to a place where higher level folks are
known to hang out will usually repeat this behaviour again and again. And
this sort of ass is equated in my mind with insurance salesmen.

Sometimes I am there resting after a battle, and not at full health/mana.
The last thing I want to see is an angry mob who eats me as well. While the
ass may think he is getting help, what he is doing is intentionally training
the folks there. And for that, he deserves to die.
