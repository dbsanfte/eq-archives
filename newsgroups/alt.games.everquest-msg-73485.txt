We are running Win XP on the new machines.  Immediately after installing the
EQ software, game runs no problem.  However, the second time we have started
the program on each machine we have encountered the following problem:

Our Desktop cursor setting (Currently mine is a Dawg Bone as my Desktop is
Cleveland Browns) appears right in the middle of the screen.  We still have
an actual mouse cursor which is an arrow, but the other cursor is there as
well and is immovable.  Now, I was going to upload a screen shot of this to
the web for you all to see, HOWEVER, that annoying cursor does not appear in
the screen shot??  WTF?  Also, while the immobile cursor is there, each time
we zone, little boxes open up at the bottom of the screen that have the time
and say things like "Loading Everquest" and etc...

Anyone have any ideas?
