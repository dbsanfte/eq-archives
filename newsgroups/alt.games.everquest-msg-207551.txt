How much does Sony frown on macro programs if you don't use them unattended?
I'd like to do some tradeskill stuff, but I'm sure my wrists would not hold
out.  I'm a programmer, and adding EQ *without* tradeskills to that is
pushing things (I suppose playing classical guitar doesn't help, either).

I'm not interested in a macro program that gives an advantage over people
doing it the old-fashioned way (other than the advantage of not destroying
my wrists!)...just something that gets the steps off the mouse.  E.g., if I
had macros for "move one item from this stack to the oven", "move one item
from that stack to the oven", "combine", "move item from cursor to
inventory", and so on, so that each try required pressing a sequence of
keys, would be fine.

Can programmable gamepads handle this, or would I need something like
Xylobot?
