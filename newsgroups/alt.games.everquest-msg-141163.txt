Estrella is a Druid who has a unique 'blinding ink' spell.  Pre Luclin
a level 60 Ranger using a vampire blood potion (for added MR) and a
bit of luck soloed her so not the toughest mob ever.  However she
doesn't drop this shawl but a different one.

The one you want is the rare drop off Undertow (Wiz) who is even more
of a wuss if anything, I think is has Affliction Efficiency II on it
as well now but remains very much an uncommon drop.  Common drop is
the Blazing Wand for the Mage epic.  Erm, I think.
