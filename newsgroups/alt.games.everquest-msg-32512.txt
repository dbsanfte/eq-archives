Here Here!  I agree!

Although I must give credit...  Most NOT ALL of the tanks I group with are
good at keeping the mobs away from the casters...

It is important to judge your healing properly though....  Wait until one of
the mobs is dead or there is a minimum of 2-3 bubbles of health lost from
your tank...

I find good timing reduces the mobs aggro.
