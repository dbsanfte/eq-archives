Yep, tried farming in Akheva and Maidens eye for shadows, got about a stack
in a few hours...not really dropped by the bucket....

This was soloing though, can imagine it would be faster with a couple of
other people, just farming shadows for fletching doesnt seem to excite many
people ;p

My new plan is to use up what I have farmed, then continue farming acrylia,
sell that and skill up fletching through the cash made on sales with
cultural fletching.
