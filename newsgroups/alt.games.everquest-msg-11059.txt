Try instead making the following hotkey:

/doability 1
/g Healing t%.
/cast 1

I put my best healing spell in my top cast slot.  I keep my message short
because enough is flying around during combat.  Don't do an emote or /t.
Only your group needs to know what you're doing.  I haven't had a tank yet
that didn't appreciate knowing what I was doing.  Oh, the first line will
increase your Sense Heading.  By adding it to your hotkey, your Sense
Heading will quickly get to its max everytime you level.

I'd also suggest making a hotkey for when you're hit:

/doability 1
/g Get this %t off of me.  I can't heal if I'm being hit.

Another for when you're out of mana:

/doability 1
/g Out of mana.

It's odd.  Must be faulty programming by Verant.  Everytime I hit my Out of
Mana hotkey during combat, it also somehow is able to trigger:

 /g Oh shit!

...in the voice of one of the tanks.  That or:

/g RUN!!!
