Wherin we learn that VI was spun-off from Sony, and then spun back in.
Basicly, Sony allowed the people at 989 Studios who believed in EQ to
take on more of the risk in exchange for a shot at greater reward.
Pretty standard stuff.  Pretty stupid to believe that this somehow
makes VI/EQ any less "Sony's baby".  Sony backed it financially, Sony
has reaped the lion's share of the financial rewards.  That's the way
business works in a capitalist economy (except when you let lawyers
get too heavily involved, or when an investor grows faint-of-heart
and let's somebody else step up in their place).
