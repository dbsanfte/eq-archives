At extremely low levels, everyone is pretty close to equivalent for 
soloing.  By my teens and 20s, I was easily soloing using run and nuke.  
I was in no way twinked, this is my main, and has been since I created 
him.  Starting wisdom was 95, and stayed around there for quite a while, 
and gave me a perfectly adequate mana pool for soloing.  At the time, 
there was no KEI, and I didn't even know what breeze was yet.  I spent 
99% of my time soloing back then.  Since then, I have soloed a few other 
classes up into the 20s, and did not find any of them to be significantly 
easier at those levels.  Well into my 30s, I was easily soloing yellows, 
was not even using the wonders of root and rot at the time, nor was I 
using a pet.  What can I say, I didn't know the most efficient ways yet.
