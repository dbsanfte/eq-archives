Sorry to hear that my descriptions apparently don't do the system justice. 
After achieving level 15 Scholar with my first character and now level 20 
Alchemist (afaik the only Alchemist on the server), I obviously don't feel 
like I've been engaging in anything stupid, although I will grant that it's 
tedious (as is every other crafting system that I've ever tried, seems the 
nature of the beast).

On the other hand, this is the 2nd time you've referred to this system as 
something that sounds stupid and tedious, and your previous characterization 
of anyone who bought LOE (like me) as "stupid" leads me to believe that 
there probably isnt any chance that my descriptions of this system could 
ever sound anything but stupid to you!
