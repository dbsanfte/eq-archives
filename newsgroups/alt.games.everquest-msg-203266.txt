Oh, god, oh, god, I've managed to avoid this argument for days now,
but I can't, just can't....

Pulp - I understand your frustration, really I do, but several people
HAVE addressed your "pesky little problem" as you so quaintly put it. 
But here, let me state it, out loud in front of everyone:

1. KEI on low level characters means an increased chance that someone
with less skill will level too fast, without learning the basic
composition/role of his class.  This means more basically unskilled
players in dangerous zones, which increases the cahnce of undue risk
to players WITH skill.  Granted, a player with enough skill,
intelligence, and cunning will usually find a way to deal with the
problem anyway, but the point is that skilled players should not HAVE
to deal with it.  Note:  I am not saying that YOU are an unskilled
player - but we're not looking at just you here, but at a large group
of players who are, in general, unskilled and a danger to people in
the zones in which they play. For good examples, see Dreadlands,
Karnor's Castle, Plane of Nightmare, Bastion of Thunder...the problem
has extended itself all the way to Tier 2 planes, and now with the
opening of several planes to everyone of either level 55 or 62
depending on the zone, we can expect that it will extend into Tier 3
before long as well.

2.  The difference between 4 and 14 mana per tick is minor when one's
mana pool is considerable, but for a level 20 or lower caster, the
results are dramatic.  Who needs skill when you have KEI?  So, it
leads to the above problem on a grand scale.


In conclusion, to answer your question, "how does it hurt anyone to
have me and my group with KEI?", the answer is that it probably does
not hurt anyone in your specific case (although I cannot say that this
point is definite, never having observed your playing skills). 
However, the complaints are not about you specifically, but about
anyone who has used KEI to level without increasing his skill level,
thus making many zones far more dangerous than they have to be.  The
discernible majority of players who have become newbies since the
advent of KEI lack skill, and several of the people who played before
KEI but could not level without it also lack skill.

Last thing:  this post has not been intended as an attack; merely an
explanation of why KEI on low level characters is a threat to game
integrity, as well as being a threat to the fun had by players who
actually ARE skilled from bothering to learn the basics of mana
management and class structure.
