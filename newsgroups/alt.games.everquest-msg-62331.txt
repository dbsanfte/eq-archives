As for peices of caster armor, Crystal Covered Shroud, Flowing Black Robe,
White Scaled Tunic, and The Robe of the Keeper; these robes have a price
range from about 800pp to 50pp.

After Raw Silk the next total suit of casters armor is Crystaline Silk. It
has much better AC than raw or even (monk) cured silk and is just a few AC
points short of Wu's Armor. The weight is 0.1 per peice. Crystaline Silk has
a high magic resistance, so it make for a decent default casters armor
(especially when your next best choice is raw silk).

Crystaline Silk is an enchanted armor like Wu's Armor and Enchanted Ornate
Chainmail. So you will need to hunt down a tailor enchanter or something
like that. I know of it because I have made a full suit just to see how it
looks. It is not a common armor because the matterials are expensive to
obtain, and the armor  normally sells for 50pp, 75pp, and 100pp per peice
depending on size.
