For the most part equipment still plays an incredibly small role for a pure
caster . You really just dont need to be that concerned about upgrades like
you would be for any tank type . If you insist look for higher ac, int ,
cha, mana , hps, and resists particularly magic resist.

At your level easy upgrades are all mostly jewelcraft . I would start with a
pair of golden jade bracers, then electrum black sapphire earrings.
