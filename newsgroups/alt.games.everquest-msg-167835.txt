My Character just took the Nexus to Luclin. As the portal started, the game
shut off and said it dosen't have the file nexus. And yes, I do have Shadows
of Luclin installed. And I reinstalled it. No dice. When I attempt to load
my character up, figuring I'll go without Luclin, I find I'm terribly
screwed. His location is listed as the Nexus, and when loading, it says the
same message as above, and shuts off the game. Please Help!!
