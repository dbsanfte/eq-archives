I see both sides of the issue.  When I was a true newbie and didn't
know much, I rolled up a brand new Troll warrior.  I hated that swamp.
 Always got lost, always killed 3 feet from the guards, always swarmed
over by Kobolds or frogloks, or mushroom guys, always met some friggin
elf NPC that killed me in one blow.  And back then, if you died, you
had to find your corpse and trying to figure out where I was when that
happened was difficult.  I deleted and rerolled more than once until I
just gave up on Trolls.

However, a few months ago, I rolled up a Troll Shadowknight.  This
time I was determined to spend my first 9 levels or so in the swamp. 
I discovered the swamp was a great newbie hunting ground.  All the
frustration I had when I was new was gone.  Guk was a great dungeon to
hunt at the entrance and the levels flew by. Amazing what knowing the
way around and having some experience with the game does for you.

I was however, the only newbie troll in the swamp most of the time I
was there.  Most of the others were high levels going to/from Guk (got
a nice 1hs weapon from a 48th level mage).  So I could see them
redoing it to try to attract more people as it was probably empty most
of the time.
