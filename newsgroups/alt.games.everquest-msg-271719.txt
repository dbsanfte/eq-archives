My wife and I are trying DAoC again with the Catacombs expansion and I just
mentioned to her about the trees. It's the fist game I've seen where a pine
tree *actually* had realistic looking pine cones on it. Unfortunately, for
me, the gameplay hasn't changed much so I don't know how long I'll stay but
it definitely is the prettiest in my opinion.

Usenet is like a herd of performing elephants with diarrhea -- massive,
difficult to redirect, awe-inspiring, entertaining, and a source of
mind-boggling amounts of excrement when you least expect it.
