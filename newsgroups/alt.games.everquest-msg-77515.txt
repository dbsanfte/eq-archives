No, you did fine.  If you'd said you put all the points into AGI and DEX,
I'd say reroll, but as long as you put them into INT and CHA, you're fine,
no matter how you split them.

When I created my enchanter, I dumped as many as I could into INT, and only
5 into CHA.  Right now, with full buffs, I have a 203 INT and a 203 CHA.  I
have a set of INT gear in the bank I use for trade skills, and that gets me
to 255 INT, 149 CHA.

As far as anyone's been able to tell, CHA affects charm resist and duration,
and merchant prices.  That's it.  There have been many many tests on the
effect of CHA on mezzing, but they're inconclusive.  The primary stat for
mezzing seems to be your level vs the mob level.  Mez duration is fixed -
once the mez sticks, it sticks for the full duration of the spell.

On the other hand, INT provides a clear benefit - more mana.  More mana =
more spells.  When things go right, you probably won't need that extra spell
or two, but when things go wrong and you have 5 or 6 pulls to mez, you'll
be glad you have it.

Also, CHA items tend to be a lot cheaper than INT items, and provide a
bigger boost to the stat.  Crude stein (15), Rod of Insidious Glamour (12),
pair of gold cat's eye bracers (7 each).  That's 41 CHA right there, and I
used that setup until level 55.  Other popular items are electrum star ruby
rings (7 cha/5 dex).  I used those, too.  And the CHA buffs you'll get give
you an additional 30, 40 and 50 CHA.  Taken all together and that's a lot of
CHA boosting.

I've found that charm soloing is usually more trouble than it's worth.  You
read all the guides, and they make it sound like the best thing since sliced
bread, but I've never been able to make it work reliably.  I still get more
exp, and faster, in a group.  Charm has a tendency to break at the absolute
worst time.  Maybe with Dictate that'll change, but I can't cast that yet,
so I can't tell you.
