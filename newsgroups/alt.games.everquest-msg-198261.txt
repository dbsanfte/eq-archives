For soloing? Grouping? Pulling? An eye on raiding?

With my rogue i went a different approach on AA's, after spending 3 points
on Run 3, I went straight to PoP advanced.  Imo ferocity is a better deal
than Ambidexterity early on, because a lot of the Arch pre-requisites do
nothing to add to DPS.

My monk did his Arch and Class AA's before PoP, so I got a lot of stuff that
I generally wouldn't have now (or at least in a very different order).

For me the most important monk AA's were Natural Durability, Rapid Feign,
Combat Agility, and Lightening Reflexes 5.

With that in mind, if I were starting my AA's now I'd go

Run 3
Regen or First aid (depends if you want critical mend, I have it and its
decent)
Crits 1 (gotta have some fun)
Combat Agility 3
Rapid Feign
Lightening Reflexes
Natural Durability
Pshyical Enhancement
Ferocity
Wu's

Thats all raid related though (and as you haven't answered my first question
yet I'll assume this isn't what your looking for)

I made the mistake of getting level 1 of most of my Arch abilities, so
getting one maxed required a lot more AA's and time.  And I think level 3 in
<something> is better than 3 level 1's in <stuff>.

Anyway heres my opinion of each of the second tier abilities

Combat Agility : Pre-req for LR5, one of the best abilities
Combat Fury    : Pre-req for fury of the ages.  I have this, and with 2 1h
weapons I crit a LOT... I wouldn't get past level 1 until you have more AA's
than you know what to do.
Combat Stability : Pre-reg for Innate Defence, I was dissapointed with both
of these.
Fear Resistance : Just say no
Finishing Blow  : Waste.. "flash" for 1% of the mobs you will ever hunt in
the right level range
Natural Durability : Any extra HP is good, right?
Natural Healing : Seems expensive to me for a point of regen

So after all that.. for a more general player I'd probably go something like
this
Crits 1
ND3
Ferocity 3
Rapid Feign 3
Wu's

For reference: my monkeys AA's:

And my rogues AA's (been neglected for a while):
