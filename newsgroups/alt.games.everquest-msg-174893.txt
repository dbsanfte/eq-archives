Oh, I'm not disagreeing with any of that.  That's why I added the last
clause "for those nations who care."  Some people are taken with the notion
that, just because some nations behave a ceratin way, all will.  That's as
stupid as those who didn't pull out of the cold war mentality when it's
over.  There are a butt-ton of nations out there, and each one has to be
considered in it's own way, not force fed into a "new warfare" mold.  As
soon as we shift everything over to the new warfare, the old style will
become an option again.
