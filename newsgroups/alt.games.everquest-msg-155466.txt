Left number is the time delay between you and the server... if this is above
500, you may start to experience problems timing some critical spells. When
it hits 1000 I've found it near impossible to chase down fleeing mobs with a
melee character... server thinks you've run past the mob, client thinks
you're still behind it and requests a 'to hit' response, and in the
confusion melee blows simply aren't landing  :o)

Right number is amount of incoming data... try and keep it below 2000 (but
above zero, obviously *grin*) by using every trick you can... /serverfilter,
spell effects off, others misses off, etc
