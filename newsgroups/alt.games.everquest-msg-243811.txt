Another option if you can't find a real artist (I'm just as untalented) is
to just throw something together in PhotoShop. You can pick up any one of a
number of good texts on how to use PhotoShop and with it you can create some
fairly nice sigs just putting various pics together. The one I use is made
up entirely of in-game pics. You can find it if you scroll down this page to
the 7th message:

With PhotoShop you could easily turn your armor white. Given your
resourcefulness, I doubt you'll have any trouble figuring out how to put all
of PhotoShop's incredible tools to use.
