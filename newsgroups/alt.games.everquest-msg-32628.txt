Because abandoning five people to their deaths is not acceptable cleric
behavior.  Ever.

I can work around cleric quirks.  That one doesn't spread out buffs, so
we'll need some downtime every few spawn cycles.  This one hasn't
discovered complete heal yet, so is constantly lom.  That other one has a
shaky connection, we'll need a good backup healer... This stuff I can deal
with.

But the cleric who lets people die because someone pissed in his Cheerios
that morning?  The one who is just plain unreliable?  No way.  He's not
grouping with me, he's not raiding with me, he's not coming anywhere near
me.  I don't even want to be in the same zone, because as a rogue, I'm the
one who gets the tell asking for CR help.

This is absolutely true, it's excellent advice all around.  But it's not an
excuse to be sadistic.  If they're idiots, tell them they're idiots and
that it's time to turn around and head for the zone line.

For now.
