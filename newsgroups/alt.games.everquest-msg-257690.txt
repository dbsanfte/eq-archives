Don't know what was causing it, but I went down to do my normal scouting run
of Chardok B right after the server came up.   In that zone, and to a lesser
extent Chardok A, there was a haze that made it really hard to see anything,
and imposible to tell if a mob was carrying a lightsource.

Seemed to not be a problem so much in other places I went, but there it was
a real issue.
