Verant already knows that 8 spell slots are a limitation. They already
know that of course players would like more spell slots. They already
know that they think for balance issues all players should get are 8
spell slots. Like many other issues, this was probably a concern that
was just replied to on the developers board not that long ago (I bet
you can go there and still find it)

So a petition would be moot. They know that of course players would
want more so even 475,000 people saying they want more than 8 is moot
because verant knows that. Therefore its the same as other "hard no"s
that Verant has had such as no further mana or hp regen, no further
natural run speed, no horses, no mana in a bottle,  etc.. Verant may
change it someday (as they did with all of those things) but they will
when THEY want to since they know that of course players do want those
things. 

It is an interesting difference in that you are suggesting doing it
through the alt experience method. I think the spell slots are locked
into the GUI though so if you'd really like to present that feature
I'd post to the dev board about it NOW before they finalize the new
updated GUI we were supposed to get around the time of Luclin that
they are still working on. Once again a petition on the subject
accomplishes nothing but they DO read things posted to the dev board
even if they don't respond to them.
