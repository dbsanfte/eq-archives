I seldom get a group with my cleric (51) at velks, unless I form one myself
with some other melees who wander in. I guess to get in an existing group
you have to wait for the current cleric to leave, and that might be hours.
On our server (DRo), there are usually spare clerics at Velks (or anywhere
else I go) sitting around LFG.
