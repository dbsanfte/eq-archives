I"m a cleric, specialized in Alteration (like 90% of us) and I certainly
do see a marked effect from specialization.

Its most visible in a res situation, where I'm casting a 700 mana spell.
If I'm OOM (and I often am, when someone is dead) I need to
med up almost two bubbles of mana before I can cast.  On
occaision, this is how much mana the spell requires, but more
often than not, it takes only -half- that much.  Med back up
one bub and do a second res, repeat...when it actually takes
all 700 mana I'm surprised!  The same sort of thing happens
while healing.

On paper, my nukes compete with the DD of a wizard at some
levels, but assuming the same effect happens with your mana
flow, I'm never going to be better than -half- as efficient as
a evoc specialized nuker.
