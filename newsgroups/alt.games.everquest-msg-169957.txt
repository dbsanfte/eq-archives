Sure. That must be the reason why in Texas the state legislates on which 
bodily orifices people are authorized to use for sex in the privacy of 
their own bedroom. And of course, the reason why the present 
conservative government is scrambling to scrap intrusive legislation 
regarding which substances people choose to consume for their own 
entertainment purposes... Oh, wait, it isn't. So much for individual 
freedom, then.

Huh? If he said "the rich", I take it to mean the rich, not the proud. 
If he said wealth, I take it to mean wealth, and not pride. If you think 
that he meant something different from what he said, it's down to you to 
make a convincing case. So far, I'm not convinced you can have your cake 
and eat it too.
