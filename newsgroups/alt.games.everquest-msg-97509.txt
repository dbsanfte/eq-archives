Sorry if this has been posted already (my news-server SUCKS!  I often see
're:'s and no initial post, but that's another story) but I read that
food/drink usage was rather high on the test server.  Last night I noticed
considerably high usage of both.
I loaded up a full stack of water and iron rations in FV, ran straight to OT
without stopping to fight or pick daisies, got a group right off, and one
person in the group asked for food and water.  What the Hell?  I thought, I
have full stacks.  Open inventory and had only 15 iron rations and 18
waters.  WTF?!?!?!  That's not accellerated usage, that's ridiculous!
I hope this is a bug.  As I stated, I read this was happening on the test
server, but didn't know it was affecting others as well.

/rant off,
Sean...
