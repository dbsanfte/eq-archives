I'm guessing it's because the port is being done by a third party
(http://www.westlakeinteractive.com is the development house in question
- they're pretty competent), and that would bring up all sorts of "how
do we keep the two clients in sync patch-wise" issues. Certainly the
easiest way around that is a specific server for the Mac version. It's a
mixed blessing - one advantage is that Mac players will most likely have
advance notice of all nerfs (and anti-nerfs), if they or pay attention
to the relevant websites.

Cheers,
Jock
