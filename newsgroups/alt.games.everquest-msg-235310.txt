Well, seeing as my system is almost as craptacular, and I'm still able
to play*, the best advice I coudl give would be to head over to
voodoofiles.com and get the most recent driver for the Banshee.  I'm
running a Voodoo 4 and the game is playable.

*But here's the thing, as soon as the new dx9 engine is released (and
we're told its in the "next couple months" stage), you likely won't be
able to play without the aforementioned upgrade.  I'm aware of this,
and will make the upgrade *when I have to*.  But until then I'll keep
trucking with what I have.
