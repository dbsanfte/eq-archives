A few of us from our very _non_ uber alliance of smaller guilds have
been invited to go on a Hate raid next week with friends in a bigger
guild. I know this has been discussed here before, but I'm
understandably nervous. I realize in advance that planes raid knowledge
isn't generally "published" and is more handed down by experience, but
any tips would be appreciated. I plan on spending some time there in the
future if only for the armor that drops. 
  Of course, the first advice I'd give myself is "keep your mouth shut,
your ears open, and follow what the raid leader says."  But, anything
else good to look out for? Preparations? What sort of resist gear is
best for this? I'm gathering a selection of decent stuff, but I'd like
to equip the best choices to maximize my chances against whatever mobs
I'll be encountering.
