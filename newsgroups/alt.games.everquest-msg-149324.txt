I've always found "Pally" extremely irritating.  If for some reason I
feel obligated to continue a conversation with somebody who insists
on using it I just take a stiff and formal tone (think of the bad
actor who played the first officer on the first of the awful Star
Wreck spinoffs, you know, the guy who always moved and spoke as if
he had a broomstick rammed up his ass) and use "Paladin" at least
once per sentence.
