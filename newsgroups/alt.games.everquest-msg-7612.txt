This shows nothing even regarding military pilots of WWII at least not that
I could find as I skimmed through it. Please point out.

An interview with some guy that wrote a book on the Gulf War who's using "Q:
And, the problem particularly with the night flyers and the pills.....?
Atkinson: Well, American military pilots since World War II had occasionally
used amphetamines as a way to stay awake" in a passing sentence to support
his claim on another subject."

Fistly...he says OCCASIONALLY, this is far from MAJORITY, secondly he
doesn't support this claim at all. I can post several hundred articles
listing how amphetamines or "courage pills" were given to infantry...yet for
some reason I cannot seem to find ONE article that deals expressly with
American WWII pilots using them. It seems as if it would be common sense
that they would if others were using them, but the fact is that they weren't
and some are extremely adamant about the fact that they are being accused of
doing so. I suggest before you start strutting around posting one liners
from someone that was a former staff writer for a publication that is WELL
known for embelishment to the point of lunacy (how this moron got a Pulitzer
I'll never know...his books read more like fiction than fact) I suggest you
check your facts first.

I'm done commenting on this any further...it's offtopic and if you'd like to
continue I'd be happy to send you my findings via email. You've gotten away
from the point anyways where I had stated that Avenger was full of shit
because he claimed that the "majority" of American WWII pilots were
"junkies." It's beginning to look as if you're siding with him. Gotta love
the people in this country who can manage to take and twist a piece of
information to the point that they can point to a whole military branch and
call them drug addicts.
