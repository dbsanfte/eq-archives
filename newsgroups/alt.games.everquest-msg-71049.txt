I don't think a free month is a bad idea, and I've a sneaking
suspicion their bottom line could handle a free month for the small
group of players this affected, but they're not just a small company
any more - I seriously doubt that Sony as a corporation would be able
to grasp the concept.

It would be easy to fake, allowing unscrupulous players to illegally
get a free month.

It still leaves people who don't have the CD or case (which I'd bet is
the majority of them) high and dry.
