The last round of hotzones did have some new augments.  Off the top of
my head, Dranik's Scar had an augment (10 Str, 30 HP, +10 SvCold),
Acrylia Caverns had (10 AC, 40 HP, Regen 1) and Wall of Slaughter had
(40 HP, +5 all saves).  These are different from the "unmasked
changeling" augments that were introduced in the round of hotzones
before these, although they are still zonewide rarely-dropped No Drop
augments.
