 C:\Windows\ System32\Shutdown.exe. I would have assumed an ap or a driver
wouldn't have the power to do this OS task but I am not a pc guru or i might
be a happy and well-paid individual rather than a shift working drone in a
call center. I know when i studied unix a decade ago that an app wasn't
supposed to have the 'right' to do this but heck, windows isn't very big on
rights, and i migh be wrong about on that anyhoo.

By the way installing directx9.0c did solve the shutdown problem, although i
now have landscape occassionally disappear, which is weird but i can still
play at least, and the shadows were amusing for a few minutes, especially
when they go through walls so you can see what's on the other side
(potential exploit?), and the water effect is delicious.

Doing a search on "windows xp shutdown" on google lead me to fifty gazillion
sites on problems people had with windows either not shutting down or
shutting down and rebooting, but i can't find a site where someone describes
a problem where the pc actually turns off if certain graphical options are
used. My only clues was that everything worked fine when i hadn't used
omens, and someone else with an ATI card had exactly the same problem after
installing omens. It's a good thing that Airguitar spotted that dxdiag was
reporting directx had apparently reverted back to version 5. I can't
understand how ... i thought xp started with version 8, and this is a clean
install and i have installed ldon which i thought checked if you had 9.0b
anyway... but it works and i'm willing to blame gremlins or microsoft or
sony for doing weird things to me.

You are right, wasn't that melissa? Can't recall. It was causing a reboot
rather than a shutdown though, and rebooting ad infinitum seems incredibly
common.   "Microsoft Knowledge Base Article - 308029
Resources to help troubleshoot shutdown problems in Windows XP" only
mentions problems where you can't shutdown the computer, or where the
computer restarts, but as far as i can tell, there's nothing in the MSKB
about having the pc just shutdown and stay off, and i had no reports of
device conflicts in device manager and my temperature was being reported by
bios as normal. SFC reported no problems.
