Well, the thing is that your level 32 manasong doesn't really twist
well.  It only gives mana when it pulses.  You can twist it with one
other song with no loss of effeciency, but you have to explain that to
your groupmates.  If you're doing instruments you can use your 34
catata and that lasts for a full three pulses, so a 3 song twist is
fully effective there.  It gets really nice at 55 when the updated
Catata lasts for 3 full pulses, does as much mana as C2, and heals on
top of it.  At that point a 3 or even 4 song twist is appropriate.
Just inform your casters of what you're doing, and they'll generally
get in line.  Of course you'll have to point the stubborn ones to
www.eqsongs.com to have them check it themselves.

Group clarity song?  I know I alwasy get C2 on raids, just because
it's a lot more mana effecient to cast group C2.

Can't you outrun them with SoW?  If you really need to be able to run
away, keep selos loaded, and when you start running click sow off as
you start selos.  The best of both worlds.
