As you zone into bazaar from the Nexus, you pass a bank on your left,
and then see the merchant building on your left.  Go inside and he's the
first merchant on the left hand side. He's got bat wings and most other
common reagents.

Across from him is the guy whos sells the trader satchels if you never
picked any up for your bank. (Ten slot container, holds GIANT size
items, and costs like two plat or something rediculously cheap.

Pity they weigh so much.
