Yup that's exactly the case I'm making. If you can't see it: We're done 
  until you do. You clearly have zero conception of how games work.

I have a copy of LotR on my shelves. Yes, that book exists in this 
universe, Middle Earth however is not an extension of my living room.

Like I said. You clearly have zero understanding of what a game world is 
then, if you think its a hard drive and some processors.

No, I am quite accustomed to computers and hard drives. Norrath is 
neither, no more than Middle Earth is a stack of paper. Middle Earth, 
and Norrath are living breathing worlds with forests, monsters, oceans, 
history, lore, and culture.

Not in the least. Your credit card never goes anywhere near it.

Strictly speaking. Yes.

That said, most people play their gaggle of characters as a unified 
entity, ultimately all the characters are of one mind and act in 
concert. That is simply the reality of having multiple characters played 
by a single player -- in any game.

I know exactly what it is. And it makes as much sense as Gandalf riding 
into battle in a Battletech Battlemaster. Just because the technology 
exists to allow you to do it doesn't mean it makes any sense. If I play 
DAoC for a year and amass a grand fortune, should I be able to use that 
to equip myself in EQ and WoW and Diablo?

So? EQ is set in a singular universe. Each character's story has a 
definate beginning middle and ending.

So buying the D&D manuals is the same as transferring items to the 
characters in an ongoing campaign? See, now its a 'universe' just like 
eq... and all I've done is bought the monster manual, that's has next to 
nothing to do with transferring itmes to characters inside the campaign.

And playing EQ is making your own story. That is the traditional 
definition of an RPG. And having your characters get instantly wealthy 
for no reason other than you felt like it amounts to a deus ex machina.
