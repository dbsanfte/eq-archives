By all means. The question is... is feeding into a truck size-and-power 
arms race with every other road user making your family safer in the 
long run? Right now, maybe you can keep ahead of the curve, but perhaps 
some day you'll find you have the smallest truck around and you are 
surrounded by supertanker-sized monstrosities on all sides. One SUV *may* 
be making your family safer, but no SUVs would be making *all* families 
safer, including yours.
