    Well, the jury should still be out. The hard-level adventures and the
raids still need to be fully explored. But from what I've seen and heard so
far, it's certainly shaping out that way.

    The loot available is excellent for the effort required. And the cash
loots are wonderful. It's like Sebilis was when I first stepped into it
years ago, filled to the top with useful items for my twinks and cash drops
for me.

    They also made good choices balancing the dungeons. No real required
classes in LDoN, at least not at the level 65 stage. Have no standard cc
types, but have a necromancer? Do Deeper Guk, or Mistmoore. Have a magician
instead of the necromancer? Go to Takish-Hiz, an almost all summoned-mob
dungeon. Don't have a tracker to find the boss you're supposed to kill /
person you're supposed to rescue? Just get close to them, and they'll start
calling out and leading you to them. At the same time that they're lenient
with respect to class balance, they're tough because of the time limits. You
can't fart around, and that adds excitement to them.

Outstanding

    I had one new model complaint - the female sand elves look like they're
too weak to hold their weapons because of their limp-wristed swing. That's
it. Everything else looks either OK to exceptional (fully cloaked vampire
model in MM, air elemental model in Tak, evil eye model and ghost frog model
in Guk). Even some of the reused models were good choices, as they were
things that the average EQ player might never have seen. When I say that I'm
thinking about the red devourer models, holgresh models, and demon models in
Miragul's.

    Well, it could take that long just to get enough points to buy some of
the good stuff! ;-)
