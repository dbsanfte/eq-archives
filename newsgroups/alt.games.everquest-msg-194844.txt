  when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself =
on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-----

  2Sam.15
  [1] And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots =
and horses, and fifty men to run before him.


  [2] And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: =
and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king =
for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art =
thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.


  [3] And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; =
but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.


  [4] Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that =
every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would =
do him justice!


  [5] And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him =
obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.


  [6] And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king =
for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.


  [7] And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the =
king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the =
LORD, in Hebron.


  [8] For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, =
saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I =
will serve the LORD.


  [9] And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to =
Hebron.


  [10] But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, =
saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, =
Absalom reigneth in Hebron.


  [11] And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were =
called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.


  [12] And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counseller, =
from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the =
conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with =
Absalom.


  [13] And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the =
men of Israel are after Absalom.


  [14] And David said unto all his servants that were with him at =
Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from =
Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring =
evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.


  [15] And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants =
are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.


  [16] And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the =
king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.


  [17] And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and =
tarried in a place that was far off.


  [18] And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the =
Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred =
men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.


  [19] Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou =
also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art =
a stranger, and also an exile.


  [20] Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go =
up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take =
back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.


  [21] And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as =
my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, =
whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.


  [22] And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite =
passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with =
him.


  [23] And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people =
passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all =
the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.


  [24] And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the =
ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and =
Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.


  [25] And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the =
city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me =
again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:


  [26] But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, =
let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.


  [27] The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? =
return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy =
son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.


  [28] See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there =
come word from you to certify me.


  [29] Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to =
Jerusalem: and they tarried there.


  [30] And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he =
went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the =
people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, =
weeping as they went up.


  [31] And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators =
with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of =
Ahithophel into foolishness.


  [32] And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the =
mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet =
him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:


  [33] Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt =
be a burden unto me:


  [34] But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be =
thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so =
will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the =
counsel of Ahithophel.


  [35] And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? =
therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the =
king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.




  Jees - & to think we are sharing the planet with plonklers that think =
up & write crap like this.
