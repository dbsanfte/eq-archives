Head has always been a problem area for warriors. The SSB is just so
underpriced, you get it early, and figure you need an upgrade, where in
fact, it's still a great helm at your level.

For a few k, you should be able to pick up a Heavy Dragonskull Helm
(+17 AC +6 Sta +10 Int) or any of the dragon helms from western wastes.
Though not common, you sometimes see them sold in ECO on mature servers.
Other than SSB -- Indico -- Cobalt -- Warlords -- Hobart route,
dragonhide armour is about the only warrior head option that isn't an
ubermob drop (well, Hobart is hehe)

Stick with the SSB for now, your plat can probably be spent better
elsewhere.

If you're giant factioned, you are of a level to be able to do the
Collar of the Storm Kael quest (+11 AC +6 Strength +7 Stamina +7 Magic
Resist +13 Cold Resist +15 Hit Points) which is pretty damn nice, and
should see you to ToV at 60ish. Otherwise, Rygorr is about the best you
can get. Spider fur is nice, but probably not worth paying for if you
already have Rygorr, since the 24hps are probably better than 1 ac, and
the magic resists more general purpose than higher dis/pois resists
