: New melee skills are accessed through a new window (ALT+C if it's not

: those skills. :-)
The new DISCIPLINES are available in the Alt+C window (after being purchased
and learned at guild master).   The upgrade announcement seemed to indicate
that there were new disciplines and new skills (different things in my
mind).


: The mitigation boost is simply a ~4.5% raise in mitigation for all
