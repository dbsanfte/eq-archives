/em stares at %t in disbelief....

Did I miss it, or did you just try to use Occam's Razor as proof that the
soul doesn't exist?  It's not a scientific postulate, but a philosophy.  Or,
has it been scientifically proven that the simplest explanation is the
correct one.  This may explain some of the failings of science, people who
rely on that postulate refuse to accept that things are more complex than
they may seem.  Actually, if fits perfectly....

In other words, since it would be more difficult to prove the existance of a
soul, than to disprove it, we must go the way of proving it?  The more I
hear of this, the more convinced I am that science is willingly blinding
itself.  It's not willing to say "we don't know," so it assumes things that
fit the mindset, and then bases further research on those assumptions.  Not
very scientific, if you ask me.

Sounds like you're just trying to stack the deck in your favor.  In the end,
there is nothing to suggest that the soul doesn't exist, yet you are more
than happy to proclaim that.  It all comes down to a matter of religion.
Mine is based on belief, yours is based on disbelief... the atheist is just
as religous as the christian.  Only the agnostic can claim to have no
religion.
