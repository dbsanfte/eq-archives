All the grouping ive done in WoW has been for particular quests. I tend to 
take all the quests I can get in an area, and solo as many as I can. Some 
are too tough, I leave those and mvoe onto something else. When I hear 
someone asking for people to help with that quest, I join up, do the quest 
with them, and then sually go on my way again.

Some people you can click with, so you ad them to friends and team up for 
future quests.

I have never seen a group formed to grind xp. You can solo very effectively 
with just about any class tho, so it doesnt matter. Quest is faster xp tho, 
if you dont get bogged down on it, since youre geting xp from the monsters 
and the questgiver (questreceiver actually).
