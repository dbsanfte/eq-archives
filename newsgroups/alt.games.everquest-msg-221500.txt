    The modern drops available in the Bazaar are remarkable. And the prices
are nothing short of amazing. 2 K for a 13/20 1HS with good stats? 13/21
piercers with great stats and 10 ATK for 2 K? That's crazy!

    Kylong Darkmail is great stuff. I'm jealous of your mask - I can never
catch one for sale for my wee people. At least I can sell the rogue's
current mask (Rotting Eye) for more than the 8 K I paid when I finally do
find a Kylong, though.

    No STA from AA's. It may seem smart now, but it will haunt you when you
move on and get better gear that puts you at STA cap (and that day will
happen). Get your tanking AA's instead, as they'll likely save you more HPs
than the STA would add anyways. After that, look into what AA's help your
class the most, get something "cool" like Unholy Steed, or start on your DPS
AA's (combat fury, 2 handed bash, etc.) You're a hybrid, so you have a ton
of AA's to get that can be useful.

    Don't do STA. Really, you'll regret it.

    If you don't like tradeskills, I wouldn't recommend it. If you do, go
for it. I find people that don't like tradeskills really have a tough time
of the shawl and tend to burn out on the game while doing it.

    Actually, I was going to suggest an ornate helm. The helms are usually
the cheapest Ornate piece available in The Bazaar, and the effect
(Plainsight, UV/See Invis) means not relying on buffs like Pact of Hate to
be able to see. The stats are good, too - AC: 28 STR: +4 DEX: +2 STA: +5
INT: +6 AGI: +3 HP: +50 MANA: +40 SV FIRE: +6 SV COLD: +4 SV POISON: +5.
Arms might be a good investment if you can find them for cheap, too, as the
regen effect helps mitigate against Pact of Hate (and the stats are nice).
Other than that, though, just keep doing what you're doing now - that's a
very nice character! :-)
