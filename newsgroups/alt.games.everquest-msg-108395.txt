The way I see it...  Is that you are neglecting the reasons for wanting the
port for both issues.  In South Karana...  People who are at the Paw
Spires, tend to be loaded down with coin and FS weapons...  A run through
South and North Karana with that stuff, to squeeze the some plat to fund
their own existance, is hard to do, even with SoW.  (And mind you, this
comes from a person who has done it with a Cleric AND a Druid.)  As for
Lavastorm...  Yes, some of the stuff the guy may be carrying can be sold to
Tisana, but then again, a decent amount of stuff is easier sold in ECommons
for much more and going across Nektulos is no spring stroll sometimes,
especially loaded.

The other thing is... Some people ask for ports because it is more convient
than running through several zones, mostly due to worrying about camo
dropping at the worse possible second in an unfriendly zone that hardly has
people to help out if you need it.  Remember, Nektulos is not Ecommons or
WC where there are frequently high levels running through there.  Also,
Camo is not the best invis spell to rely on, especially if you haven't
worked on your Divination skills in a while.

While it is not uncommon for a mage or enchanter or so on to run across one
continent to another, there are some reasons why some people won't run.
And mind you... I have poked fun at people asking for a port that is one
zone away too.
