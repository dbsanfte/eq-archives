Well, let's see.  In the case of the guild I was referring to, we had
a group of associates who agreed that they were gonna make a guild
first, which meant we hadto choose the guildleader second.  IMO, the
lady we chose did the right thing by going forward with guild creation
rather than dawdling until there was a unanimous agreement on a name.
We weren't getting the job done "in committee", so she acted as a
leader should and got the situation resolved.  The mistake she made
was in getting into a flame-war with the woman who thought we ought
to just sit on our hands until <everybody> was in agreement, when she
should have simply pointed out that she did what needed doing, no more
and no less.

Now, the guild I am in now has had a number of leaders, and the most
recent leadership change (happened just before I joined) was triggered
by a revolt among the guild membership against the leadership of the
then leader (who is still a member of the guild, I believe).  This is
a family-style guild, guild-sponsored raids are very rare, and it
seems to very much go on the "consent of the governed" concept, tho
the officers council pretty much runs things under the direction of
the guild leader, with the rank and file consulted only occasionally
on possibly contentious "policy" issues.

We don't have much rabble, the rabble generally leaves for other
guilds after a bit of ranting.  Some good folks leave also, for
various reasons.  Like most any "family" there are tensions and
arguments among us, it can get "interesting" when a couple of the
old-timers lose patience with one another.

Not much different from the "crowds" and "cliques" of most any large
high school.  In fact, I'll be so bold as to say that the biggest
difference is the inclusion of so many middle school kids in the
mix, plus the anonymity afforded to all those twenty-somethings who
should never have been promoted out of middle school, that things
often tend to be even less "mature" than your typical high school.
