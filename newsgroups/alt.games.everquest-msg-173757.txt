As a 65 cleric with all but two spells up to 59 (RC, RGC... NOT cleric duties),
several 60 spells, all 61 and 62 spells, and a third of my 63, 64, and 65
spells, I'm far far far from caring about this, PLENTY of room for more spells.
I even maintain empty pages in between my useful spell section and my "I'll
never ever cast this again" spell section.

I have threatened from time to time to delete BOA, but not for space
considerations.
