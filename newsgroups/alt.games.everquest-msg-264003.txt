No, your attempt to play the same desperate semantic games that 42 did
only proves I'm right.

No, insults were being traded before I joined the thread.  Julie
insulted Annie.  42 insulted Julie.  I insulted 42.  He insulted me back.
It's only when I repeated my insult you actually noticed it.  You didn't
notice my insult the first time I made it, you said I was "doing ok"
up until my second post.  You also said I made an accusation that I did
not make.  You're clearly not paying attention.

And I never lost my "cool".  When I insult someone I do so delibrately.
Just as deliberately as you're insulting me, even if your holier-than-thou
attitude won't let you admit that.

Because he sprang into into existance about a year and half ago posting
as if Usenet wasn't exactly new to him.  Hmm... I suspect that he briefly
called himself "DB" before that.

You can often learn something about someone by the tattoos they choose
to wear.

I'm sure you've made your mind about me.

>Like I said, who the hell is Ross Ridge?

No one you know.  But someone a lot of people do know.  However no one
knows "42", it's just a disposable identity some anomymous poster made up.

Yes, I think most people wouldn't consider someone who chose a rude name
like that as being very credible.
