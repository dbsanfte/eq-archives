I don't get it. You asked where you might read more about the product, 
and he told you. He recommended Google with a quick plug in case you 
weren't already familiar with it. There are a lot of different levels of 
knowledge here and no reason to make too many assumptions when you can 
simply and briefly accommodate everyone at once.

Whereas your preference may have been for the poster to answer your 
questions here, I didn't see their response as insulting at all.
