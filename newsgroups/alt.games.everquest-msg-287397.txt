Actually, I was there when WoW launched, and I found it similar (but
not quite as bad) to the SWG launch, in that, while there may not have
been a vast *number* of bugs (though they both had their share), the
bugs that did exist were pretty close to show-stoppers. In SWG there
was the disappearing bank/inventory items and server crashes. In WoW
there was the nasty, and I do mean *nasty*, lag spikes (can you say
stuck loot window?) and general server instability. I've seen bugs
that affected certain aspects of EQ (bugged quests, spells that didn't
work, etc.), but I can't recall any that just made me want to not play
until they were fixed.
