    Bet it was my fault. It usually is, being the cleric and all. :-) Second
page of "The Arena" on Steel Warrior (or at least it was this morning),
thread on whether monks or warriors are better for XP groups, second page of
that thread. It's quite a long log.

    According to the person that actually parsed it, it came out to 5600
DPS, over a 31 second time frame.

    Chunks has an Earthshaker, lame two hander that procs Earthquake (250ish
DD PBAoE). He also has the Rampage alt XP ability that lets him swing a
whole bunch of times every so often, and he gets buffed with Primal Avatar
to make sure the thing procs. He runs off, gets 10ish mobs, brings them back
where the two enchanters start chain-stunning and I CE/CH him (last night he
would have been somewhere between 6500 and 7000 HPs, and he'd get dropped to
as low as two bubs pulling). He then runs off and gets more. After three or
four such trips, someone will say "Nuke?" as they get nervous and we all cut
loose.

    What he wanted to show by posting the log was that a warrior had a place
in an AoE group. And it's true - with Dachunker in our group we are as safe
as can be. He can kill the stragglers after the bulk of the mobs are dead
just like in a normal group, he can AoE taunt so stuff doesn't always attack
the enchanters, he can defend a bunch of OOM casters from the one wanderer
that would otherwise wreck us, and as you can see his damage contribution is
significant. And nobody can pull hordes of mobs, some of which nuke and some
of which HT, like he can with those massive HPs of his.

Here's the link again, it wraps, yadda yadda yadda.
