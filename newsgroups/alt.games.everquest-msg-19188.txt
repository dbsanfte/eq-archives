    I believe this just as much as you do. But I do have one question for
the "AC is king" camp....

    OK. So you've made the assumption with the Jagged Band comment that over
time, with a CHealing cleric (since the pally is level 42), that 5 raw AC (8
net AC) will allow the cleric to be more mana efficient in healing the
paladin than 65 extra HPs would. Or, to break it down even further, that a
1-2% increase in AC will offset a 4-5% loss in HPs (assuming average 42
PAL). Are there any logs that show exactly what sort of AC gain to HP loss
ratio is efficiency neutral? Or, to ask more straightforward questions:

    Losing 1 AC for 0 HP is inefficient. Losing 1 AC for 500 HPs is likely
efficient. Somewhere between is the break-even point. Matt, where would YOU
put the break-even point? How many HPs should an item add per point of raw
AC lost? Is this linear, eg. one AC loss requires X HPs gained, but two AC
losses requires 2.2X HPs gained? And most importantly, HOW did you arrive at
your conclusion?
