Damn, shut off your music.  It's a resource hog you don't need... do you?
Just play the music in your head or something man... ;)

I have never even heard the music.  The first think I change in options for
ANY game I play is "Ingame Music Volume: 0%"  Damn right.. don't bog down my
system with your crappy midi or wav or whatever you use. ;)
