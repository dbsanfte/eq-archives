They are exceedingly rare. They seem to travel across the top of the surface
on the NE to SE side. They look like a reddish rhino beetle, not like the
stonebinders in the tunnels with the aliens. They are underconned and fight
pretty hard for a lowbie quest item.

A friend told me that they can be found anywhere on the east side of the
mountain range, but tend to travel east of the road to Shar Vahl the most.

G'luck
