It pisses me off that I had to return from my newsgroup vacation for
this. Here is a message I posted to my tailoring guide today...


10/31 - Important Message - Please Read

Recently, several eBay customers reported to me that an eBay seller
was offering for sale a document entitled "EVERQUEST GRANDMASTER
TAILOR FAST & EASY", which contained the following claim: "This work
is copywrited [sic] by H&H Productions 2002, it is an original
compilation of data, facts and techniques that we have found or
developed over the last 2 years."

I have a copy of the document they are selling and have looked it over
carefully. With the exception of a few editorial comments, NONE of the
material in it is original. Fully half of it was copied, verbatim,
without any editing, from Lokari's Tailoring Guide. The balance was
copied directly from EQ Traders. When I contacted H&H about this, they
replied with the outrageous and false claim that they "did not use a
wholesale copy and paste". They did not offer even so much as an
apology for their theft.

I have notified eBay of the violation, and also forwarded all relevant
material to the Den Mother over at EQ Traders. Should you care to
weigh in on the matter, here is contact information for the guilty
parties (why yes, I am very irritated):
