}Faith is rendered irrelevant by proof.  It's pointless to trust after

Luckily, in life outside mathematics, we almost never have proof.  We have 
'a preponderance of evidence', 'proof beyond a reasonable doubt', 'proof 
beyond even a bunch of unreasonable doubts', but rarely, if ever, actual, 
complete, indisputable, unarguable proof.  So you're always quite free to 
keep faith that something is true, even if it's pretty much a sure thing.
