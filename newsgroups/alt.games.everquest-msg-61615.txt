    Assuming faction is good on both chars, yes, you can do this just fine.
That NPC sometimes walks to his room, so you may get a little scare when you
log in the dwarf and he's not where you left him, but otherwise your plan
will work if faction is OK. To test faction on the gnome, have the gnome ask
Byzar "What Corflunk?" Be sure you spell Corflunk's name right. If Byzar
tells the gnome about the quest, you're good to go! If he doesn't, the gnome
may have to do some faction work killing Crushbone Orcs, Butcherblock
bandits, etc.
