First off EQ is NOTHING like Diablo. It takes a *huge* time investment
to gain levels and equipment. Don't expect to be level 60 or have all
of the fancy gear and equipment you see other people using in a
week....a month....or even a year. EQ is a "long haul" game. You build
your character(s) over time. As they level up they will gain new
skills and new powers.

Many have described EQ as a chat room with nice graphics. This isn't
too far from the truth. The adventures you have in EQ at level 1 or
level 60 will be much more fun if you are sharing them with other
people. 

The best advice I could give you is this....

Sit back relax and find the part of the game that you personally enjoy
they most. You can never "win" at EQ. There is no prize for reaching
level 60 or having the best gear in the game. The closest you can come
to winning is playing the way YOU want to play, and hanging out with
people that share your same EQ-goals.

Enjoy and welcome!!!
