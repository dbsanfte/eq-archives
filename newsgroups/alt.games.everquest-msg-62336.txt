That's the rub.  Some stuff is "born" seeing invisible. Hide may or may
not work on them.  Kobolds in Sol B do NOT see through invis by
default, but many of 'em have a friendly neighborhood shaman come
by and cast See Invisible on them.  That spell sees through everything.

If you're lucky and can stay out of the front arc you can still sneak,
however, but even monks can do that.

It's just like the frogs in Guk.  None of 'em are spawned seeing
invisible except some of the named (frenzied, assassin, etc), but many
times if you happen to be near, for instance, an Urd Ghoul Wizard
you'll see one of his buffs being See Invisible.  And he'll cast it
on all his friends nearby, too.
