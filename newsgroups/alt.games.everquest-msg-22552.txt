I've been reading this newsgroup since before EverQuest went into
beta. I've seen all of the regulars at their worst. I've never had a
discussion with Bizbee, but he has always seemed to me like a lonely
man whose sole joy in life is to act cocky on usenet. I've always
wrote him off as a gutless keyboard cowboy. As such, he fits in with
some of the other regulars. I guess that's why he's still around.
