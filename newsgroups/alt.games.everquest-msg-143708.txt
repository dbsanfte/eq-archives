Hi

I live in the UK and am about to join everyone else in the world of EQ. What
I aim to do is to create a Newbie guild for those of us (newbies) that live
in the UK so we can learn and grow together and hopefully (fingers crosses
and various guides seriously thumbed later) we will have a good strongly
bonded guild. Idealy Im looking for more mature players (Im 33 yikes) so
anyone thats not a baby would be welcome. If you're interested then reply or
email me at the following. Please note the following is to stop email
collection software spamming my email account.
