Yeah, I had to do:

/shout Beggars like %t have ruined their own land,
/pause 10
/shout they'll not ruin mine!
/d

Doesn't come off quite as well, but I think the point is made.  I'm playing
around with it (when I remember) to use different % codes for the other
pronouns, to take the place of "their" and "they'll"...I just have to
remember to look in the docs to see which is which. :)
