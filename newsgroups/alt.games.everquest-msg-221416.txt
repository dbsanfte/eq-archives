The track step was entirely unneccessary.  If Wuoshi is up, he's
near the portal, and if you ported in, you did so well within his
attack range.  You'd be dead well before you managed to hit the
track button.  Early on in the release of Velious this was known
as the "suicide port" because nobody (except a very rare Veeshan
worshipping bard) was non KOS to the COV faction yet, and nobody
was killing Wuoshi yet.  Recovering the bodies usually took
multiple additional deaths.
