Just a simple way to say thank you everyone for all the help I have received
from this board and on The Nameless server I play on.

Story #1
Last week I took my Froglok Pal to lvl 5.  YAY!!! Now I can use some more
magic!  I buy all the spells I can use at this level and run back to the
Swamp to play.  As I am loading my spells and Buffing myself witht he ones I
have I pick the wrong buff.  I hit Flash of Light.  Very interesting to say
the least, long and boaring to say the most.  I say there, looking at a
swamp, BAM a white screen for about a sec, and 5 minutes of black screen
waiting for the spell to wear-off.  I wasn't in a battle so I didn't get
attacked, (prob because all the Skelies and Zombies were laughing too hard
to attack me, and the Snakes and Spiders were afraid because if I would do
something like that to myself who knows what I would do to them).

Story #2
Last night I am playing with my Froglok Cler lvl 7 and I gate him back to
the Swamp.  I am finding a bunch of stuff that is blue so I am having a good
time.  I decide I would like to make my way to S. Ro.  I never did go that
far with my Pal and now that he stays where he dies I like to know the area
better before I play someplace new.  I find a bunch of Burly Kurbos
(whatever their names are), and do quite well.  Spells with a Cle are much
better than with my Pal at this level.  I get to the enterance and find a
Froglok that is trying to get home.  I can not remember the quest, but I
know I am suppose to help him.  I get FOM and we are off.  Since I do not
know the area that well and I came up the round about way I opened my map to
get some guideance.  I have the faded level set at 20 so I can see ok thru
it when my cusor is not on the map.  I guess ok and night time in a swamp
are 2 things that do not go together.  I tried to swim under some roots of a
tree but they were too close to the ground so I stopped.  Nor problem, I
will just back-up and swim around.  I can not.  After hitting F9 what seemed
about a hundered times I get an angle that shows this stupid Frog I am
helping right behind me.  I am pinned against a tree by my own race.  I
jump, turn, duck, you name it I can not move.  I see a Troll or Ogar or
whatever spawns/lives around there.  I am not too worried, he can not get to
me.  After he leaves, (I think), I decide the only way out of this is to
attack my lost Frog friend.  I click on him, he is blue.  I hit attack and
he moves just enough to allow that stupid Troll to come around the tree and
start hitting me.  I can not turn enough to click on him, I can not move
enough to click on me.  All that is happening is I am against a tree, a
tired, (and stupid) Frog has me pinned against it, a Troll thing is swinging
at me, I want to go forward to attack it and this stupid frog is pushing
back under a tree!  (I am sure it is screeming "Let me in!  Let me in!" and
I am screaming "Let me out! Get outta da way and let me out!)

I hope you enjoyed my 2 little stories of a newbie.  I hope it made you
laugh.  If it did, I hope it was enough for all the help everyone here has
given me.
