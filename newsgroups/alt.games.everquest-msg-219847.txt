Tatical Mastery(AA skill) can let warrior have CHANCE to hit even when your
attack is being ripsote.
DS help even if you can't hit the mob yourself... when they riposte and hit
you they take the DS dmg everytime. so even when you can't hit the mob
everytime you swing your weapon the mob is taking damage.
