Not only that, but I offer you MORE!

L60 Ogre warrior. Some of the best gear in the game. Hategiver, Jaelens,
Braided Strands, Primal Warsword are just some of my weapons. 7k+ hps
fully buffed. Lots of AA points.

And there's even more!

Trusted MT of my server's uberguild. Vex Thal Key half complete. Emporer
key complete. Plenty of components for Serubane weapons. All tradeskills
100+ including 215 smithing. 

But I'm not finished yet!

Not only will you 'own' this account, but I will continue to play it for
you! Yup, it's true! I will continue to put the time into this
character, improving equipment all the time, getting more AA skills, and
moving further forward in the game!

Included on the account are several guild mules containing an assortment
of rare and expensive items totalling well over 1 million pp worth on
the open market!

Impress your friends by 'owning' one of the top warriors in EQ, for the
low low price for $500/month recurring fee to cover the time I spend
playing EQ!

*** STOP PRESS ****
Increase to the 'Delux Offer' and for $1500/month I will quit my job and
play more EQ, making your purchase EVER BETTER!!!! More armor! More
weapons! More AA points! Unresistable offer! BUY NOW!
*** STOP PRESS ****

(for obvious reasons to protect your investment, it's safer for the
character if only I drive him, since I am more experienced than you, and
will improve and look after the characters better. For your own good,
you won't be getting the login/pass, station names, or any other account
info. But you can still 'own' the account, and tell everyone about it,
for as long as the monthly payments keep flowing)

Email me at oneborneveryminute@station.sony.com including this post in
it's entirety, as well as login/pass for any existing EQ accounts you
own, and anyone offering to sell you their time (for market research and
statistical purposes)
