I use this when 2 boxing my cleric/druid on raids with more then one group,
especially kael.  For fun, when mob is about 15%, I cast Atone to wipe it's
memory, then cast a nuke from both my characters, doing about 1200 total
damage and our group (which works well when you arent in the main group
getting exp all the time) gets the exp =P
