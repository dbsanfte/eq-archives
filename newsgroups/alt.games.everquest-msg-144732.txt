Yeah, where did all that come from anyway? I'm not the biggest fan of 
the Bush family, but I fully supported the original Gulf War, and the 
war in Afghanistan... But this? Where did attacking Iraq now come from, 
especially after nobody could find any links between Iraq and 9/11?

I have the feeling that if the US attacks another islamic country so 
soon, president Musharraf of Pakistan will probably fall, and then 
things will *really* get ugly.
