The carapace in LGuk drops off mobs usually pulled to the bedroom.
Get a couple ITU potions, use one to get to the bedroom, hang out there
and ask to loot one when it drops.  They are lore, so any group pulling
there for any length of time will eventually run out of slots to hold
them even if they actually wanted to farm them.

Alternately, stop slacking off and actually join said bedroom group,
you can help them kill much faster and come by the loot honestly.

Solo... hmm.  ITU past the frogs, then regular invis past the spiders,
down to the gargoyle area, use charm swarm tactics to keep that
room clear; you dont' care about the rest of the zone unless you
want the exp while you are sitting around bored.  Pull spiders and
keep an eye on the timer, I guess.
