I have had quite literally dozens in the last week.  Most of them have
come shortly after melee ended, but a few have been on standing.  It's
really annoying actually.  I can be running full speed, stop, spin, and
cast with no trouble at all.  But if I'm standing unmoving in melee, let
the mob turn to flee and my next cast is almost always interrupted (or
a successful channel, nearing L20 so it's getting better), even when I
wait a bit (half-second to a second) before casting.  Or, if I stand and
don't wait for that animation to complete before starting a cast it will

occasionally interrupt (not the sure thing I get with melee situations).

I also get interruptions without moving or being hit while in melee,
that is, there will be a series of misses by both me and the mob before
and after the interrupted cast (ack, that reminds me, I think I forgot
to train Dodge).  And this is not the first character I have noticed
this with.  As for unexplainable channel messages, Kaev used to get
them a lot, I always figured there was some bogus movement going on with
the client and server somehow not quite being in sync.
