I'm not a real EQ expert but can summarize here:

"Tank" means the best at taking punishment and holding aggro so that others
in a group (casters, typically) can kill the mob. Warriors get the most hit
points and have the best taunt, so they are the prototype "tank". Of course
other classes can also perform this function more or less well, I believe
shadowknights are considered to be the next-best to a warrior.

DPS means "damage per second", typically only discussed with regard to
fighting classes (casters deal out damage in occasional massive nukes which
isn't the same thing). Warriors are not among the best fighters in terms of
DPS. Monks, I think, are still considered the best at dealing out the most
mob pain the fastest; rogues outshine even them but only if somebody else (a
good "tank") can hold the mob's attention or fear it so that the rogue is
stabbing it from behind. A rogue that tries to tank will die pretty quick.

I think someone else said that a shadowknight is the best balance between
tank and DPS abilities, and that is what I've observed. Other melee classes
(paladin, ranger, beastlord) have varying tank and DPS abilities which
others could rank better than I. With beastlords the issue is complicated by
whether and how to count what his warder does; then you can talk about
necromancer pets as tanks; etc.
