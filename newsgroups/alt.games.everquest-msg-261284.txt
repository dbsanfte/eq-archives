My OoW experience is very limited. I ran around in the laggy forest of the
first zone, getting constantly bothered by green mobs for ten minutes. I
zoned into a tunnel I found and soloed a bluecon jellyfish in a robe
(barely, had to use several discs and tricks) and then logged off.

But, one of the greenies in the first zone dropped me this thing that he
asks 3 of, I forgot its exact name, but I doublechecked it with the elder
PoD, that it's what he asked for.

Guess I was just very lucky or something.

(The other possibility is that SoE scanned the activity from my IP numbers
and decided to try to get me to buy OoW for my wizard account.)

Happy hunting.
