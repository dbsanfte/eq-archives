and was marketed as such.  Of course, you can go there and group at
30.

You don't need a horse.  And you should do a little research.  With a
new race on the moon, there are all sorts of zones up on Luclin for
you and your troop.  All 3 of my characters are having fun up there.
Tried Paludal or Netherbian yet?  early 20's to early 30's could
consider Marus Serus, then Dawnshroud.

Tell ya what - hit www.eqatlas.com and click on the "hunting guide by
level" link on the first page.  I think you'll be pleasantly
surprised.

You really don't need a horse.  My oldest char is 43 (one orange from
Cel Heal) and has a total of 600pp in the bank.  ::shrug::  My younger
2 'main alts' probably couldn't raise 200pp between 'em.

Research.  There are lots of options for you.  Get those late 20s and
30s to Dalnir if you don't like the moon!
