Sol A is a fun but nasty place. It is pretty densely populated, and
the goblins flee. Being a Druid that shouldn't be a problem, since you
can snare, but runners can be lethal, so be careful. Otherwise, exp is
very good as long as you are bringing your own group. Spawn rates seem
just about right for a good group, and since there are usually at
least a couple high level farmers, you can usually get assistance with
corpse retrievals if something goes wrong. There are also a few nice
equipment drops, like a serpent sight ring for the night blind. You
can always fight right at the zone until you get a feel for the place,
then move into one of the bigger rooms if you like it.
