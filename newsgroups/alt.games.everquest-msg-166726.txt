Heh. If you think EQ's economy is an example of what Adam Smith
described....well, I'd suggest you go actually read some Adam Smith. Which
you clearly have not, at present.

That's very damn funny actually -- the idea that Smith would have approved
of the EQ economy....In other news, Karl Marx praised the current Chinese
system as an exemplar of the benefits of centralized economic planning, and
Milton Friedman expressed his warm approval of the Brazilian government's
masterful money-supply management.
