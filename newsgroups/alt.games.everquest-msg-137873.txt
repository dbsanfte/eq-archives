Yes, at least for familiars.  Wizards basically had *nothing* they regularly
used before familiars were added that used Conjuration, and the spells we
have that we can use to raise that skill are all fairly slow casting.  This
means that most of us have sucky Conjuration.  Well, guess what skill
summoning a familiar uses?  Yup...Conjuration.

What this means is that there are a lot of us who, even after much spare
time summoning glowing bands or casting Eye of Zomm, still suck at
Conjuration.

Every fizzled familiar attempt costs about a bubble of mana.

What this means is that once we get the damn thing summoned, we hold on to
it.

Click on the vendor's name in the bazaar window and it points you straight
at them.
