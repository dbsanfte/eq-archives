Try "medding" back hitpoints after combat, all of the sudden, mana regen
seems quick.

A caster can go out and do alot of damage with KEI.  You can plan a soloing
session around it.  A melee can enjoy regen while it lasts, because it's not
long enough to make it a factor.  If I've got KEI on my pally, I'll log her
until I can use it.

Casters are expected to avoid melee, tanks can't avoid it.  So, assuming the
caster is smart enough to keep a good distance, they don't risk their HP.  A
melee must put theirs on the line every time they go into combat.

Except it's not balanced.  Casters can do alot of damage to a mob without
gettting their hands dirty.  Melee can do a little damage and hope they can
take what he mob puts out.

Better yet, increase the sitting regen rate to something similar to a
Paladin with Divine Purpose.  While they're in combat, it won't matter
because they have to be standing.  In groups, it's slow enough that a healer
is needed, but soloing, it's fast enough to make it a reasonable option.
