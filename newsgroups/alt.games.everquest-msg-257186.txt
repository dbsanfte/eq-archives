Yes but if I can put normal throwers in my ranged slot and use them, but 
get the procs off the arrows in my ammo slot (even though I have no bow 
and never will)... well that would be a Good Thing.

No indication that this will work, other than the fact that I was 
throwing axes out of my ammo slot with proccing axes in the range slot, 
and getting the proc despite using the damage/delay/bonus from the ammo 
weapon instead of the range weapon.

Even if it won't work for me, it might work for a class with both 
archery and throwing skills, and if the proc is an interesting one but 
the item it procs off of is expendable and hard to come by in quantity, 
it might be worth using throwing as a workaround, to get the proc but 
not use up the arrows.
