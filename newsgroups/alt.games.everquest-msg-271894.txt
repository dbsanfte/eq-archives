I dont know,I was always under the impression that a resisted snare 
generates *more* aggro.
When pulling Golems in PoV with my *55* Ranger,I get a *lot* of snare
resists,so I am somewhat an expert on this topic. :)
(I snare during pull to keep the mobs away from the lowbie
slowers in PoV,cause resisted slows generate huge aggro and dead
Enchanters. :)  )
Non SK tanks need noticable longer to peel the mob off of me,when
my snare was resisted,even after a Stun from a Pally the mobs
sometimes continue to chase me.
Another anecdotal observation is,usually when some other class pulls
and I am only there for DD and snare,I usually snare at 40% mob
health,when the snare is resisted mobs turn to me pretty often,while
on the other hand on a succesful snare they continue to ignore me(
and my mediocre damageoutput at 55 :)  ).
