Well, from the overly helpful Druid's point of view, he may be just
trying to buy time for the fighter. More than once I've heard a yell for
help, turned to see a charcter trying to crawl away with half a bubble
of health. There is almost no time to react - any hesitation at all and
the PC is dead - and there are usually many options open. You can
heal/DS/sow the character, or you can try to snare/root/blind/fear the
attacking MOB. Whatever you do though - you need to do it fast because
the PC you are trying to help may be only one hit from death. And to
make things worse, this usually occurrs at a range where the health bars
are not updated quickly and the PC may be far worse off than he looks.

Factors such as easiest to target also come into play. Rooting the
attacking MOB is usually not that big a deal in these instances unless
killing the MOB quickly is imperative - like when fighting a caster. But
when fighting a Griffon that is outside (room to move), can't heal
itself, etc. - the worst thing is to just wait for the root to break.
Once the MOB is rooted, there is plenty of time to bandage, heal etc.

BTW, I will always choose to heal or snare in this situation depending
on which character is easier to target. Mostly for the reason stated
that a rooted MOB will fight to the death, but also because the resists
are higher on roots than snares.

Oh well, I guess my point is that sometimes it's difficult to help when
help wasn't asked for but is probably needed. I am one of those that
absolutely HATES to see someone die near my character when there was
something I could have done. Rescuing players is one of the more
glorious aspects of this game.
