*shakes the monkey* Self Ports, from what I saw, are bought at Kelethin,
possibly at the other druid guilds.  The Circle Spells (Group ones) are
bought in Wakening lands, on the 2nd floor of the tower that leads up to
the plane of Growth portal.  And Yes, you don't need to get the port stones
anymore for any of the rings now.
