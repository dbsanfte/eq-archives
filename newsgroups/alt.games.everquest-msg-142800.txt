Because they give tremendous aggro to BIG heals, something clerics
do at levels where they are BIG heals.  Otherwise, you'd cast a
Greater Heal and die.  And so on and so on for each bigger heal,
ending with CHeal and the tremendous aggro it causes...  ;)

We simply don't have the melee skills to do that, either defensive
or offensive.

Or they honestly thought that clerics - who can't travel well (no
invis, no SoW, no snare) would REALLY need help getting back to
their corpse.  After all, everyone else gets a free ride back; it's
the cleric who has to make the trip when he dies...

That's a given, IMO.

Me too.  First off, the baby CHeals other healers are going to get
at 54 are going to totally eliminate the need for clerics in XP groups.
No *smart* group is going to take a cleric over a druid (ports, DS,
snare) or a shaman (slow and melee buffs.)  And with the newer spells
coming in at 56 for clerics, I'd REALLY REALLY glad mine is 56 now
instead of having to hustle to get there.

Yeah, unfortunately they seem to really have no clue about WHY people
play clerics to high-levels.
