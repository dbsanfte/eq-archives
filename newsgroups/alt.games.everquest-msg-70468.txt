I've never bothered carrying anything like that around. Then again, I
don't solo, and am 98% of the time grouped with a cleric, and the other
2% with *some* combination of healers. Items are too limited, limiting,
expensive, and inventory intensive. 

Except bandages, of course. I always carry those for the period across
the zone line right after a *near* TPW.
