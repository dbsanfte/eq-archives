Its also good for doing tests on movement speed.  Sense heading will
only get you pointed sort of the right way (a 45 degree arc) and fiddling
around till you get right on an axis is annoying.  With True North,
you can instantly get off the diagonals, so that you can look at your
movement as a discrete number of tics per unit time.

ODOMETER
/time
/loc
/pause 100
/time
/loc

so, cast TN in some nice open terrain, start running, and tap your
odometer key.  Once its run its course, apply a speed change, then
repeat.  Since you've only moved on one axis its simple to subtract
one loc from the other to get tics moved.

Of course there's little real use for this information, but heck, I
enjoy the intellectual puzzle of figuring out some sort of utility
for every spell I've got.

Calm/Lull line still eludes me
