Crystal Caverns might be an option now or in a few levels. The terrors there
give great exp and if you team up with an enchanter or so you can get some
wild exp here.

I soloed at lvl 35 some terrors and got about one quarter to 3 quarters per
kill. This is a lot considering 35 being a hell level. If you want some loot
you can go for the Queen and her room, but you need a good group to try
that.
Also the orcs drop very nice stuff, but most of it are rare drops. Got
myself a Crystalline Belt and a Herbalist Bag (common) though, and in a few
days I'm heading back in to get a Crystalline Robe and a Ry'gorr Oracle
Cloak.
