Indeed it does.  But I see two issues with using Perl or sed/awk/grep
etc...

A)  My Perl is VERY rusty.  :-)  Good excuse to brush up though.
B)  If folks want to use the scripts, they have to also go get Perl.
That could scare some interested folks away from using it.

Oooh - I do have my win32 Perl book up on the bookshelf though.

Of course, still have my trusty/rusty Delphi v2 CD here as well.
