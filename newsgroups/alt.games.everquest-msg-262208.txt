The numbers required for the titles bother me a little. 100 is Master
(or so used to say the game) but that's not the title you get. I'm
over 200 in some skills and referred to as a Journeyman, though I made
a Grandmaster Trophy... You have to get to 250 skill to be considered
a Master by the titles... I can only assume they need to leave some
room to expand the max trade skill skill levels, it's just odd that my
Apprentice Blacksmith is making magic armor and weapons...
