Not true. "ppl" and "plz" are intentional *shortenings* (happy, Sean?)
for lack of a better word. "prolly" is more often than not, a
mispronunciation leading to a misspelling. "prolly" is not so much
shorter than "probably" that it's enough easier to type to justify
butchering the language. "plz" makes you look lazy. "prolly" makes you
look uneducated.
