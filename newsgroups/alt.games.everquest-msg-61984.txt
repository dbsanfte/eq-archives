You forgot the RAM...

The best part about building your own machine is that you don't have to
upgrade the whole thing.

I just bought a new motherboard, Athlon XP 1700, and 512M for about $440.

Already have everything else, so it'll just be a swapout.

Oh yes.  Allow me to drop in a plug for PC Power and Cooling.  They make
ultra-quiet power supplies and fans.  Cost a bit more, but highly
recommended.  I replaced the power supplies in 4 of our machines, and the
noise reduction is significant and noticeable.  You can't even tell my
machine is on until it access the hard drive.
