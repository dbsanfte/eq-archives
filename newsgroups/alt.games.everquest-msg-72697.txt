Huh. I had no idea. Suggestions? (for the 'puter, I think I'm beyond help at
this point ;) ) I -was- actually thing of getting another 256mb, but wasn't
sure it would make that much difference. I'm certainly no computer jock, was
being guided mostly by my pocketbook (though the second 128mb only cost
about $30, so I really don't even have that excuse) EQ is one of my
passions, and if more horsepower would make it run better, I'll consider it
a good investment. Biggest thing I've noticed is that I -still- can't load
all the models and very few of the textures. I guess that should have given
me a clue, yes? Duh. :)
