I have never played AC but might be able to enlighten you.
A zone is simply a division of areas. To have all of the EQ world as one big
area would not be possible so the world is divided into about 100 zones.
Travelling between 2 zones is as simple as waliking into an invisible zone
line and waiting about 20 seconds for the next zone to load.

I have played melee and casters in EQ. Pure casters are more fun to play (
IMO ) because of the diversity of spells and such. You could play a class
that is a mixture of both such as a shaman or paladin. I would just read up
on the classes to see which one you like the sound of. If you like more than
one, make more than one charachter!

EQ is not free. $10 a month like AC but if you buy 3 months at a time you
get a $5 discount.

In EQ the highest level is 60. This level was designed to be reached in
approximately 1 year of play but of course that is wildly variable.

When you die you do not lose anything except experience. You do however,
have to return to where you died to retreive your equipment unless a high
level player will ressurect you.
