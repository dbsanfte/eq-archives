You are missing a simple concept here, "delayed gratification"

The difference between a two year old and a four year old is that the
two year old has very little concept of this.  Do what you want right now,
is it fun or not?  A four year old, on the other hand, has begun to
grasp the idea that instead of something a little fun now, you sometimes
do some work for something that will be fun later.

Our society has worked hard to eradicate the idea of delayed
gratification, but its hard to wipe out.

In EQ, we are constantly presented with this concept.  Meditate
so we can have full mana for the next fight.  Lock down the numlock
key and wait to cross WK so you can hunt in NK.  Sit and camp
Grimmie for days on end so you can get your Aegis of Life.  Grind
Exp out so you can get to that next spell level or discipline level.
Kill endless green hill giants so you can buy your Tboots.

I doubt you'll find many players in the game who have never done
something boring in order to get a reward they will enjoy -later-
