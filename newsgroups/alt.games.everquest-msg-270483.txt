Oh, I think he is. I have heard many talk about how they feel they have 
a big investment in their EQ characters and in terms of time spent on 
them, I bet they do. I know an arguement can be made about whether time 
into characters in an MMORPG ought to be considered an investment of not 
but it is irrelevant. They feel this way and that is enough for them to 
choose to stay where they are. Look at UO in its eighth year now. 
Another example would be those who are still playing Asheron's Call and 
much more surprisingly those that remain with Asheron's Call 2.

Sure, EQ will lose players to other games given how time consuming these 
games are but they are starting with such a large player base that I 
would predict they will still have servers up and be releasing 
expansions years from now.
