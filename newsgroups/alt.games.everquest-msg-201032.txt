This is an article about the Electronic Entertainment Expo that was
held at the L.A. Convention Center last week.  The complete article is
available on-line at:

Along those lines, one of the more ubiquitous presences at this year�s
convention was G4 TV, a new cable channel that is to video games what
MTV is to music, a network, as the press material says, "all about
video games and the gamer lifestyle." Capturing the gamer lifestyle,
though, is a questionable goal. Consider this basic fact of gaming
life: It�s completely asocial. Even if you�re playing Sony�s EverQuest
online with friends (you�re a dark-elf cleric living in Antonica; your
best friend is an Erudite necromancer on the continent of Odus), in
reality you�re probably both in separate living rooms, staring into a
video monitor at 2 a.m. on a Saturday night. Iksar Monks from Kunark
are well-represented in the less-illustrious fraternity of Guys
Without Dates.
