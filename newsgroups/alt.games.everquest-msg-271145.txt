I know and I've seen them too. But hey, that's their problem. I don't 
wait long for people like that when I lead a group and I am inviting 
people to play in it. If they have to waste my time getting every buff 
under the sun, not to mention the time of my other groupmates, I just 
replace them and send then a tell to let them know. And I've rarely had 
people leave my groups for buffs although sometimes that does happen. 
And I have to agree that I do not appreciate it when it does. I mean it 
is nice to have them but it is not required to play and have fun.
