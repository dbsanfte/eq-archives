cribbed from "The Rantings of Lum the Mad"

http://lumthemad.net/story.php?story=2314

The UK version of Edge magazine has a look inside Sony Online Entertainment,
as well as some words from their CEO, Kelly Flock, and boy did he have a few
things to say.

When asked if he takes into account consumer input Flock is dismissive,
relying instead on the expertise of his staff. "No, we never talk to
consumers - they just f*** us up. Someone asked for a copy of our market
research which made us take the decision to do EverQuest. I said we hadn't
done any market research. Had we done, the game would never have been made.
We never focus on them. Gamers don't know what they want. We just want to
know if they have a valid credit card."
