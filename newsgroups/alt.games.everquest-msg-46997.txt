When I was a newbie I went on a day trip with my ranger from Qeynos through the
Karanas (was totally awed by the wizard spires back then) to Highhold (where a
nice shaman buffed and sowed me and led me quickly to the exit).  Drank ale and
talked with some HUGE guy till daylight before running through Kithicor.  Then
through the commonlands, (the people KILLED BEARS THERE !!!) to Freeport, took
the boat to Butcherblock and visited Greater Fay.
I was level 8 or 9 - left all my "high dollar" leather armor in the bank in
case I died.  I sure didn't have money for a port back then :).
I met a nice level 5 ranger in Kelethin - sat in one of the taverns and drank a
few ales.  He was a newbie too - those ales were probably EXPENSIVE for him.
We ran out and did some sightseeing in the Steamfont Mountains.  Very
beautiful.  
Freaked out when I first saw Crushbone with the big fires out front and those
nasty looking orcs (YUCK!).  Stayed out of Lesser Fay - (some guy in a robe
advised us NOT to vacation there :).
Before I headed for home I gave him the clothes off my back, (my "old"
patchwork stuff - but a full set!!!) and invited him to come visit in Qeynos
some day.
That was, without a doubt, the most memorable day I ever spent in Norath....
