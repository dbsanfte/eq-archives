I didn't see stuns, so no clue on thier resists.

In Mistmoore dungeon, the high 40's bard / enchanter was having no problems
mezing.  All adds were instantly stopped, and it was repeated over several
adventures.

The root parking was mostly some level 65 adventures we did in Guk dungeon.
I'm not certain they were getting no resists, but nobody complained, and
things stayed well under control.

The trip where pacify was repeatedly resisted was a level 65 adventure in
Tak dungeon.
