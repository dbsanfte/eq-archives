Heh, yep, I remember hearing about that.  So the spell is pretty much
just a placeholder eh?

I did think of a possible use for PLing, the mana you get back is based
on pet HP right?  So if someone has a clicky HP buffing item (one that
comes to mind is Donal's Arms for Valor, 220 HP free buff) they could
boost the mana back to me off this assuming I can afford to spend cash
on malachites for it...  but since I don't know any of the actual
numbers you'd get, I can't say if a 220 hp boost would make this worth
while.

Any way you look at it, instant and free is a lot better than casting
time and mana to cast.  When is the sol Ro item quest doable?

But by then don't we have another summoned weapon?  Ah here it is,
Staff of Tracing, level 8 summon... and its got a click Flare on it so
my Shaman friend and I can play Paintball

I remember thinking that since I can cast my own DS that any pet other
than the mage one would be better.  But DS duration is short, eats
mana, and the DS isn't as good as the fire pet's native one, right?

Aye, I've done that before, but in this case I had only just hit pet
level, had my friend there and wanted to keep playing; I sat down and
memmed one pet plus the upgraded nuke and went back to playing

Of course rusty 2 handers aren't quite as good as rusty halberds
anyway, and using either will be less and less interesting as I level
up anyway, its too bad weapons only raise the max (and therefore
average) damage cap, instead of adding a bit to performance for all
pets.  Aren't there some outrageously high damage weapons that drop off
FM giants and such that make this tactic useful well up into the 20s?
