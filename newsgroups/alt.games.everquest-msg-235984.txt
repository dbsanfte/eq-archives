This is not a standard PL'ed toon. At least not the ones I have done or met.
It is easy to get to 50+ in about 2 days played (maybe he got better than
that not sure) I have leveled my zerk to 45 in 1 day, 4 hours, and all
weapon skills and offense/defense are maxed. Course I only use a cleric to
PL so maybe that has something to do with it as well.
Still like my BL better though.............
That being said, I would also never pick a hard adventure with a group I had
never grouped with before no matter what. I always assume it will take at
least one adventure to learn people's playing styles so we can mesh (or not)
before trying hard. Usually if the group could handle a hard then the normal
is done in less than 30 minutes so it usually not an impact to most people
to stay for the second.
