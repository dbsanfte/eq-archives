Run 3 is much better than JBoots.  Yes, JBoots are insta click... but they
take a slot, are dispellable, and then have a delay of your reaction time
before you put them on again... as a druid, I should say before you put them
on in the first place.

More importantly, Run 3 works indoors, while SOW and JBoots require that you
cast before entering, and eventually wear off unless you arrange to go
outside periodically, a real nuisance.

JBoots are very nice as a dispell preventer, on outdoor dragons... but in the
long run, I think every class in the game benefits more from Run 3 than from
any other first tier AA.
