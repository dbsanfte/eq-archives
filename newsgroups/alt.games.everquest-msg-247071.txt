Personally I'd rather see the CoH posts elsewhere... ie I'd rather not 
see them at all. :) But I'm willing to cut R.L. more a lot more slack 
than joe-spammer.

Its not what you know, its who you know. You should know that biz :)

Having said that I haven't done more than skim the coh posts for eq 
related or other interesting discussion... I have zilch interest in CoH 
myself.
