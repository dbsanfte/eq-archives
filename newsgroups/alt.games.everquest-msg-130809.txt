Never said I was intolerant of them.  Intolerance comes with a price, and in
this case that price would be my not hearing what you have to say.  I'd
rather hear what you have to say.  You feel free to post the way you like,

And I do thank you for bottom posting this last reply.  Much easier to
follow. :-)
