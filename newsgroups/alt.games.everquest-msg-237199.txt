Do you consider stubbing your toe an important event in your life?

Perhaps THIS life, compared to the length of time your soul itself
will exist, is nothing more than, well, stubbing your toe.  That is,
in the end, horrible things happening aren't all that horrible in
the grand scheme of things.

Just an alternate explanation why God may allow seemingly horrible
things to happen.  Perhaps you have to experience bad to understand
good, have to experience sadness to understand happiness, etc.  And
perhaps those negative experiences (this life) happen in just the
tinyest blink of an eye compared to how long our soul will live.
