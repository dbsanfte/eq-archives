I believe its a 1/1 conversion ratio, the skill has a refresh time, but
fairly short (4 sec?).

The big thing isn't that meat drops, but that meat is *vendor sold*.
Mordin's meats in Thurgadin being what stands out in my mind.

This allows the necro to sit at the vendor and pump out bone chips for
something like 1 silver 3 copper per chip, which is why masochistic people
determined to go +iksar faction want it, for the bone chip faction quest
with Trooper Mozo (sp?) in Field of Bone.
