I know exactly what you mean, and its very hard to face.  Static camps 
were the way EQ worked, and you just faced that fact.  But now I know 
better, I've played a moving game with a deadline to keep us all tight, 
and sitting in one place for hours on end pales in comparison.

Funny thing is, the original "vision" of the game was for a movement 
based approach.  We were supposed to zone in to a place like Permafrost, 
and roam around killing things, continuing to move forward with the 
threat of repops behind us, hoping to get lucky stumbling across nameds, 
clearing everything so on our second go around some of the nameds would 
replace PHs, and so forth.

But the static locations of PH/Named, and their rarity, and the fast but 
predicatable repop times and the presence of other players, meant it was 
much more efficient to set up a "camp" where you kill as many mobs and 
PH in one spot as you can before repops start, and then continue to 
clear that area.  This approach meant you could "break" the spawn so you 
could fight each mob as it popped, no more CC or multitanking needed. 
And it meant you didn't have other people coming in and "cherry picking" 
the nameds you spawned without having done the work.  Basically, the way 
the game was designed meant behaviour emerged that was the opposite of 
what the designer intended.

LDoN fixed that by removing repops and removing the "other players".

I'm not sure its possible to convince groups to use the "vision" plan in 
real dungeons, even uncrowded ones, but I'd like to try it; a "crawl" 
approach would make Sebilis or Chardok or places like that a lot more 
fun, and I think they are empty enough these days that the "other 
player" syndrom might not be too much of a worry.

Other balms for your pain; raids tend to move thru content to get to a 
goal, kill it, and be finished there.  And Howling Stones is usually 
approached on a moving basis, go thru a wing rather than sit and wait in 
one spot for repops.  And there are "event" encounters out there in 
places like Fungusgrove, POJ trials, LOY, where you trigger an encounter 
that takes place in a time limited environment.  Most of this stuff is 
high end game, so you are just coming in to the ability to do it as LDoN 
exp starts to suck.
