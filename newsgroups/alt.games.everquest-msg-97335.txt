Derivation != definition

He was asking about the word's etymology (origin), not its
meaning, which had already been provided earlier.

I'm kind of curious about that one myself.

It's especially odd given that the word "twink" in other
contexts has two main meanings:

  In the gay community, a "twink" is a "pretty-boy"
  type of homosexual (as opposed to the big macho
  type, the effeminate type, etc.)  Think "bimbo blonde"
  in a gay context.

  In the music community, "twink" is the sound
  that a toy piano makes.

  In some MUDs/MUSHs, a "twink" is a grief player,
  *not* an assisted newbie.

So how did it arise in the gaming community as a term
meaning having freebies handed to you?  I have this
sneaking suspicion it's a mutation of the first example,
since gay twinks (like female bimbos in a heterosexual
setting) are young and often showered with gifts and
protected from the harsher realities, just like someone's
newbie secondary character.  Plus given that the
new character is likely to be the same sex as the
main, maybe that *is* the link, used in an ironic way.
