Selling your +2 shield 

By JARED KENDALL
Special to The Advocate Online 

When folks hear about online gamers selling gear from those games for
hard cash, the reactions generally take one of two forms: Amusement
and disbelief. Why would someone pay real money for a sword-wielding
Everquest character? How in the heck can an Ultima Online castle be
worth a few hundred bucks?

In reality, these costs are perfectly reasonable. All you have to do
to understand is get over the conceptual barrier of real versus
electronic. In other words, you have to realize that a toy is a toy,
whether it be in digital form or not.

When an automotive enthusiast springs for a re-bored V-8 with a
nitrous injector, nobody assumes they're insane. When a coin collector
buys a stereo microscope (no, it doesn't play the Beatles -- it uses
two objectives so you can see little-bitty objects in three
dimensions) you don't figure he's stupid. You realize that such
gadgets are tools that allow their owners to more fully enjoy their
hobbies. Sure, you wouldn't buy them. But that doesn't mean anyone who
does must automatically have no concept of the value of a buck.

Online gamers also have their own tools of the trade. For some types
of games, it's a matter of having excellent physical hardware: A fast
computer, a great graphics card, complicated input devices. For
role-playing gamers who dwell in persistent environments like
Everquest, Ultima Online and Asheron's Call, characters, weapons,
armor, and even buildings can all constitute the tools of the trade.
Having them can make playing the games more fun. Getting them can take
real work.

Should it be any surprise that some folks are willing to pay for them?

Most of the gaming companies frown upon any sort of
cash-for-game-items swap. They know that such deals anger gaming
purists who work for their items, and they also know that they aren't
seeing a dime out of the deal. Their indignation is a little
ridiculous, however. After all, they're the ones who created the value
for the gear in the first place.

I've long felt that what gaming firms should do is to simply get in on
the action in the first place. If a flaming sword of death fetches $20
on eBay, why not start selling it yourself? There will always be
players with the cash and the desire to cut a few corners. Allowing
them to do so simply acknowledges the fact that you are a business,
and your product has value.

Now, one gaming company seems to agree with me. MindArk
(http://www.mindark.com/), a Swedish firm, is creating a game called
Project Entropia where real money and game money will be exchanged
freely. The game is currently in testing, but when it reaches release,
it will be interesting to see how players react to the straightforward
nature of MindArk's proposition.

While auctioning off of characters and gear has taken place in other
games in the past, such commerce has always been the domain of a small
minority of players. Trying to get just about everyone to pitch in may
be a more difficult proposition. Sure, MindArk says that you'll also
be able to earn game cash the old-fashioned way, going on quests and
so forth, but that central commercial aspect will remain. Will players
be turned off by the notion that part of their competitive edge could
be determined by the size of their credit limit?

Personally, I avoid most of these vast multiplayer games primarily
because I know how much I enjoy them. It's not the money that concerns
me, it's the time. I've never been the sort to pay for items, but I
have been known to log far more hours than I should playing games. For
me, abstinence seems to be the best choice. For those who play, these
games can offer a welcome diversion from the daily grind. Just make
sure you don't quit your day job. Or get fired. If MindArk has
anything to say about it, you're going to need those paychecks.
