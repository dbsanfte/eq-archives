Don't be an asshole...

Note for Mike:  You are NOT "screwed", turning in your
guild note gives you nothing of lasting value, just a
little bit of exp and a lousy newbie tunic.

Most of these "starter" quests are there just to
encourage newbies to actually locate their guild hall,
and to give them a "practice quest" to learn how to
do questing.

So don't worry about it if you didn't do it.

As another poster mentioned, some Iksar newbie quests
actually give better rewards after multi-stage upgrades,
but even those are worth doing mostly for the adventure
involved, since the rewards are still exceeded by things
you can get through regular adventuring.

Other than item rewards, *no* newbie quest gives anything
you can't live without.  They don't give actual "membership"
in the guild (you're already a "member" by virtue of
being <insert-your-class-type-here>), or any other sort
of indispensible result.
