Got to love it now that the moderator at SOE forum is allowed to post
patch note a few hours ahead of the expected server downtimes.  Here's
the latest one:

June 6, 2007

*** Highlights ***

- Have you ever been to an SOE Fan Faire? Have you ever been to Las
Vegas? Now's the time to think about doing both at the same time!
August 2nd - 5th SOE is holding its 2007 Fan Faire at the Rio
All-Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas Nevada! Visit the official SOE
Fan Faire website at http://events.station.sony.com/fanfaire/ for more
information about other activities.

- So you want to see more events? Ever try running your own? Visit the
EQplayers website to view the Tip of the Week on running Player-Run
Events in EverQuest.

 

*** Spells ***

- The mana cost incurred by fizzling now includes focus effect and
specialization savings, reducing the amount of mana that is used on a
fizzle.
- The bard fizzle cap has been increased from 95% to 100%.
- The bard command '/melody' has been changed to now attempt to
re-sing a song that misses a note, resuming the melody chain once it's
successfully done so.
- Specialized bard songs (mez, charm, stun, etc.) will now have a 2%
fizzle rate, given max skill and level-appropriate stats.
- General purpose bard songs (regen, haste, speed, etc.) will now have
a 0% fizzle rate given max skill and level-appropriate stats.


- The EverQuest Team

looks like some serious nerfing of bard with increased fizzle rates
but the ability to resume missed note in melody is a nice change.  I
do see minor exploit if the resume is automatic, someone could use
this to go afk and let bard sing for skillups.
