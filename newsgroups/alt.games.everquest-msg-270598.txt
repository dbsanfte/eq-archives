    Oh good!  I guess this means I get my machine reloaded soon.

    It needs it too.  It often crashes when I first start it up, and
sometimes shuts down for no apparent reason when I'm doing something
innocuous like typing in a post.  And when I ctrl-alt-delete at start up,
the pop up box tells me I have 15 or 16 processes running, though *I'm*
running no programs at all.  I've done spyware and virus checks, and though
processes just won't go away.

   I'm tired of having to boot my computer up twice every time I want to
use it.  So thanks again for pointing him in the right direction.
