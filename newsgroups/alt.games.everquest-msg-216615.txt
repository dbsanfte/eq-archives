Well it sounds like he was pretty clueless to me.  I mean, even though
he did ask first, apparently he didn't think that maybe somebody WOULD
actually object to his wanting to work on his skill-up for that weapon
and probably should have brought some extra weapons just in case.  

Also, if one wanted to raise their skill-ups on a weapon, there are
ways they could do it without affecting other people, either by
soloing some light blues (though I do realize warriors are not too
great at soloing) or else going to some place where a group was
fighting mobs that they could raise their skill on and telling that
group that you didn't want to join their group but just wanted to work
on your weapon skill and ask if they minded if you took a few swings
at their mob (maybe waiting till the mob was below 50% so you wouldn't
KS them).  I doubt too many groups would mind someone helping them
kill their mobs faster and not KS'ing them.
