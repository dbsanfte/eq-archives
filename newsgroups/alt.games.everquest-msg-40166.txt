Exactly. Nobody seems to be grasping this. Either that, or they are
intentionally missing the point so they can defend Verant for the sake
of defending them.

The problem is that Verant is talking out of the side of their mouth
on this issue. They don't want their competitors to know how many
people are playing EverQuest, but they continually give numerical
figures of their subscriber base. I don't think Verant are being
completely forthright about this decision.
