Packaged nicely for your convenience: what I am still waiting for.
Even if you *think* they've been answered, indulge me and set all your
cards on the table so I can see where the mixup is. Try to avoid gross
generalizations. Deal with what is specifically happening in this
patch. Sure, making the game too easy is bad, but you have to show how
THIS PATCH makes it too easy.

You can answer this instead of the big post above it, if you like.
You'll present all your arguments in a nice packaged form. If they're
as strong as you maintain, this will give them a chance to hold up
under anything I can throw at them without any spins or insults.


1. How do the changes make the game *too easy* (cheapen the game) and
how will they affect the future. Specifically.

(Not how will it make it easier, everyone agrees that life got a
little easier with the patch; how will it make it *too* easy. You must
also address how its different from the changes that happened before
(in the first year), changes which obviously DIDN'T make it too easy.
Since most of us were having fun pre-patch back then, would you have
been arguing that the game was cheapened? And in the case of 1-10
changes, you have to show how such an insignificant amount of change
will affect the game as a whole. Remember, they are not ELIMINATING
L1-10.... And when I say how well they affect the future I mean the
specific changes, not generalizations of how the game being too easy
would)

2. Where is the proof that the changes will lead to more, and more
damaging, changes down the road?

(This is the slippery slope arguiment, so to actually support it (and
therefore support the idea the patch is bad because of it) you have to
point out the evidence for each step until the game is damaged. "I
just fear for the future" is not a valid answer, it's a valid opinion
(if paranoid) but doesn't support tonight's changes as being bad. Even
Lokari admitted that there's no harm done as long as the patches stop
here.)


Some of these you've already tried to answer, but I won't address them
pre emptively. You have an open field to present your arguments, if
you can. I'll answer whatever you bring forward, but I'll wait for you
to do it to be completely fair.
