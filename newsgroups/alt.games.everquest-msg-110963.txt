What's wrong with the one that comes with Windows?

You'll find it called c:\windows\ramdrive.sys

Example setup (2 MB ramdrive):  devicehigh=ramdrive.sys /E 2048

I used to love setting up AutoCad (Rev 2.18) on double-floppy systems.
I'd do it by grabbing a chunk of memory and setting up a ramdrive to
hold the necessary extra bits.  Really confused a lot of people who
didn't realize (way back then) that you could do such things.


As the information's miserably hard to find at Microsoft's website,
here's the configuration rules for ramdrive:

RAMDRIVE.SYS
============

Uses part of your computer's random-access memory (RAM) to simulate a
hard disk drive. This device driver must be loaded by a DEVICE or
DEVICEHIGH command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

RAM drives are much faster than hard disk drives because your computer
can read information faster from memory than from a hard disk. A RAM
drive appears to be a normal hard disk drive; you can use it just as
you would any hard disk drive. The most important difference between a
real disk drive and a RAM drive is that because it exists only in
memory, information on a RAM drive is lost when you turn off or
restart your computer. You can set up as many RAM drives as you want,
up to the amount of memory your computer has. To do this, add one
RAMDRIVE.SYS line to your CONFIG.SYS file for each additional RAM
drive you want.

Syntax

 DEVICE=[drive:][path]RAMDRIVE.SYS [DiskSize SectorSize [NumEntries]]]
 [/E | /A]

Parameters

[drive:][path]
   Specifies the location of the RAMDRIVE.SYS file.

DiskSize
   Specifies how many kilobytes of memory you want to use for the RAM
   drive. For example, to create a 640K RAM drive, specify 640. If you
   don't specify an amount, RAMDrive will create a 64K RAM drive. You
   can specify a value from 4 to 32767. However, you cannot specify
   more memory than your system has available.

SectorSize
   Specifies the disk sector size in bytes. The size can be 128, 256,
   or 512 bytes. (If you include a SectorSize value, you must also
   include a value for DiskSize.)

   Generally, you should use the default sector size of 512 bytes.

NumEntries
   Limits the number of files and directories you can create in the
   RAM drive's root directory. The limit can be from 2 to 1024
   entries; the limit you specify is rounded up to the nearest sector
   size boundary. If you do not specify a limit, you can create up to
   64 entries in the RAM drive's root directory. (If you include a
   value for NumEntries, you must also include values for DiskSize and
   SectorSize.)

   If there is not enough memory to create the RAM drive as specified,
   RAMDrive will try to create it with a limit of 16 directory
   entries.
   This may result in a RAM drive with a different limit from the one
   you specified.

Switches

/E
   Creates the RAM drive in extended memory.

   For RAMDrive to use extended memory, your system must be configured
   so that it provides extended memory, and a DEVICE command for the
   extended-memory manager (such as HIMEM.SYS) must appear in your
   CONFIG.SYS file before the DEVICE command for RAMDRIVE.SYS. In
   general, it is best to create a RAM drive in extended memory if
   your system has extended memory.

/A
   Creates the RAM drive in expanded memory.

   For RAMDrive to use expanded memory, your system must be configured
   so that it provides expanded memory, and the DEVICE command for the
   expanded-memory manager (such as EMM386, 386MAX, CEMM, or QEMM)
   must appear in your CONFIG.SYS file before DEVICE command for
   RAMDRIVE.SYS.
