I can only speak for myself, but I'm no longer excited about my
druid reaching level 29.  :(  I haven't been able to work up the
desire to login and play the last few days.  Level 29 isn't a fun
and magic thing for me to strive for anymore.  Oh well...

Now I'm just waiting for SOE to equip all cities with NPC clerics
that can ressurect you for a fee.  And allow you to hire mercenaries
(NPC warriors) for a fee.  Don't forget about the NPC enchanters
that can give you breeze/clarity/c2/kei.  And the NPC shamans and
druids and clerics that can buff you.

Hell, put them all right in the same building.  Go to cleric_01,
get your rez.  Then hire a few mercenaries -- warrior_01 and
warrior_02.  Then get a bunch of buffs from cleric_01, druid_01,
and shaman_01.  Then get your crack from enchanter_01.  Lastly,
get your port from wizard_01 (only available if you blow $$$ on
PoP, of course).

Yippee...

P.S. Yes, I'm whining, you anti-whine whiners.  Suck me.
