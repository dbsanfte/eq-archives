Well, I would almost like to say it had a positive impact on my life. I
really started to detest TV-shows with all the crap and reruns there.
I still read books, a bit less, but still about finishing 1 per week.

I still keep up friendships by going to bars and such, I just don't make it
too late and don't drink too much so I can squeeze an hour or two playing
after it. This looks bad, but in effect I don't have hangovers anymore and
that really helps focus at work the next day.

I must say I played lots of games before EQ, and I am starting to notice the
difference in my wallet of not buying at least 1 new game every month, a
game I usually discard after that month and only rarely go back to.

Still not too addicted (not interfering with work and such), but I do play
every spare moment I have.


Just another story, but it happens to be real and mine.
