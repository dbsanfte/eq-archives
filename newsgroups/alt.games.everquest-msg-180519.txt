And the people you annoy are free to report you.

Freedom is a two-way street. You are free to be an off-topic ass, and
your ISP is free to disconnect you for being an annoyance to others. We
are free to laugh at you when you pop back in here bitching and moaning
about having to get a new ISP.

Perhaps then you will see that freedom is not unilateral. You must be a
decent person or the rest of the society will shun you.
With "phreak" in your username, I find it highly unlikely. I have found
the 13 year old script kiddie crowd to be particularly clue-resistant.
