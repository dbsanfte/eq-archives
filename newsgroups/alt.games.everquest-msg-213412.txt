They upped the maximum number of traders in one of the patches at the
end of August.  Here's the patch message:

"- Bazaar - We have increased the limit on the number of traders in
the bazaar.  We fixed an issue that would cause the "Begin Trader"
button to be disabled if a player tried to use it when the maximum
number of traders was reached.  And the "Held" slot option was removed
from the search, since it is not a valid option."

Sounds like it has some problems...
