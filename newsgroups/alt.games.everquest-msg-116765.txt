Actually I do run Windows at 800x600, but EQ I keep at 640x480.  And I would
get a bigger monitor but take a look at http://www.pricewatch.com and see
why not. Since 800x600 is an extra 25% of pixels in the same space, I'd need
to have an extra 25% width and height of monitor.  So a 24" (22.5" viewable)
or more would be appropriate (which means I'd be able to jump Windows
resolution up to 1024x768 now).  Well once you pass a 19" monitor, you seem
to start paying about $100 per inch in price increases, and the differences
just keep going up.  Now if I could find a MUCH cheaper (still new, not used
as reason for cheaper, full warranty included) 24"+ monitor, that would be a
completely different story.
