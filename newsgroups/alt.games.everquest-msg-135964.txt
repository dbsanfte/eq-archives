So, if you justify your labels its ok to use them on me, but if I
justify my label (i.e. bigot), then you start all sorts of hysterical
hyperbola, personal attacks, and other such temper tantrums?  With
your double-standards, ever thought of going into politics?

Don't worry, I have no interest in attacking any family you may or may
not in fact have.  Why give you the satisfaction?

To bad you didn't make any points about my points, then your side of
the discussion might have been more effective.

To your imagination only, dear.

That pot/kettle thing again, I see.

I find it really funny that you quote my words below, yet get the
emphasis WRONG above!

make

You're not "making my life harder".  You have no direct effect on my
life.  I never said that YOU did.  The problem here is that you
selectively ignore things if you find it convenient to do so.  For
example, you somehow translate "ignorant idiots like you" to mean
simply "you".   You also decided my comment was about Usenet postings,
while I never specified.

> Ergo, you won't mind me continuing my USENET crusade, right???   :^)

Ah, so you think of it as a crusade, do you?

As to your queston: Not at all.  You as an individual are irrelevant,
my interest was in how your opinion and your justification of that
opinion (or lack thereof) could be useful to me in understanding
others who voiced that same opinion.  You have been useful in that
regard, although I was hoping for a more challenging and substantive
debate.
