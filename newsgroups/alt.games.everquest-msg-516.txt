Once upon a time, I wondered about these guides that other people spoke
of.  Guides?  GM's?  What is this myth that you speak about?  I had
petitioned several times (fell through the earth, stuck in a wall etc)
to no avail.  No one ever answered my petitions.

I figured that either A)  There really was no such thing, and it was all
a myth, or B)  They just didn't care.

Couple of months ago I went LD in the Hole.  When I got logged back on,
I was stuck in the ceiling, couldn't stand to cast gate, couldn't sit
down, couldn't move.  I /petitioned.  Within 20 minutes a guide had
answered my call.  Luckily we had a high level mage with us who cast
Call of the Hero on me, and turns out that I didn't need the guide's
assistance after all, but I was very impressed that someone actually
answered me.

Couple of weeks later we got a system wide message that the gnomes were
having trouble with the boat to Vel, and were hoping to have the boat
fixed as soon as possible.  I sent a /tell to the guide who had sent out
that message that I thought that was a really cool way to roleplay the
problems they were having with the boats.  The guide actually answered
me back and told me thanks!!

Ok.  So, I've never met anything called a guide before, but less and
less am I beginning to think that they are a hoax invented by Verant.

Went to a Fear raid a couple of nights ago.  Died a couple of times.
/consented the monk.  Nothing.  In fact, /consent didn't work for anyone
who had more than one corpse.  They couldn't drag it to a safe place.
/petitioned.  A guide actually answered me back and told me she was in
Fear right now, and was summoning my corpses for me.  Very cool.  I
never saw her, she was gone by the time I got there, but I have now been
helped by a guide.  Wow.

Yesterday some friends and I were hanging out in West Commons.  We were
bored, and just running around being silly.  I was rezzing newbies, the
druid was buffing them, the chanter was casting clarity on them.  We
were just bored, acting silly, and helping out newbies to relieve our
boredom.  A guide named Scalefoot shows up, and just sits around and
talks to us for about half an hour while he's talking to people who need
his help.  Holy Moly.  I've finally met a guide.  And he was nice.  And
human.  And real.  And very cool.

Today some guild mates and I were camping the wurms in Great Divide.
One of my friends went to sleep at the keyboard, right where one of the
wurms pop.  We tried spamming him out.  We tried casting spells at him,
and jumping on him, hoping the noise would wake him up enough for him to
log out.  He slept through it all.  Finally, we felt that we had no
option other than to /petition.  Who shows up, but the same guide that I
had hung out with yesterday, Scalefoot.  We tell him our dilemma, and he
disappears.  Next thing we know the sleepy head guild mate disappears
too.  Do a /who on him, and he's sitting safe and sound in Grobb.  =)

I'm very proud of Verant.  They started out rough, but now the guides
are there, they help, they're friendly- it's a thankless task, but they
do it with a friendly attitude.  Things are so much better now than they
used to be.  Once upon a time I can remember when there was no help for
you.  If you died because of a bug in the game, then that's just too
bad.  It's nice to know that Verant has done a wonderful job of getting
some great guides, and are there to help you out when there's a problem.

Thanks Verant.
