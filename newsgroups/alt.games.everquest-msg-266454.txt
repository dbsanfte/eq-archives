You forgot Jews. They were also defined as nonhuman to facilitate the 
holocaust. After all, if they weren't humans, they had no rights, and if 
they had no rights that really streamlined things...

I can see it now...some guy says..."Killing Jews is murder...

And our twit here saying... "Great for you, but its factually incorrect. 
A Jew is by definition not a human being. Its a Jew. --  So we can kill
