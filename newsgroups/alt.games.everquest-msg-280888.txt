Yes, it will.  I don't intend to make the journey with a level 60.  The 
simple fact that it's a long run and somewhat dangerous (with consequences 
if you don't make it) makes the trip a challenge in itself.

You're thinking that this is all nostalgia and that the old game is not 
worth playing for itself.  I have a different opinion and hold it strongly. 
I won't buy any more expansion packs -- I stopped after Luclin -- and am not 
really interested in the game as it is today.  To me today's game has no 
challenge and no excitement at all.  This is why I want to go back to 
pre-Luclin.

Why did you quit?  I am interested....

Nonsense.  The sense of wonder and excitement of being a newbie with no clue 
is gone forever, but the old game is still there with all the fun.

The problem, of course, is that half the game's content, including many, 
many quests, simply cannot be completed without PoK at least.
