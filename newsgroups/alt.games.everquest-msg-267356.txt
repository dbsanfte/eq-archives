Yeah, just an EQ2--or EQ1 for that matter--with *no* colons in the header 
should suffice.  Sounds sensible, reasonable, and a much better idea than 
the kneejerk reaction of another group right now.  I've seen that happen 
before, and in a lot of ways splitting a group creates more problems than it 
solves.

Everybody just needs to calm down for a bit.
