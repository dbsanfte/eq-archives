OK, I give up.  All I want is a lousy pair of leather boots for a
lowbie character of mine who's based in Freeport, but I'm damned if I
can find anyone who sells them.  That Leather and Hide place in East
Freeport has all leather but boots, and they're nowhere else that I
can find...

Enlighten me please....
