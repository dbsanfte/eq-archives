Your acronym doesn't ring a bell.  The one he was working on was a 6.6 
Meter telescope to go in the dome of the old 120" reflector at Lick 
Observatory.  There was some sort of a change of plans, though, where it 
was going to itself be a proof-of-concept model for a much larger 
telescope...  The figure 30 meters sticks in my head, but that almost 
seems ludicrously big.  Then there was something about them scrapping the 
whole project to just make the bigger telescope.  I haven't checked where 
all this was at for a few months, now though.

But the point was, it was gonna cost a buttload, and it's a good thing the 
Packard Foundation was going to shell out quite a bit for it. :)
