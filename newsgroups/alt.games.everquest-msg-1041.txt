It's simple to test -- let the guy join, kill something, and see
if the level 20 gets a "You have gained party experience!" message or
not.  If so, he's getting exp, if not, the highest member of your group
is too high.

Even if he still gets exp, it's true that a much-higher group member
will suck a larger share of exp from the group than someone of the
same level would, BUT, they also often make it possible to kill things
higher (or faster) than you normally could, so it often balances out.
In the case you mention, the level 29 Cleric ought to make it possible
for you guys to fight faster, and fight harder creatures (and thus
get more exp per kill), offsetting the "exp sucking".

For this reason, I seldom obsess over the level distribution in my
groups, just as long as I'm getting some at all.
