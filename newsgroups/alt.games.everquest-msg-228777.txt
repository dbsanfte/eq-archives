Mages are a conjuring class.  Specializing in Evocation is stupid and 
illogical; like a cleric specializing in Divination.

I was -glad- to find that specializing in what any mage logically 
-should- specialize in was actually rewarded via this mechanism; my 
evocation based nukes suffer, but I can mod rod and pet canni and use 
the conjuration based line of nukes efficiently.

With this change, I'd appreciate a quest allowing me to change my 
specialization from conjuration to evocation without having to spend the 
several weeks of chain casting my lowest evoc nuke in order to get 
specialization back up to 200 in the now more sensible (if contrary to 
class description) line.

Not going to happen, of course, but I'd appreciate it.

Splendid
