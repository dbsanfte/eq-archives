Paladin does not get a stun with a damage component until L49 (I am 48).

Just last night I was able to peel Frost Giants off a L56 Ranger who was 
outdamaging me by at least 5:1, maybe more like 10:1, by using stuns. 
He'd get agro back quickly of course, dual wielding fast proc'ing 
weapons will do that, heh.  Very late in any particular fight I couldn't 
get agro off the Ranger unless I'd also thrown some GHeals, but I 
attribute that to the enormous difference between our damage output 
(easily over 1000hp difference between what he'd done and what I'd done 
by the time an Elite was down to 25%).

I have peeled mobs off every class, even when they were trying to hold 
agro.  I will say that Rangers and Shadowknights are the only classes 
that seem to be able to put up a good struggle over agro in my 
experience, if a Ranger or SK two or more levels higher than me wants to 
take/hold agro he'll usually succeed.  (Bards don't count, they cheat by 
agro'ing _way_ too many mobs at once, a determined Bard can walk away 
with all the adds by forcing me to work just to keep one mob's attention.)

As a side note, I had always assumed that the reason Enchanter DDs get 
so much agro is that they have a stun component (Chaotic Feedback I know 
for sure does a _very_ brief stun).
