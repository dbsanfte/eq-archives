And give warriors dopuble the amount of hit points, shouldn't be so
challenging.
May increasing the number of spells learnable by 1 every 10 levels would be
an idea but choosing the corect spells is half of the challenge for playing
a caster.
It enables you to stand upon your pedastals and tell us how simple it is to
play a tank in comparison.

This might be an idea.

Of course you could just not hit that button.

Hmm Does this happen to you in real life?

In role play terms;
Meditating requires concentration, the idea of the spell book is that you
are no longer distracted by the world outside your mind. When you reach a
sufficent proficiency you are able to do this while observing what is going
on around you. The same as when you start you can hold your concentration
while talking and listening to conversations, later sights will no longer
disturb you tantric state unless you want them two.

These things are there to make the game a challenge, of course if you don't
want that challenge then try this, when starting the game press square,
square, square, triangle, up, right shoulder, triangle and circle this will
enable infinite health and mana ;ï¿½P

This game requires very little in *manual* skill to play, but it does
require you to pay attention to what you are doing (not pressing the wrong
Hot Key) have good awareness and knowledge of your suroundings (like medding
or resting in safe places) and learn things the hard way (lets face that map
you down loaded will help a bit in finding your way back to your corpse but
it won't be to much help when you need to run to zone with half the dungeon
behind you)
Not to mention learning what works and what doesn't against certain mobs. ie
my Shaman partner doesn't bother memming any offensive spells for OT as,
without a tashani or similar debuff, they just resist to much, he'd rather
stick with buffs and heals then let the tank (my SK) and his pet deal the
damage. This way he is never low on mana as these spells cost very little to
cast in comparison.
