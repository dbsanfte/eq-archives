STA is far more important to a rogue than STR. Prep-Luclin Rogue gear
is really schmaltzy with it, too since its design was based on a bad
understanding by the designers as to what rogues DO.

Decent stats. Put all your points into STA and you'll be okay. STR
will rise cheaply.

I *love* my DE rogue and happily played her to 65 + 49. But, I had
been 65 for a long time before I started to be really happy with her
unbuffed STA.

Both of these races would make better 1hb weapons than rogues.
