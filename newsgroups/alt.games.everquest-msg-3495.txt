Nope :-)

My halfling druid hides all the time.  I just con something that is other
than
indifferent, and hide until it becomes indifferent.  Then I know that I can
med or go afk with no worry about camo running out.

Now if I'm medding in a dangerous place, and will be paying attention
the whole time, I will camo.  Hide is just a little bonus perk, like hiding
in
Nek when killing a guard.  If I wanna read a book while I med, Hide
is much better than camo, because I may not notice camo wear off.
Hide won't, because once you're hidden, you're hidden :-).
