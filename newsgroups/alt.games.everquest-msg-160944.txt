Perhaps so.  I'm not going to be using this computer for long enough to be 
worth the time investment of installing Mozilla, especially since I've never 
done that under SGI IRIX 6.5 and would probably need root access, which I 
don't have.  Perhaps you'd like to come do it for me?  Or would it be easier 
just not to refer people to unamusing things with ungodly popups without at 
least a warning?

'Just install X' is a great answer if you can safely assume that you're 
talking to someone who (a) uses the same computer all the time and (b) owns 
the computer in question.
