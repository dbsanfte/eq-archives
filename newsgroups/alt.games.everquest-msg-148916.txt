Huge difference.  The PL'd char still had the time, even it was less, to 
experience the first 20 levels.  The suggested 'pre-made' level 20 
character walks into the game when it's starting to get serious and has 
no clue what his or her role is.  PLing is a good way to get the 
annoying levels out of the way, IF it's done right.  If it's not done 
right, it's just as annoying as eBay chars.
