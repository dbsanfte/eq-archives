I'm trying to powerlevel a friend who's in his late 20's; i was hoping to
get him to 30 so he could make sow potions for me (i'm a druid but i have
other characters), and was having trouble finding a good place. I'd love to
root/dot/snare/zone and have him finish it off, without other players kill
stealing or freaking out when some red appears nearby (one guy was paranoid
he was being trained, despite the critter moving about slowly and having
about 100 hits left, because it kept spamming with "A critter detects you
and leaps to attack!" messages)

Any good zones for this? Luclin looks like a nightmare what with root/snare
immune creatures, and wolf form hating guards, but i'll try anywhere. I'm a
druid in mid 40's.
