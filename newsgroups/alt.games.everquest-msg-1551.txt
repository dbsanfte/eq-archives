I started playing EQ around 3 weeks ago.  That's a guess, I don't remember
the exact date.

I'm on a cable modem, and home network.  Until recently, I had been a
network admin, so I'm fairly confident that my network is ok.

Throughout the last week, I have been getting disconnected 2-3 times a
night.  In the first 2 weeks of playing, it never happened.

People I have been playing with have been complaining about the same thing.

This is obviously not a "random occurance", so I think we should all call
support and complain, no?
