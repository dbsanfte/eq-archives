I'm pretty sure the person meant " a way to tell when a friend gets
online in EQ when you ARE NOT", since he is asking if there is a
PROGRAM to do that.

Of course he could tell in game so I imagine that is what they mean.
The answer is "no, there is not." I wish there was too.. it would be
kind of neat if it sat there showing who in your friend list was in EQ
(like icq sort of) so you'd know whether or not logging in might be
worth it.
