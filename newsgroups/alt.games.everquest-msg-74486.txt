That would be the Deputy Tagil's Debt quest.  Talk to Uner Gnarltrunk
in the druid guild.  He'll start talking about how Deputy Tagil (one
of the guards in Misty Thicket at the Rivervale entrance) stepped on
his vegetables and forgot to pay for them.  Uner will give you a note
to give to Deputy Tagil.  When you give the note to Deputy Tagil, he
will give you a large gold coin which you give to Uner Gnarltrunk for
experience, a random item and faction boosts.
