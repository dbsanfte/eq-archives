Well Haabbes the human necro on Discord went into Nektulos, it turned out
the guards were only apprehensive. Got the one kill needed to ding 6, and
moved to a quiet corner. Killed a couple more db's, had been lvl6 for maybe
10 minutes total....and somebody's mez attempt bounced. Oh damn.

Spun around, saw lvl 9 chanter winding up for another try. Sent pet after
him and hightailed it for the EC zoneline. Chanter quickly got my pet mezzed
and set out after me. I resisted another mez attempt, then when I was only
steps from the zoneline we stuck one. But then nothing -- maybe he got
engaged by somebody else, who knows. I waited out the mez, zoned....and ran
directly into a PK duo. A troll and a dark elf, I never checked the classes
but the troll was either a SK or a BST, and the other was a cleric I think.
Anyway they killed me quick.

Well I like the impulse behind the server but I think I've had my taste for
now. Gonna wait to see if they adjust the ruleset for a second run.

I'd like them to keep the basic concept but change it so that PvP isn't
actually the point of the exercise it's just part of the challenge. Get rid
of the PK points. So for example they could make it a race to level up -- 
run the server for two months and the player who gets the farthest with each
class gets a prize (or first one to 50 in each class as the case may be).
PvP is allowed and hence part of the environment, but no prizes for PK
success. And they need to make a few fixes to limit train-griefing at least
in newbie areas (just delete trainable higher-level mobs from those zones,
like the drowned citizens in West Freeport).
