Christ, would you shut the hell up already? There was a threat made and her
account was threatened. Period. A threat doesn't necessarily mean it will be
carried out. I could threaten to shoot you and never do it, but would you
not call that a threat?

Even though Lokari's account wasn't in danger, the threat WAS STILL MADE.
