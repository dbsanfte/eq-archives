I was curious about focus effects. I have a wizard and the only focus
effect item I have is golden bracer (extended range 2). I am saving up
to buy a robe of tempest (increased damage 3). I saw some other items
like a back slot item and shoulder slot items that had increased
damage 2. Would it be a waste to wear those items while having an item
with the same focus effect of a higher value? Also, do these really
make a difference in play? A magician gave me a summoned opal bracelet
and it really added some damage to my nukes. It would be awesome to
beef up my nuke damage along with range and mana usage.
