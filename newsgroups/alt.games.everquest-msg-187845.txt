One of the great things about EQ is that it avoids Diablo syndrome. Diablo 
syndrome is where you start playing and an hour later you have a magical 
sword and maybe a decent piece of armor. After a week you have no idea what 
you are going to spend your money on, aside from the disgustingly 
overpriced vendor gear.

Enjoy being poor- I know it sounds stupid but enjoy it :)
