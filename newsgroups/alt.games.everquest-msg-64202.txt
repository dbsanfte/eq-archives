Long before they were on time they had a really bad habit of blowing the ETA
by 1.5.  They claim 4 hours, then it'd be 6.  They claim 8, then it'd be 12.
AND THIS IS ON REGULAR PATCHES.

Now, for quite some time now regular patches have been on time, or close to
it.

This is not a regular patch, give 'em a break.
