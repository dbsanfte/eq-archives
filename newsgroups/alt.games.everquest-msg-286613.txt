Going back to the original point, and not worrying about whether WoW
in particular  is less or more buggy than other games... the argument
that "all games have bugs, therefore don't complain about them" is
nonsense.  Yes all games have bugs, no all games do NOT have the same
magnitude of bugs.  You yourself cite reasons why different games have
different numbers of bugs.  

As far as having played a lot of games... I played EQ for 6 years, WoW
since a few weeks after release, EQ2 for about 4 months, Guild Wars
for a few months, LOTRO beta, a bit of Auto Assault beta, etc.  My
wife has played all of the above plus SWG (more hours than I want to
think about) a variety of other MMOs and MUDs going back to 300 baud
dialup modems.  When she says a game is buggy, I trust her.  So please
don't imagine that you're going to impress me with your vast MMO
experience.
