Ok.

Which question? The viewport or the Vah Shir models? I'm presuming you 
mean the viewport. It was a legitimate question if that's it.

Like I said if it's the viewport options my question was legitimate. I 
don't suffer from those problems and I sympathize with those who do. It

legitimate reason why they would put it in.
