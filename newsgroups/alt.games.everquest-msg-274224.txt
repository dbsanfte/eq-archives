I don't envy GMs that have to deal with such erm...language! I didn't
even recognized it unless you've shown me what it should mean!

Even though english isn't my native tongue I just cringe at this way to
rape a language. I needed some time to realize this but well written
sentences are a work of art in itself. And I just can hope that this
"elite" speak will die as soon as possible.
