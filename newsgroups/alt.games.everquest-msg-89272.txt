Marus is a GREAT zone.  Lots of stuff to kill.

My monk went there at 28, and stayed until 34.  There was still stuff to
kill, but I was getting bored and started my shackle quests.

I found that I got great exp killing the stonegrabbers.  Nothing will assist
them (except other stonegrabbers), and they won't aggro on you.

Hoppers are the same way, but there are hoppers all over the place and they
have a large aggro radius, so I tended to leave them alone when soloing.

The zelniaks and lightcrawlers will aggro on you from fairly far away, and
the lightcrawlers run a SoW speed.  If you don't feel like wasting time
killing a green zelniak, the Recuso's will attack them.  I trained the
Recuso camp a lot.

Only problem with the zone is that the loot is almost nonexistent.
