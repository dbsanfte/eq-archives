No, the pet could sit there and fight the mobs without aggroing others if he
wanted to.  If I am in an LDoN group that is ancy about getting adds, I will
pet pull and can single pull from rooms of 5 and 6 every time.

I being a necromancer dont have Spirit Call, but I think that it works like
Wake the Dead.  WtD aggros the target mob when the spell is cast, not when
the pet gets to the mob, which isn't true of regular pets or even wizard
swords.

To be honest, no.  Some places PoP level pets will work fine (Ssra for
example) others they won't (LDoN).  I haven't done much testing as to which
pet will work where.  Though if some people want to try it in variuos places
I'd like to hear your results.
