Bah, you guys are way too non-paranoid. Trust a single guy to OK the
source? Ok, if Johnjackson@yahoo.com releases the source to a program
and Jackjohnson@yahoo.com greenlights it, it's safe?

But that's not true either. Take this scenario: John Jackson's Frobnitz
for Everquest gets released with source, and many people check both
source and binaries for backdoors or other malicious code. A few
updates down the road, you read on John's webpage that a new version
has been released, but that, due to time constraints, the source
package will be released a few days later. You've gotten to know and
trust Jack, so you download a binary filled with Bad Stuff.

Or, even more nefarious: John Jackson develops a closed-source C
compiler, complete with functions to insert malicious code into
programs with a certain name or with a certain comment included in the
source. He then releases the source, seemingly legit, under a
pseudonym, and instructs users to compile it with his C compiler. The
compiler then adds all kinds of backdoors to the source code at
compile time.

Think that was outlandish? It actually happened, IIRC, on early UNIX
systems. Whenever someone compiled the login program, the C compiler
would add a backdoor to it, and, even worse, if you recompiled the
compiler, it would add the code necessary to make the new compiler
add that backdoor to the login routines, too.[1]

Please note that I am not implying that the OP has included any Bad
Stuff in his program, and I have no reason to believe that he has.
