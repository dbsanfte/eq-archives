Not disagreeing it would be easier with a 9 person group but I was
wondering how unbalanced it would get....

Yes but its still split, you still can get a bunch of groups all working
in on it and a continuous stream of yellows and reds becomes trivial
uunder raid - yes some will benefit more because of the different split 
but the rate is going to be such that if you get involved your xp is
already going to trundle up rapidly....with an epic night last night I got
involved with 2 mobs and got a blue bub of xp - a grand total of about 3
minutes fighting - if we had been xping en masse we'd have been cruising
on and on and on.....and you can have as many people as you want in the
groups...
