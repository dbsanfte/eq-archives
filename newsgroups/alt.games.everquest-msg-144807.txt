If all you are interested in is a Bazaar shopping mule that can quickly meet
up with your main, there's a quicker way than making a Druid and leveling up
to 19.

Make a Bard, and level up to 5 to get Selo's.  Go ahead and keep leveling,
but there is no hurry, and don't go past level 10.  Take the Bard to Luclin
and bind in Shadowhaven.

When the Bard needs to meet up with your main, the Bard can whichever Nexus
port down goes nearest where your main is.  Average wait: only 8 minutes.
If that turns out to be NK because your main is over in the Freeport area,
no problem.  A Bard with Selo's can make the trip from NK to the Freeport
area pretty easily (if you don't get lost in Runnyeye and take longer to get
through than Selo's stays up, since Runnyeye is indoors so Selo's won't keep
pulsing there).

To go back to the Nexus...die.  The Bard is under 11, so doesn't leave items
on the corpse, so anything the Bard was carrying that was not part of the
delivery (e.g., drums to make Selo's faster, or anything you've given the
Bard to go sell) will go with him.
