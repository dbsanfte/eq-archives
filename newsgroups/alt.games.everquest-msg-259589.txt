my new asus mb wouldn't run the old g3 card.  I think it's only 8x and
the g3 was a 4x.  
But aside from that I did figure out the problem.  somewhere in the
upgrade my monitor went from the viewsonic VG150 to Generic VGA.
changing it back fixed the this problem!  
one of those oh yeah things.  

Thanks again for all the help that everyone provides.
