In my experience, any time SOE has discovered a situation where you could
sell a tradeskilled item back to a merchant for more plats than the
component ingredients cost, without risk, they quickly moved in and nerfed
it fiercely. I think their reasoning is that they didn't want to allow any
sort of guaranteed infinite plat generation machines. They know the player
base -- if anything like this existed you would see thousands of players who
would do nothing but grind out plats all day long.

Btw, does anyone remember the pottery fiasco a few years ago? There was a
major change in tradeskills and pottery was significantly affected, causing
many of the prices for components and buy-back prices to change. These
changes were introduced on Test where some clever guy noticed that one end
of a common transaction was changing without the other (I forget if it was
the component cost or the NPC buy-back price). The result was that a few
individuals who saw this coming loaded up their bank and personal
inventories with as many stacks of the components as they could buy the day
before the change went live. The next day when the change went live, they
then sold all these back at a huge profit. The net result was that anyone
doing this netted serious tons of plats. I'm sure that SOE specifically
watch for these kind of changes now...
