Necromancers and Druids are the best soloers hands down. I was able to
pretty much solo a warrior to level 35, but it was hard, slow going.
Warriors are really a "group" char.

Fairly important, but pretty much any mistakes you make in creration can be
overcome with gear.

You have to run everywhere, only Druids and Wizards can port, but you can
pay them to port you where you need to go.

There are tons of them.

The first 25 or so levels are a snap.

 AC has some

EQ has very nice dungeons, some are very dangerous, some are easy. The same
here for map sites, there are lots.

You may want to do some indepth reading about EQ vs AC. The BIG difference
is that when you die in EQ you return to your bind point, minus a bit of
experiance and naked, no gear. You must now go back to where you died and
find your corpse and loot it. At low level (under 6) you have very little
time to do this, like 5 minutes.
