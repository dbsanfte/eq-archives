Well, my decision to go guildless for a while is suddenly showing
its downside.  I'm at the stage in my shaman's epic where I
actually need a raid force, or at least a high powered group; I
need to go to fear and kill a level one mob to loot a tear... but
to get that mob up, one of the mini-bosses has to die.  While the
non DT one might be single group killable, the others
realistically aren't, and either way there's substantial clearing
to do first.

Ideally, I'd like to join a raid on Fear that doesn't have a
shaman in need of the tear, and thus come by it honestly.

But how to find such a raid?

I recall in various guilds I've been in that people would say
things like "fear is booked" when looking for something to do.  I
assume from this that there's some public web page where such
information is posted regularly, but my rudimentary web browsing
skills have yeilded nothing; I see a lot of calendar featuring
the subartic tundra of northern europe, I see some things for
Cazic Thule, I even see some posts by a guy on a totally
different game who happens to have his Morel Thule based EQ
character in his sig file... but nothing on what I'm looking for.
