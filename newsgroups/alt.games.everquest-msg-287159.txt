Here's a sneak peek at the Game Update Notes for Wednesday December 12th 
(Please note that these notes may or may not be changed before the 
servers open back up):

*** Items ***

- Retuned portions of the "Tinmyn's Oil Can" task to be more in line 
with the reward.
- The enchant Palladium and Dwerium scrolls will do more checks before 
allowing you to scribe them.
- Increased the drop rates of the "global" Rank 2 spell drops in Secrets 
of Faydwer zones.
- Removed parry focus from several items when no classes could use it. 
It will remain on any items where some classes can use the effect.


*** Quests & Events ***

- Fixed an issue with the Golems in Crystallos that would sometimes have 
them hitting too hard.
- Increased the number of items that drop from the raids in Meldrath's 
Progression Quest from 6 to 12.
- Gridbar Galund will no longer eat items given to him allowing warriors 
to continue along their epic quest line.
- Fixed an issue with the Shaman Epic in West Freeport. Talking to the 
greater spirit should work now.


*** NPC ***

- The respawn time on Shei Vinitras has been changed to be persistent 
through server downs instead of having her spawn up to a day after the 
zone comes up.
- Increased the respawn time of Meldrath's Majestic Mansion's base 
population.
- The shadows created for the tradeskill quest in hills of shade should 
now be less dangerous to the rest of the zone.
- Increased the respawn time (time between NPC respawns) in many SoF zones.
- Merchant Sele has set up shop in Shar Vahl and sells some tailoring 
supplies found in other home cities.
- Increased the power of the pets summoned by the beastlord spell Howl 
at the Moon.


*** Tradeskills ***

- Cultural metal drops have been adjusted to drop in the proper content now.
- The level 60 to 64 spell parchments should now be properly dropping.
- Legacy Shimmering Nihilite will no longer twist the tools when it is cut.
- Eron now give the rewards for his quest in a less confusing manner.
- Elegant charms have had some mod effects added.
- Fixed a bug with the Elegant charm that prevented it from gaining 
stats properly from elegant armor.
- Fixed the naming issue with Legacy Pale Nihilite Recipes.
- The new shimmering Nihilite can now be used to make the old weapon 
components.
- Legacy pale nihilite can be cut the same way as crimson nihilite. This 
gemstone will undergo an odd transition from the cutting and turn 
crimson in color.
- The thickener needed to make enchant metal spells via spell research 
has been changed to invigorating thickener.
- High level humanoids no longer value tin and ruined pelts. Instead 
they value titanium and flawless animal pelts like they should have.


*** Tasks ***

- The quest to save the scout clockwork in the guardian has been updated 
to update the whole group. Because of this, the scout will now only 
repop at the rate of other NPC's in the zone, instead of the five minute 
repop he was on.


*** AA ***

- Removed the Mana cost from the Call Hither AA.
- Additional ranks of the Druid AA Nature's Boon should increase in 
healing as the description states.
- Origin and Silent Presence are no longer on the same timer.
- Fixed a number of text and description issues.
- Set all ranks of Steady Hands and Burst of Power to ignore delevel 
(IE: You keep the value of the AA if you lose the level you need to 
purchase the AA) to be consistent with other AAs that raise skill caps.
- Shaman were incorrectly left off the AA Hastened Call of the Wild and 
this has been fixed.
- The AA Foraging will now not be revoked if you fall below the level 
needed to purchase the AA.
- Modified the timers for Arcane Whisper and Fortify Companion so that 
they do not conflict.
