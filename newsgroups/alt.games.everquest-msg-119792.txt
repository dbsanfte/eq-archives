Here is one easy way to raise faction :
There is a guy hiding behind the magicians/wizards/whatever buildings. He
asks if you wanna see his most wonderfull spell. Then he says he needs the
components, which are 2 rat whiskers, one batwing and one snake scales (or
something approching).
Buy this junk by the newbie merchants (stuff several backbacks). Do the
quest.
My Barbarian Warrior, who couldn't buy from the spell casters merchants,
went to amiably in no time, just with this newbie quest.
