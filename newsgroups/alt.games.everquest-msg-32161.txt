    The seventh shawl is as good an item as many people could ever hope to
get in EQ, considering the requirements. AC 7 WIS 7 INT 7 CHA 7 STA 7 Sv.
Fire Poison Cold 7 alone would beat the Ad Eps - 21 points of resists AND 21
HPs at level 60 in exchange for 3 AC net? Then add in Flowing Thought: 1, a
half-Breeze, and the Ad Eps look really inadequate. I'm on shawl five now,
starting to grind XP and threads in Velk's, and I'd recommend the quest to
anyone who has any tolerance for doing trade skills.
