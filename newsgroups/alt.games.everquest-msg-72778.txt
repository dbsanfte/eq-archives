In a group, it is much less than that, more along the lines of 1% or
so, as I recall reading.  Solo is where you can get the 50% whammy.
This is what I recall reading from the folks running ShowEQ, my

"No one has the answer, but one thing is true
You've got to turn on evil, when it's coming after you
You've got to face it down, and when it tries to hide
You've got to go in after it, and never be denied
Time is running out
Let's roll" - Neil Young, "Let's Roll"
