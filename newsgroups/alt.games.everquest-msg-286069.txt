I just read through all the posts, and I didnt see anyone who claims to be a 
wow player, so Im not sure where you get that one from.
I was just having a dig at the fanbois who tell everyone to leave, and then 
get their wish ... in spades.

As someone else pointed out, this is happening in WOW too, which I think is 
probably losing more people than its gaining right now.
