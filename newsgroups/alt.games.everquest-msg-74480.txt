Hi,

A few weeks ago I asked a question in this newsgroup about the extreme
amount of noise that my Mother's new 1.6GHz Dell computer was making.

Several kind people from this newsgroup replied, and suggested that the
amount of sound which I was describing did not seem to be normal.

So as many of you advised, we contacted Dell tech support, and they sent
someone out who replaced the CPU cooling fan.

And I am happy to report that since changing the fan my Mother's system
is running VERY quietly now!!  Many Thanks for the advice.  It is quite
remarkable actually, the huge amount of difference it has made.

It's like the difference between night and day!  It is a whisper quiet
system now.

I was told that many of the fans that Dell recently shipped are extremely
noisy ones.  And that they are getting lots of calls to replace them with
the newer and much quieter type fans.

After my Mother got her fan replaced, and I heard the difference I also got
mine done as well!  (I had ordered my new Dell system shortly after she did)

So, we both Thank You for your help!!

Best Regards,

 - Mike Dorr
