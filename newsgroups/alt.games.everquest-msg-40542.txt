    It is. First you need to get in a group - no easy task. Then you need to
sit, and sit, and sit. Take Spiders in Velk's - you'll usually get one quest
gem drop per hour. No cash off spiders, and unless you're in two of the five
camps you have no chance at a rare spawn, just a random rare drop that seems
to drop at about one per eight hours. In the camps with rare spawns, you
have roughly one spawn per two hours. That's hardly Candyland. The closest
I've seen to a Candyland environment is Crypt in Sebilis - 7 rare spawn
points (if you're doing C/E/B, Emperor requires a high-level to single
pull). But you have to get that group, have C/E/B be open, and be willing to
sit down there a LONG time to reap the rewards.

    That's the problem - they spend on other things. Chip in for Peridots
for raids, pay for port stones to the planes, purchase gems for quest armour
drops, buy a full set of Blue Diamond jewelry - a high level player that has
an active raid schedule has a lot of expenses, and a lot of what they win is
No Drop and can't be sold to recoup losses. Or is considered "guild only"
and can't be sold.

    My reward is to have a greater variety of option available. If I feel
that sitting killing a "no XP green" helps me, then I can do it. That is why
I played. To be able to do more, not less.

    You'd think so - but truth is, a lot of the raid experience is pretty
damn boring. And don't even get me started on the tedium that is farming ToV
for armour drops.

    And under TCC, they can interact with content that I cannot. That,
unless I ran all around the world at a young age, I will never get to
interact with. So again - am I meant to be penalized?

    And they get to obtain the items I cannot.

    Which do less to the foes I face than his do to his foes (excepting
percentile effects like slowdowns). It doesn't matter if I can nuke for 1 K
damage if my foes all have 32 K HPs.
