Subject: LOIO blues and greens... do they seem harder than normal to anyone?

I've noticed that my level 24 ranger and level 23 shaman really have to WORK to
kill alot of blue / green critters in LOIO and I get experience from MOST of
the greens.  
I won't even TRY a white unless my partner's on.  Anyone else notice this or is
it just US?
