I swear,sometimes its not possible to pacify in Tak,but
I have learned my lesson,we changed tactics a little,so
my SK partner will now go ahead and I assist him to 
pacify,having Kei dispelled or being mezzed (Holgreshs
in EF) as a cleric is devastasting to the group;better a tank
type gets initial aggro than the healer.
