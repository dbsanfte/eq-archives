A certain guild on Prexus (with SOE EQ devs as members) recently had a
massive profile player ebay...  basically their number 2 class person, it
all got very messy... some HARSH flamings on the boards, but when push came
to shove the account was sold, moved to SH and renamed.

Game devs (incl a head) knew without doubt what was happening but apparantly
no action was taken...  quite sad really

Btw heres a very amusing ebay post

But before you click it, heres some background...

Stasis had a wizard, his name was Trabius and most ppl thought he was a
dick.
He whined about loot, then deguilded immediatly after getting a big item,
and joined the local uber guild (KtF)

Heres his story since joining the new guild

Refusing to answer? :)
