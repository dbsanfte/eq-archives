This is a great suggestion in regards to fighting the flies.  I'm very
familiar with swarm kiting.  I solo with charm swarm kiting.  I
usually manage a pack of six to eight mobs.  I think my exp per hour
is on the low end because the mobs I'm swarming are probably low dark
blue to me.  I never fight light blues.  I'm not too familiar with PoD
other than the first area near that pond that is close to the zone
line.  I'll have to adventure out a bit to find these flies.  I guess
I'm fighting the wrong mobs for my level to get a decent rate of
experience per hour.  I'm impressed that you were getting two yellow
bubbles an hour before you hit 51.  I tried everything to get more
than a yellow per hour.  When I swarm kited, I'd slap a few DoT's on
my pet before I charmed him so he'd die even faster when I sent him to
fight the other mobs.  I did this with the Rockhoppers

Since you have a level 57 bard, where did you hunt between levels
52-57 when you soloed?  What mobs?  How many mobs do you pull in a
typical swarm when using charm?
