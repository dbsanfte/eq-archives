I was living in Brazil and met a group of missionaries who'd come down
there to preach. For the most part, they weren't targeting practicing
Catholics, but rather people who had little or no faith. Despite the
fact that Brazil is close to 100% Catholic, very few people go to
church or are even remotely religious (IME.)

I still thought they were a pain in the ass, but thought I would set
the record straight.
