Not melee, Warriors *specifically*.

Sorry to break it to you but a Warrior with dual Lamentations and FBSS
needs more than WR putting him near the haste cap to help him hold aggro.
If the 'chanter has mezzed the mob and slowed it while mezzed [or had a
couple of resisted slows pre-mez] and our hypothetical Warrior comes over
and makes an arse of breaking mez (hits taunt twice and then attacks or
whatever) then he doesn't have a BoC/Epic  etc whatever to proc and make it
look like he did ok before mob reaches the 'chanter.

SK/Pal with sub-par gear can mitigate somewhat through stun/root/debuffs.
Ghetto_Warrior cannot.  Just like he doesn't have the DPS to maintain aggro
off the Rogue/Monk/Ranger wielding better weapons and doing 20-50% more
damage and constantly taking damage when the mob turns to them.
