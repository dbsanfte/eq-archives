Before level 51, paladins, shadowknights, and bards are all on the same 
damage table as warriors, and always have been. This patch, we changed 
it so that they remain on the same table all the way up to level 60. 
Just to make sure this is clear, here is a list of classes-

Pre-level 51 there are two damage tables, the "standard table" and the 
"high damage table"
1-50 Standard Table - Warrior, Rogue, Paladin, Shadowknight, Ranger, Bard
1-50 High Damage Table - Monk

Before this patch when characters hit level 51, some of them would move 
to a higher table. This is how things were prior to this latest melee patch.
51+ Standard Table - Paladin, Shadowknight, Bard
51+ High Damage Table - Monk, Warrior, Rogue, Ranger

With this patch, we added two new totally new damage tables, and moved 
classes around a bit. Here is how things are on live servers right now-
51+ Standard Table - No one.
51+ High Damage Table - Warrior, Rogue, Ranger, Paladin, Shadowknight, Bard
55+ Monk Table - Monk
60+ Monk Table - Monk

Also, please note that damage tables are not always a big damage 
increase. Moving from the standard table to the high damage table is a 
fairly large increase, but moving from the high damage table to the 55+ 
monk table is only a small increase.

Another important thing to know about damage tables is this - they only 
affect the amount of damage you do. Damage tables do not affect the 
chance to hit or miss a monster, your weapon skills, or anything except 
the amount of damage you do. Damage tables specifically affect your 
average damage per hit and how high your hardest hits can be.

There's additional info there about damage bonuses and etc.
