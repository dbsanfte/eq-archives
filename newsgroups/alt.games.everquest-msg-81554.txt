Well, we had a crappy turnout last night (55ish people, only 30 or so level
60)  We had a few issues with some other guilds trying to get in our way,
anyway we pulled Tormy and he dropped easily enough.

Next vindi, pwnt as usual.  Statue - duel wielding, our only deaths were on
enrage (sploilt our flawless victory heh)

We stepped up into Arena, buffed and got ready for AoW.  For some reason a
60 cleric died on inc (guess she didn't stand up or something) to put it
bluntly, we got our asses handed to us.

We didn't really learn anything from it,  we didn't even take 10% off his HP
before wipeout.

Lag was really really bad yesterday (50 people making the lag 100 people
would make - 10 people went LD just on tormax), and we were missing at least
35 level 60 people, including 8 or so clerics... even with all those there
though, he wouldn't have dropped.

It would have been fun to see how well we could do with our proper clerics
there (we had 4 guild clerics, 1 non guildie, and 1 of those who died on the
pull)

Btw I lasted about 5 seconds after all the tanks died, when he summoned me
(4/5 hits, with 4250ish hp, 1200ishac)

Ah well, all good fun :)
