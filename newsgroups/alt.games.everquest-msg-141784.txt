Heh the imperial federal goverment stole at gunpoint about half of what I
made today so I guess I am an expert and get to comment.

The recording industry is seriously whacked atm. It takes nothing more than
going to your local kmart,target, etcetra and looking at the prices of
movies and cds. Why does a movie which involves such an extreme amount of
work cost less than many music cds? Why does every time the music industry
tries to crack down on pirarcy do their sales DECREASE?

Lol look at what they are asking for too. It is the equivalent of asking the
DOT to force construction companies to tear up all roads leading to nevada
since it will soon be legal to buy pot there and buying pot is BAD.
