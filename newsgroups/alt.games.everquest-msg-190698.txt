}Once again, with how much you've "been told."
}Not even a 65 druid from Meemer's guild can solo the druid epic.
}They can probably solo everything up to Ullump, VSR and Faydear, but in none
}of those zones is there anything charmable that a druid can use as a pet.

So... what's the minimum reasonable force to take on VSR (or VS, for that 
matter) these days, assuming not extremely uber folks (say... 20-odd AA, 
over level 61, but never been to vex thal or NToV).

Think it could be done with one healer, one tank, one slower?
