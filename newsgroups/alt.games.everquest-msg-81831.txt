The only tricky part is getting from FV docks to loio. The run through FV is
quite dangerous. Drachnids are kos, about lvl 35, run at sow speeds, cast,
and some see invisible. Keep to the zone wall, and have invis up. Id bind in
loio. When you get your ring spells at lvl 19, you can can bank in
kelethin/tox and gate back to loio, thus avoiding fv and drachnids. Just
remember to take ring of commons with you when you go. (so you can ring to
commons and buy the rest of your ring spells at 19)
Id recommend hunting around the windmill at level 18. Thats in the SE corner
of zone. mobs in most other areas will be too hard for you yet.
When you hit 29 you will probably want to go to either FM (at tthe giant
fort most likely) or OT.
