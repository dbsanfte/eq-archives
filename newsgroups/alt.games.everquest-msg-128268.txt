Didn't miss any of that.  Just wanted to point out the buyer is being
offered an free account but the seller explicitly said he isn't
selling the characters.  He makes a big point of the fact he's
offering the account free as he tries to defend himself, but he never
promises you'd get the characters.  

You won't talk scum out of being scum.  But some scum is more slippery
than others.
