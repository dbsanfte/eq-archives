I want to work out what I do the more damage with, my Lance or DW
Fleshgrinder and A.N.Other. I feel I do more with the Lance but that might
be my imagination.
Was going to use Xylobot but any recommendation on what level mobs would be
best to test on (at 55 was thinking of using Expedition guards in GD, lvl50
non-summoning) or any suggestions of other parsers to try?

Also;

Sometime ago someone posted a link to an EQ Character Art site, I believe it
was in a thread about fan fiction, I am having no luck finding the post on
google, does anyone remember the post or the site? All I can tell you about
it is that they used EQ screen shots as the basis and offered the pictures
on various media (mugs, mousemats etc) oh, and it wasn't dragonart.
