    Well, at least they managed to figure out how to make them permanent!

    Boooo! Not only is scarecrow form loads of fun, but the faction thing
was neat. I pulled corpses from the back of CoD after one near-wipeout while
in scarecrow form, and our enchanters could wander the entire dungeon in it.
Yeah, I know - "blah blah skipping content blah blah trivializing blah".
Guess now I'll just have to use the cleric method of walking from one end of
CoD to the other. ;-)

    BSTs were getting level 30's and 40's vendor spells. I really, really
hope that's fixed.

    They changed an item I have - I feel special now!

    I still have to find my favourite gnome tinker and staple him to the
ground while he makes me a set of these. Mortar and Pestle is a great
addition.

    Making sure that the more craptastic ones will not be made by anyone.
Although I will admit, some of the pieces have good stats for the casual
player that needs to fill a weak slot. It's the tailored stuff and smithed
stuff that has the real problems.

    HUZZAH! HUZZAH! HUZZAH!

    Hopefully it'll pick up the /anon ones, too. You can't hide from the
raid any more, bwahahahaha! (An old hobby of mine was to run around just
before a raid, find /anon guild members, and ask them in /gu, "Howdy
Soandso! Are you coming to the raid too?")

    It's very easy now. /ttell "Lose the horse", then give them the stuff!

    Now that's neat. I think the best piece of programming in the game right
now has to be the Bazaar, in terms of usefulness and reliability. There's
just a few odd bits, like Cobalt Helms and Vambraces showing up when you do
a search for 1HS....

    WOOT! I'm not sure why they limit the size of a raid - maybe they're
worried about zerg hordes all getting flagged at once. But any increase is
welcome to a guild that can have as many people show up as mine. (150 mains,
usually 60 on for a raid, tapers to 45 by late PST.) I have to wonder how
much XP we're going to get now!

    So stop using SneakyAmp! I won't use it, in all likelihood, because I'm
not a big MP3 person and I love the new PoP music, but a bunch of my
guildmates are going to love this. Ok, maybe I'll cue up a clip of Fat
Bastard talking about how unloved he was when we kill Grummus.

    Good. That was annoying.

    Profits have just gone up, and sales of rockhopper pickles in The Bazaar
have dropped by a large margin!

    So the Skyshrine update is finally going live. Cool - it's about time
that zone was fleshed out more.

    Wonder what the unannounced changes will be - time to check the guild
board!
