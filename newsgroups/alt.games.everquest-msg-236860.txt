And its not very popular at the moment, due to the rate of expansion
not appearing to support the liklikhood of a future a crunch.

Not quite. Such a dimension 'above and beyond time' would still be
part of our universe the way you describe it, and it presumably would
collapse with all the others local dimensions during the crunch. What
I suspect he means, and what I did mean is time as independant from
our universe. As in our entire universe encased within another one, as
a hypothetical point of view at least from which to observe and
describe a sequence our universe cycling in time.

Only if he's working from 'inside' the universe, I think its safe to
argue that he's looking at the cycles from outside.
