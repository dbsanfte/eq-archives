While your gender is irrelevant to this question, your race -is-
relevant.  Funny how Real World pay scale uses exactly the
opposite approach, isn't it?

OK, not highly relevant, since you are hunting in GFay, there are
no Woodie mages, so you are almost certainly a Milkie.

I had a lot of trouble like you are having getting Gnomage armor
on the Firiona Vie server.  While I don't have any specific
answers to your problem, I can say that there were a lot more of
the drops I needed on higher level versions of the same mobs in
Steamfont; killing the little cats over in the tiny newbie area
didn't work nearly as well as their bigger level 10ish brothers
over near the windmill, so on and so forth.  I think that the
quests are designed to be completed either in groups where the
different people want different items off the same mobs, or so
that you have to keep hunting when the mobs are green; I just
don't see how its possible to get all the drops you'd need
without one or the other, exp is too easy to come by.  On Firiona
Vie, many of the items don't drop once the mobs are green, so its
a real scramble to get the whole kit complete if you want to do
that as a challenge.

Splendid One

Still wearing his full set of Collective armor at level 40!
