Well, if it is time to bitch about how easy Beastlords have it...then lets
not overlook the Beastlord epic.  Unless I missed something when I read the
walkthrough, almost everything you have to kill is either a common spawn or
is triggered, and most of them just need one reasonable group to kill--none
of that "assemble a raid force and then find out the mob is not available"
crap that many other classes have to put up with.
