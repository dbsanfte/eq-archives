lol getting to WW isn't tough.. port to CS, take a 2 minute run to SG, then
either succor across SG (10 seconds), self succor.. or take a 15 second
run.. and your in WW

Farming ST is a pain though, having to kill the same 3 mobs every 2 days,
starting at 8am est or so just to beat the other guilds, no real mob
variation, no different start for pulling/killing any mobs

Well the cowl is pretty nice too.. of course you could be really unlucky,
and end up with 2 pairs of gaunts (happened to us before heh)

I'd say Kland is on a par with Zland too, in terms of ease/racing to kill (I
know Kland is tougher, but several guilds are capable of both.. and neither
stay up long) wheras Sontalak was up the whole weekend while we were in nToV
