If you have the means to temporarily LAN the two computers together,
just copy your entire eq directory onto the new machine. I did it. You
don't even need to do much else. The program is amazing portable and all
self contained in one neat little folder. (Ok...... it's not "little"
and you can go get a coffee while it copies, but it will work.)
