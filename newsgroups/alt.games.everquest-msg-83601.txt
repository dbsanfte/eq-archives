I always rather wondered why EQ's EULA wasn't like Asheron's Call's EULA on
this.  Fact is, it's legally sticky having minors using this sort of online
environment.  Asheron's Call deals with this by banning accounts used by
minors.  Period.

I think it's a good idea.  Then again, I have a strong preference for people
who can spell, use complete sentences, and behave themselves. . .
