After reading this group for a bit I keep expecting every tell from a low
level player to be a beg. So far that is not the case. On those rare
occasions when I am in a newbie zone and somebody asks if I can help them
the request has been polite and fair.
The other day while passing through Qeynos I got a tell, "Can you help me?"
I do a /who and it's a level 4 mage. I reply "How can I help you?". Ok I
think, here comes the beg. "Can you tell me where to buy malachite in this
zone?". Coincidently that was exactly what I was trying to figure out at the
time too. I tell her that as soon as I figure it out I'll let her know. She
says "Ok, I'll tell you if I find it too".
Turns out she finds it first, sends me a tell and we meet there. She goes
first, and says "These things are way expensive". I chuckle to myself
remembering when I too thought they were expensive. They cost about 5sp
each. I look at my 100pp pocket money, I open up the vendor, buy three
stacks of malachite and put one stack in a trade window for her. She doesn't
do anything. I say "here, take it", "free, go ahead". Finally she says
"Really? Free?" and takes the malachite.
I figured it was only fair. When's the last time a level 4 newbie helped a
level 28 find something?

There's a lot of jerks and idiots in the game, but there's a lot more people
that are honorable and decent.
