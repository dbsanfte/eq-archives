March 6th 2003

I got this from The Caster's Realm.  And I thought some of you might
find it interesting it's a long read but a good one.

Sony calls their most recent addition to EQ on the PC merely an
�extension� but with the amount of features that it comes with it
comes very close to a full blown expansion. 

The extension was the first ever to be digitally distributed and with
over 200,000 sent on the opening day has proven to be a very popular
product with existing customers expected to sell close to a 1:1 ratio
for account holders over the next 3 months. 

The grand experiment� 

In many ways LoY was experimental for the development team. There were
a number of new elements from previous expansions. First of all this
was a digital distribution so how big could they make it? How many
zones could they squeeze out in the 200 � 300 125 megs allocated for
content. In the end there was a lot which came out, just some of the
new content included: 

5 new zones 
New playable race: Frogloks 
Looking For Group system 
Cartography system 
NPC Journal System 
Expanded Bank System 
Armor Dyeing 
Guild Management System 
New Dynamic Items: Charms 
That said don�t expect all future additions to the game to be digital
extensions. Rod Humble explained that it merely depends on the size of
the addition. If its under 300 � 350 Mb�s then it will probably be
digital, anything over that will warrant a CD and a box on the store
shelf. 

Armor Tinting � The Impossible Dream? 

Previously it had been thought impossible to offer armor tinting to
players due to the rigid design of the item database system. The new
system works by overlaying a tint on top of the model and existing
item to generate the new colors. This way the �dye� doesn�t attach to
a specific item but to a region of the body so that future items put
in that slot will assume the same color. 

The development team stated that the tinting was originally going to
be for high level characters to retain a unique high level appearance.
In the end however it was decided to allow all players who could
afford the components the ability to tint their armor. 

The high level players haven�t been forgotten though and brand new art
is in development for new items, armors and appearances later in the
year. 

But what about that Global Memory? 

Global Memory is always an issue for EverQuest. The Global Memory
determines the minimum requirements for the game so the development
team is always being very careful with every single patch to ensure
that any increase in the Global Memory usage is really worth it. Often
code is reworked many times to break it down to the most efficient
level for memory consumption. 

The new additions to the game with Legacy of Ykesha did increase the
amount of memory used with the game, but many of the major new memory
additions can be disabled if necessary through the option menu to
retain playability for older systems. 

The new kids on the block? 

So is EverQuest going to be able to survive with the oncoming
onslaught of MMOG titles such as Star Wars Galaxies or EverQuest 2?
The team certainly thinks so and they have no plans to abandon the
most popular MMORPG in the North American market. 

�A number of elements will connect EQ to both EQOA and EQ2�� says Rod
Humble, Executive Producer of EverQuest, �We�re going to be building
EQ2 to have a slightly different appeal so that those who might not
have found exactly what they were looking for with EverQuest can try
the EQ2 world instead. That being said we have no plans to stop
developing EQ, it�s continuing to grow after four years on the market
and is only improving with time. We�re still committed to EQ and you
can expect plenty of new things with it as time goes on.� 

So is it for me? 

The Legacy of Ykesha extension was aimed for people who perhaps didn�t
get as much out of Planes of Power as the upper tier gamers. The team
admits high level challenging content was needed, but with the average
level of their 11 Million + characters still 45 � 55 there�s a lot of
people looking for something new and exciting to do other than slay
the Gods. 

Scott Hartsman, Technical Director of EverQuest, and Rich Waters, Lead
Director of EverQuest, explain: 

�When we designed this extension we really sat down and thought about
the best way we could reach the most players. Whenever you add content
in terms of zones or items you are really focusing on a specific level
of character, which isn�t always the best investment of time. 

The Legacy of Ykesha extension had a lot more programming additions.
We felt that by offering people tools such as armor dyeing,
cartography, bank space, the NPC journal, etc, that everyone who plays
the game would get something immediate to improve their gameing
experience. I think we were pretty successful in achieving that goal. 

That said there is also some great content in the extension as well
for the mid to upper level characters with the new zones.� 

Watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat! 

Planes of Power introduced a lot of new code which up until the Legacy
of Ykesha had not been fully activated. The major event leading up to
the activation of the extension involved a fully scripted event with
no Human actors involved. 

The launch event involved a script 100 times larger than the Sleepers
Tomb event, involving over 10 zones and over 1500 scripted NPCs. It
was an experiemental event that was a complete success. The technology
developed worked and holds out for some exciting new additions to the
game in the future not only in terms of dynamic events but for more
large scale quest based activities similar to the fabled 10th Ring War
of Velious. 

One of the most amazing things about the new scripting system is how
complex it can be. NPC�s can now �zone� from one to the next to
complete their tasks, they can also be set to only proceed with
certain actions once multiple NPC�s have reached certain locations or
performed certain deeds (or even died!). 

It�s an exciting new element to the EverQuest world which players can
expect to see a lot more of in the near future. 

So will all new zones cost money now? 

Apparently the answer is no. The dev team currently has two new zone
revamps in the works: Plane of Hate and Veksar. 

The Plane of Hate is being rebuilt from the ground up to correct its
numerous pathing issues. The feel of the zone will remain similar to
how it is now but the zone will, for all intents, be a completely new
experience for players. 

Veksar is the underwater city in the Lake of Ill Omen and will be
aimed for Level 50 � 65 players. 

The team also mentioned that the Plane of Mischief revamp is
continuing. One revamp was completed but was rejected by Rich Waters
who felt that it could be improved even further before going live. 

No exact ETA on any of the new zones were given. 

The team stressed that players can expect to see a lot of zones
receiving some �love�. This won�t always mean total revamps but will
include improvements of many kinds: new NPC�s, Quests, Items,
improvements to pathing and spawns etc. Nurga was mentioned as one of
the zones that could do with some tweaks. 

And the game as it stands? 

There are many people who argue �Why make new stuff when there�s so
much existing content needing work?� We brought up some of the more
popular questions players ask: 

Is Caster Balancing ever going to be completed? 

Rich Waters spoke up for this: 

�I think there are some big discrepancies for certain classes,
especially in specialized situations such as raiding or soloing. I
don�t think that any class is so bad off that they�re not worth
playing, or are unable to contribute in a lot of ways. I think the
situation can be improved on, and in fact needs to be improved on.
While I don�t think that any single class is just plain broken, there
are dozens of little tweaks we�d like to make to each class. Lately,
my personal play time has been spent grouping mostly, and there isn�t
a single class I wouldn�t want to group with, or that I feel couldn�t
bring value to my group. 

We feel the classes are fairly balanced now. We certainly aren�t
saying everything is perfect, but we�re looking more long term and
trying to work towards more permanent solutions with the role of
classes and their abilities with the content we�re adding to the game.
There are a number of things we expect to tweak and tune still, but no
class is useless or unable to contribute in a variety of situations.� 

Archery & Line of Sight 

�That�s one I definitely wanted a solid answer for before the next fan
faire�, claimed Scott Hartsman. 

�Here�s the deal with Archery. Ranged combat is currently very
overpowered. Be it from a caster or an archer you could in some
circumstances deliver enormous amounts of damage with almost no hate
being added to you. This is being fixed very soon. 

We do have a fix for the line of sight bug ready for the Test Server
and the other little things archers want like auto-attack, but the
game is going to change a little once the hate-list system is
corrected and Rangers will need to be a lot more like Rogues in
watching their damage output to control aggro. Auto attack will
probably be situational at best once implemented if a Ranger wants to
stay alive.� 

That said the team is aware of the long term problems with archery and
hopes to implement its �Archery Patch� sometime in the next few
months. 

Will stats ever matter in EQ? 

The problem with reworking stats to have a more functional role in EQ
is that it would essentially cause either monsters to be significantly
more powerful than players or vice versa on a massive scale due to the
amount of old content in the game. 

While it may happen one day that the team has enough time to rebalance
every single NPC in every zone in the game to make such a sweeping
change happen it certainly isn�t in the foreseeable future right now. 

Stats have been made more effective where possible with tradeskills,
improvements to the health and mana formulas and other combat related
rolls, but there is a limit as to what can be done with them before
requiring a complete overhaul of the game. 

Does anyone care anymore about the PvP servers? 

�It�s important to realize that the PvP servers are not neglected,�
says Scott Hartsman. �We have a number of people on the team who play
on the PvP servers and when we code things we try our best to take
them into consideration. When we revamped the resist code to make it
more functional there were some issues that cropped up with PvP and we
were quick to implement appropriate code to retain the balance of
characters.� 

The more long term issues such as hard-coding teams and other PvP
issues are something which the team have to prioritize and right now
the focus appears to be on developing content which all players can
enjoy rather than only those on the PvP servers. 

The team behind the game 

One thing many players don�t realize is how committed the team is to
making EverQuest a fun and lasting game experience. Rich Waters
explains: �Right now the majority of our new team members added in the
last 18 months came from very strong play backgrounds. Some were
active members in very powerful raiding guilds in the game, others had
multiple characters of mid levels. We have a team who plays the game
right beside our other 400,000+ account holders and sees the same
things they do. Our meetings often start with �I was on a raid last
night and saw��. We love to play the game we make. We are always
listening in game, in emails and on boards to what our players are
saying and taking it into consideration with our design decisions.� 

EQ Going Strong! 

There is no denying the fact that EverQuest is still going very
strong. Recently they broke 118,000 simultaneous online users and
recently launched a new server in North America. 

The game has also spread through localization into Korea, China,
Taiwan and Japan and is beginning to pick up a completely new
following in the Asian market who currently play only the trilogy
version of EverQuest (Original, Kunark and Velious). 

The time spent with the team reflected their commitment to keeping the
world of EverQuest at the forefront of MMORPG gaming and players new
and old should expect some very exciting new things in the months to
come. 

The Tour 

After the time spent talking to the team we were also taken on a brief
tour of the new Ykesha zones with some buffed up Frogloks on Lizards. 

The zones look great! They can be accessed via Stonebrunt Mountains
(new ports were added to the Wizard and Druid classes to help
facilitate travel to the new areas). 

Most of the final fights are event triggered requiring players to
achieve certain tasks within the zone before the final monsters will
spawn. 

The tour was a lot of fun though and some of the new animations added
when NPC�s are killed are completely new to the world of EverQuest. 

Summary 

EverQuest is still the number one MMORPG today. It�s depth of content,
size of the world and game features provide players with something
that simply can�t be found in any other game online right now. 

The time spent with the team gave us a great insight into the
commitment required to not only make the game but continue to refine
and improve it as time goes on. 

With the new features we saw while at SOE headquarters players should
certainly be keeping a close eye on the world of Norrath as it works
toward another era of it�s life and matures into an even better game
than ever before.
