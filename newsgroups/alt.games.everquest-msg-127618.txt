Flaw:  no support for the idea that we were specifically created to do
anything, let alone sin.

Flaw:  no support for the idea that we were created to act in a way which
displeases God.

Flaw:  absurd unsupported statement.

Only for one who desires to have that much control.  Do you not find it
possible that God, knowing that people would make mistakes, still allows
them to determine the course of their lives?  You're argument assumes that
God specifically created each of use in a certain way.  Even if that were
so, it doesn't take into account things like environment.  Granted, God does
know these things, but the doesn't mean He designs certain people to
succeed, and some to fail.  There is no reason that God can't see the
future, and decide not to act on it.

The entire argument seems to come down to a question of "If He's so perfect,
why does He have creations that aren't?"  Maybe becasue He didn't set out to
make gods.
