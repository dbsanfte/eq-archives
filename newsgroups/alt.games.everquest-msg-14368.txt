Nothing personal, just responding to what you had to say.  Oh, and I am
not pissed off hehe.  If you thought that was a pissed off response god
help you if you ever did manage to make me angry about something.  This
is not only usenet, which is never good to take seriously, but a gaming
group.  Just can't see much use for anger here.  

FYI, just fired off a message to VI reminding them that as much as they
might like to appease the rabble by backing off on this, those of us who
depend on them to uphold the integrity of the game will be equally if
not more so angered if they let these folks off with less than just
punishment for their actions.  All to often the din of those who
disagree with them seems to make them change their minds, so why not a
bit of din from those who agree that weeding out those who should be
playing nintendo with cheat codes is actually a good thing rather than
an inhumane abridgment of unalienable rights to exploit?
