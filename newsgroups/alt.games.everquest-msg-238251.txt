Is it unattended macroing that's prohibited or is it detrimental unattended
macroing?

If it's the former, then yes, it's actionable, and I think that's what the
rules state, simply because a determination of whether specific macroing was
detrimental would just be more of a hassle than it's worth to SOE.

But SOE could approach it similar to how they've approached other issues,
meaning that yes, they don't particularly care that it's a violation of the
rules because no one's being hurt by them, with the exception of buff
sellers, and I don't think SOE will go out of their way to help them out.
