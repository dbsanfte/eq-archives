Not remotely. See below.

James Bond, Rambo, Conan, Indianna Jones, Aliens, Dark City, Willow, 
Robin Hood, Sleeping Beauty, The Hobbit, Resident Evil, Terminator, 
Neverending Story, Dungeons and Dragons, Gladiator, Chronicles of 
Riddick, Pitch Black, The Rundown, Spiderman,...

Every single one of them, and countless thousands were about the 
miraculous victories of /individuals/ and  /small groups/ overcoming 
incredible odds.

Even LotR had Sam and Frodo single handedly carry the one ring to Mount 
Doom, under the nose of Sauron, past uncountable orcs, his undead 
servants, Shelob, and more...  

In fact even your story about Isildur is a personal accomplishment. Sure 
he had a horde of elves and men behind him, but they didn't inflict a 
single point of damage on Sauron. When was the last time that happened 
on a raid?

And if you happen to read the Silmarillion, the silmarils were at one 
point recovered from Sauron, in his fortess, by an individual.

I can think of vanishingly few examples where 'a raid sized force' are 
ever celebrated in literature or film for their joint accomplishment.

Bob, Ferryman doesn't want to kill 10,000 boring goblins. He needs to 
sneak into Saurons tower, cut the one ring from his hand, and dive out a 
window and escape while dodging and killing the agitaged minions 
searching for him. If the instanced zone where this takes place is a 4 
hour event, and the quest for the map, keys, poison to temporaily blind 
Sauron, and various trinkets to get past specific obstacles takes 2+ 
months to complete... PERFECT.

Only someone truly unimaginative would view the situation as one that 
requires you to simply load up on badass buddies to bash the front door 
down, kill everything up to the throne room, and then then kill Sauron 
by pushing him into a corner while your biggest baddest tank insults 
Sauron's mother to try and keep his 'aggro' attention on him, while the 
rest of the team cuts him to shreds. And if it doesn't work, try again 
the following night, hopefully with just a little more 'badass' crew.

Hell that's what is wrong with EQ.
