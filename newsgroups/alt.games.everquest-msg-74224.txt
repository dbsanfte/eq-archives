But do you see a problem with this even when its working? Yep, thats
right.. 2000 players PLAYING on a server at any one time. Since you
can do this when you are AFK (set yourself up as a vendor) and
sleeping (in fact verant already said this was their intention)
exactly how many people do you think might be doing this on a server.
Have you looked at the size of the bazaar zone?

Hint: if 50 people did this it would be crowded there and they'd
probably all not fit well. But how many more than 50 even would be
doing it at say 3 am eastern when they are asleep? I'd guess at least
200 or more on your average server, if they can. If they can't and its
first come first serve instead, guess what will happen? Yep, once
again people with a second account and second computer who can "hog"
the bazaar vendor space with the other account while playing with
their current one will have a HUGE advantage.  

It seems to me that they'd need at least 5 or more bazaar zones per
server. Hmm this sounds familar and I think I posted a very similar
reply before to a very similar post, if so forgive me for repeating
myself 9 times ;)
