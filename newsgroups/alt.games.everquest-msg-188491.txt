My top three choices would be:

1. Ultima Online- very fun and it has a feel to it that no other game I have
played has.

2. Asheron's Call 2- again very fun, higher levels are awesome, just not so
many players so it feels empty.

3. Everquest- for me it really lost its fun after I hit level 50, Now 65
with many AA skills and in a high end guild, but the early stages of it was
very very fun.  A good way to describe EQ is its a giant chat room where you
fight monsters while you talk, that's probably the key to its success
because its like a game version of AOL haha.

Those are the three games that I recommend out of the bunch because they
have something that the rest don't.
