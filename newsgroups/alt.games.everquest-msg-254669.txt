I'm surprised not to have seen any discussion of this yet: what is
the formula for determining full mana?  Previously, I'd been using
a formula I found on some caster web site (probably Caster's Realm),
which was (where STAT is INT or WIS as appropriate):

	[ (STAT / 5) + 2 ] x LEVEL

or, equivalently,

	(STAT + 10) x LEVEL / 5

at least for STAT of 200 or below.  I'd wondered if it were
correct, since sometimes a spell seemed to consume the wrong
percentage of total mana (on those rare occasions when I could take
the time to check).  Well, now that the numbers are visible, it's
clear the formula is off.  For my two casters, it's off by 10-20
mana.  No big deal, but since people have worked out formulas for
HP that seem to work pretty well, I figure it's time to do it for
mana, and I was wondering where that discussion is happening.

I generated a bunch of numbers to play with using my two casters,
but though I could vary WIS/INT a lot I still had only two levels
to play with.  Plus it's conceivable that there are different
formulas (or different constants plugged into a common formula)
for different classes, as there are for HP.  Still, the following
seems to be either equal to or just 1 over my observed values for
a wizard 17 and druid 26:

	(STAT + 20) x LEVEL x 3 / 16

As you can see, the multiplier of 3/16 makes things slightly
smaller than the previously assumed multiplier of 1/5, but adding
20 instead of 10 to the STAT compensates for that at low levels,
so it's only at mid-to-high levels that the different really shows
up.

I also think there must be more than one place where numbers get
rounded to integers, because adding 1 WIS at a time would sometimes
alternate between adding 4 and 6 mana.  If there were just one
roundoff on the whole calculation, I think each point of STAT
would have to add the same amount of mana, which with rounding
could vary by 1 but never by 2.
