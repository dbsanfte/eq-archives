    Good lord, congrats!

    They don't.

    If the Sleeper is awake on your server, then gnome masks won't be for
trade. But other than that, you have an item that will trade for a TON of
cash. As an estimate, I'd say between one and two times the price of a Cloak
of Flames on your server (on mine that would be around 100 K). The only
people that won't want one will be folks who kill Tormax and have White
Dragonscale Boots.
