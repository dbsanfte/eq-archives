HELP!

I was on my way from Butcher to FV.  Due to a graphics glitch (boat floors
seem to be invisible to me) I fell off the ramp from shuttle to boat in TD.
I have managed to find a reasonably unpopulated island at loc 5345, -4480.
but have NO CLUE how to get back to civilisation.

From the map on EQAtlas, it seems my best hope would be to try swimming
directly south to the island with an elven outpost.  Would those elves be
KOS to me?  I am a woody ranger with typical "good" factions.  Is the swim
possible at my level?  Im 20th, and my swimming is 29.  What will happen to
me if my stamina runs out? I noticed even in the fairly short trip from
shuttles to island I lost 4 out of 5 bubbles of sta.

My only other thought is to beg a guide or gm since it was a graphics glitch
they might take pity on me and save my a__.

Does anybody have any thoughts?  I am hoping to get back with my inventory
intact.  "Ranger gate" wont cut it.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Martyn,
Ranger just into my 20th season on Povar.
