Incorrect.  The motherboard-based overheating detection is for cases
where the fan fails.  The test where they caught fire was when the
heatsink itself was removed.  In that case, the motherboard-based
detection can't do anything, because the CPU heats up far faster than
the response rate of the sensor.  The sensor can't handle more than
around 1C/second change, but the CPU went from normal to on fire in
around 3 seconds.

However, this should not be a problem with current AMDs.  The current
revision has a system similar to the P4, I believe, and so won't burst
into flames if the heatsink falls off.
