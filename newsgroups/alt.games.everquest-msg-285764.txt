It really depends on your intent. Your primary interest levels in the 
various classes, as well as those of your friend, also play a significant 
part.

First and foremost, I would recommend you each play the class you find 
most interesting/fun. There are ways to make most combinations work well 
enough. Beyond that, you might consider concerning yourselves with 
covering a couple of basic needs to decrease downtime/survivability - 
healing and/or tanking, for example. You can either include a healing 
class, or select classes that might serve to minimize the need for a 
healer. 

Personally, I've always thought it would be a blast to duo with someone 
where one of us played a mage and one of us a necromancer. Both classes 
can heal their pet to some extent, and both classes can really dish out 
some nice damage. Plus with two pets and a necromancer, crowd control can 
be managed pretty well. Some people claim that duoing *any* class with a 
necro just slows the necro down, but, whether that's true or not, if 
you're not too concerned with micro-managing your xp/sec, I really can't 
see where that would be an issue.

If you are primarily concerned with best covering as many bases as 
possible with regard to useful/necessary skills and abilities between the 
two characters, Shadowknight/Shaman pretty much have that distinction.

Clerics are nice to have, as they have the best heals, AC/HP buffs and 
rezzes in the game. Though some find the cleric class a bit too one-
dimensional, it doesn't have to be that way. It's really all in how you 
play them. Clerics also pair up well with many classes - plate tanks, 
monks, rangers, mages, berserkers, heck, just about any class other than 
wizard and rogue (and maybe enchanter), really.

I could go on, but I really think the best option is the one I started 
with here - pick the classes the two of you find the most interesting and 
fun to play - within reason, I suppose. There are perhaps a few 
combinations that might prove frustrating enough to be discouraging, such 
as rogue/enchanter, perhaps.

Lastly, would you be interested in a third? Depending on how much time 
you are planning on putting into it, I might know someone who would be 
interested in joining a regular group. ;) Shoot me an email.
