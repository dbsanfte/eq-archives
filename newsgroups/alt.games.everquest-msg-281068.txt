That's a nice service.  I'm tempted to use it, even here in the U.S.  I've
finally found a place to pick it up after calling every software seller in
town so I'll be getting it after work today.  The big shocker is that
WalMart told me that not only do none of the local stores have it, but *no*
WalMart has it or ever got it.  Whether this is WalMart's "fault" or Sony's
is hard to guess, but not getting your product onto the shelves of the
biggest retailer in the world is not the making of good business.

There's also the distinct possibility that the person I talked to at WalMart
was clueless.  They are the biggest because of their prices and convenience,
not because of the qualifications of their salespeople.  =)
