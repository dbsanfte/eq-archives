50+ there are two sets of rules for equipping yourself.

As a TANK:

1. If you are still mostly trying for experience, you want AC, then
hp, then stats (sta first, str second, agi third, dex fourth), then
resists. The point of the tank in getting experience as efficiently as
possible is to limit the amount of mana the healers of the party
(generally the chokepoint of a party is the healer's mana). AC does
this best, by a slight edge over raw hp.

2. For raids, you want HP (including sta boosters), then resists, then
AC, then stats. Derakor isn't going to give a crap what your AC is,
nor Cazic 3.0, or other high end meleeing ubermobs - they'll still max
you way too often anyways. Survivability is the key. You have to be
able to take a full round of quads from these guys and hp is the way
to do it. Obviously resists only matter if the mob is aeing, but if it
is, have the proper one (or two) at least 100 unbuffed.

As a SUPPORT CLASS:

1. For experience, you should try to get 200 in your main casting
attribute, because no one likes it when you go oom at the critical
point of a hard fight. This is easy for some (druids and most pure
casters) and hard for others (clerics, enchanters who need both int
and cha).

Clerics should not neglect their armor class. Enchanters should
concentrate more on hp, not ac. HP is a lot easier to come by.

For the other classes, skill in aggro management is the important
thing, so necros, wizards, magicians, and druids should all worry
mostly about mana, not about getting hit. If they are getting hit,
they screwed up. If you are talking to one of those classes and they
seem obsessed about armor class, you are talking to a caster who
snares too early, overnukes, etc and should be watched closely....

2. For raids... its all about resists and hp. Sacrifice mana, stats,
anything as long as you have the proper resists and as many hp as you
can get. If you over aggro some of those monsters will put you down in
one round of melee (especially pure casters). The more hp you have,
the better chance of surviving one round (if it goes much past that
nothing will help other than a divine light or two :-) ).

All IMO :-)
