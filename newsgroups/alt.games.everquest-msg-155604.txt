I agree, but with a pickup group it's impossible to know what you're
stepping into beforehand.  In groups where pulling is the tactic, I
have never been in a group that didn't overpull, even when the melees
were way down on health.  I have told the group, "<puller> needs to
rest and heal before next pull" for all the good it ever did.  In
part, I think the situation arises from the fact that there are a lot
more campers than camps.  Generally you can't form a good group in a
neutral location (say the Nexus) then port into the Dreadlands without
finding all the good locs taken.  When a toon sees an open camp spot,
he/she has to jump on it and the pull a group together.

I had a great group in High Keep Basement, too.  We had a good group
with a cleric that knew what she was doing.  Made a level plus some
very quickly.  In a series of mediocre to horrible group experiences,
that was one of two goodies.  The xp bonus there must be very good.
