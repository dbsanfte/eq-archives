In practice many people respect campers in the game (and then bitch about it
all over the place).  In the rules it really is not allowed first hit gets
it.
       If a group calls  GM type to claim someone is trying to take
something they have camped it is the campers who will here everyone has
equal shot or take turns or the like.  I almost always respect the camper
and move on (sometimes cursing under my breath) unless they piss me off with
rudeness. In that case I call the GM who explains to them that take turns is
the rule.  At that point they usually get so pisssed off having to take
turns on what they had been hogging they leave and I or my group get the
whole thing.

Bunboy,
    The people who can smile when things go wrong have found someone else to
blame.
