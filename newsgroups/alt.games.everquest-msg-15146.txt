I find it amusing, DT, that you'd say CIA, NSA, USAD, and DoD are not 
"words", when the definition you're using to support the assertion that 
they are therefore not acronyms suggests, by example, that NATO _is_ a 
word.

From the same dictionary:

Main Entry: 1word
Pronunciation: 'w&rd
Function: noun
Etymology: Middle English, from Old English; akin to
Old High German wort word, Latin verbum, Greek
eirein to say, speak, Hittite weriya- to call, name
Date: before 12th century
2b(2): any segment of written or printed discourse ordinarily appearing 
between spaces or between a space and a punctuation mark
