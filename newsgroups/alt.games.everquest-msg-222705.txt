Not sure what makes you think you have the right to decide what someone
should sell something for.  Sure it may a valid haggling tactic, but its not
doing you any good coming here to tell on him.  If you didnt think it was
worth that much you shouldnt have paid that much.  And the reason he didnt
go any lower was not Xev's economy, it was because he didnt have to go lower
to find a buyer.  You just validated his price.
