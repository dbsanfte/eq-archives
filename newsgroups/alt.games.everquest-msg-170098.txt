"Experience is the most powerful form of twinking".

My first two characters to make it past the teens were my monk and my
wizard. I remember when my wizard got "bind". It was a glorious day. I'd
been playing for well over a month by then, and playing pretty often. I
just had no clue what I was doing.

Speaking of untwinked, I started a naked gnome rogue on Test on a Friday
recently. Played him a couple hours, including some time hunting greens
scrounging up drops for newbie armor. He was 12 on Saturday afternoon.

My oh my, but it's different after you've already done it.
