Assuming you are Qeynos based the best place I've found at your level
is the north shore of Antonica. Just go to the Oracle Tower and run
along the coast in an eastern direction harvesting everything you see.
Once you reach the mountains simply run back westerly harvesting all
the respawns. Repeat until you get bored or run out of inventory space.

Few people go there so it generally empty and full of nodes. Only
problem I see is that at your level the mobs might be frightening as
this is also the highest level area of Antonica.
