My wife is using my old PII - 400 on an old BX chipset motherboard in her
system for EQ.  I want to upgrade slowly (for Luclin) and figured Id get her
some RAM and a new video card first.  Two questions:

1) Her upgrade, when I am done, will most likey have a PC-133 supported
motherboard.  I assume that PC-133 RAM will work in a PC-100 motherboard.
Is that a correct assumption?

2) Her motherboard has an AGP slot (not sure if it is 1x or 2x...probably
1x).  If I buy her an AGP 2x/4x video card, will it work in her current AGP
slot?

Thanks!
