YUP.  Faction overrides everything.  You might be, as a halfling,
apprehensive but you can work it up.
There are several types of 'base' factions - race, class, and religion.
You'll see sometimes a merchant says (to me, anyway) "I thought rogues like
you had your own merchants" even if they're indiff to me otherwise.  In
Erudin, I'll be attacked if I show up as a DE there but I can work that
faction up like I did in NFP.
Those are the effects of base factions which you'll start with any other
faction based on your startup choices.  You can work on almost (some
factions have never found ways to raise, just lower) every faction in the
game to get yourself somewhere.

Guides/GMs won't get involved in a quest that you're unable to do for
faction reasons. They'll just tell you to go work your faction up and try
again.

Best advice I can offer is when you read about a great quest on a spoiler
site, actually GO to the NPCs and see if you've got the faction for it.
When I was low-20s, I heard about the Silversilk (mesh?) Leggings quest for
rogues and camped the NPC (my first and only looong camp).  I got the gem
from the NPC and boogied off to GFay to collect my leggings.   Well, I
checked the npc first before handing in the gem (thank goodness) and found
that I had to go all the way back to the first of the quests with rusty
daggers and then pixie dusts.  I spent a few more hours getting my Scout
faction up but have a wonderful pair of Silversilk Leggings in the bank now.
P.S. Any Elf-type rogues on DR should give me a tell if they want them.
