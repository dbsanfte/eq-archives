That's funny. I didn't care much for the main novella "Low Men In Yellow 
Coats", but the title story "Hearts In Atlantis" was absolutely priceless 
for me, not only because it's so good, but because the plight of the 
students that *must* get pass their exams or be sent to Vietnam, but 
can't stop playing Hearts, mirrored almost exactly what I was going 
through at the time... I had to get my demo reel finished and get a job 
before my US visa expired, or get kicked out of the country, but I 
couldn't stop playing EverQuest. =)

The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.
