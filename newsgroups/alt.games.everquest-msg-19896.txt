I soloed Shakrn solo at level 41 as a paladin. Made it to 42 in about
eight hours. It's probably still doable and even quicker with his new
brother as long as you can break the initial spawn. Should be easy if
LoH is up. I suspect that only hybrids or strong pet classes can do this
solo as quickly because the spawn time is 6 minutes. Other classes would
take too long to heal or regain mana.
