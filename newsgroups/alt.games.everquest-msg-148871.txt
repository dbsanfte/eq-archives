No offense but it is not the way of the future. If more people do this
they'll eventually figure out it's a bad idea when they go bankrupt.
AOLers alone can't keep a game alive. I play the games to build up
myself and gather equipment and accomplish quests and such on my own.
If they just hand out the damn characters at any level what's the
point of playing at all? There is no point, everyone regardless of how
much damn money they have should be able to play on equally with
everyone else on the server they are on. (ie EQ legends) If they want
to make a separate server in which people who buy characters can have
their little fun on then fine with me but when you can just buy a
fully leveled and trained character and interact with people who have
worked months to get their's up to the same level then that is so damn
unfair it makes me want to puke. People who like the idea of buying
characters would argue that would defeat the point of buying a
character which is where their argument breaks down, they want an
unfair advantage over other people just because they don't want to do
the work themselves therefore the idea is useless and will eventually
destroy any game's player base and therefore the game.
