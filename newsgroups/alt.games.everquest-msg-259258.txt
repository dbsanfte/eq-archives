but i'm on my mount constantly, so i'd only go the speed of the mount
anyways even if i did have run3, except of course indoors, but that's mostly
only on ldons, in which case there is no real reason to move fast at all,
unless you're running from something, in which case i could just FD and
laugh while i watch the rest of my group run for the lives.

i've heard that they're easier to get at 65, but i still don't think i want
to wait that long.  besides, i like to take things slow, so getting as many
levels and aa's in the least amount of time really isn't my goal.
