I've been in groups where we've shouted for people to come loot
threads. Thread farming can be combined with getting exp; bile farming
is a tedious no-exp thing. Also, even without the exp factor, I could
probably get 75 threads faster than I could get 5 biles (2 to go!)

I'm going to talk nicely with a guild enchanter about that, and
meanwhile, I collect what little silk drops in Velk's (hate CC).
Also considering doing a few studded cultural boots for skillups.

I'm at 113 now, have a few crystalline silks, and have half a dozen HQ
cat pelts on an alt. I might get tailoring to 120 or so before trying,
but it really hinges on when I get my last two biles.

>I plan on getting it to 158 before I make the attempt on the 6th shawl.

Ditto.
