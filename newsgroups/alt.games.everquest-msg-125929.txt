Aye, Ragefire has become unbelievably painful.  I've spent probably 40
hours in the past 2 weeks helping a guild cleric camp Rage.  In the
time I've had a pissing match with a guild I've never had a single
issue with (though their guildleader is still pissed about something a
year ago that involved one of my guildie SKs failing on his epic
turn-in), been told by a GM that we could either random for the camp
or deal with the KS battle, and had spent probably 500 lines of chat
just explaining that we're not there to KS anyone, but will kill fast
if we get first aggro.
The only good part about the whole camp was actually getting along
with the server grief guild, though I think it has more to do with the
fact that I have a pretty good working relationship with their leader.
Of course after 12 hours of brinkmanship, both guilds dropped below
critical mass in zone, Rage spawned, and another guild ported in,
buffed, and dropped him in less than 7 minutes.
