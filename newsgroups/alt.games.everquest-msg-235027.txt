My current lineup with my bard (43rd) when duoing with a pali friend
is:

Gems:
1) heal/mana
2) slow/snare
3) dot
4) dot
5) dot
6) mez
7) lull
8) charm - alternate regen

Hotkeys:
1)heal/mana (gem1)
2)slow/snare (gem2)
3)dot  (gem3)
4)dot (gem4)
5)dot (gem5)
6)mez (gem6)
7) inventory bag [pouch i keep weapons and instruments in]
8) weapon slot
9) heal/mana
10) gem slot 8 (during down time I drop a second regen which stacks
with heal mana) and twist 9,10

During single pull fight I'll twist 1-5 juggling a lute/drum. or just
2-5 when I don't want to juggle and we can live without the extra
regen.

During a double pull I'll twist 2-4 and 6 on the add or if mana is
full I'll charm and then its a single pull.

During a bigger fight i switch to flute and go cc (charm+mez) and slow
the hopefully single target the pali has left on if i've got time.

7 and 8 let me switch instruments easier. (the bag opens right next to
the hot key bank to allow minimal dragging) As well as give me a
constant visual cue which instrument  I'm using.

I'd be particularly interested in the "Does amplification affect
haste/slow" amounts?? Since that would affect my lineup.

Our tactics are typically I pull and the pali engages while i keep it
dotted and slowed. Or when the pali can't toe a melee we root rot it.
He roots, I rots. Or if its a caster and we can't toe-toe it we fear
kite. fear+slow while he beats it. If theres no room to kite and we
can't toe-toe it we will do it in stages... fight+mez/heal+repeat.
Sometimes during the fight I'll chain mez to let the pali back off at
will, and because it interrupts spells, and reduces mob melee a bit
too.

At 43rd at least, I've found the Resistance songs to be a waste of
space. Everything still lands 90% percent of time. I'd be curious what
others think.
