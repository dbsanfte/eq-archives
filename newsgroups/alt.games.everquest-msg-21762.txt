Ok...i play eq alot, and my fiance' wants to start playing it as well...

We have cable modem, and a 4 port router, and 4 machines connected to it,
all able to play EQ, but only 2 of them are mainly used for gaming.

My questions is: Is there a way to only buy one copy of EQ and play on
multiple machines using the same login/pw to log on, and then just play with
seperate char...?  Im asking this because i have seen people say that them
and thier wife play ....

If there isnt a way, its no problem to go buy a seperate copy...i was just
wondering if its Legal and/or able to be accomplished.

Thank you for any help on this matter.....

Derek
