I just made a cleric of ridecet nife in qeynos on the Tallon Zek
server. Since this is my first PVP experience I could appreciate any
pointers. I assume that I got a hard road ahead cause evils just love
to kill a goody-two-shoes nice girl cleric who loves to heal things
and goes around blabbing about rodecet nife. And I didnt understand
the team concept until someone told me that I can group with human
races only and to watch out for shorties, elves and dark ones. They
cant loot items can they? Im sure PVP is a whole differnt ball game
from blue servers but the anxiety of worrying about getting ganged up
on by a bunch of arsewipes makes being a low level cleric that much
better. Hehehe.....remember...Rodecet Nife is the only true way.
