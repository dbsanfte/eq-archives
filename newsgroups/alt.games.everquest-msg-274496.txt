Their desire to remain in a guild that isn't being run to their liking? 

That's rather like desiring to wear a shirt that doesn't fit. You might 
like the idea of wearing the shirt, but actually wearing it? Forget it.

Consensus doesn't imply universal agreement. If the loot regularly were 
arbitrarily given to someone the majority of the guild disagreed with 
it, (not just the alternative recipient and their best freinds) things 
would have to change.

So we agree. :) The leader always exists at the sufference of the 
participants and the 'empowerment' of the leader is proportional to the 
cost of breaking away.

The cost of breaking away from a guild is invariably quite low. So 
'relative' power of the leaders is proportionally quite low.

Decisions characteristic of 1) & 2) can really only exist when there is 
considerable empowerment, because you can rely on the 'cost of breaking 
away' to discourage dissent.
