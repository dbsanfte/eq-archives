Judging from your name, I can see why you would say that.

If I had a name that was that fucking idiotic, I'd pray for a GM to come
take it away too....

Didn't bother looking at the thread, dunno if I would believe it happened,
but your name, and the reputation that goes along with it, is one of the few
irreplacable parts of your character.
