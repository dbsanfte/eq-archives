By definition.  

If you don't understand the phrases "by definition" and "as
given" as tools in logic, you might want to go look them up on
the web somewhere.

In order to eliminate any percieved differences in our play
styles, my hypothetical group is precisely emulating YOUR play
style, with only the single exception of where we started.

This way, we can discuss the difference in where to start.

But no, we got away from "locked at 80M" a long time ago in this
discussion, it was useful when I thought you were locked at 30M. 
Since you aren't, and the 50M difference is what I was trying to
get at, I matched your pull rate.

This means that my group never waits when your group doesn't
wait. 

The FM thing is more of a problem, of course, I've repeatedly
admitted that FM is a waste of resources, which is why I picked
80M as a general target in the first place.  If the group isn't
capable of pulling faster than the cleric can regen 20M they are
probably not working up a sweat, or the group is overpowered for
the mission.

Because you miss the point.  Group B has 50M more than you, even
pulling exactly precisely as you do.

Because you STARTED at 30M, while group B started at 80M

I do agree that 100M is wasting resources, which is why I said
80M, not FM; avoiding FM is important for maximum efficiency. 
But with that single caveat and the other one, which is that at
the very low end of the scale you end up forced to use fast heals
just because you dont' have the mana to do a real heal, any level
of mana is Exactly as efficient as any other level; you spend
some you regen some and you keep going, only your mana regen rate
matters in the long run.

Group B is in danger of running to FM, group A is in danger of
running to OOM.  FM results in wasted mana regen, OOM results in
death.  FM can be countered by pulling faster, OOM can be
countered by pulling slower.  Are you Sure a LOM group is
faster?  Seems to me the opposite might be true.  But in this
case we are discussing, its not, because both groups pull at the
same rate.

If you don't need one, I don't need one.  All I'm saying is, IF
you ever do, and group B doesn't, then there goes your single
advantage, which is some time saved before entering the dungeon;
now you lose that time, and you lose it when its Important, that
is on the timer, instead of outside where it doesn't count on the
clock.

You seem to be missing the argument.  When you stopped waiting
for 30M, (which admittedly you never said you did, I just
inferred it from what you were saying) I stopped waiting for 80M;
instead I precisely matched your pull rate in every regard.

If there's only a few minutes left, NOW its time to spend that
mana reserve.  And the group that Entered at 30M doesnt' have one
to spend, but the group that entered at 80M does have it.  So
they are able to go not only at the same pace as the 30M group,
they are able to go faster for a brief spurt.

> out.  :P
> 
No, its not.  Time is always running.  But its only running OUT
near the end of the time span.  This is what the phrase is for;
your definition would make it a meaningless noise.  You mean
"clock's ticking", which is a good case for running the fastest
pull rate you can manage without falling behind on mana.  "Time
is running out" means you can now pull faster than mana regen in
a last ditch all out anerobic effort to cross the finish line
before the gun goes off.

Look at it as a mile long race.  Group B runs at their best
steady pace for most of the mile, then sprints at the last 100
yards, crossing the line in near collapse but in their best
possible time.  The other group sprints in the beginning, then
half walks, half runs the rest of the way, ending up much slower
because they were out of breath most of the mile.

Group A runs their 100 yard sprint BEFORE the race, so they don't
even have the slight initial advantage "the other group" had.  If
they need to sprint at the end of the race because they are a
little behind, they simply can't do it.

I'm not clear how reading this thread would make anyone pull at
any rate other than your rate, since its been stated explicitly
over and over that the PULL RATE IS THE SAME.

ONLY the mana going into the dungeon varies.

What he could do if he wanted to test this thread out would be to
deliberately waste mana chain healing a FHP tank for no reason,
so as to get his mana down to the 30M mark.

If he really wanted some fun, he could convince everyone to tell
you they had exactly 50M less than they really did at all times,
then when anyone went OOM he could say "and we all die"

Hmm, wait, I think I get you.  Paladin wasn't pulling slower than
you do, he was pulling faster.  So the 30M the group was starting
with wasn't adequate.  While this is a "proof of concept", in
that your group wasn't able to handle the overpull, its not a
good one; the idea isn't that the group can't handle constant
overpull; no group can, thus the "over" part; its that the group
can't handle any unexpected negative turn like a large accidental
overpull; its not ready for large spikes in mana use.  

So you'll have to send him back to pulling school if thats the
problem.
