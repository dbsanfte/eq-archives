recent? well, dating back to the "big one" about a year or two ago......

monks lost some tanking abilitiy, but it was balanced by AAxp, so yes, monks
are still better tanks than rangers, and can solo blues in some areas

dps though does suffer, and i don't really know why, but plenty of my monk
friends agree we did lose some dps -- that, or other classes got better,
relatively speaking


monks are excellent; my monk is 55 and i can tank white mobs (not in PoP)
just fine as i wait for slow to land

i was doing it last night

i'm kind of poor despite the years i spent in this game, so my damage is
slightly on par with rogues and rangers that are a few levels lower than me,
and just under a pally and war with high end gear (gsofw, boc/sbod) i know
that are under 59....i imagine i'd be under a sk with a high end piece also,
but i regularly fight with the pally and war and parse often

i guess monks should get the epic as soon as they can and use it until
around 58/59 (or 61/62 depending on who you know) when the chances will
arise to loot a super-duper 2hb, which is what i want to do

in all my parsing, i found that delay truly is the most important stat for
dps, and bare-fisted epic monks have roughly 15-25 dps MORE than monks with
things like WLK or entwood or whatever

and hell, when played right, monks don't die, i guarantee (this guarantee
void in the case of monks pulling 63+ mobs)

the meaning behind the fact that with full buffs and appropriate gear *all*
melee can contend with one another = damage is not to be worried about!

sorry for the long response...what i should have said:

>are they any good compared to other tank
>classes any more?

they're decent

>Or even any good?

yes, of course

>I mean do theuy dish out the damage and
>mitigate it like they used to?

not really, but they're still in scale with the rest of the classes, and
still a lot of fun to play
