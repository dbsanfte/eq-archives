    That's flat-out extortion. Not typical, and I'd avoid the cleric in
future dealings.

    However, clerics are forced into paying more than most in day-to-day
expenses because of Symbol. It isn't so bad at lower levels, but once a
cleric starts casting Temperance or Symbol of Naltron, they have significant
expenses. Most clerics are very wary of getting hosed on the split, because
depending on how the adventure went they could end up in the hole for the
day.
