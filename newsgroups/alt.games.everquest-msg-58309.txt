Get some good armor class (cheap stuf) and just snare, damage shield and
dot. Dont wory about taking damage, use treeform for medding up and the
healing is virtually free. Dont fight in treform or the monster will knock
you "through the world" (thanks verant). If youre defense is close to max it
wont be too painful for a 29 druid with the right equipment.
