To Mulitiquest both players must be Grouped and have appropriate faction
then take turns turning in the Items the last person to turn in his item
gets the reward. This can be done with as much as 4 people. Example player 1
turns in the Ring of the Ancients, Player 2 turns in the Shadow Rapier,
Player 3 turns in the 3250gp player 3 gets JBoots.
