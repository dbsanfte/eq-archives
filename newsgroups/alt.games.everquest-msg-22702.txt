Work?
Just because we find end game raids to be fun instead of sitting in
PoG farming for armor drops, you think we treat the game as work?

I think our definition of raids differ.
Now that Shissar lasts 30 mins and appears to properly stack, you need
one enchanter with a snake stick at most raids.

Do me a favor, explain to me how a plane "raid" is a raid.  We're
talking about Fear/Hate mobs which are levels 49 to 52, have 15khps
and double for 130 to 140.  In comparison, a reet frog is about level
53, has about 15khps, and hits for 140ish.

Even second floor Hate mobs are roughly level 55 to 57, comparable to
Juggs in Sebilis.  Juggs in Seb are now raid mobs?

Hell the god damn shrooms in Seb are more annoying than most Fear/Hate
mobs.  At least shrooms have some half ass magic resistence to make
them a challenge.

How are you gonna get Turgur to stick on Cazic Thule?  Tash, Malo,
Occulsion and it will STILL bounce.

You mean after they've raised the level cap to 60, some player was
able to tank a level 50ish mob in a zone filled with level 50ish mobs.
Amazing feat of accomplishment.

What does this have to do with raids?

Rogues outdamage every class by a HUGE factor.

Monks can generate very significant amount of damage, more so than
warriors.

Rangers using Trueshot can generate SICK amounts of damage from
OUTSIDE melee range of the mob.

SKs can actually do decent damage with their disc and procs.

Even paladins have a critical role in managing aggro at the initial
pulls.
