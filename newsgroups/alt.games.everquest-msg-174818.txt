Hopefully our plan looks more like what we did in Japan and Germany (minus
the entire splitting down the middle thing) then our usual "bomb 'em and

It's basically going to take a cultural and govenrmental "reboot" to
straighten things out, like what we did in Japan.

With at least four carriers in the area, I'd say I have a 50/50 chance of
