I'm surprised by how high level they are. I thought they only got points 
if they were in a fairly narrow level range, so there wasn't any point 
to getting high level because it would put you out of kill range for the 
vast (and perpetually recycling lowbies).

As for as being 50+... untwinked, with no highlevs to assist with PL, 
its non trivial to get up to 50+, especially since you aren't allowed a 
single mistake. I'm sure people could do it, but since that's not whats 
being scored on, and the server will be reset theres not much point.
