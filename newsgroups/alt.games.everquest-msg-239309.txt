Actually, the two situations can't be compared at all. There are no
competing power companies in addition to the fact that the power
services are vastly more important. In the case of a luxury service,
it's preferable to put out 5000 people more frequently and risk losing
them than it is to schedule putting out 500,000 people less frequently
and risk losing more than 5000. In fact, the percentage of players who
ONLY play at the normal patch times and thus are always completely out
for the day when they patch is so small, it's an affordable loss.

And I lived on the East coast for most of my EQ "career", so, yeah, I
was impacted by the patch days and found myself out play most of the
day when they patched (since I worked late shifts and really didn't
have much time to play after work). The patches would often run right
up until I had to start getting ready for work, or close enough that
it wasn't really worth logging in. Guess what? I fucking dealt with
it. It's a game, it's not my power service.
