My brother keep trying to tell me why EQ is better than Diablo. He doesn't listen to me when I try 
to explain that you can't compare the two because they aren't even the same type of game. I tell
him that Diablo is more like Quake than it's like EQ. You can logon to Diablo and hack up some
skeletons or whatever and logoff. With EQ you logon and put hours of effort into accomplishing
a goal: there is no quick game of EQ. Also, EQ is a much more social game, when you group in
EQ in most cases you are in constant communication with your group - if for no other reason than
to let each other know what's happening. I've only had one group in Diablo that had any sort of
conversation, and that was only to let each other know when we had to go back to town.

So, if you have half an hour to play, start up Diablo; if you have the evening, it's time for EQ.
