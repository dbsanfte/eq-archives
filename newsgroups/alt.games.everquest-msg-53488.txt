So tell me what you would have done if someone constantly keeps KSing you
and won't stop after you've asked him to?  Do all six of you move off to
somewhere else?  Keep whining like little kids?

I admit that I allowed him to draw me down to his level.  That's what pissed
me off.

Yep.  Its supposed to be a game, not something where one little punk can
ruin it for 8 other people.  No the punk didn't.

This the Firiona Vie -- the roleplaying server?  Its like having a wizard
called Nooker

Well, after the petition, I went on and had a fabulous time in Oasis with a
few different groups.  I think you're attributing too much to one little
petty (hey, I'm petty, I revel in being petty) act.

>Calm down, then get back to the game.

Calm, always calm.  Back to the game and am steadily working my way to lvl
20.

BTW say a lvl 45 druid today.  Got a robe of the oracles for his second
account, sheesh!
