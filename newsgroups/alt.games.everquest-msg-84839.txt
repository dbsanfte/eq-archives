I assume, then, that you do not know that the 1 key (keyboard 1, not numpad 
1) performs Hotkey #1 on the current bank? 

But you are right, I had missed the "while typing out lines" part. I am a 
pretty fast typist, so this is rarely an issue for me.

This is nonfunctional for me, as I program most of my hotkeys with socials 
and the /doability, /cast, /g, etc features. Spellcasting I usually 
accomplish with Alt-#.
