Gentlemanly rules are a fairly subjective thing.

I would generally expect a farmer to yield a green loot camp if an exp
group wanted to hunt there. 

I would expect an exp group to yield to a high leveller wanting a quest
item (maybe even work out some reciprocal work-together arrangement)

Then again, it really depends on the situation, as there exceptions to
every occurrence.


General rule of thumb I live by, is first come, first served. EXP can be
had just about anywhere, so the only contention in loot. The only reason
to camp loot is to better your chars: Whether this is for personal use,
to sell to get plat to buy other stuff, to improve your other twinks, to
improve your groupmates or guildies, it doesn't really matter.

In your specific case, ask politely if that farmer would let you camp
one of the rooms for exp and the loot there for one of your
groupmembers. If he doesn't yield, go somewhere else and wait until he's
gone. Loot is generally infinite, your time isn't, so don't bother
wasting it fighting over junk - go somewhere else and have fun
