I'm not claiming that I am the only reason for this...but I did /bug it this
past Sunday.

- Pet sit button will now change to stand button if the pet is already
sitting.

And I'm not sure if I suggested this one too or not, but I know MANY were
probably wanting it & there was likely MANY asking for it (possibly a reason
I might have decided not to suggest it, knowing many were).  I'm glad it's
back.  Helps with medding from 0% mana, though I've realized "Dark Pact"
drains HP at the same rate as healing revives them if you're sitting, so my
mana goes up allot faster.

- /Gems is now available in both User Interfaces.
