I've been away from the newsgroup for some time now but I've trolled long 
enough to remember the height of the Peace & Happiness (morse code, Avenger, 
whatever) postings.  Damn, these postings bring back memories.

Now it seems that during the months that Peace & Happiness has been in 
hiding, 
Tony has managed to find out about sites that provide USENET access through 
HTTP.  Well done.  I'm amazed you had the intelligence for it.

It appears that finishing Jr. High managed to bring up your spelling skills.
 
You should be proud of that accomplishment.  I, for one, got tired of 
reading 
your phonetic postings.

Well, here's a toast to seeing more of your insightful commentary - May you 
never grow up for then I would have no one to laugh at in A.G.E.
