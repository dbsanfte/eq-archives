I have, thus far, been the recipient of 3 CS rezzes.  Each time, they were
fast, and courteous.  In two of the three cases, I had reported, then
petitioned, in all three cases I was polite, and was quite happy with the
results.  One of them, I did not get a response when I first petitioned at
12:30AM their time, but got a quick response in the morning when I
petitioned again.  In one of those cases, I probably did not deserve the rez
to be honest.
