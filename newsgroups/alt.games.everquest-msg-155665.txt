You thought even the NPC's would fall over themselves for you cuz shes
"female"? :)

I had a funny incident a long time ago...  female cleric, Id raided with her
guild like once, helped pull it/do the breakin cr (thats PoF for ya).  I
logged into BW and she was there, said hi, hugged me, smiled at me etc etc
(I wasnt even really sure who it was)
So I said "great to see you again :)  Gonna go exp at the giant fort now"

So she followed me.. hmm..  then I went to karnors, again she followed,
still being pretty flirty with the emotes (that kindof blatancy doesnt
appeal to me, I figure id just be 1 of a hundred other guys.. so it didnt
get much of a reacion)

We were grouped for a few hours and it continued.. and then the "bombshell"

cleric tells you... "i have something to tell you"
you tell cleric "ok.."
cleric tells you.. "your such a nice guy bla bla.. I can't lie to you
anymore.. listen im really a guy.  im not gay or anything, I just really
like you.. I dont mind roleplaying a female for you though, I think I can do
a good job of it for you"
cleric tells you, "hello!?"
cleric tells you, "you mad at me?"
cleric tells you, "hello!????"

I never even really knew the person.. and needless to say, we didn't keep in
touch again after that
