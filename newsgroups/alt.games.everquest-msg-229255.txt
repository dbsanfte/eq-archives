Drops of quest armor on KD are quite rare, although they do happen off 
pretty much any giant in the place.  Favorite spot for most people to 
hunt them in a single group is the bank, the entrance mobs seem to drop 
even more rarely than the rest.  However, most drops are gotten in the 
arena; not because the drop rate is any better, though, so much as 
because its normally a much stronger force hunting there, taking down 
many more mobs per hour.

Best single group plan for you would be to get a group together with no 
other leather classes in it (so you get all the leather that drops, if 
any) and then do the bank.

Best plan for getting armor, though, would be to join raids in the 
arena, again preferably with as few other leather classes as possible.

Or, to make money elsewhere, and buy MQ of the leather quest pieces.

You probably -can- solo at either the entrance from WL or the bridges 
just in from EW, but I think it will be slow going and as I said, the 
drop rate off the lower level giants is really very slow.

Splendid
