Well I got my copy of EQ from a highstreet Electronics Boutique but you're 
right - everywhere here seems out of stock at the moment including internet 
mail-order places like Amazon. I guess the UK aren't getting any new copies 
of EQ until Luclin is released, at which point there will no doubt be a 
deluxe edition for people without an existing account.

Since you used to have EQ, you presumably already have an account that just 
needs reactivating - so you may not need to buy a new CD for an account 
key. If you can get an installation up and running somehow you can probably 
just log in with your old username and password and stick in your current 
credit card details (you may find your characters wiped of course, but 
probably not). In theory you could just have someone email you the patch 
program and then download the entire CD contents via the patcher (not 
really worth the trouble unless you have broadband).

Failing that, wait a month and the new improved Luclin version of EQ will 
be in a store near you.
