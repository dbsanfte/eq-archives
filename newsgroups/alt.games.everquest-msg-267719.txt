If they have social aggro, they'll aggro on anyone regardless
of where they are.  Social aggro range is relatively small
however.

His breaking the lock doesn't lose aggro -- he'd have to
zone or die or run out of aggro range to do that.  In my
experience they'll follow him until one of those happens.
Once it does, they'll start to path back to their spawn
area and can possibly social aggro someone else.
They generally run back, too -- or warp back if they
were ran quite a way.
