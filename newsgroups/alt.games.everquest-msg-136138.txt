The biggest difference is that DAoC is oriented toward PvR (player vs.
realm), while EQ is oriented toward PvE (player vs. environment).  If you
want to fight other players in large battles as part of the team, DAoC wins.
If you want to take 20 people and go raid a dungeon, EQ wins.  The DAoC
dungeons are small (but visually quite good looking...they have a great
dungeon feel).

DAoC now also has a couple of PvP servers, where the realm war is gone, and
it is straight PvP.  Those are the most popular servers.  (Which bodes well
for Shadowbane, I suppose...looks like a lot of people like PvP).

Purely from a game mechanics point of view, DAoC is better.  The way each
class has several lines of spells or abilities that you choose via training
points gives great flexibility, and the way items wear out and nothing is NO
DROP works out very well.

Note that in EQ, all you need to do is find a small group of people who
aren't idiots to be happy.  In DAoC, with things taking place on a larger
scale, you've correspondingly got a harder time finding non-idiots.  This
showed up dramtically in the first couple of months, when people were
whining all the time about archers killing them on the frontiers.  Why were
archers killing them?  Because they had no one to hunt down and remove the
archers.  Why not?  Because the classes that are good at that aren't the
best in XP groups, and so (1) not many people wanted to play them, and (2)
everyone else wouldn't let them into their groups so they gave up.  For DAoC
to work well, you need players who realize that what's important is the good
of their realm, not just how fast they personally are getting XP.

Right now, however, if I could only play one game, it would be Neverwinter
Nights.  I'm currently only playing the single player game (level 17
Barbarian in Chapter 3), but I see a lot of third party modules already,
mostly designed for multiplayer.  It's just such a pleasure to play with a
well thought out and *documented* gaming system (NWN is 3rd Edition D&D
rules, with just minor mods).  I love being able to make decisions about my
character and actually feel like I made an intelligent decision, instead of
just guessing.  Both EQ and DAoC hide too much.
