Sure is, but then again very few people realize that Shamans even has
the SoW....at least in my experience.

My Barbarian Shaman has only rarely been bugged for buffs and SoW, not
that I mind though ... ;o)

...on the other hand, it makes the buff-on-the-run much more funny to
do, as the 'victims' sometimes wonder where that came from.

As to the 'warding off beggars', Ive always considered the character
asking for a buff. Low levels get them if I have the time or the mana
- if not I simply request that they wait until Im ready. If they are
patient - theyll get the buffs - if theyre not, theyll run off.

As to higher levels - well that depends on the way the request is put
to me - 'SoW PLZ' requests are usually not answered. People with long
EQ experience should be able to phrase a proper request, as well as to
understand why a request might be refused. (eBayers are the exception
to that of course) 

As I see it, politeness goes a long way - and its amazingly
inexpensive too :o)

Good Hunting All.
