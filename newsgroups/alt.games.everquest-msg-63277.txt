You've been playing this long and you still think guides get paid? And
on occasion, they *do* actually do useful stuff for players, within
their limited powers. Bigger stuff they forward to the server GM's (who
*do* get paid) after filtering out the bullshit. If it weren't for the
guides, you'd never talk to a GM and you could just try to handle
everything through the phone line CS long distance when they have no
fucking 800 number. Want something to bitch about? There's one for ya.

Me and most all of the solo classes have a percentage that know about
what a great zone OoT is from 12 to twenty. Sisters, Sirens, aqua
goblins.. all doable at 12. Later on Isle goblins, chickens, and gargs.
Plenty of level 12's in OoT every time I log on in there.
