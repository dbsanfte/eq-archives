I like the little guy.  But I still think project illusion is the best AA
ever, and occasionally /feedback asking for group and MGB illusions, so I
may just be warped.

I can confirm this.  I duo a lot with a shaman friend, and we both are
comfortable keeping our mana below 50% for long periods of fighting (she has
cannibalize and I have gather mana for emergencies).  The Jester fills one
of us up on one stat maybe 1.5 times per use - sometimes 2 or 3, occasionally
not at all.

It's a nice bonus to the giggles at being turned into giant or tiny versions
of common zone mobs.

>Still the worst vetreward ever, IMO

From a power standpoint, true.  It's the least boring one, though.  At least
they tried to add some fun and whimsy :)
