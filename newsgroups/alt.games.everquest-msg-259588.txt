I have and older box with a 5200, and it works in EQ but its not great. 
(The 5200FX is not a great card, as I'm sure you know.)

The 5700FX should be a much better card.

Couple things to check:

1) Get the latest drivers direct from nvidia, and give those a shot.

2) Are the missing features completely white are are they just 
'whitewashed' and you can make them out if you get closer. Does the 
missing feature problem only affect character models, char+mob, 
everything...??

Check your clipping plane settings and set them to far to see if it 
makes a difference. I've noticed that the 5200FX card with various 
driver versions 'fogs to white' when it shouldn't and even does it  
piecemeal ... the head is clear as day, but the arms are fogged almost 
to white... etc.

3) How much RAM do you have? As someone else suggested try turning the 
'new' models off and see if that makes a difference (even if you have 
lots of RAM give it a try just to see what happens.).

4) What OS are you using? XP?

5) The mobo you mention: p4c800 is a good one, and unless its actually 
defective shouldn't be the source of your problems, but as others have 
said, make sure you have installed the drivers. (The ones on the CD 
should be fine for a start.

6) What happens if you put the gf3 back in? Same thing?
