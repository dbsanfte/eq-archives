And the thing is... Now that we've played EQ (I've been playing since 
release day, too), no other MMORPG will give us the same thrill. The 
biggest challenge would be to see in which aspects it diverges from EQ, 
and compensate for them. I don't think anybody moving to DAoC from EQ 
had anything near a similar thrill the first day.
