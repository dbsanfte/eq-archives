AMD 900 tbird here, no problems with any games. However, make sure you
research problems associated with the motherboard chipset and the hardware
you will be using. I had a hell of a time getting my graphics card,
soundcard, and USB to work with an ASUS A7V mobo using a VIA chipset. Lots
of people are saying stay away from VIA, while others have no problems.
