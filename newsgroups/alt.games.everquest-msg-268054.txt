No, of course not. You can be purely and adventurer without
tradeskilling. Conversely, you can supposedly be purely a tradeskiller
without adventuring. (ALthough, as I understand it, adventuring would
help in safely getting to those higher level nodes if you don't want
to have to buy the resources off others)
