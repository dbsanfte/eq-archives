Doc,

Your friend is a bit off.  Here's the scoop.

A Fuligan (sp) Stone of Innoruk is the casting component for the spell Alter
Plane:Hate.  One is consumed each time a wizard casts the spell, one stone
per group; similar to the way you eat a peridot when you Virtue.  The only
way to get to Hate without a wizard and the stone is to be ressed in.  It IS
a good idea to keep a spare stone on the bank, however; that way if you die,
you can get a wizard to port you back for corpse recovery without having to
go back to Neriak to get another stone.  I know of no other source than
Neriak 3rd gate - I made a DE mule years ago specifically for the job of
buying Hatestones for my wizard.

Hatestones used to cost 150pp.  The price was reduced, but I forget the
current cost - I believe it's 75pp now.  Half-price flights to Hate - what a
bargain!

Rhian,
65 Wizard
