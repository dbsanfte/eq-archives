    Note that Ray has YET to respond to this in any of his posts. And I
haven't even asked questions like, "How does one excel in a game where PvE
is pointless?" Although that's a personal preference - many will enjoy
playing Capture the Flag.

    Yup. Gives PRESTIGE to items, MEANING. Just like how a title in DAoC
tells everyone "I'm good at this", items in EQ also tell folks about the
character that posesses them. They may not tell the entire story due to
twinking (blurring the line between character and player accomplishments),
but you can be sure that the Cowl of Mortality that guy has on wasn't a
ground spawn (to quote Sang).

    Heh. Again, because you cannot sit at home and click your way to glory
in EQ, you figure it has no economy. Sorry, doesn't follow. And creating a
world where top-end items are so easy to obtain only panders to the min-max
crowd in the worst possible way.

    Let me repeat my point: workable economic system does NOT mean system
that allows for pure tradeskillers. The two are not equivalent, no matter
how much you insist they are.

    Cool. Then when people see you with a lightsabre, they'll know you
earned it. Hey, if they use the DAoC quest system then a whole bunch of
people can earn a lightsabre at once! It would sure beat a Star Wars
universe where everyone was a full-blown Jedi with a lightsabre and complete
suit of Boba Fett armour. There's a name for that - Monty Haul.

    Actually, they're not doing it that way because the lead designer on the
project isn't the same lead as was on EQ. If you think about it,
tradeskillers make a great target audience: they're satisfied by minimal
effort (a few database entries, a random quest generator that can be used
elsewhere as well) by the development team. They use very little of the
content in game, as opposed to PvE players. And testing tradeskill content
is far easier than testing 3D environment interactions. Guess it makes good
financial sense to attract them. 8)
