I just ignore them or tell them to get lost. Sometimes if im feeling nice
Ill hlp them. Fr some reason I tend to be more generous to people of about
my own level hunting in my zone. They also seem to be better mannered than
these yahoos in commons.
What gets up my nose is the "holier than thou"s....

I was sitting outsidew the bank in kelethin on day, medding up to gate back
to RM and farm some more giants. I get a tell from someone asking if they
can get a port. Sure I say, Im porting anyway and I can drop u off for a
mere 10p. Thats agreed, and I begin my job of waiting for "her".

After about 5 minutes, I find out that it is in fact a ggroup of pople, and
they wont be there immediately but soon. Ok I say, ill wait for a little
while, 10p doesnt buy you much time. After another 5 minutes of waiting and
letting them know I have to go, 3 people arrive, but they are still waiting
for the fourth. Apparently she was a dark elf and got killed by the guards,
and now we need to wait for her to get her body (i guess she was bound in
gf).

At that point I just told them to screw the deal and ported out. Why the
heck they couldnt just tell me they had a dark elf so I could come to them.
Anyway I get this tell from this person, proceeding to go on about how my
reputation will stik with me, and how sorry she feels for me.

I wonder if I posted her name in this message, how *her* reputation would go
amoung the druids and wizards on my server.
