Yes, I realise wizard, necro, druid and bards are the main soloers. 
Although, I have a friend who in the past three years has soloed a 
paladin from 1 to 55 but obviously the game has changed since he was in 
his early ages.

I know I can get him to at least 24 as thats where my Paladin is at - 
but I did that a few months ago when it was still easy to get to the 
other side of PC and he could heal himself.
