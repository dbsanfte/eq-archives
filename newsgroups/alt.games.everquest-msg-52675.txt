Damn! I've killed those bastards dozens of times and never seen one!
Then again, I've camped some other stuff for ages and not seen the
"uber_item_01" that drops either. Have to determine if it's worth
dragging the main out there to try again. When I was doing my crafted
armor for my warrior, I must have killed thirty grif's in a row in EK/NK
and never saw the eye I needed. Then a guildie said, "Oh, you need one?
I have one in the bank. Never knew what it was for. Just dropped on one
of the first ones I killed."
*sigh*
