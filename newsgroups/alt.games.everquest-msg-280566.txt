It should also be said that, if the opposite is true and you want to force an entirely
fresh download of every bleedin' file in the EverQuest directory, you can delete
everything except EVERQUEST.EXE.

When you run EVERQUEST.EXE inside an otherwise empty folder, a complete re-download will
commence.

I have no idea how long this takes over a 1.5MB/s DSL connection because I went to bed
almost immediately thereafter :>
