They keep trying to make this line appealing, but thus far I'm still
underwhelmed.  Tell you what would help a -lot-... make the spell pop up
normally after memming, kill that incredibly long recast time.  I can't spare a
slot to dedicate to DI (I sure couldn't spare it for DP) to leave sit there for
when I want to cast it, and I can't mem it, cast it, forget it like with other
buffs.  So the only way to use it is with advance planning, knowing I want it
for mob X and getting it ready in advance, or making everyone wait for it to
pop.  Since its pretty much a shot in the dark as to whether it will work, and
has little effect when it does (one CHeal?  The MA is getting one of those every
4 seconds already!)  I can't see asking anyone to wait till its ready.

Didn't they have this before, and then patch it away?  Maybe not.  Whats this
help with, anyway, keeping tabs to see if one of your healers is being lazy?  DO
they have messages saying Wizardman nuked for 500, but Elf shot the food?  My
troll shaman will be glad of this, though, now he'll know who to yell at when he
gets those silly "you have been healed for 33 points" messages... Stop healing
the Shaman, silly ranger!

Well, this was clearly a bug, but it sure saved lives; not running off and
finding more mobs was nice.  That said, I don't think it was being fair to the
mobs, they really do flee when we fear them, not just stand around as if mezzed.
Guess its back to SOW off and Walk on for encounters with mobs that fear eh?

Wow that would suck, good thing its been ages since I last fear kited, so I
missed this glitch completely.

Never saw this one, but it probably did suck a lot.  Hmm, no one ever said I
cast atone while LD, wonder if they remembered that enchanters aren't the only
ones with a mem blur line?  Not that I normally have Atone memmed, but
sometimes...

Some say bug, others say exploit... I never noticed either problem or advantage
with this, but had some people say that they could use a insta clicky to refresh
recast times on spells at a vast improvement to their DPS over short periods (of
course running out of mana sooner too)

Mark of Karn is useful only as a PL tool, or for fast hitting people on low
level mobs, or, 99% of the time, as a DS remover.  If MoKings is now faster
csating or cheaper casting than MoKarn, it will be a more attractive DS remover,
if not, I'll stick with MoKarn.  Duration is not a factor, once the DS is gone
its gone, I've never seen a mob recast one in a fight, and don't know, if one
did, if it would be prevented by having MoKings up or not.

If they want it to be useful as a sort of heal, they need a significantly larger
heal component, when mobs are hitting you for 500+ a pop, AE nuking for 500+,
then getting this tiny amount of hp back per hit is about as useful as a level 5
cleric standing there chain casting minor healing.

Doh, never heard that one, would have sucked though.  Guess I'll go right out
and by my shaman twink a horse now and test this out!

Good, I find it really annoying to get innaccurate information from the game on
this sort of thing.  If a mob is highly resistant, it should give you a
different message from when its immune, and if its immune, it shouldn't say it
-is- affected when its not!

There was a limit?  Doh!
