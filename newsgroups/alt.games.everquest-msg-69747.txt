I really had not used the spell but once and for free since it requires a
druid in wolf form to buy the spell and the mana line of  5 spells probably
cost 50 plus pp for one use. And when I tried to buy them (in the brownie
viallage I was quickly killed).  There are 5 spells in the mana line and I
only have 3. I have tried to get the spells on occasion but have never been
able to get the druid or the wolf form to work with me - possibly religion
or factions. So after a cr gave up.
