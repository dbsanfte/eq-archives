Hey um, do smithy hammers sit in pri or secondary melee slots while you're
using them or do you chuck them in the forge like other tradeskills seem to
operate (tailoring and fletching tools). Was wondering because people have
been suggesting I get int items for my DE alt that are pri or secondary slot
and it wouldnt help him any if i had to remove them to use a smithy hammer
down the track.
