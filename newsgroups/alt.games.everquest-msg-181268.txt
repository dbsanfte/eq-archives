    Been there done that heaps, EQ Atlas maps arent interactive and dont
show me with a little positional cursor where my character is. Yes you can
use /loc constantly but that's NOT quick and for safety's sake... gasp.....
you still have (had) to navigate by landmarks.

    And, apparently even a Chimpanzee can be taught to regurgitate it every
time someone points a complete piece of shit out that sony's added to make
EQ ever increasingly the video game it never should have been. The slight
problem with sticking my head in the sand and not using the feature is that
every moron and his dog will be using it and ill be disadvantaged by
comparison. You bet your unoriginal ass ill use this feature to its maximum
advantage, my argument is, however, that it never should've been added.

    What the hell does it *Add* to the game?! It makes something easier,
that's it. More children and idiots can play EQ now - more money for Sony,
grouping gets that little bit extra dangerous :P
