Something about WoW I just read and was pondering:

They have enchanting as a tradeskill (you can enchant
stuff in the trade window, so folks don't have to
blindly give you money and their gear - the enchantment
finishes only when both people trade).

The very first level of it gives you the ability to
disenchant magic items for reagents for new enchantments.

Given that they have soulbound (no-drop) gear, I was thinking
that it would behoove everyone to get the first level (beginner)
of this -- then, when your soulbound gear is replaced by new
stuff, at least you can break it down and sell the reagents.

If they added a similar skill to tradeskills in EQ (*)- it could return
components needed in later tradeskill recipes.

*  Smithing would allow you to dis-assemble weapons and plate/chain
armor.  Tailoring would allow cloth/leather armors.  Jewelcraft for
rings/earrings etc.

Along with tribute, it could be a way to remove extraneous magic items
permanently from the game.

Is it a dumb idea, or does it have a glimmer of potential?
