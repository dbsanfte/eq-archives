Well you have DA, invisibility, snare, slow.. that makes a lot of things
trivial :)

Obviously for my monk its trivial (I think the same goes for any melee
class).. I'd run through with my cleric if I couldn't be lazy (level 60,
divine barrier, good heal..) - and with my wizard (59 with epic) i wouldn't
fret either..

but on my magician,  if the seahorses were up and i was alone..  no way
would I try swimming across.  whether he was 60 (hes 54 atm still) with nice
gear, I still wouldn't try and run him through
