The actual meaning *is* what people think it means in almost every
context we would ever use in this group. Language is a tool for
communicating concepts, and the reason you're not talking archaic
middle english is that it develops and grows over time and as circumstances
change.

I personally think the attempts of certain countries (such as France)
to formally preserve the heritage of their language in current use
and static definition by legislating against colloquialisms and the
integration of foreign words are immensely sad, wrong headed and
doomed to failure. 

Now, that doesn't mean I dont see value in education, precision,
or beauty in archaic forms, but it does mean I think you need to
take a slightly more pragmatic approach to the fundamental nature
of what language actually is.

Ohhhg. I'm dribbling now; If you're interested in a "popular science"
meandering introduction to the nature of language Stephen Pinker
does some interesting stuff.
