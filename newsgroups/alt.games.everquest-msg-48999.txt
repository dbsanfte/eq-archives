National Day of Driving with Headlights On

       Please join us and PLEASE forward this email
 immediately to everyone in your address book asking
 them to also forward it.
       We have 2 days and counting to get the word out
 all across this great land we love and call the United
 States of America.   Let's see how powerful email can
 be!

       THE PROGRAM IS THIS:  On Thursday, October 11th,
 2001, have everyone in the USA who will be driving a
 motor vehicle that day drive with their headlights on
 during daylight hours.  This will be the 30th day
 commemoration in honor of our fallen friends
 desecrated by the terrorists' attacks on NYC, the
 Pentagon, and the highjacked plane that crashed in PA.
 The purpose of driving with headlights on this day
 will:
        1)Show our respect, friendship, and tribute
          to all of those individuals who lost their
         lives on that dreadful September 11, 2001
 day.
       2)Show our concern for the family members of
          those individuals.
        3)Show those uncouth terrorists that the fabric
          of the USA is stronger than steel.
        4)Show that we Americans have solidarity
          standing shoulder to shoulder against any
          terrorists' acts upon the USA.

 You can probably add others to this list.  Your
 contribution by sending this email on to others is
 greatly appreciated; many thanks to you.  May God
 bless America.
