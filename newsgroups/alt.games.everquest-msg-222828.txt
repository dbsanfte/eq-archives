Is there a master list out there (hopefully on a forum or site) that
lists zones with their corresponding XP bonuses? I've only been able
to dig up this:

Droga increased by 12%
Nurga increased by 12%
Solusek's Eye (SolA) increased by 13%
Najena increased by 13%
Befallen increased by 13%
Paw increased by 13%
Permafrost increased by 13%
Kaesora increased by 18%
Qeynos Catacombs increased by 20%
Runnyeye increased by 20%
Kerra Ridge increased by 20%
The Hole increased by 25%


But these are only the increases SoE has made and not the actual
values themselves (unless these were given the standard bonus prior to
this upgrade).

Thanks.
