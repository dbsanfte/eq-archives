Isn't it possible to play two separate accounts with EQW and therefore be 
able to PL yourself without the need of a second computer? (and be able 
to therefore sign on a friend's account without haveing to purchase a 
second one)  Just wonderin, if so that might be a reason.  Plus they are 
self righteous bastards that are drunk on their own power.  That'd be my 
reason.
