Yes it is.  All Fine Plate armor is first smithed (without color), and
then as an additional step is (optionally) dyed.  It can be dyed
immediately, or two years later, it doesn't matter.

The only warning is that once it is dyed, it's permanent -- you can't
"undye" it, nor dye it a different color.

Also, the dying process can not possibly damage the armor.  If the
operation fails, the dye components are lost, but the (still undyed)
armor is left unharmed and you can get more dye components and try
again.  There is no risk.
