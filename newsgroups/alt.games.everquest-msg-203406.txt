I've been losing interest in the game again lately but my main and
highest level character is only a 37 druid.  Should I hold on until
50?  Do things really get much more exciting?  The repitition is
killing me right now and I don't like tradeskills and most quests
involve too much camping for my part time play style.

I played a wizard to 24 and mostly felt like I didn't contribute
the same DPS to long-term exp grinds as monks.  My perception may
have been wrong though.  If I dust my wizard off and play again
I'll pay more attention.  For the moment I'll assume you're right
since you're much more experienced.
