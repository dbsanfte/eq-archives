    Been posting since '96 actually, and no, despite how common the practise
of "flaming" is, I don't have to accept it. One thing I dont like about the
Internet is that it lets people who would otherwise be polite, be rude, and
people just accept it.

    Not that I think you were so, or especially so, but somehow we're on
this topic...

    Well, to answer your question then... no I wouldn't put myself in that
faction. I tend to look at each new enhancement on its merits, but I *do*
see an apparently accelerating trend towards making the game *Easier*
without any thought to making it more *fun*.

    Everquest is a hard game... that's one reason I actually bother playing
it. You can't learn 3 things and walk all over it for a week then get bored
and quit. And Oh Lordy does it ever punish stupidity. When I do something
dumb, I usually get killed. And when a stupid jerk does something that
pisses me off, I usually have a bit of a giggle and make a personal bet as
to how long before some hideous monster takes revenge for me.

    In a modern world that at times seems to almost idolise stupidity,
something that actually smacks it down is a welcome relief to me.

    Getting yourself and your corpse lost ARE game enhancements, unless you
mean a bug did it. Perhaps if there was a stage where necros and SK's
couldn't locate corpse or summon corpse, maybe it sucked unnecesarily then,
but now all it takes is a little interraction with another human in the game
(which is a GREAT thing) and maybe a little money if you can afford it. I
mean, you knew that, maybe you were talking about some distant time when
nobody had locate corpse or something.
