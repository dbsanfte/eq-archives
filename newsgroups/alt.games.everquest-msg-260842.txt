As you saw (but I'm including it for folks who haven't seen it), at the
end of the 4th set of 100 turn-ins, you get a message like this one for
the Smithing quests:

    Snokin Breaksteel says 'No more work now.  Snokin happy wit what you
    do already.  Snokin show you secret now.  You not tell anyone!'
    Snokin looks around furtively, as if everyone on the ship doesn't
    hear everything he says.  He hands you a piece of paper with some
    very precise writing on it.  You can only guess that he did not write
    it.  You look it over and you understand the mothods for smelting the
    aligned ore and the shimmering aligned ore.  It's not a complicated
    process, but you would have needed information that only the
    Wayfarers have to uncover it.  Now all you need to do is place the
    ore into a forge and you will be able to make the steel.  However,
    you are certain that you can improve the process if you work with the
    ore long enough.  Snokin takes the paper back and pulls out a ledger.
    You see him carefully note your name on the ledger with clear and
    concise penmanship that matches that on the paper you just read.'

Not being at a level where I can go collect the ore, I haven't actually
tried this, but I assume my character is somehow flagged as being able to
do this recipe; whether it's on my recipe search list yet or not I don't
know.

According to the EQtraders site, I'll start out getting 1 and sometimes 2
steel per ore, whereas I could just give the ore to Snokin and get 2 every
time.  But if I do it enough myself, I'll eventually make 2 every time and
occasionally 3, and even reach the point where I always make 3.  This
variable-yield recipe is something I haven't seen elsewhere, so I assume
they added some sort of special-case code to do it.
