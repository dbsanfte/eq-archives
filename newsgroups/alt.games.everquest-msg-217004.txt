Any ever get an Exception 10H error when trying to run EQ or other
programs that use DirectX and your video card?

The information about it on the Microsoft support homepage and
generally on the web don't help at all in determining the real cause
or even a possible fix.

The error has been randomly attributed to several different things,
and I have tried every solution I have come across to no avail.

I have reinstalled EQ, Video drivers, DirectX 8.1 up to DirectX 9,
reformatted the entire HD EQ was on and reinstalled everything from
scratch. Every once in a while I perform some random act that elimates
the Exception 10H error, but I can't seem to pinpoint the exact cause
so I can eliminate it altogether.

Any ideas and possible solutions are greatly appreciated. Thanks in
advance.
