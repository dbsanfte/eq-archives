I've seen an uberguild ogre twink warrior who didn't have the sense to
take shrink potions to sol B, causing massive trains and multiple
deaths for others. At one point, while he was stuck on a feigned monk
at the entrance, he wanted to fight a train instead of zone. Who cared
if nobody else could zone because he was standing there?
