No lower than 60.

Seriously, wisdom isn't really all that important, it determines your mana
pool, but not your mana regen rate.

Look into various Focus items, which save you mana by making your spells
cast more cheaply, or buffs last longer, or nukes or DOTs do more damage.

Further, look at Flowing Thought (which regens your mana directly) and
Regeneration (which gives you HP regen which you are busily converting
into mana)

Additionally, HP and Stamina gear tend to be more effective than wisdom
gear; HP gives you a bigger reserve when you happen to get beat on, and
you'll be converting HP into mana for regen purposes, then healing (or
regenning) the lost HP up for less mana cost than you gained.  This means
that HP (and STA which gives more HP) are dual purpose stats, while Wisdom
contributes nothing but mana pool, and a slightly higher learning rate if
its higher than your int.

All that said, Wisdom and Mana gear are also on the "get some" list
eventually, when it starts to be cheaper to add more mana than to add more
HP.
