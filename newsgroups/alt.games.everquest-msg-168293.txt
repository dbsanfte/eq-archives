yeah it would be nice if they had a line in spell info when you right

Spirit of Wolf increases your running speed by (and puts the amount it 
does here)

It is hard to find a good free tip site, best ones being castersrealmz 
eqatlas,and allakhazam. I got everquest last year and along with it i 
got the SOL guide, when tring to get to most of the sites they listed i 
really was SOL. I read around before tring any of the classes to a great
