... This was in response to the Sol Ro comment? You don't need a major
raiding guild to get into Sol Ro. I did it on my main *WITHOUT GUILD*
back when I was told it flat out was impossible. And that was without
being an app or member of any guild or open raid running each event,
like 2 months of backbreaking work start to finish. Now, the only
*hard* part today is getting the RZTW flag. That's either finding an
open raid that actually knows what they're doing(nearly impossible but
i've seen it work with the right people in charge), or apping an
elemental or time level guild doing backflags long enough to get on a
successful RZTW raid. Hedges can be a bit of a pain to organize but
not impossible. You put in the work and voila, welcome to TSR. Most
everything other than RZTW or maybe MM is open raided a LOT. But, if
you don't want to put in the effort to get the flaggage, and you DO
have to be pro-active, yeah.. go farm Hill Giants for chump change I
guess. And yeah.. TSR is just a matter of rolling high on either a
Turban(10K) or a Greaves Mold(120K) when they decide they want to
drop. I've won both on main floor TSR and sold both at said price, it
just depends on your luck that night.

Either way, an individual getting their TSR flag has nothing to do
with *building* a major raiding guild. They are two completely
seperate things.
