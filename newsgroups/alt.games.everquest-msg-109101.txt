As I've said, the various windows in fullscreen mode don't impare
visibility for me at all. *shrug* I don't see what the huge problem
is. I can see through them just fine on medium-transparancy. There is
a *slightly* wider range of visibility in fullscreen mode, as well (or
so it appears. I haven't actually *tested* it definately).

I've seen no noticeable change in frame lag in the higher resolutions,
personally...
