Is this what Ben Sisson would call dumbing down the raid game so that 
raiders don't have to think? ;)

See you came up with a general stategy which works for all variations. 
Bravo. :) Although I blame SOE for making it so trivial. If it were =me= 
I'd make the spawn non-targetable until the cragbeast was down, because 
I'd WANT the raid to learn to cope with the possibility of 'radically 
different mobs'.

This is definately a problem in the raid game, and one of the reasons I 
hated the raid game. It is why I'd like to see a much greater focus on 
one group encounters. Its much easier to select 6 people, and keep them 
focussed at the task at hand... with 50+ somebody is -always- afk, 
answering the phone, eating pizza, ...

This is simple: easy raids with greater or equal rewards > hard raids 
for equal reward. The problem is one of itemization more than anything 
else.

No player, at any stage of the game is going see much value to working 
twice as hard for the same reward. This isn't a raid phenomena, its 
manifest in the entire game... people go where the best loot they can 
obtain is. If the best loot they can obtain drops in multiple places 
they do the easiest one.

That is clearly your opinion. I disagree that it need be true. I would 
be quite comfortable with running multiple strategies depending on what 
happens.

In small-full group situations this is very often the case. Every add 
has to be assessed and dealt with according to what it is, be it a 
caster, a summoner, a mezzer, a healer, ... some you ignore; some you 
gang on, some you kite, some you offtank, some you can mez, you don't 
know what's going to happen next, and its a lot of fun, and challenging 
every time you run through.

In Grage's tale, perhaps he should just have refused to go anywhere 
until he had 6 man group with the holy trilogy at the core... and then 
you wouldn't even need dynamic strategy or tactics; the same basic strat 
works for anything then ... there would be no need for a zerker to kite 
around...

What a yawn that is though. And SOE needs to create more dyanmic stuff 
not less.

In EQ raiding suprises interesting enough to make note of usually equal 
a wipe, at least for as long as they are 'surprises'.

Split the healers, expect to sac half of them. Or clue the healers into 
the mob's ability to move, and get them keeping an eye so they can move 
out of the way. ... point being it will take a few attempts to even 
learn what it can do at each stage... just because you beat it once 
doesn't mean you've 'mastered' it.

What are you saying? That everyone should count! But that the raid 
shouldn't pivot on each individual not screwing up?

Seems incompatible to me. Doesn't 'Counting' imply that your actions are 
important. If screwing up doesn't cause a wipe then your actions can't 
really count for much.

That's an assumption that I disagree with. Requiring a random number of 
people in the raid react to something is better than nobody having to 
react to something. At any rate I fail to see why this need be an all or 
nothing case. Most raids are already fairly boring, because not 
everybody needs to react to much.

There are already many pivotal roles on good raids. And even old dull 
raids have more than a couple. Why shouldn't later raids have ever more 
pivots?

Why?.. because players will hate it. Right! I forgot that end game 
raiders don't want to be challenged. 

Its funny though, I belong to family guilds now, and they wipe all the 
time to old hat raids even those with simple strats. Why? Because family 
guilds invariably have a few clueless idiots who can't play their class 
worth beans and go afk at inappropriate times and what not else; people 
who can almost be counted upon to bungle something and accidently yank 
aggro from the MT or go oom without letting anyone know etc...


[As an aside - its maddening really... its brutal to find a good casual 
guild with real enforced member competency requirements, without that 
guild losing focus of its desire to remain a casual guild.]

I liked the idea of the opening system. I never saw it in action so I 
dont know about the implementation.... and I'm firmly in the camp where 
I expect a mmorpg to be about player skill at setting up his avatar not 
player twitch.

Guess its not itemized well enough for the effort. Its funny how 'the 
plague' in EQ can be cured by the drop of hat, or particularly nice 
helmet...

You appear to want 'complex looking encounters' that are in fact really 
easy to beat once you know the trick.

Is that really the game you want?

If so my allusion to 80's side scrolling bosses was bang on.

Myself I was -always- disappointed when I found out the end boss could 
be defeated easily ... where instead of dodging the tentacles, laser 
beams, homing missiles, and periodic death-ray blast while inflicting 
damage as fast you could until one of you died... it turned out there 
was a safe spot in some corner where nothing would hit you, from which 
you could continually fire off homing missiles for 5 or 6 minutes that 
would eventually destroy it... for me finding that spot was a big let 
down.

But it sounds like you hate any encounter which SOE fails to allow for 
an analog of that safe place and simple strategy. If that's the sort of 
player EQ caters to, colour me unimpressed.

Suddenly I'm particularly disillusioned with EQ; here =I= was looking 
=forward= to the complex encounters, but it appears my point of view is 
unique ... my compatriots would rather make themselves feel big by 
beating scripted encounters over and over again in exactly the same way, 
and are actively pressuring SOE not to make encounters that require much 
thought. But I'd like a non sissy game with complex looking encounters 
that are actually complex, even after you've beaten them once.

No offense is intended. I'm just perpetually frustrated at what I 
consider the ass-backwards direction EQ design appears to be taking... 
particularly when something I view as a positive move is 'hated' by the 
raiders... because... gasp... it makes the game "too hard" for its so-
called best players.

I thought GoD and PoP "progression" and the flagging is *extremely* 
irritating, but the encounters themselves have never bothered me (beyond 
my utter inability to join raids at 4am, and my irriatation at being 
blocked from *my* progression by my inability to find a pile of other 
people. A group sure... but 50 people? Ridiculous.... but that's a 
separate rant.)
