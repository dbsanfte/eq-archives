I would argue lazy coding was a primary driver for going with zones
over sectors. With zones, as you said, it's easier to split them up
across server farms, less work for level designers so their areas don't
have to exactly match up (that fudge factor mentioned elsewhere),
easier mob AI and pathing, and so on. That they went the extra distance
on the AI and pathing in EQ2, made these gigantic zones, had adjacent
zones visible (or more likely polygons from adjacent zones up to n
zones away included at the edges of any given zone) to give a greater
illusion of continuity yet STILL HAVE zones is what boggles me. My
guess is they couldn't figure out how to do it right - have certain
sectors shared between servers and run in parallel, so the handoff from
one to the other happens in the background keeping the player from ever
knowing it was happening. Bonus, you have extra-stable areas where two
servers are simultaneously handling traffic, so if one goes down the
other keeps on chugging.

Easily said, probably a bear to implement. But so is a 3D immersive
MUD. I know it can be done. I'm pretty certain that's how Project
Entropia handles things, preventing any visible zone walls. I think
PlaneShift might also work this way, though it's small enough it might
actually all fit on one large server. I don't know.

Xiphos - Realized I'd been using "quadrant" incorrectly, so I switched
to sectors. I forget what the proper technical term for breaking large
maps up into several smaller chunks is called.
