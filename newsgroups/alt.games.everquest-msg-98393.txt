: You don't remember the first time you hit level 10?

The first time I hit 9 was important to me.

The first time I hit 14 was important to me.

10 wasn't too important.

My first character was a wood elf druid.  :)

My second character was a mage.  With my mage, the first time
I hit 8 was important, and the first time I hit 12 was also
important.  10 wasn't too important.

Is 10 an important level for any class?  Maybe bards...
