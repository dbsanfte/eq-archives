I just got daul weild and put a bunch of practice points in it. I like
it. Of course I'm taking more damage, but dishing it out faster. My
concern is my one hand blunt, it's poor, very poor. I'd like to raise
it and still stay alive. If I put a blunt weapon in the secondary slot
will the one hand blunt skill go up? Do I need to put it in the
primary slot for it to go up?

I got a couple items to increase my str. My primary weapon damage
however hasn't gone up. What am I missing here?

Is there some kind of chart somewhere to tell me what the faction
numbers mean in terms of something more useful? I mean is there a cap
on the high end. Is there a way to know how these numbers relate to
how a certain group will interact with me. This would be great because
then it would give me an idea of how much effort to put into any one
set of faction numbers.
