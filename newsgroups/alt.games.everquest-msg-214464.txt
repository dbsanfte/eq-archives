The basic game available in the UK is now this:

Everquest New Dawn-UK Server Edition: EverQuest-UK; Ruins of Kunark; The
Scars of Velious; The Shadows of Luclin

http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006YZ7N/qid=1063202603/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3_3/202-6672010-4315804

(Go to Amazon.co.uk and enter Everquest in the search box!)

This gives you the basic game plus the first 3 expansions for 24.99. The
latest expansions (Planes of Power, Legends of Ykesha, Lost Dungeons of
Norrath) are available separately. The basic setup is more than adequate for
deciding if you like the game, though some useful features were added in the
later expansions (in-game mapping in Ykesha, better transportation in Planes
of Power).

I believe you still get 1 month's free gameplay thrown in, though you do
have to "subscribe" to use it.
