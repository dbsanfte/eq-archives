My shaman is a troll.  I did this because he got regen and mainly because
he could get a neck item that gives him a clicky snare.  The regen is
nice, the clicky snare, though, is rarely worth using.  I'd switch to Ogre
shaman, after some consideration, because the regen really doesn't mean
much in a class with regen spells and Stoicism; its a trickle added to a
raging torrent of HP regen, and there's a big exp penalty for being a
troll; ogres have a smaller penalty but are immune to stuns from mobs in
front of them; it turns out that in 52 levels I spent well over 90% of my
time with a mob hitting me from the front, I'd get use out of that ability
every day.  Ogres also have higher starting stamina, which would mean more
HP, a resource I use constantly.

I'd say 25 in STA and the rest in wis; depth of mana pool has never
mattered much to my shaman, who's more likely to run out of HP than mana
by a long shot, and being a shaman means not only getting beat on, but
trading HP for mana and then buying HP back with the mana and pocketing
the difference.

Focus items first and foremost, after that, HP, then STA, then Wis, after
which, hmm, I guess what color it is would be more interesting than any
other stat.  For weapons, procs are interesting since you can blow your
dex way up with buffs, if you have interesting proc items then dex gear
might help too, but not at the expense of HP.

Oh, and a mount.  Big help.
