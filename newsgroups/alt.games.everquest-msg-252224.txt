And yet EQ thrived :P. I would wager that during the PoP year and a
half and up until GoD there were more people on than at any time in
the previous expansions. There are easily more high-end players now,
than there ever were, even with the DX9 hiccup. When i first started
playing sept 2002, 2 guilds controlled the top end zone(VT), with a
lot of much smaller guilds getting Velious, Kunark, and Luclin scraps.
Just getting back on there are 6 guilds in Time, each being able to
field 50-60 people a night and not including the smaller guilds doing
the elemental/VT and tier 1-3/old world progression.

And in a lot of ways its superior. The game playability was shit..
just admit that. You may have slogged through the snow uphill naked in
those days... but while you may have masochisticly thought that meant
it was 'better', it really just meant the playability had yet to be
fixed.
