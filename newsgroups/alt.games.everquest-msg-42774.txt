I'm level 55 druid and never felt like I had 9 k or 15 k to spend on a

Actually 9 or 15 k prices them out of my price range, I think my
druid's sow is probably faster anyway. From what I gathered the 9 k
one is jboots speed but I doubt if the upper one is 55 level sow
speed. 

9k or 15 k is pretty steep for a gimick, I don't think as many people
will buy these as you think.

I actually hope people can't take these on planes raids.. it would be
so obnoxious.
