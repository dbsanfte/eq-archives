More about the druid.  She had a tendancy to spend a lot of mana healing 
me, then say OOM and expect me to wait.  When I'm really hurt, it makes 
sense for me to sit and regen some HP... but if she heals me up to full 
and then thinks I'm going to sit she's got another think coming.  In 
situations where this heal and sit thing makes sense, its still better 
to not heal me in this way;

Instead, heal a little, sit till FM, heal some more, repeat.  Why? 
Because if I'm actually sitting with you, then a) I'm regenerating hp. 
b) if I'm under 70% hp then I can bandage as well.  Say I'm at 30% hp, 
and you are going to spend enough mana to heal me 50%.  I can do that 
remaining 20% twice as fast if you take your time, let me bind wounds 
while we wait for part of that.  Then still leave me at 90% while you 
med back up to full, if I've been sitting a while my regen rate is going 
to be pretty high and I'll probably be full hp before you have the mana 
back from healing me 70% to 90%.

Mammoth hunting, though, isn't a "gotta have full hp" situation.  I'm 
soloing these things fairly steady, so the druid is only there to speed 
things up; this means I'm never going to sit and wait on her mana.  She 
has to look at things in terms of how they will most speed things up; 
heals to stop me having to sit so often or for so long, buffs to make 
kills faster and so save even more sitting time, playing second scout to 
find the next mob faster, doing damage on her own, again taking some of 
the pressure off me.

SOW, DS, Strength, Regen, skin would probably be the most usefull buffs, 
in descending order of importance.
