Indeed, I have no problem with the reduction of clicks, no problem with
in-game recipe lists, no problem with clicking the recipe and getting the
item back.

But will it remove the excitement I felt finding books on a vendor with the
new patch and reading them, in-game, to see what recipes they might
contain, and then tracking down the stuff, playing with slight variations
because they're never exact, and getting something new at the end of it.

If, when a new expansion is released, everyone's recipe book contains
everything, and the only rush is to find where the stuff is dropped, a
little bit of the fun will have gone for me.

Not because it's easier, but because the discovery has gone.
