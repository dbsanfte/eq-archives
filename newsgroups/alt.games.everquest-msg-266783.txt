They fixed this so that it's actually correct now: $0.99 each or all 4 for 
$2.99.

I think it's going to affect sites like Allakhazam's premium service. I 
signed up for SOE's and did not renew Alla, just because this is likely to 
be *the* definitive source and it's automated, no need to rely on anyone 
reporting and verifying info. I am listed in my guild as the first person to 
"find" an item and I never reported anything.
