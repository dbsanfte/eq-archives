To be honest, take the windfall and buy your next couple ranks of
spells.  They'll serve you better than a full set of Carmine at this

That being said, if you really want some items, you can probably pick
up a Robe of the Keeper for that much... Or a combination of Black
Iron Medallion, Savant's Cap, and Crysknife.
