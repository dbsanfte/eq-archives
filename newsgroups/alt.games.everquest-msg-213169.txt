Call me cynical - but I put this is the category of 'clutching at
straws'

Sure - the mother will try and claim she was addicted and it was the
evil game which 'lead her astray' - in her situation, wouldn't you?

I put it in the same camp as the mass murderers who claim it was all
because they were not breast feed when they were a baby - causing them
to be emotionally crippled for life!! Yeah - sure - gets my vote!!! ;(

There you go - hows that for contentious? and I promise I will not
respond to a single reply on this - positive or negative. Just to show
my mind is not closed on this - I promise will read all replys and
believe me - I am receptive to ideas - always happy to learn.

Cheers.
