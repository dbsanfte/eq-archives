I have a levitate that lasts a very long time (O'Keil's Levity), and I've
got a permanent Enduring Breath item, so I'm pretty safe. :-)

For people without a long lasting levitate, then they have to remember to
come back before levitate wears off and recast it if they aren't on the
boat.  Levitate spells do not have random duration like, say, invisibility,
so that would work.
