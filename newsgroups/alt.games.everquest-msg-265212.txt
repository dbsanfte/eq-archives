Yes. The people who made Everquest the best online gaming experience
ever, are gone from Everquest. Developers and players both.

And this is a good thing?

There aren't going to be level 50 accounts with uber gear for newbs to
buy in EQ2, you know. People are going to have to start from scratch,
they aren't going to be junping into a pre-fab character into a fully
populated and mature game world.

EQ2 will be what players make of it. If EQ2 is played by the same
dullards and dickheads who are playing on, say, Rodcet Nife as we
speak... well, that's not going to be any more of a game than
Everquest is right now. In fact, it will be less. The third and fourth
generation dweebs playing EQ now had giant sized shoulders to stand
on... people with brains, talent andf leadership who figured out how
to get things done and how things worked.

That didn't prevent the game from becoming a zerg-rush-rules-all piece
of shit. But, it didn't start that way. I'm guessing EQ2 *will* start
that way. Because they aren't using original EQ as a template, they
are using current EQ as a template. And current EQ is not a good game.

No... I want 300% resists, because boss mobs use spells that divide my
resist by 3... so even against those spells, I will have 100% resist
and be immune. I want 12000 hitpoints even though my base hitpoints
are only 2200. I want 8000 mana even though my base mana is only 1300.
Oh, and I want mana regen so fast that I never have to rest and regain
mana... say, 60 mana per tick standing, whereas my base mana regen is
0 per tick standing.

Yeah. That'd be cool. And, not only would it be cool, but if I don't
have these things I can't get in a guild, because my character is a
gimp.

Uber is not a state of mind. I *might* have gone along with that the
first year EQ was out, when even the best magic equipment only
provided a marginal increase in capability. Equipment became the
beginning and the end of the story several years ago, though. EVen the
insane buffing spells don't mean a thing, because you can find people
to cast those spells on you anywhere, any time, but without the
equipment you are still useless, because everybody expects you to have
the equipment AND the spells.

Fighting used to be fun in Everquest. It was hard. For at least the
last 2 years, though, it's just been a case of writing the correct
macros and hitting the correct hotkeys at the correct time. I'm pretty
sure I could write a script to play an EQ character better than the
average humna EQ player does. In fact, I'm sure I could. Scripts don't
hit the wrong hotkey. Scripts don't go afk for coffee without telling
anybody. Scripts don't get involved in tell hell and forget to hit
their hotkeys at the correct time.

And really, which of us wants to pay $20 a month in order to be a
human macro-execution script? The game doesn't require people to
think, anymore. The game doesn't require skill, anymore. The game
doesn't require creative problem solving, anymore. None of the things
that I LOVED about EQ is required, anymore. That's why I don't require
EQ, anymore.

>Part of the problem SWG has with keeping people

The *entire* problem with SWG is that it's boring.

And I don't really want to discuss SWG, Ultima Online, DAoC or any
other online game. Original Everquest is the benchmark. Anything that
doesn't compare well to original Everquest, is unworthy.
