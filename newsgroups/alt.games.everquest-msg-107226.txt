You are about the only one then.  Conventional wisdom, the majority of the 
playerbase, and even Verant themselves have stated that druids are very 
good soloers.  A single dissenting voice doesn't carry much weight.

Wah wah wah.  Good druids group or solo as they prefer.  Whiny druids 
don't get groups because most people prefer to not group with annoying 
characters.  No class, with the possible exception of necros, can solo 
nearly so well as a druid from 1 to 60.  None.  Not even twinked.
