So what if the 2200 had a few kpp spare and bought up the lowest offers
?
or if the 2200 is a second account / friend of some one selling one for
1000 ?

There are all sorts of fun trade "scams" that could now opperate.

I wonder what the best item to do this kind of thing would be ?

Probably a dropable component for a high end quest that is in low
supply.
Something that sells for a couple of kpp.

Mind you you would need a bit of capital <G>


The other option is to have 2 accounts one selling and one buying.
Buyer buys up "lowball" and "clear out" items cheep
Seller is constantly logged on selling at "reasonable" prices.
Items eventually sell, you make pp.

If you ran it like a business you could mark down prices on slow selling
items etc. and manage you stock effectivly.

Also from other comments you buyer could probably pick up items at less
than sell to NPC prices for extra income.

Working this for a few weeks could equip a whole set of alts.
Running this kind of opperation from a guild would be a good way to make
funds.
?Annother way to get DKP, give 10kpp to guild funds?
