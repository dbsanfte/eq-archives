Yep, did the curskin quest about 20 times, the money isnt that bad, but its
hard to find a living pup, and they're green now (fall under category of
slaughtering level 1-2s), plus, if I buy the skins from a vendor, I lose
money from the bargain .  Bone chip quest exp is thinning out, and vendors
pay more for 4 chips than that cheapskate trooper.  Patchwork is alright,
but for the most part my armor is on par or better (nice high level bought
me rhinohide tunic and pants).  Watcher torcher are ok, except for the fact
that a) they don't stack, b) Warsliks is a VERY crappy newbie zone c)LoIO is
2 zones away, its a bit time consuming (although I can buy torches at
vendors in LoIO and make money still, rather than hunting greenies).
Scorpion pincers quest gives less cash than just selling them, and minimal
exp at my level, and still falls under the "slaughter greenies" category.

Killing things for gold is what I have been doing, but I mainly do it for
exp (and exp would be a lot easier to get if I could afford my level 9 DoT,
hehe)

I basically was looking for a "quick fix" like an HQ bear pelt is to an old
world level 5's money woes, or the GLS quest, which sets up level 8-12s in
the old world with a respectable fortune (for their level)
