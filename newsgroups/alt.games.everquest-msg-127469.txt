Just in case you didn't know (and there are a tremendous number of users of
Windows who know nothing about key combinations) and as no one here has
explained.... ALT+TAB is the standard application switch in Windows so, in
theory, when you hit that key combination it was taking you to an alternate
application running under Windows. Again, if you weren't aware, if you were
in any other "good" Windows application then a box would appear centre
screen with the icons for the currently running applications and, if you
continue to hold the ALT key down and hit the Tab key it will cycle through
those applications until you release the ALT key. An alternate method of
switching applications to selecting it from the taskbar with the mouse.
