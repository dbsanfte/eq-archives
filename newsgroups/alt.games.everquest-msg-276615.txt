First off you're mischaracterizing my comments, even the bit you
quoted makes that plain if you bother to actually read the entire
sentence.

Second, you're wrong regardless.  In the end, it always comes
down to an either or.  For a group that is already formed and is
considering a tough pull, a particular named, or even just where to
hunt, the question comes down to "Do you think we can take 'em?  or
should we just leave?" (to quote an old friend speaking long before
EQ existed).  A group considering prospective tanks will ask the
question "Can we expect him to [reliably] tank the mobs we want to
fight?", except that "reliably" is implicit rather than explicit,
which apparently causes you severe distress.

A tank will simply say whether he can tank such-and-so, _maybe_
qualifying his statement with the requirement of a Cleric healer
and/or a slower if the mob's damage output is high enough that
success is unlikely otherwise.

The point of this particular statement of the obvious is what?  You
expect video game players to spend hours analyzing probabilities
everytime they put a group together, and again when they actually
choose a target?  If not, then what's the point?  Any EQ player
with two spare braincells to rub together is aware of this, and
the remainder don't have the vocabulary to read what you wrote.

Thank you captain obvious.  Did you bother to actually read even
the single sentence of mine you quoted above?

ROFL, name one. Go on, describe the raid composition and tactics
where you could expect a knight to gain aggro on MT death BEFORE
all the healers and other squishies are dead.  You do realize
that only Warriors get the guaranteed success AE Taunt ability,
and that the Taunt skill is almost indistinguishable from /say
for gaining aggro on yellow/red con mobs, right?

No, NOT tankability.  Tanking is NOT about surviving for a few
seconds.  A Ranger can mitigate 100% of incoming melee damage
for 18 seconds, FAR more damage than these discs can mitigate,
yet that has very little impact on a Ranger's effectiveness as
a tank.  You don't choose a tank to stand for a few seconds once
in a while, that's not what we do.  Furious is not the disc that
makes Warriors overwhelmingly superior tanks on the hardest
hitting mobs in the game.

There are only two tanking discs in EQ, Defensive and its cousin
Stonewall, and both are the exclusive property of Warriors.
They are remarkable, distinct, and overwhelmingly superior for
exactly one reason:  they last for 3 minutes.  That duration is
why a Warrior can tank mobs under disc that he has no realistic
chance to tank undisced.  No other defensive (small 'd') disc in
the game has anywhere near that duration.  These knight discs
not only have 1/6 the duration, they also have a damage cap that
assures they will wear off prior to their stated duration if you
attempt to use them to tank any mob with truly challenging melee
damage output.

Can't have that now, can we?  Why then the players might actually
try to hold them to their word.  Not that it'd matter anyway.  To
give just one example, it's been literally years since they
promised to make the Paladin spell Thunder of Karana useful (it
was originally so stupidly overpowered that it's incredible it
ever saw the light of day), it remains a useless piece of crap
not worth the time to scribe in your spellbook to this day.

That is not their stated intent.  You really do need to work on
that reading comprehension.
