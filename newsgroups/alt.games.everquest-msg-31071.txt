Had the following conversation with a nitwit on Prexus today.
Normally, I don't tell another player when I petition their dumb name,
but I was feeling a bit petulant today, and was also curious to see
how such a conversation might go. I have to say, it wasn't a big
surprise.

[edited for clarity only - no content changed or excluded]

You told wantsomedrinks,  'I've petitioned your name. It's a violation
                          of the naming rules.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'it is?'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'oh yes, and then some.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'who are you?'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'the person who petitioned your name.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'why?'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'because it violates the naming rules.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'why would u do that?'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'so?'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'if you have to ask, then you'll never
                          understand the answer. Just don't be
                          surprised if a GM changes it for you soon.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'why would u want to point me out simply
                          because of my name'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'you point yourself out with your name.
                          I had nothing to do with that.'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'meanwhile, you might check the 
                          www.everquest.com web site for the rules
                          of the game.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'I talked to the GM Zrinic about this name
                          yesterday and when I told him the meaning
                          behind it he said it was okay'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'so ure taddling on me beacause u don't like
                           my name?'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'that's very childish'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'Tattling, not taddling.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'I don't care how it's spelled'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'no, childish is deciding that you don't
                          have to follow the same rules as everyone
                          else.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'I can petiton your name for meaning
                          something in Sandscript that i don't like
                          would u appreciate that'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'so I have no rights to be creative just
                          because u or ure friends got ure name turned
                          down? that's trivial'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'by all means, if you find my name to be
                          against the rules, petition it. Knock
                          yourself out.'

[I should have pointed out to him that it was unlikely he knew of any
meaning of my name in Sandscript, since he wasn't fluent enough in it
to know that it's actually spelled Sanskrit]

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'no that is very childish. i didn't get a
                          cooky so he can't either?'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'cookie*'

[He caught that one all by himself. I was so *proud* of him!]

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'that is very immature.'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'I never had a name turned down, because,
                          you see, MY idea of creative involves
                          actually coming up with a name that doesn't
                          violate the rules.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'why do you care?'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'ure acting like a child. '

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'as I already stated, if you have to ask,
                          you wouldn't understand.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'i am psychoanalist. try me'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'Call me a child if you want, but in the
                          end, it is you, not I, who broke the game
                          rules. I was polite enough to tell you that
                          I had done so, as a courtesy.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'who cares about the rules please?'

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'wow, a shrink who can't spell Tattle. How
                          amusing.'

[Heck, he can't spell "psychoanalyst", for that matter]

You told Wantsomedrinks,  'You don't have to care about the rules, you
                          just have to follow them, like the rest of
                          us. Good bye.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'ure a kid who petitioned someone because
                          there name didn't meet game specifications'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'LOL'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'ure such a 10 year old.'

Wantsomedrinks tells you, 'ure very dumb.'
