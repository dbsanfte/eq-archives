Thanks, Sean. And yes, we do return, don't we? I admit it, I'm a
self-confessed MMOG junkie. I love the experience and thoroughly enjoy
exploring new systems that provide innovative dynamics for social
interaction, for me this is the essence of the experience. Some people say
that these are "just games" but I don't think this is true: these are
communities and this is (for me anyway) their primary appeal.

Although I've had many headbutts with some of the mechanics of EverQuest, I
can say without a moment's hesitation that no world is more rich and
rewarding in terms of this all-important community layer. Some people call
it "content", but I see it as a huge variety of opportunties for the kind of
experience I had getting my boots. As great as the crafting system is in
Star Wars Galaxies (I've seen none better), in 7 months of intense play
there I never once felt the kind of thrill I had killing the Dire Wolf.

This is the subject of a whole different thread for another occasion, but
it's interesting to note that one of the things that people (including
myself) have complained about in EverQuest actually turns out to be one of
its most powerful strengths. And that's the whole class interdependence
thing. In many of the newer game systems (e.g., SWG, FFXI) you can mix and
match abilities almost infinitely across the character spectrum. Proponents
of that model argue that EverQuest "imposes grouping" and "forces class
interdependence" and I've even been on the side of those making the
accusation. But you know what? It's true, and it turns out to be briliant
design. In EverQuest everyone has a role to play (oooo, another way to think
about those two words!) and when they play it well, it's a beautiful thing.
In a world where anyone can be anything, eventually the uber template
emerges and the world becomes homogenized around some variant of the classic
tank/mage or tank/healer. I've seen it over and over again. In EverQuest you
make a commitment to a certain class and with that commitment comes a very
specific set of expectations of the various things that you can contribute
to a group. And while this can slow down the grouping effort (LFG = PITA),
the result is often a wonderful experience where all parts are moving in
unison like a well-oiled machine.

Translation: I missed EQ and I'm glad to be back (again). Thanks for the
welcome.

Aye, my wife has already commented on the "back at EverQuest" syndrome ...
