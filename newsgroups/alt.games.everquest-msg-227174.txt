If you sit at the zone in an active hunting ground expect to get trained,
thats it. I agree its polite to warn them and stop if possible to do so but
if you're going to get killed if you do then just run by. They're close to
the zone they can run away just as easy.

I am close friends with a few SK's IRL and all I can say is I feel your
pain.
