Hello there.
 
In an effort to stave off the unsavory netizens from my system, I
recently purchased Norton Internet Secuity, but having trouble getting
EQ and this program to cooperate.
 
Even if I disable the softwar,I was having difficulties connecting to
Everquest. As soon as the screen was done loading to the character
select screen, my system would crash to the desktop.
 
It is one thing to have this happen when the software is active, but
it was another thing to have this occur when disabled. After
uninstalling the product, I managed to connect without any issues. 
 
Anyone have any ideas regarding this matter?
