In the time it would take you to die and respawn repeatedly as you
slowly beat down a red con mob you could get substantially more exp
killing multiple blue mobs between deaths.  Verant long ago capped exp
awards for mobs in an attempt to reduce "power levelling", and perhaps
also to discourage the practice of kiting red con mobs which resulted
in quite a few "innocent bystander" deaths (I recall a number of whiny
posts about red con exp being "nerfed" around the time it was done).

But, yes, with the new rules, under L10 you can easily use death to
speed your exp gain.  Simply fight near your spawn point, killing xp
giving mobs as fast as you can with no particular regard for your toon's
safety, when you respawn with all your gear charge back in and keep
killing.  This works especially well in newbie zones like GFay where
melees can be bound near to where L4 to L9 mobs spawn.  Between this
and the increased xp awards under L10 Verant has, in effect, set up
the game to PL everybody under L10.

You do not regain full mana after being killed by another player.  This
eliminated a PvP exploit used by casters (die in PvP combat, respawn and
mem a nuke, return to the fray naked and nuke 'til you die, etc.) on the
Zek servers.
