And again, anyone could bugger the system simply by creating a bunch of
temporary characters, one after another, to either drive your rating through
the roof or through the floor.

Now, if you could only add your rating once per *account*, then it might be
possible.  Note, you'd be adding your opinion once per *your account* for
each of *his* characters.  Thus, you could give a single positive or
negative "review" of each of his characters, one time only per 5 of *his*
levels going up, and one time only per single level going down, as per your
description.  The difference being that it's *you* (i.e., your account)
"reviewing" his *character*.
