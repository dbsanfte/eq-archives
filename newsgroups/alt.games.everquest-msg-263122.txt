Strangely enough, people can discuss design decisions about a game
regardless of whether they qualify as "problems" or not.  =P

I run the +hp tribute all the time.  It's 21 points every 10 minutes to do
so.  There are other useful things I could turn on, such as +atk and that
tribute version of death pact, but I don't, because I don't feel like going
and pillaging "newbie" zones to feed my habit, nor buying stuff out of the
bazaar for the sole purpose of tribute.

So, you can think that fewer droppable items would be tributed, but I am
thinking that more tribute abilities would get used instead.

Guild tribute, while it is technically the "same mechanic" as personal
tribute, gets outrageous fast when an entire raid has it turned on.  Play
with it a bit, see how you can easily make it cost 5k tribute points per ten
minutes.  With just +hp (again, being efficient like the way I use personal
tribute), and every "tank" having it turned on, it climbs toward 1k per 10
minutes quickly.  Chances are, on fights where we would actually want this
minor benefit, *everybody* would want the extra hitpoints.  Back up to 5k
and climbing.

So, surprise, my guild doesn't use guild tribute.  Simply not worth it.

And if my guild could collect all the no-drop stuff that rots and turn it in
for guild tribute, it might actually make it worthwhile to use.
