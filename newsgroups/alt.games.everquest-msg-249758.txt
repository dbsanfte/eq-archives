    You're free to disagree, of course.  I do know that in the past people
have defended the books, though I don't know if is it as many as have
trashed them.  Part of the problem with saying "Most people" and "this
newsgroup" is that only a small fraction of EQ players post here.  I don't
know how many active posters age has right now.  I sorted by sender, and
counted names till I got about halfway through the list, and got 74 names. 
So, if we double that we get about 150.  It's been about a month since I
have cleared the groups, I think.  So lets be  generous and say that right
now we have 250 active posters to age. I don't believe that this is enough
to extrapolate in a meaningful way as to whether or not "most people" in EQ
feel a certain way about something.  Really, the only way to find out how
most people feel would be to do a log on poll on SOE's end.  Since there is
no indication that they have any thoughts of removing the books, there
really would be no point to them doing that.

    That said, there are people who have spoken up in other threads, myself
being one.  Others have as well.  This subject keeps being brought up.  It
gets tiring to say "I don't think the books are that bad" over and over
again, especially when you know that you are not going to be changing the
minds of the people who are dead set against them.
