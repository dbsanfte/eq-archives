Wasn't meaning to imply that you were accusing him of making it up.  I
was just making sure that anyone reading my post understood how I saw
the word being used, is all.  I really need to tighten up my writing
skills, I still end up giving people impressions I don't want them to
have.

And for my area, and all the groups I've been in, it IS all that
common.  Yes, in the RPG community, but I figured a lot of the folks
here might have at least some familiarity with that subset of the
human race.  Probably just because I, like everyone else, tend to see
people as being like me, through my filters, as it were.  Since I've
been heavily part of the tabletop RPG community for the last 2 decades
and more, I tend to see everyone through that particular filter.  And
forget that a lot of the EQ community come solely from the computer
game scene.

Finally, to the insensitivity issue.  I tend to get tired of everyone
being offended by this, and upset by that.  I'm generally a polite
person, and I do try to offend as few people as possible, but I also
think that too many people go around looking for things with which to
be offended.  A lot of people overreact, and that's what I see this
as, an overreaction.  That's just my point of view, take as you will.
