Im obviously failing to see something here . Could you try to explain how
you got from the lack of tcc causes you to spend time camping?

Verants position is that equipment should be valuable . The present method
of making items valuable is to make the critter that drops it rare ,the drop
off of the critter rare, or the travel involved in getting there long.

Tcc will make equipment rarer too . It will make it so that of the set of
people who could normally get the item only a subset can actually get it .
Either you will be a member of the subset that can get the item or you wont
be . Either way the amount of time spent camping that item will in no way be
changed .

It sounds like you not only want your small protected minority availability,
but that you also want verant to eliminate the time items normally require .
This would just increase the problems caused by tcc. You do realize that you
are only going to be that small protected minority for a very small portion
of your characters life dont you? Pretty much the road goes up , it dont
come down again.
