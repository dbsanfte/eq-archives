I installed  Luclin on my Pii-333 with 256mb ram and Geforce2 mx400 card.  I
have all new models except kitty, dwarf, and ogre turned off and screen set to
640x480  First use of inventory screen, spell screen, switch from one bank of
hot keys to another, etc, all take about 3-6 seconds.  Otherwise, it's very
playable, just not as pretty as my 1.4ghz P4 with 512mb ram.
