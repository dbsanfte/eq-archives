I enjoyed the easy money at AG's. But the guy was spamming OOC whining
about it and being generally rude and obnoxious. If he didn't expect
the ability to make 2k or more pp per week killing mobs that were
below level 10, he was an idiot. There is also the fact that, as I
mentioned, high level players scumming the AG's was making it near
impossible for dwarf newbies to do some of their armor quests. You're
somehow surprised that I could find something negative to say about
that?
