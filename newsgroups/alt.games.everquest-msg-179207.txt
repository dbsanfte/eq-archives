Hmmm... seems like a good solution would be to have Tailors make a
Deluxe Sewing kit...  maybe make em have a little weight reduction
and/or be made from some rarer (not super rare mind ya) droped items.

could be sorta a quest for the tailor to improve thier skill....
perchance make them trivial above 150?

Good hunting to ya.
