careful, the mighty bizbee will deem you a troll too for questioning his
authority.  he might even put you on ignore !! *gasp*


I've observed that all bizbee does is berate people, ive never actually seen
him help anybody, but alas, this is apparently his only window into the
world cuz he replies to damn near every original post at least once.


darktyger berates people too but at least he helps when folks ask a
question..


And yes. this is pretty much all I do here. attack bizbee and dt, they are
famous and therefor must be attacked..  the trolls need a leader and damnit,
im not scared of you wussy elves :/
