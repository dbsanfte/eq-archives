Your claim to authority was to Amnesty International.  Not
Noam Chomsky.  You did not originally attribute your 
claim to Chomsky because, of course, his credibility is at best
questionable.  Instead, you pretended that AI was your
source in an appeal to authority because people who
know Chomsky are more likely to believe AI.  My point
was never about what Noam Chomsky claimed.  Like most
of the rest of the world, I recognize Noam Chomsky as
a crackpot.  I don't care.

My point was and is that your misrepresentation with
respect to AI was evidence of a classic appeal to
authority.
  
You seem simply incapable of the most trivial bit of 
honesty in terms of attribution.
