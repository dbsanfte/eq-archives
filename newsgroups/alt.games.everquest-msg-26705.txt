I have killed this guy a few times with my 40 Druid, he is fast and hits
damn hard. I have used snare but not tried root, snare worked okay but
you have to be quick on your feet. Best tactic is to get him, outside
and play ping pong with him between two casters, that works a treat with
minimal damage. Btw I was PL ing my Shammy, thats why I was there.
Best thing I saw was when he died and his head fell off, Lol.
