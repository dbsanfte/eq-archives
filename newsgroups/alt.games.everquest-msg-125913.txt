As a ranger, after having spent HOURS getting this skill up, I
regretably find that its pretty much a wasted ability.  I was very
much into figuring out which of the two was most efficient, as
downtime for healing can be quite horrendous as a ranger.  Alas, it is
far more efficient to sit and med, then heal, rather than waste the
time binding wound (this is ofcourse if you are able; i.e. you're not
oom and have a nasty dot on you while you're really low on health).

Let me explain.

Bind wound takes 10 seconds to do its thing.  You can't be sitting
while you do this, so your mana regens at the standard non-medding
rate (it essentially doesn't).  With a skill of 200 (which you can't
get till you're lvl 50, btw, at least for rangers), you get 50 hp's
every 10 seconds, plus a second or two for lag/reflexes.  But lets say
its 50 hp every 10 seconds.  So in 20 seconds you can heal 100 points
of health.  But 20 seconds of medding gives you back quite a bit more
mana than what you use for our 90 hp heal spell.  So over time, it is
less efficient to not med and bandage wound, than to just med and cast
healing as mana permits.  No doubt, as I get the more efficient heals,
this will only magnify the inefficiency of bandaging wounds over
healing.  And it is nowhere close to being efficient for those classes
that are true "healers" (priests, paladins).
