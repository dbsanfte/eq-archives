At 14 the exp off the belts isn't worth the space they eat, instead sell them
to people who are leveling up twinks or trying to get faction, you will
find they fetch 1 to 3pp each depending on server and time of day.
Belts are good exp up to 10 or so, when switching over to pads becomes
sensible as you won't be able to pack enough belts into your backpacks
to make the run to Kaladim produce more exp than staying and killing
more mobs in the same time span.
