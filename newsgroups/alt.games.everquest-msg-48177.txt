Can I put this in my folder of future .sigs? This one's just too good to pass
up.

And pertaining to chefery (no..that's not a word. I make up words when I see
fit), chefs are the hardest working people I've seen. A friend of mine had made
it to Sous  Chef by the age of 19 (the boy was a freaking cooking prodigy..I
made him cook for me a lot ^_^) When he quit when he was 20, he worked at a
bagel shop and a starbucks full time. He slept in between jobs. And never once
did he complain, and became the manager of the bagel shop with ease. 
So never, ever dis a chef. They're as tough as they come.
