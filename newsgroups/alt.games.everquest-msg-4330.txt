BWAHAHAHAHAHA I'm telling you, Jazz, you should have kept it up! Like
you said, anyone who's played more than 20 minutes would know it's
bullshit. I think it would have been funny to see just how far this
rumor spread...Hell, just going into freeport and seeing tons of bodies
everywhere would have been fun in and of itself! I must say, though,
that I am truly surprised this made it all the way over to this NG.
