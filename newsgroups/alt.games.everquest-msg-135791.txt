Ok, posted this on my guilds board, might as well post it here too, 
before the forum are overrun with bazaar questions (on my server, around 
1-2 people a min wanna know how to use bazaar):


Heres the Bazaar for Dummies guide

Before entering bazaar:
Turn clip pane ALL the way down. Dont need anything else, but remove 
that clip pane if you wanna move around. I hardly get any lag after clip 
pane are down, less lag than the zone had with clip pane on before the 
Bazaar went live.

To buy stuff:
There are 2 ways to buy stuff. Can run around like a madman and clicking 
on the 250+ traders to see inventory.
OR you can use the smart way:
Type /bazaar
Now you can search for items by name, or by slot, class, race, and so 
on. Can combine searches so can find all earrings an ikky monk can use.
To buy it, use /bazaar to find the item you want. Rightclick on sellers 
name, and youll be turned towards the seller (like when using locate 
corpse). Follow your nose, and remember that if you point into a wall, 
the odds are that the guy is on the other side, so run around it. 
Right-click on seller in question, and buy like from a normal vendor.
If they guy dont have the item, its a bug, items can show up for hours 
after they have been sold, verified it with several items i were trying 
to buy. Hope VI fix it soon.
A vendor can only display 30 items at a time, so if his stock are 
filled, and you dont see the item you were looking for, it MIGTH still 
be there, i managed to buy 2 spells after asking people in vendor mode 
if they still had the spells (dont expect answer though, most vendors 
are AFK)

To buy spells, it get REAL easy, this feature are the heaven for spell 
buyers. Start Bazaar, type Spell in the name field. Select your class in 
the class field, and press find. Presto, all druid spells for sale 
listed alphabetically.

To sell stuff:
Selling stuff are easy too.
First you need a bag. Go to the vendor area, and buy a Traders Satchel 
from the vendor that sell them. Put all the stuff you wanna sell in the bag.
Go to the trader areas (along all the wood walls, look where the other 
250+ people are standing). Type /trader, and there will come a window 
where you put prices on your items. Be SURE you typed the right price, 
heard rumors of a CoF for 9K due to someone messing up. Press start 
trading to start trading. Do not move outside vendor area, trading will 
stop then.
Do NOT, repeat NOT, all gang up near the 2 banks. In bazaar, you dont 
get overburdened, so distance from banks dont matter, but when 25 people 
are tryign to be at the same spot, its quite hard for your customers to 
find you, even with the locate function (I personally looked at 6 
vendors goods before i found the one i needed, halfway hidden inside a 
guy in bear form). You WONT get any more customers by being near bank, 
but youll loose customers by them not being able to find you, so USE the 
space there are in bazaar. Can have 50 people standing on the corner 
near a bank, and a total of 5 people on a whole trader area near Arena. 
Use that space.

You can NOT trade in vendor mode, so if youre selling something 
normally, or trying to buy something, you have to close vendor windows 
first.


Before leaving Bazaar:
REMEMBER to put all your money back in the bank, i just take all my 
money when i go shopping there, so i dont have to run to bank. But when 
porting out without SoE it get quite nasty at the other end if you got 
enough money. I made the mistake myself, and suddently there were a big 
Hesten-shaped hole in the hills of Misty Thicket.
