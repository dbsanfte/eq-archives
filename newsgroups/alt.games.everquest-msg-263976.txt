Actually, I ran into an interesting case a few nights ago.
We had a party of 3, and the leader tagged me with Designate
Main Assist or whatever it is that made my targets get the
special ring, and also the one that puts the target's health
over its head.  (For all I know those are the same ability?)
Later, the third player left so we were down to two again,
and I noticed that the special leadership effects were still
there.

So though you might need to be in a group of 3+ to activate
a leadership ability, and to gain leadership experience in
the first place, it seems that dropping back down to 2 does
not turn the effects off.
