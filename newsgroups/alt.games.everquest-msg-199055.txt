do yourself a favor and go somewhere with animals.  Panic/Terrorize 
animal and Charm Animal are awesome spells that you should be using.  I 
spent quite a while in IC killing cougars with Panic and Charm.  You can 
also solo Zelniaks in DSP very well the same way.
  It's also fun to go to NK and charm a griffawn and have it kill the 
momma griffennes.  Usually have to run for guards for griffons and don't 
even try the silver griffin you won't last long.
