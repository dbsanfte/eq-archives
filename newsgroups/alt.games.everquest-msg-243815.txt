As tempted as I am to argue with your characterization that Shamans have
become obsolete, I really have to agree that the new content is going in
that direction. It's just astonishing how blind SOE is to this reality, too.
Brenlo recently posted that "Shaman have recently been significantly
enhanced", suggesting that we are probably done for a while. What's
"significant"? Well, our main fast heal went from 1300hp for 450 mana to
1550hp at 490 mana. This, for an expansion where mobs regularly double,
triple and quad for 1200-2200. Probably the best new spell we received is a
Slow that can be found in the high end of GoD (Tiers 2 and higher) that is
1.5 seconds cast time (woot!) and includes a -40 MR (awesome), but only
lasts 90 seconds (hmm, ok, fast encounters in GoD) with an effective rate of
60% (eh??). First time I mentioned that I had this spell, I had a Beastlord
say "Ah, so they've finally made you as good as us".

The screwy thing about the SOE vision for SHM is that it seems to be based
on the notion that we are the Kings of Slow. Nevermind the negligible
difference between a SHM 75% and a ENC 70%, or BRD or BST fast slows in a
world of quick encounters, or the fact that with Slow mitigation as one of
the principal new encounter tuning implements, slowing has been rendered
largely useless in the upper tiers of the new content. As long as we are
Kings of Slow, we are going to forgo other enhancements. Also, we are by
design pegged eternally at 47% healing efficiency relative to CLR, so we
really will never compete with them or DRU for healing, and this in a world
where the new content DEMANDS efficient healing.

And now they are finding on TEST that the new shielding spells do NOT stack
with Focus. Oh boy, won't that be fun after MGBs? Hoping that doesn't make
it to live, but it's kind of hard to guess SOE's intentions here.

I'd like to understand what SOE's vision is for the SHM in the new world so
that I can try and adjust expectations and goals accordingly. What's our big
contribution in the new content? It's not buffing (most of my peers and
guildmates have all of their stats maxed, Focus is the only routine buff.
It's not healing, it's not Slowing, and it's not DPS. So ... what is it,
SOE?
