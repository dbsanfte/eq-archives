Of course not.  And that's not what I'm arguing.

My point (and you've kind of missed it) is that if you're porting 'for
donations' without specifying a minimum amount, you have only yourself to
blame when you get less than you expect.

If you expect more than a certain amount, don't port 'for donations'.
Chances are you'll be disappointed.  Taking it out on your passenger because
she's not a mind reader is stupid.  Period.
