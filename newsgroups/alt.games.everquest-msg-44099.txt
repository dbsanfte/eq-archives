[Much excellent advice]

This sounds like just the thing, altho' that 500 point, 4 buffs
breath attack sounds scary!

Between this and BW, I should have plenty of space to fear kite
my heart out. Much thankees.

Party on the beach! I'll bring the Elven wine!

One question though: Can you still quest for the SS/CS key, or
do you need to kill the NPC in SS for it? I'm a newb when it comes
to this area, just got my WL tooth and stuff.

Ooh, one more question: Do quest gems drop there? I have no idea
where those drop...
