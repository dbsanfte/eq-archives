You need to get you're facts straight.  The 49 summons results
in a pet with a level range of 37-41.  Vocerate has a range of
41-45, Greater Vocerate has a range of 44-48 (45-49 with staff).
Epic is a guaranteed 49.

Consider this - pre-Kunark, a Greater Conjuration: Fire could 
*SOLO* a 50 warrior.

You don't play a 51 mage, do you?  I play a 52 mage, my pet can
still practically solo low blues.  (Elemental warriors in the
hole) with just the addition of a DS.  I've also seen good damage
against Mutant dregs (yellow at 51) and other yellow at 51 mobs.

Pets do decent damage to mobs as much as 7-8 levels above them.
A good Voc pet (44 or 45) does good damage against 50-53 mobs.

I have SEEN them do good damage to mobs that high.

Go to the magicians tower to see just how many whiners can 
congregate in one spot.

There are issues with pets.  Since they are our primary means
of sustained damage output, and their damage has not kept
pace with melee damage, we as a class fall behind.  This isn't
as dramatic as you imply at 51-54 ish.  In the high 50's it
becomes more dramatic.

You need to actually play at that level and make your own
observations, rather than blindly accept the opinion of
doom and gloomers at the Tower.
