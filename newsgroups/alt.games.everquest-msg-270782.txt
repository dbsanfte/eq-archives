I have a suggestion for you. Pony up for a server transfer and come to 
Stromm. All those toons would find groups there and you'd be having fun 
again. Personally, I think they ought to do server consolidations now if 
there are worlds like TP out there which lack the players for people to 
have fun at every level of the game. Or maybe you might want to 
investigate Morden Rasp, which as I'm sure you know is the newest 
server. There is probably a diverse range of toons there too at this point.

I started on Stromm a year ago and have a 65 Cleric and four low level 
alts (really low) so my guess is I am a newbie compared to you. But from 
what I see around my server, the world is alive and well with many 
characters from all levels running around. There are always people in 
the newbie zones playing from what I have seen, although some certainly 
are more popular than others, GFay comes to mind.

What is it like on FV by the way? How's the population there? What I 
mean is, how diverse is it in terms of level spread. I'd like to start a 
character there myself sometime for something different. I've never 
played on any other server besides Stromm.

If you want to check it out, roll a new toon on either Stromm or Morden 
Rasp and have a look around. I'm hoping you'll like what you see and 
consider a move so you can have fun again. I know it's expensive to move 
but to get back the game again that you enjoy playing it would be worth 
it. At least, I think so.
