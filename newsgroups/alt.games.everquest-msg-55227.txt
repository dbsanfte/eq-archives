Speaking as a cleric, I don't mind this, PROVIDED you do as Gary said
here, and take silence as a no. MANY, MANY times, I've had something
like the following happen:

A_Tank01 tells the party 'I have An_Uber_Mob02 on my tail, kill it!'
Soandso tells you 'Dood plz rez me in %FARAWAY ZONE%'
An_Enchanter00 begins to cast a spell.
(WOOP WOOP WOOP! AWOOOGA! CHANTER IS DEBUFFING!)
You begin casting Celestial Healing.
An_Uber_Mob02 hits A_Tank01 for 145 points of damage
An_Uber_Mob02 has become ENRAGED!
(DANGER WILL ROBINSON! TANK DYING FAST!!)
Soandso tells you 'PLLLLLZZZ!! I'll pay u 50pp!!! PLLZZZ!!!!'
You tell your group 'Complete Heal on <<< A_Tank01 >>>'
You begin casting Complete Heal.
An_Uber_Mob02 veel krush your party like bug!
A_Tank01 looks completely healed.
An_Uber_Mob02 says 'You will not evade me, Filina!'
You have been summoned!
You tell your group 'Going INVULNERABLE! Don't waste mana on me!'
You begin casting Divine Aura.
Soandso tells you 'PLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
An_Uber_Mob02 hits YOU for 153 points of damage!
An_Uber_Mob02 bashes YOU for 32 points of damage!
Your casting is interrupted.
An_Uber_Mob02 hits YOU for 155 points of damage!
An_Uber_Mob02 hits YOU for 148 points of damage!
You tell your group 'Going INVULNERABLE! Don't waste mana on me!'
You begin casting Divine Aura.
An_Uber_Mob02 tries to hit YOU, but misses.
The gods have rendered you invulnerable!
Soandso tells you 'WTF! If you don't come rezz me I'll tell the zone how
mean you are!'

Yes, children, clerics are sometimes too busy to even respond, let alone
actually help you...

Wow, that sounded harsh... Didn't mean for it to come out that way.
I'm just bitter because Lanys went down while we were prepping to kill
the Blood Reaver, i guess. Sigh...

PS: Here's a funny contest: Find all the factual errors in my made-up
transcript =)

PPS: My spell checker thinks that "Polish" is the correct spelling of
"PLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLZZZZZZZZZ"
