Dx9 will work will all graphics card out there, officially said if there is 
made a WHQL Certified driver for it.

Dx9 is a new set of graphics (audio, input devices etc. too) commands and 
instructions, which can be used for games.

If a graphics card does not have Dx9 support, it simply means that the GPU 
does not compute the commands and hands them over to your CPU.

However if your GPU understands them, it will do the work and show the 
stuff.

In shorter term, having a hardware compatible Dx9 graphics card equals 
freeing up some CPU power.

In your case I think your card is Dx7 supported and therefore your CPU is 
doing much of the graphics calculations for EQ being a Dx8.1 game.

Upgrading to a newer card with never Dx support, will free up your CPU and 
perhaps give you a smoother ride in EQ.

Did this help?!?!?
