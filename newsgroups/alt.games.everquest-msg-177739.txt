My PC nightmare continues... I've put together a new box in a rather 
piecemeal fashion, Athlon 2000+, GeForce4 Ti 4200, 1Gb RAM, a couple of 
HDs. My original problem was with it refusing entirely to boot; this was 
found to be caused by me having wired the IDE ribbons the wrong way 
around (don't ask. :).

Now, the computer boots (sometimes), but it locks up within seconds, 
sometimes before it has even had time to load windows, which pretty much 
rules out a software problem. The problem has gotten worse since I 
installed the video card; before it could stay up for hours, as long as 
I did nothing with it (such as play EQ, which would lock it up solid a 
few seconds after entering the world... emphasis on *after*. The 3D 
pipeline does indeed work). After installing the video card, it has gone 
down to minutes or seconds now, and getting worse.

It would seem to be a heat-related problem, but *seconds*? I should 
think that an overheating computer would start complaining after at 
least a few minutes of heavy work. The only thing I can think of is that 
I may have put insufficient transfer grease on the CPU, but before I 
uninstall the heatsink again, does anybody have other ideas I could try?

Thanks.
