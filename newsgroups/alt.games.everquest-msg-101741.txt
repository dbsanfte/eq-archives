I thought it was "kind of funny" the very first time I heard it when I got
my level 20 Bard mana song.  After that, I thought it was foolish.  A Cleric
in my guild, who is a very good cleric, constantly refers to me in group,
guild, and sometimes zone chat as her "crack-dealer".  That has gotten a
little more than tired.  It's only been, oh, 18 levels since she first
called me that.
Abbreviations?  I've been reading since I was very, very young (my parents
are teachers) and I still can't get over the amount of poor spelling, not
just in EQ, but American society itself.  Sure, there are a few odd-ball
rules in the English language, but if you are born and raised here it
shouldn't be that fucking difficult to spell or punctuate correctly.  Or at
least to try!  What is seen in EQ is merely a reflection of a sub-culture of
semi-literate slackers.  Unfortunately, I don't see this trend getting
anything but worse.
And to think Jesse Jackson wanted to make "Ebonics" an official language!
Could you imagine how ass-backwards literacy in America would be if we
actually ACCEPTED a language derived of slang and phonetically spells
garbage?
