As my crashes to desktop are very specific to the Plane of Tranquility, 
it occured to me that perhaps deleting all the PoT-related files and 
having the patcher download them could be of some help. Unfortunately, 
even though I tell the patcher to execute a throrough file check, it 
does not download those files... Is there a place where I can download 
them manually? I seem to remember a post along those lines some time ago...

Thanks.
