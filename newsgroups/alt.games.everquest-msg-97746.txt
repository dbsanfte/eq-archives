Because anyone who likes sitting and staring at the spellbook is an
idiot. Period.

I oughtta post that one to the forums. The idiotic things being said
suddenly would make most casual MMORPG fans start laughing their heads
off. "Could EQ players BE any stupider?"

Like staring at a spellbook, indeed. /rofl

Plonked for the idiot comment of "prove it" when the issue is staring
at a spellbook. It IS idiotic, and your "goodwill" means nothing to
me. Some people are too stupid to bother with.

I am going to make a sockpuppet and post an anti-Verant flame
elsewhere saying they screwed up by removing the spellbook, and see
how ripped to shreds I get.

Irrelevant, since losing experience is a much more cloudy issue than
sitting staring at a spellbook.
