My team regularly prefers a druid over a cleric.  Could be because we have
a sharp-as-nails shaman who is good at making everyone's job easy with Q
and good ghetto CC, but no...the only thing I miss not having in a cleric
is pacify (I'd say rez, except we almost never die...we're either
cautious, skilled, or cowards, I'm not sure which).  Pacify rocks my
world.  But so do druids.  (Nothing against clerics, druids are just more
self-sufficient, and with my friends, moving fast and each person watching
out for themselves is how we do so well....unless you have a
sharp-as-nails cleric who carries an invis item and isn't expecting to
being baby-footed around by others because "everyone watches out for the
cleric".  Honestly haven't yet met one cleric who didn't stand there
waiting to be invised.  I'm sure they exist, I just haven't met em.)

Druids who feel sorry for themselves need to be bitch-slapped. They have
an awesome class.  I'd still be playing it myself if I hadn't gotten
burned out on port-begs.   I honestly couldn't care less how well they
solo, but I *do* know that since our druid friend came back to the game
and became a regular part of our team, life has been SWEET!  

Oh, and a little parsing info for you...we found out last night that the
druid fire-based atk debuff (whatever it is called) reduces mob DPS more
than cripple.  Heck, I didn't even know they had that spell...why don't
more druids use that?

Whew, who got me fired up this morning?
