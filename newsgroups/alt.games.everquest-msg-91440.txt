Actually, for everyone in the guild the stuff you can quest for once
the sleeper is awakened seems better to me than just getting primal
does.

Essence Lens

"After the Sleeper has been awakened, prismatic scales drop off
remaining mobs in Sleepers Tomb. You then give your prismatic scale
and ST key to a dragon named Melalafen by hailing him and asking what
prismatic scale. After giving the key and scale you get an Essence
Lens. You can then trade for something different that best supplies
your class, resulting in the various Essence Items, which you can
cycle over and over till you get what you like"

Call me selfish, but as a wood elf druid I'd like to get:

"Essence Lens Submitted by: Zhua Zhing  
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  
AC: +15 Magic Resist: +15 Fire Resist: +15 Cold Resist: +15 Poison
Resist: +15 Disease Resist: +15 HP: +75 Mana: +75  
Weight: 0.0 
Classes: All Classes  
Races: All Races  
Inventory Slot: Ranged Weapon"
 
I'd swap it out for my Talisman of benevolance
for resist raid stuff. 
  
Primal still drops also, but only from a couple harder mobs I guess.

I'd also love this:


"Essence Ring   
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  
AC: +8 Magic Resist: +12 Fire Resist: +12 Cold Resist: +12 Poison
Resist: +12 Disease Resist: +12 HP: +65 Mana: +65  
Weight: 0.0 
Classes: All Classes  
Races: All Races  
Inventory Slot: Finger"

Beats the two 6 ac 65 hp rings I wear most of the time now, not really
finding any better druid rings yet (shadel ring would be about the
only other thing I'd get) 

Reading the posts I can't really tell if you can get these items
before the sleeper is awoken or not.

Gad the essence pearl earring is nuts too...
