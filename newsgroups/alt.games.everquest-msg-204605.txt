I killed a couple with my warrior/cleric duo while camping shards and
even using 2 click items I still found them way more trouble than they
were worth. Their dispell will take 4 buffs at once so rebuffing with
junk buffs for every fight was a pita, as my warrior's dps isn't that
great to begin with and shard farming is all about kill rate (and
patience, lots of patience).

I found moving just over from the druid portal was a good place to pull
everything but chromodracs, though sometimes a few wander by making
pulls a matter of longish detours to avoid them.
