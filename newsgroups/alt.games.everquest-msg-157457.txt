Does that make his point any less valid?

Wouldn't the fighters complain if you could hire any level fighter you
wanted for 2cp per game day?

How would the Enchanters feel if they started giving out high level mez and
clarity jewelry for free?

I'm glad they made the game easier for all the other players, but when they
start giving away for free the one service your character used to be able to
offer people, and give you NOTHING to take it's place, it IS a slap in the
face.
