So, I picked up EQ again after a haitus of a year, and I'm trying to
figure out what I want to play.  Anyone have comments?

Bard - Sounds great, except I have no interest whatsoever in
micromanaging the whacking order to keep multiple songs on at once.

Cleric - Looks good, but it's already played by everyone under the
sun.

Enchanter - What on earth is up with these?  Are you completely tied
to a group?

Paladin - Looks good except for the xp penalty.  Anyone have comments
on play style for this one?

Rogue - Maybe.  Is it possible to actually find groups at higher
levels?

Shadowknight - The idea is interesting, but apparently their xp
penalty just kills the fun, and no one will group with you.

Wizard - Seems kind of boring, and I've heard about difficulties in
getting a group.
