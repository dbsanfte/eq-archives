Sadly it isnt possible for a level 21 to do solo.  The quest is not a tough
one but you currently dont have the power to do it without external help.  I
had already played one wizard to level 52 when i quit EQ and cancelled my
account (Real life resitrictions) When i started again i decided to play a
wizard again, and to start from scratch.  I did however use my higher level
wizard to help my lower level one.  By the time my wnew wizard was level 10
he had Jboot's and Staff of Temperate Flux.

    If you dont have any higher level friends you will have to when until
you are high enough to do the quest solo.  I realise that doesnt help you
much, i am sorry.  However i remembered a good place for you to solo.  You
can quad kite Crag spiders in EK i believe at your level.  if you are not
sure on quad kiting visit the forums at www.graffe.com you arent high enough
level to have your AE snare yet but the Crag's are quaddable without it.
Failing that head to South Karana there should be plenty to solo there to
get you through some of the toughest levels in your wizards life (20 - 24)
Good luck :)
