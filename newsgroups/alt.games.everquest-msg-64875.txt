While it's understandable how frustrating it can be to purchase a
product and not be able to use/play it right away, you have to realize
the complexity behind a product like this.  For some people it helps
to point fingers at the source and yell "MONKEY!" As a c++ programmer
myself, I'd have to be pretty drunk before I called any game
programmer a monkey being as it is one of the most difficult and
intricate forms of programming... let alone an MMORG programmer.  So
you posted and got flamed to hell...  Well, that's kind of expected
seeing as everyone who has problems comes here and bitches.  Something
this huge is going to have a crapload of bugs.

1.) There is no way to test how the product will work on every type of
computer/operating system/system configuration out there.  I am
willing to bet that their QA/Testing team did test it on several of
the most popular/common combinations before releasing it... Any big
software company does that.

2.) As far as the long patch downloads, I'm also willing to bet they
did infact boost the bandwith to their patch servers in preperation,
obviously just not enough or the bottleneck occured somewhere else... 
Either way, how do you test something like that before the actual
release?

One of the smoothest launches I know of is DAoC and even that had its
share of problems and constant re-patching throughout the next few
weeks.

As for myself, other than the long patch downloads, I had no other
problems installing SoL.  Windows ME also went in smooth too.

Perhaps you have a detailed roll-out plan as to how Verant could have
better approached this release?  Of course, if you are not a
programmer, I do not expect you to match wits with one.  However,
these are *monkeys* we are dealing with, so I'm sure you can enlighten
us =)

For the record, I do not work for Verant.  I'm sure the same logic
that produces "verant programmers are monkeys" would be pretty quick
to disregard and label anyone who defends Verant as Verant employees.

p.s. I do not expect a serious reply to this post as most of your
other replies have something to do with sucking dicks.
