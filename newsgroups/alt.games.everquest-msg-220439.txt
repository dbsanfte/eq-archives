Like others have said so far, I think it's a great idea...this coming from
a ranger no less who would be jealous of the warriors. :) I guess coming
from old-school D&D where specialization was a warriors strength, though,
I'm likely to feel it makes perfect sense.  WHen *all* you study are
fighting arts...no magic, outdoor survival, or religion...just pure "how
do I use this thing to kill someone?" skills...you *should* have a chance
to excel at weapons.

It's got my vote! Heck, I'd play a warrior if they added this, just for
the RP spice it adds. :)
