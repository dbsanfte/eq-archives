Theory is demonstratably wrong. I think the first time I was in a group that
killed Pyz was ~April '99. Silverlock who posts to this forem got the GBS.
Trust me, we were just blasting everything in the ruins vs letting the dark
skeletons live.

I have killed her myself probably a dozen times while hunting for bone chips
for my necro. She pops just fine killing everything in the area.

Difference is, I load up on bone chips and move on. If Pyz happens to pop, I
kill her. If someone is already camping the ruins I pretty much let them
camp. Like I said, often high level players camping her will see my necro
and they are savy enough to know why I am there and just hand out a few bone
chips: I leave with or w/o them.

He said he was able to get her to spawn on average of 4 RL hours which I
don't know if I want to accept as honest or judge to be significantly faster
then what I have seen. I've seen her pop probably a dozen times now and I
don't think I have spent a total of 10 hours at the ruins. I do have a
tendancy to go by there at the right time.

Here is what I know. Tovax is spawned and walks behind the guard tower
apparently waiting for someone/quest. Depending on his trigger, I don't know
what it is, he will then walk to the ruins and drop a letter and hoof it
back to his hilltop above the Sayers.

If you pick up the note, it is from S'ragg<He is Sragg the SK guildmaster in
the Qeynos aqueducts> and written to Opal Darkbriar, asking for help dealing
with the Temple.

If you ID the GBS from Pyz, it is supposed to come up as "Varsoon's heart".
I haven't verified that bit myself.

Now considering the nature of the game, Ever'Quest', a rational person would
deduct the Pyz spawn has everything to do with Tovax, Sragg, Varsoon, and
precious little to do with the dark skeletons beyond maybe killing the PH.
Since Tovax has Scruffy for a PH during the day, reasonable to assume
whatever the trigger is, Pyz will not spawn while there is no Tovax around.

It is one of the longest standing unsolved quests in the game assuming it
isn't broken. Damn hard to solve it when Pyz's life expectancy is about 5
seconds, just the way things are so no complaints. That there are
superstitous types that think wearing the same socks every day will make Pyz
spawn more often can just be described as "Peasant Mentality".

Good work! I almost wish she didn't carry the GBS since it would make her
available to a wide range of characters. That or the only way to get the GBS
would be completing the quest part.
