Generally nicknames come in several flavors.

1) shortcuts for long names.  Pally is an example, its shorter than
Paladin

2) shorthand for concepts.  Tank is an example of this. Tank does NOT mean
warrior, although warriors are "tanks" so are paladins and shadowknights.
Tanks are big heavily armored fighting machines.

3) affectionate diminuatives.  Pally is also an example here, cute and
friendly.

4) derogatory diminuatives.  Pally can be an example of this, too, in the
hands of an Evil character, mocking the noble Paladin with this "cute and
fuzzy" nickname.  So too, you'll see Inkie used this way as an insult...
and you might see Inkie used in category 3 by people who have befriended
the dark elves.

5) common nicknames that seem to not fit into any of the above
categories.  Take, for example, Jack... which is a nickname for John.
Both one syllable, both four letters, niether seems to hold any clear
meaning, niether seems particularly affectionate or derogatory... but
there you have it.  Wizzie seems to fit this category.

What I don't see is any reason to categorize any of the above as the
particular province of Gen X slackers.  No language historian, I can think
of examples of all of the above that go back at least as far as WWII,
likely before most people on this newsgroup were born.
