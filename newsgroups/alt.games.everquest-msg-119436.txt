Hotkeys are your friends.  More below.....

My hotkey is something like this:

/pause 5, /pet attack
/say %t is my PET.  Don't waste your mana!

What happens here is that when I hit the hotkey it immediately tells the 
pet to attack my current target, then pauses 0.5 seconds, and then says,
'<target> is my PET.  Don't waste your mana!'
As soon as I hit the /pet attack hotkey I hit F1 twice which selects first 
me, then my pet.  The /pause 5 gives me enough time so that 90% of the 
time my pet is targeted before the /say kicks in.

> I also can't time things well enough to be sure of not attempting to

When I charm-fight, I make it a point to stay out of reach of the mobs, so 
I don't care about keeping the victim targetted.  I pick my pet, start 
singing charm from a LONG way away, and as soon as it hits, target the 
victim, hit my /pet attack hotkey, and hit f1 twice to re-target my pet.  

Then the timing comes into play.  Once charm is hitting and holding, it 
will last for about 18 seconds.  I've found that if as soon as charm hits 
I start selos up, and I wait until it pulses a third time, I can stop 
selos, restart charm, and catch my pet almost directly after charm breaks.  
You will then have to re-target your victim and hit /pet attack again.  
If you have been hit and you're twisting selos and hymn, you will have 
time to twist them both twice before restarting charm.

Don't leave charm on, it's a bad habit that will bite you when you get the 
upgraded charm that uses mana.

Nah, the idea is to not get hit, and not have the mob on you.  Have the 
victim worry about your pet, not about you.

You can do this, but there isn't a lot of reason to do this more than 
every cycle or so.  I prefer to never switch pets, because charm is a huge 
aggro, and I just don't like having to snare the mob so my new pet can 
beat on the back.  If my pet is losing, I let charm run out, then just use 
DoTs or bellows to kill it, then kill the other one.

Bad idea, getting hit hurts.

I always turn off charm as soon as it hits, so I can start my timing 
songs.  Charm-fighting is all about timing, and as you move up to 
swarm-kiting, you'll really appreciate the timing you learned early on.

Nope, they don't.  No bard buffs affect pets.

The best way is distance.  Get FAR away from your pet and your target, if 
you're pet is beating on your target, the target will soon give up chasing 
you and concentrate on his recently turned insane buddy.

The idea is to pick two of the same mob, so that they are about the same 
toughness, and have them both down 80% or more before you kill the first 
one. 
Learning which mobs to charm can be tough, so I'll help you out.  I 
practiced on the gnolls by the spires in SK, then moved up to the cyclops 
in Rathe Mtns.  Basically you want hard-hitting warrior mobs, that don't 
run too fast.

Charming as crowd-control is good, but if you're tying up 2, mez instead.  
When charm breaks and both beat on you until you recharm, you become a 
burden on the healer.

This is a huge advantage when soloing as a bard.  The trick is to charm 
your pet, give the /pet guard here command (I use a hotkey) and run away 
twisting selos and hymn so you get a bit of distance.  That way when charm 
breaks, you can repeat until you're healed enough to keep fighting.

Yep, this is a very useful trick if your healer is being attacked.  I used 
it this week in Chardok when our MA went down.  Charm the mob, give 
everyone a few seconds to get emergancy heals off, then when it breaks it 
attacks you rather than the healer.

Yep, so as soon as charm hits, I have selos up for a fast get-away.  Your 
pet cons amiably to you while charmed, indifferent to everyone else.  Once 
charm breaks though, he's no longer your buddy.

Invis will break charm, it will not remove you from the hate list.  Bards 
have the hide skill, which should break charm, though there is talk that 
it may be broken currently.  The charm only lasts for a maximum of 18 
seconds though, so I usually just let it time out.  High-level bards can 
get an range-slot item that casts a self-invis in about 1.5 seconds, but I 
still just let charm time out in almost every case.

Subject to MUCH debate.  The general consensus is that it has a minor 
effect.  More is good, but how much, and to what point is not yet 
quantified.  Basically, get CHA up above 120-145 (depending on who you 
ask) and don't worry about it after that.

Less resists I hear, and that's what my experience shows.  I haven't done 
a large-scale, controlled experiment, so I may be seeing what I expect to 
see.

Generally you won't want to charm mobs with high MR.  Charm is MR based, 
and Pixie Strike will lower MR, but when you charm a mezzed mob, you end 
up with a mezzed pet, and they don't do many tricks.  I wouldn't worry 
about the tash-stick, it's really not worth it.  If a mob is so MR as to 
need debuffs to charm, you generally don't want to mess with charming that 
mob.

You want to look for big, slow, hard-hitting mobs.  Giant class mobs work 
great for this, though with all the expansions you have a lot more to play 
with than just Rathe Mts and Everfrost.
One of the best places for a bard, especially after practicing on Rathe 
Mtn cyclops for a level or two, is the Choon/Froon in West Karana.  I was 
able to solo them pretty well for exp when they were even con to me, and 
the respawn is fast enough that by the time you get healed back up, 
they're almost respawned.
Basically, the thing to remember about charming is to NOT GET HIT.  Stuns 
suck, and going LD is a guaranteed way to die.  Check out www.eqdiva.com 
if you haven't already, there are several guides to bard charm-kiting and 
swarm-kiting there which are very well written.
