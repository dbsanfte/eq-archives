?

I am going on non-nodrop items, and trying to buy the stuff :)

In cases where I can't find it, I will substitute items as needed...

Yeah, I forgot to update that one :)

I think I'd like the added dex. I like soloing when it's 3am PST and I 
can't find a group, so extra procs help a lot.

? Are you on crack?

14/20 > 10/17, bigtime.

Primary 
    	    	    	Set 1    	      	  	Set 2
Weapon        Entwood Mace(14/20)    	Silverfang Club(10/17) 
Modal     	39     	    	    	    	31

That was computed with a level 60 Monk with 200 STR. I would expect the gap 
to lessen a bit with a higher leveled monk (damage bonus gets higher) and 
higher STR, so let's look at that:


Primary 
    	        	 Set 1     	    	    	Set 2 
Weapon     	Entwood Mace(14/20)     Silverfang Club(10/17) 
Modal     	41     	    	    	    	33 
Compared Modal 2.05     	    	    	1.94117647058824

Maximum     	83.98     	    	    	63.7 

So in other words, the Ent still rules.

75HP is nice, but not nice enough for me to hobble my damage output.

> are you human or iksar?

Human.

Yeah, I have been thinking of swapping it to something with AC/HPs. Or SVM.

Yeah, my other thought was Dragon Tooth Choker 8AC 5Str 5vsMg 10vsFire 
5vsCold 5vsPos 30HP 0.9Wt. I'll probably shoot for that, then.

Yes, I try to keep resists higher than most monks. Resisting a root or a 
slow can be the difference between dying and living. Then again, 50HP could 
be too.
