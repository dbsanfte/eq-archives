If the problem is fairly new, I would suspect a dinged (corrupted)
file, not the datarate setting.

First thing I would do is delete all of the *.TXC (texture cache
files) in your EQ directory if you are caching textures.

If that doesn't resolve the issue, I would then rename the
eqclient.ini to eqclient.old and let a new INI file be created. You
will lose almost all of your customized settings, so rename the
existing file don't delete it! That way you can restore the original
file if this isn't the problem.

You could also delete the zone files like you mention, but personally
I would move them to another directory instead of deleting for testing
purposes.
