Thereare two ways you can go about getting rid of it.

1. Go into CONTROL PANEL-->SERVICES and disable it.

2. Go to http:\\windowsupdate.microsoft.com and install WinXP Service
Pack 1. This will update WinXP to the latest patch level, AND it will
put the Messenger Service in the ADD/REMOVE SOFTWARE window so that
you can remove it like any other program.

Good Luck!
