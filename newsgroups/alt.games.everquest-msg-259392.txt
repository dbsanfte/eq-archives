Its the innorruuk one, and its not really horribly useful as it has a 
long cast time and a short duration; as a shaman I didn't find it nearly 
as useful as I'd thought.  It -is- good for stopping runners, but not 
all that useful for root rotting... then again, I'm not much of a root 
rotter, preferring to sit ahorse in melee range of a mob, allowing it to 
beat on me while I alternate canni and stoicism, and let my pet kill it 
(sitting mounted with attack off, you get sitting mana regen even though 
the mob in melee range of you is trying to beat you to a pulp)

Sadly, the clicky snare isn't much good there either, as I have 
difficulty channeling it thru a beating, and by 6 seconds after a mob 
has started to run its usually out of range of the snare!

The proc one is Sap Encrusted Branch, drop off Tunare in POG, proc rate 
is pretty decent (of course thats with cleric on Primal so his dex is 
capped, but so would it be for a shaman); perhaps if you could rely on 
the mob being snared by the time it turned to run that would open up 
more targets to you for melee killing.  Or perhaps not, remember my 
shaman never got past 52, though I might go back to him some day, it is 
a fun class to play around with.
