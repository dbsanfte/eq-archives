There is a point there - Many people (judging by their posts in
the SWG forums) have what are (IMO) unreasonably high expectations
for this game.  I saw the same thing prior to release of DAoC
as well.  These people become disillusioned VERY quickly and tend
to slam the game and the developers.  For these people I feel
quite confident in saying "SWG will be nowhere near as cool
as they think."  

I think some variant of "No plan survives contact with reality" should
be our mantra as we approach one of these games.  The devs have many
ideas that, on paper, would seem to equate to a great game.  However,
these gameplay mechanics, while they may work in the small community
of Beta may fall apart completely when exposed to live servers with
thousands of players going their own way.

One thing I worry about is the almost complete reliance on PC's in
every step of the crafting process.  As crafters move up in their
chosen skill, they lose the ability to make the more basic sub-
assemblies in favor of the ability to put those together in a finished
product.  The question I have, is will there always be enough 
people with a character at the appropriate skill level to make 
those sub-assemblies to supply to the higher end folks?
