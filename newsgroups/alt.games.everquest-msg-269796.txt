In my opinion, a death penalty has to be enough to where you take steps
to avoid dying.  That's really all it has to be.  As long as dying is
something you don't want to do, then you're going to get that element
of risk into the game and you're all set.  You don't need to be losing
hours upon hours worth of gameplay in order to have a good game with
danger and tension.

When any of my WoW characters are out exploring/questing and I get low
on hp I'm running and thinking "oh crap it's going to take me forever
to run back out here from Brill and by then all the guards will have
repopped and I'll have to fight my way into the tower all over again."
It is quite enough of an incentive to stay alive to where my blood is
pumping as I wonder if my Sprint will hold out longer than the mobs
will pursue me.

There's still enough of a downside to dying that I don't want to do it,
but on other hand it isn't so much that I mind exploring.  When I
played EQ I moved from camp spot to camp spot.  As soon as I learned an
area well I would stay there until it greened out on me, because I
liked knowing the land and knowing what to expect.  I explored only
slowly and carefully and always tried to hunt near zone lines.  I
missed a lot of content -- especially dungeons -- because I was
unwilling to risk all my character's possessions by dying somewhere I
couldn't retrieve my corpse from.  I don't have that problem at all
with WoW, and I have wandered all over the place looking for treasure
chests and settlements and whatnot.  I am enjoying exploring instead of
fearing it.
