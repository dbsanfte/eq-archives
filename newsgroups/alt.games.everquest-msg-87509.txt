That's true enough but I think people would be surprised to find out
how similar the levels 14-20 are to (nonhell) levels 30-45. It's not
nearly as big a difference as people thing. The fights and possibly
downtime if they're soloing are just longer.

One of my twinks almost always solos in one zone for an entire level,
so the log file shows a pretty accurate depiction of how many kills
per level it takes to level, and its surprising in some ways.
