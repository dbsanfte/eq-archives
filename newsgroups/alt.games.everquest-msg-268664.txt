Lol...reminds me of something that happened yesterday.

I recently accepted an invitation to a guild, and some twit in guild 
chat wanted to know where to take his 13th level for good xp... so I 
suggested Kurns or PC. He had never heard of Kurns and claimed he was 
too low for B1&B2.

So... i told him Kurns was in FoB at the north end of the pit, and that 
even if he was too low for B1&B2 he could easily get mobs he could take 
from the Shar Vahl side, coming in through Shadeweavers.

He seemed to disbeleive me about PC, and wanted to know where FoB was.

I was floored. I told him it was off the PoK via the Cabilis book, and 
that once he was in FoB, he would just head north, until he found the 
pit, and that the tower was at the north end of the pit.

He asked for an escort to Kurns.

I was floored. Told him he didn't need one, that he couldn't possibly 
miss it, and that there were a dozen people in FoB he could ask for 
directions if he managed to lose himself (I had just passed through FoB 
on the way to Kaesora to get an HS key)

No more chatter... 20 minutes go by, a guild officer logs in, says 
hello, and gets invited to a group by some guildies... and then responds 
he'll be right there, but first he's got to show xxxxxx where Kurn's is.

I was floored.

Now this is supposedly a 45+ guild, which begs the question of why a 
clueless and helpless 13th level newbie was in it... so I asked the guy 
who his main was... turns out he has no less than 5 50+ characters. So I 
asked him point blank how the hell he didn't know what and where FoB was 
with so many 50+ chars.

Claims he always leveled in CB and then PC B1&B2...

I have feeling his 25th-55th levels were also played in maybe 3 zones.

The guild isn't impressing me as a whole so far, but this twit takes the 
cake.

I really don't want to be raiding with a guy who needs an escort to 
Kurns Tower. Looks like its already time to find another guild.
