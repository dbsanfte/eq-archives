Well what can I say, it sure is different.    If you don't like spoilers
then you should probably stop reading this post.

We explored it last night.. cleared it first when the servers came up (2
primal 1hb's and 1 primal poker..  very awesome)..  read reports of other
servers having the new ST (ours was still the old one).. eventually about
8.30pm EST the gm came and said it would be updated in 10 mins... yippe!

Channels were down all night.. that sucked ass.   No puller channel, no raid
channel, no healer channel, no officer channel to decide loots...  was
shitty to go the entire night without them, but we struggled on.....

Upon zoning in, you immediatly see a series of mobs in a semi circle around
you, kos and untargettable (if you click it, you lose the target a second
later)

Open the door.. where there used to be a golem, are now 2 flying golems
(same model as ancient caretaker).
They agro at the doorway, so plan on fighting these both at the same time.
Hit for 340's pretty fast, not many hp.

Where the MotG room is, is now a ton of untargettable big golems.  All
around the bottom level are more flying golem models.   This place is a
pullers nightmare..  virtually every mob is a caster, you get nuked for
1.6k, rooted on pulls, and if you get more than a couple agro, splitting
them (or even staying alive) just isn't gonna happen.  FD is broken so much.

MotG is an interesting fight..  all I will say is it does have something to
do with those untargetable golems :)

Clear the whole room and the stuff at the doors (to prog, and library)..
another named mob will pop in MotG room.

Prog.. well shitbirds are now level 50.  No more direcharm :/   Progy is now
unslowable.  All 3 (motg, prog, fa) got a pretty hefty HP increase.

Theres an npc in the room opposite prog, talk to him and he gives a 10slot
giant sized 0.1 weight container.

Go to the library, the npc there tells you that this is where the real
difficulties begin.   Library is the usual mix of ancient caretakers (with a
diff name) and now new wyverns.  Again all casters, not too bad to single
pull though.

Theres a named mob in library, 600dmg a tick for 5 ticks uncurable curse..
hes a nasty bugger.

Just past there are specs, these guys are necros with deadly spells.  I had
2 dots on me, and even with celestial elixir my hp was going down.

FA...  pretty much similar to before.  Was hitting for 800ish, much much
more HP.. and we fought him in a diff location this time.

On each warder pad is a new dragon, theres 2 mobs that patrol half of it
each... these are pretty interesting!

We used to clear ST with 1-2 groups.. and because of the drops, only melees
and clerics (plus a shaman and chanter or 2) ever got keys... wow will that
change.

Its always fun fighting new mobs, having no clue at all what their ae or hp
is.. we had to find out the hard way.
The first one, has an 1100dmg ae, and ae snare.  Boy that was fun to pull!

Number 2 has got a 500 dd with dispell. Was immune to slow.  Hi ragefire
with more HP :)

Number 3 was a pain in the ass... 1k dmg and slow was his ae.   Slow...
just the thing you want when 99.9999% of your ST raid crew is a melee...

Number 4 - this dude had a 1500 dmg ae and (iirc) a dispell.

Tons and tons of quest items... I guess its gonna take a while before they
are all discovered.  Some of the loot includes 100hp and haste bp's, which
is pretty nice.  Some of the "new warder" loot sucked so bad, it rotted.
Some damage 3 focus masks were nice, and a pretty sweet cleric bracer
dropped.  The slippers rotted (check alla when they make it on, you will see
why)

General opinion.. well its much better than it was prior.  There may be
toooo many mobs there now though.. I mean seriously, it has more mobs than
NToV.

Its jumped from the difficulty level of umm..lord bob in Velks, to nToV
level.  Small guilds and those with only a few keyed are pretty much shut
out of anything deep in now... I expect joint guild raids and increased
demand on broods now.

Now we need to start keying druids and wizards.. bleh :)
