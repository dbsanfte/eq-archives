They were just more fun.  High teens in Luclin was PC basically.  In fact,
virtually all of Luclin was kinda un-fun.  Kunark for high teens Warsliks,
LoIO, Dalnirs, Kurns, maybe some parts of OT.  Hmmm, that other dungeon
of off FoB was kinda fun for the right levels, forget it's name.  But still
mainly ok grinding and not a whole lotta fun. Velious, Frozen Shadows, buncha
outdoor zones.  Best fun in Velious was IMHO in Siren's Ghetto.  LoY's 
two best zones again are just out of the level range, Hate's Fury and the
zone preceeding it.  Undead female bouncing troll boob is a visual spectacular
that everyone should be punished with at least once.  LDoN could maybe prove
amsuing for a herd of necros/mages.  There are some interesting maps there.
PoP, nada, well the goblin caves in Nightmare can be fun.  Rest of it was
just a loot/raid/grind expansion.  Oppps, I must also now confess to a certain
fondness for Torment, was nicely laid out to move around and not camp.
GoD...vile vile expansion.  PoP on crystal meth and PMS.  Come to Darkhollow and
Serpents I really have no sense of funness for either.  Prolly got too
jaded by that time. :)

But some of the old world zones had real character.  Unrest and Mistmoore
SolB,  Rathe Mtns 1.0, the Guks, Cazic 1.0, Kedge (best zone ever!).  I
just don't personally think that the effort to create a definiteive "feel"
for a zone was exerted in the expansions.  YMMV
