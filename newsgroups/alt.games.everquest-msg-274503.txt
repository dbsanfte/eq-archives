Okay, can someone explain to me why my husband and I missed this
series when it was first run? After hearing a few comments here
in the newsgroup and while Christmas shopping, I ended up buying
the series for my husband for a Christmas gift. We've loved it
and we just can't figure out why we didn't watch it when it was
on. Did they change the timeslot a lot?
