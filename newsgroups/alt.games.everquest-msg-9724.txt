National Guard is *A* militia.  Guess what, so were most of those
handgun and shotgun owners.  Guess what, a 30-06 will do just fine to
drop you and take that nice rifle that will sustain firepower. 
Automatic support weapons aren't necessary.  minimal training, hotheads,
ineffective militia, I think thats what the British said before
Lexington and Concord.  the concept of a militia will never be dated. 
For a lesson on the effectivenes of *A* militia, watch the patriot
again.  BAH, Just because you can't or won't purchase automatic weapons
for your militia/home use doesn't mean they can't be acquired, in the
very near future, the 2nd ammendment will either be emasculated, or the
supreme court will rule that military hardware falls under the 2nd
ammendment.

is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
