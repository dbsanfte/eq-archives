I have noticed that there is an array of horses,that can be purchased in the
Bazaar.My Question is,"Has anyone developed a table of slowest to fastest"
and est cost as you increase in speed?It still seems to me that the Jboot
Quest or even the purchase of Tboots is a better deal for speed verses
pp's.I may be wrong on this assumption and any information would be a big
help.I've went to most of the major EQ websites and no table or information
on the horses is posted.
