There was a newspaper article (in the Kaladim paper) about renewing dwarf
relations between the Coldain and Kaladim dwarves. Thurbr Axebringer himself
went to visit the Coldain, and brought several cases of beer. Seems that the
Coldain emissaries couldn't hold their beer well, and almost got the party
killed when they were jumped by Frost giants. Needless to say, Thurbr wasn't
pleased, and he's recommended that the King not further any relations with
these Coldain. If they can't hold their booze, they aren't proper dwarves,
and don't deserve to live in Kaladim.
