I've been tracking the phase for ages as I was trying to figure out whether
to buy that or an imbued fighters staff (6.5k) when the price leapt. There's
one going for 13.5k that probably won't be there much longer, if only
because i'll get it if no-one else does, but I track prices in a  few items
(forest loops are up, crystalline silk swatch down)

I earn about 2k per week in realtime so that's about 3 weeks the price
hovered around the 6k market, then just as i dithered whether the staff
should be bought instead, bang went the price.

And if you are earning 20k a week, i can only assume you are playing a lot
more than I am. I mostly check my mule, write down prices, then go back to
tedious real time stuff like working, cleaning, cooking, shopping,
socialising and seeing movies.

I think it's funny that when i was starting this article, there were 2 fungi
tunics on sale, one for 57k, the other for 60k. The 57k one is gone. I
remember in auction channel some weeks ago, this guy was trying to offload
one for 50K and meeting howls of laughter.So i guess this price increase
might be a complete coincidence, or it might be related to PoP, but no, i
don't think it's stupid to suggest that there's a possible correlation
between the most extreme nerf in monk history and a price change in high ac
monk wearable goods.
