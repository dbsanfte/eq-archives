Double speak.

The data that is omitted would go far toward putting in perspective the
change and completely belie that their intent was "Warrior > Knight > Monk >
Bard > Ranger = Beastlord = Rogue" (or make me question their programming
ability).

A comparison to *cloth* classes might be enlightening, knowing that "the
nerf was partially repealed and the monk AC cap was *raised* to the same level
as druids and beastlords", and especially in light of the unelaborated
"Class AC caps were changed. Monks were lowered the most".

The omission of data above level 60, on the eve of an expansion raising the
level to 65, is downright suspicious.  =)

And with what little hard data is included, the figures are skewed by the
methods (i.e., parsed "against NPCs 3-4 levels lower"), especially in light
of the changes the right hand was making with mob levels in PoP and the exp
bonus given to fighting higher level mobs shortly after the PoP release.
