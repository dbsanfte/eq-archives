I got back into AO again, compared to EQ its instant gratification.
One thing I love about AO is that even after a year, due to not being
as popular I guess, there is not much info floating around about the
game. People in it don't know everything, there are tons of skills to
add points too (WHICH ALL MATTER!!!!!) and no skills by use You level
and apply the points you get to whatever you want from tradeskills,
stats, nano stuff, melee stuff, whatever.

Yeah, sucky thing about AO is the newsgroup has like one or two posts
a day.. weird. The AO official forums are pretty active though.
