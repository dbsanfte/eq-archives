I have a 29 Level Druid, but I am pretty sure my wisdom is well below where
it should be.  With the Testament of Vanear, I just recently copleted, I am
at 121 Wisdom.  All my friends at work, who are much higher level, say that
I REALLY need to be concerned about my wisdom.  I tend to be a solo player,
not being able to play for long periods makes it difficult sometime to get
in (or stay in) a group.  Since I have all my 29 ports, I can make a fair
amount of PP, but I'm really not sure what to do next.
