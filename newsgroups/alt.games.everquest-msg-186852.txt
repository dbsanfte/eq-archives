That may have been true when the server started, but it's not the case
anymore. Evil team certainly is not PvP lite, in fact there really
isn't any zones that evil team can claim ownership of. By far the
largest, and best equiped guilds are on the neutral team, with evil
and good being more even with each other.

Try leveling up a newbie evil on SZ for yourself, and you'll see what
I mean when packs of level 60+ neutral rangers prowl your newbie zones
looking for young evils to corpse camp and exp kill.
