I knew what you meant.  It was clear that you were somehow confounding 
plurality and universality.  And the argument being put forth was heavily 
invested in the difference between the two. :)

}> 'Most popular and used' isn't even the same as 'used by the majority',

}But 42 already USED the term. So the concept of a 'universal browser' is 
}out there. If SOMETHING has to fill the slot what comes closest? There's 
}only one answer to what comes closest to being a universal browser that

}oneupmanship and that's IE.

Ahh... but 42 said, 'not a universal browser'.  He didn't say that a 
universal browser existed, only that IE was -not- one.  Closest to a 
universal browser it still -not- a universal browser.  And SoE choosing to 
behave as if their choice is universal is still foolish.  Even if they're 
only inconveniencing 5% of the people, is it a good idea to inconvenience 
5% of the people for no good reason?  If it's perfectly easy, and requires 
no more work or investment of resources to make everyone happy, why not 
make everyone happy, instead of 95%?  And note that that 95% figure is 
probably a very high estimate. :)
