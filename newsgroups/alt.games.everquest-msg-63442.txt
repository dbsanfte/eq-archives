Time to dust of the level 35 Necro, haven't played him in 6 months or so.
Well here is my question for pet classes. Which is better for a dual
wielding pet bare hands or a pair of Velium weapon? If I remember correctly
Verant changed the Pets hitting abilities with weapons or something to that
nature.

Thanks
