I have a relatively low opinion of doctors myself (Relative to how 
others view doctors, not in relation to how I view others) they are far 
more human than many of us credit them with being.

And therefore you have to be prepared to accept their decision, and 
support it, and fight to preserve their right to make that choice again. 
Even if you don't agree with it. That is freedom.

Of course. You are welcome to take someone elses choice, evaluate it 
with your value system, and conclude whatever you want. But that is 
where it must stop. If you take the next step and meet out consequenses 
against them because they failed you're test you've gone too far.

Suggesting they should be shot, even for dramatic effect is pretty 
hurtful... they may have agonized for months over whether to have a 
child... and then for you to show up totally uninformed and characterize 
anyone who has a child with foreseeable bad genetics as irresponsible 
dolts who don't deserve to live is beyond politically incorrect, its 
moved into the realm of just plain arrogance.

The church cannot satisfy the rest of humanity that it is the ultimate 
authority, and so is unsuitable to judge us. Convincing a few of us 
absolutely is insufficient.

And everyone else works to set up a system where the politos, soldiers, 
fanatics and whatever can do the least amount of damage.

There are a number of countries that I beleive have better overall 
systems. None of them are perfect but the US could learn a lot from 
several countries in Europe and Canada too.
