You shouldn't be KoS in OT unless you hunted the ogres in Timorous Deep.  They
are on Venril Something faction, not Oggok faction.  While the old world ogres
want to whoop our erudite butts, even though we worship the same god, (why is my
brell worshipping dwarf Dubious to the guards with no faction work, and having
killed numerous Corflunk/zarchoomis, but my Erudite necro worshipping Cazic
thule KOS, someone screwed up on faction bases somewhere I think) The OT is
actually run by Dark Elves not Ogres.  Take the raft from Oasis to timorous
deep, and carefully con the ogres from a distance, you shouldn't be kos but that
is one way to make sure.  If you are KOS just invis, go around not between the
firepots at the dock and wait for the boat to arrive at the end of the dock. 
Even if gather shadows drops you should be out of aggro range at the end of the
dock.  When the bloated Belly arrives hop on and when it zones into OT, just hop
off and swim to shore outside the walls. and no guards will aggro you there.  I
don't think you will be KOS to the OT, but I have been wrong before.
