Still doesn't say that they are planning a character for the US show.
"discussing" means just that, it doesn't mean "planning".

yes.  I know that they can.  I've actually taken the time to talk with 2 yr
olds on many occasions. They can most certainly understand that.

Yep.  I'm a parent.  Between my own kids and kids I've worked with I've been
around approx 200-250 2 yr olds.  I'd say that all of them could understand
the basis of this.

When I "work with kids" I do so in an educational setting.  I started out as
a care provider, then taught in a special needs preschool, then a YMCA based
preschool.

At no point was it ever stated that the kids would be exposed to sexual
activity.  All that has been stated was that there would be a character who
is HIV positive.  You have turned this into a sexual statement.

It is possible to "let them be kids" without shutting them away from the
world, or without avoiding questions that they have.

I didn't pick anything.  You are the one who has determined that this is not
appropriate for any child, based on the belief that it was not appropriate
for your own child.
