Try Sol A in lava storm mountains. I think the bonus there is 18% (Dont
quote me on that one) but i've had a couple of people say its 18% (ish) and
i went there and the xp was quite nice for what we were killing. The levels
around that place are about 24-32 give or take a level.

Also Unrest has a bonus i think, but im not really sure so check first.
