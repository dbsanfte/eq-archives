I have two archers. I wouldn't mind bows being better, but they are good
enough as is.

Snare and run backwards while shooting a mob is kind of a tried and true
technique. You seldom take any damage and the cost of summoned arrows is
insignificant to nothing.

The only thing that would change is the amount of time it takes to get a mob
dead or low enough on health to melee. It would be like a druid asking for
Stinging Swarm to do more damage faster. Not that it wouldn't benefit the
class, just that it would change the game balance.
