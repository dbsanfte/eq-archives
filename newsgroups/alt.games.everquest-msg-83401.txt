No, it WAS 'too obscure', but now, according to the logic of this thread, 
it is no longer.  Come on folks, obscene names are bad, we all agree on 
that, but if you are truly offended by Dabasha Dasmasha, maybe you need 
to play a character that doesn't require you to sit and med for hours on 
end.
I have been in every single pre-Luclin zone other than ST, have a hell of 
a lot more days /played that most, have soloed, duoed, grouped, and 
raided with strangers, friends, guildies, whatnot, and still don't see 
one-tenth the offensive names that you (especially you DT) come across.  
I have come across several offensive names, and I have /petitioned them.  
I have also let several slide, including Greenbudd Reddhair who was 20 
when I first saw him and 50something when I last saw him.  He wore green 
armor, had red hair, didn't bother anyone that I saw.  Hell, I even 
reported a guildmember (now former guildmember due to his immaturity) for 
having the surname Beastlynutz, turns out he had the same name removed 6 
times previously.  Fucking lame-ass GMs, just ban him.
Anyway, the name freaks are just looking like assholes at this point.  I 
think we're in agreement that obscene names need to be removed, and 
idiots with Leegolas, Phroodo, Driztt type names need to be ignored.  Can 
we please just leave it at that.

Arolpin
sure that his name means pierced penis or something in mongolian
