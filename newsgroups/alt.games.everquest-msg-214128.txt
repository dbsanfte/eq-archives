Go ahead, then.  Show me a cleric who says they can get equal or better XP
soloing than they can get from a group.

I'll show you a cleric who is full of it.  =)

There was a fanatic cleric on the EQClerics forums for a while who was all
about how he had a SoD and could solo faster than any group.  While he could
get XP at an impressive rate, many many other clerics came forward with
group examples that far outstripped his solo example.

And keep in mind that cleric was uber-equipped for the express purpose of
soloing.

The long and short of it is this: clerics are not a soloing class, and will
*always* be able to get better XP in a group than they ever could soloing.
