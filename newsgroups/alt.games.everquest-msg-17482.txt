A druid twink of an uberguild could do the epic at level 20 - foraging
skill 101 is a requirement for the rare forages and the only level
requirement, since no planar drops are needed.

Seems people always forget the Sky, Growth and Mischief quests can't
be done before 46+ when they claim the epics are the only ones that
can't be done till that level :)
