I was killing time waiting for a group to show up in sebilis, and I sicc'd
my puppy on the frogs some people were hunting at the zone line, cause I
wanted to raise my cabilis trooper faction so I could throw bone chips on
them.

After the first 5 frogs, I noticed that despite my pet meleeing with them
the entire time, I never got a single faction adjustment, so I started
nuking the frogs too, and things became normal.
