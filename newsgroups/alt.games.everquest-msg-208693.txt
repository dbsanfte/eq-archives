I kinda like the chetari wardstaff, has +14 int to it and 5ac, but is 2hb.
Thought horror scalp is good too, has +5% research, a plus
do the diamond inlaid mask quest in POK, excelent exp and spell haste
black alloy medalion, mana preservation II
the bat skull earrings, regent conservation and +5 int each, nice and cheap
just right there is about give or take 30 additional int points,
I hope that helps
Too many toons to list on too many servers, I have no life.
