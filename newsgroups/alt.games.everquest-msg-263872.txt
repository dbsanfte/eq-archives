Not as far as I've seen, though I will admit, I haven't seen a whole
lot overall. Not many quests for the crafter side, though. That would
help a lot. But, even if you do some adventuring, if you're wanting to
focus on crafting, it still could be more advantageous to your primary
goal to take foraging.
