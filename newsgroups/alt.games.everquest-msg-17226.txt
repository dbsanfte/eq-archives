I REALLY need to make some money.  I'm only a level nine character, and I
thought baking might be a good trade skill for me to learn so I could get some
money.  But after reading the faqs on the internet, they said it's more of a
skill for laughs.  Somebody mentioned here that I could use it and make 20 pp
in an hour of baking.  This would be a LOT for me!  Please let me know what you
think about it.
