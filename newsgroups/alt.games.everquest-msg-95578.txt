Well, what you're experiencing isn't lag, but a drop in framerate.  
There is a difference, although a lot of people like to interchange the 
two.  Lag is only a drop in packets sent between you and the server.  
Framerate is how well/fast your computer can draw the game on your 
screen.  So if everything is just "jerky" then your computer is being 
bogged down either by a problem with hardware being sub-par, or due to 
bugs/glitches in the coding.
