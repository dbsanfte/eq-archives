 Some of the necro lines of spell effects are broken kind of differently.
For instance, when casting a lifetap (I believe), the "impact" portion of
the effect on the mob doesn't start displaying until about 6 seconds after
it should. This used to work as you'd expect then sometime in the last 4
months, on or before the "new" spell effects going live, they've been
goofy.

 Very annoying, and making me count one-one-thousand to myself for timing
some things when I used to time them on previous spell effects wearing off.
