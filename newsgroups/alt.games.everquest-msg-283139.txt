Why don't you give all your money and belongings to a tv
evanglist(sp)? Because its know they (mostly*) are frauds and won't be
using your money to 'help the needy' unless said needy is blonde
36-24-36 and is called Candie.

The people who say they aren't going to play Vanguard now that Soe is
in the picture most likely have had bad experiences with Sony in the
past and don't want to fund that kind of service any further.
