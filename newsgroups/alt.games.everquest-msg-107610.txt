You can go through the area of ToV around the entrance where mobs are on CoV
faction, but much of the zone is populated with kos-to-all mobs so you won't
be able to go everywhere.  I'm not sure if you can run freely around WW, but
I believe most, if not all, of the mobs there are on CoV faction.  I don't
think there's much else you can do with it.
