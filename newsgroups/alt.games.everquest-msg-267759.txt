alt.games.diablo,  8938 messages on my news server since 7/24/04
alt.games.diablo2   10483 messages on my news server since 7/24/04

A scan of messages shows that both groups discuss diablo2 or off topic (to
both groups) stuff 99.99% of the time.

By comparison, alt.games.everquest, with no split and with an upturn in
traffic due to EQ2 (and bitching about EQ2 posters) has less than 3000
messages since 7/24/04.
