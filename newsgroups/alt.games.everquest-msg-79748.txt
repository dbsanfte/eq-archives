Easy solution.

Give soulbinder a million HP.  Make them like a 75 level Wizard and give
them the ability to summon a 70th level dragon as their pet who attacks the
person and party that agroed soulbinded.  Then once their threat is
eliminated the dragon goes back into the abys and all the newbies in the
area can clean out their shorts.

Oh.  And each person in party that agroed Soulbinded upon their death will
lose one item of equipment that is random.  Got to love that punk ass 60
warrior in group that loses his epic weapon.

Just my two cents.
