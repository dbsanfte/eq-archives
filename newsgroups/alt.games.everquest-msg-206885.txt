The allowed difference is 5 levels or 2/3rds of the highest level, 
whichever is a greater level span.

For levels 1 to 10, this means 5 levels.  After that, it's 2/3rds of the 
highest level person in the group.  So, at 30, that means 20 would be the 
lowest level that can group with him and get xp.  I have seen some 
weirdness with it, if the mobs are green to the highest level person.

Some people have experimented, and found that 2/3rds of highest level is 
a better fit than 3/2 of lowest level.  The reason being the rounding.
