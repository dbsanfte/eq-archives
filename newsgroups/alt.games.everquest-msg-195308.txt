Sorry for snipping, just wanted to touch on this.

For what it's worth, I want to thank you as well.

I've been playing since the 8th of April, so soon it will be a month!

I've always been VERY grateful for any "buffs" or items anyone has
given me while I tried to kill things, sometimes getting in over my
head.  I also apologize for anyone who simply begs, or demands items.

We aren't all like that, and some of us do have manners and know how
to say "thank you."  I'm glad you ran into someone like that.  I wish
everyone knew please and thank you :)

I've had a great experience on EQ so far, people are very nice as long
as you don't beg/demand items from them.  I was constantly getting
killed with my new character, a Dark Elf Necromancer (finally got the
skeleton pet, what a difference), and someone kindly gave me a Batfang
Headband!  What a great item, +3 INT, +3 WIS and a 2 AC -- needless to
say I thanked him profusely!

Can't wait to be more powerful and be able to help others in turn --
sure, my Paladin and Druidess have some fair low-level heals, but it
will be nice to really help out with things like Levitate (for people
like me who kept falling out of trees in Kelethin) or the famous
Spirit of Wolf :)

It's simple manners.  Treat others as you want to be treated, and I'm
glad you met someone who returned your kindness and generosity with
being nice in return.  It makes all the difference in the experience.
