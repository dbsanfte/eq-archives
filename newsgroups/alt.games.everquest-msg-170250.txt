Now newbies can also sell items in the bazaar by gating up to Luclin or with
POP can take a book right from the newbie grounds without even making the
treacherous journey to the spires.  KOS races? No prob.  All that farmed
spider and spiderling silk can make a newbie a lot of money not to mention
various pelts.  And, all that new found wealth goes a lot further than it
used to.  Yep, there's never been a better time to be a newbie!
