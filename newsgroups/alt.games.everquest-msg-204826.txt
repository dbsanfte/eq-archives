In general, I'd say this is true.  However, I'm a weird exception (as
in most things...;)

I play a cleric and I love it, even on raids.  Do I have a buttload of
fun every night?  No, not even most nights.  What I get out of playing
a cleric is a sense of satisfaction and the feeling of having helped
ensure that a lot of other people have a good time.

Unfortunately one of the guilds that I was in did not appreciate
clerics.  Indeed, everything that went wrong, from bad pulls to
over-aggro'ing enchanters, was the fault of the clerics.  Night after
night the blame was tossed our way, and honestly, I started to hate
this game.

I left that guild and am now recruiting with a guild that has a much
more relaxed feel.  I am happier, so I enjoy my EQ time more.

The point to all of this is that cleric does not have to equal boring
and some of us enjoy it quite a lot - but appreciation of those who do
the job is a must.  At least, that's the prevailing opinion among the
clerics with whom I've healed.

PS:  In my opinion, a guild that disposes of a skilled player simply
because that player doesn't want to play a particular class anymore is
doomed to failure.  Skilled players are too rare to be wasted.
