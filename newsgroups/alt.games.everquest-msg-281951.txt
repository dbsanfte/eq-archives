As of last weekend (haven't logged in in the last couple of days, but
I'd bet even money it's been nerfed by now) it was
EverSplitpawMissions.
103% AA xp at 70 for 3 minutes work by two (one if you were lucky) people?
Then cycle to an alt to avoid the lockout timer - at one point we were
doing it so fast I had to use alts I hadn't even logged in on for years.

Oh wait, patch day. It's been nerfed. Global MM nerf, it looks like:

No more zero-kill missions, I guess.
(and there was a specific nerf for the Paw MM too)
