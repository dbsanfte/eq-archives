    I am having the same problems.  Can you hear the character select music
in the background?  This truly bites, I have a corpse(and of course I am a
bard)that I need to retrieve by Friday, and I am starting to really worry.
    I am running Win 98 DX 8.1 and have a Vodoo 3dfx card.
    Please send any e-mail regarding this issure to maiddaraya@yahoo.com
