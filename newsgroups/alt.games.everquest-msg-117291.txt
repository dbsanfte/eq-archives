I don't see how, I can't imagine how a suicidal person can have an 
enormous strength of character and will.. Please explain me how.. If one 
person is desesparate enough to commit suicide, that can't indicate what 
you said.. Unless the reason why that person killed himself/herself is 
for a completely different reason, but it's obviously not the case of 
this poor boy.

You've been living in a cave and just discovered the modern life? =P
I don't have to like them or not, the decision is either right or wrong, 
and it certainly happened sometimes that it was wrong, do you really 
think the court never make mistake and because they take a decision then 
it's the right decision?

No one decide what the good decision, switch on your brain, the good 
decision is what should punish the right person, but no one is 
omniscient, no one can know, it just appears sometimes that the decision 
taken by the court is too easy and show they didn't want to bother with 
it any longer, hence the several mistakes they could have make.
