http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19279

It is pretty impressive, esp for a 30's weapon.

Drops off:
    * A Deadly Skeletal Sailor
    * A Feral Drogmor
    * A Foul Mushroom
    * A Maniacal Zombie
    * A Vicious Skeleton
    * An Emaciated Zombie

As you can see several of those are gunthak beach mobs.

Terror of Shadows, Terror of Darkness etc... i call them jolt because 
that's the category soe put them in the heirearchical right click memu 
for loading spell gems.

Yeah, given that the sk has clinging darkness and the terror spells, he 
should have been able to at least pull aggro earlier, and even probably 
hold it, especially from a monk who wanted to lose it.
