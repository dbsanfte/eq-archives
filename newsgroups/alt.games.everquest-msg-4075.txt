Well, I play on a satellite modem and ping at 500 to 750 and it is
still very playable. Big difference is damage refresh in combat. With
a slight delay, I may cast or attack one time too many when the
monster is dead. All that happens is you get the "You must select a
target" message and no mana lost. Very small irritation with multiple
mobs, but as long as you know it's there, it never causes death to
party.
