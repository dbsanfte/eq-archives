The quest changed things quite a bit.  The incident I referred to
occurred long before the quest, before Kunark in fact.  Ghoulbane was
still a comparatively powerful weapon, and it was selling for about
6kpp at the time (if you could find one for sale).  The massive glut
of good 2handers that followed the opening of Kunark (giving paladins
an alternative to the M2H or GZ for damage better than GB), along
with the rapid discovery of just how weak post-50 hybrids were at that
time (lotta paladin twinks got mothballed or deleted and their gear
sold off), knocked the market price of GB down under 1500 within 2 or
three months.
