<rant1>

99% of the excitement about the fleeting quiver is because the
*pattern* has been in game since the first beta, but Verant actually
*implemented* the recipe only in the last (or was it the next to
last?) patch. Hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of plat were
spent by trade skillers searching for the formula back when skill
containers ate incorrect combines before Verant actually acknowledged
TWO YEARS after the game's release, "Oops, I guess we missed that
one."

Beyond that, the fleeting quiver requires a HQ lion skin (a very rare
drop off of only 3 rare named mobs), a griffon feather and a vial of
distilled mana (39th level enchanter spell that uses TWO sapphires as
a reagent) along with a tailoring skill of above 212 (the trivial has
not been found.) Yeah, the 66% added haste to arrows out of the
fleeting quiver is very nice, but like the Velious tailored items it
is EXTREMELY unlikely that anyone could make and sell one fleeting
quiver for a price anyone would be willing to pay, much less use them
as a steady source of income.

The ingredients for tailored backpacks are very easy to get ahold of,
and they sell pretty well.
