Let's see, EQ came out in roughly april of 1999. At a rate of a patch every
2 and a half weeks (sometimes its every week, they've one time gone a month
with no patches), that is aproximately 50 times that they have improved the
game. Course, that doesn't include large scale improvements like say, 2 new
continents, as well as the 4 free regular zones, and 2 free plane zone
downloads.

Is your stupidity genetic, the result of cranial trauma, or a willful act?
