Just wondering if there are any guilds or FAQs on PvP play for Rallos Zek?

It's a PVP server. I understand the risk but I was trying to find out if
there is a method to the madness at higher levels.... I play an Iksar Monk
and basically treat it like a non PvP server. I figured if it was PvP then
people might be less inclined to KS or ninja loot.

Funny thing is, I never got PK'd until recently when a flock of D00Ds
started showing on the server.... Maybe school vacation or a bunch xmas
presents for spoiled ones.

Throw me your 2CP, I need the cash.... :)

Pervect, 10th order Iksar Monk
