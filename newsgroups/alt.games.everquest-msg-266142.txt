Even though we have 3 PC's at home and all the usual peripherals (printer, 
scanner, adsl, router) we have avoided that particular problem by spreading

This does have another Nerd Den effect of having a house where blue network 
cable has right of way running into all the rooms and down the corridors 
though...
