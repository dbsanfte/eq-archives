Yep, can't get Lucy, thats me.  But even if I could, it still wouldn't be close to as
handy as just having the info on the item.  I mean, why exactly would they want the
game to keep it a secret?  Given all the other information they are adding in to items
and spells (well, I guess the spell scrolls are items... but then again, the spells in
my spell book also show the information when checked) its just a pain to see this
tidbit held back.  Same applies to concealing the haste %, for that matter.  Any game
critical facts that can only be discovered by long painstaking effort by the player,
or by going to obscure web sites where people who -have- done the work... well they
don't make sense to me, why punish the player who doesn't want to spend hours
researching everything offline?  I just offhandedly mentioned a ZEM to a friend who's
been playing for years, had a 65 druid and 50 monk among other characters, and she'd
never heard of it.  Yet SOE (well I guess it was Verant) was using the ZEM as a tool
to get us to frequent certain more obscure areas like the Hole.

Of course I guess the flip side of this arguement is that those who -are- willing to
do the work to discover the nuts and bolts, and even those of us who are willing just
to do the web searches to feed off their work, get to feel all superior to the run of
the mill player who hasn't got a clue how these things work.  I have to admit getting
a kick out of explaining the ZEM to that old friend as she exclaimed how amazing the
exp was in Kurns.
