Personally I think everywhere you can bind should have one of these
guys (or gals).  I play during off times due to my work hours and
have been stuck looking for a bind in NK for a fair stretch before
finally getting a bind or giving up and logging for the night.  At
my current level I never worry about it (my bind has been in FV for
many levels) due to that fact that I know many clerics, pay well for
rezzes, and try to be in a semi-balanced group (cleric sitting next
to me).  All that said I am happy for what was done and am sure my
baby warrior will take advantage of it.
