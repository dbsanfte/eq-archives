Well, I'm just a lowly 43 cleric, so still a newb to the ubers, but...
my thoughts.

If someone in zone is hollering for a rez, and my group is doing well
(my cleric only groups with guildies) usually one of the groupmates
will point out the OOC and suggest I send a /tell.  Group pauses for a
bit.
At that point, I'll send the guy a tell offering to res for a donation
- if he wants my puny 50% exp res.
If he asks how much of a donation, I suggest he pay what it is worth
to him.  That has got me anywhere from 5pp to 150pp.  Whatever they
pay, I /split with the group.  (and that reminds me, I forgot to do a
split last night!!!  Oops!)

Sometimes if I'm bored and not in a group, I will go to LoIO or FM
and:
/ooc Bored 43 cleric offering Resuscitate.  Donations desired, never
required. 
If someone asks how much, I again use the "whatever it is worth" line.
About half will donate nothing, but I'm a nice guy.  And when not in a
group, the mana *is* rather free.

Just my ramblings,
