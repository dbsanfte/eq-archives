I can't say that I have been going very fast, but what I can say is -
I didn't notice how long it's taking.... Level 35 _seemed_ longer to me,
because I am using 45 again to quest: Have just yesterday gotten
my 3rd Coldain Prayer Shawl :)

Here's a tip for good xp at 45, at least if soloing or in a duo:
Spectres in Oasis - I could clear the island solo and KEEP
it cleared.... But I have some cheap undead only spells.

Ulthorks in Eastern Wastes - Many Light Blues, but if you go
for the Warriors you're fine: They can be dropped easily,
they run slow, and they give decent xp AND loot...
Also kill the occasional Wooly Rhino

Frost Giants in Eastern Wastes: My favourite hunting spot
is neg 3000, pos 900, set up camp here and pull  to here.
Almost no pathing leads mobs exactly there (just the occasional
wolf or RyGorr Scout) but leads a LOT of mobs close.
It's just next to the RyGorr fort, btw. so if you feel bored....

Shardwurms in the Great Divide: They are tough because
hard to pull (I had a hard time when I had to pull myself),
but they are right outside Thurgadin (left side of river)
drop cool loot (White Scaled Tunic, 8AC, 3INT, 5 sv cold,
CASTER-Leather look!!) and give nice xp.


Just my way to beat it (4 blues from 46, finally)
