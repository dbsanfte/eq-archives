Neither. I'm fully aware that the game mechanics, and the rules set
forth by VI allow people to take advantage of newer or less informed
players all the time. But if I can help one to avoid those scumbags, I
certainly will. And you say nothing to discount what I said. The bazaar
has put and end to the majority of this shitheel behaviour, for anyone
willing to go there and learn how to use the interface to browse the
trader offerings.

I stand corrected. He's not being technically "dishonest" in terms of
the game mechanics or VI's PNP. What I should have said was immoral and
just a general shitheel. Thanks for straightening me out.

That's very true, Kaev. And a person who comes and keys your car while
you're asleep isn't 1/100th the scumbag somebody who burns your house
down while your sleeping is. Your point? Obviously you don't think that
the above example makes it "ok" to key cars. Same thing.

The phrase "trying to make a little extra PP in a trade" is yet another
lovely piece to throw in the arsenal of those trying not to say, "trying
to rip of newbiew or uninformed players for their own profit". I'll have
to safe that one for later rants. Thanks! :-)

Good title. I think, upon going back to re-read it, that I'll add it to
my EQ web page under that title! Something that well thought out,
lucidly explained, and so clearly useful to new players shouldn't be
left to simply fade into the giganews archives!
