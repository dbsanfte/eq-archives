Let me oblige with newsgroups that prefer top posting from my list:

alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.abit
alt.comp.periphs.videocards.ati
alt.internet.wireless
aus.ads.forsale.computers.new
aus.ads.forsale.computers.used
comp.networks
comp.os.-ms-windows.networking.windows
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.networking

oh and news.soundblaster.com - products.soundblaster.audigy


They all prefer top posting this is the only anal group I subscribe to.
