A guild called Iceni on my server, Innoruuk, is UK based and has been
elemental roughly a month or so.  I'm in a US guild, but I've got many
friends in Iceni and highly recommend them as a fun group dedicated to
progressing forward in the game.  Outside of all the spawns they steal from
us due to being hours ahead, they're a great guild ;-)
