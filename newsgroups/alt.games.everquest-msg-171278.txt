Hmmm, 3 Enchanters?  Why would that be a problem?  Their DoTs stack
(according to Lucy's parsing of the spdat anyway), they've got AE
stun from the start, AE mez from early on.  Charmed pets become
usable not too long into their careers...  Seems to me that three
Enchanters would do just fine.  As for three Warriors, they'd spend
most of the time down 50% health, but that's hardly insurmountable.
