do you know how many email accounts i have?

is it any business of yours if i post to a [for example] geek forum as 
cybrchik2003 to a fuzzy as bunyhugr and to alt sex whatever as 
seksychik0...all bogus examples by the way=) as you can see i have an 
earthlink account, which comes with 8 addresses. hot mail exists, as 
does [name]@justice.com or even [name]@findlaw.com [one that is long 
dead] for that matter, and many other free email account possibilities=) 
i think i even have a yahoo address because i am on a couple yahoo 
groups. if so i have never actually used it=\

ah, the infamous 'rialto' hm, i think i posted last to the rialto a few 
weeks ago, and before that on my old ISP about 8 months ago. I have a 
fairly lax posting history to the rialto, i am a lot more active in my 
own barony and kingdom. and i never claimed all, i said most...big 
difference.

aru
and my other interests? hm, in no particular order historical 
recreations, novaroma, SPQR, CDC issues [you should read morbidity and 
mortality weekly sometime, amazing data available] hazmat issues, health 
safety law, insurance law, science fiction of several different authors, 
steppes culture [hence the name aruvqan - a documentable female name for 
my sca persona] cooking of various eras and areas, the great barrier 
reef and i like some anime.
