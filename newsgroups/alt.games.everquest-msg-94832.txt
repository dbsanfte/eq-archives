Yes, I would agree with that point here.  Since not playing either a 
mage or a druid I wasn't going to comment here.  However, I agree.  If 
someone is AFK and accidentally gets aggroed on or their pet loses a 
fight and they die, then yes, their fault, risk of AFK fighting.  But, 
that is different from a druid quadding right over top of them, or Mr. 
Monk intentionally training somebody because they aren't sitting right 
there at the keyboard waiting to cast SOW on them.
