*** New Quest Paths ***



- New quests paths have been added to many of our outdoor zones. These 
quests can be completed by solo players or groups, providing fun and 
interesting quests to all players.

- Quest givers each have a series of quests, which in turn lead you to 
quests from their friends in the same zone.

- Even if some of the quests are below your current level, we encourage you 
to do them anyway. Not only do they still provide nice XP and monetary 
rewards, but some quest givers will see that you've helped their friends 
before and will offer you additional quests they might not otherwise give 
you.

- As you complete quests and gain levels, quest givers will let you know who 
to talk to next and tell you where they're located.

- Additional solo quest paths in higher-level zones will be added in future 
updates!

- Talk to the individuals below to get started on these quest paths. The 
quest starters are easy to find when you first enter a zone, and they will 
lead you to other quest givers when you're ready to help them.

- The Commonlands: Seek Mooshga at the Crossroads.

- Antonica: Find Matsy Rollingpin near the Sayer Outfitters.

- The Thundering Steppes: Look for Jacques as you enter from Antonica.

- Nektulos Forest: Mugwump is just across the bridge.

- The Enchanted Lands: Deputy Nettlebrine near the docks can help you.

- The Orcish Wastes: Mess Sergeant Akseltz has some tasks for you.





*** Offline Selling ***



- Characters can now list items for sale out that are located in their house 
vault. These items will remain for sale even when they leave their house or 
exit the game. You can now sell items while your character is offline!

- When you open your store by interacting with your Market Bulletin Board, 
your store window now shows the contents of your house vault in a separate 
tab. You can set prices for these items just as you would items in your 
inventory.

- While you are in your house and your store is open, items in your vault 
and items in your inventory that are flagged as being for sale will be 
listed on the city market. Other players can enter your home and buy items 
from your house vault and your inventory, just as they normally would.

- If your character logs out or leaves your house, items in the house vault 
tab of your store window will still be for sale. Items in your character's 
inventory will no longer be listed for sale on the market, but items flagged 
for sale in the house vault will be available for purchase through city 
brokers and fences. These items will show only the seller's name, not 
location, since the goods can only be purchased through the brokers.

- If goods in the house vault have sold while the seller was away, the Sales 
Log window will automatically open when the seller returns home to show any 
items that have been sold. All coin that has been earned will instantly be 
moved into the seller's inventory.

- Only one character per account can have items for sale at any one time. If 
you flag items in Character A's vault as being for sale, then log in 
Character B and flag items in its house vault for sale, items in Character 
A's vault will no longer be available for purchase.

- Items in the house vault will remain on the market 24 hours after the 
seller logs out, after which time the items will be taken off the market. 
When the seller logs in, the 24-hour timer will restart and the vault items 
will be listed for sale again automatically.

- As with your personal inventory, only items you flag as being for sale can 
be purchased by other players. You can continue to use your house vault for 
item storage if you wish.

- Only the owner of a house can sell items located in the house vault. 
Friends and trustees cannot access the house vault, although they can 
continue to sell items in their personal inventory while online.

- If the server is restarted for any reason, items marked for sale in your 
house vault will remain on the market (as long as you have been back to your 
home within the last 24 hours). There is no need to log your character back 
in after a server restart unless the 24-hour timer has expired.





*** Tradeskill Reaction Bonuses ***



- Beneficial events can now occur during crafting which will prove very 
useful for tradeskillers. There are three different events, each providing a 
handy bonus for the skilled artisan.



Technique Buff (Uncommon)

- Countering this event gives +150 progress and +150 durability to the item 
you're making. It also gives you a 5-minute buff that increases your 
crafting technique by 25.

- Benefit: This is very useful for crafters preparing for a tricky combine. 
For example, you may warm up by creating some components that trigger a 
Technique Buff, so that your final product will take advantage of this handy 
skill bonus.

- Failing to counter this event gives +150 progress and +150 durability to 
the item you're making.



Complete Efficiency (Rare)

- Countering this event will cause the item you're currently making to 
instantly become pristine by adding +1000 progress and +1000 durability. 
Note: In the next Live Update we will also add a secondary effect that 
causes no components to be consumed in the production of the item.

- Benefit: Think of this as being like a critical hit for tradeskillers. An 
instant pristine item!

- Failing to counter this event gives +350 progress and +350 durability to 
the item you're making.



Favor of Innovation (Extremely Rare)

- Countering this event will cause the item you're currently making to 
instantly become pristine by adding +1000 progress and +1000 durability. It 
also provides the crafter a rare harvested item appropriate to their level 
range and profession.

   - Alchemist: Precious Metal

   - Sage: Precious Metal

   - Carpenter: Wood

   - Provisioner: Root

   - Armorer: Ore

   - Tailor: Pelt

   - Weaponsmith: Ore

   - Jeweler: Precious Gem

   - Woodworker: Wood

- Benefit: Think of this event as the gods of Innovation bestowing favor 
upon you for your skill and ingenuity. Not only do you get a pristine item, 
but a valuable harvested component as well!

- Failing to counter this event gives +500 progress and +500 durability to 
the item you're making.





*** Live Event: The Plague ***



- Reports indicate that a mysterious ailment has begun infecting Norrath's 
citizens.

- According to our sources, both the Overlord and Antonia Bayle believe 
finding a cure for this plague to be the top priority of every citizen.

- Although the source of this disease remains unknown, it is believed that 
only the joint efforts of adventurers and artisans will be able to cure the 
people of Norrath.

- Opportunistic individuals may be trying to take advantage of the sick by 
offering supposed cures for sale at high prices. Beware: These salesmen are 
not licensed by the cities, and the effects of these remedies may not be 
what you expect.

- Inhabitants of both cities are discussing this plague and may offer 
theories and advice on both the cause and the cure. But until solid 
information is released by city officials, be dubious of such rumors.

- While the infection does not seem to be life-threatening at this point, 
the plague is highly contagious and has a visible effect on most everyone 
who encounters it. Traditional forms of medicine seem to offer temporary 
relief, but until a universal cure is found, reinfection is very likely.





*** The Bloodline Chronicles ***

- Creatures that spring from broken vases in the Tombs of Night and Dire 
Hollow are a bit tougher.

Nektulos again from people who have already completed their quests.

a Bloody Coup quests has been reduced.

- Blackmarrow will now drop loot in The Underrot Caverns: Moldy Crypt.

- A Piceous Gargoyle in The Underrot Caverns: Moldy Crypt should now pose 
more of a challenge.

- Mustcoat within The Underrot Caverns: Moldy Crypt will no longer be 
betrayed by its Sun Prowlers.

- Potions and elixirs found in the Tombs of Night and Crypt of T'Haen are 
now stackable.

- Quest Journal entries for the Missing Scouts and A Small Sampling quests 
now give more information on where the targets can be found.

- If the raid force perishes in the Release the Hounds event, the dogs 
should now wander the room rather then running back to their starting point.

- Exploration quest rewards in the Bloodline Chronicles no longer defray as 
much status costs for housing upkeep.





*** The Norrathian Express ***



- The Norrathian Express is pleased to announce that they have expanded 
their popular message delivery service! There are now mailboxes in all city 
zones as well as most outdoor adventure areas. Nothing will keep these brave 
couriers from their appointed rounds.
