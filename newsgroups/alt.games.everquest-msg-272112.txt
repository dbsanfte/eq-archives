Since they're no posts about it people haven't tried EQ2 after the
big patch. Gzzz what a mess SOE!! Why did put something up the so
obliviously bugged?

In case you don't know tradeskill instances are crashing, TS had
problems, my wizard's HO don't work (it refused to cast), cast one
spell and sometimes it makes another regen, hot key bars disappear when
you login, some chars are missing body part and weapons don't show etc
etc. Its like a beta not a finished product. So, why on earth did they
put up such a bugged version? No real need to it. Not like there were
major gaming killing bugs they needed to fix ASAP.
