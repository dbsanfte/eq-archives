  Right.

  But, as you pointed out, that wasn't all there was to it, so why are you
complaining again?

  I'll ignore the trollishness part of what you said and just say that you
have no way have knowing just how difficult or resource-intensive it was for
Verant to implement this feature, and it's been on a lot of peoples'
wishlists for a long time.  I personally think it's pretty cool.  Instead of
it just being a matter of breaking a camp and knocking down the mobs, maybe
this new feature will add a little spice and challenge in to otherwise
boring and routine gameplay.

  Nose ends...?
