EQ2 has it. And EQ has the largest world of any MMORPG out there now; its
absurd its the only one with no in game way to let players know at least
which continent they want to head for.

urm. Sure. Or because being able to sell automatically is useful, but so
is being able to buy; especially when tradeskilling. I'd much rather have
been able to leave myself bidding for acrylia blocks rather than constantly
checking for the bazaar when I was maxing fletching.

Also, because it, along with the bandolier, were specifically asked
for by players at the summit and on various forumns in light of the
increasing variety of clicky items and proccy weapons that we like
to swap around. Sort of.

For anyone with a proc weapon they like to switch in and out really; I
used to solo (as a ranger) when I played using a tash stick and a slowing
sword for tough mobs, both of which had *Awful* ratios. I also had a 
clickable cloak for self haste that only lasted 6 seconds, etc. These
would have been very handy.

That they're still putting useful things into EQ1? Well, its not enough
to get me to go back but Im not sure what the picture you're trying
to paint is... 'SOE hate the EQ1 player base so much they put features
in that look useful'? 

'SOE have no original ideas so they steal them from EQ2, made by ... SOE'?

It seems kinda... whiney to me ;) And I quit EQ ;) If they didnt make
any more improvements would you be posting to everything saying 'SOE
dont add stuff because they dont care' too? ;) Are Blizzard to be
condemned as rapacious whores for helping themselves to the enormous
back catalogue of previous RPG's, MUD's, MMORPG's, etc?
