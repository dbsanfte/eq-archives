Ok.  I have spent half of my day this saturday doing some detective work.  I
have discovered that the first memory module I had installed has a CAS
different from the second one.  PNY should come out and say who made their
memory.  They don't so I had to find out for myself based on the actual part
number on the chips.  I found out that SPECTEK made my PNY memory.  The PNY
memory module I installed has a CAS rating of 2.5.  So the two memory
modules are not EXCACTLY alike even though they are both PC2100 DDR Ram.  I
am going out today and get another PNY PC2100 RAM module and make sure that
it has the same chips installed  from SPECTEK before I buy it.

Hopefully this will correct my crashing problems.
