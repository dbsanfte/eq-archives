>Skill?  You call that skill?  

Yes, it takes "skill", or knowledge of how to play the game well, for
the cleric to know not to stand next to mezzed mobs when one is loose.
Alternatively he could clear his target so people could assist him and
find it. Regardless of the method, there were things that could have
been done to find the active mob, and now the change, like many of the
changes, removes the need to so people on the verge of stupidity are
less handicapped.

Take that far enough and the playing field is level for people of all
intelligence. That's great for the idiots and incompetants, not so
good for everyone else.

I never have any trouble knowing who I am attacking.

The very thing most incompetants would think. No offense.
