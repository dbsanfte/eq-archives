Nah, if you can invis, Firepots to Cabalis is the shortcut to take.
Nothing
I've found in Cabalis east or west sees invis, and the firepots drop you
off ritght at the zone line in to LOIO, in a spot with no guards or
wanderers
near enough to aggro.  Heck, even without Invis, with SOW you can
outrun the guards outside, make a quick left so as not to pick up any more
followers, and have lost the first two long before you hit the streambed.

Cabalis, of course, is one of the places where melee can get bound.

There are also two other ports in Kunark, people tend to think DL since
it used to be necessary to go there and then run to KC in order to evac...
but thats' been changed, evac to EJ and Skyfire both now can be done
from anywhere, instead of just from inside Kunark dungeons.   Its difficult

to reccommend the Skyfire port to anyone under 50, but the EJ one
is again doable with good geographic knowledge and invis or SOW
capability.  From EJ its a quick jog over to Field of Bone, where you
can get a bind outside Kaesora.

Dstep is quite correct in mentioning bind locations, it hardly matters
if the port spot is inches from where you will be fighting, if your port
spot is  several zones away from a bind then your real distance to
the fight is -twice- that far, unless you are grouped with a druid/wizard
who ports that you can rely on coming to get you (or with a cleric
you can rely on to res you...)  None of those options are likely  for
a 19 SK.
