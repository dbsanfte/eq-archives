That's been our experience as well -- we've lost a few
high-level characters to "raiding guilds".  But then they
all came back eventually.

Even I was thinking I'd have to "move on" when I hit 50,
even though I really didn't want to, but we
found a great solution.  There are many, many
smallish guilds that don't want to lose their "personality"
by becoming giant guilds, but want to do more "big raid"
stuff.  So our guild and four other guilds banded
together and formed a "raiding alliance".

Each guild appoints several "alliance officers", who all
meet twice a week at an appointed time (wednesday and
sunday) in a chat room to plan raid scheduled activities for 
the weekend.  Then each guild spreads the word via 
their /guildMoTD and the alliance website forums, and come 
raid time, 20-40 people of the appropriate level
generally show up, and we kick butt.

It has gone very smoothly so far, and now that people in
the alliance guilds have gotten to know each other,
it's very common for us to group with each other on an
informal basis during the week too, either for exp
groups, or "mini-raids" of one to two groups to
go after someone's quest mob.

Now that word has spread, many more guilds want to
join as well.  We're up to seven guilds currently.
Our only concern is that we not grow too fast.
