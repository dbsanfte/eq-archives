spend the money suscribing to alakazaam or another good eq site, and you can
find all the guilds on kazaa, just search under EQ.  beware though, there
are a few out there that tell you to send your login info in and somehow
your get free lvls or something like that, dont fall for it, i have seen the
same ad many times each with a different address and its a scam for sure. gl
