There was an offhand mention that if you play a song continuously, the
AE silence does not affect it. So one bard plays the cancel magic song
without twisting, which would kill the silence on the next pulse.

The drawback being that all player buffs are gradually stripped, of course,
but you could probably work around that by having all the casters in the
bard cancel area and all the melees just outside of it where their buffs
could stay. (But within range of the healers & buffers.)

This is pretty much speculation on my part, though, as I don't play a
bard and have not yet encountered an AE silence. Anybody more
knowledgeable, feel free to rip this strategy to shreds...
