Two things:
1) You need a router capable of NATing multiple routable IPs.  I don't 
think any of the turnkey (ie: linksys, d-link, etc) solutions provide 
this.  You're probably looking at setting up some kinda PC-based solution 
as your cheapest option.  Since you wouldn't really need a NAT in this 
case (ie: you will have a routable IP for each machine), you can probably 
just use a normal router.
2) You need to get multiple routable IPs provisioned by your ISP.  Most 
ISPs will probably tell you that you have to upgrade to a business 
account and buy a router from 'em.  You're looking at a big monthly 
increase as well as a big upfront cost here.
