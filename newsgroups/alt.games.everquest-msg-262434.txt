I agree completely here.  Before playing EQ I was a pretty 
hardcore UO
player, and that game (for me) was the grandfather of MMORPG's.  
I
played UO pretty faithfully up until the time I was accepted 
into EQ
Phase4 beta (still have the CD.. lol).  Anyone who was around 
especially
in the early days of UO know that trust was a huge thing in 
that game. 
It was a very brutal and unforgiving game in general, and dying 
meant
you pretty much lost everything unless you were with a good 
friend who
could grab your stuff before other players took it. 


Speaking of friends, one thing that UO and EQ both taught me is 
that
it's really all about the players - the relationships you make.  
I
played on Chessy shard in UO in a guild called the 
Dreamwalkers.  We
were  a 'good guy' guild for the most part and had fun at night 
hitting
the popular PK spots and hunting down PKs.  Many of my RL 
friends played
as well. Many moons later, probably 6 months prior to EQ's 
release not
only did many of my RL friends stop playing UO but also our 
guild began
falling apart as many people quit.  I found that once the 
players that I
came to love playing with left, I felt more and more like a 
dinosaur.  I
would stand around Brit bank or roam dungeons not knowing who 
the heck
all these strangers were.  Finally it got the point where I had 
no
reason to log in anymore because I didn't know anyone.  Sure, I 
probably
could have made an effort to join some new guild or meet new 
people but
I felt as if my time in that game were done. 

Anyhow, I think EQ will be the same way.  A long time ago it 
stopped
being about getting ahold of that next toy with more +HP/+mana 
and it
was more about the people I adventure with and overcoming new
challenges.  If all of those people stopped playing I don't 
think I
could continue playing either.
