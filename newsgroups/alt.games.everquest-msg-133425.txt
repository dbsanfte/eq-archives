To my knowledge you cannot make this in a meaningful way.

you could say

/say assisting %t on a %t.. only you would show the same
name twice (your current target, be it the guy you are supposed
to assist, or his target, or some other target you picked yourself
and the "assisting" part a total lie

Here's a hotkey that works

/target Joebob
/assist
/say assisting Joebob on his target, %t

Of course this doesn't let you use the message
for differing MA's.

There's also this one

/say assisting %t against his target
/assist
/say Die, foul %t, Die a lot!

you may need to insert a brief pause (say 3, which
is 3 tenths of a second) in order to have your second
%t refer to your new target instead of your original

If you give up feeling its necessary to announce -who-
you are assisting, you can simplify this and cut spam
by just using

/assist
/say Assisting on the %t

again a pause may be needed.

Personally I don't announce assists at all, even though
I tend to tank more than any six clerics I know.  My
assist key is no more complex than

/assist

because I need to use it for several different purposes,
I may not be attacking my new target at all, but assisting
MA/target/his victim... in order to see if its bashing on
someone other than the MA, and a heal may be in order.
Then its assist again and maybe now if the mob is visibly
on the MA I open up swinging for a while, occaisionally
checking up on mob target again just to be sure the MA
is still getting the love.

Similarly my bard doesn't have any announcements like
this, but its for a different reason; he's using all his hotkey
spaces for weapon slots and inventory slots!

My druid doesn't have any message for this either, but I
thats because he always either soloed, was PLed, or
duo'd with a very close friend who didn't have any need
to be informed as to what the silly little halfling was busying
himself with behind her back.
