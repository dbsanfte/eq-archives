Say goodbye to Ulthork Hide Tunic fun...

The second change is helpful once the first is done, but I
was under the impression that having a familiar was
supposed to have a risk factor...

So much for bypassing faction issues that way...

Gotta wonder what inspired that change.   I'm hoping it fixes
some of the nasty aggro bugs I've seen in certain zones due
to AoE bard songs, however.

Ah, more combat spam to deal with...

I guess listing them all is too much trouble...

So does this fix the ranger's stacking issues?  :)

That's gonna piss some people off...

Happy rogues...

I'd guess that'll affect some of the XP farming...

Wow...

Zlandicar might live a few minutes longer now.  I know of at
least one guild that has used that method of finding out if
he's spawned or not.

Again?  I don't remember them doing that...

Woohoo!

And increasing lag a bit more...

I guess they got tired of CS rezzes for the people falling to their
deaths at those portals...

All in all, a good patch, on paper, IMO.
