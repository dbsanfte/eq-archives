well yeah something like that.  What I use to be able to do was use
ctrl z and it would open both my inventory and a bag via hot buttons.
There was a link in a post on my guilds message board but with the
mess caused by the server mergers to zek and the latest patch I lost
the info.  my bud has cable versus my dial up so he brought over the
patch.  unfortunatly it had his ini's in it to so my client.ini got
overwritten. After that no more ctrl z. think sony may have gotten rid
of the way I use to do it.  Thanks again for the info
