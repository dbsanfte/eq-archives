I think you're hung up on the word "copy".  Intellectual property rights 
don't start and end simply with the right to copy a work.  There are other 
rights bundled into it.

As an example, I buy two copies of a children's picture book, pull out all 
the pages, and paste the pages in order on a big slab of plywood.  After I 
finish doing that, I paint a red border around the pasted pages and start 
hawking my creation to art galleries as a work of art.  I haven't copied 
anything, so presumably under your understanding, I haven't violated the 
author's copyright.  But I almost certainly have.  I say "almost certainly" 
because what defines whether my artwork is a copyright violation is whether 
it has any transformative value much greater than what I've appropriated 
from the original author.  I suppose there's a very slight possibility I 
could get a judge (and appellate judge) who would think that my choice of 
plywood (as opposed to slate, masonite, etc.), the painted red border on the 
work, and the concept of gluing pages of a children's book to a backing are 
sufficiently meritorious as to satisfy the notion of transformative value. 
I suppose I could also claim that I'm making a parody, but that would be a 
pretty weak case.

Also, imagine that I take the whole book and make a half hour cartoon 
special from it.  I haven't copied anything, but that would also be a 
copyright violation.  Most derivative works violate the original creator's 
copyright, even though they may not "copy" anything tangible.

I've also stated that the concept of misappropriation is the key issue in 
any case of SOE against companies like IGE.  Misappropriation is defined as 
"The unauthorized, improper, or unlawful use of funds or other property for 
purpose other than that for which intended....  Term may also embrace the 
taking and use of another's property for sole purpose of capitalizing 
unfairly on good will and reputation of property owner."  Essentially it 
allows SOE broad powers to determine how its property is to be used.  (Also, 
SOE's Customer Service being approached to resolve issues arising from the 
transfer of items in the game can implicate the definition of "capitalizing 
unfairly on [their] good will and reputation", since some of IGE's customers 
no doubt felt that SOE somehow bore responsibility for the screwup.)

Dark Tyger botches it when he cites some mystery "civil copyright laws", 
since misappropriation as a concept applying to intellectual property was 
established through case law.  Some relevant cases:

International News Service v. Associated Press 248 U.S. 215 (1918)  This 
case was overturned as federal common law, but most states have adopted its 
holding.

Metropolitan Opera Ass'n v. Wagner-Nichols Recorder Corp. 101 N.Y.S.2d 483 
(Sup. Ct. 1950), aff'd 107 N.Y.S.2d 795 (1st Dep't 1951)

Carpenter v. United States 484 U.S. 19 (1987)

Not that I expect you to be convinced.  You seem to be pretty entrenched in 
your thinking, and the idea that some guy on Usenet is gonna change your 
mind probably doesn't resonate that well.
