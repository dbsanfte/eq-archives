Indeed. Better yet, people that email it to themselves or some such 
silliness.

I keep all my passwords in an encrypted file.

On a floppy. In a locked drawer. And I only ever look at them on a little Linux laptop that has never been 
connected to the net.

I, personally, will never understand why people choose passwords like 
"password" or "sex". 

~Empty, sysadmin that sees this sort of thing all too frequently
