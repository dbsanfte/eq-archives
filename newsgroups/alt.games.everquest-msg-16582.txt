Scare an animal out of its mind? Force an animal to succumb to my

It's better than killing them for sport. And good druids cull out the
old and sick while preserving as much pelt and meat as possible.

The druid and ranger animal tricks come with understanding animals,
not through being treehuggers. We can fear and charm because we know
how animal minds work. Wolves and bears won't attack us because we
understand them so well they won't consider us prey or enemies unless
forced to do so - we know how to not appear threatening while any
class without these skills will automatically be perceived as
dangerous. They've been chosen to be protected, holy animals in the
Surefall area because of this extra understanding.
