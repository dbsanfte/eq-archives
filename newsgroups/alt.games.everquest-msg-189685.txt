I think the main problem I have with AO is there's hardly any class
interdependance.  You don't need a doctor, beurocrat, etc to do areas,
any class can heal through the use of meds, etc.  - of course some times
this feels more like a bonus, and there's only 4 (sort of) races which
really aren't all that different.

My next problem with it is the skill system.  I don't like having to
divide my points up.  I much prefer EQ in this respect.

All the content blends togeather, one mission isn't much different from
the next (actually that's kind of the same problem I have with the
characters). 

Implants are a major pain in the ass to deal with.  You have to spend a
large portion of your time tweaking them if you want to get anywhere. 
It was a cool idea but poorly executed IMHO.

Other than all that it's a very good game, and I'd recommend trying it
for a couple months to anyone.  Definately my first choice for a break
from EQ yet still remaining in the MMORPG.

A few more things: they built in running it in a window from the start,
another thing EQ stole from it.   The messaging system is much much
better, EQ is starting to get there, but not quite yet.  The interface,
hot keys, and the equivelent of spell gems are much more customizable,
with no 8 "spell" limit.  They had something similar to 'realms' way
before DAOC came out as well.

And of course it is the best SCI-FI MMORGP, really the only one worth a
darn.

They also have a free 30 day trial if anyone is interested in trying it.

Endless tradeskilling (actually it sounds like that's about all the game
is going to be), Jedi really screwed up - really the only "class" one
can fight with, yet you cannot choose to be one, you just have to luck
into it in some undefined maner.  Skill tree system (which I don't
like).  No space combat (c'mon, that's half the movies!).  Can't play a
'droid.

*Spew*  EQ2 not a class/level based system from what I'm hearing.  EQ is
the only MMORGP on the market right now that is, and is one of it's
strengths. That's enough for me.

I was really looking forward to playing this before it came out, but
after reading the reviews it looks possibly worse than jumpgate.

EQ had a lot more depth when it came out than any of the other MMORGPs
on the market... even now.  I'd dare say it is more varied in locals,
combat techniques, quests, classes, tradeskilling when all put togeather
than most single player RPGs.

FYI these are the MM games I've played in order:

UO - Shallow content, Griefers everywhere, really turned me off of PvP.
Quit before EQ came out, took a lot to get me to try another MM

EQ - Best so far, could use a graphics engine update at this time.

Jumpgate - More of a trade/space combat game, travel is too slow,
reminds me of EQ early days.  Not much to do after you become a
mulitbillionare.

AO - Very Innovative, good features even EQ still doesn't have, needs
more content.

Toontown - Childs game (supposedly) suprisingly good, but unsure how the
MM content will work very well at higher levels with children, also not
very much content, best "quest" system so far IMHO.
