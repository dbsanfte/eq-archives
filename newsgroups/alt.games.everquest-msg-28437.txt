I just have 1 question:
If there was a D2 like system, would it not be HELL to need to run for example
from IllOmen to DL druid ring to port, instead of getting a nearby druid/wizard
to port you?
Or how about getting away from Arena (the zone, not the ones in cities) after a
guild event? Nearest druid ring are Feerott, which cannot be reached by good
races unless they are REAL careful or in wolf form (and then youll need a druid
again to wolf form people). Other nearby ring are in NK, a damn long run.
