Not going to quote much of the other 40+ posts as I think its been done quite
enough.  In general, if someone is camping a particular NPC and has stated so
through ooc/shout, then I will pretty much leave it alone, but if a person
claims they are camping an entire group of NPC's or an area, then I will assume
he is a moron and go by the first-hit rule.  

As for the incident regarding Hadden, it was brought up that the guy who popped
in 10 min before was in the wrong to take from the guy who had been there for
four hours, while this is in a way true, there is no way of knowing that he had
been there that long at all and could be lying about the time he had spent
there at the camp.

It is interesting though, that some of the same posters on this topic that are
claiming that Verant's policy on first hit should be overlooked and/or ignored
are some of the same posters that felt Verant's policy of character naming
should be followed to the letter with no exception.  Amazing how the situation
can lead to a different view on Verant's rules.
