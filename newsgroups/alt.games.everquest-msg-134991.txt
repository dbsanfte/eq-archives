During my time away from EQ, I started playing WWII Online.  While the
launch of that game was a disaster of epic proportions, it is slowy evolving
into a very nice game.  Some of the early patches were 90MB+.  When you
first installed the game, you immediately had to download one that size just
to get it to work.   Of course, the player base is only a tiny percentage of
what EQ's is, so that helps the bandwidth, but 90mb is still 90mb.

Its funny that I was so used to the problems that patches caused with
WWIIOL, that now that I'm back with EQ (and still with WWIIOL), I had the
feeiling that it would be much easier with Verant and SOE.  Heh heh,  guess
even the pros still have problems.
