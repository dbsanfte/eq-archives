Greetings,
I've got a 48 iksar necro who's looking for a place to get some exp.  Here's
what i'm looking for:

1. It can be a camp of a single mob (I'd almost prefer this if it's a 6 min
spawn)
2. It should be dk blue to lvl 48
3. It can't hurt faction with Cablis, Dark Elves, Freeport Militia, or
Paineel.
4. I'd prefer it if it wasn't a highly contested camp.
5. I'd love it if it wasn't a lot of wandering mobs
6. I've got all the expansions, so it can be virtually anywhere

I camped the paladin in wfp arena from 45 to 48 and now he's light blue and
i'm out of ideas. (But it did get me dubious to militia eventually =).

Any opinions?

Thanks,
Dea
