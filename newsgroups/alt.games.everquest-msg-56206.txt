What are you trying to create a Tanking Druid? Try going for WIS Items
Uthkor Tunic 300-500p, Arms 150p (Man-o-Wars Eastern Wastelands) Othmar Caps
400p (Tailor Made) Mammoth Hide cloaks (Ice Goblin Alchemist in Permafrost),
Gatorscale leggings (Aceint Crock Upper Guk), and such. Don't worry about
the AC go for WIS. If you are not useing Snare, dot, and root tactics your
playing the class worng. Druids will never last standing toe to toe.
