I am presently bow kiting young kodiaks, lions, beetles and spiders in
EC quite easily. Just snare them and start plinking away. I throw in
Flame Lick for good measure. Now my ranger is a level 13 with an
archery skill nearing 60, and it has really gone fairly well.
Depending on how high into the teens you are, you may need to venture
into WC and look for higher young kodiaks or full grown kodiaks.

I *do* occasionally sit and pincushion others' Orcs from afar at Orc 1
camp as well. I never had anyone complain, though I normally get their
permission first.
