  You may not care about the expansion, but if you were level 50+ and had
already seen most of what the other continents had to offer, I'm sure you
would be praising the addition of more zones, more mobs, more loot, more
skills, more spells, more quests and new features in general.  If they
didn't add content to the game, players would get bored and leave.  The only
way to add content is to occasionally take the game down for extended
periods of time.  It's not fun, but it's a minor, temporary annoyance.  Suck
it up and enjoy the game when you can.
