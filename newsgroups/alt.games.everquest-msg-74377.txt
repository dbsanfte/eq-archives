While I certainly can't answer this in detail from experience, I can
at least offer a starting point to work from: Vampires.

Been hunting the vampires in Tenebrous Mountains, and I get bonus
to two Katta factions each time I kill one, have gone from dubious
to indifferent there in a little over a day.  Further, save up the
fangs, once you get to where you can hand them in, you get a much
larger pile of faction hits by giving them four at a time to Kroldar
Strongarm, the warrior trainer, at +142 -2088 +73

I hear there are also quests for the blood and the ashes the
vampires drop.  Fighting at the castle, the vamps are blue to me at 54,
and the named ones seem to have drops that are worth getting,
in particular I got a belt that is +6 wis and +6 int along with a host
of other stats, all all.  Point being, exp, faction, cash, and
usuable/sellable
loot all in one package... and the prey is Undead, oh, and its outdoors
so my Tboots work, as would SOW and likely Harmony if you had
a druid/ranger handy.

One happy cleric
