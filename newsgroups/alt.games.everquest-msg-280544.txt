This guy posts to alt.games.warcraft too (using the same email address:
eqtotalsecrets).  The funny thing is that he doesn't know too much
about pay to access web services and the files were stored on a website
which was accessable by all.

Someone posted the link last week and so I downloaded all his money
making and power-levelling guides.  I'm sure its of no surprise to
anyone here but:  They suck!

The powerlevelling guides are titled for example "Warrior Powerleveling
Guide Levels 1-20".  For one thing, this is WoW, my Grandma could
"power-level" to 20 in a week.  Another thing is he only actually gives
instructions to get to 15.  The details he gives have less info than
you'd find out going through the tutorial-like quests.  When you remove
all the info which is describing the abilities you'll get at level x
(which is wrong for at least one of the guides) his power level guide
is basically kill stuff.

His money-making guide is basically kill stuff, loot and sell.  He does
point out some creatures that give good loot but I'm not sure that the
ones he mentioned are any better than any mob of the same level.
