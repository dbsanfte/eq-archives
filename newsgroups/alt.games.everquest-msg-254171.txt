In theory, yes.  But in reality it doesn't come up often enough to be an
issue.  Aside from the endurance cost, you can only activate it once every
40-50 minutes.   So it's usually saved for either named mobs or emergencies.
If it's a named mob that needs it... well, it's going to be more important
to get that thing slow before the discipline runs out than to squeeze out
every last bit of extra damage.
