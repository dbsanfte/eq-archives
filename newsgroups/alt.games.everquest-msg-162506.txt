Hello all, 
I just built a new pc;
AMD 1800 XP.
Radeon 7000.
Sound Blaster Audigy Xgamer.
256mb DDR (will be upgrade to 1gig this weekened)
40gig WD HD.
Windows XP Home.
I cant off the top of my head remeber the name of the MB. It does
however use the VIA chipset and is a well known brand. I know, I
should be shot for not knowing, I built the damn thing.
The only issue my PC has is the I cannot find a way to disable the
onboard audio card in the bios. I have it disabled in windows, and my
SB working with no issues. And I appear not to have any IRQ conflicts
anywhere, not sure that would cause the problem anyway.


Ok, the problem I am haveing is that in game the ground "shakes" when
I move my toon. Also, when I look down I sometimes see through the
ground (and under the ground is usually the sky. Weird, but true). If
I am looting a mob and happen to look through the ground, I get mass
graphic corruption untill I look up. Makes looting a pain sometimes.
However, it will not corrupt the box that pops up that has the mobs
inventory.

Here is what I have done/tried/etc,
Installed the latest VIA 4 in 1 drivers.
Installed the latest Driver for my video card.
I do not have texture caching on, I never have.
Checked the Knowledge bases for ATI and Everquest for the problem.
Could not find 1 other person with the problem.
Did a search in this newsgroup. No information found.
Did a search Usenet wide. No information found.

So fellow Everquesters, I come to you in humble humility and ask for
your assitance. I do not know what to do next and ANY advice pointing
me in the right direction, other than "BUY YOURSELF ANOTHER PC YOU
DIMWIT< I USE A COMPAQ AND IT ROXORS!!!". Will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
