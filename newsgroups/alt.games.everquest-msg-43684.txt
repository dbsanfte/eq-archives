Another thought on this, which I hope the developers of DAoC and EQ will
both take into consideration, is about the full screen vs. half screen
thing. I'm one of the few people left, I believe, that still plays in
half screen. The reason is that I'm blue-green colorblind, and yes, I
know I represent a  very small minority of the players.  There was some
talke about EQ being full screen only after Luclin comes out, and I sure
hope they don't do that. I've never been able to find a combination of
colors that allows me to read the text scroll against various
backgrounds. And if you make the whole chat box background opaque,
you've just wiped out a big piece of your field of view which can be a
lethal hindrance in some zones. I only switch to full screen to take
screen shots.
  In DAoC I didn't see any means of switching out of full screen mode to
something where I could read the text better, even if on a smaller
screen. I hope they consider this as an option as they continue to
re-tool it through the beta phase.
