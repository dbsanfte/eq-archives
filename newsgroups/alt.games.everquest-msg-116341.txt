Randoming gets unfair?  While there -are- some objections to random,
you certainly can't say its unfair.  Fair is its best feature, followed by
fast.

If you run things via NBG then you are being unfair to people who
could certainly sell the Phat Lewt in order to buy things they -do-
need.  While this is generally looked down upon, you can't claim
that its "fair" to deny loot to people who were at the raid and can
make use of it in some way.

Seniority is also inherantly unfair; the people who have benefitted
the most from the guild (because they've been there the longest,
and presumably the guild is doing things that benefit them or they
would have left long since) continue to benefit the most, and the
newer members who may have the most "need" for the items
get nothing but the leavings.  While there are strong arguements
in favor of this policy, it can't be said that its "fair"

Fairness is often overrated, mind you... but that doesn't mean
you can take the most fair system and say that it isn't fair.
