I think a game has actually done that, let you use a credit card for
more phat lewt.

I think the premium price is really a better idea. I'm betting SWG
starts at a premium price of say $19.99 per month, which would still
get it roughly 700,000 subscribers easily. A regret of verant has long
been the $9.89 rate they started with leaving them little to work
with.
