I'm a coldain thru and thru, I moved to Thurgadin and got a bind there at level
two, leveled 2 thru 6 on snow bunnies before being forced to seek greener
pastures... or should I say Non green pastures :)

My distaste for killing CoV dragons, though, is less strong, more practical in
nature.  I like being able to roam Skyshrine freely, get port to WL without
thinking, travel WW in relative safety.  Plus, killing Giants (my sworn enemy)
gives me positive faction... well isn't the enemy of my enemy my (ally)?

Well, when a dragon has to die, heck, I'm all for it.  But then I put my faction
back.  Funniest thing was my drop from killing Aary was repaired the very next
day by killing Zlandicar!  Too bad he's not up more often, thats one dragon I'm
more than happy to kill as often as you like.

I was amused, recently, to see that supposedly Coldain and CoV are enemies... is
it really possible to be Ally to one and worst enemy with the other?

My Bard is eager indeed to start killing dragons, since he's busily trying to
stay at least dubious with both Coldain and Giants... killed whisperwing for the
key a couple days ago and got plus faction giants, neg faction CoV... and no
damage to Coldain!  Plus this is a hunting zone I denied myself as a cleric, so
it will be fun to have a whole new place to work in.

ps no coldain skin either.  Ick.
