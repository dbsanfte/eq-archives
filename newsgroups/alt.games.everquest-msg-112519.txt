LOL, the perfect pelts are used to make the rallic pack,  an 85% weight
reduction 10 Slot pack.  You need to get a pattern from Rallic in Katta in
order to make it.  It's a sweet pack to have but I noticed yesterday that
it's Lore and Nodrop.  The pattern is lore too but it's not Nodrop.  I'd
just die if I found out a friend sold perfect pelts to a vendor.
