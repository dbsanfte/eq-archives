I found this funny because businesses here have been sued successfully about
smoking in exactly the situation you have been describing, and now, despite
all the standards of acceptable behaviour the managements of pubs and clubs
have defined, it looks like smoking will be shut down inside them. What
something *is*, is decided by consensus, not property rights.

Locally, James Hardy enterprises (which dealt in asbestos and building)
defined asbestos as not being dangerous. Sure, people died of what non JH
staff said was asbestos related diseases, but JH (according to this
reasoning) could have simply pointed to a clause in their contract which
said "disease, by definition, is not related to asbestos".

JH played a shell game with my gov't, transferring assets overseas, then
when the cases started rolling in, they said the cupboard was bare. The
gov't said that it didn't care how JH defined things, it was going to pay.

Kill stealing is the same thing. It is a concept that exists outside in the
community, and it cannot be owned or redefined by anything less. It's a form
of harassment. Would the company that manages the game be legally liable if
it didn't act to prevent harassment? Perhaps not now (the law always seems
to be 20 years behind the technological changes) but I expect it will be,
and since laws can be retrospective, that's something they should be taking
into consideration.

To use the pub analogy, if a patron was following me around drinking my
drinks, and that pub had bouncers, and i complained about it to the pub
staff and they refused to take action because they had redefined theft as
"something that occurs to people not inside our premises", then i think i
would have a pretty strong case legally.
