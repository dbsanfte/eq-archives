Powerleveling is exactly what it sounds like. Optimizing your leveling by 
going to the places that provide the fastest, most consistent experience.

You can go about it in several ways. The most common is to use a high 
level druid/shaman on a second account to twink the low character (give 
them high level equipment/money) and then buff them to the hilt with 
damage shields, HP/AC buffs, stat buffs, etc. Then you go to an area with 
MOBs that are about 5 to 10 levels higher than the character you are 
Powerleveling and they just start to wack on everything in sight. The 
MOBs kill themselves on the damage shields and as long as you have done 
at least 1 point of damage you get the experience for the kill. You do 
this all the while the druid/shaman is healing you when necessary.
