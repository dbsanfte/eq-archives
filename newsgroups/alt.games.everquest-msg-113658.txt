Hi, and congrats on the choice of an Iksar Monk!

Best dite out there for monks is:

www.monkly-business.com

All the relevant info is there.

As for fist damage- yes both dmg and delay change by level (1-5, 6-10,
11-15... I think), we iksar get a higher delay than hmabns at higher levels,
only by 1 pt though.

Weight is critical for Monks, but that changes with level too. Keep your
weight below 14st and you are fine, this increases slightly at higher
levels.
Most monks turn off, (and wont group with) Loot Autosplit. Too many damn
coppers.
For levels up to about 20th, the weight doesn't make too great a difference.
If you are in a group and not acting as the tank, weight becomes nearly
irrelevant until mid levels. For soloing, or acting as the tank, keep the
weight down, unless you are hunting greens for cash/silk/specific stuff on
Kunark. (LoIO cats for pelts, for example)

Hope this helps,

Enjoy!
