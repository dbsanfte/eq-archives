Please refrain from using all your links to the autoinsult generators on the
first day...save some for later so you don't run out of material and are
spotted hiding in a corner stuttering over your own name.

So Rammer...do YOU play Everquest or did you just come over here from FAnG
because you think you're cool and you can run back there afterwards and get
some really cool attention from your other idiotic compatriots?

If you're going to flame people...at least be smart enough to stick to the
topic and use Everquest as the theme...
