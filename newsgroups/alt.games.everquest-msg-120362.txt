Which do you think does more damage, considering both
players have their epic?   A mage or beastlord pet?

It'll help them but no where near actually making them a desired
class, IMO.   There's a maximum of four pets on one mob at once
(which isn't likely to change) and other melee classes (monks and
rogues) are still going to do more damage and have the advantage
of being player controlled.  What this will do, in the high-end game,
is give mod rod and CotH mages something more to help out.

That ability isn't limited to enchanter pets so it's just as true for
any pet class.  I'd say it's a wash.  In fact, enchanters now have
to go get beat on *again* to get their pet to attack, right?   At
least before they could have the pet on one mob, pull another,
mez the second, and have the pet attack it as soon as the first
one died.  That's no longer true so I'd say it's actually a
disadvantage (unless they snuck in real pet commands for
enchanters...)
