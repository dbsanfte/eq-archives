The 2h weapon bonus's scale up with higher delay. The lower delay
weapons generally perform worse, despite hitting more frequently, because
the bonus that is applied more often is still sufficiently reduced to 
do less total damage than the slower weapons higher bonus.

With higher attack, however, the damage bonus's begin to be less important,
as you hit nearer your max hit more frequently - they become a lower 
percentage of your total damage done.

Lets say you have a weapon that has a max hit of 100, min hit of 1, and
a damage bonus of 50.

With 0 ATK hitting minimum each time you hit for 1 + 50 ; the damage
bonus is 98% of your damage.

Now, with  7894632 ATK (you have a really *really* uber augment ;) ) you
hit each time for 100 + 50 ; max hit every time, woohoo!

But the damage bonus is now 33% of your damage, far less significant.

These figures are of course, total bunk, but they illustrate the point; the
higher attack figures help shift the vital weapon attribute from bonus towards
ratio.

That said, WMBS and windblade are still pretty close in DPS. If you're buying
a windblade *anyway* to reduce ripostes, theres little point in getting
the WMBS as well.
