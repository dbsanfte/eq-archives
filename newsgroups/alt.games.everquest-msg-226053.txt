We did two collects in Mistmoore last night - 22 vampire fangs and 25 red
ash.  We got a success on the 22 fangs despite the fact that 4 out of 6 of
the group went LD for 40 minutes.  We got done the red ash collect with 20
minutes to spare, which actually felt like we were underperforming
considering how easy our recent collects have been.
