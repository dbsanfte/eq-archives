This is probably obvious to everyone else but not to me. I have loaded the
EQ atlas skin which turns the less than useful help file in to a in game
atlas very useful (available at EQATLAS.com )for those of you like me with
no sense of direction. But my point is I also have a new player interface,
each time I load one it replaces the other. The eqatlas specifically
requests it is set up in her own folder with all the maps i want to use, I
wondered if I put all my skins in one new folder if that would work.

I have never dabbled with skins b4 but seeing this post decided to try it
and I love it. Getting all the maps I need downloaded now but there is one
thing I would like which is the ability to browse tradeskill site while
still in EQ is there such a skin? or as a compromise is there any utilities
out there to turn a webpage into a jpg image?
TIA.
