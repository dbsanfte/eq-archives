For Vox, you pretty much have to sieve her, since there is no way to get her
to spend mana without losing raid members.

For Gore though, the much better method (which Martin mentioned) is to have
a bard kite her around for a good 10 to 15 minutes.  Don't bring her in to
kill while she still has enough mana left to CH.  And really, when is the
last time you had a shortage of bards willing to kill Gorenaire? ; )
