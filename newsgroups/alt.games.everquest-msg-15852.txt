You'll need to remember where your guild hall is in your starting city.
I don't play a rogue, so I don't know where they are, but
http://www.eqatlas.com will get you started. Once you find your guild
hall, right click on the NPC's there, and one of them will be a trainer.
You can select which skill(s) you want to practice, and use your points
accordingly. There's alot of good info at
http://everquest.allakhazam.com and http://eq.castersrealm.com. Both of
those sites should give you alot of insight into things you can/should
do while playing a rogue.

Hope this helps!

Brent
