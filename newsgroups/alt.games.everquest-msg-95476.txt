Amen brother.

As one 35 half-elf bard, to another:  Where are you hunting?  Grouping
or soloing?  

I'm having a tough time figuring out where to be, and getting groups
in OT as the 'mana pumper' leaves me bored to tears...  And solo'ing
there (charm/fear-kiting as appropriate) often has me running to zone
with my lambent skirts held up like a school girl.  

Heck, I don't even like OT, but wandered over there this weekend.  Had
a great time in Marus Seru, but it pretty much greened out on me.
