/sigh
If my premise that the Creator transcends time is true then we aren't
"created anew as we are regarded by the creator", because from the
Creator's perspective creating and regarding us occur together outside
of time.  That is, we are Created (with free will) and our existence
is known (including all of the choices we make) in a single timeless
moment (from the Creator's perspective).  Now, I don't know this to
be true, I do not claim to know the mind and nature of God.  It is,
however, a possibility that refutes the certainty of predeterminism.
