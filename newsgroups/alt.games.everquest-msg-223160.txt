As several people have said before, Giving a weapon to your pet does still
affect the damage output. Your pet will hit for either its native damage, or
double the damage of the weapon.  At level 29 your pet gets dual wield, but
requires two weapons in order to use this ability.  The next pet, level 34,
will dual wield with just its bare hands.  Around 29 it also becomes
difficult to find cheap weapons to hand to your pet that are going to make
it do more damage, so once you reach the 34 pet there is really no reason to
give your pet weapons unless they have a proc, such as gnoll hide lariats,
velium weapons, or mage summoned weapons.  At level 44 your pet begins to
proc a lifetap of his own.  As for backstabs, only the 53 and 63 pets
backstab.  The 56 pet is a monk and will kick for 71 damage.

Hope you enjoy playing your necromancer; I know I certainly love mine.Even
if you don't play your necromancer for very long, trying out new classes can
give you a greater appreciation for what every class is capable of.  I have
certainly learned a great deal from playing my current cleric alt, and no
doubt will from the beastlord I have recently started.
