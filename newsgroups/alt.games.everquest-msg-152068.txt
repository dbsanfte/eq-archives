Yeah it sometimes servers a "poor mans" port if you cant get a Translocate
to Bind. Put yer stuff in the bank, and get someone to duel you. No xp loss,
and probably a bank close to your bind (specially cause non-caster types
dont have gate/bind, and have limited bind points.).

I was always leary about dueling untill I understood you can't loot corpses
or lose xp, atleast on a blue server.

Watchout though, some ppl (like Freeport gaurds) will aggro you if you fight
close to them, and that death IIRC, will result in loss of xp.
