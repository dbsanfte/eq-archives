History is written by the winners.  The losers tend to be defined as
evil. If you had asked anyone in Japan from the forties through the
sixties (and quite a few to this day, I'd wager) they would tell you
that the United States was chock full of right evil bastards.

As has been pointed out, Good and Evil are purely relative labels. Ditto
for Right and Wrong, et. al.
