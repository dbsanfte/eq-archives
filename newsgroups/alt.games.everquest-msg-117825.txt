Now, I may be entirely strange, but does anyone else wonder if it might not
be better - or at least more useful - to have experience display in numeric
form rather than the blue and orange bars we currently enjoy?

For example, I am failing to make any progress through my current level -
I've hit that point that persuaded me to chuck EQ the last time.  That
certain point that everyone else seems to sail through with ease but which
for me is like a brick wall - and a thick, very high one at that.

The point I'm talking about is called Level 10 (believe it or believe it
not) - when blue creatures give no experience at all (not so much as a
pixel, I swear), white monsters are nowhere to be found, yellow and red are
invincible as always.  I know what you're going to say:  GROUP!  Well,
that's as maybe but when you only usually get to play a half hour at a time
it's not that practical.  So I resigned myself to levelling slowly, but this
is just ludicrous.

I always look at the exp bar and wish it would actually TELL me how much I'm
earning per critter, and how much I need.  And it's not as if realism's a
problem - I dunno about you, but in RL I don't have orange bars telling me
how good I am at something.  I mean, if you're going to make a game where
statistics are all-important, why not have them in number form?  When I've
got 85,000 XP to go, why not TELL me so?  When I look to see how good I am
at something, why not say "Your current skill level in Archery is 43/250"
(or whatever the max is), instead of "Archery:  Poor"?

I think it'd make things far more accessible.  But then, like I say, I'm
probably just strange.
