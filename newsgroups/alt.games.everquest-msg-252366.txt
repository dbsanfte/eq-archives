My point is, the question isn't properly "does someone who is running a 
legit operation deserve...", since the people in question are not doing so.

So is it ok to rob, cheat, kill those crack dealers?  Or do they have to 
be dealt with within the legal system?  I'm not pushing an answer here, 
mind you, personally I come down on the "no its not ok to do illegal 
things to people even if they are also doing something illegal" side, 
but I can certainly see the flip side of the arguement, and on an 
emotional level often side with it, even though logic dictates that the 
rule of law will be destroyed by such vigilantiism.

Splendid
