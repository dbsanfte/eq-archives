all I have to do is wait my turn to kill him in skyfire. To get Imbue Fire
Opal ask a Cleric who has completed his Epic. I was told most will by
several extras I know I got 12 before turning in the pearl. Yes I have
several characters over level 10 including a 39 Wizard. Infact if I were
inclined to create a new character I would have to delete a 22 Enchanter or
maybe a 25 Mage as they are my lowest.
