I'm prepared to hate myself for this, in case you spent most of your
career in Lake of Ill Manner, OT and DL, but it looks like your next
step if you simply can't get a guild or a regular group to go someplace
decent, would be either the train infested hell of Karnor's Castle, or
the latest darling spot for similar players, Velks entry and "shallow"
camps.

The good places you could go will all require either keys that you will
need friends to help get, or pre-made groups.

/em shudders at the possibility of sending another three zoner into
those places.

/em apologizes heartily if this doesn't apply to you.
