I find it better when there are a few people sharing the zone with me,
becasue the more stuff that gets harvested, the more nodes that pop
up, on (I think) a 1 for basis (but not 1 type for one type).

The biggest problem is no-one wants the cooking nodes, so they get
left while everyone looks for metal, hides and wood.  So it gets to a
point when all you can see is Wild Garden, and you have to harvest
them just to get some new nodes popping up.

I've had some late night sessions, and Runnyeye is fantastic at 2-4am,
as I usually have an Oakmyst instance to myself (sometime sharing with
1 or 2 other people).

I've fiund that my Gathering is FAR ahead of all other skills (IRC
it's around 67 no, compared to high 30s for mining and forestry, and
26 for trapping).  Frustrating, as I was in Antonica earler, and saw
dozens of nodes with no-one nearby.  Alas, all I could harvest were
the bushed for, yes, worthless cooking materials (which I had to
gather, as I needed 15 tubers for a wholesalers quest).

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
