While I don't know the exact formula... Verant loves to keep information like
this secret, in the mistaken impression that it adds "mystery" to the game...
this is not true.

I'm not sure what the ratio is, but backstab damage increases as the skill
increases.   When my rogue increases her backstab skill, she will sometimes
start backstabbing for 1 more max damage.    Only when her skill increases
though.   Same weapon, same character level, same type of enemies, sometimes
even on the very next backstab on the same mob, if she max hits on the skill
increase and the next attempt.
