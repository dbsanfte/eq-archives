Well, you've effectively hamstrung yourself there. You mention needing
to find somebody to group with, so I assume you don't have a pre-made
BYOG to travel with. If you had, then there are *lots* of zones at 19
where you could go level, albeit with slightly slower xp and somewhat
poorer loot. Example: Rathe Mountains is a *totally* underutilized zone!
It's only used by the 30 and up crowd farming the HGs for cash.  But
it's a gigantic zone with mobs of widely varying levels scattered
around. You could probably go from five to fifty there without ever
leaving if you had a group ready to go all the time. But you apparently
don't, and we all know how well you'll solo your warrior. :-/
  So, I'm afraid you're stuck in populated zones if you have to find
partners. I still think Highpass and High Keep are your best bet. Your
other choice is the Karanas. More dangerous, IMO, and more complicated
hunting, but slightly better chance of finding a group.
  You could try a couple dungeons and see if anyone else is around you
could team up with, but it's far from a sure thing. Najena comes to mind
as being a goldmine at your level if you can hook up with anyone else.
