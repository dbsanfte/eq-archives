What bothers me is that Verant is almost always WRONG when they say it's my
ISP.  It very well may not be THEIRS but my ISP doesn't go all the way to
San Diego in the exact same way THEIR ISP doesn't STOP in San Diego.  We
connect to the internet cloud.  They connect to the internet cloud.  It is
no more my ISP's "problem" what happens in that cloud than it is theirs.
They are being misleading when they blame my ISP.  A much more intelligent
answer would be "we aren't experiencing any internet difficulty in this
area.  Please check with your ISP to see if they know of an internet problem
anywhere."
