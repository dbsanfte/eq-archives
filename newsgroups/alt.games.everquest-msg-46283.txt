Agree. For the last fifteen levels or so I've been grouped almost
continually with a rogue as our damage dealer. Just me and him doing
damage in a three person group for a great majority of the time.
However, I'll often log on before him, and have to spend some time
killing stuff with just me and the cleric. I can tell you, with 100%
confidence, that the rogue outdamages me by a *very* significant margin.
I see it in the time (average) it takes to kill a given type of mob, and
how much mana the cleric has to use per fight, with and without the
rogue. It's not even close.
  When I pull, I generally have to stand there toe to toe with the mob,
out in the field, until I can get three or four taunts and a lot of
slashes in just to build up enough hate so it won't jump the rogue in
the first five seconds. Fortunately, between judicous use of special
attacks, and evade, he's a master of aggro management and rarely turns
into a mana sponge for the healer.

But yes, in conclusion, the rogue is a feaking whirlwind of steel
compared to me. Easily a two to one ratio. Sometimes worse.
