Thanks for the advice.  I've already applied every single patch and update
to remedy this issue but still no joy.  When I did Sony's online tech
support (chat based, but what the Hell....) they already grilled me on all
that stuff.  Evidently telling them you already did it wasn't good enough
for them.  Oh well, that's basic tech support for most companies now
anyway-make the customer feel like they are the culprit.  They e-mailed me
the transcripts to my 3 chat sessions with them.  I should post them as they
are quite funny.  They told me my sound card was not supported.  It's a
Diamond MX300....I informed them that I was physically looking at their
website for supported cards and this card *is* indeed listed.  They told me
to disable it anyway.  Didn't work either.  They actually suggested a
complete OS reformat.  I've done this like 3 times in the past week just to
get this damn game to work.  No joy there either.  There's no way in Hell
anyone should have to reformat their system to install any program of any
type IMHO.

Thanks for the advice still.

Sean...
