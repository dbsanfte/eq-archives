You said you tried switching the sticks around, but did you try running on 
just the 2 new sticks? How about each of the new sticks, one at a time? If 
it works fine in those two scenarios (I would just leave the timing set to 
Auto unless your MB manual says otherwise), then I would go through the MB 
manual with a fine-tooth comb looking for any fine print detailing any sort 
of settings required to utilize a full 4GB.

Out of curiousity, does WinXP have any known issues managing 4GB of RAM?
