Though folks at Verant (SOE) will say that any class can solo to 60 (Maybe
65th now?  I last heard someone say this a year ago), most players will tell
you that as a rogue (I'll leave the 'rouge' comments alone) your solo days
are quickly coming to an end.  Rogues are one of the most group dependent
classes. They can do a lot of damage, but take hits worse than Rangers.  If
you can kill an XP-giving monster solo there will be so much downtime that
the game pretty much halts with limited time to play

As with any game, you should spend time on it because it is fun for you.
But time plays a factor too.  If time constraints keep you from grouping for
long, either find a class that is quickly snatched up (cleric?  enchanter?)
or play a class that can solo more effectively.  Most solo Players would
play a necromancer or a druid, but other classes can solo in certain
environments (clerics and paladins in undead areas). Bards also make good
soloers, but are arguably the hardest class to play in terms of interface
manipulation (song and item twisting).

But I am far from expert. If others will naysay me, and prove that rogues
have places to go to solo, I'll not argue their words.
