   I just thought I'd drop my two bits into this long and boring post.

   I get upset, as does Adam Russell, when someone ASKS to inspect me...  
Then I explain: This is a GAME, where the rules allow you to look at each 
other's little cartoon characters. You can see what the items, that these 
cartoon characters are carrying or wearing, are named by inspecting. Why 
in hell would you want to ASK or even be upset if someone didn't ask.

  I think YOU have a bigger problem than worrying about someone 
finding the NAME of something your cartoon character is wearing or 
carrying. You might want to sit down with a professional (at $100 per 
hour) and try working out those deep seated problems.

  Just because you are paranoid, doesn't mean THEY aren't after you.
