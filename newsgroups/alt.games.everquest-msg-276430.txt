Its not that at all.

There was a mitigation change to monks only (to make them take more damage,
period) and *in addition*, monks get an extremely low AC softcap (not much
over 1400 with all defensive aa's)

So in addition to just taking more damage, period, anything over 1400 AC is
worthless in terms of char advancement for monks. Wheras other classes still
gain benefits from AC at 2000+
