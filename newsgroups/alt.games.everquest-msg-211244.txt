Dimension drops in Sol A. With the new Sol C zone and higher levels
killing things just to get to Sol C, you may find words unlooted
there. You can also check the druid ring vendor in Lavastorm. 

As for failures in research: use your training points to max research
skill each level. Practice research is more expensive or extremely
time consuming compared to "buying" the skill from your guild master;
considering the costs of scrolls, trying to skill up using actual
research is also expensive.  As you get better, you will have fewer
failures.  Try buying the level 12 spells to research the level 16;
use the researched level 16's to research the 20's; use the level 20's
to .... 

You also don't necessarily need all 4 pets.  Earth pets usually are
hated in groups because they root, but they are wonderful for stopping
runners when you solo.  Fire pets aren't that good in a group since
their fire shield is useless there, whereas the air pet's stun attack
is very useful in group or solo.  Use your words for the appropriate
pet for your play style first; wait to get the other pets.

Get some bearskin potion bags or deluxe tool boxes as 10 slot
containers for your research components; they are pretty cheap to use
as bank containers. The deluxe tool boxes can be bought in Ice Clad or
Plane of Knowledge for under 2 platinum each. Potion bags are
player-made using a thick grizzly bear skin and a silk cord.
