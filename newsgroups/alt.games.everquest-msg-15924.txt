5 Necros, a Druid, and a small army of pets. Druid throws regen to all
Necros and Sow on everything including pets. Druid tracks and pulls
(possibly with Harmony) hopefully snaring as they bring it in. Once
the target gets in range all 5 Necros throw Fear and sic pets.

If the victim ever turns around and starts fighting, everyone throws
Fear again. If they want to make sure it dies faster each necro gets
assigned one DoT to throw in each fight. If they go this route the
highest level Necro throws the Darkness spell so there is less chance
of a resist.

The Druid? They are medding to get mana back while the Necros make
sure the victim dies. If the Druid really gets low on mana the Necros
can all feed them a couple jolts - the necros all using mana
conversion spells with the regen buff of course...
