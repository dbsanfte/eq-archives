I disagree. It means a player who likes being a druid for some reason
-- the spells, the roleplaying, the tactical differences -- is not
going to be told 'Go away and make a cleric alt'. It means groups want
'healers' and 'tanks' not 'clerics' and 'warriors'. Etc, etc, etc. It
prevents a lot of 'flavour of the month' classes and improves each
person's satisfaction with their class.

One thing I see very little of on the EQ2 boards, as opposed to EQ1 or
WoW, are endless 'Nerf class X!' or 'class X sucks!' posts. The class
balance *works*. (I'm not saying there's NO such threads -- there
always will be -- but there's very little sense that one class is too
good or another should never be chosen.) No player who comes into the
game and picks a class they think will be 'fun' has to fear that when
they get to level 25 or so, they'll find no one will group with them
or accept them in their classes role because 'Druids sucks' or the
like.

Having to choose a class you don't like because otherwise you can't
group does not make for happy gamers.

I really like the new 'training' options, and think there need to be
more. (Once every five levels? Buffed abilities as drops?) They allow
you to compensate for a subclasses weaknesses (I've buffed my
paladin's aggro holding- and gaining-) or to enhance its strengths
(Could have buffed my group buffs, my healing, or my damage-dealing).
