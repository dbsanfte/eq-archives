29 might even be a bit low for Ulthork hunters which only drop bracers and
gloves I believe. Unless you are in a group. You may be able to get some
Tizmak in GD but a tunic is out of the question. I can not solo a Man-O-War
(they drop the tunic) with my level 39 druid because of the massive HPs it
has.
