After a new expansion or other major update you basically right off a weeks
worth of playtime. Still - it's completely predictable so there is no reason
for an Aussie for example to be sitting at his or her monitor cursing the
dark gods for not being able to log in for hours at a time. Just move on and
find something better to do. Keep half an eye on the newsgroup and when
everyone stops whinging put down away the beer and loose women and get back
into it.

Still - I would love to sit back and talk shit about Americans, it's one of
my favourite hobbies, but I can't be bothered tonight because I already have
half a gut full of beer and there is still the prospect of a shot at one of
those aforementioned loose women...
