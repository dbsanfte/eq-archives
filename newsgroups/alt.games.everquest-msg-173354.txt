Here's a few possible ways to deal with this:
- Ask a high level character to deal with it (either by killing the
  skeletons or dragging your corpse away by /consenting them.)
- See if you can organise a Spirit of the Wolf, which will improve your
  running speed. Run close to the skeletons to draw them away from your
  corpse, and over to the guards. Then go back and loot your corpse.
- Log out and create a new, level 1 character. Take him over to the
  skeletons and draw them away. If he dies... no big deal. Log back in
  and loot your corpse.
- Get close enough to the skeletons to nuke them, without being close
  enough to aggro. Turn away in the direction of the guards. Cast your
  nuke. As soon as it finishes, run (to the guards) and let them kill
  the skeleton(s). Also works well in conjunction with a friendly SoW.
  A snare might work better than a nuke here, to give you a head start
  on at least one of them.
- Use Harmony to make them less... sensitive to you. This lets you get
  closer to your corpse to then use /corpse to summon your corpse.
  Be careful of resists (rare but possible).

A (12+) necromancer can also summon your corpse, but that is expensive
and decidedly overkill.

Anyway, basically look at the tools available to you and see what
you can do with them. :-)

As others have suggested... the duration on the snare may have expired.
If it's been a while since your successful snare, try recasting when they
are at 20% (one bubble) or so.

Others have explained this better than I; it's a skill, and improves
with use. Initially it heals very little.
