I was given a URL from one of my guild, he actually plays on this server.
The guild, Flowers of Happiness, are on Rallos Zek which is a PvP server, I
assume they are considered a menace there but this site had me and a friend
in stitches.
It's a very basic site but effective for the content.

Anyone here play on this server, I'd be interested to know if they are a
nuisance?
