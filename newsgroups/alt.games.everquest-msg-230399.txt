Doesnt always drop an epic item...that is part of the problem.  Often drops
two of the same item also (ie the sucky enchanter or shaman items).

Surprised you couldnt / didnt get a bard along to pull, the backbone is a
very rare drop from him and a bard can single pull phinny with ease (without
FM).

Have killed him about 15 times in the past couple of weeks for a bards epic,
can now swim from zone in to ledge in about 20seconds :p

Phinny himself is a wuss, once he stops nuking, weak melee and low hp.  Is
only a problem if you get the CHing adds :)
