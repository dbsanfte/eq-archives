If a patch goes from 3AM PST to 11AM PST, that's 11AM GMT to 7PM GMT.
Yes, that puts the patch during most of Europe's *day*, but most people
play in the evening, so I don't see how this is a major inconvenience
for European players at all.  It's the Asian players that lose a whole
play day to the patch, it seems to me.

In fact, when you consider that many mobs that drop important quest
items are on very long spawn timers, and are up when the servers come
up, European guilds have a big advantage.  The servers come up in your
prime time.  American guilds need to get out of work or school to be on
when the server comes up, and Asian guilds have to stay up very late.

And since many of those quest mobs are on one week timers, it meant that
basically on servers with a European uberguild, you had to be European
to get those mobs.  With 2 weeks between patches, American and Asians at
least get to fight over half the spawns.

The combination of long spawn times and frequent patches at fixed times
is really stupid on Verant's part.
