And it seems you've forgotten why we have a process at all and what its 
founding principles are.  Those who insist "don't talk to me about rights," 
deserve none at all.  It's your shades of grey that have royally botched a 
good republic.

Though, I'm willing to bet that, when it comes to your own key issues, 
wether it be the war in Iraq, reproductive "rights," or what not, it quickly 
becomes a black and white issue.
