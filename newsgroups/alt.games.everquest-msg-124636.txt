Good point, I'll have to make sure to slap at least a point in... but
I almost always do anyway.  I'll come in near death of the victim and
help melee it to death as it runs away, or I'll swing in and lay out a
Chant round...

If the mob you have charmed dies while charmed you get no exp for
it at all.  If it breaks charm before dying its had its memory wiped
of all previous damage, so you don't need to worry about doing
damage to it up till its near death.  Generally I kill the runners via
melee.  I have on occaision charmed the original target and told him
to finish off my old pet, I guess I really need to not do that!

The whole issue of charm wiping your damage list and this change
to pet exp bears some consideration, I'll have to think about it
some more.
