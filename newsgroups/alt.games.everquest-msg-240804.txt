From the shadows, the mysterious Palindrome
<palindrome@btinternet.com> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>Good Lord - Sisson Mania!!  Have you been seeing Sissons anywhere
>unusual?  In your bed?  UNDER your bed?  Are you worried your daughter
>is MARRIED to a Sisson?  Have Sissons plagued your dreams lately?  Do
>you get hot flushes and palpitations when you see or hear the name
>Sisson?  Are you worried any potential grandchildren will be just
>"Americans without brains"?

I think its great that I have so horribly scarred him that he is
stalking me and following my footsteps everywhere I go.

I don't think I've so terribly owned someone in like, forever. :-)

Or maybe he's in love with me? Sorry, @ndrew, I don't lean that way,
ya tosser.

A lying, bigotted, hypocritical tosser.
