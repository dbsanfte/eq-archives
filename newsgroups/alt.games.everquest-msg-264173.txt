But the downside is that your chanter is using up mana to keep all
these guys mezzed.  I'm always amazed at how much extra mana I expend
when I have to keep 3 or more mobs mezzed.  And if someone breaks mez
and the chanter gets killed before remez, you got a group wipe
situation.  With only 1 or mayb 2 mezzed, even if someone breaks mez
it's pretty unlikely for things to get out of control.

Not to say that I don't enjoy the rush of mezzing 3 or 4 guys and then
keeping track of them, running around, remezzing, trying to toss in
tash / slow, etc etc etc...  but not something I want to do all the
time.
