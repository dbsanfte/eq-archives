Those are the "instances" you may have heard about here in discussions about 
instancing. Multiple copies of the same exact zone are made so that when it 
gets too crowded, players can start a new instance. It doesn't matter which 
one you're in unless you're with a group in which case you'll all want to be 
in the same zone.
