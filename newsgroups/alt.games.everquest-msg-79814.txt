They patched these today on the main server, they are the same
versions I was copying over from the test server before getting in EQ
(overwriting the ones the main server patched)

I left myself at 16 bit color in my eq client.ini
and i changed UseUmbra=FALSE to UseUmbra=TRUE (though that probably
just makes it so its not FALSE and deleting that line would do the
same thing)

When I then went in freeport, shar vahl and some other zones the
difference was like night to day. I had little to no graphics lag, and
no graphics lag when in a building even in a complex zone with
clipping out way farther than I usually have it (usually have it on
the bottom)

Don't know about everyone but for my tnt 16 meg agp, p2 400, 585 meg
ram, windows 98, textures set to low and texturecache on it made a
huge diff.

Hopefully when they work that umbra thing out for everyone Raids post
luclin will get much better .. ;)
