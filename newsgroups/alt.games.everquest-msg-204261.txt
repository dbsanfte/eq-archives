I have never once seen the EMarr bazaar full.  Not once in all the many 
many times I have zoned in with any of my characters.  So, perhaps on 
your server, but that does not explain them on EMarr.

The bazaar is the last place I would go if I did want to auction off 
stuff, as I know that were I the potential buyer, I would be ignoring all 
auctions, shouts, and oocs in the bazaar anyway.
