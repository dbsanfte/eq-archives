Well basically there were three lvl 60 encahnters at the raid. One already
had Kodiaks so was down to two of us. Who is the most deserving ? We both
raid as much as each other and had similar levels of ELPs (Event lotto
points) which we use to bid on drops in raids. It would be unfair to waste
ELPs on a spell that drops off a lot of mobs so we just do a random range.
ie Chanter1 is 1-10, chanter 2 is 11-20, random 1 20, roll was 13 so
Chanter2 wins. I think its quite a fair system.
