Yes, of course it isn't true. All I'm wondering is what this guy read that
made him think that.

Also when he said <all> his xp... I *think* what he meant was that if
another rogue joined they would somehow be splitting the "rogue" xp (dang
that makes me laugh just typing it). Therefore, he would then be getting
*less* than the total amount of the XP he could get, which of course equals
*NO* xp to people like that.

FYI while the group was trying to tell him that he was wrong, he offered
this evidence: "I grouped with another rogue just today and I didn't get
hardly *any* xp". How can you refute the hard facts when they are laid out
so simply like that? :)
