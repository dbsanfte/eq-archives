Is this a change to Character Creation?
Old style is Base Racial Stats + 50 points, upto 30 of which are
pre-assigned by which class you pick... leaving you with 20-30 points to
assign yourself.


And check out the .AVI files on the expansion pages...

... yes that IS a froggie dual-weilding 2 swords... AND HE ALSO HAS A
SHIELD!?!?!?

Does this mean froggies are going to be the first race to benefit from those
extra item slots announced elsewhere in the patch blurb from yesterday?
