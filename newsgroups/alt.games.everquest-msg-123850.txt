Well for one thing its made one monks life unbearable, cant pull a
caster mob now to save my neck. The first thing cast is either Root,
Dispell, or Dots all of which mean FD is history or at least Ive never
had FD work with root or dots on me. Think I may just stop playing the
char cause pulling was the best thing about it. Since most mobs I pull
con red or yellow the spells land almost every pull. 

So no its not you its verant turning the whole game upside down on a
whim as always. Monks may be outa bisness in caster heavy dungeons.
Nothing like getting rooted with 4 mobs pounding on ya far far from
any help. They still hit like uber tanks too with the hps to match
btw.
