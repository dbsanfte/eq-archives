As a level 51 enchanter, my stuns are resisted pretty often, even with tash.
Particularly frustrating on a cleric mob.  Mez is resisted quite a bit as
well.  Named mini-bosses are immune to mez.

I, too, have yet to have pacify resisted and I have used it in every
adventure so far.  So I basically have nothing to add, but figured I'd post
a "me too." :-)
