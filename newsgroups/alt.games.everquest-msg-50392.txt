Also, I've seen many people with TBoots and JBoots... they bought
TBoots while younger, then got to where they could solo the AC
in OOT and got the better JBoots.  TBoots are no drop, so they
put em in the bank for CRs.

9-15pp?  Thats ludicrous, when TBoots, basically the same
function, run 5Kpp, and people still snap them up.

Nine plat?  You'll see tenth level non-twinked players with
horses!
