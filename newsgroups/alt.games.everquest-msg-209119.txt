    They likely came from a guild very much like yours. I doubt members of
Cestus Dei decided to walk over to FoH, seeing the state they're in.

    The flags and the loot. If you're that far behind in flagging, odds are
the rots that FoH gets will be significant upgrades on you. Our normal loot
call is "if you need item, send tell now with current item". There's more
than a few elemental-level loots that we loot call with "if you need this
item, you're not on this raid".

    Bet it was. There's a big gap in plate BP itemization for melees. After
Vindi, your next big BP will either be off Cursed or from Vex Thal. Of the
three, Vindi is the one that's almost always up and which can be whacked by
one group. We've got a few new recruits Vindi BPs because of that.
