I went through this too, I'm sure a lot of people have.  I got a Magician
and Paladin up to mid-teens, and it wasn't until my 3rd "real" character
that I managed to go higher (Wizard, currently 31).  The teens is where you
really it starts to get tedious to solo.  Soloing, in most cases, isn't
really that difficult; it just gets boring.

This is a problem.  EQ is really built around grouping.  My advice is to try
and find other "regulars" that are on that server during those hours.  If
you are unable to find regular group mates, you could try a different
server.  Solusek Ro seems to have a lot of European players that are online
during "off-peak" hours in the U.S.  It would be unfortunate to give up on
your existing characters, but it might be worth a try.  In any case, it was
switching from the "solo" mindset to the "group" mindest that got me going
again.  My Wizard took a lot less time to get from 15 to 30 than it did to
get from 1 to 15.  Good groups rock.

As an aside, why is it that Bards seem to be the one class where everyone
else thinks they know how they ought to be played?  In my experience, a Bard
is most likely to be told by some other player, what song to be playing, or
whatever.  I've seen it time and again.  It reminds me of the days of my
youth, playing in bar bands, when people would shout out "Play some ZZ Top"
or whatever.  I think if I started a Bard I'd have a hotkey saying "Sorry, I
don't take requests".

Levels 12-16 are really hard for a Mage.  You don't get any new DD at 12, so
a level 15 Magician's best DD (Fire Bolt) is the same spell being used by a
level 8 Wizard.  This "DD envy" was what convinced me to try again as a
Wizard.  But if you can get through it, Mages are a lot of fun and my first
choice of a solo character.  I've never played a Bard; they seem like a lot
of fun, but it also seems to me like a class that's going to be happier and
more productive in a group.

My best advice is to start focusing on finding groups, one way or another.
Or at least a regular partner or two.  The more people you're fighting with,
the less downtime you should expect (assuming of course they know what
they're doing).  And, if you get some decent groupmates, the social
interaction can make the game much more interesting.

You've already tried the Mage, Druid and Necro, which are supposed to be the
best solo classes, so I don't have any advice on how to solo without the
tedium.  If you focus on group play, you'll probably have most fun with the
bard or rogue, they can both bring a lot to a group.

Hope you get past the doldrums, EQ really does (IMHO) get more fun as you go
up in level.
