I normally don't get involved in flame wars. I find then
counter-productive. In your case, however, and in the case of your
langauage I find I must if nothing more than to intensify the mood you
seem to be in. You deserve it.

One who canot express his or her viewpoints and or emotions without
resorting to vulgarities is displaying not only their contempt for
their audience but their ignorance as well!

Whatever your problem is sir, it is most certainly YOUR problem, not
mine and I will not accept it from you. Imposing it upon others will
not make it go away ot lessen in severity. Venting your wrath on
others simply expends energy that might otherwise be directed towards
solving whatever problem it is that has caused you such discernation.

If I might suggest that you start by focusing your energies on the
source of your situation, namely yourself for we are almost always the
primary cause of our own grief, you might fond solutions that do not
involve imposing yourself on others.

In closing I will state that I understand, from your rather limited
vocabularity of vulgarities, I might have confused you with some of my
words here. In an effort to help you I offer you this link to help you
get a handle on your first problem, namely expressing yourself in an
intelligent and civil manner. It will also help you understand come of
the words you might not be framiliar with.
