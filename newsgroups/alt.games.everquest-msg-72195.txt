On Prexus I've seen people trying to *sell* them for over 300 plat.
But considering how long the people auctioning continued their
auctions, I'd hazard to say no one was interested in buying at that
price.

Personally, I'd never pay more than 50 plat for one. I hunted for my
own, and have 6 in the bank waiting for a day when I feel masochistic
enough to destr... er, combine them.
