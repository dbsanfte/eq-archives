------------------------------

- Fixed a problem with the Gnome sitting animation

- Fixed a bug that was causing some people to crash when repeatedly
right-clicking spell gems

- Made adjustments for Quellious monks attempting to do Iksar Shackle quests

- Fixed a bug in the way that Alternate Experience was being distributed.
Extra experience was being generated for an ungrouped character with all
experience going to the Alternate Experience pool.  Too little experience
was going into the Alternate Experience pool for people grouped that were
applying less than 100% of their experience to the Alternate Experience
pool.

- Fixed stacking issues with Circle of Seasons and Talisman of Epuration

- Wild Lord's armor effects are now level restricted

- Fixed a bug with necromancer pets that was preventing them from gaining
the healing benefit of lifetaps.  It turns out that this was affecting all
NPCs.  It should now be working properly for both pets and NPCs.
