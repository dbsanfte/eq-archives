Don't wanna say it, but...

Told ya so :o)

Since the newbie changes I've started a new Monk, Rogue and SK on a 2nd
account... all of them are seriously lagging behind in Offence and
Defence... the Monk's the worst... level 26 and his Defence is stuck around
65.

Seems like new characters simply aren't hanging around in the low levels
long enough to take a beating often enough to learn from it :o)
