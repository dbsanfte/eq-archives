hmm
Sorry folks but SW:G is coming out soon enough... I'll be taking a break
from online gaming.

Though I might not play SW:G either if that happened. Catastrophic failure
of the backup system? Where I work every building could burn to the ground
and we could recover the backups, though it may take a week or so to get new
hardware to restore them with and onto. Our backup safes are tough. Then
there's the (admittedly 7-14 days old) off-site backup. Our data is our
life. No data, no business. They are the same way even if they don't admit
it.
