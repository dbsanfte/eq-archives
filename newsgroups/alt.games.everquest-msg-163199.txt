Aha!  A nit to pick!  Wimpy little drakes in Butcherblock and Steamfont
AoE.  Even once had a Plague Rat KS me in Steamfont because he agro'd
on a drake after being caught in the AoE and then got the killshot.
Anyway, back in the GoodOldDays(tm) it seemed that most everybody spent
a (very) little time in each of those zones before fleeing gibbering to
a place less crowded with juvenile public channel spammers and buff
beggars.
