Ok, I'm very definitely partisan, and opinionated about political matters.
I'm assuming that nobody here wants my opinions about WHO to vote for.

So, I aint gonna say a WORD about my political leanings.

Just vote.  Find the time, miss 20 minutes of work. go to the grocery
TOMORROW, instead of today, but VOTE.

If you hate them all, vote for the one you hate the least.

Protesting by not voting does NOT send ANY message except that you don't
care, and they can do whatever they want to you.  If you have to, write in
Antonius Bayle, but go vote.

This has been a public service announcement from your friendly local
blacksmith.
