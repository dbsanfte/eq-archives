sure but that's in the context of a woman, which is not what we're talking
about, the context here is cowardly behaviour.  Ever call a man a pussy for
wimpish behaviour? Ever described a footbeller as a pussy when he
purposefully didn't try his hardest?  It's a different context, different
meaning and different word roots and it's the word roots for pussy used as
coward which we were debating.
