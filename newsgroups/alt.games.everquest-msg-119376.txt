The rest not being worth responding to, there's this point. It does
not "appear to turn itself off because <I> don't see attack
messages....because the server won't let <me> attack....". It's off.
The flashing red around the window turns off, I'm not attacking when I
stand up. I have been in situations with autoattack on where the
server wouldn't let me attack before (Both hands holding non-weapon
items), the flashing red line around the box with the HP/mana bars
stays on.
