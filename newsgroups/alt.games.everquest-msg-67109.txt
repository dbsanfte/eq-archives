If you buy almost any game the day/week it comes out you will always pay
more.  And you will also generally have to fight with the patch headaches,
regardless of the title.  It's sad, but they make their biggest pile of $$$
from the "die-hard" fans, then later lower the price to lure in others.
Best Buy almost never carries a game until a week after it comes out, and
with a reduced price tag.  At least that's how the ones here in southern New
Hampshire seem to work.
I've said it before and I'll say it again, buy ANY game/OS/ or other
software upon initial release and you not only pay more, you are basically
an "extended Beta-tester".
I paid $30 for it too.  I'm over it already.  However, good luck with your
class-action lawsuit.  If you are successful please forward me $16.  Thank
you.

Good luck,
Sean...

P.S.  I've only been playing this game since July and I can't think of how
many times I've seen people cry "class-action lawsuit".
