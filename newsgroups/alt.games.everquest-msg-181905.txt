Damnit, I downloaded a new Xnews, and forgot to set my filters to delete 
crossposting.

Sparkup, in case you haven't noticed, it has been nice around here 
lately without him. Now you troll on in with this bullshit. If we have 
killfiled him, we have no want or need to talk about him. Welcome to the 
killfile right next to him. Idiot.
