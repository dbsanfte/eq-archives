So I gather a group with three post 60 tanks, post 60 cleric, Me a 59
shaman, and a post 60 druid.

I guess I am whining, but what gives with the revamp of the zone.
Golem like MoBs which are everywhere have heavy MR, and I could only
get my disease slow to stick and received a message telling me even
that low end slow only partially works. Tried to 57 malio them but got
tired of the bouncing and mana waste. Granted some Mobs are still
slowable but odds are you run into the ones that heavy resist it or
can slightly.

We made it to the castle, filled with Ghosts, Gargoyles, Golems all
with their own particular resistances mostly to conventional slows and
then you don't get the full effect. Basically these MoBs just wear you
down, they spawn fast, (we timed the MoBs inside on an 8 minute timer)
So if you hope to stay outside the castle and pull there to clear
courtyard can be problematic as golems patrol constantly and respawn
too. So after we made it into the court yard, we get jumped into it to
avoid the wanders outside and repopping guards when we are jumped by
three MoBs, one of which was, A Temple Researcher,
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12941 , who agro'd
wiped the floor with us. Hit me 4 times for almost 300 HP each. Irony
was even if we made it, I had done it all wrong as Kirn is in a new
place for the hand off and then spawns in the tower.

The moral of the story, just when you thought you were finally high
enough to get to Kirn without a raid, your wrong.

Going to put all the pieces for epic back into bank and forget about
it for another year. My guild and I are casual players getting 12 plus
60 level players to raid it just isn't going to happen.

Below is a link, scroll down comments. There is a good map showing you
the locations of Kirn 1 and Kirn 2 and what to do.

Best of luck to the rest of you Shamans
