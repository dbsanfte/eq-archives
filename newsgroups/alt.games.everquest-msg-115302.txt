I've been hunting in stone brunt giving the local wild life a hard time, and
at the same time collecting some wak's (I have loads of poison sac's, so its
only limited to claws). Has anyone noticed since the last patch that they
drop like mad now? In 4 hours i had about 10 claws, and i was only killing
the panda's that went passed the bowl.
Before the patch on the other hand I would send 2-3 days in there hunting
only panda's and get a couple if i was lucky, i even asked some high level
titan hunters to kill the panda's in exchange for me running around tracking
for titans, and they could chew up panda cubs, but even they didnt have any
luck.

Has anyone else noticed a big increase of drops of 'a panda claw'?

Not that im ranting in any way :)
