Bingo.  Passive sniffer is the key here.  There's no way in snowy hell
Verant can tell I'm running showeq.  If they found out you're using it, you
mouthed off and told someone you shouldn't have.

Same here.  I was watching EQ packets with tcpdump loooong before I ever got
interested in showeq.  Cheating...hmmm, I dunno - so I can see a mob across
the zone - BFD, so can that level whatever ranger that just zoned in looking
for the same thing.  OH! yeah, I can see your level even if your anon/rp
BFD!  Let me see what else, um...oh yeah, I can see my skill values, exp
numbers.  My understanding is early on, showeq gave a LOT more information
than what you can gleen from it these days.  Spawn point mapping is kind of
cool, spawn logging.  I actually have more fun now (after paying my dues w/o
showeq) just kind of looking at the different mobs in the zones and pathing
etc.... i.e. - 'the mist' level 1 invisible warrior just along the edge of
the eastern lfay zone edge.  whoopty freakin do.  boy I'll make a ton of
plat with that knowledge.

Still haven't found 'pain and suffering' although I hear it's definitely a
mob.  Any thoughts?

You should.  By your post you would get a helluva kick out of it.  (and
become marginally bored with just as quickly ;-) )
