Exactly. On our server Sebilis had 70 ppl any night of the week and
weekends until PoP came out, because it was the place for experience,
and, even more important, you could get a group there, or the chance was
higher than almost anyplace else in the world other than maybe Velks.

Even 2 weeks into EQ's life, the early levelers were all congregated in
Unrest. Again, because not only was that where the experience, and loot
was, but because you could get a group there.

The fact is, for most people, there's 2 ways to have fun in EQ. Either
you go in with enough friends to have a regular group to join nightly,
in which case you can explore the out of the way places at your leisure
and have a lot of fun, or you all crowd into the same zone because the
chances of finding a group are higher for everyone. There wasn't even an
lfg flag back then so other than shouting/oocing to the zone, there was
no way to find a group. Many friendships and guild affiliations that
still exist on our server today were forged in Unrest groups in the
first month of EQ's existance.

In early EQ, it was pretty easy for everyone to find a group. Hell, some
of the first to 50 on our server did it with a group where they used a
ranger as a tank and the cleric spent half his time nuking. No one
fussed about having a warrior, enchanters were originally quite rare
because the class was so gimped on release no one but a couple of die
hards played them.

However, those complaining about the books are completely ignoring the
huge lengths people went to to avoid travelling back then. People
congregated in the same spots, bound as close as possible, and
completely ignored other dungeons because of the pain in the ass forming
a group and travelling to them was. People even left corpses in zones
like Lower Guk so they could get rezzed back rather than run it after
running to town to sell.

Most people I've met over the years want to log in, spend as little time
looking for a group as possible and get to killing mobs someplace. They
don't want to add 20-30 minutes of travel time, for instance, logging in
Cazic Thule, only to log in the next day and find their friends went
back to Unrest because they couldn't form a group in Cazic. (this
actually happened to me, when a group of us from Unrest went to find and
explore the rumored zone of Cazic Thule at around 25, got there, had
great fun for a few hours, then logged out. One person logged in early,
got bored sitting around, and went back to Unrest, so the rest went back
as well, adding a boring 30 minute run and boat ride to our day's fun.
