I dont know.  I played uo and it was great at first and eventually i got 
tired of it.  Then eq came out and I did thoroughly enjoy that.  I do not 
think having already played uo detracted from the newness of eq.  I do think 
that any new game has to at least match the quality of eq in order to not 
look like a cheap knockoff.
