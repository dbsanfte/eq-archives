On the whole, I agree. Generally speaking, a MMORPG comprises three main 
elements: Sense of Place, Character Progression and Community Building. 
The last two are generally orthogonal to each other, but they both can 
have a definite impact on the first. For example, since everybody in 
Norrath is telepathic, there is no use for meeting places like inns for 
anything other than brewing supplies. Serverwide channels killed the 
makeshift marketplaces like the EC tunnels, etc. At the same time, 
travel times were getting in the way of the smooth progression that 
players demanded, hence things like removing the need for getting 
anywhere on foot first in Velious in order to use the ports (an elegant 
idea, I found), and -ultimately- the PoK.

I think that the main cause of the sacrifice of the Sense of Place at 
the altar of Character Progression was the unfair differences in 
soloability for the different character classes. As a Druid, I could log 
in, kill things for an hour, and log out. Travel, if anything, added 
interest to a session. For a melee player who already had to spend a 
significant chunk of time looking for a group, adding travel on top of 
that, plus the distinct possibility of being stranded and useless in a 
far-away zone made it obvious that they would clamor for the world to be 
made smaller.
