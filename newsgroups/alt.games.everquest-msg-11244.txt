That seems, um, reasonably useless.

You couldn't use it to fight in underwater dungeons like
Kedge Keep because you'd be holding a fishing rod instead
of a weapon.  And you can't even fish underwater either...

About the only thing it would be good for is unarmed
underwater travels, like hunting for a sunken corpse,
or perhaps getting into Kedge Keep until you can meet
up with your group and someone who can cast EB on you
(or evacuating out of Kedge Keep if the EB'er has died
or gone LD).

On the other hand, I've gotten some good use out of
my Fishbone Earring when I'm fighting on the Seafury
Cyclops island -- when I want to go AFK safely and not
be squashed by wandering Seafuries, I go 50 yards
offshore and meditate underwater...

I suppose a fishing rod with the same effect could
be used likewise.
