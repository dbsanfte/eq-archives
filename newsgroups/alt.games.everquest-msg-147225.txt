That would be interesting, but I think the real usefullness of raid groups
is not going to be in allowing everyone to get XP, but rather in allowing
everyone to loot without having to wait for the mob to become generally
lootable.  Being able to have the winner of a no-drop item loot it right
away will be a good thing.
