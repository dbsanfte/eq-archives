The only way having a few hundred plat at your disposal is truly a 
difficulty is if you are a true newbie and don't have any knowledge of 
the game, where to hunt, or what is valuable. Otherwise, making a few 
hundred pp is pretty trivially easy, even at level 10. Its not wildly 
fun for hours on end and doesn't level you up so I wouldn't suggest 
anyone grind out a few k but a few hundred pp is a small investment in 
time.

At any rate, a true newbie wouldn't know about the abysmal sea quests 
anyway. So its 6 of 1 to a half dozen of the other. You can either tell 
the newbie how to make a little quick cash, or you can tell him to head 
to abysmal sea. Same difference.

For what its worth, my untwinked iks necro, 115 int, did the brewing 
quest, and even I had maxed my skill within the first 2 stacks of 
components. After that I had to combine 5-8 additional stacks to get the 
100 successes, at each stage.

Twinked int/wis helps, but even untwinked the skillups come pretty quick 
at that level.

Actually I'm serious. And my 10 minute number is a lot more realistic 
than yours was for doing the abysmal sea combines. =)

There are several places with decent drop rates. The spawns aren't fast 
enough to spend all day massing up backpacks full of silk, but I only 
stipulated you needed 10. Getting a half stack of silk still only takes 
10 minutes or so.

Given that you can get as many backpacks full of bonechips as you want, 
for around 2.5 gold and 5 seconds of time per stack I'm going have to 
disagree.

Fair enough. I think the issue is that I see no real advantages to it 
either. Its not necessarily a superior route to take to get your 
tradeskills started.

For myself, I'd rather pop the 20 training points in and perform <100 
combines for <100pp then waste my time on 600 mindless combines + 
turnins.

I don't think the abysmal sea is a 'bad deal', I just don't think its a 
particularly good one.
