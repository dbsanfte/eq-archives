Right click on the bar for the window labeled "Main Chat" and scroll
down the menu to  where it says "Languages". You will see a submenu
with all of your languages and just click on the one you want to have
as your default. It will stay there until you pick another default
language so make sure to reselect when you are done with that
language.
