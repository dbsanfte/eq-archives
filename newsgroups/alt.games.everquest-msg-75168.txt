Hmmm, spells never much of a burden in EQ?  Prior to my sending my Vah Shir
Bard a shipment of cash, he had attained level 5, and had his first 2 songs.
I seem to recall that for any other casters I made, my shaman included, I
had to scrounge around for enough money to keep myself in food and drink and
still somehow afford to buy my spells.  Eventually, as I got into higher
levels, I found it easier and easier to do, but even as high as 29 I seem to
recall spending every last plat I had to buy my last spells.  Mind you, now
that I make and sell SoW potions, solo HGs and SGs, I am finding that I can
easily afford to send some cash to any new character I make.
