Sure. And if you'd been twinking a caster you could have sold the second
one for KEI money instead of a CoF.... and actually, while not *as* useful,
my twinkee druid still has haste & regen. Its not like these are actually
melee only utility ;)

soon" , but I still enjoy the point-blank unlimited target AoE, regen & 
fungi assault method ;)
