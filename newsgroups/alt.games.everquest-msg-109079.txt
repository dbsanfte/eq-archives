Eventually we'll pull our heads out of our kiesters.

Because it is a significant distinction.

Just because all sides claim to be right doesn't mean none of them are.  To
claim otherwise would be sheer sophistry.

No, it was tragic, and unfortunate, but part and parcal of what happens when
we go to war against the de-facto government of that nation (note the use of
de-facto, as opposed to recognized).  Had we done that in different
circumstances, than we should be called to task for it.

So you assert.  I disagree.  As I posted in a different reply, it's the
difference between perception.  Yes, the victors write the history books,
but it doesn't change who was actually right and who was wrong (which may,
in fact, be opposite of what history says).  Here's a quick test.  If you
have to warp the facts, you may not be entirely in the right.
