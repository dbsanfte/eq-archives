Not so much Nerfed, but Mages have a serious lack of good equipment.
Aside from the "general" int-caster stuff, there's nothing decent for mages.
Just look at the high level quest armor which gives free buffs, free
healing, free nukes and lets even tanks do some spellcasting. Mages get:
summon bandages, reclaim energy, summon bandages, summon bandages, reclaim
energy. And that's about it. Sure the stats are more or less normal, but
give the armor some fun-uses as well please!

Also the mid-level quests are pretty worthless. The clay bracelet's Eye of
Zomm is fun, admitted, but the inv vs animals on the boots is not all to
well, and you want speed-boots a few levels after that anyway. The robe
sucks and the head-gear is surpassed by 40pp items gotten at lvl 16 while
the quest needs at least lvl 25+.
Later on the mage-specific drops as in i.e. KC are simply worthless.

Someone said Verant likes to minimise the equipment for the pet-classes,
Nerco and Mage, and I'm really starting to believe him now that I am looking
at equipment upgrades. It's a good thing the pets are so damn good or I
would have given up long ago.

<rant>
And what the heck is the purpose of giving mages no means of
slowing/stopping a mob except via pets? Heck, even Necro's get clinging
darkness to slow mobs down (and fear, but that's besides the point). It's
annoying being the only caster class, including wis-casters, not to be able
to root when you need it.
