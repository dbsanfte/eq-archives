I call a routine which either forces your monitor to switch resolutions, or
suddenly displays in only 1/2 your screen, buggy. Yes, I know, you feel that
people should pay for anything they get. Since Verant wants them to pay extra
for a software routine which does not annoyingly switch their screen sizes back
and forth, well.... they should pay for it!

I, on the other hand, feel that as the only thing that vpatch.exe can modify is
to fix a problem, there is nothing wrong with plugging it in. 

To you it is not a bug fix, to me it is. Let's leave it at that.
