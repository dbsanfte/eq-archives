There's a great story I read one, I -think- by Mark Twain but I haven't 
been able to find it again, on this topic.

Basically, Peter and God are sitting around up on a cloud looking down 
at the mess we are making of the world.  I don't get it, says God, how 
clear could I be, I told them not to kill each other... how can humans 
kill humans?

They don't, says Peter, look.  They are killing Kikes and Jews and...


well, I don't remember the actual racial and religious epithets being 
used in the story, but the point was, we humans have the remarkable 
ability to turn other humans into something else, which we can then 
freely hate and kill.

Grage

ps if anyone can come up with the name and author of that story, I'd 
love to read it again
