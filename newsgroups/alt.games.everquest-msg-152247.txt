I tried typing the account key on the inside of the Trilogy pack (under the
cd). When I did this it told me that it was already registered (I did use it
when i started the account).  I don't understand why since I never deleted
the program and when I logged on to reactivate it still accepted my station
name and pass from 14 months ago.  Is it possible that since I canceled my
account and allowed my characters to be erased from the server that somehow
it doesn't recognize me as having the expansions?  I'm stumped.
