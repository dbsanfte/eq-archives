Just so you know that we don't all play that much, I play if I'm lucky 8
hours spread over the weekdays, and then perhaps 10-15 hours every 4th
weekend. So probably on average 10 hours a week.

This explains why my highest char is 33 after 2 years :-P

If I did not have a small child and a demanding girlfriend and far too
many other things to worry about then I would play far more. 

Ho humm,

Jim
