Yes, you really can't build faction with Cov by just regular outdoor
giants or wolves. You could try but will stick at scowl for eons. You
really have to go on at LEAST one kael raid. ONE kael raid which kills
some stuff will probably get you to glower, boom like that. It did
with me then at that point you can start quests in Skyshrine like the
velium spiders legs (from spiders in skyshrine that they don't kill if
you kill, and the spiders have no faction) ALSO to a sentry ( kale
again I think) The thing is to do the quest below the RIGHT kale has
to be up, or he will just give you the spider one. 
It also may take a few times to get the bracer also, I had two on 
before i got a planes druid bracer and they are quite nice.

Bonus is in doing that spider leg quest also, you occasionally
(rarely) get a very nice ring with is like 3 ac and 4 wis 4 int or
someting.
