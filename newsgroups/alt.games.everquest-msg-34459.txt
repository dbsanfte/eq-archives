Actually, I believe that that could be interpreted in two different ways,
one is the way you are interpreting it, the other is the way everyone else
is interpreting it, both appear perfectly valid.  "Threatened" would be the
past tense of "threaten".  Someone did threaten Lokari's account (her BTW),
therefore, her account was threatened.  It was not in any danger, but
someone did indeed threaten her account.
