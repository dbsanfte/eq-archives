No doubt.  I mean, we had a good shot at beating this on our first try, 
and that after 6+ hours of doing other raiding first.  If we'd been 
fresh, or known a little more, we could probably have taken out the 
entire RC and spawned the AOE.  Having not yet faced him, I can't say 
whether we'd have beat him, but thats for another day.

Not only do we have levels, but we've got SOME gear thats better than 
anything they had, hot zone augments in particular come to mind.
