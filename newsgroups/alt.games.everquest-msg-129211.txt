Back to the "blame the other guy" blame-game again.  So typical for Arabs.
What the fuck "good" is your "he said/she said" finger pointing, and
"condem the other guy" shit ?  Make a name for yourself - put your nose
to the grindstone, *ignore* outside distractions, and you will become
the most respected race on the planet!  The Itialians, the Irish, the
Polish, the Chech's the Ukraines ALL risked their lives to migrate
over to this great land we call the USA and didn't care ONE iotia
about thie home land, and they even HAD a state !  These imigrants
MADE this nation what it is now, so hard work, and due diligance
and FOCUS *does* work.  And when you slam Americans and blame America
for the Arab problems, you are blaming *generations* of the aformentioned
European imigrants, and guess *what*, when it comes time, they *are*
gonna stand up for this country, make no doubt about it!

What would be an interesting fact/figure to learn, is just how many
Arab imigrants came to the USA between, say the 1930's and 1960.
Anyone have thoes figures? Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that
the EU imigrants were smart enough to leave their troubled homelands
in search of a better life for themselves, and their offspring, but
I just don't see this with the Arabs - they would rather fester in
the mess they created.


> Problem is that those are the US and Israel.

Naaaaa, never an Arab problem is it? - always someone *elses* fault.


> Do you condem terrorism *whoever* enguages in it?

I condem "apathy" no matter *who* elects to be apathetic. (ergo the Arabs)
