Being drunk decreases the size of your mana pool, increasing the
visible effect of mana regen while leaving it unchanged, AIUI.

In other words, while sober your mana pool is 200, and you regen
10 per tic. You see a tiny movement in your bar every six seconds.
You get very drunk, your int drops to 15 and your mana pool is now
20. You still regen 10 per tic, but oh my god, you just got half
your mana pool back in one tic, thats amazing.

In other words, I dont believe it helps; in fact, if the time to
sober up and regain your original mana pool exceeds the amount of
time it would have taken to med it back in the first place it makes
matters worse, although as increasing mana pool size by such slow
fractions isnt visible in the blue bar you may well not be aware
of it.

It does make meditating less tedious I suppose :-)
