I discovered that the hard way.  I finally got through level 30.
"Woot," I thought...I screw around in the old world, TP back to the
Dreadlands on my way to Overthere.  "Gorenaire begins to cast a
spell."  "Oh!  That's that dude who's always shouting to the
zone...where is-"  LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.  *grumblegrumble* TP back to
DLs.  "Where the fuck is my cor-" Gorenaire claws YOU for some
ridiculous amount of damage that kills YOU instantly!  You have LOST a
level!  You are now level 30!  DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT...I lost 2
yellow bubbles in a span of 15 minutes.

Gorenaire is now on my "revenge" list.
