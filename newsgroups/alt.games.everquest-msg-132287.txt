OK good point, that what I like. The only thing that would keep me
from believing that people will come back or should I say 'the new
player' to go to an old game is that it's just not Verant and Sony
making these type of games,I mean there are quite a few mmorpg coming
out within the span of 3months. I have left out World of Warcraft,
which already has a huge fan base which includes EQers, City of
Heroes, where you can be your own superhero and actually change the
city scape as you fight. And as far a the EQ typefantasy genre, just
way to many to name. E3 this year was flooded with them. both good and
bad ones. Theres the" Fellowship of the Ring" online game, where you
can pick one of the charater from the book and you get a party and
play out the story .You want to be Legolas or Strider, well you got
it. Codemaster is coming out with a fantasy online game, FF11 or what
ever number is next and the list goes on and on. But the bottom line
is technology and progress move forward , for a game to get better it
must advance or get lost behind big and better games, Thats why EQ2
was developed to start with . EQ just can't be modifiy that much to
keep up with out it being another game. What if they said" BIG Patch
on tuesday, estimated downtime 2 days" and after you logged back on
you found yourself in EQ2 , but they don't call it EQ2 because it was
a patch.
Would the Die hards Quit eq 2, no , i highly doubt it because it would
still be EQ after a patch. But you just can't change that code that
much, its too old. 
Hell I still like to play "Pirates" every now a then but because it's
an old game it tends to crash, all I can assmue is it can't relate to
the system anymore.
The game has to keep up  and  that cost $$$ and really it's not the
playrs that make money itsthe execs and they hate waste and it would
be a waste of money to upgrade EQ in 1 or 2 years Max to what EQ2 was
when it came out.
