Wow, maybe newbie guids should mention this in display options. ;)  Just was
fiddling around there and turned it all the way up and WOW!!  What the hell
was I looking at before?  Hehe.  What I am shocked at is that my poor
low-quality S3 Diamond Stealth III 16mb ram can handle it fine in 1024res,
all details on high and plane clipping maxed in Kunark no less.  Guess my
machine isn't that bad after all.

Now if I could only dump my HSP 56 WINmodem and get a 3com so my pings would
be 200 instead of 425.
