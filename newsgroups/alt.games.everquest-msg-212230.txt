I've got a pretty good group with 5 other guildies, and we hunt great
together.  Everyone knows how everyone else plays, and we can pretty much
forcast each other's moves.  This is all fine and good, but sometimes
they're ready to call it a night before I'm ready to quit for the eve.

I've been looking for good solo spots for when my group's down for the
night, but have yet to find something with decent XP (or is 52 just a slow
XP level)?  I read about Raptor Isle being good kiting spot, but after
spending about eight cycles there last night, I thought the XP sucked.

I've been thinking about moving on to CS to kill some Wyverns (my CoV is
pretty good from giant slaying), but still kinda iffy about it from previous
wipeouts a few levels ago from the Drakes.

Any suggestions?
