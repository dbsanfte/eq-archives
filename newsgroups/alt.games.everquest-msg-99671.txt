And another God to Actually try and take on with high Level Characters,
Tarew Marr, I think...  But not the only one.  With the pictures they have
shown about Planes of Power, it also suggests possible other zones to
access the other planes of the gods.

Like for instance:
http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/shadeweaversthicketmap.html

Not even the most advid adventurers we know of have ventured into this
zone...  Could it be the zone of Fire shown earlier in one of the leaked
pictures?

Reason I say this, is that it is guarded by a named Fire Elemental with a
600pt nuke.  A guild member managed to sneak pass the guard, only to burn
to a cinder by lava and fire.
