I did just that for a while.  In fact, I just re-subscribed this past week,
which is the only reason I decided to weigh in on the subject at all.
They'll still not get me to pony up more cash for OoW, but after trying the
trials of DAoC and SWG, it's still the best thing going for all of it's
faults.

That said, the fact that re-upped doesn't preclude me from having a negative
opinion regarding some aspects of their product.  I have no illusions that
they're going to change a thing, particularly not with EQ2 just around the
corner.  And I wouldn't have started this thread myself.  But as long as
someone started it ... well, as my wife is fond of saying about me,
"Everyone's entitled to my opinion.". :-)
