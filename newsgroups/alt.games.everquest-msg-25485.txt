Well, I tried to make a small turn right after I stop and it seems to work.
The interrupt rate dropped considerably so it seems to work.

At first I thought it was my channeling but I have all my skill maxed. Well
... except maybe divination. I really need to max that one.. I could not
believe my eyes when I tried to cast Sunbeam and wasted half of my mana at
level 25 trying to get a single cast through. That is A LOT of fizzles :))
Of course, the sunbeam wore off in 2 seconds after cast :) Ah, well.

Thanks to everybody who helped me out on this one.
