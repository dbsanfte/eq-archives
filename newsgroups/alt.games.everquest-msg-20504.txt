The Evil Outpost had Gargoyle guards near the gate, and all three types of
Golems inside.  (Giant clay golems patrol the breaks in the walls, Stone
and Iron Golems guard the buildings inside.)  The Gargoyles are just
standard for their type, except that they aren't aggro to everyone (only to
"good" races.)  They're actually some of the most reliable guards in the
game in my opinion, because they never wander around and there are four of
them in a relatively small area.  If you're soloing near there and can make
it up the ramp to the gate, odds are you'll survive.  Not much that wanders
in that zone can deal with the four of them piling on at once.
