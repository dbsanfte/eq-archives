For what it's worth [ o/~ There's something happenin' here.  What it is, 
ain't exactly clear... o/~ ], that happened to me, too, when I was killing 
Gargs.  I would kill a few sisters with my Necro ( and they still 
considered me as Allies, the stupid wenches ) to get halberds for Goner, 
and he wouldn't equip them some of the time.  I never made the "level 16" 
association like you did, though.  I am pretty sure I put in a bug report 
on it at the time, but that was 6 months ago, easy.
