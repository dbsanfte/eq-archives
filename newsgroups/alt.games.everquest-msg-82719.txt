What the hell were you doing there?

Sounds like this is your first character, and that's your total fortune
in this world. If so, you're RICH for level 3! Gratz. I would first
advise to buy NOTHING from vendors with your newfound windfall.  I would
advise you to ding 5 first, which you can do in the newbie area with
weapons that drop off orc pawns and decaying skellies and such, and make
sure your money is in the bank. If you die and lose your corpse by not
finding it in 30 minutes, your money will be gone if it's not in the
bank. After you've made 5 and your corpse will last longer, go into east
commons and auction to buy a weapon and some new armor.

For a weapon, auction that you're offering a couple of plat for a fine
steel or preferably magic vellium sword. (If it's magic, you'll be able
to hit certain creatures later, such as wisps and ghouls, which can
*only* be hit by magic weapons.) If you're lucky, some high level who's
there auctioning will either just give you one, recognizing you as a
true newbie, or sell you one for a couple plat. They don't cost much.

Then, auction for a tailor to make you some armor. Newbie tailors are
always looking to make a little extra cash, and one of them would likely
make you a full set of leather armor on the cheap. (few gold each. They
usually end up just selling them back to vendors for next to nothing, or
destroying them, as they practice to get the skill up.) Again, you may
get lucky and get a good deal on a couple of pieces of armor from
slightly more experienced folks who see you are a true newbie and pretty
broke.

Once you've got better armor and weapons, stick the rest in the bank and
keep it for emergencies. You'll need it in the days to come. Warriors
are the most equipment dependent class in the game.

If you log out, restart, and experience the same thing two or three
times in a row, do a /bug report of it in-game, and e-mail tech support
about your problem. You may also want to run the thorough file check
from the patch server to make sure you have all the latest fixes, etc.
downloaded.

Good luck.
