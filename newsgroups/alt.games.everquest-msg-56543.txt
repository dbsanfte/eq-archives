Actually, this reminds me of a question I keep forgetting to ask.

Have been told that Beg is actually a useful taunt on MOB's as well, so if
your warrior has both high Taunt and high Beg they should be able to get it

Is this true?   and if so, what is the easiest/quickest way to raise your
beg skill without annoying everyone?
