I'm leaving the above in, on the off-chance that maybe you'll actually 
read it, and pay attention, but I doubt it.

This example is worthless.  It doesn't show jack shit.  First, you don't
show the ratio of the weapons you're using (yeah, I know a gnoll hide
lariet is 3/20, and I looked up the stats on a serrated bone dirk 8/27,
but these two items have NOWHERE NEAR THE SAME RATIO.)  I will bet you a
LARGE amount of money, real or EQ, that you'll do a LOT more damage with
the serrated bone dirk EVEN THOUGH IT'S SLOWER.
I think I know what you're trying to prove here, but you are completely
and utterly flawed in your analysis.  You post these logs like they mean
something, but the first one, you have 100 seconds of logs, the second one
has 72 seconds, and the third one has 35 seconds.  Why don't you find two
weapons with the EXACT SAME RATIO, but different speeds, and then parse
them both for 100 seconds against the same mob.  Other than the very small
advantage that faster weapons have due to the +1 part of the (2dam +1),
which is MUCH smaller than the advantage in the primary hand, there will
be no difference.


> Here is a quick example from my logs from this morning of why the "only the 
> ratio matters" doesn't fit the actual damage model: 

OK, how about this, I amend my statement to only the amended ratio
matters.  The ammended ratio is (2dam + 1)/delay.  It's more correct than
only the ratio matters, but really immaterial in any case other than this
hair-splitting here.

Please, before you make more of a fool of yourself, learn something about 
mathmatics, statistics, and analysis.  Your statement that you get more 
successful dual-weild attacks with a faster weapon is true, BUT YOU ALSO 
GET MORE UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACKS.  In other words, in a 60 second battle, 
with a 10/20 weapon and a 20/40 weapon, and a 40% chance of dual-wield 
firing, you will have 12 successfull and 18 unsuccessful and 6 successful 
and 9 unsuccessful attacks respectively.  
If dual-wield percentage were 100%, i.e. it went off every time like the 
primary, would you still be confused?  Please please please do the math, 
and then post your results.
