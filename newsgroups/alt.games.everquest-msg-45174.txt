You boot to DOS mode and rename the windows and program files folder.
However, I would suggest not stopping there. I supported Windows 9X
for Microsoft for 1.5 years, and this is how we used to do it. Make
sure you have your system's product ID number. You'll need it during
setup. If you can't find it, it's a group of 25 letters and numbers
located in the registry in the following spot. Look it up by going to
start>run and typing regedit.

Hkey_local_machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion

Presuming you have a normal Win98 CD and not a recovery disc, boot to
DOS with a 98 or Me boot floppy and follow these steps exactly:

ren windows winold
ren progra~1 progold
attrib -r -s -h msdos.sys
ren msdos.sys *.xxx
attrib -r -s -h system.*
ren system.* *.old
ren autoexec.bat *.xxx
ren config.sys *.xxx
cd winold
ren win.com *.xxx
attrib -r -s -h *.da*
ren *.da* *.xx*
ren vmm vmmold
cd vmmold
ren vmm32.vxd *.xxx

Then stick your CD in, switch to the letter of your CD ROM drive, and
type setup. It should run from there. When it's finished setting up,
copy the directories inside the progold folder into the program files
folder that the setup has just made. Then you reinstall your programs,
and yes, most, but not all, you WILL have to reinstall. They'll
usually pick up on prior installations and keep your settings and
such. You will keep all your data, all your saved game files, emails
and whatnot, but you will have a new installation of Windows free from
old registries and other bits and pieces of the old install that setup
could possibly pick up.

It's a commercial product made by Symantec. You can order it online
from www.symantec.com. I'm not going to say one thing or the other
about this program, but I personally don't trust software that
promises to improve how Windows itself runs. But that's just me.

Partition Magic sucks. Don't touch it. I wouldn't trust any program
that messes with the partition structure when the drive still has data
on it that you don't want to lose. At least not without a backup made
immediately beforehand.
