Bah, wouldn't have tried it with my bard, she's been sleeping for a 
while so I can
get Bebinn up to a decent level.
I just got lucky on that. I've never even seen Stormfeather prior to 
that day.  I just saw this huge thing pop and my jaw dropped on the 
floor.  Someone had been camping him earlier that day but he gave up 
about 2 hours before and logged.
It was fun, I feared him and he took same pathing as the cougars, 
straight down to the dock.  Knew I could take him when I saw that.  Had 
gate up just in case I needed it too.  Got a little hairy when my pet 
died, he started resisting fear and was slicing me up.  Luckily he got 
to wimpy point from my DoT not long after and I just bashed on him and 
refreshed the DoT till he died.
