I have too. Used to be trivial to put together a 50s ldon during my play 
time (my regular group is currently an enc/sk/clr, so we can take just 
about anybody... and there used to be 3-6 people lfg we could take, but 
now thats down to 1-2 (and at least one of them is in the bazaar on 
trader and forgot to take his lfg tag off).

I've also seen record lows in the PoK. Probably 20% off what it used to 
be.

Some people have reported bazaar numbers are actually up... i wonder if 
people are just running traders while they play EQ2/WoW... since the 
subscriptions aren't up yet, just in case they decide to come back.
