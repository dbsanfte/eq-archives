My brother came up with what I thought was a fantastic idea on the
alpha system (we also happen to be on Ayonae Ro).  Instead of
starting with the first person in the alphabet, random to see who goes
first and alpha from there.  This way everyone has a chance at starting
the chain.
Its just one of those ideas you slap your forehead and say 'duh' :-)
