Theoreticly the WMBS outdamage Windblade.  In actual play, if you are
tanking and/or casting frequently during melee*, Windblade often parses
out as more damage.  What you failed to mention is the WMBS primary
advantage over Windblade, anamely that the WMBS has not the slightest
similarity in appearance to a tennis racket.  ;)

[*] For any who don't know, hybrid casters get a small advantage vs.
pure caster when casting during melee.  Their melee timer is not reset
on a successful cast.  This means that with fast-cast spells and a slow
weapon you will suffer only a relatively small loss of DPS to casting
during melee.

As long as I'm breaking off my attempt to hijack the thread and
addressing the OP's intended question... there's a (usually) very cheap
26/22 2h piercer (can't for the life of me remember its name) that
does acceptable damage and gets you your skill-ups fast.
