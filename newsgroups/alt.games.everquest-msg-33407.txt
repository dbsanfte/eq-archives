Also,  If you are still over heavy,  Look into dropping AC for str think
1pt ac=3 pts str for a ranger who is always encumbered.  Avoid anything
that has AGI.  You should already be +100 and with kitty feet... you'll
be well off.  I'm also wearing a black iron crown 5ac +5(almost
everything)  Black alloy crown is 6ac +6(etc)  May be worth looking
into.  Definitely though get the bands. ac in finger/ear slots +str is
Excellant
