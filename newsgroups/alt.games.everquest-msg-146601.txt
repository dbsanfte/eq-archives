Agreed, its not a pet in the traditional sense.  But at 180 mana,
its a nice DOT on any long lived mob, and I think (someone parse
this out quick?) one that does more damage per minute
than the shaman pets.

If it was persistant it would be much much better than it is,
because I could slap  Aego on it to make up for its appalling
lack of HP, and get other buffs put on by other party  members.
As it stands, HP buffing it is nearly useless (I do slap a free
Valor on it in some circumstances) and getting party members
to blow mana buffing it up isn't a common occurrance.
