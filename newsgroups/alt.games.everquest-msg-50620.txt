Or take a look at Gator Scale arms and legs.
When i was doing tailoring and spend WAY too many hours in UGuk camping spiders, i
saw Ancient Croc uncamped for a total of 10 sec.

Went to Guk recently to get my new chanter some Int gear. Noone on AC, so grabbed
it. Got arms and legs in 5 hours, and in that time, i saw 2 people asking if AC
was camped. I was alone in Guk for a total of 2 hours that day.
In NFP someone is looking for Gator legs, and since my chatner dont need wis, and
my troll shaman friend didnt fancy being called Diaper Boy i had nothing better to
do with them. Remembering how i bought my own for 400pp 4 months before, i ask
what the going price is. Turns out it 600pp, so i make a nice profit.

Next day i head for Guk again, want a Shimmering Orb for my chanter too. Am alone
in Guk around 3 hours total, get 4 Bracelet of Woven Grass, no orb.
Head down the next day, AC uncamped 3 hours again, get 3 more bracelets, no Orb,
but get one from guild buddy.
Consider giving the bracelets away, must be worthless since a level 39 druid can
get 6 in 10 hours. Turns out noone bother to hunt them no more, and i can sell
them for 75-100pp each.
