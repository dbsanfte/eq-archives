It's been a while since i played, but i suspected they hated druids ever since i found a mass of very green mobs that 
could summon and kill me by generating mass interrupts. Like being pecked to death by pigeons, only less fun. Gating 
into GoD with my new spell was interesting too... something big aggroed, i ran, it summoned, rinse, repeat, then it 
killed me and the awful thing was, it was blue and wasn't even a named mob.

I quit soon after that.

But there's always been someone there who hated druids. Why make wolf form kos in halas and other cities? If it was 
because animals were seen as enemies, surely wolf form would be kos everywhere! It wasn't wolves that were hated, it was 
druids.
