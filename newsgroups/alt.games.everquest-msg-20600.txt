Try the Bearskin Potion bags in which a Shaman can combine potions.
Only small items I think but it has 10 slots and is pretty light. I use it
for just about anything that can fit in it (words, runes, gems, etc)

Also I had tells from several monks to buy some summoned bags from me. 100%
weight red and a weight of 0.1. Just too bad they're no rent :)
