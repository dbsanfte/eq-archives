I have 2 pcs, and have picked up my 2nd copy of everquest cos I fancy
trying to play 2 chars at once (mainly using my second char as a bot.)

Is this frowned upon, or is it an accepted way of playing?

What class combos would be a good mix for my main char and my bot
char?

I currently have a low level half-elf ranger. I love using bows but
apart from that am kind of going off rangers. I reckon that if I'm
botting I can solo real well without resorting to this very halfway
house hybrid class.

Cheers,
