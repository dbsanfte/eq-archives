From the lowliest wizard froggy in Guk to the red-con trash mobs in
Anguish...  There aren't many people that can claim to have stepped foot in
every zone in the game, but I'm one.  The dispel behavior never changes.  =)

Except that when (and this applies to "d" below as well) I actually get
buffed after a rez without asking, so that I don't have the opportunity to
make sure that my buffs get set up in the right order, I can count on asking
for those buffs that land in my top slots again after my first dispel.

Quite possible.  Anecdotally unlikely, however.  The admonition to raids to
"get clickies up top" before dispelling targets throughout the eras suggests
that the behavior is as it always has been.  Personal experience listening
to the people who complain about, using a current dispelling target of mine
as an example, Ture, and the personal experience of listening to those
people (including me) who laugh at them for not having clickies to deal with
it, suggests likewise.

I can count on the same behavior from mobs in DoN missions who cast
single-target annul magic as well.  I *always* keep junk buffs on top, even
while grinding.  Being the default puller 99.9% of the time leads to certain
habits.  =)

See above for a related response.

I have had instances where buffs seemed to get dispelled out of order.  The
unique thing about those instances though, when I had the opportunity to do
so, if I buffed in such a way that my junk buffs landed in those slots, from
then on (until I zoned) I would lose those slots first with every dispel. 
It was as though my buff slots had been shuffled up.  And when I zoned out,
assuming I didn't manage to die to accomplish zoning, my buffs would end up
rearranged, and, you guessed it, those would be my top slots.

I'm not sure what would cause such a thing, though it does seem to happen
after being killed once or twice in the same zone.  It's rare for me, and
not the easiest thing to test with any sort of scientific process.
