If you think that porting is an important discriminating ability (not sure
that's the right phrase but I'll go with it) of a druid then you're playing
it wrong.  What separates druids from every other casting class is that THEY
CAN DO IT ALL.  Let's see clerics, enchanters or mages snare/sow.  Let's see
shaman do serious DD damage, snare or damage shield.  Let's see wizards do
ANYTHING but nuke (though they can snare, it's a really sucky spell).

Porting is only a small part of being a druid.  It's simply the most
obvious.  Take that away and the REAL benefits of druids will shine.
