Note: a person in the group can open the loot window here and prevent
anyone from looting till he releases it.  During the stage one, even if he
releases it only other group members can loot.

substage: for some time, that person "holding" the body prevents
looting.  When he releases it, the next person to click it gets to loot.

Latter half substage: after some time the person holding the body
gets kicked off it.  Still several minutes left.  He could put it back
on hold if he wanted.

Deliberately circumventing hold by standing on the body and
chain clicking in the hopes of beating the designated looter
or stopping the holder from reapplying hold is ninja looting
and reprehensible if not soulmarkable.

Unheld bodies left lying around unattended, on the other hand,
haven't much claim on them, as I said in my other post.
