It does affect it, but only negligibly. I tend to throw STR buffs at
tanks to shut them up since they're usually quite cheap to cast, but it
doesn't really have much bearing on combat - only really useful if
you're encumbered and need to run. Ask any warrior playing towards the
end-game what stat they threw their ability points in at character
creation and they'll generally have maxed out Stamina over Strength.
