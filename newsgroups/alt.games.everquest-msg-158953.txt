I play on Vallon Zek, and my personal experience only applies to that
server, and its Team PvP rules, but Lance is actually correct. If ANYTHING
other than a Mob kills you then you take a no-exp-loss death. This even
applies to if a Mob dots you and you die to the dot, no exp death.  Its a
common tactic ( one Ive used myself ) to just pull a HP item when your in a
no win situation and are going to be killed anyways. Of course this only
works at lower levels where things arent hitting you for huge amounts of
damage.
