Well... the -simpler- cultural stuff (ie, the old recipes that are still 
in-game from before the May 8th tradeskill patch) don't involve any BDs.  
But you still gotta be pretty well off to get high enough in smithing to 
need Brellium for anything.  Either that, or willing to invest enough time 
that you coulda levelled your own enchanter...
