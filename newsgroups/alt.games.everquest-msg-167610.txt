Yep, now let us move down to #'s 6 and 7, which correspond to your
usage much more closely than #1:

"6.
    a. Something that is due to a person or governmental body by law, 
tradition, or nature.
    b. Something, especially humane treatment, claimed to be due to 
animals by moral principle

7. A just or legal claim or title."

Funny how these definitions presume a great deal weightier authority
than "an eccentric railgun toting kitty-kat".

All you've demonstrated here is your propensity for selective reading.
Or were you home with the sniffles that day in fourth grade when it
was explained that the way to use multiple definitions in a dictionary
is to find the one(s) that most closely match the context in which the
word was placed?

You are not personally in any position to grant global "rights" in EQ.
On the other hand SOE, which is in precisely that position, has taken
care not to grant the "right" which you wish to bestow.  The "right"
of which you spoke does <not> exist.  It never has existed.  And there
is no consensus among the player population that would establish such
a right by custom, per the general consensus about "camping".  In other
words, you're full of shit, which has become such a commonplace recently
that I no longer see any reason to waste my time reading your pathetic
drivel.
