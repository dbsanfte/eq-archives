LOL on my Voodoo 3 computer it was kinda stuttery (frame rate slower than
I'd ever gotten in Kelethin) so I thought "hmm, lemme turn mip mapping on,
just for the hell of it" (I'm a computer geek but not a video card geek).
Bad move...logged back in and graphics were just plain horrible...all text
were white blocks, NPCs weren't dressed.  Couldn't figure out which line in
EQCLIENT.INI (if any) I could change to turn off mip, so I just renamed it
and went back into the game to let EQ create a new one.  Things were back to
normal, but not that great.
