Nope, thats not what I mean.  I mean that the C64 was more user 
friendly, faster, more fun... better for me, as an end user, than the 
same era mac products.    Too, the C64 was better than the 286 DOS 
machine I migrated to in many of the same ways.

I would imagine that Amiga was probably better than the C64 and Mac and 
DOS machines... but I refused to try it out because the Commodore people 
  had, in my opinion, dropped the ball by not making Amiga (and before 
that the C128) backwards compatible, while the DOS people were dedicated 
to backwards compatibility.

This was roughly 8 years after I'd abandoned the C64, and I don't have 
any direct experience of the Mac systems since then.  Like Amiga, I have 
only my early experiences on the Mac and Fat Mac etc plus what I've 
heard people say.

Technology wise, though, in my opinion, isn't the entire point, you have 
to consider what the design was like in terms of ease of use, fun, 
beauty... some of which things that Bill Gates publicly stated were not 
important for quite a while.

I define it not in terms of "has the most market share" but rather "has 
the most software and hardware available for me to choose from.  You 
could create the finest piece of hardware/OS on the planet, but if the 
only software that would run on it was a web capable toast monitor, 
while crappy old windows XP had about 5000 pieces of software of every 
stripe (which it pretty much does now), then I as a user would go with 
windows.  I've never been excited about DOS or windows, but I have been 
happy that I picked the route that had the widest support, by a very 
wide margin.

I agree, but I think I can see why stores prefer the platforms.  There 
are so many different PC configurations that sometimes getting software 
to run on them all is an arcane art.  This means people buy games and 
return them, unsatisfied.  Playstation games only have to run on a 
Playstation, its much easier to get that right, which means the games 
have a larger tendancy to not be messed up on release.

Same is true of the end user; buy a game for a PC and it will very 
likely not work, these days; you pretty much have to wait for a patch, 
as games are pushed out the door to let the initial buyers do the beta 
testing.  At that its not as bad as it once was, remember the days of 
rewriting your autoexec.bat every time something came out, in order to 
tweak things to where it would run?  Ick!

I insist that my kids play on their computers, rather than giving in and 
buying XBox or something because I think that A) the games are better in 
general, but also B) because struggling with the computers to get them 
running is more educational!
