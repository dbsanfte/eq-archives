No snares, No evacs, No sows. hrm
Fantastic group for fighting non-fleeing mobs at a zoneline.
A lot of places would be out with this group. Dungeons in particular,
without snare and evac.
Outdoor would be inconvenient without sow. Potions are ok if youre a twink.

Give the monk jboots, and this is a good outdoor group.
