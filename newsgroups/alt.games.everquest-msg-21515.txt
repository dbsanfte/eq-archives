The best, fastest, cleanest, and most customizable newsreader I have found 
is http://xnews.3dnews.net/

It is fully functional, completely customizable, supports a regular 
expression scoring system that makes killfiling spam and such a breeze (I 
don't see viagra spam or V,I.A'G;R-A spam anymore), and it weighs in at under a meg or so.

I have used: Netscape, OE, Agent, FreeAgent, Gravity, slrn, tin, trn, and a 
bunch of others- XNews is by far the best.
