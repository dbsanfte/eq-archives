I don't know about this, but I am looking into it.

Not sure what you mean here, when I write or reply, I don't have 10 options 
listed. All my stuff is already filled out except the subject if it is a 
new message.

I use Xnews in preview mode, the "follow-up to newsgroup" button is just 
above the previewed message. Or if you want it quicker, with the message 
open, just hit "f" to reply to the selected newsgroup, or "m" to reply by 
mail.
