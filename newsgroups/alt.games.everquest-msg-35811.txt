Movement on X, Y doesn't affect casting.  What affects casting is having
a different X, Y when the casting finishes than when it starts.  So, you
can move all you want, as long as you get back to the starting point
when the casting finishes.  This is why people who try to interrupt
casting by running around in a room sometimes fail: they accidently end
up at the same spot they started from!

Actually, there is also at least once situation in which you can move to a
different X, Y and have casting work.  If you start casting a spell, and
then run onto a boat, the spell works.  This is fun with "minor
illusion".  E.g., start casting on the Qeynos dock and run onto the
boat.  Minor Illusion then turns you into a wooden post and beam with a
fish hanging on you, on the deck of the boat.
