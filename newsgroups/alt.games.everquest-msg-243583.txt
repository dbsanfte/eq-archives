Can't speak for every server, but on Torv, the places to go for groups is
either HHK in the basement doing gobbies or the SF ramp in OT...  

In the olden days *waxes nostalgiac (and mutilates that spelling)* Split Paw
was the place to go... but that zone is a Ghost Town these days...  :(  

Again, that is just on Torv.  May be completely different on other servers.
