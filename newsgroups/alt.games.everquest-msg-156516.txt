Yes, EQ is multiplayer for a reason.  One reason is that I can interact with
my guildies in guildchat, make friends, and solo my characters if I so
choose.

It's all about what you want to get out of the game.  If you enjoy grouping,
more power to you.  If you enjoy soloing, more power to you.  I can be as
social as a player who groups every time they play, and I'm not as reliant
on other folks to enhance my gaming session.  Many times I'll see folks go
into someplace LFG, then in a few minutes I'll see a /ooc "I can't believe
no one needs a chanter!", and end up /ooc "Well, if no one needs a chanter,
I guess I'll camp" ... playing, without gaming.  To me, that's not having a
good time ... I logged to play, not ask other people if I can play.

In the 2 years or so I've played, I've had more bad experiences than good
with pick-up groups.  Due to this, if I group at all it's either with my
guild or a few RL friends, generally speaking.  But again, if you like
pick-up groups and have had nothing but great experiences with them, more
power to you ... I'm glad for you.

In fact, I find I pay closer attention to guildchat when soloing.  When
grouping, I have to focus on the group's needs ... and I end up minimizing
my guildchat window.  When soloing, I easily get into the flow of the
night's conversation in guildchat, crack a few one-liners, and have a great
time.

btw ... the whole "If you don't do <insert activity here> exactly the way I
do then you're a moron" attitude stinks.
