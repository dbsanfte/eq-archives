Ok ill try and explain it in simple terms. I would really like to see the
classes balanced in overall desiredness. I like Eq even though it has some
really serious flaws , if they can repair the flaws more people may come
play or more people may come back from other games. If more people show up
the game I like has a good chance of lasting a long time and perhaps even
getting better.
