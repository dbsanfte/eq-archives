If that is truly the case then I will have no problem with EQ's next
expansion with my GeForce 4 TI 4600. Moved ALL the options up to Very High,
and the landscape and the mobs ( people in this case ) moved smoothly
without any jitters at all. Dont have a frame rate measurement tool so I
cant give you any benchmarks there, just what I saw in-game.

And what I saw looked VERY nice...  Theyve especially done a good job with
the water it looks like :)
