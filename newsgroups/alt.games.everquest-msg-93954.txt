Only thing you've missed is good one liners to reply with when the tank
keeps screaming for me to stop taunting and i haven't touched it ;) j/k.
As for snare, I'm finding the new luclin one to be a huge help, I usually
wait till the mob is at 1/3 hp left to cast my snare and if in a fast
killing group if it's resisted I can pull out the tangling weeds, kind of a
crappy snare (won't call it a root since the mobs don't keep fighting when
this is cast on them) but it's insta-cast and our regular spell can
overwrite it. So just as a note to any ranger's who filed it as a junk spell
it does have a use lol.
The distance part caught me, I thought that unless the mob was rooted it
wouldn't matter how close i was so I never gave a second thought to standing
a bit in front of the army of ogre's barb's and troll's to fight, that tip
should turn out to be really helpful thankyou =) (I'll just be sure to tell
them to spread their legs a bit for me to peek under or find me a log to
stand on so I can see what i'm hitting =p)
