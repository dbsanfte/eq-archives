When were rangers last nerfed?

> take away the only skill they are better than any other classes at.

They can buff +ATK better than any other class
They are better trackers than any other class.
They are better outdoor pullers than any other class
They have the best invuln disc (better than monks, warriors, rogues etc
anyway.. I dunno about versus DA)
They have the joint best (debatable) spell in the game : ensnare
(ok very debatable now) They have the best slow of melees
