Experimentally, I've found that 30 seconds is not too short.  I get the
same speed measured over 4 second runs, 10 second runs, 30 second runs,
and 2 minute runs.

This is not the same as using a stopwatch to measure the time between
two known points, where you have error from your reaction time.  I hit
the stopwatch with hand while hitting the /loc hotkey with the other.

If you are a caster, you can make things easier by casting "True North"
before testing, so getting distance is then just a single subtraction.
