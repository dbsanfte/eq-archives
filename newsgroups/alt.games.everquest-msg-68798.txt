okay, so appearantly my system just cannot run in luclin, because the poly
count is just so much more, accolades to the everquest team for making on
adding to a great game.

Went and tried out DAOC and developed a char named saverlous towers to 22nd
level, figure that is high enough for him.  not interested in playing any
more on him.

Went and tried to go into luclin to buy the new spells stupidly, and now my
57th enchanter is trapped in luclin with no way out.  ROFL  Appearantly
those spells are now available on all vendors.

few questions regarding luclin since haven't been able to try it out.   What
is the ratio of getting a level vs the new general skill of 1?  for this
question, lets look at it from 100 % in one to 100 % to another.  is it a
1:1 ratio?

another concern / question, if they completely do away with the current
system or change the skills based on balance issues later, after all that
time and energy of building up something and thinking it was something to
find it wasn't, will they be able to hit some button or not for a limited
time after the change to let some people who don't like those changes to
redo all those training points based on the new system?
Essentially when developing the new training skills, are we totally subject
to the whims of them deciding balance issues, or those who put points in
them; or will we be allowed to redirect those points later?

personally I think the general and then next one is pretty good, but the
class specific skills will take so / so much effort depending on ratio,
hoping (seriously hoping) that those will be allow you to be redirected back
to original if they make any changes to that specific class.

Allowing an enchanter extra buffs of 50 % for roughly the cost of 25 to 50
more levels exp seems very / very powerful.  allowing new metals would rule,
but appearantly that has balance issues with it?  Luclinite?  nope.  maybe
it will be added in the future.  I hope so.

so why bother to train in the highest level of making jewelry in the new
system in luclin if they don't add it, at least in my case, where I have
more plat than I know what to do with.

would be nice to be able to buy some property for like 500 K plat or 1 mil K
plat or even more.  I guess horses is like their idea of property, come to
think of it.   ROFL  guess I'm a cheapstake, not interested in buying the
horse, even though it is useful.    maybe I should fork over the cash.  of
course I would buy the best, since I never bothered to get the either of
the SOW boots.
