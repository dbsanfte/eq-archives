Heh, guess I'm lucky I've been playing mostly alts since the patch!

Not just that, but because the client thought the cast was instant,
it didn't bother showing a Casting Time window, making it a lot
harder to judge when the spell would go off (so that you can start
moving, switch gear, etc.).  And on long-casting spells the audio
often runs out long before the spell finishes, and you had to read
the log window to see if the spell has finished yet.
