I'm not pointing fingers, nor do I want to engage in some sort of crazed red
herring fest.  I just wonder how many folks (not just here, but in guilds
and such) protest vociferously against such a thing but in actuality have
been a client of IGE or some such.

And, given that, would vote the opposite of their protestations in the above
mentioned poll.

Also, I wonder if the poll is really going to change SOE's direction.  Call
me cynical, but I somehow doubt it.
