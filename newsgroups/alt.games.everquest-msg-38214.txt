Up until recently, I've been having good luck with @home in terms of lag.  A
few weeks ago, though, something has happened to the link between me and
Verant, and it hasn't been fixed yet.  I play on Bertoxx, and whenever I LD,
which is often, I run a tracert to the IP to see what's up.  Results this
morning are no different than any other time.  The 7th hop is hosed:

Tracing route to eqworld-19.989studios.com [192.215.37.46]
over a maximum of 30 hops:

I am really getting pissed since I'm missing out on a lot of raids and such
as well as dying routinely due to lag.  My connect will be fine then all of
a sudden BAM 90% PL.  I'm in Oregon and I was wondering if anyone else on
the west coast with @home has been lagging as much as me.  My guess is if
you're in my area you probably have.
