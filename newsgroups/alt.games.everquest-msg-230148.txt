Sarnak Fort is good and I believe you can also start to enter The Crypt of
Dalnir in WW which is very good xp and some decent loot to sell, if even to
the vendors.   You can usually sit right inside the entrance of the crypt
and pick off the two roamers (i think on 15-20 min spawn) and then pull from
deeper. It's not too busy, at least on my server, and very safe as you are
next to a zone line.  This is a common place for most of the characters I
start when they are 27-34.  Depending on your class, and if you can invis,
you can spend several levels here by just dropping down a floor into a new
range of mobs...with there being a zone out on each floor that puts you
right back outside the first floor entrance.

Good Luck, Have fun :)
