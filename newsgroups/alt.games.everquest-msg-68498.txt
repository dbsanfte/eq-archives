I don't know, I had no trouble getting an Enstill cast through being beat on
by two Drolvarg Ragers in DL when I was level 39 or so, and they were high
blue to white to me, of course it would have been a lot more effective if I
hadn't still had myself targetted when I cast. =P

Needless to say, I was quickly beaten to a pulp and died.  However, had I
had the right target...  I was still sowed too, of course, so, if all else
had failed, I would have just zoned it.  I was planning on root parking one,
and bringing the other over to a group of friends I was joining.
