But RPG's such as AD&D where spell slots go up your required to mem a
particular spell many times if you want to use it many times. For example, 4
magic missiles, 2 fireballs, 1 web, 1 invis, and 1 gate. Once you cast them,
the powers that be wipe it from your mind till you pray/mem more spells.

     When I was a GM I used a system similar to EQ in that I would let a
character pick 10 spells from all the ones in his spell book each morning.
Those would be the spells that he could cast for as long as he had the mana,
which was based on either Intelligence or Wisdom dependant on Priest or Mage.
    So really, I don't know ANy game where youc an have an unlimited amount of
casts. Even Elminster the great has to memorize spells from a book.
