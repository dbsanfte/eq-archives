Max damage of the pet is its native max damage or twice the
listed damage of the weapon. Delay is ALWAYS 30.  Thus
you could just as easily give Jaboober a 37/150 weapon as
a 37/10 weapon, and unless there's some reason that noone
will ever be able to weild the 37/10, you'd be a fool to do
the latter.

Is AotKK lore no drop or something like that making it impossible
to sell?

I seem to recall a 50/150 weapon that's usable only by large
races, making it useless (terrible delay for a real tank, and
not weildable by normal pets) that might be excellent in the
hands of a dire charmed giant, though, drop in the giant
fort in FM
