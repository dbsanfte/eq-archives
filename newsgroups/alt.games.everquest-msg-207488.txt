Folks I know this question has been asked many times in the past but I need
some  up to date advice. 

Background:  I'm running a P4 1.5gig, 512 mewg RAM VIO with the stock TNT or
whatever NVIDEA sp) graphics card.  Well it was marginal even while on a cable
modem. I recently moved to an RF black hole and now on a dial up modem that
will occasionll connect at a blazing 32kb.

I recall a few years back some advice here that a an upper end praphics card
would definatrely help my situation,  greatly reduce lag etc.  Is this true? 
Whata cards would you recommend?  Or am I simply screwed and should relax and
just play in non  laggy zones  EC, NRO  the Karanas  etc with low level
characters. As matters presently stand I can;t play my 56 Druid. All he'd do is
 reverse level with the  Lag and LD monster biting him in the butt.

Thanks in advance for the advice.

David N.
