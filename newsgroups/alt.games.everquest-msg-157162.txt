1 Zone (Plane of Knowledge) with free teleports to all major cities.
That is a HUGE reason to buy the expansion.

Well they are in this business to make money. You couldn't level past
50 without Kunark (or was it Velious?). You can't play a Beastlord (or
a Vah Shir) without Luclin. You can't use the Bazaar without Luclin.

You must be new to EQ. Players have always had to pony up money for
the expansions if they wanted to use the new features.
