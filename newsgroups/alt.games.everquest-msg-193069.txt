The only really big difference is that some items in Diablo can take
up multiple inventory spaces, and there were no containers that I can
remember.

On a different note, the inventory system of UO drove me mad. Not
being a particularily organized person, finding something in a pack
could be maddening. It was kinda cool tho that you could nest your
packs, but this also added to the chaos.
