I wish. Maybe with really green mobs that don't give exp. In my experience,
a pet can only solo a blue mob with appropriate buffs and heals without
severe risk of death to the mage. This costs mana, which needs to be
regen'ed, which means sitting on your tush medding.

Besides it's no fun to be a pet's cleric. Blasting away with nukes is what's
fun to me about playing a mage. I'm certainly not the best mage in the world
but my most efficient kill ratio at level 35 soloing high blues is only 2
per 10 minutes with medding. Easily noticed because Burnout II only lasts
ten minutes and in that time I can kill, med, kill, med back to full, before
I have to recast BOII. This is also with spells not being resisted thus
causing more mana to be used.
