I dont think the guild that tried it one day only to see it despawn too
soon, then tried it like the very next day really expected SOE to itemize it
by then.  They had the choice to wait till the next patch to try again when
there would have been a possibility of loot.  Instead they chose to rush
back there knowing that there was almost zero possibility of getting loot.
They expected no loot.
