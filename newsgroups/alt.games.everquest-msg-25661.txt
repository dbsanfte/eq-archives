I didnt see anyone say you were pestering them?  and you did complain about
he price... the point you made was the price was HIGH.  Well he was going to
have to abandon his camp.... and 50 was his price...  That is the point you
keep missing...

Agreed it is the casters choice to leave and his/her choice on what they
want to charge...
I usualy see 10 plat per passenger... but I have paid in excess of 40 plat
if my needs are high enough.... (were your needs high enough... guess enough
to complain about it)

Agreed it is a multiplayer environment, but I only get so much time to
play... so sometimes I have to think of numero uno... and others eh its a
whim.

I see that you were nice as you have stated.... but your complaint about the
price seems unjustified by several... (does not mean you are wrong,
but.....)


Hunt well... Be merry.... Blessed Be
