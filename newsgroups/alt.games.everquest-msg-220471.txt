I was modifying my UI files the other day, and am still appalled that
so much XML code for EQ is undocumented.

When I use Visual Studio .Net, I always document my style sheet, and I
turn off the visual designer when I have the basic layout of a page and
use code view and document that code as well.  Of course, it requires
a bit of exra work because VS.Net's designer writes the WORST code you
have ever seen.
