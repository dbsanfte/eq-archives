I remember seeing that message split-pulling with my monk in Kael way
back when. Of course I had to wait until after I had "Ranger-Gated" to
see it :-P

You really don't need that kind of "tanking" until you hit 50+ (or 46+
if you count planes). 

With the gear available today, the Knights and Hybrids can function
extremely well as "tanks" in exp groups. Especially if you stick to
oldworld zones (mobs with less HPs that hit for less damage)

In the case of a Bard/Shaman duo (slow songs/spells stack), you can
turn mobs into complete gimps that even a *bard could tank :-P

*No offense to bards...It's just that the class is more caster than
tank despite the ability to wear plate.
