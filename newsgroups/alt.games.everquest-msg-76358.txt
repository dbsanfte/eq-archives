Yup...as soon as I saw "plz" I knew where it went.

BTW, "plz" or not, I'll port anyone anywhere for ONE HQ bear.

Rivervale is where 29+ druids go to do most of their banking/selling.  It's
also where the most pain-in-the-ass beggars hang out.  You don't qualify for
that (not even close) but my druid has learned to tune out all oocs when I'm
in that zone.

Ya know, it's a shame you can't filter chat by zone. :)   I'd love to be
able to turn off auction in EC while leaving it on in every other zone, for
example.
