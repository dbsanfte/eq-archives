The problem is liking the game up to level 10 is no guide to liking the game 
at high levels.
You can solo up to level 10.
At high levels, soloing isnt really an option (technically posible for some 
classes perhaps), and the game is all about raiding with large guilds 
(typically 40+)

Most of us left EQ when WOW came out, and the few that remain tend to be the 
elite hard core raiders. SOE killed it for the casual gamer years ago. 
Unless your'e hard core and willing to play a lot of catch up, Id avoid EQ 
like the plague.

dont believe the fanbois.
