Most likely it was another one of Avenger's failed attempts
at gaining popularity.

Notice how quick he was to answer posts in it?

This basically proves a bizbee point that perhaps he is
crazy and feels a need to reassure himself.

What I really love are his "oh-so-intelligent" responses to
posts like "pussy". I don't know too many 43 year olds
that can spend an entire day posting that same comment
to a Newsgroup about an online game!
