As a clicky item addict (I think I carry 23 clickies atm) this has me pretty
excited, though I've never bothered with force feeding, I just eat my pies.

I think last time I did any instrument swapping on a regular basis was
switching between lute and horn while AE kiting in LoIo. Worn mods aren't
just for the uberguild bards anymore are they? Pretty much anyone can finish
the bard epic 1.0, and once that crappy ratio is beginning to diminish your
affection for your Singing Short Sword, there are more and easier to get worn
instrument mods than before, many of them buyable in bazaar. And yes, I am an
elitist "the game begins at 65" bastard (65 still, I don't expect everyone to
reach 70 immediately).

I do switch my Edge of Eternity in for the percussion mod sometimes for doing
AE resists or when I'm in solo DPS/tanking mode twisting DOTs while meleeing
for a staggering upwards 200 dps and more aggro than a beastlord who isn't
trying to get aggro, but then I keep it equipped the whole time, not just
when songs land.

Just to digress further, I've seen plenty of examples of people imo focussing
on the wrong aspects about playing a good bard.

It's not about twisting the most songs and juggling instruments. A couple of
more points of attack and DS from warsong isn't going to make or break a
group. The important thing is doing the right song at the right time and
knowing the game and your environment. 95% of the time you'll be at 95% of
your potential twisting just 3 songs, and in fact before the current bug with
anti-fizzle AA (they make you never ever miss a note at all ATM which isn't
intended) no one in their right mind would try to twist more than 3 songs
when one of them is vital, like resists.
