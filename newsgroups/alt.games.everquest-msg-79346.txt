I would get at least 2 more levels with the necro, and then do the gargs on 
Spec / Garg / Undead isle.  I did them until 21, and you can probably do 
them up to 23 or 24.

The Druid may be able to get EXP from the Sisters on the island where you 
jump off of the boat.

The pirate has an aggro range the size of Chicago.  I would think your 
necro and his pet would be able to take him.  The sisters on the island 
there considered my necro their ally, so I always jumped off the boat and 
immediately cast a pet.  If the pirate came running, I would kick his ass, 
then go on to Spec isle after killing a few sisters, looting the halberds, 
and selling the belts.

Get a healer partner for your Warrior and kill gargs, too.

On Garg island, there are 3 monsters that spawn there - gargs, some 
skellies, and specs.  The gargs and skellies are on an alternating spawn 
table.  If you kill a skelly, a garg will pop to replace it and vice-versa.  
They are KOS to each other and will fight, with the garg winning.  What 
this means is that if you get there and there are no gargs up, kill all the  
skellies, and sargs will pop.  If you are the only person there, the garg 
population will be fine and you won't have to kill any skellies after that, 
as the Gargs will take care of them for you.  If there is another group or 
soloer there, you may have to kill the skellies to keep the garg population 
up.

The garg eyes can sell for 8-9pp, I think.  Keep 1 or two in the bank for 
when a Mage needs one for his focus item (?).  I've replied to several 
/oocs where a mage is paying 30+pp for a garg eye.

Stay away from the Spectres.  They will kill you.  Dead.  IVU does work on 
them, however.  If you don't get close to them, you don't have to worry 
about them.  If there is a bard or druid kiting them, then politely tell 
him where you are camping and if he isn't an asshole, he will steer clear 
of you.

Once in a while, a Seafury will get on Spec Isle and get stuck there.  You 
may be able to find some nice high-level person in the zone to come get it 
off for you if you ask nicely.

If you want a free Pally-only Harpoon, go up to the lady in one of the 
buildings near the dock and say something like "where is xyrin?"  Xyrin 
will then pop on Spec isle.  Go over there and talk to her ( may not be 
necessary ).  After a while, she will charge the specs and just stand 
there.  For some reason, they don't kill her.  She will despawn after some 
time, and drop the harpoon.  Use IVU, go up, and pick it up.  Next time you 
take the boat to Burcherblock, sell or give it to a newbie Paladin around 
Kaladim.
