I guess you missed the part where he explained that this was due
to CPU limitations, and (contrary to your mischaracterization)
did NOT say that he thought things "should" act the way they do now.

...confirming once again that Brandon has a weird fixation on the
collision-avoidance issue, always using it as a springboard to
insult Verant and claim it's some sort of incompetence on their part,
despite the fact that people have explained to Brandon over and
over again the difficulty (or nigh impossibility) of doing real-time
collision detection on thousands of NPCs versus tens of thousands
of static objects, on hardware that doesn't cost so much money
that no one could possibly afford to play games on it.
