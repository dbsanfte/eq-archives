I never said everything from developers mouth's is bullshit. Sometimes it is
but that's staved with actual data next to it.
If you're given a conformation in october (from absor) that pet canni is not
an issue and 2 months later is nerfed to hell does raise some questions.

The sole reason for nerfing pet canni apparently is that it will be too
unbalanced in future expansions. That means new pets. Why didn't the change
come in when we actually got those new pets instead of nerfing 50+ soloing
and raiding dps for mages without compensation?
The 2 mana/tick is cute, but totally not in line with the nerf. Aside from
the act it won't stack with PoG/Bo9 it also starts at level 58 meaning it
screws mages lvl 50-57 AND the 2 mana/tick is abysmal small compared to the
roughly 20 / tick normal usage of the canni resulated in.


Also implementing it just a few days before christmas without other
compensation means mages will have to go through the holiday being just
kicked in the dirt. Nothing will be done before at least januari because
most developers are now on vacation. Great PR stunt. Really.
