 I seem to recall that when VP first opened the keys weren't soulbound
(reference 7/19/2000 patch message for the soulbound change) so yes, the
zone did have some corpse-eating potential at that time. I believe
Gordon or someone even posted saying that GMs would not help you
retrieve corpses from there. I tried to do news searches but I couldn't
find the actual articles. I believe people got around that by creating
similar key corpses like they did for ST in Velious since Verant didn't
learn anything from the past.

 So, to summarize: VP initially had "serious corpse-eating potential"
but that was severly diminshed by the creation of soulbound keys.
