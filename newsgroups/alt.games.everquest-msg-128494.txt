There's no hotkey or combination of hotkeys that will
work.

The easiest thing to do is just keep clicking on the
pile of mobs until you find one with 100% health
(if the tank has been hacking at his target for more
than a second or two, his mob's health will be
noticeably below 100%, even if it has only been
hit a few times).  Then mez it.

If there are more than two mobs in the pull,
repeat as necessary, ignoring any mob you target
which isn't itself swinging, since that's one of
the ones you've already mezzed (you can tell this
pretty easily by watching the highlighted/blinking
name of the mob you have targeted -- if it bobs
around a lot, the mob is swinging, if it's pretty
stationary or just slowly swaying back and forth,
the mob is mezzed).

Sometimes it's hard to target anything but the
mob closest to you if they're all piled up --
using F9 to get an overhead view of the crowd
makes it easier to pick different mobs at will.
