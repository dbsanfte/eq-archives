I've started wandering around the netherbian lair lately but the
greater lightstone I carry doesn't seem too effective. I noticed the
same thing when I went to paludal caverns, the place is nearly totally
dark and no matter what type of lightsource you carry it barely even
lights up even a small radius around you. I gave up on paludal after
about ten minutes and now I find netherbian lair is the same. I hope
not all zones are going to be extremely poorly lit like this.

I wish there was some kind of spell that would turn nighttime into
day. I really don't like wandering around with a near totally dark
screen. It may have looked good when they designed the game but when
you have to play all the time with a screen that you can hardly make
anything out..... I think i'd much rather be able to see :)
