I can understand many of the client-side exploits that have turned up 
before, because of performance requirements.

For example, speed hacks, or being able to see what loot a mob will 
drop, sort of make sense.  They've got hundreds or thousands of people 
on a server, and need real-time response, so they have to push some 
things that affect all those players to the client because the servers 
just aren't fast enough to handle that.

However, character creation is only happening on a few accounts at a 
time, and it does not need real-time response.  There's no reason for 
the server to have to trust the client on this.  If that's what they 
did, someone really botched the design.
