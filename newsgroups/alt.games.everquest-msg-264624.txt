Ah, thanks for that clarification.

Wards aren't that expensive in EQ2, there's a low level one that every 
Priest archetype gets and then the more powerful ones emerge as main staples 
in the Shaman class lineup. Shamans also get a special, no-time-to-cast, 
no-power-cost Eidolic Ward with a 30 minute recast timer. Saved our butts 
last night as the tank went down to a sliver fighting a double up-arrow 
orange named centaur and his two orange minions out in the Thundering 
Steppes. The named was almost dead, as were several of us, eveyone was OOP, 
and all I had left was my Eidolic Ward. Kept the tank alive, and it was some 
mighty nice loot.
