Just my opinion, but I think you should lighten up.  The proper response
would go something along the lines of, "Oh, he's just pissed off at life and
spouting his mouth off randomly to vent his frustration... I'll ignore him
until he calms the fuck down."  Well, I haven't quite calmed the fuck down,
it's a bit more than getting cut off in traffic that's got me hating
everybody and their mother... but you're kind of wasting your breath making
a giant moral lecture out of it.  If I was going around beating the shit out
of people you might have a point there, but... for Christ's sake, it's a
newsgroup.  And if I was really trying to just ruin the guy's day and make
him cry himself to sleep, I wouldn't have pointed out that I'm in a bad
mood, which somewhat explains why I was acting like that... but then maybe
I'm just an asshole, and you're right to blast me for it.  Unfortunately I'm
not in the mood to give a fuck.
