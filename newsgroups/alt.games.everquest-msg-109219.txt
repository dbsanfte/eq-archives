Well, I've suspected it before, but this is the first time I'm sure; Run
can save your hide

I was in a AR group, quite a distance in, working mind worms and aliens,
when my ISP
decided to take a nice AFK and dumped me.  Five minutes later, I logged
in to a dead
group (oddly, not my fault, they took out the mob they were on when I
left, and for some
reason decided to go ahead and pull some more while I was gone) and
instant aggro.  I hit
DA and ran madly for the exit, and the "invulnerable messages" started
going berserk
as I plowed thru add  after add.  Then they started dying down a bit as
I moved thru some
unoccupied running room, and DA dropped.  I just kept running, nothing
hitting me for
a few seconds, till a new add (still mobs between me and zone) got a
stun on me.  I managed
to channel DB after two tries (and 90% of my health) while all those
mobs I was trailing
caught up to me.  Then I beat feet again for the exit, with the same
dying off of invulnerable
messages... DB dropped and I had still about 4 seconds to go, but
nothing hitting me at all.
Monk from the group was FD there and said I had about fifteen mobs
spread out close on my
tail....

One AA point on my whole brellblessed character, and its in Run.
Without that one point,
I'd have been creamed too hard to get DB up, or even -with- it up would
have run out
of life about a half second after DB dropped, still around the corner
and up the hall from
the finish line.

considering putting 10% in AA... cause Run 2 and 3 await!
