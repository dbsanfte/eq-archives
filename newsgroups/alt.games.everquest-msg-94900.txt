The GREATEST bard located my corpse after a horrible gruesome quick death.  He
died in the process.  His name was Playet Aginsam, or a variation.
We helped him get his level back within an hour, and made it very financially
worth his while.  
Don't always think there's a "price to pay"  for being helpful.  I still
remember him.  And it was a long time ago.......
