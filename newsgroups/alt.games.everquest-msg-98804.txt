Given this stuff was on Test Server for over a week, and the possible fact
that test server doesn't really get any changes other than code being
dumped to it to be tested by players who want to play with buggy stuff, as
mentioned in a post on another thread about accelerated food and water
consumption, I would think that yes...  It would have been noticed.

However, ever notice that a test server, controlled conditions, doesn't
always mimic real life?  As much as I hate to do this, let's look at one of
those JAG episodes...  The one where they wanted to blame a plane crash to
the pilot, when later they found out it was due to some electronics
hardware that got fubared from being banged around from doing carrier
traps.  Not many people do a lot a messed up things on Test Server, or the
situations on Test Server are the same as live servers, where there are
over 1k people playing at any given time.

From my own experience, programs currently out there do not do exactly what
you want it to do over the littlest things, and most programs are
programmed for the 'ideal' situation.  Live servers, for the most part, are
not going to be in the 'ideal' situation.  Random and unforseen glitches
may cause other things to happen because of the way it is set up or dealt
with.  Does it mean everything is going to go off smoothly?  No.

It's easy to criticize, and in Ken's case... He uses his network roll out
as an example for why testing should make things fool proof.  Being a Beta
Tester for some software, I can tell you...  That's comparing Apples to
Oranges.  Software revisions, no matter how hard you test, won't account
for everything, even when it goes live.
