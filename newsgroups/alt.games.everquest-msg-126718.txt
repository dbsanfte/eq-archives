Pretty sure there's never been a full p-wipe on test, but I could be
wrong. What I do know though, is that test has a VERY tight knit society
who are very (some say overly) protective of their server, much more so
than any other server.

Allegedly, our asses are either too tight to fit even the smallest bug
up, or already filled with a wide variety of human/animal appendages,
in-game items, and general household goods. Depends which flame you read
at the time, and whether it's bandwagon-jumpin' season.

EXP-loss-free and CR-free practice on new mobs/areas would be the common
high-end use, plus the influx of rep-free griefers, totally spoiling the
server

I agree it's a nice idea in practice, and if it were used in the
'spirit' it was meant to be used, it's be a great idea. Unfortunately
(as with many good ideas) the potential for negatives outweigh the
possible gain
