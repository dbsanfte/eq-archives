I was hanging around lesser fay, being pestered by equestrelle the corrupt,
so I figured this beast has to die. jeez. This mob runs off out of range
when im about to cast. I catch up to it and its stopped. Put a dot on it,
and it just sits there. After a little while it runs off again. I find
hasten on track, then my remaining ghaast hearts, so I didnt bother any more
with equestrelle. Extended spell range would be very usseful against a mob
that runs in and out of range like this. Personally I think if they are
gonna increase the intelligence off the mobs, then the intelligent mobs at
level 40 shouldnt be picking fights with a level 56. just my 2c.
