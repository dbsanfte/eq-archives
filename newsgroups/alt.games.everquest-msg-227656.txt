How about the simple and OBVIOUS fact that the rolls you're not
participating in ARE NOT THE ONES YOU WILL EQUIP AND USE.

Drill that through your thick skull.   I don't give a shit if I get an item
to sell or not.  I only care if I get an item that is an upgrade, because
*that* is where the fun in looting comes from for me.

Your chances of looting AN UPGRADE are one sixth as high as if it was a NBG
group.   Period.   End of story.
