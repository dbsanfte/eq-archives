I posted a few days back how I was disappointed with the crafting
system, until I was informed how to use the crafting buffs.

Don't wait for a problem to occur to use a buff, use them all the
time. Read about what each one does and use it accordingly. If one
says increases your progress & decreases power, use it all the time
while you craft. Others might say increases durability, use them if
your green bar is getting low and threatening to lose a level of
quality.

My crafting has improved dramatically since I started using the buffs
all the time. I went from creating pristine items about 1 in 5 to
about 9 out of 10.

One thing I have noticed is there seems to be no buff to increase
durability for light armoring (leather). Makes it hard to get pristine
items.

Cheers,
