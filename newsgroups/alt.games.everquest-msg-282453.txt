Hey Don, 

This should help you with what you want:

As for the Hotbutton bar:

In the UI folders, make your own folder. ie: Mine

I copied over the EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml file to the Mine folder from
the Old Default folder. 

Look through Old Default folder and there's several tga files to do
with the spell icons. Copy those over to the Mine folder as well.

The files I copied over so I could still have the old spell gems
with the new UI:

gemicons01.tga
gemicons02.tga
gemicons03.tga
spells01.tga - spells07.tga

In game, /loadskin mine 1

You'll now basically have the new UI with the 2 X 5 Hotbutton bar and
the old spell icons.

No problem.  Unless they change the Hotbutton boxes again, you should
be all set.
