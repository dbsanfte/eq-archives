Just out of curiosity, which would you rather have?

1. 1,000,000pp

or

2. $100 U.S. Currency

There is no wrong answer.  I'm guessing everyone's individual answer
to this one would depend on their RL situation.  Or, I guess for some
people this answer would depend on their plat situation in Everquest. 
As I said, I am just curious.
