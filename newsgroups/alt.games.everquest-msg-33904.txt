My first experimental Bard character was a mule I named Elfvis.  He had the
Half-Elf male face graphic who has the curly lock of hair over his forehead.

When wearing patchwork armor, he looked like he was in rhinestones.

Then I started having fun with him.... made hotkeys where I made him sing
and dance at the same time.  You should have seen his hips sway as he sung,
"You Ain't Nothin' but a Gnoll Pup" at the Qeynos gates.

He was popular.  People applauded, laughed, and gave him FS weapons, money,
and bronze armor (no begging...just gifts out of the blue.)  I actually used
him to twink one of my higher level characters after one particularly
successful concert.

It was the funnest character I ever had.

By level 5, the GM's caught up with me.....
