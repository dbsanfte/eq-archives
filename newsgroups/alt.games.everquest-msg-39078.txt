    So, right-clickable item with "Aura of the Horse X" on it: X indicating
how fast you are, and the other part of the effect being the "player race on
a horse" illusion. It'll be interesting to see if it DOESN'T work like this,
if being "on horseback" effects factions like illusions can, if being on
horseback will stack with SoW, etc. Other than that, well, big whoop. Not
much different from TBoots.

    No kidding. No more snare-kiting for you, not that that was the best way
of doing it anyways. Would hurt necromancers, though. And might cause issues
in dungeons, depending on where the changes were done.

    One must assume skilled = high level. So sounds like the best horses
will be moving at a pretty strong clip.

    Then it would stand to reason that no horse would outrun someone with
TBoots. From your comment above, the best horses will outrun TBoots. As for
a mistake in "upping speeds", I'd guess that the NEW mobs in SoL will have
enhanced speeds and the old-world mobs will remain the same.
