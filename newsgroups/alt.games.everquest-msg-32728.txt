    I've seen something about this before but it was a while ago and haven't
heard of it much.  But do guilds or any organization of players ever get
many LV1s together and do a massive raid on a city they'd be KOS to?
    What about raided a city, killing all NPCs or at least all guards? Or
even just something like wipe out a clean path from Iksar city to the boat
and raid Qeynos or Freeport, many many LV1s running in there (naked of
course) just for a massive attack, see how many survive (imagine LAG!)?  Any
recent or common races of LV1s storming a city that they're KOS to?  It
would be VERY hard and may take the support of a VERY large guild to clear
the way, but LV1 Ogre raid of Qeynos.  I guess with the support of enough
druids, wizards, and anybody who can teleport, invis, and SoW, (see invis
would also be wanted), it could be done without having to wipe any zones
clean of mobs.
    Oggok doesn't have many NPCs.  What about a rival race/class such as
high elves or gnomes and halflings and elves (little snacks...or...races)
completely wiping out or invading Oggok?
    Think about how this might look to a new/possibly first time player.
Imagine logging into N Qeynos for the first time, walking out of the city to
the newbie part of the zone, and watching as 100+ lizards or ogres come
rushing into the city, some falling over dead, others attacking every guard
in sight, slaughter everywhere.  Or to log in as your Ogre, only to see the
place being destroyed and taken over by gnomes, and halflings and dwarves.
