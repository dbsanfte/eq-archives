I feel your pain.  Here's how I did it.

Do not bother with practice research.  It's a waste of time.

There are some spells that are research-only, and some that can be bought at
other classes spell vendors.  Learn which are which, and practice
researching on the buyable spells.  The skill goes up VERY fast, usually one
gain on every other combine.

Practice as much as you can, but when it comes time to make the
research-only spell, dump practice points in at the trainer to max out
research.

Oh yeah.  The research skill cap is (Level-15)*5.  So at level 16, the skill
cap is 5.  But when you put that first practice point in, it sets your skill
to 16, which is over the cap.  This means that you will not be able to start
gaining research skill until level 19.  I wish I had known that, because I
wasted all my extra components when I was 16 trying for a skill increase.

Check the vendors for research components.  This is a source that lots of
people overlook.  Get in the habit of checking all the vendors in the area
every couple of days.
