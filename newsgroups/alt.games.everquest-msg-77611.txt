I'd say a necro and a shaman would probably do very well together. 
The necro can snare, DoT, attack with pet.  The shaman can regen, DoT,
heal, debuff/slow the target, attack with pet, buff/haste the pets.
With both cannibalizing hp for mana with regen I wouldn't think there
would be a lot of down time.  The only thing I'm not sure about is the
necro and shaman buffs stacking.  Both of them being able to root is
also a big plus IMHO.
