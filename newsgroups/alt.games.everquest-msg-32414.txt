    The problem is, and most newsgroups and chat rooms are glorious shining
examples of it, that many people do not actually know what the word means.
See, in the US, our "arch-enemy" for many years was a (professed) communist
nation (they were also imperialistic [not an imperial state, just imperial
in their behavior] and socialist).  So, what has happened is that many
people (none of whom have read the little red book, or the communist
manifesto) just figured that Communist meant "THE ENEMY."
    China, isn't doing any better of a job of setting the "record" straight
about the word communist, since, again, their are an imperial socialist
nation which regards their general population as serfs, but their common
description is "communist."  So communist continues to mean "THE ENEMY" for
the uneducated in the United States.

    Okay, let me point out... the Soviet Union was the stated foe of the
United States, as China seems to want to become, and I have no desire to
live under either of their regimes.  Neither do I wish to live in a purely
communist state.  I merely point out that the word communism does not mean
"THE ENEMY" nor does it mean "evil."

(BTW Outer Limits fans, "THE ENEMY" should be pronounced as it was in the
episode "Soldier" by Harlan Ellison).
