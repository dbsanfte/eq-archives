No. You might try reading and, more importantly, *comprehending* what
you read before responding. Warriors are very equipment dependent. True.
What they need is AC and their armor gives it to them in spades. They
also need some other stats. (e.g. STR, DEX, resists, etc.) Their armor,
*in addition* to providing the AC gives them some boosts in those areas.

Necros do *not* require AC, since they won't be meleeing very long in
their careers. A little is nice for the occasional smacking around, but
not much. However, Necros *DO* need INT, and for certain things a few
boosts to CHA, MR, and others wouldn't hurt. So, I guess you think it's
asking for the fucking moon to think that maybe some of the totally shit
AC armor available for necros might have a couple of *those* stats added
on?

No. Apparently it's yours. See above.

I didn't "fucking neglect" it, since it's a false assumption on your
part. (again, see above). Did you fucking neglect the ability to discuss
something without immediately turning into a frothing-at-the-mouth
asshole?
