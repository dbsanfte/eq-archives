Top post corrected.

Actually, not sure who you play with, but clerics I play with cast far 
more than CH during fights.  For one thing, fast heals are invaluable, 
for another, they generally also have time to toss the odd nuke, be the 
puller, hop in and melee.

As a shaman, another priest class, I cast a variety of spells, debuff 
mobs, heal party members, DoT mobs, nuke mobs, hop in and work on melee 
skillups, crowd control.

Admittedly I am only level 68 now, and tend to xp mostly in Fire, WoS, 
and PG sometimes...
