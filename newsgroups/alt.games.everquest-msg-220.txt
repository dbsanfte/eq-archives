The most desired int caster in a group is an Enchanter -- BUT, they don't
start being really exceptionally valuable until mid-late 20's. Also, they're
one of the most difficult classes to play effectively -- don't play them
unless you're good at thinking on your feet.

For wis casters, go for a straight cleric. They aren't exciting to play
(med-heal-heal-med), but are as valuable as enchanters.

Without a cleric or enchanter, any major raid at higher levels is pretty
much dead in the water.

Necros, however, are GREAT for solo play. If you play a necro, you generally
don't NEED a group that bad. Sure, you'll need one for heavy-duty raids, but
for general levelling, you do good alone.
