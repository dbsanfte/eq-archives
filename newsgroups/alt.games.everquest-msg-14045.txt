    I had this problem on Rodcet Nife as well, found Synthan at the
Oasis/Nro border right by the water.  I assumed someone had trained her
there.  She wouldn't buy or sell, but when I turned in a Lightstone I got
the quest results.  I only turned in one *greater* lightstone (I had a
packful or more) since the reward is a container and I only had room for
one.  (Usually I sell these back to her for 8 plat or so, but in this case I
would have had to run to another merchant, sell, return to her, turn in
another GLS, run back to merchant, etc. and I decided it could just wait
till my next trip to Oasis...)

    Strange, though, that she seems to have been out of place on several
different servers simultaneously, if I'm reading this thread right...
