i was in gfay and the text screen read "you hear the light rustle of hooves
in the grass....." then a minute or so later i see this white unicorn (vesa
quickfoot i think) at the lift between newbie and orc.i follow and two
more,these are black,show up.it was clear they were gm controlled.  players
were asking if they need help but they said no.they were just there just to
play.what was this event about? nothing happened.anyone have any insight?
