Yes I've discovered this.

It seems I have to complete various tedious quests, then hand in the
resulting item, and my grandmaster assassins trophy, to get GM assassins
vial.

And boy did i say tedious!  Its a lot of motivation to go killing mob after
mob in PoH for a super rare item.. sigh, i hate PoH soo much.  During my
guildless pickup-raid days, I used to pull a ton on raids (PoF, PoA, chardok
royals, ToV) but i detest that zone so much, i refused point blank to ever
pull it.   (I've pulled 3 demis and Innie, period, in every trip ever to the
zone!

I already did that though, to raise lockpick to 155.  Im sure I have a few
more points saved up since then, but nothing thats taking me to 200+

I don't know how she did it, or what kindof cash you were refering to.. but
for all-in, under 7k, I can't complain.

It paid for itself too pretty much; during his Pling to 65, I spent a lot of
time in PoV (which I had not been back to since the day i was HoH flagged)
and gathered a lot of the components for the vallorium ring of gallantry.
20 combines, 19 successful!

I think I handed out 10 to our collective chars/twinks, which left 9 to sell
(9k and 9.7k), so that was a nice 90kish (minus like like 4k to buy 30-40
sapphires).  I have the liquids to make another 4 (15 talons and enchanted
bricks still, though!)

It also gives a nice new agro-decreaser.  Since he got that tendonslicer, my
rogues a freakin agro-magnet.  Of course, a hide skill higher than 150 will
help with agro too :)

Definately a list to drool over for a main-rogue
