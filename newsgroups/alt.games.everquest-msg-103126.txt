Over clocking simply put is running a processor at a faster speed then it
was sold as (not necessarily designed for).

eg.
Pentium 500 Over clocked at 600 etc.

This could be done by jumpers on the motherboard, or the cmos.  With
videocards, there is often software which can drive the card and you are
able to overclock it through that.   There may be hardware methods of
adjusting it on the card itself, but I'm not familiar with that.

When a processor is overclocked, it generates more head and additional forms
of cooling are required.  Failing that can equal dead processor.  In
addition, a cpu can only be overclocked a certain amount before the core
becomes unstable.  I've tinked with my celeron 500 and had it up to 600,
beyond that I get problems running software and odd OS issues.

I welcome corrections.
