Just out of curiosity I ran Copelands on a dual wielding level 22 warrior,
level 40 warrior and level 60 warrior wielding a variety of weapons.  The
results seemed very counterintuitive, but it would appear that at lower
levels, the higher strength is more important than at higher levels.  I
tried a variety of weapons, and the added damage for 50 extra points of STR
was staying fairly consistantly around 4 percent at level 22, and 2 to 3
percent at level 60.
