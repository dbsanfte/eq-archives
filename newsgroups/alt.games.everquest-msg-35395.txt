Okay .. Being the original poster of this thread I'd like to thank the
people that have answered my question. I feel sad that some of this thread
has turned into a small-minded bickering session. Not *all* people read
*all* the messages or threads in this Newsgroup, in fact it's usually hard
to download the total content of a Newsgroup as threads scroll off to make
way for new ones, or at least that's the way I understand it to work. My
guess is that you must have been bored whislt the EverQuest servers were
down. As for the FAQ I did look in there, but I wasn't able to find my
answer, hence my post. If I missed it in the FAQ well what's the big deal?

Again, thanks to all that have helped me, to the others .. well ... grow up.

Stevie.
