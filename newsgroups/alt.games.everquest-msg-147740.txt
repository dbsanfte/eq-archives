Put some fishing grubs or something in your Ammo slot, and never loot
that, open up a whole main inventory slot for you!  Personally I
have some holy water in that slot, which is a throwing weapon from
a Katta Quest, just cause I think it looks more "cleric-y" than fishing
grubs.  But any ammo slot item will do, not like I'm every going to use it.

And why would I do this?  Well I didn't always have 96% rez you know.
And the rule when rezing a mess is to loot my own body (for the higher
mana pool, HP, and so forth, as well as for the AC in case of a fight) and
then rez everyone else, casting buffs and heals as necessary, until I"m
OOM.  Rez myself only when OOM so none of it goes to waste.  THEN
and only then loot that holy water.
