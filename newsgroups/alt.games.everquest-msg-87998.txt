Yes it can be a long process. As Luc is later if you installed the 
patching process would be quicker. I think the patching took me an 
overnighter. That said it didn't stall just took an incredibly long 
time.

It may have been slower as they have just released a patch causing the 
servers to be hit by loads of downloads as it is
