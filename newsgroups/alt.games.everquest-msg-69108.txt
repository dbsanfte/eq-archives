Some of the "fixes" are kneejerk bandaids.
Case in point:  The Grey, sorry the MR on those mobs are just too
high.  It was an ill thought out fix.  Yes, the zone warranted a
change (30+ mobs in a single pull is just plain silly).  But the fact
that the zone was so broken means they didn't test it enough to start
with.

The latest "fix":  Circle of Seasons and the shaman's group DR/PR buff
(Talisman of Eurp-something), when applied in a certain order could
stack with one of the FR/CR (DR/PR) buffs giving you an artificially
high resist buff.  That was the bug.  The fix is to have ANY FR/CR
buff overwrite Circle of Seasons (not the other way around).  That
means you can cast a low level +20 CR buff to overwrite Circle of
Seasons.

The potential for abuse is pretty high.  Imagine some jackhole running
through a Naggy raid and casting endure cold on everyone.  Instead of
gaining +55 FR/CR, everyone is at +20 CR.

This was a stupid fix for a buff stacking bug.  Ironically they have
the correct fix in game (check Aegloism and group Aegloism).  Sound
like a planned fix?

BTW, Breeze can overwrite Kodiak (that's a level 16 mana regen can
overwrite a 900 mana group C3 buff).  Wouldn't it suck if some asshole
enchanter came along and cast Breeze on you after you've gotten a nice
14 mana/tick regen?

And this is all due to the fact that this expansion was released WAY
too soon.
