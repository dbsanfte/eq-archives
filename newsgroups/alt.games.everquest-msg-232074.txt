The only way they would not be relevant to your post, is if your post was

People of your intelligence level for the most part haven't made it past the
"hungry, tired, happy" level of existence, so I doubt they realized much of
anything about your self-proclaimed totally irrelevant post.

> Here's a helpful hint - you're an idiot.
