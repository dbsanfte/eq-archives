The only tradeskill where I ran into this would have been smithing, in
particular making loads and loads of metal bits.  I did not have an unusual
failure rate while doing so.  Also when making banded armor I was often
encumbered, and again, did not see any unusual trends in success rates or
skillups.  Again, not scientific, just one more datapoint to consider.  I
did do this pre smithing nerf, so I had a lot more time doing banded armor
than people do now.
