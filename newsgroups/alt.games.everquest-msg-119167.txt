Still, he could have been gone already. Since you weren't paying
attention to whether or not he was there you don't know if he left
before or after.

Not sure what you mean or how they rescued you but I can tell you
absolutely for certain that apprentices do NOT have access to the
summon player ability or the command to insta-kill a mob. They don't
even have access to the ability to teleport to any zone they want...

Does she stay spawned indefinately in the forest or eventually
disappear and respawn eventually in the tree if she goes with aggro
cleared for too long? You said you had her spawned in the forest, I
assume you'd cleared aggro and, by the sound of it, you didn't have
her in sight at the time she disappeared. Had you left her un-aggroed
for an extended period, and had you ever left her for that long? It
sounds like there was a stall as some discussion over the GM/guide not
being helpful took place... But I could be wrong, only theorizing on
limited information on the behavior of the spawn itself.

What does checking /who all have to do with seeing who's in your
current zone...?
