No I still wear my qeynos badge and 8th prayer shawl on my 65 bard.  I dont
see anything worth replacing them with.  Certainly not the shawl (FT3!!).
Possibly I may replace the neck with ldon stuff, but will wait till I have
filled my slot 2's.  I may decide to buy the guardians token to replace it
but that isnt cheap (25k).  Bard epic wont be replaced ever unless I get
elemental keyed which is doubtful.
