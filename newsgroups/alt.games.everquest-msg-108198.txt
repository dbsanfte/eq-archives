"Hmmmm"  I said to myself.  "I think I'll throw on Selo's and run from FV,
through LOIO, and into FM and help a couple lower level guildies get some
exp."  I had offered the night before to do so after bank run and camp.
"Boy, I love Selo's!  I sure am fast, huh?"  I think to myself passing a
sowed Druid with ease..."There's the big lizard statue!  Tip-toe through the
Drachnids and I'll be soon enough on my way."
"Hmmmm"  I think to myself, "who is this Vekis fellow meditating in front of
me?"

Flash of light....

"Ooooh, I'm dotted.  No biggie I'll outrun the him before it casts another.
Wait.  Why is my health so far down?  I'm dying??  I haven't died here since
level 18!"

/ooc Who is Vekis?
so-and-so says ooc "Stay away from him.  He's BAD!"

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
you have entered Lake of Ill Omen
Fires up cantana, regen, and a prayer to Bristlebane....

LOADING PLEASE WAIT...
Thanks for nothing, Bristlebane!

Ok, all I could find on this fellow is that he's a high level necro quest
NPC.  I don't care about quest stuff on this guy, I've just made that run
soooo many times and have never seen him or heard of him.

How often does he spawn?  Does he go away after awhile or must he be killed?
Will I ever learn to use tracking before kicking myself in the ass for not
doing so?

Thanks,
SEAN...
