At L15 the Pine Bark (or whatever the Druid stuff is called) is just
good enough to be worth trying for, at L20 might not be worth the
effort except for one or two pieces.  Even at L15 it's a pain since
the Ruined Gnoll Leather pieces all seem to drop off mobs green to
me so I have to follow lower levels around PL'ing them (on FV, TLC
dontcha know) to get my drops.

Oh, and Dennis, Druids need 6 of those damned whiskers, but I'm gonna
skip two since I seriously doubt the gloves are any better than the
Splitpaw Gloves I already own.  My biggest bitch with the Druid stuff
(on FV) is the LORE piece off a ridiculously green mob that I
mentioned in another post.
