One quick and dirty way is to record the mana percntage with each item on,
for example:

Starting mana 55%, remove WIS item it drops to 51%, adding MANA item it goes
to 54%.

So here the WIS item would give ~4%, while the MANA item ~3%. It's not
rocket science, but it's a great in-game way of doing a quick check.
