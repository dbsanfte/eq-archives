I was adjusting the screen resolution through the options menu when I was
logged into my character.  I did it three times and the screen turned black.  I
was able to q/out but now every time I log into the game the monitor turns
black and then turns off.  Is there any way to adjust the video settings w/out
reinstalling the game?  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
