Am I the only one who actually LIKES the Butcherblock newbie area?  I
like it for several reasons, namely that it's rather easy to find your
way around and not get lost, and also hardly anything aggros on you,
not even the goblin whelps, who I believe conned indifferent at the
beginning (I think krag chicks, who con dubious at the beginning, will
start aggroing on you once you've killed enough of them).  Also,
goblin whelps will sometimes drop bags and backpacks which are handy.
(and of course there are a few nice quests you can do like the bone
chip quest and the skunk gland quest, where a newbie cleric can get
level 5 cleric spells).

Of course, you're welcome to disagree but I actually like
Butcherblock; I'd rather fight in the Butcherblock newbie zone than
GF, where it's foggy all the time and easy to get lost, plus dealing
with orc trains and also being crowded and players trying to KS you,
among other things.

(I also prefer Butcherblock to some place like Everfrost, where
everything either aggros on you or else they help each other, no
neutral non-helping mobs like bats or snakes, it's easy to get lost
and you have to watch out for those #%@(* vengeful skeletons wandering
around the newbie area. (then again, Barbarians are pretty tough and
they can more often than not take a beating from several mobs at once
so in some ways it's actually a great newbie zone!)

(I've never fought in Toxxulia Forest but I hear a lot of people
complaining about how that is easily the worst newbie zone; I've heard
people complaining about the Feerrott and Nektulos Forest being lousy
also).

Anyway, that's my two cents' worth at least!
