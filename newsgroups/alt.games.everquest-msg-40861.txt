The second map is the one I've been using forever, it's
a good one to use to find your way around or find a
specific destination.

The first map is indeed beautiful, but I *HATE* the
fact that it's not oriented such that North is "up"
on the page...  On that map, *West* is at the top
of the page.  This makes it very hard to follow.
