A number of these are in the Monual Falls Asleep thread.

My worst was in the caves under Everfrost, fell asleep while sitting on 
the spawn spot of a skeleton while waiting for the Ice Bear that spawns 
once a week or so.  My friends  were casting every spell they could 
think of that makes thunder noise, trying to wake me up.  Finally 
someone called me on the phone and paged me.  That didn't work either, 
but I eventually did wake up on my own.
