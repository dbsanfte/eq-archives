    I'm really beginning to wonder what they're changing that's improving
zone times, and whether it'll increase load times (and thus decrease frame
rates) once you get in the zones.

    ROFL. Thank God they fixed that - those people with 120 unused points
were getting to me. :P

    I sent in a minor bug report. The Troopers in and around Cabilis, and
also the Iksar Bandits etc. around Cabilis, aren't flagged as "male" or
"female", but rather as "it". So they always show up as the old graphic
model, not the new one. Wonder when they'll get around to changing that.
