To visit Paineel, you must first get a key from one of the skeleton guards.
In order for them to talk to you, you will have to slay hundreds of kobolds,
then slay hundreds more.  It's a pain to do, but if you ever plan to hunt in
Stonebrunt Mountains, it sure is nice to be able to bank in Paineel.  Also,
I don't recall ever seeing the guards move.  They may be rooted to their
posts.  I've always just ran between them.
