Except on quests where I need to kill certain mobs, if I'm
ending fights with more than a quarter power reserve
across the group, I look to move on to different mobs.
You can't pull non-stop that way...

XP in EQ was optimized by killing the highest possible mobs
you could kill quickly.   That's not true in EQ2 -- XP there
is optimized by killing the highest possible group mobs you
can kill with a safety reserve.   As you point out, there's no
reason to avoid downtime in EQ2 -- it's so short (assuming
everyone has level-appropriate food/drink) anyway.  With
very little in-battle mana regen, you get minimal benefit from
chain-pulling in EQ2.
