    That was silly of him. You could MGB just about anything on inc and get
aggro. But my group heal can pull mobs off MTs - it's like the paladin group
heal that way.

    I want more than "alive", because that can leave them all vulnerable to
being one-rounded if aggro goes phooey. Let me talk to you about DI theory,
and I don't mean the cleric spell. ;-)

    Every mob in EQ has two numbers associated with its damage output, DB
and DI. A mob will hit for DB + (1 to 20)xDI, where the 1 to 20 part is
determined by things like your mitigation AC versus the mob's ATK. DI is
usually a fairly low number, as if it's a big number the mob will be capable
of hitting for massive numbers max. For example, a mob that triples for 3 K
must have a DI less than 150. This is important.

    So, a caster gets attacked. Let's take the worst case scenario, and
assume they get hit with all attacks, and assume the mob quads. Most of the
big mobs have a DB in the 500 to 1 K range, so call it 4 K minimum damage.
Let's also give this mob a DI of 100 - it can hit for up to 3 K. How much
damage can our caster take? Well, he's a 6 K caster, so he can take up to 20
DI's out of 80 before croaking. He's got a 25% chance of surviving, assuming
no mitigation bonus or penalty. Now assume our caster started 200 HPs lower,
because of unhealed AoE damage. That's a difference of 3.3% of his total
HPs. But his chance to live drops to 18 out of 80, or 22.5% - a 10% drop in
his chance to live from a 3.3% drop in HPs. Do the same analysis for the 8 K
melee - he goes from 40 in 80, or 50% chance to live, to 38 in 80, or
47.5% - a 5% drop in chance to survive from a 2.5% drop in HPs.

    That's why, as you geared up, mobs that used to pulverize you suddenly
became gimp. Every HP you get above the DBxNumber_Of_Swings/Round gives a
magnified chance of survival. That is why I, as a cleric, want everyone at
max HPs at all times. If a mob turns on them, and they can survive that
first round, our healers have an excellent chance of getting them back to
full health and the tanks have a good chance of getting aggro back. But they
need to survive that first round. It's sort of like what I told one
enchanter who was amazed at what a difference her new HP gear made after she
started getting drops. If she could survive two rounds from a mob whose mez
was broken, she would never die because the clerics wouldn't allow it. She
just needed to get her HPs over that "two rounds" level to see her chance to
survive skyrocket.
