I have used a version of this program in the past. It was at the time the
only one that would allow me to use EQ full screen on the remote system. At
least back then it worked surprisingly well. I see they have changed their
website since then and I did not see the free trial version in the few
moments I looked it over but it would be worth you checking out if they have
one :) good luck.
