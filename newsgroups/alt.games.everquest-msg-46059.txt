Sounds like something where you're going to need to put in a /bug report
and contact customer service directly and hope for the best. As for
Erdudin, until you come up with a techie solution, you'll probably just
have to find a wizard to port you to tox and run up from there. The zone
in spot isn't very scary. Just head to coordinates 0,0 and you'll be at
the bridge into the north section.
