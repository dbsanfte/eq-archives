One of the first things you do if you legalize drugs is put all drug pushers
out of buisness. They are in the buisness because it is hugely profitable.
It is only hugely profitable because it is illegal. If Walmart is selling
designer cocaine fresh and pure for 5 bucks then no one in the market now
will stay. There is no profit in it.

The real question that comes up is the harm involved. A high percentage of
people think that a single tote on the bong and that kid is forever doomed
to have square babies, this is the message that you are trying to sell kids
on and they KNOW its bullshit. This gets in the way of the real message that
use over time can have detrimental long term consequences.

The war on drugs itself though has had SERIOUS long term consequences. We
somehow think it fitting to lock up our friends and neighbors in CAGES for
long periods of time, this is a very real tragedy for those people, there
families and friends. We somehow think it is acceptable to let law
enforcement and our goverment use there prying eyes in places that our own
family dosent know (how many of your parents and siblings know to the last
dollar how much YOU made last year and where you spent it?, law enforcement
does.).We are breeding long term criminal empires of REALLY nasty people who
think nothing of the lives around them, and are capable of great casual
violence. We are breeding extreme mistrust of our police and a casual
contempt of law and those who enforce it in general.

In other words we are doing far more harm with the war then the problem
itself does. Throw the baby out with the bathwater. Using a nuke to kill a
mosquito in the middle of downtown. The road to hell is paved with good
intentions but this road has been widened into a 20 lane highway and the
casulty count of broken lives is becomming pretty damn obvious. I have no
wish to spend billions to do harm to US and frankly wonder why so many
others seem to.
