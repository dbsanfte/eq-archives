I am presently a 29th Cleric High Elf on the Quellious server.  I am a
present member of a guild, but I feel I may have outgrown the guilds plan.
(they are prettymuch a noob guild, they have high level characters... but
pretty much let anyone and everyone join).
I have searched the web to find other guilds on this server, but many are
defunct now.

Several that have caught my eye (by web pages not in EQ) are:
Dragons Bane
Storm Mountain
Crush and Swill

If you have any recommendations on a guild on the Quellious server, could
you please post their names and/or their webpage.  Also if you could tell me
why ya like them.

Thanks for your time.
Lew
