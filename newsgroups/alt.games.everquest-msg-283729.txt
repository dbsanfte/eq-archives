Considering the enthusiasm for the two new servers, I wouldn't have any
trouble recommending EQ to a newbie, at least from what I have seen.
Popularity is certainly going to drop off considerably (that's a good
thing) but these severs could probably lose 90% of their active
population and still be great fun.  What a great opportunity for a true
newbie, really.
