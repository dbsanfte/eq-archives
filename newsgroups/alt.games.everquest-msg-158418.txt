Yup.  After finding out EB had actually gotten their shipment in, I
called them at 7 at night.  "Yes, our shipment *did* just come in.
Did you reserve one?"  "Uh... no?"  "Okay well... okay, we do have a
few copies left, so I'll put one aside for you."

store closed.

Nope nope, not Vera--sorry, not Sony's bitch.
