Using your example, the problem with that is that those robe wearers
are helping you get the FBSS to drop.  If they don't know you, and
will likely not see you ever again, and you tell them that they will
get nothing but experience from the camp, how willing are they to
join?  In pick up groups, everyone rolling is the best policy.  In
groups of friends, NBG is probably the best policy.
