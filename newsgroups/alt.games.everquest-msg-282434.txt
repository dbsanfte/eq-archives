I for one would loive to see a revamped PoK if it reduces the lag or
the load time.  With virtually all other zones I usually take 30
seconds or less to zone but when I zone into PoK (and Bazaar) I often
have enough time to play 2 or 3 rounds of solitire game before the
computer finishes loading.

PS any chane we could bug SOE to add another in-game game?  Gem is a
bit old and bland and there are plenety of simple games that are not
copyrighted or trademaked like Solitire (card game predates computer
by hundred years)
