 Ok, just to clarify what you're saying since I'm still a bit hazy... 

I'll agree once you have your SolRo (Plane of Fire) flag you no longer
need the minis. Fine and dandy. And the 85% does work on his chamber.
What I thought you were saying though is once you have SolRo flag you
can get back in his chamber without having all minis. Is that it or am I
confused?
