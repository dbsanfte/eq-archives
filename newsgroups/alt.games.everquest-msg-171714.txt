I'm not clear on what you're saying here.  Are you claiming that the
mere fact that a melee doesn't have sufficiently "uber" gear for to
suit your taste means he canot play competently?  Or are you saying
that a 5% reduction in attack frequency will prevent him from holding
agro (possible on the margins, I suppose) or, /boggle, that that same
5% reduction in attack frequency will somehow prevent him from breaking
mez properly?
