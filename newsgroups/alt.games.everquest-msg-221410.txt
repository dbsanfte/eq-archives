One flaw in your argument is that soloing sucks in general.
Another flaw in your argument is that knights are not by any stretch
of the imagination good soloing classes.
Yet another flaw in your argument is that an all knight group is a
poor group, knights have poor DPS.
But, the main flaw in your argument is that you're a callous fuckwit
who thinks it's okay for some arbitrary fraction of EQ players to be
marginalized.
