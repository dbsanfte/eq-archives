I tried to get my friends to switch to AO until I just about made a nuisance
of myself, then I gave up trying.

I decided "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em", and gave EQ one last try.  And
the realization I have come to is that no matter what I do, the simple fact
remains that to be any better than middling at it requires a time commitment
that I'm just not willing to give at this point in my life.  My friends who
don't have the RL responsibilities I do have made it very clear that they're
tired trying to wait on me .... I'm holding them back.  So I turned them
loose.  "Don't wait on me .. go ahead and do what you need to do."

I haven't made a hard and fast decision on this yet, but I'm leaning toward
this subscription most likely being my last.
