Well if you actually want to play a Halfling, your choices are pretty
limited.

Rogue
Warrior
Cleric
Druid
And in the last year or so
Paladin
Ranger

The funny thing is that many people hate and loath Halfling Druids,
Rogues and Rangers. So if you want to play a halfing, the only
"politically correct" classes are Warrior, Paladin and Cleric. (and my
guess is that many people even look down on these choices.)

Is it the 5% exp bonus? Is it the better than average starting stats
and racial infravision, sneak, hide? My guess is that is is a
combination of all of the above. 

Last night I rolled up a Halfling to persue a roleplaying idea I have
on the FV server. The character will be a baker and a brewer (he's
gonna be a glutonous inept drunkard), so I really want to have the
ability to forage (he likes to eat things he finds on the ground).
That means I had to choose between two "hated" race/class combos
(Ranger/Druid). Now I don't really fancy the character as a "half-man
of action". So I am afraid that I went with the most despised
race/class combo in EQ. So I am afraid that Norrath has another
Halfling Druid, whether it needed one or not.

My choice had nothing to do with number crunching, or faster
levelling. On the plus side, my character will be too drunk to care
whether or not people like him in-game :-P
