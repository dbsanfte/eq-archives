Actually, he has a point. Your presence in the "public forum" of the
game in itself is invitation for people to look at what you're
wearing. As I've said before in this thread, do you go around wearing
a trenchcoat pulled tight around you that goes all the way to the
ground because you don't think it's anyone's business what you're
wearing? Because this whole anti-inspection attitude is exactly the
same.
