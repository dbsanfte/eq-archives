Congratulations, you've just discovered lame ducks and pyramid schemes that
everyone else has konwn about for years.
You might make a few dimes off one or two of them, good luck. But that has
nothing to do with everquest, and now you're a spammer.

PS the 'get paid to read email' is actually 'get paid to read email, follow
the link, fill out the form, and get spammed for the rest of your life.'

It's all about spam. don't believe the hype. All it does is get you on spam
lists and turns you into a spammer just to get that next two cents. It's
truly evil.
