I am trying to help a friend be able to play again.  This started last
Friday.

She logs in & makes it all the way into the world.  In less than 5 minutes,
she is either LD or locked up & has to Ctrl/Alt/Del to get out.  I dont know
her *exact* system specs, but here is what I do know:

Nvidia Vanta (or NVanta?) video card
Creative Soundblaster soundcard (not sure the exact, ummm, model?)
Probably around 700Mhz cpu (Gateway computer bought in 2000)
Running Win98
384Mb of ram
Mostly empty hard drive (unknown size & manufacturer)
Has DirectX 8.1 & all of her drivers are up to date

Now, the attempted fixes:
Downloaded the zip from Sony's website that has Everquest.exe in it.  Why?
Because I had the same problem she is having about a week before it happened
to her.  I dl'd that zip & extracted it & that *seemed* to fix the problem.
Tho, I will grant that the problem may have dissipated on its own.

Re-installed Luclin cd's.  This seemed to fix part of the problem in that
she could stay connected, but the sound no longer worked.

Re-installed all of Everquest.  This undid whatever re-installing Luclin
seemed to fix AND sound still didnt work.  Got stuck with a 2 hour patch for
our trouble, too.  :o(

At some point, her eqclient.ini went MIA.  She searched for it using the
"Find All Files" tool on the Start menu, but it never found it.  It found
backups such as:  backup14eqclient.ini, backup15eqclient.ini &
backup16eqclient.ini.  So, I sent her MY eqclient.ini & had her paste that
into her Everquest folder.  I checked eqclient.ini to be sure it didnt seem
to have anything character-specific in it & it seemed safe from that
perspective.

Later today I am going to try to have her use WinDoc from Norton & see if
that makes a difference.  A friend at work suggested there might be a
conflict/problem somewhere that is causing this.  She wants to re-format her
hard drive, but I am averse to this as she has *no* idea what she is doing
in that regard & I will only be able to help her over the phone as she is in
Maryland & I am in Wisconsin.  Takes me 4 or 5 hours to reformat & reinstall
everything & if the installation fights her.....or if she doesnt have all
her driver cd's & all.....I shudder to think.

I know that it is not her ISP or her PC because she can stay online for as
long as she likes & surf anywhere she likes.  She only has problems when she
tries to play Everquest.

Any help/suggestions would be appreciated.  I am trying to avoid having to
email Verant about this as waiting for a response from them is akin to being
caught under a very slow moving millstone.
