Not earth shaking? Assuming it does melee like the 57 earth pet, and 
continues to stun, this will be a huge advance; in many groups I'm still 
using the 53 pet, since the other pets I've gotten in between either A) 
root, which annoys many people, B) is only advantageous in the rear 
position, which most groups don't seem to set up consistantly, C) is 
only good when being hit [decoy] D) is rediculous fire pet.  Air pets 
stun is a bonus, but frankly just the melee damage upgrade to GV levels 
without the damned Root thing going on would be reason enough to cheer.

LOS spells are annoying in the sorts of groups I'm usually in, and I'm 
specialized in Conjuration (something I may regret if they kill pet 
canni, as rumored), so I imagine I'll be using Shock of Steel more than 
this, although I haven't done the math on it.  I did use Scars of Sigil 
extensively in some cases before getting Shock of Steel, though, so I'll 
have to do the math on Seeking Flame.

I've heard that high level mage pets are immune to fear without this, 
but it might be handy for a couple levels, especially if circumstances 
warrant that I use a lower level pet in order to get root or stun or 
backstab or DS.

I've rarely used rains or any sort of AE, the mana drain part is the 
only thing that makes me curious about this one; I know there are 
encounters where bards and enchanters are very important for their 
ability to reduce the mana of the target, might be handy to add mages to 
that list... but we can't do so while the target is mezzed prior to 
engaging, since the rains will break mez.  Would be more interesting if 
this was a zero damage rain!
