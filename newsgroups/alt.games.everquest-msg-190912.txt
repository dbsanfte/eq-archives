If the server just started up, and there is no higher level people to farm
for the bazaar, I believe you can buy magic weapons from the gypsies in
Oasis, for about 50pp. As an Ogre and an SK you may not be able to trade
with them, I don't know.  With a little more plat and the PoP books you
could try to get a coldian velium weapon in Thurg. Either one would be risky
for a low level player. Sow and invis could help if you have some caster
friends.

It's hard to imagine a new, pristine server with no uber guild transfers, no
bazaar economy. It sounds like an incredibly fun challange.
