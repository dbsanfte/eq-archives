/agree

I might "hire" some friends to help me multi-box as well. :)  

Maybe bribe the developers to put in those tweaks I always wanted :)

Hire a web devolper for my guild, and get things really going!

I still can't see spending real money on in game crap, ruins the whole
point.

And if I still can't outdo all those uber guilds with my friends and all
the time in the world, then I'll just have to admit I suck, and find
another game.
