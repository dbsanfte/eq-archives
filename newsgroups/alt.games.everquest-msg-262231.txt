The premise is that the class as it was is broken but its net class 
functionality is equal or greater than its intended to be. In case its 
greater (which it was) than its bad and needs to be fixed, and he's ok 
with that.

However the charm 'fix' without simultaneous corresponding fixes to 
other broken functionality to the classes detriment results in net class 
functionality LESS than its intended to be.

And in his eyes, (and many many others), its better to leave it broken, 
and over powered UNTIL such a time as you fix the whole thing to bring 
it to where its supposed to be then it is to fix it so that its less 
powerful than it *should* be.

Or in your paraphrased words ... 'Yes it needs to be fixed, but don't 
fix it yet.'

Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.

Perhaps more importantly there was little way of scaling the danger in 
charming as we move forward. More and more reward... no additional risk.
