Actually, Ben posted his guild's web site some time back when I asked
for it and I check in now and again. Compared to LoS, FoH, Afterlife,
et. al. theirs is one of the most mature, calm ones I've seen for folks
who can play at tier one levels.  Then again, they might be the rare
case where most all of them are over 18 and have jobs, get laid, etc.

Of course, I'm speculating based on the postings of one member and a web
page, so I could be way off base. ;-)
