MS took down IBM?  MS has never been in real competition with IBM, they are
focussed very differently, software versus hardware.  The thing that hurt
IBM the most is not MS, it's IBM.

They didn't realize that big iron would become so much less important.  FYI,
IBM had a laptop protodesigned before anyone else, but then the senior suits
decided nobody would want one and shelved it.

MS's biggest stroke of luck was when IBM didn't guess that people would buy
an OS separately from the computer and therefore didn't lock MS into an
exclusive provider agreement; they allowed MS to sell their OS under their
own brand name, separate from the same OS being sold under the IBM
imprimateur (PC-Dos versus MS-Dos).

Numbers for fun:

IBM quarterly sales for 2003 (all numbers in millions):

Q1 - 20,065    <-- 20 billion dollars.
Q2 - 21,631
Q3 - 21,522
Q4 - 25,913

MS quarterly sales for 2003 (all numbers in millions):

Q1 - 7,835
Q2 - 8,065
Q3 - 8,215
Q4 - 10,153

Linux isn't a turkey.

WordPerfect wasn't a turkey originally.  It was turned into one by Corel who
systematically destroyed pretty much everything that made it the best word
processing package at the time.
