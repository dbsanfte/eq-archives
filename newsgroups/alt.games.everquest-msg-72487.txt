Actually, I doubt that.
A ranger's damage output is pretty high.  If you're going to argue
epics, swiftwind gives them a pretty spiffy level of haste along with
a decent ratioed set of weapons (and next to the Freebringer, probably
the easiest set of epics to obtain).

Toss in their own ATK buffs, and a mid 50's ranger fear kiting a blue
con animal mob should be able to generate about 30 to 40 dps without
too much difficulty.  I'm guessing, a level 37 to 42ish mob, should be
dead in about 60 seconds.
