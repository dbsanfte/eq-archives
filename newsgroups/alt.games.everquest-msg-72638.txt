I played a 22nd blademaster in hibernia, and found that you do need good
equipment to be able to get decent exp.  Also for running you really need to
decide if your going to win or not earlier than 2 bubbles of health, because
when you try to run with only that much health, you are a goner.  If your
going to run, you need to prep to sprint, then wait a few secs, then run,
and after about 5 to 10 seconds of sprinting turn off sprint, with having
some stamina left to continue to run.  Also if your computer isn't up to
specs ( like mine wasn't), sprinting and running is even harder / if not
impossible.

Each critter has a body type that sometimes has a weakness to the weapon
type your using.  Spriggins sound like you were getting pluses on each swing
of damage dealt.  Those should probably be your bread and butter for going
up levels.

Personally I found DAOC an interesting diversion, but decided after awhile
that it was too similiar to EQ and didn't feel like paying for both (an
extra $120 + a year to have DAOC on retainer), and that the 1) equipment
didn't really have enough diversity, 2) the PvP was super boring, 3) Too
many newbs.  Also  that the main attractions I was very interested in
weren't really in place (No building a city or house / no being a dragon or
superhero).  The MMorpgs I will stick to ( hoping they are as good as the
hype ) is Horizons and City of Heroes.  Also will look at Star Wars
Galaxies, although probably won't stick with it.
