Hehe, gotta admit, its fast. Needed when i have a 50+ mb log file around.

Now, how about making a tool that can take lines out from log files? Not 
just the standard auction, shout and so on, but user defined lines too?
Think 80% of my log file are auctions from the auction channel (EQSN), 
locs, and tracking messages.
