One word: chaos.  There's no way you could ever have enough servers.  And
there are Star Wars fanatics out there who would literally (RL) kill other
players if it meant their connection improved.

Have you read Dune?  It's about as "mature" as a story or a fictional world
can be and it's very hard and very scifi.  Goblins, elves, dragons, and
magic arrows aren't silly, but space travel and cybernetics are?  I'd really
like to hear your reasoning.

So would the 9,999,999 other people who will sign up on the first day.  One
of the core concepts of the Jedi is that there are very few of them, both
because so few individuals have the ability, and because it is so difficult
to train and reach Knight level.  But that will change drastically in a
world not directly controlled by Mr. Lucas.  There won't be any Smuggler
PCs, no Moisture Farmers, no Wookiees (unless they're Wookiee Jedi), no Hutt
Gangsters, just ten million Jedi Knights running around controlled by
pimple-faced 13-year-old geeks, using the Force to screw up other people.

That's another thing: Being a Jedi is supposed to require a VERY strict code
of behavior.  If the turd players don't adhere, do their Jedi characters
succumb to the Dark Side?  I would be very much in favor of a system like
that.  Imagine the shock on the turd's face when he sees this on the screen
of his five-minute-old Force-user:

"Innocent_Bystander_342 refuses to help you.
You use the Force to choke Innocent_Bystander_342.
Innocent_Bystander_342 dies.
You have used the Force to perform an evil act.
**You have given in to your hate.  You are now a Dark Jedi.**
Your faction standing with AllJediNPCs just went down to KOS!"

And now, the icing on the cake: the developers have a few VERY powerful
free-roaming Jedi NPCs running around thwarting evil a la Tundra Jack.......
