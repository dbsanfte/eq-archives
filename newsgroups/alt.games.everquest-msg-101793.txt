Folks should just allow other folks to live and let live. You really
can't change anyone anyway or change what they do. If someone cheats
and gets caught they are gone. Its the same if someone speeds on the
road while driving a car. I hate folks that speed and pass me in a
reckless manner but I can't do anything about it, but I'm the first to
laugh when I see them pulled over 3 miles down the road. 

Ohh biz why would a chanter at level 5 need 100 pp?? Hmm let me see.
Perhaps make a smith to make armor to sell to other folks? 
I think I need 300 plat to become a master at smithy.

To aquire the plat I have a few options, I can drop money off of my
main (which is a royal pain in the ass), I could level and spend a few
weeks leveling upgrading my weapons, spells and still not have 300
plat for my trade skills. Or I can do the only somewhat profitable
trade skill in the game for 8 hours. I didn't buy any plat for real
money but while doing this if offered I sure as hell would have if
given an easy and safe way to do so.

Bitch if it makes you happy.
