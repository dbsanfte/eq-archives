I've noticed this same issue in Stonebrunt, when I was hunting kitties for
their pelts.  Everytime I'd go into battle against a kitty with my bard,
using the fear kiting technique, it would always wander to this one
particular area and start pathing back and forth between these two trees...
Only problem is, it would warp back to the other tree instead of just
walking back...  Very annoying.  Even more annoying is no matter where I am,
these kitties start walking toward that same spot so they can warp.. .:)
