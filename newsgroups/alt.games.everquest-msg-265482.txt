There is no hard info.  There just aren't enough high-level folks in the beta
to really know, and there's not that much mixing between good and evil (in the
beta at least).  They're the same up until level 20, and the spell lists look
fairly similar.

Also, there will be at least 3 rounds of class individualization followed by
rebalancing in the 6 months after release, so anything that you know now will
be wrong in a year.

I expect any differences on that level to be changed as SoE tweaks their game.
