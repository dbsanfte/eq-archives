heh, thats the problem with my simple rules of thumb, people always have
to find a scenario I haven't adequately covered.  In this case does your
tactic rely on that initial move away from you?  Is it the only reason
you are able to fight this mob, or if it came right at you would you
still be fighting it?  Do you move back and forth to force it to repeat
this process?  If the answer to any of these questions is yes then I'd
say it falls on the exploit side, if all are no, then no harm done.

As for the negative impact part of your post.... hmmm, I wonder if the
mobs aren't guilty of exploiting pathing in order to agro their friends
to come help.  I don't think I have enough thumbs to come up with a rule
on this.

oh, and you really didn't have to preface your remarks with a disclaimer
hehe.  I don't mind if someone disputes my positions with valid
discussion.  That is the whole idea behind usenet in my world.
