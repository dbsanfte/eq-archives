I'll echo the sentiment.  Playing both a wizard and an enchanter, I can
*instantly* tell in groups and on raids who's played their toons up, and who
was powerleveled.  A PL'd wizard doesn't understand the subtleties of their
craft and frequently dies - but seldom kills anyone else, unless they start
the mob pingponging.  (A PL'd enchanter is not just an excuse, but a REASON
to leave a group or raid.)

The temptation is to get levels as fast as possible, so you can play
alongside your higher-level friends.  Resist the temptation.  What's the use
of getting to high level, only to kill or embarass their friends among their
peers because you lack basic skills common to your class?  At a minimum,
play your toon each level until you have all the skillups possible for that
level, then PL until you ding and again play your toon up.  This will give
you the minimum understanding you need to play effectively.

There's lots of good advice on these newsgroups and the various boards.
However, it doesn't replace practical experience; it's a starting point.  Go
solo, go get a group, learn what it means to kite outside, learn how not to
kite inside a dungeon.  Have fun.  It's a game!
