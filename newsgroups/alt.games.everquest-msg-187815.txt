Enter bazaar, look at the ground, hit alt+a or type /bazaar

Enter your search parameters.  Hit search button.

Scroll through list of things for sale matching your parameters (or modify 
your parameters to get more/fewer hits).  Right-click on an item name to 
see stats for that item.

When you find something you want to buy, right-click on the name of the 
seller and it will point you toward them.  You'll probably have to run 
through/around some buildings to find them.  When you find them, right-
click on them and it acts just like a merchant (except no faction/cha 
issues).

HTH,
