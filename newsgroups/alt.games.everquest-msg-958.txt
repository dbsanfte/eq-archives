One big thing when grouping with enchanters or high lvl
necros that use mem blur to erase mob hate,  do not
DOT when using mem blur.  

The mob will forget who cast the DOT and if the DOT
kills the mob no xp for anyone.  Not a good thing when
you just blew all your mana and most of the tanks HP
on a high lvl mob.
