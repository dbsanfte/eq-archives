My dwarven warrior currently wields one in his primary hand.  It gets a bad 
rap because of the weight, which drains tour stamina.  The people in the NG 
here say to just keep your stamina over 100 and you only lose the ability 
to jump.  The Wurmy is a great weapon once you hit level 20.  People say 
it's crap because that's what kids do - yell about stuff instead of 
investigating the facts.
