If all you're looking for is xp, I agree it's a good place.
The mobs are plentiful and repop quickly.  But I generally
prefer either (a) a group to socialise with or (b) interesting
fights or (c) good loot to go with the xp, or (d) all of the
above. :-)

Actually, the thing I found most disappointing about those
rooms in Forgotten Halls, is that nothing happens if you
manage to clear the room.  The NPC standing outside because
he's afraid of rats/bats still just stands there and says
the same thing, and eventually the room repops.  I was hoping
for some reward, or at least for something different to happen.
