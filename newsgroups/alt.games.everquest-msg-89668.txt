I have a Feign Death Practice hot key that does
/doability 4   (feign)
/sit off

Then I have my left and right arrow keys bound to User-defined 9.
I place my Feign Death Practice hot key in slot 9 of one of my hot key
banks, and then use this bank when I'm not fighting, for example on my
way back to Cabilis to sell off stuff and bank.

I have an iksar monk at level 21, and his FD is maxed out because of this.

I also use this technique for other skills such as sense heading,
forage, and mend.  And they are maxed out too.
