 They aren't invissed. However, they have an annoying habit of running
off the dock and standing under water waiting to aggro anyone they don't
like.

 Advice? Make it to OT (jump off and swim to shore outside of outpost
before boat gets to dock) and /ooc and see if someone can drag your
corpse out. More than likely you'll be able to find one helpful person
that's not kos in the outpost.
