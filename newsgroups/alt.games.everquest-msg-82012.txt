im sorry but thats just totally false, as far as the end game goes.  Me
naked means no haste, no night vision, low 80's stats, about 1600hp, and
about 800 ac.  That is not 85% effective at the high end game.  Sure its
possible (I've had to tank naked in Velk pits, with the rest of the group
naked) but bye bye goes the ability to cheal so clerics have to use mana
costly, your damage is so much lower that casters can really get agro with
the click of their fingers.

I didn't even have armour till 28, when somebody laughed at me and gave me a
set of raw silk. I didn't have haste till a friend won an fbss and gave it
to me, at level 49.
At level 50 I had no weapons

No you can't.  I'd love to know how a monk in junk gear could pull (1
example) Tormax ramp.  Some mobs red to 60, hitting for 400, running at SoW
speed.  Or pull HoT mobs in ToV (or nToV, any wing for that)

Granted you may be refering to a lower aspect of the game.. grouping in DL,
GD etc.. but that doesn't cover all people who play monks.

Don't get me wrong i love my monk
