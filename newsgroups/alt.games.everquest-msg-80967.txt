Pretty unlikely, the Crusaders are uncommon enough that
I never saw two in the same area together during my
month or two in CT.

The healers, on the other hand...  The biggest problem
with them isn't their Wrath casts, it's their damned
heals.  Getting two or more healers in a pull can be
very annoying, and often very dangerous, because just
when you think you have things under control, they heal
the mob you were about to kill (and/or each other) and
extend the battle again.

Make sure you keep your Stun line of spells up to
interrupt them as much as possible.
