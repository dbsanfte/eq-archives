I figure that there are no guarantees in the game, and therefore it's
incumbent upon each and every player to be prepared to defend himself
as needed. Going AFK for the night and leaving your pet to collect XP
for you isn't a good choice in the self-defense department.

Regardless of the specifics of this case, ultimately the AFK folks
have no one but themselves to blame.
