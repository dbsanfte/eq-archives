I experienced this last night.  I switched to a different character
and my frame rate went through the floor.  I was turning a pixel every
second and couldn't even send a tell, because typing slowed down so
much.  The night before, my friend had a similar problem.

As you mention, getting completely out of the game fixes it.
Personally, I think it's a problem on their end (perhaps with certain
hardware configurations?) which hopefully will be fixed soon.

For reference, I have P2 866, 512 mb, GeForce 3, plenty of room on
hard drive, SB Live.
