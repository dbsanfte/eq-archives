Partly yes. Partly because hooked on phonics is a good word 
pronunciation strategy. Not a good reading strategy.

No. Holistic reading never even attempts at coming up with a 
pronunciation of a word.

Holistic reading *never* claims to provide pronunciation.

What practical value is the correct pronunciation if I don't know what 
it means?

Holistic reading is the process of attaching a word-shape to a meaning. 
It can do that via memory recall for word-shapes you know, and via 
context for word-shapes you don't know.

Phonic's value is in providing a basis for learning to pronounce words. 
And to match words in print to words already known audibly.

The two approaches to pronunciation that I'm familiar with are phonics 
and rote memorization.

Obviously the idea of learning to pronounce exclusively by learning 
whole words by rote via flahcards is dumb-as-rocks stupid. A system 
incorporating word families, patterns, and phonics rules is a much more 
sensible system to provide a reader a framework from which to approach 
pronouncing a particular word. 

Once you learn to pronounce that word though, committing it (the word-
shape) to memory for future holistic retrieval is critical to decent 
reading skills. (Not -every- word mind you, but definately most of 
them.)

The next time you encounter that word you should be able to holistically 
retrieve it. If you have to stop at each word and apply phonics to get 
past it you aren't reading effectively. So much of your concentration is 
devoted to sorting out what a *word* is that you'll lose track of the 
meaning of the sentences you are reading.

The point is, you want to be able to read holistically, glossing over 
the occasional word you don't know with context cues, etc. (Although you 
should have the ability to stop and come up with a pronunciation for it 
too, if you need to.)

Bottom line: holistic reading is good. phonetic reading is bad.

BUT using phonics to learn pronunciation, and as part of bootstrapping 
yourself to having a good holistic vocabulary is *good*.

Tying this back to the original thread. A holistic word retrieval 
approach (relying on the minds error tolerant pattern matching abilities 
to word 'shapes', and holistic ability to skip words and deduce them 
from context cues will read that misspelt paragraph relatively 
effortlessly vs someone who attacks the sentence a word at a time 
applying phonetic rules.

Of course, my little jibe at DT wasn't entirely fair. It may be that 
many of the readers who are challenged by the paragraph are holistic 
readers, but their holistic word shape retrieval isn't as error 
tolerant. (ie there is more than one explanation, being 'hooked on 
phonics' isn't the only explanation for someone's trouble with the 
paragraph, even if it is a good one.)
