My brawler has most of his app 3 abilities and the cost isn't much at all,
you just need to harvest a lot of easy things eg lead, roots. It's time
intensive and requires inventory shuffling. It really helps to have boxes
and backpacks, and i can see that as expensive if you are going to buy them
rather than make them. Perhaps you cna find someone who will make thme for
you if you gather the ingredients? (wood and sullied pelts, in the easy
zones just outside freeport, don't know qeynos *yet*)
