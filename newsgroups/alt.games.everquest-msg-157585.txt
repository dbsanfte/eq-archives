I find a good spot for it is NK. You have a port, a bind, a guard tower to 
med at (riiiiight) and a ton of beetles that don't run and assist each 
other. Your buffed weenie goes and pulls appropriately leveled beetles 
(pincer are wussy, borer are tough, scythe are nastybad) while you thorn 
and med. Be sure to be in wolf form though, as the lions will attack you 
while you sit otherwise.
