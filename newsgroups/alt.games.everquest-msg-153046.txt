VSR - he can be duo'd (when you figure 3 people have killed the real VS,
non-MB)
DE Corruptors - I've seen a *druid* solo them.  Easy duo fight

Seahorse, no fought him but he's not a badass AFAIK.. maybe I'll get bored
and find him up sometime

I went months before i got my pipe from chardok.  No I didn't try everyday
(was quite hard to get a good enough group in chardok back then, I was in a
US guild but actually played Euro hours for once), KC pipe I got lucky with
but it could have been another lengthy affair
