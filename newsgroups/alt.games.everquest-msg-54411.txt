This isn't totally true, they have usually tried to do some sort of
trick or treat events for halloween.  The one year it was the Plane of
Fear that opened.  but they usually try to do something.  Are they doing
it now, to try to keep customers, possibly in that they are making it
more wide known they are doing something, but I think it's more just Hey
it's halloween we want to do some trick or treating too.
