Any four person group has to be very well geared, and will still likely 
have a rough time of it.

I have a 4 person skeleton crew of people that have the same play 
schedules. It consists of myself (51 Cleric), a 52 Chanter, a 55 SK and a 
54 Ranger. We then add DPS from a rotating list of people we may or may not 
know.

The other night, we had a Monk ditch us, literally, at the last moment. We 
went down to 5 people and made it through the adventure, with 5 whole 
minutes to spare.
