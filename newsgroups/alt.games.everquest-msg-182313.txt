Lake of ill omen used to have a lot of chatter going on in ooc and shout,
but there wasnt usually fights over spawns. The zone is BIG and can easily
support 100 people with wandering mobs. Paldal cant tho. I cant believe some
of the crap that happened there on FV server. Id consider a group of 4 huts
to be a camp for some group... but no... on FV another group will just sit
down next to you and *expect* you to share. Then maybe a third group would
sit down and expect their share too. lol Id like to see some group try that
at inner in POV on my mains server.
