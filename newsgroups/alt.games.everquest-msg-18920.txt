Gee, this really makes a whole lot of sense....

anyone mention that you sound like you have the common logic of an
idiot?
Unfortunately, since you're probably the only person playing the game
that uses this line of thinking, how the fuck would a role player or
anonymous person know that they're wasting their time asking a
question of a complete fool? Do you wear a sign around your neck?


Uh duh, if I have /roleplay on then they do not know I am a cleric or
capable of rezzing them, so they will not bother sending a tell when I am
not leaving what I am doing. Now on the other hand, there are complete
idiots out there.
For example:
I am in Fear, not anon or roleplay, I got 7 tells for rezzes outside of
fear. Hmm, seems I should have left roleplay on. 3 of the people requesting
rezzes were abusive because I would not leave and rez them.
Now if I had put roleplay or anon those lovely, smart people would not have
known I was a cleric and would not have wasted their time sending me tells.
