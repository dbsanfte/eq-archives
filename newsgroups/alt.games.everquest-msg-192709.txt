How do you know that?  I don't think she ever said where she was tracked to
at all.  Once the eye charms you, then you generally go on a runaround till
charm wears off.  The evil eye chamber has tall walls and I have seen eyes
climb right up them.  WAY up them.  I've also heard of a case where a
charmed player had to gate out after charm wore off because he also ended up
way up there and couldn't get down without doing a 10k.
