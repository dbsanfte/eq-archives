This sort of depends on what you define as omniscient I suppose.  To me, 
it means having complete, universal knowledge.  With said knowledge, time 
is irrelevant.  To be omniscient an entity must know everything that ever 
was, that is, and that ever will be.  Now, if we decide that omniscient 
means just complete knowledge of everything at any given moment, then, I 
suppose you could argue what you are arguing, but, that is not the 
definition of omniscience to my knowledge, it certainly is not the 
definition that I use.
