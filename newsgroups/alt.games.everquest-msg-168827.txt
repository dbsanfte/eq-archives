OMG...
I am getting very frustrated with my 54 warrior. I am pretty well euipped,
but tired of being told that I should be in KC. I spend 4 hours in a group
chain pulling to get like 1 blue. I am 3.5 blue into 54 and wondering where
is a better place to farm exp. Tried velks and OS... but tough finding
groups... Tried planes in PoP, and almost impossible to find groups. I am in
a good guild, but they are all 61+ and tough to get them to do exp with me.
I need 60 badly!

hehe
Post suggestions on where warriors get the fastest exp push for the time.
