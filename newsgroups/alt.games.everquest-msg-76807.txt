Actually for me ezboard is about the best internet consistantly well
performing site of all. When sites like allakhazams or such are slow
as hell I go to an ezboard to see if its my connection or the sites
which are slow since ezboard is always running well.

Don't know if its your connection or router or what. Its kind of the
nature of the beast though that sites which perform very well for some
people are going to perform very bad for others due to what the
internet is.
