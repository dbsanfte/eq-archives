Psst, in your mid rant consider the following:

In ToV, we have glimmer wings which are either druid or ranger mobs.
They tend to have some rather nasty damage shields.  But more
importantly, they cast this same damage shields on OTHER mobs such as
oh an ancient temple guardian (that's a wurm for those wondering).

Now, the standard tactic against these are as following:

1.  Recant all buffs (damage shields, and ESPECIALLY the GOD DAMN SoW
that the glimmers cast on these).
2.  Tash.
3.  Occulsion.
4.  Malo.
5.  Snare the fuck outta of it.

And it has to be done in that order (recanting after someone manages
to FINALLY get snare to stick usually is a bad idea...letting a wurm
run is an INCREDIBLY Bad Thing(tm)).

Also consider in ToV you have anywhere between 15 to 50 people at the
same time.  That's an AWFUL lot of spam (usually I only have my group
spell messages turned on).  You absolutely need to have these macros
to communicate the message to other folks.

But you're absolutely right, those cutesy little macros for healing,
buffing and otherwise common spells while in exp grind groups set my
teeth on edge (and of course, never forget those little macros for
"inc").
