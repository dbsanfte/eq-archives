Its good for a Cleric which is what I meant.  I appreciate the fact that
when I buy a stack of miraculous food it lasts a month and I dont have to
waste time summoning every single day. As a mage you can just summon a stack
of food/water in 10 secs but for me it would take 5x longer and more so
because when I did summon I used my SS armor. Regen would be wasted on me
because I can heal myself.
