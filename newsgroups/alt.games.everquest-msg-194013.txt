I've never been a Street Fighter person, so I can't comment on its depth (
the only 2D fighting game I've played with any regularity was the 
Samurai Shodown series... And Mortal Kombat 1 on the Amiga :), but 
Virtua Fighter is by far the deepest of all the 3D fighting games. VF3 
was weaker than VF2, although VF4 appears to be a return to form.

As for defensive play, defensive VF players are called "machi" (or 
"turtle") players, and it's a pretty dominant strategy, to such an 
extent that it's actually banned in some arcades in Japan.
