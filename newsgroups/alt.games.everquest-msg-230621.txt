Something like that. It's purely a business move for him. He's doing
it to make himself look like a savior for EQ communities in financial
trouble (nevermind that he ends up ruining every board he takes over
because the biggest, wisest, and most influential posters tend to jump
ship as soon as he sinks his claws in) to drum up good publicity for
himself. I have no doubt that he also makes a good penny off all those
email addresses registered to users of the forums he buys selling them
off to spammers.
