I think it boils down to this... grouping melees and support casters 
don't necessarily require a whole lot in terms of manual dexterity (
although a CHeal chain *does* require precise timing, and that's skill).

On the other hand, Bards and most soloing classes do require deft 
"twitch" skills to survive overpulls. Hell, one of the reasons I got 
addicted to quad-kiting for a while wasn't the big XP, it was the way it 
gave my movement skills a workout.
