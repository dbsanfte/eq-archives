The Miller armor isn't that spectacular. Do the quests using LQ and MQ
pelts if you feel like it, sell the HQ bear pelts for 30 pp each or
whatever they go for on AB, find a smith (if the channel
tradeskills:tradeskills exists on AB, you can find a smith there and
possibly also find buyers for your pelts) and get as much banded as
you can. Since you're human, you'll need medium sized banded.
