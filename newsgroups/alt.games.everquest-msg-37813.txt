Sounds like Verant has server problems they do not want to acknowledge and
are creating a stonewall to hide behind when thing get really bad and some
of the more overloaded servers start to crash regularly.  My bet is they
have a hardware problem looming in the future and  are either unable or
unwilling to fix it and a looking for a way to cover their tracks when
things start to fall apart.
