Yes.  The conventional wisdom is don't run, but running isn't ALWAYS a
bad idea.  In places where the mobs have to follow their own (often
bizarre) pathing, it's quite possible to get out ahead of them,
possibly enough distance to get off a Divine Aura for example.

And I should add that I wasn't running at first, I was telling the
tanks I was being beat on and waiting for them to help.  I only
started running when it was run or die.  This was at the pit in Paw,
incidentally, so the zone wasn't that far away

But I will certainly try not rooting and telling the tanks the
*instant* I start get beat on, so I thank John for that suggestion.
