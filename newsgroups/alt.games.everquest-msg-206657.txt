Well, in the case of Sony, they sell an awful lot of goods into the EU, 
it would be pretty easy to convince them to pay the tax I suspect.  In 
the case of companies with no EU presence at all, I suppose they could 
attempt to flout the law, in which case, perhaps the service would be 
blocked, don't know.
