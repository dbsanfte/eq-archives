Every once in a while I get an itch to do tradeskills. 
This usually happens after seeing the Bazaar prices for
Earring of Xanthe/Solstice components. Tosev is still 
working on his Fishing (51), and I think the Mistletoe 
Cutting Sickle is halfling cultural, but the Golden 
Idol of Tunare shouldn't be so far out of reach...
should it?
  I can't help it. The lure is too strong. So I have 
Rabotev work on Pottery. Large bowls are cheap enough, 
as are regular poison vials. But then comes the LINED
poison vials. What material to use for the lining?
  Not many pelts or skins of ANY quality in the Bazaar.
Oh, wait - here's someone with 300 zombie skins. At 10pp
each. Not per stack, but EACH. Gulp.
  Better to farm them. Off to Unrest, where Rab runs 
around the courtyard, giving every beetle and restless
dead a whack with his scimitar before running on to the 
next one. Get everything in front of him, pop off an 
Upheaval - WHAMMMM. Everything dies. A beuatiful thing 
to watch.
  Even so, zombies don't drop skins all that often. I
eventually give up and resign myself to shelling out 
several kpp for the skillups. This gets me to 188; then
the Casserole Dishes, which require milling huge numbers 
of fully fired ceramic linings. Then buying the casserole
dish sketches available only from a vendor in Jaggedpine -
a pain navigating through the winding tunnels behind 
SFG. After all that, for some 150 or so tries, I get all 
of five skill ups. Five.
  Is the rate of skill ups proportional to the vendor 
price of components? Or are near-200 skills just impossible
to raise? Whatever, I give up and shell out 5k for the
components for Ada's Solstice earring. Rab still needs both
a Solstice and a Xanthe.
  High level Pottery also requires vials of clear or 
distilled mana. I have no chanter, but they're just too 
useful not to have; have to make one. Also needs lacuered
gems. Ada's Jewelcrafting is gotten up to 130 cheaply 
enough, so that's taken care of. And enchanted clay blocks;
much lower level chanter stuff. 
  Then I find distilling mana requires diamonds as a reagent,
explaining why vials sell in the bazaar for so much. You 
just can't beat the system.
  Off to Dulak for more grindage...
