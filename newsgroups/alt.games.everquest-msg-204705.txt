"Tailoring is pure evil suckled from the
> cold teat of Innoruuk himself."

My tailoring is 28...I stopped because I was scared :)

Fletching 185, smithing and brewing around 150ish though :)

None of these are much use except for helping out the odd newbie with a nice
17/48 bow and a stack of 150 range arrows, or some armour if they are in
need (thats if i'm not spending all my time, what was it again? buff
begging? (old thread, some flames no one will remember =/ ))

Oh and brewing comes in useful for making yourself feel ill, or selling
heady kiola / paela in bazaar (4pp to make 20 heady, sell for 2-5pp each, I
sell for 2, which I see as none greedy, tailoring is a bitch (jagged pine
dye is another matter though :) ).
