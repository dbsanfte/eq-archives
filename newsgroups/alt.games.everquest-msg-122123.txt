Can anybody tell me what the hell is the point of TLC'ing LORE
quest bits on a server with one character per account?  I mean fer
Pete's sake do they think I'm gonna open six new accounts so I can
farm the stuff?  (Actually, if they thought that I'll bet they'd
drop the restriction overnight.)  The most irritating (i.e. recent)
  example is the Large Field Rat Pelt for the Surefall Druid newbie
armor cap, an uncommon drop from a mob that goes green about an hour
into your characters "life", stupid to make it LORE in the first
place, even worse that means it's TLC'd and thus essentially
unavailable (one character per account, you can't pay a lowbie to
get it for you because there isn't a lowbie available).  Same crap
with the drops off the BB gnolls for the quests, get some L20 in
BB hunting faction and the already uncommon drops become rarer
than snow in Jamaica.

One character per account, LORE makes it one item per character, and
these geniuses decide that LORE should be TLC'd when virtually every
interesting quest at any level of the game involves LORE items.
I've never bothered to pursue the epic with my main on Tunare
because in EQ "epic quest" is code for "mind-numbingly boring time
sink punctuated by the occassional asswipe who ninja-loots or KSes
just so you can wait longer" (can't wait to ding 53 so people stop
trying to drag me onto the Vox/Naggy treadmill) and now I guess I
won't bother to do any fucking quests on FV, the "roleplaying
preferred" server, since "TLC" is apparently code for "if your quest
is high enough level that you can be assumed to be wealthy then you
can pay the 6 account loot-whore an outrageous fee to get that last
bit you didn't know you needed until 16 levels after the mob went
green".  Funny, I used to think that questing was a big part of
fantasy roleplaying.
