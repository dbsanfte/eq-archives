 Snare, so the mob is slowed down. 
 Harmony, if there are several mobs that might aggro so you can single
pull.
 Flame Lick, for the minor debuff and HP damage.
 Grasping Root, so the mob is stopped, if you want to practise
archery, etc. Keep snare up on it for when Root breaks.
 Panic Animal, for fear kiting animals (be sure it is an animal, you
may be surprised).

Don't forget your buffs like Skin like Rock, Feet like Cat, and
Thistlecoat. Also Firefist (slight increase to melee atk), and Hawkeye
(slight increase to archery atk) if you have the mana.

Soloing Aviaks at the Aviak town in South Karanas, I pulled towards
the Lake Rathetear zone line (you can pull in any direction but North
and East has many Aviaks on patrol who may add, I found that out<G>).
Snared, flame licked, while backing up and shooting arrows. Once in
the hills, rooted then pin cushioned, renewing root (snare, flame lick
as needed) and backing up as needed. Usually as mana got low (I
consider 40 pct to be low <G>), let the Aviak close to melee. Once it
turns away or stops fighting (when it's health drops below 20 pct), I
switched to my other weapons (1H blunt, 2H blunt, 2H Slash, and/or
Piercing) to work them up. I worked up Archery from 33 to 150 (max at
lvl 29) doing this time.

I particularly liked my shovel (dmg 4 dly 27) for 2H blunt. I found
that moving to the front of the mob took longer to kill it so more
swings and more chances for skill ups though you are open to ripostes.
My Silver Swiftwind (dmg 16 dly 24) for 2H slash tended to kill them
too fast.

I tried fear kiting once. Snared a sabertooth tigress (gtm, okay I
didn't know how it would work, so I wanted to feel safer), flame
licked, then Panic Animal, chased it and smacked at it. Renewed Panic
as needed, same with snare, until it fell over. Need to practise it
more.

Aside from knowing what paths the mobs follow, you should know where
the zone lines are and how to get there.

If you go the Archery route, look for a bow with low delay (I would
suggest good range too). I made my own hickory bow (dmg 10 dly 50, rng
50) but purchased a Shissar bow (dmg 20 dly 35, rng 150) in the bazaar
for 250 plat (which turned out to be an apparent bargain) and it
really helped me. You want the faster bow to get the skill ups. YMMV.
Also take up fletching for the basic arrow costs 4 gold for components
for 100 arrows (dmg 1 rng 50) and you will use a lot of them.
