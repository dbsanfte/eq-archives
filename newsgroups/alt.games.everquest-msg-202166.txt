Tailoring should be up to about 80 to really do well with padding.  35
will do it but you will lose lots of hides.

I've made tons of plat with padding.  Occassionally it won't sell
right away but I've always sold out within a week or so.

Now silk swatches I can sell out in about an hour.

Another good one is acrylia.  Sometimes it doesn't sell very fast but
after a couple weeks, someone will come in and clean me out.  Made 4K
on acrylia off mobs in Dawnshroud that I was fighting for Exp anyway. 
The tribals there will occassionally drop acrylia blocks.
