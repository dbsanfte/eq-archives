Well, -I- don't charge for bind/sow or anything else. Not 'old' enough to
port yet, but I doubt I'd charge for that either. As for 'no reply' from
'chanter, *I've* gotten numerous queries for SoW, bind, etc., but they
hardly ever target me and *ask*. If they did, I certainly would be more than
happy to give them what they needed. You said you sent a /tell to a
'chanter.. I rarely ever get this, but when I do, if I'm not
distracted/don't see the message, etc., I always answer, though some people
seldom have patience enough to wait for me to A) answer them, or B) finish
medding, whatever, to answer them.

Patience... should be an ability.

Glad you're happy about the game patches though! I have several characters
who can't bind, port, etc...
