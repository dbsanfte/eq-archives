1) Zone crashes.  Don't get me started on this, omfg!

We go to Tactics, we start the RZtW encounter.  Were making pretty good
progress, mob at 40% or something, and then -
You have been disconnected!

So we log in (into an ass raping from the already-popped mobs)

The fake RZ is now down, meaning the event isn't available.

We GY, CR, and look for more targets.

So we head to BoT, buff up, and port in for Agnarr.
Were making pretty good progress, that first fire dude is at 40% or
something with no deaths, all portals down, adds down, and then -
You have been disconnected!

So we log in (into a second assraping by the fully repopped room).
We GY, CR, and realise raiding any more is pointless.

2) Monks FD... /cough

3) Agro is fucked, to hell and back.  I don't think its a ranger-nerf, more
of a total agro fuckup.  Guildie with 16/20(EB) and 17+1/19 weapon couldn't
keep agro from me for shit, all night long.   Guildie SK couldn't keep agro
off a rogue in his group.   Ranger snares mob 10 times, finally gets agro.
Ranger shoots 4 arrows, is immediatly summoned.  GG VI!

Number 1 guild on the server spent like *all* night on Fennin (trivial mob
for them) - they eventually gave up after god knows how many attempts

4) You broke EQW.  Stop it!  Its a better program than your window mode will
ever be, just leave it be!

5) (To match yours) Nothing in the elementals enraged either.  It was great!
