	In one sense that's true.  But it's actually a bit of a red
herring.  

	Additional cost to users:  would you pay $2.00/month for
the assurance that sharks wouldn't ruin an economy?  Two dollars
to ensure that your adventure or your raid won't be interrupted
by unscheduled maintenance?  Two dollars to  ensure that if you turn
in some armor for 20K points on Monday you'll still have 20K points
on Tuesday?  That two dollars a month per user would buy Sony
a million dollars per month of QA.  That's a lot of testing.


	Additional cost to Sony: Effective QA saves money.  That's
a well proven fact.  How much money is impossible for an outsider
to say.  

	Release delay:  Allocating sufficient resources (see 1 above)
and designing effective and efficient procedures can minimize or even 
eliminate such delays.  And if a product is released on schedule but
requires 8 hours of downtime per day for a week before it's useable
did it really make its release date?  What would have happened if Gates
was released on March 10 instead?  Would that 30 days have been a tradeoff
people would have been willing to make for the sake of stability?
