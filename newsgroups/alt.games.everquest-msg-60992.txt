Oh, as for the faction problem, I'd look for ways to increase that faction

before trying this, as Apprehensive rarely works well for quests.  You
could do CB Belt quest, or skellie bone chip quest, or skunk scent gland
quest, or aviak chick talon quest, all good for raising faction in
kaladim.
You could also try getting someone to wolf form you, although there
are places where this gets you killed instead of better liked.  Another
good trick is to start the trade in, then have someone cast invisibility
on you before you press the Give button.  Handing something in breaks
invisible, so its impossible to do this for yourself, but the game only
checks
faction at the instant you hit Give, so getting invis in between starting
the trade and completing it sets your faction at indifferent, which in
most quests is adequate to the task.

Sneak is great for this, as handing things in does -not- break sneak
as long as you don't move...but most clerics don't get sneak!
