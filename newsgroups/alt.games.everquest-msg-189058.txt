Gee,,,I don't even recall us ever grouping for you to make an assessment of
my playing ability =) ...

But, having played a Shaman to 58, Cleric to 53, Druid to 51, SK to 40, and
countless others I've long since deleted, I assure you I understand
mechanics, and the enchanter has by far been the hardest to get this
high...I will guess the first responder is more correct in that it's the
high end game where people think enchanters are overpowered...but then
again, I've read since the beginning of EQ that "if your class can outdamage
mine, you are overpowered"...
