If you wanted to sell services for money as a way of life, you should
have played one of those classes you've expressed buff envy for in
this thread.
But seriously. You have a druid, and whine that you can't make money
by sitting on your ass in PoK? What's wrong with you?

Variety is the spice of life. If the game were to only contain crucial
classes, it'd be a pretty boring place.

>I've played pet cleric for a 66 mage and i can't totally heal his pet. 

And clearly couldn't think of a better way to duo with a 66 mage.

>If I group with a tank, my 'complete' heal is painfully inadequate. 

If you don't know what to do with it, yes. Back when I played, I
almost never found a place where I couldn't function as the only
healer in a group.

Since it's clear that you'd be so much happier playing a cleric and an
enchanter instead of what you're playing, my conclusion is that you
just like whining.
