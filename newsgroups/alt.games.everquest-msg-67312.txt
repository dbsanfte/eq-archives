Hang on a sec.  You dont need to have 2 coppies unless you want to have two
accounts.  One copy will install on multiple machines just fine, you just
can't have both logged on at the same time as you can only have one account
logged on (NOTE account is NOT the same as an installed version of the
software).

(If you and your wife would like to play at the same time, then yes, you
will need two boxes.  If you dont mind sharing an account, then you only
need one box, install it twice and log on to the same account with each,
(only not at the same time).
