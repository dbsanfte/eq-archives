With a bit less rancor. You can pray with your kids before they go to school
, you can pray with them when they get home . You can take them to church
twice on sundays and all holidays. You have access to teach YOUR kids
anytime you desire. Most who advocate religion in schools want access to
other peoples kids since it is easier to get ahold of them when the
goverment is "protecting and teaching them" .

On the other hand all students and parents should have school choice . I
have absolutely no problem with you sending YOUR kids to any private
religious school and having the money the goverment steals to pay for
education to be spent wherever you deem best. The anti religious crowd tends
not to like this though so there moral high ground is highly suspect.
