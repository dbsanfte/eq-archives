Unfortunately, no.

One thing that helps is to look on the "Combat" abilities.
Some items are available for *both* the "Combat" menu *and* the
"Abilities" menu.  For example, Bind Wounds.

Since the Combat menu is usually not as overloaded as the
Abilities menu, it sometimes helps to place, say, "Bind Wounds"
on the Combat menu, which leaves fewer abilities "unkeyed" and
needing one of the 6 Abilities slots.

Furthermore, while you obviously know that /doability 1-6
references the 6 Abilities menu items, be aware that
/doability 7, 8, 9, and 0 reference the four assignable
"Combat" hotkeys, which can be handy.
