Geez, this problem seems to be more prevalent that I'd have thought. 
Well, luckily the process is still pretty simple provided that folks who
plan on losing their passwords keep their account info updated with a
current email address.  All they have to do is follow a few simple
steps...

1 goto http://www.station.sony.com/
2 Access the login window
3 Click on the link for lost  passwords
4 Follow the process and when they receive the temp password log in and
enter a permanent one that they won't forget.

Its not hard, its not complex and only requires a very small bit of
effort on the customers part.  If anyone was stupid enough to go to
court and argue that VI and Sony let them down by not providing a method
of password recovery they can expect to pay costs.
