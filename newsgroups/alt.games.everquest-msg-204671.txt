You restrict yourself to a particular level range in this, because you are
putting a ceiling on what you can realistically aim for.  At least as far as
most people will be concerned.

At a certain point, people will get all they will ever get out of HoT
farming or Kael farming.  Then they want to do Vindi and Velk.  When
everybody has all they will ever get out of Vindi and Velk (and usually
before), they will want to do...  whatever.

As you hit higher and higher content, Sony has made things impossible to do
with lower numbers, particularly lesser equipped lower numbers.  So you have
to add more members to be able to do the content with the next set of
upgrades.  But that either slows you down or you raid more.  By now some
forward thinkers realize that you'll soon have all you want from this set of
mobs and starts looking at the next set.

Rinse and repeat, though there is a cap you can implement, somewhere around
50 people you should be able to do just about anything the game can throw at
you.  Especially if some 2-box clerics.  :)

You weren't in that kind of guild.  You were in a normal non-uber guild that
had ambitious enough people in it to push forward.

Exactly.

You've doomed yourself to have far inferior (though not as bad as it would
have been a while ago) equipment than the rest of your guild for a very long
time.  Particularly for a cleric this will impact your performance. 
Honestly, I don't think it's the worst thing in the world, but I wouldn't
expect them to key up or gear up your alt because you won't play your
cleric.  In my guild it's not even an option generally to play as an alt,
but we were formed as an "uber" guild, so we knew what to expect.  :)

You'll still be able to function as a cleric as well as the 2-boxed ones
that invariably pop up as people get to higher content and see how important
they are, and that's good enough for even elemental level play (though you
could expect to assume the permanent position of spot healer).  That's your
option if you choose to stay in the guild and rejoin the action at that
point (and they let you), or miraculously convince them that you are good
enough at bard to make it worth losing a cleric.

Exactly.

You might browse around some of the class boards.  There have been some long
and in depth threads on what's required to progress past certain levels.  VT
is generally considered a requirement unless you just want to grow huge and
brute force everything.

Perhaps you really want to stay in a 50s-level guild.  G'luck, they more
often than not make the change, or self destruct, though some take a very
long time to do either.
