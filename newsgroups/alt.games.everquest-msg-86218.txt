Yes, you can be teleported between Luclin (the moon) and Norrath for
free.  Of course this requires that you have installed and registered
the Luclin expansion.

It works like this: Go to one of the large wizard spires located
throughout Norrath.  (Greater Faydark and North Karana, for example.)
Hail the teleport scion.  He will tell you what to do.

Once you arrive at the Nexus on Luclin, you can go down the connecting
hallways to find the teleporters that go back to Norrath.
