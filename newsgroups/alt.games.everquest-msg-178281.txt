*sigh* That's a shame, then.  I won't be using it, except perhaps on 
Nova's kitten killer robe (I'm hoping I can get that pink color I've 
been after for so, so, so, SO long...).  

Couple questions: is the tint permanent?  If I dye, say, my arms black, 
will they never be transparent again?  Is it previewable?  Can I make 
sure the tint color I've chosen will look okay before I blow one of 
those mysterious 'expendable magical components'?  Will non-LoY users 
see the new tints but not be able to use them, or just not be able to 
see them at all?  I seem to recall quite a few people fussing about how 
they got a really nice look with the newer graphics, then happened to 
see themselves without the graphics and realized they looked horrible.

And why do those characters make me think of Sims models? ;p  I keep 
expecting to see the Barbarian whimper and pee on the floor any moment 
now.

Not that I'm asking you specifically, mind you.  Just a few things that 
I'd like to know.
