I've only been on 3 or 4 of each, and I'm a Wizard, so I just stand back and
nuke, but the General seemed more pansy than Fay.  3 of the 4 Fay raids
wiped, in fact.  I don't think I've seen a General raid wipe, and I don't
think the General AoEs.

This could be due to the fact that General raids seem to draw a lot more
people, so the poor General is up against an overwhelming force.  The
location definitely is easier to get to than Fay's.  Also, since you can
repeatedly trigger the General, all the raids I've been on have been for at
least three Rogues, all of whom have brought their friends, so they end up
being effectively joint raids of several guilds.
