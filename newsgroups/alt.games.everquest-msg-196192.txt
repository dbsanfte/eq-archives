Just curious, but which Luclin era models are more absurdly sexually
drawn than original models?

With the possible exception of barbarians, I think it's close to a
zero sum game.  I know hummies in chain and half elves in pretty much
anything are quite a bit less provocative with the new models.  And a
lot of the armor is less form fitting now than it was then.  Just
wondering.  I can understand someone claiming all the models being
drawn absurdly, but to differentiate between old and new, I'm just not
seeing it.
