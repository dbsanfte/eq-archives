not sure about creating an erud necro ... I'll logon and give that a try in 
a few ... but you're right about having access to PoK .. they added access 
to it for everyone a few patches ago.

incidently I've noticed that you can see how long your pets buffs have to 
run by hovering the mouse pointer over the buff icon ... can't remember 
reading that this had been added although I've been away a few weeks myself 
so I could have missed a few patches :)
