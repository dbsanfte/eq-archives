While travel TO your target is certainly easier than it once was (and 
playing on Combine, I mean than it was last week before POK opened), 
wizards still are by far the best at helping you travel FROM your target.

Druids and wizards both can port you out of wherever you are, getting 
you to your next target a lot faster than walking out and then hooking 
into the POK/magus system.

They can also Evac/Succor you out back to the zone line in case of 
emergencies, allowing for a much faster restart than wipe, summon 
bodies, and get back to the zone on foot.

Wizards have it over druids in this regard, as they get numerous TL's 
which let them send individuals out; a raid sized force can get out of a 
deep deep raid spot (say Trakanon for example) with just one wizard, but 
will require a druid per group, or to have the druid bind in place and 
shuttle out one group at a time.

Wizards also are competitive on DPS with mages, despite what it may seem 
to you, because on some targets, mages aren't able to deliver much nuke 
damage at all due to resists; with a wide variety of nuke types, and 
with lures, its much more likely that a wizard CAN do damage.  The melee 
damage off of pets is nothing to sneeze at, but its comperable to that 
of poorly geared warriors, not to rangers/monks/rogues, in most cases, 
and there are instances where it dwindles down to hardly anything at all.

There are, to be sure, times when a mage is going to be more useful than 
a wizard, all I'm saying is, there are also times when a wizard is more 
useful than a mage, and thats as it should be.
