Oh, bother!  Of course, I was hurrying to finish the trophies that
I could (some of them required ridiculously rare components, which
was also fixed in this update), so I've already turned in the
certificates for my tradeskills that are around 188 or so, so I've
lost my chance to get that additional evolving item xp.

The two for which I had to wait for the update to change the items
required, are the ones where my skill is 252 and 300, of course, so
there's no significant additional xp to be gained on those.

I'll have to check the boards at eqtc; I'll bet a lot of people are
in the same boat^H^H^H^Htranslocator gnome.
