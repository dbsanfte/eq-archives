Oh thats great then <g>.  It seemed as though you were saying that there
was no need to respect others until they had earned it.  I don't have
more respect for a lvl 60 than I do for a lvl 1 until  either of them
gives me a reason to have either more or less respect for them.  I just
am a firm believer in respecting others, not in some awestruck bowing
and scraping fashion,  just a general sense of having consideration for
them.  Now by clearing that up and not calling me a poopy head for
making my point you have regained my respect <G>.
