hmm, that WinXP connection hs me worried. My bazaar trader has the
same problem (and I checked by having an underlying window open, it's
not rebooting the machine, just crashing EQ) on both XP machines. 
Started at the same time the "cursor in the middle of my screen" bug
from early Luclin was back.  Lets hope todays patch took care of it.
