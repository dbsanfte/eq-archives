I've got three characters who are all crafters. In one sweep SoE has taken 
away one of them (Alchemist), whilst also runing the entire tradeskill 
community.

No longer will I see a need to chat and make friends with fellow crafters, 
the community is now going to be ruined as everyone will craft for 
themselves.

Fighters have been made more like tanks than tanks/dps characters which is 
good, but sadly the scouts have been screwed over at the same time. Great 
news for magic users though 300% increase in effecitivness.

I'm simply amazed at SoE with this patch, it really does make me wonder if 
they listen at all to the community.
