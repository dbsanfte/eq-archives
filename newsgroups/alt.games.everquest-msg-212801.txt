The long answer is, nothing definitive has been done in terms of
testing, so it's hard to say.  As always, the people who are the loudest
(or say anything at all) are the people who are having trouble, but
there really hasn't been a lot of that either that I've seen, so who knows.

The short answer is, no one knows.
