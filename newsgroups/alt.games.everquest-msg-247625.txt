I remember during the "Fabled" mobs spawning, I was in Najena for FJboots,
and everyone was going by a set list of who got the boots next, well, sure
enough, someone didn't want to wait on the 30 person list, and these two
monks (members of one of a time guild no less) somehow managed to kill the
mob and take the boots.  About 30 petitions went flying in, and sure enough
a guide showed up(I was a bit suprised too!), asked several times in OOC if
anyone disagreed with the list, and then proceed to escalate the petition to
a GM, and remove the two monks from the zone.
