> What class is the most underpowered?

I did a poll on a number of class specific boards asking various classes to
rate their abilities in a number of different areas like soloability,
grouping ability, raiding ability, ability to make money with innate skills,
ability to farm, self reliance and a few others.

The classes that were the most unhappy were monks and warriors.  Bard,
Druids, Shamans and Wizards were the happiest and the others were in
between.

I did not poll Enchanters or Rangers because I could not find a site for
them.
