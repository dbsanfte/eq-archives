Banded armor is strictly inferior to many armours that are even easier 
to obtain and cost *less*. By what standard is Banded armour a success?

substandard armour nobody should wear, because better can be had for less.

A master craftsman would identify and discard or fix crappy materials at 
the outset. A grand master crafstman would make that flaw into a feature.
