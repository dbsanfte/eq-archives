One of the saddest things I ever saw was on the docks in the Oasis.  A
pretty elfin enchantress had bound herself on the dock.  She was even on the
dock when the SG attacked.  After she died, she had the unfortunate luck to
come back right in front of the marauding SG.  A  total of 7  times! I was
horrified as I looked upon the scene from the side of the island close by
(my favorite spot to run to in the Oasis when I hear that the SGs or spooks
are training the dock).
