That's fine for now. You could try getting Forest Loops (AC: +2 Agi: +3 Dex: +3 
Wis: +3). Various giants drop them (rare), check 
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1926 for the listing of 
giants. Some are easier than others, though the drop rate stays constant. You 
could also buy one in bazaar, usually right around 300pp though. It has the 
same wisdom as your current earring so I'd look for other equipment upgrades 
first.

>Neck: 	Lesser Talisman of Wistfulness  AC 2 cha wis int 3
Try for a Chrysoberyl Talisman (AC: +5 Wis: +3 Mana: +20 - Affliction Haste 
II). The Minotaur Elder in Lower Guk drops it (common), or you can buy them in 
the bazaar usually. I got mine for 175pp. 

>Face: 	Acryllia studed Mask   
Sounds good, it's better than a Silver Ruby Veil (someone suggested you get one 
in another thread...).

>Head: 	Savants Cap AC 2 int wis 3  		Reagent Conservation 2
Check for an Othmir Fur Cap in the bazaar (AC: +3 Agi: +2 Dex: +3 Wis: +6 Cold 
Resist: +4 HP: +7). Great stats, though they tend to cost a bit. No graphic on 
it, so everyone can see your cute floppy hair and bright pretty eyes ;)

>Finger: 	Moonstone Ring str 3 mana 30	Extended Range 2
>Finger: 	Ruby Electrum Str 4 Wis 2
Check in to a couple of Platinum Jasper Rings (Wis: +6). They're crafted, so 
your best bet is to buy some in the bazaar. ER2 seems helpful, but +6wis might 
be more helpful (with snare  us druids don't have much trouble staying away 
anyhow :P )  +6wis even at level 30 will amount to more mana than the +30 on 
the item. If you want to stick with that item then just grab one of these rings 
to replace the Ruby Electrum.

>Wrist: 	Coterie Wristbands AC 6 int 1 HP 3  svf -1
>Wrist: 	Polished Bone Bracelet AC 2 int wis 3 Affliction Efficiency I
Polished bone bracelets do well (AC: +2 Wis: +3 Int: +3 - Affliction Efficiency 
I), maybe see about getting one more. Good Wis on them and the AE1 can help at 
times. For example I've found when fighting gnolls that I can do better with my 
mana by using snare rather than ensnare, because the AE1 lowers the mana cost 
(which already is less than half for snare than for ensnare). It doesn't last 
as long but at less than half you're saving mana even if you cast it twice (I 
didn't see a higher resist rate for these gnolls either).

>Arms: 	Ulthork Hide Arms AC 8 dex -3 wis 3
'Tis ok, the 3wis is comparable to the Platinum Armband I wear (Str: +3 Wis: +3 
- Mana Preservation I). You've already got MP1 on another item, so if you want 
to stick with what you're wearing then the -dex isn't hurting too much (when 
did a druid ever need dex? :P )

>Hands: 	Split Paw Hide Gloves AC 4 dex 3 wis 2
Considering how easy these are to get and how cheap they sell for they're 
actually quite good. I'd stick with them for now.

>Shoulders: Braided Ivy Cords  +4 AC +5 Wis	Enhancement Haste I
Great item, been wearing mine since they were donated some time ago.

>Chest: 	Ulthork Hide Tunic +13 AC +3 Wis -5 Cha -35 HP +35 Mana
Hmm, -35hp isn't so great, but +35mana is helpful. I wear a Foreman's Tunic 
currently (AC: +10 Str: +3 Wis: +3), but it has no extra mana and yields the 
same wisdom.

>Back: 	Mamoth Hide Cloak AC 7 wis4 svc 5 	Improved Damage I
A good item.

>Waist: 	Crystalline Belt AC: 5 Agi: 3 Wis: 3 HP: 10
Also a good item.

>Legs: 	Drake-hide Leggings AC 5 dex cha 5
Though fairly expensive (3-500pp) the Gatorscale Leggings are good (AC: +7 Wis: 
+4 HP: +15).

>Feet: 	Kobold Hide Boots AC 5 agi 3 HP 10 	Extended Affliction 2
Keep these, EA2 helps with our lovely DoTs :)

>Primary: 	Koada'Dal Falchion of Tunare 7/24 str wis 3
The wisdom bonus is good. We're not in the fray too often aside from attacking 
enemies in the back as they try to flee snared. The Icepaw War Claw I use (9/24 
- Agi: +3) is a better melee weapon, but no wisdom bonus as with yours.

>Secondary: Testament of Vanear  wis mana 10  mana preservation I
No words necessary :)

>Range: 	Small Wisdom Deity wis 2
Helpful, but you could check bazaar search for other range items with a better 
wisdom bonus.

I'm fairly new to EQ, so I'm sure others have better advice for items. Check on 
Allakhazam for any items people suggest if you want to try hunting them down 
yourself. The bazaar is a great place to upgrade eq, but it's easy to burn 
through platinum in there :) When I first went to the bazaar I picked up items 
here and there simply because they were cheap and far better than the pretty 
stock issue things I was wearing. At one point my agility was almost as high as 
my wisdom lol. Once I got more money over 5-8 levels I picked up more equipment 
that was wisdom oriented.

I would suggest you check out Allakhazam's ( http://everquest.allakhazam.com ) 
character information section. You can input your character, your base stats, 
hp, and level, and then select what equipment you're wearing. It will then tell 
you what your new stats and hp are, as well as total mana. The mana part is 
very nice as it shows your base mana, mana from +mana items, and mana from +wis 
items. Using that you could choose various combinations of equipment people 
have suggested in here and see which one would likely be what you want. Then 
you'll easily see the effects of any equipment combos you might want without 
having to buy it or manually figure things out (especially for mana).
