A better question to ask me personally would be what I'm *not* looking
forward to in EQ2, because there are too many exciting things about it to
name one or two.  (And yes, there is only one thing about EQ2 so far that
makes me uneasy, which is the 4-6 group focus.) I am not, however, the
norm on this NG, and I'd suggest this is the wrong group of people to pose
that question to. :)  Go to www.everquest-2.com and you'll get a different
response.

And no, you cannot be a blacksmith without being an artisan as far as I
know.  Did you know that one of the artisan sub-classes will be a
linguist? That being a linguist will actually be useful?  

And did you know that there are no longer just guilds, but guilds,
families, and fellowships?  *points to the link above*  Go there.  Read
the FAQs and summaries. Lots and lots of information out there. 

Ok, I shut up now. :) You old crankimuffins don't want to listen to my
version of Hope Lives Eternal. I'm sure it'll disillusion me sooner or
later, but I'd prefer "later" right now, because I'm burned-out (again) on
EQ.
