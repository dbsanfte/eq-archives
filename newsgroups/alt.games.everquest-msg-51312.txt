Darn. Beat me to it. Although the basement would be better for EXP at 20.

Ahh Unrest. Allow me to wax poetic a moment...

Grand Central Station. The most vicious trains you'll ever see, but also
excellent loot+exp for the level. For a 20 warrior just getting there is
half the battle. Dagnar's Cauldron is no picnic for the unwary. Most of
the gobbies will con even or blue and if you get more than one on you,
just type /loc and try to get down to the shoreline before you die.

If you can keep your wits about you the trains in Unrest aren't really
-that- bad. Make sure you have an enchanter or at the least, someone that
can root or snare. One almost dead mob pulled to the courtyard that gets
away from you is a guaranteed PC-blender train in about 30 seconds. Just
start running. Don't wait for it, don't think it's not going to happen,
don't think you can -handle- it... just hike up your skirts and run.
