Ranger just blind would be the answer, found him there later,
and I"m pretty sure his location was outside the track range of an
18 ranger doing a "run around the lake" sweep.  Ah well, too
used to my 49 ranger buddy, who spots things at the QH zone
line when he zones in to WK from NK.

Another place where research would have paid off, having come
all this way to Oasis, I find out that what the fellow wants isn't
the beverages I was told to bring at all, but rather something
I have to go to Unrest to get ingrediants for.  Back across the
ocean, walk into Unrest, kill two mobs (hey, at least they were
both up) and then -back- to Antonica, with a side trip to
Kith, and another to WFP to pick up ingrediants for the
snack the guy also wanted, and I'm done.

Well, no I"m not, since I then went -back- to Kaladim and
got a replacement Initiates symbol.  I'm really enjoying the
endless supply of Brell's Blessed Stout, I hand out a stack with
every trade, drink it while sitting around for protracted inactions,
put it on likely looking mobs that don't aggro on me for people
to find... its good stuff too, I can only quaff 19 in a row before
the bedspins get me.  But the Initiates symbol gives me a free
10 point str buff I slap on passing newbies for grins, and on
party members to increase the number of "useless" buffs they
have on protecting their real buffs from cancellation.  Sure, the
tanks likely have much better str buffs overwriting me or bouncing
me off, but the casters rarely have str buffs running.  I'm much
happier with it casting an effect I can't duplicate, than I would
be if it did something lame like Armor of Faith... (I know, there's
at least a theoretical benefit to the Valor line buff in an item,
although I'll argue that the Daring helm is a waste of potential
with a real Cleric in your group.  I'd rather see the higher total
HP than the potential "free" heals that eat valuable med time.
Paladins already go thru mana twice as fast as I do, and on a
smaller supply!)
