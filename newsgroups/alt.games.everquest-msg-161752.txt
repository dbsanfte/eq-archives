His facts are wrong too.  It was widely reported that a complete recount had
been done as mandated by Florida law the first thing, but it wasn't a LARGE
number of counties only ran their undercounts through the machines again,
and never did a full recount, whether deliberately or through
misunderstanding of what they were supposed to do, I'm not sure.

You kind of pick up these facts if you watch the news on a subject longer
than the few days while it's on the front page.

The fact is that NO complete recount was done, either by hand or by machine,
until the press did it after Bush had already been installed..
