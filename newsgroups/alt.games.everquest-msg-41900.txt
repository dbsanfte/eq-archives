As someone who spent the last week camping the AC in OoT, I feel your 
pain...I was camping it with a cleric from my guild, 6 hours the first 
night, then 14, then 8 more hours with no luck...everytime we gave it up 
we heard they got the AC less than an hour later...

Finally on Wednesday we took the camp from a friend that said she just 
looted the ring, so we figured we would be in for another long 
night...within an hour, the first AC popped, and only 20 minutes after 
that  we got another one! After a week of hell, we now have our JBoots! 
Woooo!

Keep your head up, soon you have yours!
