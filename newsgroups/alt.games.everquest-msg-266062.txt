I seem to recall that there were incentives to pre-order EQ2, like in-game
items?  If so, are these items *only* available to pre-orders, or are they
things that anyone can get (or get equivalents) through normal in-game
mechanisms that aren't unreasonably difficult?

If pre-order people get some noticable, permanent advantage over non-preoder
people, that might help me decide to go with WoW instead of EQ2.
