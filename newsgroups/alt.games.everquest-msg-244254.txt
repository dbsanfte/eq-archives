I use TW all the time in Ldons,normal and hard,no problems or 
complains so far,and in some groups,especially when my 
damage shield is needed,I dont mem snare or ensnare,because
8 spellslots is not sufficient.
I cast TW at around 35% mob health,18 seconds is a long time
in this case,usually I cast a nuke right after TW,cause damge
is a little more reliable from nukes than from archery.

You're right,my bad.

Not sure,but I think after the last patch,you can now only hit the 
targeted mob with an arrow.
