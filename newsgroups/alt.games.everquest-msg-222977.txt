My understanding is that Neh'Ashir can still drop the torch for the mage 
epic, even after handing in the ring.

The old method of using a mage with a fire pet to take down Rak'Ashir is 
no longer as fool proof as it used to be.  It can still work.  
Personally, from my experience of doing Rak several times after the 
change, I would not use the mage pet method, but rather, one or two tank 
types with high FR.  I like using an SK or Paladin as he can grab the 
agro very fast, thus potentially keeping the shaman from being killed.  
Have one cleric or high level druid for each of your tanks, or, depending 
on level and equipment, just one healer period.

I attempted Rak two times for myself using the multiple mages with fire 
pets method, both times failed horribly, as the fire pets went down very 
fast.  I have done it since then several times with an SK and a Ranger 
meleeing Rak, with one healer for each of them, both were level 65 at the 
time, FR was 200+.  I have done it with just one healer for both melee 
types that were fighting as well.

I would guess that it can be done with just 3 people, cleric or druid, 
shadowknight or paladin, and shaman, if all are high enough level, and 
well enough equipped.  Shaman is only there to do the turn in, Rak is 
basically 100% MR.
