Riding around with my girlfriend (whom I should mention plays UO and is
going to start playing EQ with me, see previous posts on that subject) we
were driving around a town we didn't know that well and we kept having to

(14)"  She was like, "What?"  I said, "Play EQ with me and you'll know what
I'm talking about.
