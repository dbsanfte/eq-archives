OK, but thats the arguement.  You wanted to know what the benefit
of simplicity is in this case, here it is.

You can go back to trying to prove that although He's inscrutable
you still have to pay attention to what people say about him... but
IF I'm right, then you get this result.

Of course it doesn't mean that they WILL do so, but it
does mean that they SHOULD give up trying to do so, since
they are trying to do something that is impossible.

If what they are trying to do is -not- impossible, then the
statement "God cannot be explained in human terms" will
no longer be true.   People can happily while away their
time trying to explain God in human terms, even inventing
new terminology or new ways of thinking in order to do
so, as long as they don't try to simultaneously insist that
what they are doing is impossible.  One or the other, or...
happily work on a useless project which you may nonetheless
enjoy for some reason other than logic.

You can discuss Him, just everything you say either contradicts
the "God cannot be explained in human terms" or is wrong,
your choice  (or happens to be right but there is no way to
distinguish those coincedental correctnesses from your many
errors...if there -is- a way to distinguish them then you
are again violating the "GCBEIHT" rule.

You can discuss it, but your discussion is free of meaning
on a real basis, its all mere theory... perhaps the derivation
of THEOlogy?  Probably not just looks funny there.

I'm not sure I'm willing to concede this.  Discussion of
theoretical deities and their attributes is all well and good
but if... hmm, looking back up for the root of this, we've clipped
the place where the word explanation came in.

T:Perhaps God cannot be explained in human terms.

So, it seems to me you brought the explaination arguement up
in the first place here, attempting to wriggle out of logical
discussion altogether.  My point was that either you
can discuss God -or- you cannot, again I'm using the
handy Dilemna construction so beloved of Aristotle and
Socrates... Do you want

Horn A: We can explain God, so I can't dismiss the arguement
based on God not being explainable

Horn B: We can't explain God, so -all- discussion of Him is
futile

You are trying to wriggle in between the two horns by stating that
Discussion  is not the same as Explaination.  Let me dig around
some more and see if I can find either the spot where I either worked
that trick or where one of us used the two terms as interchangable.

Here it is:
L:If God (or any given creator) cannot be explained in human terms,
L:then any discussion of Him is essentially meaningless, and its simpler
L:to proceed as though He does not exist, after all, anything which
L:has been said of Him is no more than white noise, and you cannot base
L:any actions on any of it.

OK, so here we are.  Discuss all you like, but its meaningless since
none of the parts of your discussion where you explain even the least
little thing about God are meaningfull.  Since you have no facts, no
Axioms, you cannot reason to any conclusions.  You can only state
some "if-then" cases about theoretical Gods who may or may not
exist, and even then you need to keep firmly in mind that it is impossible
for your "if-then" cases to apply to any real Gods.  (Or you need to swap
horns and stop trying to get out of the first arguement by introducing
this inscrutability arguement, which was the point of the exercise in the
first place.  Reductio ad Absurdem)

No, I'm drawing a line in the sand here.  If he meant it, then
he did.  If he was working in mysterious ways, then he did
-not- mean it.  Or he Did.  If he meant part of it, then he
didn't mean it at all.  Not like Adam ate the Whole Thing
(that was Meadowlark, or perhaps the guy who was "born
about ten thousand years ago" split it with him)

Aha, just as I am going in a slippery fashion from Explained
to Discussed (but I put it to you that I did construct and arguement
for why you can't meaningfully discuss things that Cannot (not merely
aren't) be explained), you are going from "Explained to Described"

If I'm sitting around sawing some wood in my workshop (Vrooba
Vrooba Vrooba) and I hear the famous EQ Ding and a booming
voice saying LANCE... well heck you know the routine.  Anyway
while I may or may not obey that voice, the second I turn around
and try to tell you about it you are hit with a problem.  Either I'm
talking gibborish, or I'm EXPLAINING something to you... his
Ding noise.  His booming Voice.  The whole "whats a Cubit" thing.
Either I can't do that, or I can.  And if I can... then you picked
horn A of the dilemna.

Probably still needs hammering on, find the slippery bits where
I used two similar words which share one meaning but may
have other contradictory meanings as well, find the loose
definitions... heck, maybe the whole thing doesn't hold
water.

BUT If it doesn't hold water we have a Babel Fish arguement
so we -still- win (and God vanishes in a puff of logic)

Now that I try and pry them apart, though, I see where the
second one came in; a classic way out of all logical proofs
of anything which seems tricky in religious arguement is
to fall back on the "God is a mystery" defense.  Have to
puncture that one, or all other arguements about God
collapse.  If I can force either the acceptance of arguements
as valid, -or- the acceptance of the premise that -no-
arguements are valid, then I see that as a win-win.  And
if I were a proponent of religion, I'd be picking the "we
can discuss this stuff after all" horn -real- fast.

You say tomato, Quail says tomatoe...  but seriously,
I think you either can't use this to stop my other arguement,
or else you have to throw out the Baby Jesus with the
bathwater.
