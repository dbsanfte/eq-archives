I was wondering who you were meaning by "rules lawyers". To Zeller: What
could be considered exploitiong the guards is the act of having it do most
of the work and then rooting it so you can finish off the mob and get the
exp. Of course, the only way to find out if this is an acceptable strategy
is to let a GM/Guide know you're doing it and see what ensues.
