Nor do I. But neither do I play multi player games to listen to a
constant stream of retards talk about the football game they're
watching, argue over which teen pop star is the coolest, or
demonstrate their command of doodspeek.

That's a lovely theory, but the only way it works is to shut them
*all* off, since there are always idiots who think their chances of
selling something are better if they shout it instead of auction, and
invariably, these idiots devolve into petulant little asswipes if
someone dares suggest they use the appropriate channel.
