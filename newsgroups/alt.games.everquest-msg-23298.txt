}It depends on who you ask.  I was always taught that punctuation always goes
}inside quotations.

Odds are, no one really cares, but I always found this excerpt from 
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/Hacker-Writing-Style.html 
particularly enlightening on this issue anyway.

Hackers tend to use quotes as balanced delimiters like parentheses, much 
to the dismay of American editors. Thus, if "Jim is going" is a phrase, 
and so are "Bill runs" and "Spock groks", then hackers generally prefer to 
write: "Jim is going", "Bill runs", and "Spock groks". This is incorrect 
according to standard American usage (which would put the continuation 
commas and the final period inside the string quotes); however, it is 
counter-intuitive to hackers to mutilate literal strings with characters 
that don't belong in them. Given the sorts of examples that can come
up in discussions of programming, American-style quoting can even be 
grossly misleading. When communicating command lines or small pieces of 
code, extra characters can be a real pain in the neck. 

Consider, for example, a sentence in a vi tutorial that looks like this: 

     Then delete a line from the file by typing "dd". 

Standard usage would make this 

     Then delete a line from the file by typing "dd." 

but that would be very bad -- because the reader would be prone to type 
the string d-d-dot, and it happens that in vi(1) dot repeats the last 
command accepted. The net result would be to delete two lines! 

The Jargon File follows hackish usage throughout. 

Interestingly, a similar style is now preferred practice in Great Britain, 
though the older style (which became established for typographical reasons 
having to do with the aesthetics of comma and quotes in typeset text) is 
still accepted there. "Hart's Rules" and the "Oxford Dictionary for
Writers and Editors" call the hacker-like style `new' or `logical' 
quoting. This returns British English to the style many other languages 
(including Spanish, French, Italian, Catalan, and German) have been using 
all along.
