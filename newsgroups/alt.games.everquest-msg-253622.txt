Hi all,

I was in Nektulos Forest checking out the Arcane guys so that I can
get some blood drenched cloaks for my Enchanter newby armour when I
noticed something very odd.  I wanted to see if the spell Illusion:
Human would change the con message from ready to attack to something
less nasty.  I targetted and conned a red Elementalist and it was
ready to attack.  I cast Illusion: Human and he changed from a red to
a yellow!  Does this mean I'm tougher as a human?  (I'm a Dark Elf by
birth)
