True, but I was leaving east and west out of it, at least until New Mexico and Arizona
got mentioned. Splitting the U.S. between purely north and south, California would
probably be both. As for Maryland... *shrug*  I live right next door to it, and have
plenty of friends that live in it. I don't think it counts as the South. But I imagine
you could find little pockets of the South in just about every state, if you look hard
enough.
