Let's assume he's not trolling and making fun of the other addicted 
dumbasses (like me). That type of messages is very common in support groups 
for, say, losing weight or quitting smoking or drinking and other stuff that 
addicted dumbasses (like me) do.

Apparently the OP feels the need to cement his decision to quit here, now he 
can't post here tomorrow asking for good solo places or whatever.

I've never preached about the way I quit to anyone in the EQ commmunity, 
instead I explained to my few remaining friends the full and devastating 
impact the game had had on me, so they could stop me from going back.

The short version is that I lost my job and girlfriend for EQ. I couldn't 
work normally because I was up until dawn playing, so they eventually asked 
me to pack up my stuff and go home. Later that day I intentionally provoked 
an argument with my (very patient) girlfriend so she ran crying to the train 
station never to return. Now, I had all the time in the world to play, and 
felt strangely satisfied...


EQ is addictive and there are a lot of addicted dumbasses (like me),
Keep it up, Mike, you can do it! =)
