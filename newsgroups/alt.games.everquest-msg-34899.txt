Yep, specters are a dream target for clerics, too, we have
better fears (longer lasting, generally) and what most clerics
lack in melee firepower (at specter levels I out-melee damaged
most paladins I grouped with) they make up for in powerful
and quick cycling anti-undead DDs.

I know there's a good single spawn in Feerrot, but I used to
instead hunt in Oasis cleaning up after the sloppy pulls off
the island.  Bad pulls there are not an event, they are
so frequent as to be a reliable source of exp mobs.  Just
root one to split it off from the rest, run the others to the
S Ro zone area and lose em there, go back for your pick and
fear him, then nuke till root breaks and start hammering.

In no time you are the hero of dozens of hapless teenies,
who will happily tell you where the next spectre is lurking,
while cursing the name of the original pullers.
