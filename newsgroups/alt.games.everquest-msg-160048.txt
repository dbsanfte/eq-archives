Maybe they're half elf, half dwarf.

Frankly, I think the limitation on half-elf cultural stems from if they can
do one of the parent racial cutural things, why can't they do them all? It's
very difficult to put the limits in the coding saying "Ok, you were born in
Qeynos you can only do THIS type of half-elf cutlural". Otherwise, someone
would make a half elf just for the sole purpose of being able to make human,
dwarven, elven, dark elven etc cultural, and nothing could stop them. And
there is nothing unifying about half-elves themselves that gives them a
unique culture.
