  Translation:  SOE has alot of money, because you people are paying to play
it.  Since we are a small operation that has no cash flow, we have to spam in
order to get known.  Since you are willing to pay our competitor, we get to
advertise for free in your newsgroup.

   Thanks for sending out spam.  We know it's spam, as we're already said.

   Yes, we spam.  But we don't do it alot, here.  It's your own fault because we
have no money and you gives yours to Sony.

   Not all publicity is good.  I was willing to give you the benefit of a doubt
before, but now I think your just a weasel.

> And if you get bored of EQ, then please try us out.

   Nope.
