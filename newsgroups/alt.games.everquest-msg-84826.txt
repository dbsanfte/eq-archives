it does/you can.

You can move 8 chars from ANY live servers (even pvp, fv etc.. since
it doesn't say you can't) to this server, intact. You can also still
play all the live servers.

If you then decide you don't like it, you cancel but still can play as
normal for that month until next paytime, then you start paying the
9.89 per month again and your chars go back to the servers they came
from, no harm no foul. 

Pretty nice system really.
