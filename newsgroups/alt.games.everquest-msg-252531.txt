Instead of making armor, look up a 39+ mage and get donate
a few plat for a set of summoned plate.  Also look in the
bazaar for Girdle of Magi'kot and a pair of either Fist
of Ixiblat, Sword of the Kedge or Blade of Walnan.  (should
run you a total of 15pp per set of 1 girdle, 2 weapons).

They add a total of 600 hp.
