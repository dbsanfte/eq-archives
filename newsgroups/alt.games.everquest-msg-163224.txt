If you are going to do it.. go for your primary stat.. lots of it. 200+ is a
godsend.
It will save you 10s of thousands of plat to go from 150 stat to 225 stat.
(misty picnic +5, qeynos tea +5, remember that)

Don't bother with 16..  No mana vials are required, nor is silver unless you
are insane and do ornate chain (plat sink). The adamantite enchant is level
49. In fact, I probably wouldn't do an enchanter. I would browse and see
what 'cheap' int or wis or str gear is out there in the bazaar and make
whatever class looks easiest to twink up that stat. Example there is a +7
int earring mage only that generally sells for like 100pp on my server...
elemental binders (+5 ? int) go for 5-10pp

Remember, the highest of int wis or str is what you are looking for, nothing
else matters (except some chr).

As far as making money back:
The good news is getting to the point of making banded is cheap. The bad
news is that the banded market is GONE. People who have no money buy Fine
Steel for their twinks. Fine Steel is expensive in time (need padding), but
will take you to 188. Beyond that you have two choices: Acrylia, or
Cultural. Both are going to be more wealth than I can imagine. And as Han
said, I can imagine quite a bit. Acrylia plate breastplates trivial at 242.
beyond that cultural takes you to 250. Your armor you want is not yet
trivial at 250.
Fine Steel has tanked on my server. I don't make enough off my fine steel
skillups to justify putting them on the bazaar mule except he had the space
available.
Ornate chain is faster than FS if you do an enchanter and level him to 16
(for the silver), but the money goes away a lot faster, and noone wants to
wear it except maybe to weddings (I've had a commission order for a full
suit of visible platinum ornate chain for the best man at a wedding. Guy
called me off after I had made 4 pieces, because the wedding had just been
postponed indefinitely. At least he bought them from me anyway. )

I figure the cost of parts for a breastplate attempt is around 2k-3k,
depending on blue diamond prices on your server. I understand the failure
rate is around 3 fails out of 5 attempts. All in all I'd say, unless you are
swimming in plat, find someone that makes it and buy a set.
