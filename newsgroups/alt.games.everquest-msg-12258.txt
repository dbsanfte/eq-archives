You're about at the perfect level to hunt willowisps; they'll
be low blue to you now, maybe some high green. Greater lightstones
are about the best source of cash at that level. You can hunt them
in Erud's Crossing (close to home for a Barb), North Karana (where
the gypsy is to whom you turn them in, just be wary of griffons
et al), East or West Commonlands, or a few other places.

Note that you do need a magic weapon to hit willowisps.
