Which is why I said *almost* better :)  I'm not into Futurama or
Sliders, but Simpsons and Drew Carey redeem that network all by
themselves.

Of course they'd do it a lot faster if they'd replay the Drew Carey
RHPS episode again when I happen to watch.  I have a clip of that on
my computer just to amuse myself with now and again.
