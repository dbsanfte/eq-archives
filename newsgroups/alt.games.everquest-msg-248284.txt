Hi, I am a lurker, I am having a problem which is a real head scratcher and
hope that you guys may be able to help.
I can't see the new login screen, only the old one with the high elf girly
in blue. I can't see many other people in chat, no GM's at all (someone told
me that they changed chat in the patch on the 19th). Also due to all of this
I reinstalled everquest and re-ran the patcher with everything exept for LoY
and GoD (which I don't have) downloading.
once this had downloaded I got the may 12th patch message, I am almost sure
this means that I haven't downloaded the latest patches but as the patcher
isn't downloading these I don't know what to do next!
Someone on the EQ Tech board told me to check that my files weren't read
only which I did and they were but changing them didn't make a difference.
Please can someone help, I know it doesn't seem like a serious problem but
it's really bugging me and with all the downtime RN has been having lately I
can't even talk to anyone while the servers are down!
Thanks in advance
Ceri :o)
