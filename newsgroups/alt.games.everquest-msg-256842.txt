Found a great buy this morning in Bazaar, ornate chain glove pattern for 
under 5kpp.  Checking Allakhazam, thats a clicky 30% haste plus really 
nice stats, I went for it.  Also grabbed a couple ethereal rings at 
100pp each, and 500 more pp to hand to the guy in POT.

He won't talk to me.

Says I'm not experience enough and don't know enough about the planes.

Further research turns up the fact that I have to be level 55, which is 
bad enough, but that I also have to be tier 3 flagged... which isn't 
likely to happen before I'm in my 60s!

To add insult to injury, later on this evening, Moppsie is chattering 
about having ornate at level 29; playing on my favorite server, Firiona 
Vie, where such things are possible.

I'm tempted to go trader mode and try and double my money selling the 
pattern, but in the long run it seems like something worth keeping for 
some day.
