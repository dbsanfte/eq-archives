Well first off it seems like you get another mouse pad.  Besides that, the
expansions will allow your player to progress to lvl 60, but if you are just
starting out, that probably isn't first on your mind.  Most notably, would
be new hunting areas (if you currently only have the original EQ), the
second expansion "Ruins of Karnark" or something introduce some great spots
to kill (and the playable snake man race)
