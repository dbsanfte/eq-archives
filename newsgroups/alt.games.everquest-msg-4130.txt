I read the thread below, and you gave Mezzmero some good advice which I will
be following myself.  But I have a few questions that I came up with as I
was reading one of the suggested sites.

They said that Dervs and Orcs should NOT be killed.  Is this true?

What is the proper casting order for level 1?  4?

How far can I effectively solo?

Are erudites KoS in Kaladim or should I use Illusion Human or Half-Elf (bone
chip quest with Gunlok Jure).

I'm sure I'll have more, but that's all for now.  Thanks!!
