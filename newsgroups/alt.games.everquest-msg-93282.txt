Thanks for the thorough advice.  I think I'm going to go with
pricewatch.com, as we usually just order the goods and put it all together
ourselves because 1)we can, and 2)no labor costs so it's a lot less
expensive than paying some idiot at a computer store to do the job for us.
lol

We're staying with the GeForce2, updating the processor, we already have
SBLive, and I'll check out the Rambus Ram for sure.
We're definitely on a budget, so we might or might not go with it.
And, we've got a 60g and a 40g HD in our server, one of which is not being
used.  I might just steal it....

anyway, thanks for your suggestions!
