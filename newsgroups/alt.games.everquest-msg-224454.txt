So, having recently hooked up with Winterfury, a 52 shaman, I'm 
presented with a problem.

The reason I restarted on a new server was because an old friend had 
come back to play, and we decided to make a break with our old server 
and all the guild politics there, so we both started clean.

I made a mage, she made a shaman.  We haven't played together as much as 
planned because real life made it difficult, but recently things have 
worked out better.

However, if I'm going to group regularly with Winterfury, and with 
Rzantha (currently 46 shaman), then the issue of what to do with them 
comes up.

Principle shaman jobs are haste, slow, heal, with DPS coming in a 
distant fourth.  But you only need one haster, one slower, and that 
leaves healing and DPS.  Healing might be a legitimate use for two 
shaman, neither is really all that at the job thus far; I think 52 is 
barely Superior Healing level?  Doubling up on heals might be a viable 
plan.

And of course each has a pet, which isn't terrible dps considering its 
practically free.

How about shaman DPS otherwise?  If not slated to doing heals, a cleric 
can actually output respectable DPS in the long run, their burst DPS 
isn't so good because of long cast times and longer recast times, but 
their mana efficiency on their nukes isn't really so bad, and 
considering my mage sustains one or two nukes per fight running thru 
LDoN, the burst DPS thing isn't such an issue.

SHaman, though, get their best Damage efficiency out of DOTs, which 
don't generally function so well in a group.  If we go after tough 
targets, though, the trio could do with my pet as MT, their pets both as 
additional DPS, and DOTs from them.  Or if I level up a bit and get 
water pet, one of their pets could MT, although that would remove one 
healer, I'm frankly not the best healer in that group by a long shot, so 
having me just DS and DD wouldn't be that big a drop in effectiveness.

In a group, we'd be substantial DPS and decent healing, get us a real 
MT, preferably a paladin to supply lulls and still more healing power, 
and we'd still have room for two more DPS, or a DPS and a mezzer.

Doesn't seem like a bad deal really.

Stacking the two shaman with Teapray and Lenny means yet another angle, 
though, three healers is really overkill, so now we need to look at 
whether the shaman or the cleric does the best DPS if we swap them out 
of the healer role.

Funny how building a group out of who you like, instead of what classes 
would be best fit can make you think of things in a new light.
