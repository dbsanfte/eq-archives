When I examine my spells, two icons are shown for most spells.  One is the
icon that appears on the command bar.  The other icon is the one that
appears in the heroic opportunity thingy.

Why two icons?  Is the second shared among multiple spells, so that a step
in a heroic opportunity chain is basically "do any spell that has this
second icon"?
