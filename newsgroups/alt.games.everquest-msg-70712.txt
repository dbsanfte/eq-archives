What do you mean by "beastlord tradeskills"? Do you mean something specific
to the class (like alchemy for shamans) or something that is not beastlord
specific (like tailoring or baking)?

Either way, EQ tradeskills have always had a significant failure rate. Let me
explain. ALL COMBINES have at least a 3% chance of failure, even if the item
trivials at 5 and you have 250 skill. You appear to reach the minimum failure
rate of 3% when you are at 125% of the trivial; in other words, you need to
be at 125 skill to have a 3% failure rate on something that trivials at 100,
and at 250 skill to fail only 3% of the time making something that trivials
at 200. Anything that trivials at higher than 200 will *always* have a higher
than 3% chance of failure, as 250 skill is the max you can reach, and that in
only in ONE skill you first get to 201 (you may reach 200 in all other
tradeskills that are not capped by level like fishing or spell research.)
This means that the chance of failing something that has just become trivial
is always slightly higher than that 3% and that he higher the trivial, the
greater the chance of failure (ie your are more likely to fail a 150 trivial
combine when you are 150 skill than you are a 40 trivial combine at 40
skill.)
