With that machine you should do fine. There will be certain areas in the
game that come across slower then others, such as Innothule Swamp perhaps,
the infamous Warsliks Woods (of course), or the "gates" of Freeport, though
beyond those certain areas you should be fine. It seems like regardless the
system you have, "everybody" experiences slow downs there.

Like the others have said, though, the main thing is your ram. This game is
really, really resource hungry.

Personally, I average out to play much more often with all sound off then
otherwise. So as far as my opinion goes about the sound, you're not going to
miss much with it off. Well, besides those giants' foot-steps... :)

Necro's Main sound experience:
"*hhissssssss*Ahhhhhhhhhhyeeaaahhhh"

heh heh..

But that's better then the "angelic voices" of the Gate / Invis type of
spells. :)
