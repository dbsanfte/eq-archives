Basically, many SK spells have quite a bit of taunt value associated
with them. Disease Cloud is a level 9 spell that costs 5 mana, and
very often turns a mob's attention to the SK all by itself (it's a 5pt
dd with a 2 minute 1/tick DOT). The Darkness line, snare+dot, also
tends to create lots of aggro. Steal strength debuffs the MOBs
strength and gives it to the SK. It also doesn't break mez, which
means that an SK can taunt, steal strength, then use one of their
other high taunt spells to hopefully get on the hate list abovve the
chanter. Once you hit 39, you get shadow vortex,
shroud of pain, and heart flutter, all of which are debuffs that
create a lot of aggro (heart flutter also has a DOT
component). Finally, if you really need it, you have harm touch to put
out a lot of damage quickly, to help taunt off an overburning
caster. With all those tools plus the taunt skill at their disposal, a
good SK can be very effective at picking up aggro.
