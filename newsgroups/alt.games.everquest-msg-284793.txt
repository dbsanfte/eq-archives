The first thing that comes to my mind is that 248mb is almost assuredly not 
enough memory.  Upgrade to 500 at minimum, 1gb for comfort, or 2gb for zoom. 
There may be other parts that are unsuitable (laptops are not generally 
considered good for gaming), but memory is usually the first thing to 
consider.  Apart from that, the 1.6Ghz is a bit slow, and the graphics 
'card' is an unknown variable.
