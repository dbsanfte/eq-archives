Undead do not see through sneak/hide.  I conned the specs wayyyy back 
when they would have had much fun taking one swipe at me and discussing 
how many points of damage were wasted, and they were indiff when I was 
hidden.  And they DEFINITELY see through invis.  My necro got jumped by 
one last night.  Higher levels also do not see through sneak/hide.  They 
have a better *chance* of seeing through, but it's not guaranteed.  I've 
snuck up on many a thing deep red to me to get a better look and never 
been caught.  Only time sneak/hide failed was once in LGuk, and I simple 
backed up, refreshed sneak/hide, checked again to make sure it was 
working, and moved on.
