I seem to have sone something STUPIT! on the game tonight.  All of a 
sudden, my message screen shrunk to an almost unreadably tiny size.  I 
would be sooo appreciative if anyone could share some info regarding how to 
restore it to its proper dimensions (I do a fair amount of chatting with 
the players in my groups, for me it's at least half the fun).
