Also when a mob is pushed into a wrong corner, or simply pushed in the wrong
direction and you need to move it, sitting helps.

Often, whilst you may have full agro in battle (mobs only hitting 1 person),
you don't have enough agro to pull the mob back (you stepback, and he just
hits xxx random people, step back in range, he hits you)
