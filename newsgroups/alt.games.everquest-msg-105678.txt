You really are dense, aren't you?  If you had "displayed ac over 153 *at
level 20* is compared to displayed ac of 59 *at level 20*" your test might
have some merit.  As it stands, it has none.  Zero.  Zip.  Nada.

No need.  My statement was perfectly accurate.  Your post throws red
herrings at straw men and tries to come to a conclusion.
