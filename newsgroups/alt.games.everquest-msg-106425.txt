	No, it's intended to give you something to do when you hit 60.

	NONE of the AA abilities will help you get to 60 better than more levels
will.  When you gain a level you get the following benefits:

	* more hit points
	* more mana, if you use mana
	* you get hit less often, just by virtue of the higher level
	* and you may get a Defense increase as well depending on class
	* you hit mobs more often, just by virtue of the higher level
	* and you may get Offense and weapon skill increases depending on class
	* you resist spells more often, just by virtue of the higher level
	* if you cast spells, including item effects, they will be resisted less 
	  often
	* you will gain a shorter aggression radius against many mobs, which in 
	  turn makes it easier to get single pulls without special tricks
	* depending on class, access to new spells and/or disciplines

	There is nothing on the AA list that is as good as all that.

|indoor area. The 3 regen would be nifty with iksar regen.

	Those are everyone's first choices.  Just wait until 60 to get them.

|It might be a good idea to put at least 20 percent in AA, perhaps up

	It would be stupid to do so.  You will get the points faster if you level
to 60 first and then start working on AA than if you try to pick them up on
the way.
