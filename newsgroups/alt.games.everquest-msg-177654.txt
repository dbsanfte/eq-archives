Expect the same ire from any caster who knows what they are doing, and
you who are obviously inexperienced as a caster go telling them what
they should be doing.  Basicly you start out attacking casters, what are
you expecting?  As well as calling the kettle black:  first you say
"let's stop trying to find exception to everything someone says" then
you go finding exception with what I'm saying immediately after.  If you
don't take your own advice don't expect me to either, or have any
respect for you.

Fine tell that person not to do that, but don't go expecting any love
from others you are telling what to do when you don't know what you are
talking about.

I'll conceede not one of my strong points, tactics and comprehension
are, obviously you are lacking in that department, along with tact.

Not neccessarily.  There are plenty of other situations which you don't
need a sow to make that work.  You've got AA points in run (albeit weak
argument since this can be compared to sow).  The mob is snared.  The
mob is slow to begin with (like golems in the grey).
