Well, popped on and started porting.  FV to Lava went fine, then went to GD
for my own purposes.  I'm just a-trucking to Thurgardin when I get a tell
from someone wanting to go to Skyfire.  I can do that at 39, but it's not
the safest of destinations.  He waved 100p in my face, so I figure I can pop
in and pop out if I'm lucky.

Lose connection with the server.  I'm now LD in Skyfire.

Reconnect.  I'm in Skyfire.  Yea, rah. Get me the heck out of here!  Throw
Ring of GD .....

Lose connection with the server.  Machine hangs up.  Reboot.

Reconnect.  I'm in GD.  Take someone to WC, from there to DL, from there to
Feerrot, from there back to WC.  Each time I arrive, but it seems to take a
loooong time.  One of my customers comment that this is the first time he's
successfully zoned today.

I should've taken that to heart.  But no ......

From WC to EJ ... you guessed it.  Lose connection with the server.

Now I can't reconnect.  1001.
