In the areas I've been in (on my server anyway), people tend to
announce what they are forming a group for.  The /ooc and /shouts are
typically something like 'Looking for more for Giants group!' or 'Need
one more healer for EL Boat Ride!', etc.  It makes it easy to pick
which groups you want to join, or if you are starting one, to make sure
you get people with a common goal.  It is a lot easier to keep
everybody on track that way.

Last night I decided to start a group to get Nixam (for DFC access).
One /ooc later, I had four other people in my group, and a guild member
was running from a tradeskill instance in Qeynos to help ((well, two
others and two more waiting until the guildie got there and we got him
up to that point - about a four min wait).  It took next to no time at
all, and the group had a single purpose.
