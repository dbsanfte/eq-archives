Ahhh, so the difference for you is the context of when it is OK to use
abbreviations? No seems to ever express that point.

I agree that it is rude to say "sow plz", but sometimes (depending on
company of coarse), it nice manners to say "can i have a sow please?".

Even in my normal group we at first  talked in longer words and sentences,
and now accept "ty", and "plz", and "yw" as acceptable answers. I tend to
reserve these for those I am "comfortable" with in EQ as use them sparingly
for those I do not.

I similary ignore someone who shows vagrant disregaurd for spelling, but
sometimes it's a more conveinent especially when you have a big though and
want to quickly express it.

For me the bottom line, is to be courteous just like in RL, and use the
dreaded EQ-speak when i need to.



Good Hunting!
