Like you I only had those two files - deleted them, patch downloaded sky.s3d
again.  Checked eqclient.ini - already set to DX7 anyway.  Still can't get
in.  Change eqclient to DX8, still can't get in.  Back again to DX7, still
not, delete sky.s3d again, still not.  Restart computer and repeat processes
again. Still can't.  Thorough file check.  Still can't.  Delete the DX7 and
DX8 EQ DLL files and redownload (DX7 only), still can't.  Ran patch then
deleted sky.s3d before playing.  Still can't.  Delete eqmain.dll, redownload
patch, still can't.  I am really starting to get annoyed.  any suggestions?
