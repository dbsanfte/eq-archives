Have you seen the list of GMs? The number of them there? Most servers
only have one full-time GM. I don't recall the exact number, but
there's somewhere around 15 on the Legends server. These aren't
guides, these are GMs who each are getting a paycheck from Verant in
addition to the paychecks VI is cutting the GMs on the other servers.
IMO, $40 is probably kinda low-end considering the payroll just for
that server. As I recall, when the idea was originally brought up,
they were talking $60 per month.

That said, $40 per month is too much for me to pay to play a game. But
there are those who will, and I wish 'em well. If it's too much for
you, simply don't pay it.
