In EQ1, you didn't help people by attacking their mob unless you had
permission, because of the risk of kill stealing, but there were other ways
to help, such as healing someone you see who is in trouble, or popping a
damage shield on them, or buffing them with AC or HP or KEI, or SOW so they
can run away if they want.  I don't recall people asking for permission to
give that kind of help, or anyone objecting when they receive it.

The thing about EQ2 is you can't do those other kinds of help without being
grouped with them.  No running down the road on a long journey and stopping
to SOW my fellow travellers.  No seeing someone whose fight looks like it
will be close, and saving the day for them by pausing and popping off a big
heal on them.
