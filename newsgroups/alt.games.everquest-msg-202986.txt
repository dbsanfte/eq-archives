Well, I think with KEI, the overnuking, over-DOTing casters were able
to get away with their poor playing styles; taking KEI out of the game
will mean these players will now be starting to suffer the
consequences for their poor mana management.  The smarter players
would probably begin to adapt and learn how to manage their mana
better and the crummy players will either quit or start playing a
melee type.  

Speaking of melees, the melees who were used to having high level
buffs or KEI'd group members who could heal nonstop will also have to
learn to adjust their playing styles.  I don't know how many melees
are out there who got used to always having high-level HP buffs or
having KEI'd group members and thus regularly pulled numerous red MOBs
to their group; with the current change, they now risk getting the
whole group killed (or if they're not killed, they'll have a lot of
downtime afterwards).  And again, the smarter players will probably
adapt and learn to pull more carefully.

So in a way, one could say removing KEI/high level buffs is actually a
better way to weed out the bad players as their bad playing habits
will now become much more glaringly obvious.
