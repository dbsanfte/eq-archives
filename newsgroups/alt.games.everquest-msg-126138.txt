ToFS is NOT a good place to _start_ fighting in dungeons.

It's great when you've had a group that can work together
and know a bit more about fighting inside, but going on
your first raid ever in ToFS is an invitation to a wipeout.

Level appropriate, of course.  But even a single group of 45's
could be overwhelmed on some of the higher floors if they're
not experinced in indoor fighting.

I'd go with Dalnir or Splitpaw.  If there are more 25s than
35s I'd throw RunnyEye into the mix, too, but it CAN lead
to trouble if the spawn table has a bunch of casters up.

Good luck!
