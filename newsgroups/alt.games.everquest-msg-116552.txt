Can you cite some specific examples? Otherwise I'd have to respectfully
disagree based on my experience. And after 55 levels as a Troll, I get a
lot of faction issues everywhere I go.  I believe (Note: not stated as
fact) that the *worst* faction you can have with any true merchant (i.e.
an NPC who sells things) is dubious, and dubious creatures will never
attack you unprovoked, either by you, or through assisting a buddy who
is already engaging you.

Example: The gyspy camps both in NK and in Lavastorm. The merchants
wouldnt' do business with my troll, but woulnd't attack either. But they
always stick ONE freaking quest mob in there who's not a merchant, and
can be KOS to you. So of course, if you get in their aggro range, they
light off on you and then all the merchants come screaming in about how
you've ruined their homelands, etc. etc.

Of course, now that I think of it, I'm not sure even that rule applies
to all of them. As another poster pointed out, you can kill one of the
meadowgreen brothers in SK (the non-merchant one) all day long and his
merchant brother won't come help.

But I still believe I've never heard of a single instance of a merchant
NPC just coming up and ganking somebody that wasn't on another NPC's
hate list.
