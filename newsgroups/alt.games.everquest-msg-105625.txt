fyi - I did move the whip to my primary hand just ot test it out and beat on
some green orcs for fun... it did finally proc (lvl 27) not sure exactly
what lvl it starts at, perhaps 25 still, but in my off hand it wasn't
striking often enough for me to notice it.

Suffice to say, even lashing the orc to death with it, the thing only proc'd
once in about 20 hits.
