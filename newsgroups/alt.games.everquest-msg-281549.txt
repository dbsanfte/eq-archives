I have just finished loading the DoN and DoD expansions and was hoping
someone could give me some tips on them. I looked at the sony station site
but they weren't much help.

What are monster missions? How do you start them? Can you solo them or do
you need a group? Where do you go to start one? What are shrouds for? Can
you solo a DoD adventure? Where do you start them? Any advice on what to do
or what not to do with them?


Thank you
