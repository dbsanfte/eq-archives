Wolf form tends to make you more KOS in Kunark and Velious than your
normal form, and even some of the old world was changed to take this
advantage away from druids and rangers.

You'll either need to sneak behind Trooper Mozo to turn them in and
hope he doesn't turn around (if you're of a class/race combo that has
the skill), or kill enough goblins, sarnaks and iksar bandit types to
get non-kos to the troopers (LegionOfCabalis).

Be sure to stand as far behind the trooper as you can get, as Crusader
Bodi (SK faction) and Crusader Quarg (shaman faction) patrol through
the city entrance regularly.

While possible to turn in while invisible, you become visible the
instant the trade window opens and get agro if KOS.  If not KOS but
still have too low of faction to turn in bone chips, you can get
another person to invis you after the trade window is open and click
trade.

I believe the estimation for an agnostic character is 2000 bone chips
before you can safely walk around most of cabalis (the necros will
still do unkind things to you).  Around 5000 for any religion other
than Cazic Thule.
