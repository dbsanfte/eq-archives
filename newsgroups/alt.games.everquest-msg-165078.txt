Even leaving aside the fact that you are a druid, and so can self-sow
(yes, yes, we know it doesn't work in dungeons) you are already level
fifty one. Turn off regular xp and turn on AA xp until you have run
three. My jboots have been rotting in the bank since I got Run 3.

Oh, wait. You can't. You already deleted your character in a pissy fit
and quit. Hold on... I've got a quarter. I'll call the Waaaaaaambulance
for you.
