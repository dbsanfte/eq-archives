Bah i may be a damn statistician but the underlying assertion is factual. In
the end only individuals pay taxes whether they be owners, employees, or
customers of a buisness. And taxing corporations in the us raises the prices
of goods giving foreign corporations a price advantage. It also causes our
corporations to move outside the us losing us jobs so that they can regain
an even playing field and can once again compete on price. Other weird stuff
also happens and it is all so unnecessary. If you just tax the people
directly you avoid all the sneaking around the rules that causes all the
problems. Keep it simple stupid works well for taxes and many other things
:)
