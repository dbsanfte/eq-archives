Only Patrons can get Writs, Patrons are set by guild leader and officers. 
They will be very carefull about who they set up as a patron also, as if the 
patron quicks all the exp they're earned for the guild goes poof.
What a writ is, is a kill quest of some sort usually. Go out and slay 11 
gnoll mystics. The experience from finishing the quest itself goes to the 
guild, to increase the guild level. The higher the level of the guild the 
more percs the city offers (example horses at a cheaper rate),an the patron 
gets some status points. If the patron gets the writ prior to grouping then 
only the patron will get status points, if he gets the writ after the group 
is formed everyone in the group thats a member of the guild will recieve 
status points. There are City Merchants in various parts of the town these 
merchants are where you purchase things with status points. The higher the 
guild level the more items you will see listed. Also there are some 
exclusive merchants you can't even get too until the guild has achieved a 
certain level. Some of the silly things that status does for you, example if 
you recieve status rank of Seargant of Arms, the guards will all salute you 
when you walk through town. There are 4 differant factions in town and all 4 
give differant writs/quests. Now the patrons have to keep active at doing 
the quests or the guilds level will start to deteriorate, and there are 
things like you buy the fancy painting with status points an some cash too, 
and it won't drop quite as fast. Thats the rough basics of it, it's a lot 
more detailed than that, and status also effects how you are percieved in 
the lands outside of your home town.
