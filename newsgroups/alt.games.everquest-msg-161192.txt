I understand, my question was, are you using cultural purely for skilling
up, or are you making it for profit?  Are you making a zillion bracers, or
are you making armor to order?  If you are making a lot of it for skillups,
well, then every last plat counts I would expect.  If you are making a piece
to order once in a while, 100pp for a leather padding is nothing.
