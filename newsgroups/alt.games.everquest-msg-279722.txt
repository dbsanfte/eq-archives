The scary thing is, particularly with the manner Sony makes any such
statements, one of our counts, or hell even both of them, may be closer to
reality than any "spun" numbers released by Sony in response to a particular
issue.

Technically, you're right.  But Sony can also see that a lot of accounts sit
inactive between expansions and come highly active at the release of every
big chunk of raid content.  That does of course include some non-raiders,
but such a predictable inactivity is probably mostly attributable to
raiders.

You can have influence on that.  I like the line "That was a fun run, but
please, anything but Creator this time".  =)

Been there, done that, called it the PoJ trials.   =)
