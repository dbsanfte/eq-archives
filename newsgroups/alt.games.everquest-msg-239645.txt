: Hi All
:
: I almost felt I should have typed "rouge" because nearly everyone spells
it wrong, but
: enough of that, heh.
:
: I posted a short while ago about hotbuttons to help a rogue's skills max,
and have come up
: with two good ones. The hotbutton layouts below assume that Hide is
ability 1, Sneak is
: ability 2, Pickpocket is ability 3, Backstab is ability 4, Sense Traps is
ability 5.

May I suggest:
/doability 4
/attack off
/doability 2
/doability 1
/attack on

That's will backstab and then immediatly evade when you PO the mob.  You can
then do one for PP, also. I would not recommend PP in a pick up group,
though.  People will figure it out fast enough when no gems and little plat
is dropping.


Tie Sense traps and Disarm to movement keys

:
:
: HOTBUTTON 1 (For Evading in melee and Sneak/Hide combo)
:
: /attack off
: /doability 5
: /doability 1
: /doability 2
:
:
: HOTBUTTON 2 (For attacking when behind the mob)
:
: /doability 5
: /doability 3
: /doability 4
: /attack
:
: Always press Button 1 prior to combat, get behind the mob that is under
attack by the
: group's tank, then press Button 2.  When the Backstab and Pickpocket
skills are available
: to use again (about 10 to 12 seconds to cover all the skills used above)
simply press
: Button 1 followed immediately by Button 2.  Rinse and repeat every 10 to
12 seconds.  If
: the mob turns to beat on you, press Button 1 to stop attacking and Evade.
Hopefully the
: mob will turn away from you, back to the tank.  Hit button 2 and rinse and
repeat
: again....
:
: To skill-up when not in combat, press button 1 as many times as you can
while sitting or
: otherwise idle.
:
: At level 23 I now have Sneak and Hide at 120 each, Sense Traps is 102,
Backstab is 105
: (and climbing) and Pickpocket is 85 (and climbing).   I only started with
these hotbuttons
: at level 21.5  :)  Using Hide and Sneak together I can now walk
"invisibly" for as long as
: I like, and the undead mobs in Befallen/goblins in HHK don't seem to react
to me even when
: I bump into them  :D  Try and bum a SoW spell though, as Hide/Sneaking
without one is a
: bit slow and frustrating.  I even get to backstab for 80 while meleeing
goblins in HHK,
: sometimes, which is very popular with the group  ;)
:
: Oh, another thing, by practicing on the locked door in Befallen, last
night, my Pick Lock
: skill went up from 12 to 60+in less than 15 minutes, but that particular
door stopped
: giving me skill-ups.  (There are doors lower down that I will spend some
time on)  I only
: mention this because I was asked by another Rogue (higher level than me,
too!) how on
: earth he was going to get Pick Lock up by practicing it  - apparently he'd
not heard of
: the doors in there  :)
:
: Enjoy!
