You lack something that is most important in an exploring, exp-grindable
group...melee damage.

Go with the monk.  You've got everything the bard could add
already with the enchanter/cleric/druid part, and the warrior is
going to need help taking down the tough stuff with the only sure-
fire unresistable damage-dealing method, melee output.  Take
the monk.
