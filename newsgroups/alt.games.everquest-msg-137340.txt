Aye, I understand that, and I wouldn't even mind being kicked off once every
hour or so.. but not as much as I do.. I live in the middle of a forest, so
dial up is the only thing available for me.  I have 2 accounts and 3 phone
lines.  My laptop almost never disconnects, but my desktop does.  The dial
up stays connected though, it's just eq that gives me the 'you have been
disconnected' screen.  Everything else stays on, just eq disconnects.
(usually I turn everything off, though).
