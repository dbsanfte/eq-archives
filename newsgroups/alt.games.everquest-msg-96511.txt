From my experience, when you boost the gamma in-game, that's the only place
the boost is applied.  When you take a screenshot, you're taking it from the
'pre-boost' point-of-view.  Hence, you've got to apply a gamma boost in
another graphics program (Irfanview (www.irfanview.com) works wonderfully
for simple stuff like this).
