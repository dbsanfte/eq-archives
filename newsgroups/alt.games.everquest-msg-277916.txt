It's been about 5 or 6 years I've been playing EverQuest.  My life has just
moved on and I don't have time to play.  Sure I can go in and kill a few
things but I don't have time for grouping or questing.  For the past year or
so I just log in and download updates, maybe kill a couple of things then
log out.  I have all 9 expansions.  And several characters in their 50s.
Lol Jboots on 8 characters on 2 servers.  And a ring of ancients on 3 or 4
more.  A Quillamain Pegasus cloak on a clerk lol.  Several other rare items
for higher level quest.

All those years spent doing things for fun with friends now I and my friends
have moved on with our lives and there's no time for EverQuest.  What do I
do with this account?  Just deleting it and erasing years seems almost like
killing my guys, lol.  I've wanted to quit several times but that seems such
a waste to destroy the characters with all their experience and items.  Is
selling your account still illegal with Sony?  I don't feel like getting
reimbursed for the 9 expansions is doing anything wrong, and if I make a
little extra I look at it as a good business deal.  I'm probably going to
get flamed for evening hinting such a idea by this newsgroup but I'm curious
what everybody does with their accounts and characters when they decide to
move on?

Be nice please, do I just delete everything?
Or is it asking too much to be reimbursed for the expansions and disks I
give someone that wants to resume where I left of?
