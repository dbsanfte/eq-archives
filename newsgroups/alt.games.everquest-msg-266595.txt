Thanks for the comparison. It's good to hear that EQ2 relaxes a bit by 
level 10 or so. Ironically, that was my biggest complaint about WoW - that 
it really felt like I was being led along a fairly linear progression. 
Sure, there were a wealth of quests to complete at each stage, but they 
were usually more of the same and it was clear that once I hit a certain 
level, I was gonna be shipped off to the next area to do the same type of 
things again. I've not heard whether this changes at higher levels in WoW 
or not.
