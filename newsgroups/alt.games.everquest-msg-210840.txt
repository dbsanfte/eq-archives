In a focus IV item?  I doubt most people have a large number of focus IV 
items.  At the lower levels, focus items are not too difficult to obtain, 
but the ones that affect spells 61 to 65 are a bit tougher to come by.  I 
see people asking for focus items from mages all the time, and at most 
levels of play for that matter.
