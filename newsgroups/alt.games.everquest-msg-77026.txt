Bow range PLUS arrow range sets the distance.  As a rule, no, bows don't
do important amounts of damage, as you tend to only hit things once or twice
before they close to "too close"  It is possible to "bow kite" mobs, but that
generally means using arrows that cost more than the loot the mob will drop,
and as a warrior, you'd need help to get the mob snared and yourself SOW'd,
which is the combination that makes this practical (well, its also practical
to shoot a rooted mob up)

What most people want bows for is pulling or tagging.  Being able to hit
a selected mob at a distance, without having to wander thru other mobs
that will aggro on you but not add in if that target mob is coming along is
very important... and at higher levels, being able to select a mob that
the monk puller has set up for you from the safety of the raid is even more
important.

With a good long range bow and long range arrow, you can literally hit
mobs further away than you can see with your clip plane out to max.  For
some fun (its cost prohibitive) get a spyglass, and a set like this, and it is
possible to hit mobs so far away that they don't aggro on you, and whittle
them down to near death before approaching so they finally come running
towards you.  I have a ranger friend who can kill mobs off before they
reach him in this way, his main concern is not accidentally killing them, since
they are also too far off for their HP to update.  Trick is to station a spotter,
non-kos or camo'd up, near the mob to tell him how the mob is doing!
