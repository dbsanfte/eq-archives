Caster's Realm: Why I Play Everquest 2005

Many players focus their attention on the details of Everquest. They
focus on experience gain, equipment rewards, damage-per-second
statistics, and class balance. Every day angry players write about tiny
details that make little difference in this vast game. They don't sound
like players having fun, they sound like politicians. Perhaps they
forget exactly why they play.

Three years ago in my article, 'Why I Play Everquest', I wrote out the
rules I tried to keep in mind as I played Everquest. I have since
revised these rules down to the following:

Rule 1: Have Fun Every Day You Play

If you find yourself doing something you don't enjoy, leave. If you
find yourself on boring hunts solely hunting for experience gain, try
something else. If you hate raiding but raid every day because you
think it's the only way to get ahead, stop.

Ask yourself what is truely important. What will you walk away with
when you leave this game? Will you look back fondly at your time
hunting in Norrath or will you only remember how boring it was to
experience grind?

Do what you enjoy most.

Rule 2: People are Everquest's Strength

The other players can be your sharpest weapon, your most powerful
armor, and your greatest treasure. The friends you meet on your
adventures will give you a far greater benefit than any in-game reward.
The people you meet and the adventures you share are the true rewards
of Everquest. Your friends list is your greatest possession.

Rule 3: The Grass Is Not Greener

Everyone looks up to another player or another group and imagines how
wonderful it would be to be them. When you actually talk to them, you
find out that they feel the same way about someone else. Sometimes they
are happy with their station in life but other times they grow bored or
restless. They find another item, another level, or another goal they
want as badly as you want what they have. Often they are having no more
fun than you can.

Be happy where you are. There is nothing wrong with wishing to progress
but don't imagine that Norrath becomes a better place at 70 than it is
at 40.

Rule 4: Don't Rush to Progress, Enjoy Yourself

Norrath is a huge world filled with interesting sights to see and
powerful beasts to slay. Don't spend it all grinding in Paludal Caverns
because you want to get to the end-game (remember, there IS no end-game
in an evolving world).

Hunt to have fun. Don't hunt for experience or equipment, hunt because
you enjoy it. Explore the depths of Kaesora. Listen to the waves lap
against the beaches of North Ro. Smell the clean air of the Greater
Faydark. Dance with the Othmars!

This game is not a race. There is no golden chalice at the end of the
game. You cannot save Princess Toadstool. There is no powerful weapon
worth stealing the experience of seeing the rest of Norrath. You don't
have to be earning experience or winning loot to play Everquest. You
can play Everquest while sitting on a hill watching the sun set.

I do not follow these rules to the letter. All of us look at people
more powerful than ourselves and wonder what it would be like. We see
the shine of epic weapons (whether 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0) and fill with
envy. However it is always important to keep our true goals in mind.

Now a little bit about in-game progression.

Over the past three years two important truths became clear to me:

- Gear, Level, and AA Progression Is Important
- Gear, Level, and AA Progression Is Pointless

There used to be a theory that the center of the galaxy that all
planets and solar systems orbit around was actually an empty black
hole. Likewise, the core of our desire to hunt and play Everquest - the
tangable rewards of levels and equipment - are really empty goals.

People seek progression. People seek the easiest path to the best
tangable reward. We saw it when people went from level 65 to 70 in two
days by hunting in the Plane of Fire. We saw it when people did Gimblax
and Creator missions more than any other mission in Dragons of Norrath.
People seek the easiest tangable reward for their effort. They want
fast experience and good equipment.

Progression is critical to Everquest. Without tangable progression,
people will quit. Watching our characters grow in strengh and power
keeps us coming back. We enjoy watching our characters improve. We like
seeing numbers go up as we equip new items. We like destroying foes as
easily as they once used to destroy us.

Ironically, some players want to reach some end state. They call it the
'end game'. They want gear they never want to replace. They want to hit
the highest level and never level again. If they actually receive what
they want, they would lose the drive to play. Who wants to hunt if you
gain nothing for the effort? This is why we see increased level caps,
more alternate skills, new higher level zones, and better equipment
upgrades.

But progression is also pointless. Your non-EQ friends don't care if
you're level 40 or level 70. Your Blazing Sword of Rallos Zek will not
cut you a greater path through the lines at the grocery store. Five
hundred AA points won't make gas prices drop below $2.50 a gallon.

Your gear and your level is not real. Your level and equipment will
disappear if you ever decide to stop playing Everquest. Your character
is just tiny bits of data inside some database on the west coast. Your
level and gear are not real.

The friends you meet and the adventures you share are the true reward
you earn. These friends are the reason I play Everquest.
