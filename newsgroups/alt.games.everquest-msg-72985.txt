I didn't miss a *damned* thing, so far as your post was concerned. However,
I dismissed it pretty much entirely (yeah, I know, you don't give a shit)
when I attempted to read it and confronted D00disms and -completely-
non-existent punctuation. I understand that this is merely a NG and, as
such, doesn't 'merit' that much thought on your part... but if we, the NG,
think 'globally' that you aren't very articulate here... then what, in god's
name, will your future employer think of you?? Or... do you care? Are you
wealthy? Do you have No concerns for whatever your future employers think of
you? Will they hire an illiterate person such as yourself to take care of
sensitive systems? Will they even want to associate with someone who can't
spell, much less *punctuate* simple sentences? (Btw, are you still in High
School? They should have
taught you that much, at least, by now). Obviously you don't care enough to
post in a format we all can read in THIS NG, despite your claims that
"However as I'm
far to nice" (sic)...

Perhaps not. Probably, you just don't give a shit. *I* really don't, either,
except that people like you aggravate me intensely, mostly because a large
part of the human race at least *attempts* to be understood, to be better
than what they are at that moment in time.

You, evidently, do not care. I feel sorry for you for that.

I take you into the KF area of my computer.
