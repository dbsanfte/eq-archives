Is there any particular use to having the spell Identify?

Also why would I want to illusion as dwarf or barbarian, when I have
illusions of other races (h-elf, human, gnome).  I can see having dark elf,
but then why buy ogre or troll? Am I on track here?

Also I am wondering about the cost effectiveness of the SoL spells
Intellectual Advancement or Superiority.  Do they do that much?
