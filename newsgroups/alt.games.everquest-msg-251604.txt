I am sorry about my lack of knowledge of mages.. I only played one to
about level 11.  So im not fully aware of the various tricks you have
up your sleeve.  So I take it no snare in the ole sleeve?  Which would
be great for aggro kiting.

Lol, I did the same thing my first time to try this place out... bit
off more than I wanted to chew.

Must of been a repop, because the Only roaming shiknars I know of are
inside the lower cave.

ya, not hightly efficient, but hopefully you will find a sweet spot in
here... FYI there are teh Dregs that are over in the other part of
zone... they are all Lt blue to me at 65, but may have a better color
for you.

If you do, let me know how it goes.

Well Id say keep em, because they are for shissar bane weapons. Not
sure how big that is on your server, but they sell for 40 pp a pop on
Quellious.

I can see the various issues you do have with the run, but a quick
OOC, WTB xloc to Twilight Sea, will put you right at the zone in if
there are ny porters available.
