Dave,
    First of all, read my follow up to your previous post. Next if they
only glower dubiously at you, they won't attack, so you should be ok.
Just to be safe put everything you have, I mean everything in the bank
and then go through and get on the boat. Before even heading to the
bank in Qeynos, get a bind. You should be fine after that. Good luck,
don't worry things will work out.

Troy
