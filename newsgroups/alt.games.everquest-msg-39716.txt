I have to admit I'm a bit confused over what the effects of SoW have to do
with the discussion.  Just because SoW does not affect your agility, and
does affect your movement speed does not, in of itself, mean that agility
does not affect movement speed.  I have seen the evidence presented, and it
certainly appears to be the case that agility does not affect movement
speed, but presenting SoW as proof of this seems a bit absurd.  All that
shows is that movement speed can be affected independantly of agility.
