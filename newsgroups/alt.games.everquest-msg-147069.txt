Ohhh, I misread you.  Well, role-playing doesn't happen much at all,
unfortunately...but on the plus side, not everyone is into hardcore
statistics.  I've survived 3.5 years (sad, eh?) blissfully ignorant of
exactly why uberweapon_01 is better than uberweapon_44.

I mean, ok...I know that my level 60 enchanter's INT caps out at 255.  I
don't know how to figure out how much mana I have beyond casting X number of
times and do the math.  I mean, KEI at 900 mana a shot...just 4 times but I
still have a little mana left over.  Sooo, 4x900=3600 mana + some left over.
I'm guestimating I have a mana pool of about 4000-4100 but I don't really
care.

And I know that after I have my 255 max INT, I need to work on being a
hardier little gnome, and that means I need to add AC and HP...and that not
only does AC & HP items give me those two things, but AGI and STA as well.
But how much AC I get per AC point, or per AGI point...don't know...don't
care.

And, of course, if I'm swimming in lava I'm going to want fire protection.

And my gnomes still really really dislike high elves in general (only a very
few exceptions) and "tolerates" most other races.
