Well, max str definately, i think to 150 or 155. The reason for
maxxing str on an ogre warrior? BECAUSE YOU CAN. Yeah, str is mainly
carrying capacity and won't add a hUGE damage bonus when high (people
quote figures of like 10 percent or less) but to NOT max it as an ogre
warrior seems a waste. Basically figure it this way, you'll always
feel like you have plenty of str if it is maxxed at 150 or so.. even
when you are level 55 and maybe most of the stuff you are wearing is
not plus str. 

Another bonus of the high str is that since ogres are basically stupid
and not wise, you still have a chance to smith due to the str if you
want to.

Dexterity is ONLY the rate at which you add points to melee skills, or
the rate for learning such skills. Its also how often you can proc,
sort of, but proc weapons kind of got out of fashion and people go
more for damage delay ratios now and you see YAKS and such getting
dumped all the time because they are really a poor weapon for the
money (very very poor)

If your dex is 75 or above you are more than fine.

Agil MUST be at least 75. Beyond that it does not matter a lot, if you
make it at least 80 you are perfectly fine.

Stamina is about your last concern but you should already start out
very high. Of course like str the high sta you have is a bonus to
being an ogre. What I did on my ogre warrior I think was max str, get
dex and agil to both at least 80 then dump the rest into sta. Any
extra I had (if I did ) I put into agil then just to be safe (charisma
would not be a totally bad idea either ;) )

http://eq.castersrealm.com/creationguides/Warrior.asp

Caster's realm suggests a more balanced approach with str at the base
140 and dex and agil raised to 85. The thing is, there is really not
much point to have those both at 85. 80 would be more than plenty and
I just can't resist having max str on an ogre, call me goofy.
