If your am Iksar you should be able to get Dreadscale BP, Boots, and
gaunts by now, the latter 2 just by looting dropped mobs in Overthere.
Money is a factor as each piece of DS requires 100+ pp in store bought
gems.  Very good armor that will last you many levels.  Try to keep all
your skills progressing along, there are many wep options open to the sk
later on.  I went 2hs and 1hs most of the way and now that i just
acquired a MoSS im swinging like heck trying to raise the skill (I
previously only took it to 100).  I good and inexpensive 2hs would be a
Tower Guards Blade. Good damage and prices have dropped alot.  On my
server a babs goes for 400pp and has a very good ratio, i use it now at
43. Hope this helps.
