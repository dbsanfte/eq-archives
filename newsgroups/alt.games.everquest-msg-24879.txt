Not off the top of my head.  Try www.allakhazam.com under Links and look for
the class-specific links.

Totally up to you...it doesn't make any difference if you know where the
spells are.

Preface:  When I give a page number it's what I type to get to it but it
actually means both "sides" of the book.  If I say page 10 it means I /book
10...and I mean pages 9 & 10.

Personally on ALL my casters I put "eye" spells (invis, camo, see invis,
sense dead, sense summoned, etc) on page 15.  I USUALLY (I need to change my
enchanter) put my class-specific/specialty spells on page 30.  My druid has
all his self-ports on 30, group ports on 35.  All my casters except wizard
have their yellow buffs on page 6 (wiz has on 8...no room on 6 and I'm not
going to change everyone to accommodate him).

Most used spells on page 1-2, and 3-4.  Misc spells (levitate, bind
affinity, water breathing...stuff I don't use every single day) on 10.

My enchanter also puts non-yellow buffs on page 6, such as haste spells.
Though I use it pretty often I just don't have room on pages 1-4.  Hell, I
had to relegate root to page 10!  Yeah, I feel your pain. :)
