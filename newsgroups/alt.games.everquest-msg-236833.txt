}Doesn't ANYONE read the messages when they log in?

Well... I try to.  But lately, the messages have suffered from some weird 
bug.  They keep getting displayed when I first leave a server, rather than 
on the way in.  And since I usually leave a server by crashing to desktop 
lately... I read them in the newsgroup. :)

Luckily, the "please give us money to activate GoD!" plea is also 
postponed (about 70% of the time) to when I'm leaving the server.

Is anyone else having these sorts of troubles?  Noticed anything that 
would affect when these messages are displayed?  It's been doing this 
since LDoN came out, I think.
