Hell YEAH! Wizzi's a lil tank with fully MAXED out weapon skills.  My
daughter logged her druid to PL me for a bit.  I ran outta man early on and
she DS'd me and I stood in harms way with auto attack on til the reds and
yellows dropped dead at my feet and I flexed my little gnomie muscles.  By
the time we were done my melee skills were better than my casting skills.
It was a blast.
