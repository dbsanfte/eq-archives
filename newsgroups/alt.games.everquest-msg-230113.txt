I've played many characters to mid-40's and never felt 20 to 21 took
longer than 1 to 10.  However, I didn't pay attention to how long the
leveling took.  I also don't twink and generally do all the newbie
armor quests on each new character.  That probably increases the time
it takes me to do 1 to 10.

I like/dislike places like PoK.  It's convenient but...perhaps too
convenient.  If it were up to me (everyone is probably very lucky
it's not :), I would have implemented a Diablo II-style travel
mechanism.
