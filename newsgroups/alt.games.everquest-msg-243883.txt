This reminds me of the time I came across a very twinked lvl 19 High Elf
Mage, still lvling in the upstairs of Kurn's.  I was lvl 14 Dark Elf Mage,
and I had just lvled to that, so I was commenting on how fast meditate went
up.  He didn't say anything, but we were both low on mana and medding.  I
was at 0 m when I started medding I was at full mana by the time he had 40m,
and I had more Int and mana gear.  Turns out he didn't spend into Meditate
cause he didn't know what it did.  And was saving all his points for
research.

His friend had twinked him out and this was his first char.  Doesn't common
sense dictate that meditate is a focusing of energies?  I don't know I just
shook my head and almost fell off my chair laughing.

And wouldn't the friend tell him to put at least one point in something when
it comes available.
