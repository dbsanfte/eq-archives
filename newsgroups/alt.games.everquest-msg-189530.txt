Hmm does the nerf affect Dire Charm?  Maybe so but these changes are
geared to stop the insanity that goes along with CoD, and to a lesser
extent the high level Mage/Nec/Dru charms.

It seems to me that since it took them so long to affect these changes
(and maybe they wont go live...) that it must have been all of the
people rocketing to 300+ AAs that finally got them to do something.
Enchanters farming the wing nameds in BoT was probably much more
complained about, but that just resulted in them nerfing the drops.

Anyway, the spells are so stupidly overpowered as it stands that they
are a great commentary on how little SOE knows about their playerbase
and what actually goes on in the high level game.  I cant believe it
took them so long to address them.  Still, I think they ought to just be
replaced with other spells rather than gimped into near-uselessness,
especially for Mag/Nec/Dru.  Its not like its the players of these
classes fault that SOE is clueless when it comes to risk/reward.
