nothur thing about charming... like with any pet a good tactic is
memblur/nuke if you have mana... if your pet does moer than 50% damage he
gets half exp... you do more you get all exp... memblur erases the damage
list and the nuke gives enough damage normally to keep you above the 50%
line so you get more exp... takes a little practice but more exp is good heh
