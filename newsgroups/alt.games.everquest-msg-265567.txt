If it proves that that the majority of the people on the forums are 
hardcore 10 hour a day players in their early 20s who churn through 
content as fast they can in groups of 30...then you'll miss out on a 
lot, and you'll over prioritize the wrong things.

When you only survey a small subset of your playerbase, and you let the 
group self-select by congregation and association, and you survey that 
same group over and over again, then you are selecting a subculture 
within the game and are not looking at a representative slice of the 
player base.

Some problems will be common to all groups, and you'll catch those.
Many others you will only see from one perspective, or miss entirely.
