    I'm convinced that when endless class conversations start, someone
should start a chat channel called "Everlore" and start inviting people into
it.

    It's an old raid habit, from multiple group situations. It's an old raid
habit that should be gone now, with the new chat channels, but old habits
die hard. Personally I love the new channels - once I figured out how to
make the first two channels show up as yellow and magenta (bright, distinct
colours), things became a lot easier to sort out.

    Bet they were camping Ragefire, as much as he can be camped. Have you
noticed much change in the traffic in the zone with Ragefire campers, or is
it back to normal? We're up to three guild clerics without epic, and soon
we're gonna have to bite the bullet.
