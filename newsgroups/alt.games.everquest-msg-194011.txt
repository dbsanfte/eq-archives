This is a commonly misunderstood subject. There are only 2 special lines of 
Bard songs that stack with spell haste, all other Bard hastes songs are 
considered spells for the purpose of haste stacking.

The only Bard songs that can stack are the Warsong/Battlecry line of songs 
and these allow you to go over the haste cap; and the Ervaj line of haste 
songs which do not allow you to go over the cap, but do stack with the 
spell/song variety of hastes and provide very little extra haste so are 
rarely used.
