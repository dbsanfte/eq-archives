heh heh

wow lokari took you about one hour im shocked

well as usuall, depend on you for in depth analysis of the problem

no, sticking to the old zones is not a solution

turning off all the things that people spend 30 dollars for is not a
solution

my computer is fast enough, trust me. Even without buying one of the
flagrantly advertised Falcon Northwest machines so blatantly plugged all
over the Luclin pile of goo. the expansion is just not "well made" period

other games have better looks and graphics than EQ and they work, period.
Luclin does not

look at todays patch message that tells you enough.

selling people a product that doenst function properly, aka Anarchy Online
in month one or Diablo 2 week one, is not acceptable.

anyone else beside Grandmaster of the Klan Lokari actually have any
complaints in this newsgroup?

I know you are there i see plenty of threads
