Hmm, I hope not. I did a task for the first time and had my request time
set to over 11 days. A /petition was marked "Pending Closed", based on
this being "A known issue". And they can't/won't even reset my timer
manually so I can continue. Oh well, maybe it will be in the next patch.
Oh wait, that's today! And it's not in the patch notes.
