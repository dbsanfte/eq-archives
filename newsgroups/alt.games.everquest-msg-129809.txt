You are joking, these people said some things which the Israeli

Or there might be if impartial, rather than racist, standards were 
applied. Rather than these stupid claims that all Palestinian civilian
casualties are "collateral damage" and all Israeli civilian casualties 
are "targeting civs". Undoubtedly some of the Israeli casualties are
in reality "collateral damage", indeed Israel appears to use creative
definitions of "civilian" when talking about Israeli casualties. Such
that "militiamen" and even regular soldiers mutate into "civilians".
