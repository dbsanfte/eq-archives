Completely irrelevent to the subject at hand.  Can you deny that Cox does
not carry every news group?

Looks like your research failed you there.  Maybe your use of google isn't
all that skilled.

The point isn't what I think you're entitled to, it's what you think you're
entitled to.  As for an answer to that, read the first sentence of the lines
you just responded to.  If you still can't figure it out, talk to a reading
teacher to help your comprehension.

Ah, NIMBY.  So you fancy yourself a conservative?  Shame, you don't have
what it takes.  You understand all the trappings of the right-wing movement,
but you utterly fail to understand the underlying concepts.  I am seeking a
market solution to what irritates me.  And since you use the term "NIMBY"
(Not In My Back Yard for those who don't know), let's see how well that
stacks up.  NIMBY is a term used for those who don't want neccessary
industies near them (ie.. power plants or oil wells).  They want the
benefits, but not the drawbacks.  OTOH, I want neither the "benefits" (none)
or the drawbacks of alt.flame.niggers in my back yard.  I am not asking for
something for nothing, as the NIMBY types are.
