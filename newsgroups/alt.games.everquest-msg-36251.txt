Hehe, never thougth i would say this, but i agreen with Dark Tyger here.


As far as i can see from this guys letter there are the followign problems:
He didnt even check up on this possible "bug" that have been bothering him for
over a month.

He didnt ask other players about it, or contacted VI, since he would then know it
is not a bug.

He insult VI   "theyre fat programmers who are lazy so what are we gonna do?"

He try to get people to spam bug report at VI and thereby wasting valuable GM and
developer time on having them to look at a lot of this shit instead of doign
customer service and developing the game (dont think i know anyone who have not
complained about GMs not responding or being slow, how do you thing stuff like
this would affect them)


Normally i dont agree to people just insulting each other, but this time i
actually condone it, for the first time since i have been using this NG (not
counting the spammers).
