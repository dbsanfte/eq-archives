No, but conversation directed to that person would be stupid. Replying
to a post on Usenet made by someone who has you killfiled as though
you were talking TO THEM specificly makes you look like an idiot, just
like talking as if you're addressing a person in a conference call who
hung up makes you look stupid. You can still talk ABOUT them without
looking foolish, though.

You can respond to posts someone who has you KFed made without looking
foolish. Do it without including "you"s and such to that person. Talk
ABOUT the post, not TO the person who made it.

Get it? Or do I need to use smaller words?
