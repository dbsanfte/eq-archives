The record for the longest Monopoly game is 70 days. 

What do you think the record would be for playing EQ
non-stop without sleep would be.
With the Monopoly they of course stopped the game and then continued 
the next day, but it would have to be till  the person fell asleep or
just couldn't take it anymore with EQ. Being that you could in fact
eat, drink, crap and piss at your desk or a smart guy would just move
his desk in front of the toilet and play away.
You would be one smelly bastard once you did pass out or start
hallucinating and start screaming that orcs were chasing you.

I'm pretty sure someone here had a link to an article once that some
guy in college had played for 3 days nonstop with out eating much and
he started to freak out.
