I haven't bought another game in 3 years.

I've upgraded the computer twice (not for EQ), bought
many new peripherals, and upgraded monitors, even,
but not bought a single new game.

My work is done on my computer, so when I have time
to PLAY on my computer, I'd usually just rather play EQ.
It's like a security blanket or something...
