FWIW, I never said any class was 'useless' on raids.  

In the debat, I might have mistated what I mean.  My main point is
that druids are a very versitile class, probably the most versitile
class in the game.  For that versitility we give up any real nitch to
fill, particularly in the end game.  I'm not saying they aren't
useful, just that they aren't necessary, for lack of a better word.
