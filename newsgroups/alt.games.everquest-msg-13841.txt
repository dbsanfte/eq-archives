This is very true.  Nobody, for example, knows my password, and nobody
ever will (this includes my wife).  Another important tip is to make
sure you really have an unguessable password.  If I know a person, I
can usually figure out their passwords within 10 guesses, cause most
people use birthdates, pet names, spouse and children's names or
something like that.  Passwords should really be random strings of
numbers, letters and symbols.

Even if people don't read it, at least they can say they tried.  Right
now, all they are doing is setting up the executioner without taking
any steps to prevent the crime, as it were.  I'd think they'd want to
be proactive about this sort of thing, if only for the improvement of
their image.
