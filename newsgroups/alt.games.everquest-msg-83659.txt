Agree, plus Necros get both Invis (Gather Shadows) and Invis to Undead,
makes travel easy.

Hehe, I like "eating" those level one rats just to top out my health after
dark pact wears off.

Dark Pact at level 8 is the first hp > mana line, CoB is just the first one
with skelly form.

And Mod Rods aren't that great considering they cost more to summon than
they give you, useful for a little mana battery to carry around for an
emergency (gate) though for you.

Coffins are NOT easy to lug around.  Well, until you get the Imp summon
corpse at 57 or from a Velious quest robe.  And then you have the
disadvantage of either A) having the coffin ON your corpse, or B) having to
bind at a bank so you can grab a coffin out of it.

CotH is useful, as are the dmg shield/fire resist buff.  However, for most
of your life as a mage, you don't have CotH.

Necro's get Screaming Terror (18 sec mez), so they can do that if necessary,
plus they can use the hp-to-mana --> lifetap --> twitch cycle to get mana to
other people who need it (EG CHealing cleric)  (twitch is just shorthand for
the necro mana "feed" spells where the necro spends 400 mana to give 150 to
somebody else;  spell effect says that "Necro_05 twitches" whenever he feeds
mana)
They also have ghetto heals (feed hp from necro to others, then lifetap it
back)

Also, make sure healers in your group know not to heal you until you ask for
it or by some prearranged signal (EG, If I go below 20% hp heal me)  Regen
is awesome though because for you it's almost like a clarity because you can
feed the regen into the hp to mana spell and not get hurt like normal but
still get the mana.

Assuming everything else equal, a solo necro has a higher kill rate than a
solo mage, mostly due to the hp to mana line with lifetaps.
Also, assuming both are very well played, a necro *can* be more of an asset
to a group than a mage.  (ghetto mez vs. summoned bandaids, oh yah, bandaids
rock!)  =P

Pet comparison:  for the most part, the necro and mage pets are equal,
unless you're talking the mage epic pet, which owns any necro pet  (although
the spectre pet just looks kickass)  However, for situational usage, the
mage has more versatility since they can use air pet to stun a caster, fire
pet for massive damage shield on a quick light hitter, earth pet for ghetto
root on a dangerous runner if you don't have a snarer (but for the love of
god kill Rocky if you've got a druid, ranger or wizard snaring) and water
pet for... umm. whatever the hell it is water pets do.

Don't get me wrong, I love mages, I'm just pointing out the abilities of the
class compared to necros.
