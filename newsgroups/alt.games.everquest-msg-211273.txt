Sorry to bother you with this question.  Looking at the Sony.com website, I
think I would like to start playing EverQuest.  Although the Online version
looks interesting, I think I want to start by buying EverQuest for my home
PC.  My question is, what is the first game I want to buy and what expansion
packs should I buy with it?

Thanks for any advise,

Russ
