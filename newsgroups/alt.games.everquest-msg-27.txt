While on the subject of people thinking you are a twink, bad, but not, i
have to go for the other way around, i created Ravyron, lvl 11 warrior on
Lanys twinked with 15 plat or so and some kits so i could master trade
skills, and that is my life goal, i make p.w. (patchwork, im not sure if
anyone else uses the abbreviation) and give it to the barbarians in
everfrost, who run around with horrible lag, get it, walk a few feet and get
killed.
    Most of the times i beg i refuse actually taking anything, unless it is
totally worthless, and probably being more a problem then anything (example:
somebody 5 lvls below me thinks they are supirior and lends me a few rat
ears (roflmao), and i run off and kill a giant snake to get the fangs (which
i can never sell now that i can kill them, they go for 2 gp or so, sell back
for 6.5 plat w/ vendors)

Ravyron
lvl 11 warrior
tailor: 23
blacksmith: ehhh....2
baking: 16 or so
Lanys'... uhh, Lanys' Tvyl (is that right?)
