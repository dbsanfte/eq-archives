Hrm, well, I don't know the precise amount that this has been changed,
mind you.  All we know for sure is that power and health regen faster
outside of combat mode, and that downtime is intended to be less than EQ-L
was.  Exactly how much less is not only up for speculation, but can be
tweaked throughout beta and even after the game goes live (though I sure
hope they don't do *that*).
