Lavastorm is great at that level. Remember to use your ward summoned
line there. Try pulling with it, if it says not summoned, choose a new
target.

Also, many have overlooked KFC. Go kill Aviaks at the Aviak treehouse
in S. Karana. Really nice site for a druid, and easy to get a group to
speed up the levelling.
