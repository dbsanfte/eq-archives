Hello all, I'm looking for suggestions on what would make a good 4
man group that is efficient both outdoors and in-dungeons, and
preferably all start around the same area, with -some- ability to
travel (sow, ports etc), and includes at least one rogue (because I
want to play one :) )


Some ideas I had:

Bard Druid Warrior Rogue?
Paladin Druid Enchanter Rogue?
Shaman Monk Wiz Rogue?

His singular obsession with with proofreading pettifoggery might be
amusing in one less perniciously predilected. His flaccid flailings
affirm an intellectual impuissance further debased by his
illegitimate pomposity. This captious miscreant needs a hobby
beyond his self-flaggelalant exposure of his unmannered
pbringing.  --Wade Hines, to D.Spenser Hines, on
