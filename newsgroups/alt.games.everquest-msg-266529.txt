Except the players are /petitioning and bitching about Sony rather than about
the person who sold the items.  Wrongly, perhaps, but it's far easier to claim
innocence and unfairness than to just accept the loss.

Read that aloud.  Pretend you're a SOE customer service rep talking to
the average customer who's pissed about having an item poof, won't admit to
paying real money for it, and just wants it fixed.  Heck, I'll even let you
assume it can be implemented bug-free.

Yup, they could spend a bunch of effort to get a lot of circumstantial
evidence and have a "good idea" of some accounts that are involved.  Not
enough evidence, mind you, to want to deal with the hassle of punishing any
but the most obvious ones...

If they DO punish all accounts that are involved, it's easy to get innocent
bystanders involved as shields.  Just make sure the account is used for
legitimate sales of item for plat in addition to the ebaying.  Now anyone
who's bought or sold anything on this trader has random items poof.

It's certainly an interesting question, and I'd love to see some data
on it.  However, it's interesting ONLY abstractly, or to players who are
very offended by the practice.  It's not very interesting to Sony - they
have a workable solution: lip service.  Make it against the rules and put
minimal effort into banning the most unarguable cases.

I argue that they are correct in their assessment.  There are very few players
who don't pay for EQ now, but would if they spent a bit more money and effort
on anti-ebay enforcement.
