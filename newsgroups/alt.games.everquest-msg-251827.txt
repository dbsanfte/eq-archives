My Enc 33 uses this this weapons:

Shaded Dagger		 22 del/11 dam
Staff of Prosperity	 40 del/25(32) dam,rec level 43
Both skills are maxxed.

Dagger does maximum damage 23 since some levels.
Staff does maximum damage 37 since level 31,although
the damage raises from 23 to 25 since level 31.

I would expect ,that if the dagger does double damage,
the staff would do the same,which means it should hit
for 50 now and not for only 37,not to speak of that the
maximum damage didnt raise since  2 levels.
This makes the staff inferior to the dagger,although
the ingame description would suggest the opposite.

Is it a bug or a feature?

And no,I dont need comments on meleeing enchanters. :)
