IT'S NOT YOUR GAME!

It's not your game, or your characters, or anything else of yours to
sell.

It's all Sony/VI's.

The only thing you own is the plastic cd.  All that's contained on it
is Sony's.  Same as your character.  It's contained on their servers.
It's their info.  They own it, and you have no right to sell it to
someone else.

Try going into Hertz or Enterprise and renting a car.  Then a week
later, you sell the car to someone else.

Who do you think is still responsible for that car?

Do you think they'd feel okay about you selling it to someone else?

I feel for your children.  They'd have better parentage in
Afghanistan.
