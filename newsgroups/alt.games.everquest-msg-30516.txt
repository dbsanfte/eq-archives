I have a LV17 Barbarian Warrior.  I am still wearing the banded I got back
at LV10.  I'm not exactly sure how much pp I've got in the bank, but I think
I'm nearing 300pp.  I had bought some better weapons, a "miniature axe" (axe
or battle axe, DEL 38 DMG 8, 1H Slash), and a "weighted axe" (DEL 150, DMG
45, magic 2H Slash).  I am wondering what kind of armor I should save up for
next, and about what LV should I get it at, and also how much pp I'll need.
I've heard of Fine Steel, Fine Plate, and Crafted.  What are the major
differences in AC, weight, and cost?  Would I want a set of one now and
replace it with a set of another later or just go for the better now?  My
STR is 133.
