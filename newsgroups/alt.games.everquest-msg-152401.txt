You may like the PS2 version... not everyone has a keyboard, and right now,
AFAIK, there's no support for them.

Got the keyboard in the mail today.. now where's the damn network card? When
I get it, I'll go try.

Easiest way to pimp EQ= here, you try this for a little. What kind of
character do you want? No, you drive. Iit's ok. I'll be right back, I need
to do this errand. Hi again! What level are you now? Did you notice I was
gone? heh heh heh... Sluuurp.
