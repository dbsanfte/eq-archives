On a lot of message boards, the topic with the most recent reply is moved to
the top of the list.

So, if a topic hasn't recieved a post in a while while other topics are
active, it be slowly moved down the list, behind the active ones until it
falls off the page to the next one.   Since people rarely bother to go to the
later pages and read the messages no longer active, if you want discussion on
the topic to continue, you make a small post on the thread that says nothing,
but "bumps the thread" back to the top of the list, since the topic received a
recent reply.
