My friend Wiki's daughter Sam also plays EQ. She's 3 and has her own 
account. She likes making a char and making them swim. Until they  drown 
often. She has leveled characters as far as level 4, but she has a habit 
of deleting her characters so she can make up something new. She also 
doesn't read and won't talk. She plays while sitting next to her dad, 
and tells him stories about what her character is doing and how they 
must rescue the princess and things like that. She also likes to be a 
druid on test because with test buff, she can run around as a puppy. 
"Daddy! Daddy! Me be doggie now!"

So your son isn't the only one out there.
