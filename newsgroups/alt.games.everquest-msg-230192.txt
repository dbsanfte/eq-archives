> I have a 40 Ranger and I was wondering how important it is to get all
melee
> skills up. For instance, do I really need 2HB?

Max the skills on the weapons u are currently using, that would probably be
1hs at your lvl.

I never worried with maxing my skills untill I actually had a use for them.
IE if u get a nice 1hb use it in the off hand untill u get your skill up to
the point where u actually can gain a DPS increase from using it in your
main ( skill in your primary weapon determins your atk )

My first decent 2 hander was the 2hb that drops from the spirits in UP, I
used it on raids untill my skill in 2hb got high enough to the point where I
could actually give decent dps with it. Today I still use a 2 hb (Gsotfw
from BoT towers) which is one of the best weapons IG for DPS if you have all
your AAs in 2 hand skill.
The best weapon atm for a ranger if u want to be a melee class in the
endgame is also a 2hb ( Vanazir, dreamers despair. Drops in PoTime )
There are also options for the use of dual wield in the endgame, but many
rangers prefer 2 handers since they give a lot less reposte and still is on
top when it comes to DPS. Im sure many of us wants to dual wield ( Drizzt
anyone ), but currently dual wield doesnt really cut it in the end game, as
far as I can see on many board discussions.

Maxing a skill when u get a higher lvl is very fast ( your melee stats are
higher, thus getting skill ups faster ), and if you dont want to be
embarased over your dps then go to a grp and ask then if they mind you
standing there to get skillups with whatever type of weapon you want to use.
If you can find a shaman so your str is maxed skillups will not take very
long, and the faster the weapon you train with, the faster you will get
skill ups
