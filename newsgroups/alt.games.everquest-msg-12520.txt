When PLing someone the MOST they can earn per kill is somewhere around a
half of a yellow bubble.  The level 1 can kill a orc legionnaire or sand
giant, and he'd get the same amount of xp.

So just take him ANYWHERE that the average critter is 3 or 4 levels above
them.

There is no "best."  Anything above 4 levels above them will be a mana
drain.  But besides that one place is just as good as another, where the
only difference is the loot (and still newbie loot, no matter where you take
them).
