I'm always open to enlightenment. Again using WC as an example, I can climb 
high up on the hillside at the zone wall and have no fear of ever 
attracting a mob's attention. The only danger there is someone deliberately 
training me (most would consider it no horrible thing if that were 
prevented while inside a structure). What's wrong with structures offering 
the same shelter I can find in some places outside?
