I am glad there is a limit. Its already laggy enough.

They should also ban pets, familiars and illusions from the zone
and stop all animations. When someone goes into trader mode it
should just load a generic simple trader model.

Then have somone go thru and boot all the assholes that are standing
on top of the stalls. Then boot all the morons selling rusty weapons for
5000pp. There should also be some code that forces you to lower the
price of an item if it hasnt sold in 50-100 days, or stop selling it.
