No.

Note that 
Kazad's Mark http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3047&source=Live
has "Increase Max Hitpoints by 910" in slot 3 and
 
Virtue http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3467&source=Live
has "Stacking: Overwrite existing spell if slot 3 is effect 'Max Hitpoints' 
and < 1405" in slot 5 as does 
Hand of Virtue http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3479&source=Live

Aegolism http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1447&source=Live
also, but with 1100 instead of 1405 and so does

Blessing of Aegolism http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2510&source=Live


It does with PoT9 though, which is the combo we usually
have in our group (65 cler, 65 dru)

which has it's max HP in slot 2.  But that conflicts with
Aego/Virtue's max HP in slot 2 and so bounces from them.

Your best shot appears to be PoT9 and Mark of Kazad - 
1528 hp and 8 mana per tick.
