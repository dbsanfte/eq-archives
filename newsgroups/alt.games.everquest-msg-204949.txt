Ak'anon, Cabilis, Felwithe, Halas, Kaladim, Neriak, Oggok, and Qeynos all
have reasonably safe swimming spots in them, as long as you're not KoS to
guards and residents.

Never been agroed in Highpass, but that could be just luck.

If you hunt in Ocean of Tears or Timorous Deep, you can max out your
swimming just getting to and from your hunting grounds.

You can also get skillups wading in the pools at the entrance of Unrest.
You wouldn't want to go afk, but if you're hunting there anyway...
