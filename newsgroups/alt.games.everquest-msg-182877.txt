This is something  that will happen frequently below level 25 or so, and
less frequently above that, although you will still see it from time to
time. The most important thing, I suppose, is to refrain from feeding their
egos.

As you go forward, learn names and guilds, and as you see them pop into a
zone, either make a decision to leave temporarily and go bank, or form a
group with some other players for mutual protection. Playing on Rallos Zek,
I make it a general rule to do a /who about once a minute unless I'm in a
zone that I know will be very underpopulated.

I also make it a general rule to refrain from dropping below 35-50% mana,
unless again I'm in an underpopulated zone where I know PKing will be rare.
That way, I should always have at least enough mana to escape.
