Im not sure what Marus Seru your hunting in but its not the one Im used to!
Only things that will aggro you there are Lightcrawlers, and Zelniaks, and
if you hunt them long enough, Recusoe.  If you set up camp up on the wall
near the Sanctus seru zone line you wont have any wandering LC's or
Zelniaks, and your right next to a plethora of Hoppers, and if you feel so
inclined, Stone Grabbers. For my level 27 Kitty BST the hoppers give a bit
over a 1/2 blue per kill, and they go down FAST even with the distinctly
non-uber gear that my BST uses. Best yet theres almost no time between
pulls, as Im right next to a steady stream of 'hoppers. Stone grabbers take
a bit longer to take down, but they also give a touch more Exp, and once
again they are so plentiful that time between pulls is minimal.
