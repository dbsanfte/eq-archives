I think you'll find it's bad luck altho it has been suggested it is
seasonal. I cleared the zone of crag spiders once and got maybe 4 silks (all
on one spider) then, the same (RL) day about 4hrs later, I passed thru EK
again and did the same and looted 1 1/2 stacks, record is 8 on one spider
(although some did still drop none at all) Just to clarify that, I didn't
get 1 1/2 stacks from the 10 or so Crags that are in EK at any one time,
when it was obvious they were dropping silk I stayed there.

I think it's just random but I know what you mean. The Crags normally drop
loads but at times it would be better hunting large spiders due the lack of
silks.
