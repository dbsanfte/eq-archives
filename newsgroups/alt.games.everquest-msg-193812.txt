An extremely rough calcualtion:

30 dmg every 3.5 seconds and no processes versus 10 + 17 damage every
2.8 seconds (using the delay of the slower weapon for both weapons
rather than averaging the delays).

30*2.8 = 84                                  27*3.5=94  
84 damage every 3.5*2.8 versus 94 damage every 2.8*3.5

This does not include damage bonuses, processes on the weapons, the AC
and stats granted by the weapons, etc.
