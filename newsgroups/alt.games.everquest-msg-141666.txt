What I usually do with my druid is track to where they are.
Then use and AE point blank spell like upheaval. This nails
them, when they hit you, they automatically become targeted.
Then I just snare, kite or root them and kill them. I usually
get exp but no loot. but sometimes they just poof.
At least they are off the spawned table and
may respawn above ground.
