The only zone on the moon you need to worry about is he Grey.  Kedge
Keep is totally underwater zone, but since you have to swim down to it
in the lake in Dagron's Cauldron, you would not get there
accidentally.

If you actually hunt in the Grey you can get the amulet of the wastes
by looting 3 snake organs off the Shissars there.  They are a fairly
common drop, and people will often let you loot them.  Once you have 3
you just turn them in to a guy in Katta and you have an EB item.  I
think it is the easiest one to get in the game.
