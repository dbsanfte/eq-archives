Oh right i see. So a guy who camps a rare spawn for say, 10 hours, has to give
it up to a passing guy who happens to arrive as the mob spawns and "Wins it by
getting the first hit in"?.
There are unspoken rules about things like camping, its not about everybody
paying the same fee or anybody owning anything, that 'first to hit' is absolute
bullshit. What about a guild that clears an area for hours only to have thier
mob hit first by another guild that just arrived, nobody in their right mind
would think that was cricket.
You dont like the idea of camping in EQ(which you stated, for some bizarre
reason no less than 24 times), why because your too impatient if you cant hit
your mobs straight away and might have to wait in line to get into a group.
When people ignore other groups and just wade in it turns into a petty bitch
fight with lots of bad feeling flying around, thats not my idea of fun.
