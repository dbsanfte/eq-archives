I've only been playing for four months and what I described is the norm
as far as I can see (well for level 20-36 for my bard). This is on
Morel-Thule server.

Of course, there has been 2 (or 3?) new servers during/just prior to
this time and LOY was also released. I know Strom has had a big effect
on HighPass and LOY was before that and before I went there.
