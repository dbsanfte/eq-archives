I like it.  =)  There are some issues involved, though, that you'll have to
get used to.  But I find that the greater mana regen and lack of sitting
aggro more than makes up for any shortcomings.

Yup, that's the major drawback.  You can't duck while on a mount.

That's about all you can do.  For myself, most of the time I move a step or
two forward and simply let the spell get interrupted.

That doesn't always work, of course, when time is of the essense.  In those
cases, I have a dismount hotkey.  /dism gets you off your drogmor.  So I
hotkey /dism, hit the duck key, cast whatever other spell I want to cast,
and when things have cooled down, re-summon my drogmor.

You really aren't going to be able to do any better than that.  For that one
reason - the inability to duck - many clerics forgo using a mount.  We had
quite a discussion about it one day in my guild's cleric channel.  Myself, I
still find the benefits outweigh the irritants, and have learned to work
around the lack of ducking.  You'll have to decide if that tradeoff is worth
it for you.
