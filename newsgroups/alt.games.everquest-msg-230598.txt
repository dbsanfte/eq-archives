Mage epic can be replaced by a bit of XP and a 200pp spell.  All the
time necessary to get the epic will get a mage to 64 with SM2.  SM2
allows you to have a fully buffed pet put away.  The following table
explains part of the rest:

Air: Mean hit 160, DPS taken 55.7, mob delay 30 
Epic: Mean hit 169, DPS taken 78.0, mob delay 24 
Earth: Mean hit 159, DPS taken 68.7, mob delay 24 

This is damage done *to* the pet. Note the fact that the 61 air pet
takes 71% of the damage that Epic does.  Also note that this is against
a 52 mob where epic stuns land, and they are less effective than the
air pet stun.  (Full quote from the Tower at bottom of post)

Now, on DPS put out, on <60 mobs epic does as much as water, but on
60+ mobs its procs don't land.  Considering most of my mage's exping
is done on 60+ mobs, this is an important point.

One last thing - if you are waiting for a rez, and are in-zone with
your corpse, you can suspend a pet and it is there after the rez.

So, I wouldn't even put it at the bottom of the top list.

Actually I've found that armouring pets provides a significant difference 
against PoP mobs aswell. Was going to wait until I posted this as need to 
do more tests against higher level mobs but against the Lvl 52 Blood Ravens 
in PoN here are the results I obtained for measuring pet mitigation 

I parsed 10 fights for Air, Earth and Epic both with and without armour 
(armour consisted of full plate suit and the 4 non bracer focus items for 
105 raw added ac). Each pet was given 2 Walnan blades, mask and girdle. The 
pop pets got a DS aswell. PoP pets were Time focussed and Epic was GoDS 
focussed. 

Every mob was pulled using Malosinia (as far as I can tell no pet spell was 
ever resisted by the Blood Ravens) and then I just healed the pet. 

Mitigation was measure by looking at the mean hit (not kick or bash) that 
the pet took and the dps the pet took whilst the mob was attacking it. Here 
are the results obtained. 

Unarmoured Pets: 

Air: Mean hit 180, DPS taken 60.8, mob delay 31 
Epic: Mean hit 192, DPS taken 88.0, mob delay 24 
Earth: Mean hit 191, DPS taken 88.0, mob delay 24 

Armoured Pets: 

Air: Mean hit 160, DPS taken 55.7, mob delay 30 
Epic: Mean hit 169, DPS taken 78.0, mob delay 24 
Earth: Mean hit 159, DPS taken 68.7, mob delay 24 

Its easily seen that armouring the pets reduced the mean hit by 2 DI's (DI 
of these mobs is 11'ish). 

What is interesting is that despite the Air pet and the Epic casting, and 
landing its stuns, approximately equal amount of times the Air pet caused 
the mob to have a far longer delay on its attacks. The Earth pet which 
doesn't stun at all caused its mobs to have an attack delay equal to 
Epic's. 

I think the reason for this is that been classed as Level 60 Warrior the 2 
PoP pets gain the ability for kicks to stun the opponent. Epic pet been 
onlu lvl 50 doesn't get this ability. I've not done a detailed inspection 
of the log thought to determine if this is what is in fact happening. 

Against these mobs equipping any of the pets significantly reduces the 
damage they take, and it can be seen that the Air pet outtanks the other 2 
(if you define outtank as take less dps from the mob). 

I need to repeat the tests on higher level mobs to see if a) armour still 
makes a noticeable difference and b) does the strange happenings with mob 
delay disappear when mob level goes above 55 when mobs become immune to 
alot of low level stun effects. 

Also armour seemed to have a larger effect on the Earth pet than the other 
2 and I'd need to see if this is repeatable or was just lucky result.
