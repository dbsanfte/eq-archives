Thanks to you and Wolfie, I get it now. Thanks. I missed the part about
having to die in VP *first* then have a guy waiting to kill you at the
bind point. My bad. Now that I see that, it makes perfect sense. And
with my 10 to 13 second zones, I think it would work great, assuming we
still have lower levels in the guild to log in at the bind point.

long.)
