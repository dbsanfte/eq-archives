By that logic, opening your front door to go outside is a "not
entirely negligible risk"....so, everyone in the city opening their
front door to go outside is a significant risk, and therefore should
be eliminated.

Sorry, your logic here doesn't work.

*shrug* If you feel ActiveX for 5 minutes, absolute tops, running on
your computer is too much of a risk, don't sign up for the beta. But I
still think you're being ridiculous.
