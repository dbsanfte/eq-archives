Hi,

maybe the reason for the raids is that every guild knows that the mob will
be respawned right after the patch... and they dont have to wait at all for
spawning again ...

But I fully agree with you =) If you want to be the first again on the mob
you should be aware of the danger you are in =)

I have experienced fights between guilds because they just all wanted to
have the mob "for sure" right after the patch ... bad luck I think ...

We all know the way patches go ....  =)

So have fun

Christian
