I ran into some interesting things with partial groups.  One we
went in with just 5 of us.  (I was round 45) the group before
I got 7 points, but after the 5 of us finished a mission (collection)
I got 11.  I chalked it up at the time to one less player, but now
I'm guessing its just our average level was higher.  The MOB's
seemed to hit about the same, all were dk blue to me, but there
were fewer mobs.  (A LOT less of 5 or 6 in one room, more like
2 or 3)

Another oddity I came across was we started an adventure with
6 but before going into the adventure one of the group members
(52 rogue) went LD.  This left a 52 wiz, 49 sk, 47 shaman, 46
cleric (me), 47 Rogue.  We started the adventure (with me
pacifying the way).  Most of the mobs were dk blue to white for
me (final guy was red).  The thing I noticed most was the
population seemed to be less.  They were still hitting just as hard
as they had before, but not as crowded.  My eyes might have
been playing tricks on me, but that's how it looked.  The dungeons
might have allowances for people who are gone before the start.
I came away with 11 points.
