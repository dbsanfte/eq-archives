I helped a 40 something warrior today with a disease cure and some heals.
He gave me an iksar scaled glove.  Very cool.

Anyway, my druid can't wear them and can always use the money so I thought
I'd try to sell them.  I was in EK and auctioned them for 100pp.  A rogue
said he would trade his ravenscale gloves for them. Nope.  Said they would
sell easier for more. Nope.  The gloves plus 38pp.  Nope.  Then he said he
would trade his 400pp Drakkel forged bastard sword.  I checked eqprices.  I
know eqprices isn't accurate but it usually shows items for way more than
you can get not less. eqprices had the sword for 150pp.  I told him that and
he said not on this server (TP).  I still said no.

Is the sword really worth that much?

I don't want to sit in EC and auction stuff.  I just want the 100pp
(Eqprices has them for 160pp by the way) and I'll wait until someone thinks
it's worth it I guess.  They really aren't that heavy. )

Thanks,

Lewis
