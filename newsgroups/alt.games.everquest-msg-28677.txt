Get FreeWheel. It's a small free program which makes my wheel work with
every program and game I've encountered. The Intellimouse wheel won't
work with a lot of non-microsoft products, but FreeWheel does the trick. :-)

Here's a link. I believe ver 2.4 is the latest. It's good for win95 or 98, not
sure about ME or 2000.
