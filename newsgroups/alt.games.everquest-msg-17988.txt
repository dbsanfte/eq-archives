Having never played a druid, I probably should keep my mouth shut...
Anyway, here goes, and real druids: correct any gross misinformation
=)

www.eqdruids.com and/or eq.castersrealm.com

Well, druids have a lot of spells that neither clerics nor wizards
have. For instance:

* They can buff the tanks with stat buffs
* They can SoW the puller
* They can snare the MOBs (OK, so the wizards have snare too, but
  I'd think they'd want to use their mana on their precious nukes
  anyway ;)
* They can DoT the MOBs
* They can DS the tanks (Do wizards get any good DSs? I can't recall)
* They can be secondary healers, in case the Cleric goes OOM
* They can help the wizard with nukes
* They can Harmony a large camp, making it possible to pull singles
  (Yeah, so Clerics get Lull. But Lull sucks compared to Harmony!)

What'd I miss? Any glaring mistakes? Anyway, a druid would be
welcome in most group, as they bring more than heals and nukes
to it.

HTH,

Rune
