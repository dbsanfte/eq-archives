Nope, honestly there are at least 4 stuns, each on their own timer. 
Used em for years.  Stun greys out, cast holy might, both grey out you 
cast force, all three greyed out you cast... whatever the next one is, 
and by then Stun is back.  You can space things out a little and skip 
that fourth stun if you get no resists, having a fourth is just belt and 
suspenders.

Further, if the mob absolutely positively has to be stunned, its in your 
best interest to have it debuffed, malo/mala lines will help.  But I 
didn't have any where near the problems you are complaining about with 
resists.  Yes, the damage stuns suck, they cost more mana for hardly any 
useful damage, take longer to cast, break mez when all you wanted was 
for the mob to stop moving so the chanter could stick mez to it... the 
only good thing about them is that when Stun is grey, they aren't.

The big drawback of this plan is not your complaint about resists, nor 
your misinformed theory that casting stun one also greys out stun 2 or 
so on, but rather that you have to blow three or four slots on stun to 
make it work, slots that are at a premium if you treat your cleric as 
anything more than a cheal bot.

Oh, and of course that higher level mobs are immune to those low level 
stuns, meaning, as I note later, that the whole tactic which works very 
well in the sub 60 game collapses later on.

Yes, warriors do that little damage. Sad but true.  Same for paladins 
(on non undead) and bards (from melee) Counting their procs for damage 
is a joke, too, when you're comparing to clerics with summmoned hammer. 
  90% of the damage a cleric does with that thing comes from the proc, 
which goes off every couple hits if his dex is up to the roof (and this 
means that a battlecleric puts some effort into getting his dex up there)

That might change in the high end game, mind you, my cleric never even 
finished POP; could be that warriors in Anguish gear outdo clerics with 
the best summoned hammers, I know that sort of thing swings back and 
forth as you level all the time.

The problem with clerics soloing is that while they are wearing plate 
armor, they soak damage as if they were wearing leather, and their only 
respite from that is to heal themselves, which means they aren't doing 
DPS.  Its a catch 22.  Give a cleric a tank partnerwho can hold aggro 
off of them though, and they'll probably outdamage him, even though 
they'll have to take occaisional breaks to heal him.

Wouldn't know, honestly, I do know that SOE changes things around all 
the time as we level up, and I think its a sad thing really, because it 
encourages more and more pigeonholing.  Why the 61-65 game had to be 
twice as boring as the 51-60 game I have no idea, but thats the way it 
worked out for a lot of people.

You're doing it wrong then.

Its (is it snared yet?) please walk along and ignore us while we pound 
on your back for a while, then turn around and walk back to the cleric. 
  Just before you get there, please turn back around and walk away 
again.  I'd appreciate it if you'd use this well worn footpath which 
never goes near any other mobs, and which the dozens of other mobs we've 
pulled before you have used.

Fear only appears random if you use it at random; in reality, from the 
same spot, feared mobs take the same path every time.  So you just have 
to find a spot where you like the path they take.

Clerics lack snare, and without snare, feared mobs move fast enough that 
its too much of a bother to use fear; however with any snaring partner 
(ones with long duration snare are preferable of course) its a nice tool.

Yeah, its pretty good.  What you have to worry about with it is that 
mobs who are in atone range are often also within aggro range, if they 
got mad at you in the first place, they get mad all over again.  It also 
only erases a certain (possibly random) amount of hate, so if the mob 
hates someone a lot, it will take several casts to get it cooled off. 
Fortunately, mobs which have added usually have relatively little hate, 
they haven't been damaged or cast on yet.  So Atone is pretty effective 
at dealing with them if you can prevent them from reaggroing.  This is 
where Lull (and by that I mean the line, not the spell itself, calm, 
pacify, wake, whatever you need to use to get the job done) comes in; it 
doesn't aggro at all, root doesn't aggro much, atone is almost always 
enough to overcome social plus root aggro.  Oh, and the root part is 
important because it parks the mob over out of the way, remember Lull 
doesn't eliminate aggro range, it merely reduces it to "real close".  So 
you need root or something to keep it out of arms reach for the trick to 
work.

Really?  Didn't play past 65 as cleric, or really as anything (66 mage 
barely put a toe in that water before I moved to Combine) so I was 
unaware.  I'd have to see some parses or something before I could agree 
or disagree about how useful they are; from 54 to 60 the hammer was 
actually a nice way to turn in some DPS, particularly once they reduced 
the cast cost.

I leveled a wizard up to 10 just yesterday, and I'm starting to suffer 
from failure to comprehend the usefulness; at my level it seems almost 
any class I've played (and I've played most) contributed more to a 
group, and soloed better.  Is it a case of grouping and pulling half my 
weight until I get up to a point where the class takes off?  Come to 
think of it, I felt the same way on enchanter and... shaman?  Maybe 
more.  Maybe its just that level 10 anything sort of sucks!
