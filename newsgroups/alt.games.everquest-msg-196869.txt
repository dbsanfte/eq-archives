I see a lot of people sing the praises of HHK, but I can't imagine I'll 
ever go back for xp. The several times I was there were some of the 
*most* boring experiences I have *ever* had in EQ. All the goblin rooms 
are nearly always highly contested so the spawns are spread way too thin 
across all parties. I hope others have better times of it, but I can't 
stand it. Sure, the xp is pretty good on the mobs you *do* get to kill, 
but not worth putting up with the tedium. A full group of appropriate 
level could handle three rooms there at once, but it is so crowded that 
that will never happen, don't even try. If the spawn rate was ramped up 
(someone told me that it was actually made longer at some point) it would 
be a nice spot.
