The only reason to kill chromos is that they very frequently drop Essence of
Sunlight, used in human cultural smithing.  Other than that, can't think of
a reason I'd want to.

I used to chant-kite these with my bard, when their dispell was a melee
procc.  It was changed to a castable spell instead of a procc, and that
stopped REAL quick.  Nothing worse than having haste song and your levitate
song dispelled at about 500 feet altitude being chased by three or four of
these buggers.
