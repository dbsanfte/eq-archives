Ahem.....

The other night, when I came home, 
tired as a man can be,
I saw another hat on my dresser, 
where my hat's supposed to be.

I said, 'Wake up, Sally, 
and 'splain this mess to me,
Whose hat is that on my dresser,
where my hat's supposed to be?'

She said 'Hush your mouth, Arol,
You're talking real silly,
Open up your eyes and see.
That ain't nothin' but a cabbage, 
the grocery store may gave to me.'

I been all round this world
to the gulf of Mexico
and I ain't never seen so cabbage
with a hat on his head before

The first hymn of the Church of Professor Longhair.

pious bard
