Hmm my first 5 corpses where from the autoattack key. I almost quit after
the 5th :P

Last major attackkey foulup before I learned of remapping was I think at
level 54 or so when I aggroed some quest npc on a 3 or 7 day timer.. which
my pet killed in no time flat. Which in turn pretty much fucked up a 40
person raid.

Good old times :)
