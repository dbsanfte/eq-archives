I agree with Bill above that it is easier to read (but that's IMHO),
however, it is not the netiquette way. Any one using Outlook (or similar)
will benefit from top post, but I guess there are more widely used News
programmes out there that suit the bottom poster better.

I think all NGs should have a nettiquette thread at the start. That way,
Newbs would save themselves getting flamed, and save me from having to load
the 30+ follow-ups about bad nettiquette, flaming some poor guy. Just e-mail
him with the complaint. That's the anoying part !
