Sorry, which newsgroup is that?  Remember, you've begun posting to 10 
different newsgroups again.  I'm sure it's been posted to alt.dss.hack, 
but it may in fact be new info to some of the others.

Which is not to imply, of course, that anyone actually -cares-...

}Do you HONESTLY believe your piddley little research
}project holds any fear for me?  If you do, then you are more stupid
}then I first thought.. And THAT was pretty stupid...

If you don't care, you'd have no reason to get so defensive about it.  
Yes, your brash show of bravado is realy that transparent, I'm afraid.

(Hey, you're right, th, that's fun!)
