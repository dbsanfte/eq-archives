A common thing for viruses or worms that spread by email is to automatically
mail themselves to people listed in the address book of people they have
infected.  E.g., someone who has corresponded with Lance got infected, and
the virus or worm found Lance's address in that person's address book.

Some go so far as to forge the "from" address to look like the mail came
from someone else from that address book, to further confuse things.  So,
you get a virus that appears to be from Soandso, when actually it's from
someone else that has both you and Soandso in their address book.

Most of this nonsense would stop if people would banish Outlook and Outlook
Express from their systems.
