Granted.  I know that on 2 of my machines I cannot get through PoK without
staring at the ground (damned Verant and their "whaddya need CLIPPING for in
PoK??") and AFing.  But if there's a lot of lag where you're hunting, then
you need to think about not hunting there (especially if you're a healer or
crowd controller).

Impromptu adventures...still no AF should be allowed.  No logging for map
printing.  Someone should give directions on how to get to your destination,
and you should listen to them.

A common example in my guild has been Chardok.  That zone is a pain in the
ass to find if you don't know precisely how to get there...BUT with
directions it's actually quite easy.

Here's directions for those who don't know:

Port to Skyfire & go SE to Burning Wood.
Hug left wall which will first take you south, then east.
Go to p3500, n3000 and hang a north (left).

When you get to the fort, go through the entrance and you're aiming for the
hole just to the right of it.  Chardok is just inside & to the right.

Gawd, I shudder to think of autofollowing to get there.
