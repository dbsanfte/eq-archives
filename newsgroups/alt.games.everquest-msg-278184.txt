Maybe I need to come right out and say that I like the change (at least I 
think I will once my UI is updated to display merchant window contents). 
Therefore you're preaching to the choir.

However, I can still see where the OP is coming from. You said yourself

change wasn't for the best. His mistake was simply not finding out which 
way the wind blew before going off a bit about it.

To each their own. /shrug
