AFAIR the it was the late 50s that they(Marines) ended that, but I could
be wrong, I know that its not done anymore.  I also know that it is

not follow through, without penalty.

is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when

aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
