... and I would /ooc this when the people would complain they couldn't 
tell if someone was fighting the monster or not:

"Target the mob as you are running up to it and use your /assist key ( you 
do have one, right? ) to see if it is engaged with someone."

Seemed like common sense to me.  Was a gnome-induced epiphony to others ( 
the ones who didn't want to KS ).  Was received with "Great idea!" from the 
ones getting KSed.  Was replied to with "You can't KS, this is an Event!!!" 
from the fuckheads.
