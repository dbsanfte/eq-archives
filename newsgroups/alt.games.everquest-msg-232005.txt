Anyone put one of these Augments on a weapon yet?

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=4386

Seems like a partial Rune spell.
Absorb 5% melee damage for up to 150 damage.
Proc lasts 5 minutes, obviously the the damage would use
it up far before the duration would be up.

How often does it Proc?
Is it worth it for tanks?

Seems like it would save a ton of damage in the long run but
it all depends on the Proc rate.

If you were going against a mob that hit for 300
Then it would last 10 hits on average.

Is it 5% before or after the mitigation calculation?
