Mmm. And then you get the grief-guilds powerlevelling one another by guard
duty to 'skill up' then going mass slaughtering the other guards, because
they can. The mechanic to stop 'because they can' has to be significantly
more sophisticated than merely 'Because its inconvienient'. History has
shown people will go to extraordinary lengths to be the most prominent
set of griefers or 'hardcore powerplayers' in a system.

Another problem you begin to run into is resourcing - my ideal game
would have massive massive 'human' tuning of game variables. Subjective
assessment of who the gits on a server are, who's winning and the 
like - paid divine intervention by literate imaginative staffers.

But... that becomes extremely spendy. Look at Legends ;) I signed up
for it in the hope it might end up like that, and left after 2 months ;/

To be honest, you have another problem. If you *guarentee* failure,
sew the seeds of destruction in becoming top dog, why would anyone
do it? Lets build our tower tall just so you can rip it all down
again?

Really, my dream game is one with that sort of divinity... perhaps
rather than a guide programme a 'demi god' programme where long term
players get promoted to avatars of their deity and the deity (paid
staff member) can actually strip their favour if they beign to 
behave out of character - god of protections avatar starts ganking
he's in trouble.

Then, you have the issue of favouritism, subjective abuse. Gods
are whimsical? Sure. But then, its not much fun if you're on the
losing side of whimsy.

Hard one ;)
