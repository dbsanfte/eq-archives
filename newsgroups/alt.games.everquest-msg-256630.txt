Sadly, you are mistaken.  Channelling Focus is reportedly either
completely broken or very nearly so.  IIRC, exactly one poster to
the Paladins of Norrath forums claims to have seen it work once,
others say they've never seen the message or found it in their
logs.  That is far from a noticeable difference.  I think it's
safe to say that Paladins (and SKs) would obviously be in the
best position both to benefit from this AA and to actually see
it in action, being spell-casting tanks.  (It is supposed to
allow you to channel through being stunned).

There is also a Paladin class AA that is worthless, Act of Valor.
You take an XP death to give your remaining HP to your target.
It would suck donkey balls even if it wasn't 99.999% certain to
be wasted on the corpse of the character who was already dead a
second or two prior to when their health bar plummeted on your
display (a problem that plagues Lay Hands as well).

For the ultimate useless AA though, my vote is Spellcasting
Subtlety for SKs.  I mean, get serious willya?  Shadowknights,
like Paladins, use their spells to deliberately generate aggro.
Why in hell would any SK want to reduce the +hate from every
single spell s/he will ever cast?  This AA isn't just useless,
it actually harms the character's effectiveness!

I'm sure there are others as well.
