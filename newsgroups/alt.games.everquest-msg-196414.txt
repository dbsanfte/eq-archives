It's not being oversensitive to anything negative being said about KEI.  I
personally think KEI should have the same level limits as non-grouped
spells.  Actually change that a little.  I think all spells should be
castable on anyone but should have sliding scales applied depending upon
level (ie if you are 29th and have KEI cast on you, it should have the time
constraints and the mana per tic restraints of Clarity).   In this case KEI
had nothing to do with the fact that he was the puller (it helped, don't get
me wrong).  I know people want to make KEI the devil, but it is not always
the culprit.  As far as twinking being bad, well, again that's entirely
opinion.  It sounds like these guys had a lot of fun and had a fair amount
of classes represented so I'm not sure twinking was really hurting anything.
