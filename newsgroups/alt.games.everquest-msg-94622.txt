Just to let you know that I don't /ooc for ports.
However I'm bound in Loio and currently hunting in FM.
I get enough tells saying "I'll give you xpp for a port to yy" or people
shouting / OOCing Want port will pay xx that I can make 50pp+ when ever
I want.

Oh also my Druid only solos. So by your rules I would have to port
anyone any time for free. I don't think so.

Well my time is very valuable to me.
I have a limited play window, and if I am porting I'm not hunting.
I will port for free if I'm going anyway, but if I'm doing it for
someone else at their insistance they damn well better pay. (not
counting friends, guildies or group mates)

Also note that downtime is the only control in the game. The effect of
death is downtime. So would you say "hell it is only an xp death I can
eat it" if someone trained you ?

I have seen this many times. But I don't recomend it.
I don't tout my wares, but if some one says to me (effectivly) will you
give up hunting for five to ten mins to help me, I will say sure, but
what is in it for me.

Yep that's my bad and I corrected it earlier.
Sorry.

By the way thanks for all your useful positive answers to my query.

Jim

I know I should not have bitched in the last line, but I could not
resist.
Looking back I am amazed that biz has not commented.
