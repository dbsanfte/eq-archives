<SNIP>

Midwinter on AB used to be on KB, and its current guild leader is a
personal RL friend of mine, here in San Diego.  They raid around 10-2
PST, and the website says a minimum of 4 days a week (which includes
weekends, I believe).  (He works afternoons/evenings, if anyone was
wondering why he's in a Euro guild.)  They are apparently in the middle
of moving their website/forum, but here are the links:

Current site, about to be locked:
http://www.pravda-of-norrath.com/phpBB2/index.php

New site, not many posts yet:
http://www.travellog.streamlinetrial.co.uk/phpBB2/index.php

And of course they want clerics.  ;)

I was never a raider at all in EQ, so I only played with Midwinter
people when my friend would invite me on Hard LDoNs with them, or to go
to MPG when OoW first came out.  But I never had any problems with any
of them as players, or personally.  I quit before the merge with AB, so
I don't know anything about the other guilds you listed.

Hope this helps!

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
