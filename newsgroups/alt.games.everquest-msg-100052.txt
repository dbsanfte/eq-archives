I haven't had that problem, I stopped using XP because when I'm in 800x600
rez and full screen mode the chat, hotkeys, spells gems etc. where in
640x480 size.  Just wondering if they have "fixed" this or is it something
I'm not setting up right.  I don't have any problems with 98/ME/2K.

I'll try to do a test tonight. BTW what sound card and video card?  I've
heard of issues with SBlive and some of the latest greatest detonator
drivers.  Just a thought.
