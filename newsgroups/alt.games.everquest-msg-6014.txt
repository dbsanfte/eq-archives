You don't really need to get to 29 to start making money off your teleports,
you can do just fine at 19.   You just have to get a bit more inventive.

Like, forinstance, bind yourself outside Cazic Thule, Mistmoore, or Rathe Mts
Hill giant area, or any high level dungeon.   Enter and offer to buy fine
steel weapons for 3pp each.  Then teleport to a town and sell them to the
vendors for 4.5 pp.

ATM'ing can make a fair amount of cash as well.   The Rathe Mountains hill
giant area is a good point for this too.   Mobs generally drop around 60 - 80
gold per kill (along with the 20 - 40 pp) and there isn't a bank that a good
race can use within 10 zones.    I've seen people there offer as much as 450
gold for 25 pp.

That should get you started, at least, until you make 29 and can get the big
money.
