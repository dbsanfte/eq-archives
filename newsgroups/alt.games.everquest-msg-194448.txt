Tried Dulak?  Was making good money out of there with 40ish 
enchanter/druid/monk trio.  The zone is usually pretty empty, and you 
should be able to absolutely rake in the cash loots from there.

You could also probably solo in seb, and probably even PoJ enforcers (made 
800pp there in a couple hours while grouped even).
