Hm... Let me check.

My Epic was soloed by a friendly Uber monk... The rest of my stuff is 
either Bazaar-bought or Elysian armor (bunch of druids get together, 
kill skellies and share each other's dupes... riveting stuff). My 
Coldain Military Wristguard was MQ'd for money. My earrings, quested 
from Bazaar-bought stuff. I did quest my Cloak of the Wise myself, but 
it can't be that memorable because I didn't even remember I had it.

Hm. Let's face it, all my equipment is shit and it could rot for all I 
care.

On the other hand, I do keep in the bank the 2H sword from the first 
Sand Giant I killed, the rune off Grimfeather, and a few other mementos 
of memorable fights, but nothing I would actually use.
