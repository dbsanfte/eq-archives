Don't be boring and just make a holy trinity group, (or some subtle
variation thereof).  Here's a suggestion for you.

Necro - Necro - Necro - Wizard

And you can all start as gnomes or erudites or humans or dark elves (I
think) so you can hook right up day one in the same newbie area.

By the time the wizard gets to porting levels you can go everywhere
fast, and the destructive power of that group (now that like dots stack)
would be unstoppable. The wizard can be your puller and there's very
little that will stand in your way. Also, the necro's can heal before
not very long.

Might be a tad rough in the low levels, but once you get to mid levels
that combo would own the world.
