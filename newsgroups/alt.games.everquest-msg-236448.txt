If we are being honest the argument up to this point has consisted of 
'do it this way because everyone else does' or 'do it this way or we 
will think you are an arsehole'.  Your last post was the first time any 
body has given any "good, intelligent, well thought-out comments".  I 
must say, I'm impressed.  You answered all my concerns about bottom 
posting.  Namely the 'scrolling down three pages of text to get to the 
new bit' problem.  I am happy to bottom-post if it's not expected that I 
quote the entirety of the previous post in my reply.

I appologise if I appeared suborn.  The reason is - I am.  I am 
perfectly reasonable when someone presents me with a valid reasons for 
their argument.  It's when people try to make me change through insults 
and obsenities than I refuse to acknowledge them.

As I have explained before, I do quote the relevant parts of the 
previous post *before* I reply.  The only difference is that I then 
quote the entiretly of the previous post *after* so that anybody who 
missed the last post can read it in it's unedited form if they wish, 
without forcing others to scroll past it.  If I were to quote the whole 
of your previous post before my reply then people would have to scroll 
past three pages to get to my response.  If it makes you happy then I 
will continue quoting the relevant parts before I reply as I have been 
doing and then not bother with the full quote afterwards.  However I do 
feel it will be to the detriment of those who did miss the previous post.
