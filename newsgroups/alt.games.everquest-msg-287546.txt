Another major factor is that WoW has a lot more players than EQ ever 
had.  It's drawing from a wider base, so has a lot more casual players, 
who level slower.  That's going to account for a lot of the bigger 
spread you find in WoW.

Another factor is Sony's emphasis on grouping.  By making it so you 
needed to group (or raid) to get good items and spells, and making it so 
even leveling was hard solo for many classes, Sony pretty much 
guaranteed that only hard-core players would stick with EQ.  Hard-core 
players, when they make alts, just don't tend to linger around at level 
20.  They want to get up to where their alt is near their main, so they 
can participate in all their guild events with either.

A third difference is the pace of EQ at the lower levels.  My main 
character was a Dark Elf Wizard, so he spent his early levels in 
Nektulos, East Commons, and then West Commons.  That was fun, 
interesting, and exciting.  But because of the slow pace of EQ, that 
character pretty much exhausted those zones for me.  Doing any alts in 
those zones would have been boring.  In WoW, on the other hand, I've 
noticed that at the low levels, I level out of a zone well before 
exhausting all the mysteries of that zone.  Another alt or two in that 
same area is fine.  (Part of this is because WoW has an ungodly number 
of interesting quests, and quests give good experience, so I don't think 
it is possible to do all the interesting quests in an area without 
leveling out just from quest experience!).
