Your problem is likely that you changed the PCI texture setting in
your nvidia desktop display thingie control. Go in there and look for
it under advanced direct 3d. I think you mean 512 meg of memory. Set
the pci texturing to 64 meg. Yes, it tells you it does nothing on an
AGP card but it does, evidently EQ uses PCI compatibility for those
2D inventory/Spell book screens. I had the same problem. Once you have
the pci texture mem set in your desktop nvidia stuff you will have no
more mouse lag.
