I can't believe you think being a muck shoveler and gofor for a bunch of
high level characters is anyone's idea of fun. I mean really, do you think
anyone wants to pay $9.89 a month to be the moral equivalent of an
indentured slave to feed a batwing habit? Just what people had in mind, VI
should add "serf" to the list of character choices.

You think it makes it any more fun to bash 1,000 bats because at the end of
it you get 4 pp for a stack of batwings? It is still screwed! Nobody wants
to do it. You are confusing reward with fun. There is a big difference
between doing something because it is rewarding and doing something because
it is fun.

Put your level 50 away and bang bats for money if you think it is so great.
No frigging way you are going to do it. It sucks, hard.

A much more satisfying experience would be had if a newbie could quest for a
~8/30 weapon or at least farm it vs kill bats and rats.
