For me because I like to roleplay mine goes:

Fear not brave %t, I will assist thee!
/pause 2
/assist

I get lots of comments :-).  Notice that the call is normal /say not /gsay.
This means for most people it will generally show up as black along with
most battle spam so if they don't look for it then they don't need to see
it.  The pause is good because sometimes the program runs the two operations
too close together and it fails to carry out the second (and most
important).  See my reasons for just having /assist and not /assist
<so-and-so> under Dan's post :-).

Btw, my other calls:
Inc - /g Here cometh a %t, to arms!
Assist me - /g Assist me in cleansing the land of %t!
Train -     /shout Beware! I am being chased by highly dangerous creatures!
               /ooc In other words - TRAIN TO ZONE!

I felt the train call needed to be a bit more particular just in case
someone complained about there lack of creative interpretation, so I added
the second line :-).
