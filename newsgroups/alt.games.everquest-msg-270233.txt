I did the same thing before my free month was over, and promptly removed the
client.

Cancelled EQLive and removed the client.

Cancelled Anarchy Online and removed the client.

I'll keep WoW for the first six months, then decide on it.  Right now it's
the best fit for my gaming style (and the amount of time I can donate toward
playing a game).  Plus it's fun with a ton of upside with no discernable
downside as of yet.  I freely admit I was expecting the worst for it, given
the potential of the game being overrun with B*Net kiddies.  So far I've not
run into a single issue along those lines.

I'm interested in giving Tabula Rasa a try when it hits OB.  Heck, I may
even try Vanguard. ;-)
