There should be no reason a necro gets upset with you for giving him
breeze or clarity.  Breeze or Clarity is a mana regen, but necro's
have a better mana regen and if they get clarity on them, they can
just cast their mana regen and it will overwrite the clarity, so no
reason to get upset over this.
