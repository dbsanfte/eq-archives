More likely in the heads of overly optimisitc SOE employees.  Not the
management, but the people working on EQ1.

The mature state of the game seems to me to be more a negative than a
positive, but I expect more that a few people will be unwilling to leave the
characters that they spent so long on.

This is going to be the real problem.  How many raiding forces are going to
be actually able to continue, with thier player base shrinking?    And
despite thier claims to the contrary...  I cannot imagine them developing
more expansions for EQ1, when they have another product in the marketplace
that they fully expect to take over as the next big thing.    Once the
raiding forces that do remain operating run out of content... that'll be
another nail.

I think the only way EQ can really continue (I don't mean immediate shutdown
kind of "can't continue"... as games can stay afloat near indefinitely with
a shinking playerbase. I mean continue to be the market leader.) is if EQ2
bombs.  And if it does so, it will happen for the same reason as all the
others have.  EQ has had five years to build up an incredible amount of
content.  If EQ 2 releases with not enough content, such that the players
are bored... or thier content is too buggy to use, people will return to EQ
without actually giving it time to work out the bugs or add new content.

I've tried other games, and talked with people who have left and come back.
The biggest reason I keep hearing is "It's so small by comparison.  There
was nothing to do."  EQ went through this phase as well, Original EQ was a
nightmare past 35'ish...  there were only two dungeons you could hunt in to
hit 50, and they were so camped that a newbie could walk the entire length
with absolutely no fear.  Every spawn point had multiple players sitting by
it waiting.  And there was no raiding game to keep people entertained who
had maxed out, or just tired of the leveling.  Where they got lucky is that
there wasn't a real alternative at the time.   So they were given plenty of
time to roll out Kunark and Velious before thier significant competition was
even close to release.

EQ2 must have enough stable content to keep people busy until they get an
expansion out.    9 to 12 months, at least.  If they can do that, have
enough stable content to hit max level, and something to do once they get
there, then they will retain thier original starter subscribers enough for
replacements to start coming in.

I think the way they explained it to SOE management probably went like this.

EQ is aging.  We have already been around five years, which is an eternity
in the video game market.  As much as we would like to, we cannot go on
forever.   You remember how worried we were about that Dark Age of Camelot
game, right?  Well since then other games have come out, and will continue
to come out that are using graphics engines developed *years* after ours
was, and completely fresh content.  In order to remain competitive, we would
not only need to continue developing our own fresh content, but we would
have to upgrade every part of the existing game system, from the graphics to
the combat engine.  This will cost us almost as much as developing a brand
new game, and does not fix certain very glaring problems, which are built
into the current game too much to remove.  (Complete heal, high percentage
slows, /discipline defensive, massive mudflation to the point where there is
nowhere left to go and leaving old content lying unused.)

Someone *will* bring out a game with better graphics for today's machines
that solves all these problems.   We've dodged a few bullets so far, but
it's just a matter of when.  Who would you like that successor to be?
Blizzard?  Or Vanguard?  Or any of the games that come after them?   Or
would you rather we do it to ourselves?  Cannibalize our current sales so
hopefully after a transition year we will be in a position to have five more
years as the market leader.

Or at least thats how I would imagine they came to the decision to develop
EQ2.
