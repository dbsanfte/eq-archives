That's fast. One tip: at 54 just ignore your exp bar. It doesn't move at
all. Well it does. but look at it every week or so.

That's ncie for naggy etc. However, most cool raid guilds will expect
you to be 55+. Level is *everything* if you ask me up there to get
your spells stick or warriors getting the def disc etc. Talking
