Hm,2 years ago I was doing Ldons with my mid fifty cleric,I think he
had FT4 or FT5 maybe at this time,usual group composition was me
some melees and other dps classes,very rarely a slower,I remember
doing BB Ldons just cause we had a Necro which at least could
slow the undead mobs.
I never bought Kei in PoK(its the bane of EQ besides Virtue IMHO).
Mostly I was pulling with Pacify,cause it was absolutly necessary to
get singles without slower or crowd control.
Even from this time I have no memories of needing medbreaks,and
the usual time to finish a Ldon was something between 45m to 60m.

Maybe your view of the mana regeneration problem has something to do
with that you are playing a Wizard,thats how life is for a Wizard,you
nuke once or twice a fight and sit and med the rest of the time.
We have some Wizards in guild for whom this was exactly the reason
they decided to play a Wizard,they like the so called downtime,gives
them time to chat,no joke.
What are you expecting,chain nuking for 15k ?  :)
Try a Bard or Shammy,people asking me whats up with me when I play
these alts,usually I am very chatty,but these classes keep me busy
full time,I like to get the best out of the Chars I play.

I wouldnt say there was a "massive" increase in mana regeneration
rate,but FT gear is much eaiser to come by nowadays,especially
since DoN(FT2 Aug for 5 Missions oppesed to 29 in Ldon).
There are other more indirect changes which speeded up the gameplay
like Heals on Hybrids were massively updated,from 428 to 1044 in the
case of Rangers or the "Puma"-line of spells for Shammies which add
a proc to weapons;I just came from 2 Ldons with my 53 Shaman,at 51
they get a "Puma" spell which adds a 154 damage proc to melees,and
its not the usual proc rate,its more like the proc rate from the
Cleric summoned hammers,firing for about 10 times a minute,this causes
*huge* increases in dps,its not worth any longer to slow the mobs,they
die in 30 seconds with 2 melees beating on them.Oh,and the proc is
unresistable like the Cleric version,at least I never saw it happen.

All in all I have to say,its enough for now with speeding up the
gameplay,they wont get any WoW players by that but make oldtimers
like me leave if they stay on this path.
