Not necessarily. I played DAoC for quite a while. It's nice (in a sorta 
"gee I REALLY don't have to think about this a bit" type of way). It 
just seemed so .... easy. And while it's nice to get a special item once 
in a while it really doesn't help that it's for a Skald only and I'm a 
Hunter. And no Skald in their right mind would buy it because it's so 
easy to get. The only thing holding DAoC together in my opinion is the 
PVP aspect.. and it seemed sort of lacking there also. Whats really 
going to kill them is SW:G... and they could care less cause they own 
it.
