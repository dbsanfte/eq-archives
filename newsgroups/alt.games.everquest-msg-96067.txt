Going down the list, for requirements I would say:

member roster? Yes
e-mail addresses? No
guild bank? No
policy? Yes
activites calendar? No

I would also add "message board" to the Yes list. It's very nice to
have a central place that people can communicate.

Of course, this depends on what type of a guild this is. If it's a
guild that raids a fair amount (or raid group), a calendar is a good
idea.
