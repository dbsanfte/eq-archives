Recommended level kills it...

For non raiding players (of which there are a surprising amount btw...), it
is a good alternative to WMBS, having only a slightly lower ratio, you willl
take slightly fewer ripostes if tanking with it.

I doubt a reaver outdamages it (37/35 vs 40/40), the stats at 65 are better
than Reaver (unless you need the resists).  Not that i care much about stats
on weapons.

Witness of Hate great staff (47/45) and Windblade are the other good 2
hander buyable options.  The difference in ratio between these four is
minimal, aside from rec level at 65 I doubt you will notice much difference
either way with any of them.

For a price I would say a bit less than what WMBS goes for on  your server
:)
