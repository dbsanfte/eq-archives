Not a good reason though, since there's another zone line that isn't
gonna have 20+ people hanging around. But it's gonna happen, at least
till people get used to the zone.

Just don't count on it in all the GoD zones. Invis seemed to do well
in Qinimi and the hanging gardens but the lost temple (Ferubi?) has
some pretty massive trains to Qinimi the first night, mobs that saw
invis and hit for over 1000.
