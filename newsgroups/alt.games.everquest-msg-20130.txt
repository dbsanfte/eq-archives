Here you say "it only exists in a make believe game world", yet further down
you say "in-game transactions are not legitimate because they do not exist".
Do they (pp) exist or not?

Existence in a make believe computer game world is still existence. I have
some platinum pieces... come to Bristlebane and I will show them to you. You
may not be able to jingle them around in your pocket, and you may not be
able to toss one in the air to decide a bet, but they are real nonetheless.
There are many things that exist, yet have no tangible and/or concrete form.

Sony realise this and that is why they claim ownership over it.

And, here we agree. The "intellectual property" includes the in-game money
and items.

They are not figments of anyone's imagination. They may have been at one
time, but now they are real.

You still have not addressed None's point.... Sony make no differentiation
in the EULA between real dollars and in-game currency.

Who can tell if it is a "legal agreement" or not?  It may be, but I wouldn't
be betting my house on it. As far as I know it's legality has never been
proved or tested in a court anywhere. And, even if it was, it would only be
"legal" in as far as that court's jurisdiction extended. That is, it may be
legal in New York, but not in Soweto.
