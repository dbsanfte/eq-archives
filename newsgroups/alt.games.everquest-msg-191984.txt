No, because there's no good (There, better, folks?) reason to break
the rule. There is never a need to give yourself a stupid name. There
is no harm done to you or real inconvenience by abiding by the rule. I
condemn those who break rules for the sake of breaking rules, and
that's the only reason to break the one in question.
