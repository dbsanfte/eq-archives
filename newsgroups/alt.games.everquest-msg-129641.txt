slow and dot, listless line is not so great early on, in fact I can only
think of a few times where it made a noticeable difference.  stack your
poison lines they do their work in 7 rounds instead of 20.  Make sure he
does not snare before you slow, bard song will not let your slow take
effect, after you slow he can use it and it will just snare. If the bard is
using proccing weapons all he needs is dex and sta buffs.  The secret is not
to find what you can do without but to find what you can do with.
