	I seem to recall seeing patch messages saying they reduced DD magic on 
PvP servers a long time ago.  I did not pay much attention since I had no PvP 
characters back then.  Anyway, my question is: Does a cast happy magician's 
pet's DD spells have their damages reduced also?  And were there to many 
plurals in that question?
