Blue screens are almost always hardware/driver/irq issues. Depending on
which flavor of Windows you have.

If you just upgraded your memory, check the timing in BIOS. You can also
download Memtest86 or Windows Burn In Test to stress test the memory.

Check your AGP settings. With only 16Mb on the video card, lots of textures
will be flying through the AGP bus. Try enabling/disabling sidebanding,
AGP2x/4x, etc. I don't know exactly what the TNT2 supports. Also check for
MoBo BIOS updates, Athlons and AGP sort of have a dubious history together,
but chipset builders seem to have most problems worked out now.

If you just installed DX8.1, then try to reinstall video and sound drivers.

Make sure you don't have PCI cards requiring IRQ's (Sound / Video) in the
5th or 6th PCI slot, since these may not get IRQ's assigned. I like putting
the sound card in the 3rd slot so that it will not share IRQ's with the
Video card in the AGP or first PCI slot. This may no longer be true with
ACPI machines (Win2k/XP) which all share an IRQ anyway.

It may be time to think about a video card upgrade, I don't know how much
effort Riva is putting into maintaing the TNT/TNT2 line. Your machine seems
to have plenty of horsepower in the other areas, a Geforce 2 Ultra 64MB is
around $140, an MX400 is around $80. Get something with 64Mb video RAM.
