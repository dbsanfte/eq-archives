Well, I don't have any experience with this yet, so its hard to really 
feedback it.  Is it a challenge, making difficult choices between the 
three options, or is it a nuisance, making the role of damage dealer + 
interrupter + snarer impossible?  I'm actually leaning towards the 
former, as there are lots of other interrupt classes and a 12 second 
timer already makes us less than ideal for the job... not that I've ever 
heard anyone call for someone in that category anyway.

I've heard groups forming up looking for a snarer, in places where 
runners are anathema or when wanting to kite.  I've certainly heard 
groups looking for damage dealers.  But for stunners, not so much, its 
usually a question (if it comes up at all) of looking at the classes you 
have and figuring out who to put on stun duty when needed.

In 65 levels of playing a mage, I'm very familiar with the problems 
presented by unwanted aggro, so I'm excited about having a way to 
reliably cut aggro down to size, playing even my poorly equipped Berzerk 
I have already seen many cases where we ping ponged aggro back and forth 
between me and the MT; double attack and triple frenzy tends to shoot me 
right up the list and depending on the MT it may be a while before he 
gets it back, if ever.  In addition to the fact that I'm only a chain 
class, and that it splits up damage making it harder for the healer to 
do his job, this makes it difficult for a rogue to do best damage since 
I'm usually fighting from the rear arc, unless the mob spins to try and 
eat me.
