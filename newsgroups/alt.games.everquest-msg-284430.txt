It has since been fixed, but for a while after the "devastation fix" 
(personally, I have no idea what devastation is - only that it is some sort 
of content that, upon release, contained some sort of exploitable bug(s)), 
bards (and other charming classes as well as far as I know) were not 
getting any xp after breaking charm and chanting their ex-pet down. I 
confirmed this behavior at the time, and have also confirmed that it is 
back to normal now.
