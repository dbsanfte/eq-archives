It's not a horrible nerf.  The spirit of XXX spells now summon the warder of
the level it would have been if you summoned your warder via the ability and
then cast the spirit of XXX on it.  Basically this speeds the process of
getting your pet out.   You had to cast the spirit of XXX spells anyway when
you zoned, so you're not really losing anything except having a very green
pet to defend you on the other side.  It could mean the difference between
life and death, but really not very often.
