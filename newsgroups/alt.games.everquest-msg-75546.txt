What is a good role for a necromancer at a vox/naggy raid other then to
summon any corpses (which most people don't need with monks...)

I know necros can do cold buffs for vox but I'm talking about in combat.
I've done 3 naggy raids and 2 vox raids with my now 52 necro and I never
am able to get a life tap off or much of anything else even though I'm
standing right under the dragon. normally, I get resisted or disrupted.

Any tips? or is this about the usefullness of a necro at dragon raids?
