I have both games myself and was all set to let, and swore that EQ2 
was gonna get my money for the long haul.

I had to wait a bit for some RL friends to catch-up to me in EQ2 so I 
played WoW.  What I like about WoW is, I can log on for an hour and 
still get something done because I need no group.  When I do have more 
time I can have any combination for a group.  Just had a group of 3 
warriors and 2 warlocks in an Elite quest.  Another time I did an 
Elite quest with 3 warlocks, a rogue and a mage.  Neither time did I 
feel we would be better with a healer.  That may change in some levels 
but as of level 22 any combination can and does make a group.

I logged into EQ2 last night to give it another shot and got and 
invite for Fallen Gate with my level 21 SK.  We waited forever to get 
a healer (well only 20 minutes or so really).  When we zoned into FG 
stuff was grayed out so no exp until we got further in.  When we got 
to what we should be killing the one healer could barely keep up on 
heals.  I wondered if it was gonna be trouble since every other time I 
went into FG I had 2 healer types in the group.   But it wasn't that 
big of a hassle (it was better than sitting outside begging for a 
healer) until the healer had to go after just 30 minutes.  I waited 
for 5 minutes then told the group I was going back to WoW so I could 
play with any combination in a group.

Don't get me wrong WoW is a long way from the perfect game.  IMO if 
some group of smart folks with money got together they could steal 
stuff from EQ1, EQ2, WoW and CoH to put together a game that would 
pull in loads of cash for years to come.  Maybe Vanguard will be that 
game but I doubt it.
