The problem with the old system was that to get from point A to point B
you might have to run through three zones and take a boat. To do so again,
later... you would run through the exact same three zones and take a boat.

Prior to PoP, I once had to get from the OverThere to SolB. Since I didn't
want to risk my neck with the evil outpost in the OT or losing my corpse
in Timorous Deep, I wound up running through the following zones:

Overthere
Frontier Mountains
Lake of Ill Omen
Firiona Vie
(boat to) Timorous Deep
(boat to) Butcherblock
(boat to) Ocean of Tears
(boat to) Freeport

... at which I found out that the guy who had invited me to a group in
SolB had logged, so I went down to Oasis and offered free rezzes/heals/buffs
for a while.

The rest of the path would have been:

East Commons
Nek Forest
Lavastorm
SolB

Of these zones, only the last three zones were new content to me. The rest
was pretty much a repetitive slog, occasionally dangerous but certainly
not novel. Begging a port was not always an option (the hours I play, the
server is typically underpopulated, and the typical port, at 30 plat a
pop, was way too expensive for me to afford anyway.)

So please forgive me if I fail to be nostalgic about the original
requirement
to slog through to anywhere.

Incidentally, the setup for the new EQ game (port to any city you've been
before) sounds like an ideal compromise to me... requiring you to take that
trip once without the mind-numbing time sink that such a long journey can
easily become.

Some kinds of challenge I can live without.

        ...Ronny
