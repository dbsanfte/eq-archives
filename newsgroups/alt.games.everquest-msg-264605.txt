Heh, I wouldn't be too quick to write off that possibility.

I can't speak to Planetside, I was admitted to their beta and was about to 
start playing it when my SWG beta CDs arrived and I went in that direction 
instead. There's a reason, however, that EverQuest is still considered King 
by many. The game was a masterful success on almost all important counts: 
subscribers, name-recognition, appeal to the hardcore players (moreso 
initially than today) and dumbed down enough to have attracted a consistenly 
large base of new users. A lot of folks here think that it's best days are 
WAY behind it, but from the standpoint of milking the cash cow for all that 
it was worth and providing shareholder value, EQ has been managed pretty 
well. It's one of the few MMOGs that has consistently drawn players back to 
the marriage after they've run off and dated others. I struggled to find my 
sweet spot in EQ for years, but when I finally did I took it to the limit 
and enjoyed the hell out of the experience.

A lot of the dumb things that SOE did with SWG are unique to that game, I 
don't think it's inherent to the company culture. In fact, I think the 
subgroup that worked on SWG is more responsible for these and SOE probably 
just provided infrastructure and resources to allow them to fulfill their 
particular vision of the game. But maybe not, that's just my outsider's 
perspective. As it turned out, the combination of Lucas, SOE management and 
the SWG team probably didn't gel too well on certain points and the decision 
to release before the game was ready and with some dumb design decisions 
(*cough*Jedi*cough) was probably a creature of all those interdependencies. 
No question about it, SWG is a special case. It seems to get routinely 
roundly trashed by serious MMOGers, and at the same time has enjoyed 
phenomenal success from a sales and subscriptions standpoint. So from the 
standpoint of Sony shareholders, SWG was very well managed eh?
