I miss the boats.  They were slow and it's hard to understand why you
should pay someone a monthly fee to sit and watch empty water, but
they gave you a sense of how big Norrath was.  Leaving your home
continent was a big decision in the early days.  Faydwer will always
feel like my home continent because of that.  I don't think people get
that feeling as much anymore.

And we used to entertain each other during the wait and the trip. 
We'd tell jokes, show off spell effects, teach each other spawn
dances, languages, etc.  Yeah, I lost all my 35 warrior's gear at the
bottom of OOT because of them, but I still miss them.
