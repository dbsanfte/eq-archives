I've just broken 180 at 31, and I'm a human... And no Uber equipment
either, my most expensive piece is a +4 WIS Robe of Living Fungus. :)

I can reach 183 sort of easily enough, by replacing my Small Wisdom
Deity with a Totem of Karana (around 400pp) and then saving like crazy
for a Nightshade Wreath (No Runed Circlet for me, I like the bare-headed
look ;) Still, I think I'm going to put a moratorium on small, expensive
upgrades and just save for a big, ultra-expensive upgrade (Golden
Efreeti Boots).
