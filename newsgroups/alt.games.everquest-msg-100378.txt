It's amazing a company with a history of crappy customer service has the
balls to hike prices! Gimme a break look at the percentage increase.. its
robbery like this that can only be described as one thing.. GREED!

I am not opposed to a company making money but my god what an increase!

No wonder Sony Stock has been in the toilet!

Now maybe a list of things I would like for my $3 more a month..

A game that has to have a patch every week or so.. followed by an emergency
patch to fix that patch!

Actual helpful tech support...

GM in game that arent so swamped under that they can answer a reasonable
petition

Expansions that dont cause the user to go speed massive money on upgrading
computer hardware!

Expansions that are actually included in the usage fee, not an additional
added fee with each release...


well guess  those are really more like a x-mas list... and hell its only
March.. so no chance in hell of those happening!

Sony get real!!! Why kill off the best cash cow you have going for you!???
