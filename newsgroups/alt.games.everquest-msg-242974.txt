I had never heard of these allegations and had no idea that Kinsey's work
included conclusions regarding the alleged sexuality of infants. Some very
serious questions are raised here, particularly the apparently unanswered
questions regarding complicity with pedophiles in collecting this data. If
true, it's a new low for science.

I don't believe that scientists can get off the hook by claiming to
dispassionately seek the truth. As beneficiaries of a common community they
share the same moral obligations the rest of us do and that includes at a
minimum NOT aiding the monsters who prey on innocent kids. Sheesh...
