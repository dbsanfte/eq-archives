I hunted there from 22 to 26 off and on, never got a loop, from what I hear,
the Greenwoods drop the good stuff more than Evergreens though.

Also, don't think that just because you can take a yellow or low red
Evergreen that you can head over to Frontier Mountains and take a giant on,
you'll get your ass kicked.  Forest giants have HP in line with other stuff
of similar level, and are suceptible to invis/camo, whereas Mountain giants
(as in FM) have about 2x normal HP, see invis/camo (not sure about
hide/sneak) and will generally kick your ass unless they're a few levels
blue or you're in a group.
