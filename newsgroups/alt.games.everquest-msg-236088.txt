Well, some of the gear I turned in, I would not have had I known how 
little tribute value there would be.  My 71k turned into 2.4k tribute 
points, and I did not turn in any fishing bait or other such items, it 
was all stuff with good stats that I had in my bank, just was not worth 
much in the bazaar due to how common it was or the recommended levels.  
There is one item of them all that I would not have turned in, the rest 
are no biggy, they were named ldon drops that are a dime a dozen in the 
bazaar.
