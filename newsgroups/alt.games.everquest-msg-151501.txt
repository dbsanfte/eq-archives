Last time I checked, it takes mana to cast that pet.  In order to keep said
pet alive, it takes, you guessed it, mana.  Sure, once I have that very
expensive to cast pet, and have buffed him up (using a lot more mana), I can
use him to hold a mob off if need be while I get the heck out of Dodge.
Still, I find that I am highly mana dependant.  I would die to many green
mobs if I decided to try taking them on without using mana.  I understand
the point being made here, but it's still pretty silly to say they are the
only 100% mana dependant class.  If a situation gets to the point that I
have to run, it usually means I am oom, or close to it, and my pet is just
about dead.
