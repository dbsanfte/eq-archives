I leave winamp on while play eq so I can enjoy the techno music while going
rampage in game. The weird thing is that sometimes the music gets jumpy,
like stops for a few sec than play a few micro seconds and stops again, when
I stand or sit at one place for a while. The music is smooth when I'm
moving. And it seems that the smoothness of the music has to do with the
direction I'm facing too. I'm using a sound blaster awe 64, a very old one.
Should I upgrade the the sound card? Does anyone else have the same problem?
