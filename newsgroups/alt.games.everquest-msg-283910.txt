Odd.  Well, as someone already suggested I would just reroll as
agnostic.  As far as I can tell there is just no good reason to follow
any deity as a chanter.  One thing you can try if you want to follow
Bertox, however, is getting him to level 2 and getting him one spell,
Illusion: Human.  Then move him to Freeport...

One thing to think about is getting the Chanter's tailoring up so that
you can make leather padding for your smith.  In the meantime you can
make some raw silk for the Chanter.
