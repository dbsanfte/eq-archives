Are you ready for this? Last night I had my level 30 Ranger KEI'd....

: )

*pauses until the beserk monkies calm down a bit and stop rattling their
cages*

I use it at the end of the paludal cycle as the fast leveling leaves a
serious lacking in  casting skills abj, alt, con. etc.

I just keep an eye out for a someone in the Bazaar auc/'ing "KEI for
donations" and pay 100pp once off for the char and spend the entire time
making sure all the casting skills are maxed out. I did it on my level 27
Magician a while ago and last night on my 30 Ranger. Any Ranger who
remembers raising Conjuration will understand why it was worth the 100pp*.

It's the 3rd time I have had KEI, all brought from within the bazaar from
advertisers and always donating 100pp as I think this is actually cheap
considering it's a level 60 character sitting down in the Bazaar providing a
relatively rare service. The other time was on the Chimp to see what all the
fuss was about, but of course the Chimp being Necro I just thought "nice
toy" but I can can do better any time in the field for free.

*The first conjuration spell you get is a night only castable level 15(?)
Summon Fireflies and the next one is level 30......
