  I have not played EQ in some 8 months. I deceided to play again the other
day.

 My system is not the best, but I am not going to buy any more RAM because I
am totally upgrading my mobo,cpu and DDR RAM in 2 weeks.

System:
  500 Mhz Pentium III @ 500
  Soyo 6va-bab mobo
  128 RAM
  Soundblaster awe32
  ATI Radeon 8500le

 I dont think my hardware is the cause of my problem but I added it anyways.

I installed and played the new EQ Trilogy without incident. Wondering how my
system would play with the Luclin expansion I installed and played it, but
the load times where unbearable. As an example I was on the boat leaving
Freeport and I didnt load into OOT untill the boat  stopped at Sister
Island.

So I figured I needed to uninstall Luclin, I did this with the Luclin Disc.
Where it was supposed to redo my textures and I believe it did. I logged
back in and it started downloading a large patch.(I have DSL with a 1meg
download on the ping test servers at DSLreports.com,It seems there is a
speed limit at the EQ servers). Knowing these textures are on the original
discs I stopped the download and just reinstalled with out uninstalling.

Now I get a MSS32.dll error saying the file is in the windows directory and
not in the application directory, so I made a copy from my windows directory
and put it in the EQ directory, when I run the program it gives me the same
error.

I totally uninstalled and reinstalled the EQ trilogy, The Mss32.dll was
installed in the EQ directory but it still gives me the same error.

 Any help to resolve this issue without wiping my HDD would be appreciated
:)
