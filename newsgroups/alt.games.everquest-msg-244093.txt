There is a back door, but it is exit only...

It's at the top of the geonid mining area...  if you're not careful when
you're hunting there, you'll run right out of the zone...

It drops you into the tower outside the orc city... right into the lap of a
Ry'gorr and a nasty coldain...

And then, if you survive the 2 mobs at the tower, you get the excitement of
running throught the orc town back to CCav's zone... then down the pit, and
back to the geonids...

Hope you have Invis...


If you're hunting there, here is a fun little trick...  Get SOE or Levitate
and go to the base of the hill behind the guard tower...  run fast up the
hill, so that you're launched into the air toward the Orc city...  if you're
careful, you can land yourself on the city walls, run around the walls to
the top of the building with the CCav's Globe - drop to the ground, run in
and zone, with none of the Orc's being aware...

It's silly, but fun...  Naturally, if you fall of the wall on the wrong
side, you should be prepared to fight orcs!  G!
