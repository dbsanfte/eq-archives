I think he used the term in jest and was being self defacing.
D&D Geeks being the Table top RPG crowd and Gamer Geeks being the PC Gaming
(whether RPG or Fighter Ace) crowd. So by any measure he was including
himself in that description so he was not pretending anything.

From what I can see he just called everyone in here a geek, upto you if
you're in denial so much that you take offense of it, another round of "I'm
6'5" and 250lbs of bronzed muscle and my wife is currently working on a
fashion shoot in Milan" would be funny.
