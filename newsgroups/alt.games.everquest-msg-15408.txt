Marking cards is cheating.  Counting cards is using your brain.  The difference is,
ANYONE can count cards if they choose to learn the skill.  Marked cards give an
unfair edge to the card marker because nobody else knows they are marked.

In the EQ scenario, using a bug in the code is not cheating because anyone can do
it.  It behooves the developers to fix the bugs, but it's not the player's fault
they are there.

The whole concept of defining smart, creative playing as 'an exploit' just really
blows my mind.  Apparently, if you don't die, you must be cheating, eh?

Sounds like a fun game to me.  not.
