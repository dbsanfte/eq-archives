You're about to go up against a dragon that AoE Fears, AoE nukes,
chain complete heals.  And you want to bring people who can't follow
simple directions into the dragon's lair?  Correction:  People who

Tell me, do you think having them fall into the pit and sitting naked
somewhere while everyone else kills the dragon is a good thing or a
bad thing?
