True, but in normal pickup groups (read different people everytime),
they expect different things every time. Some don't want buffs,
because it overwrites what they have. Some are annoyed if you don't
automatically buff them. And some expect you to know at every moment
what buffs they still have on when fighting dispel-magic mobs. I would
be very fine with people just telling me what they want and when, as
long as they realize shammy buffs have up to 10 seconds cast time and
wait, till I have mana. Count 10 seconds, you can do a lot in that and
the gem has a few seconds to repop, too. It's also superfunny if
people run off while you cast etc. This happens often, not rarely.
Have that for 5 hours daily and you're bound to get a bit itchy. And
something I absolutely can't stand is people telling "Then
cannibalize!" when I told them I'm OOM. At that moment, my hand is
bound to hurt, since I am cannibalizing since 3 hours. I know my job.

It's not always like this, though. The above is worst case scenario
(which is too common), but some melees actually do have a grasp of
what mana and spellcasting times mean.

Probably. But that's counterweighted by the 600 people who absolutely
don't need it. Like the slightly overweight cleric in group, that
asked for STR all the time in a camp, where you can't run away anyway.
I'm happily buffing him, too .. now that I got group buffs anyway, but
those people should respect they are last priority and treat the
buffer with some respect. Most, however, do.

That depends on what you are already doing. Not sure about chanters,
but sometimes I am slower, healer, buffer, haster, debuffer etc in one
person. Melees get used to long lasting chanter haste and fail to see
I have to rebuff shaman haste every 10 minutes. I would like you to
read through spell costs on castersrealm. This is especially funny on
raids, where (before group buffs) I burned about 18 mana bars for
every wipeout.

Doing that everytime and getting wiseass answers back is tiring. But I
got acumen now, takes care of it nicely.

Wish I could :)

Yeah, but ignoring results into silly fights so often. Ah well...
