Don't AOL regularly disconnect people for using Trillion, with "unauthorised
client access" message or something similar.. (its a similar app for using
AIM and MSN from 1 product)

GAIM is an application for AIM on Linux, but they don't seem to have trouble
with AOL... its released with pretty much every linux distro I see nowadays
too

Damn it would be nice tho.
