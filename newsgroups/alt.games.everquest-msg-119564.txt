Not in the way you mentioned. It was probably the plain blue non-RP PC
name and the fact he didn't appear on /who lists that made him appear
to be an NPC, I'm guessing. Did you target him with F8?

I do know that guides can be NPCs for quests, but that involves the GM
places a specificly flagged character on their guide account. They
can't flipn back and forth their status like that. I'm not certain
about full GMs, but I think they have to create a character flagged as
an NPC on their own accounts, to, in order to be an "NPC".
