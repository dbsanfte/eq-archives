Actually, I think if it's properly explained, they could figure out 
'virus', 'bacteria', and 'immunodeficieny' better than some adults.  
although that last one might be a challenge to pronounce, but that 
might make it fun.  I'll have to go ask my niece.   With my sister's 
permission, of course.

Such a point -has- been made wth a multitude of other diseases and 
problems in a variety of different venues.  Why do you want to single this 
one out as 'too far beyond the pale'?  Are you that intolerant of people 
with HIV, that you don't even want their problems discussed?

}As I asked earlier, do you honestly believe that introducing an HIV
}muppet is designed to teach tolerance??

Yes.  Given that it's Sesame Street suggesting introducing it, absolutely 
no question.  If the show were called "Buttsex for Babies", I might have 
my doubts.
