I finally made it lvl 28.  I went to Lake of Illomen, and the fort groups
weren't interested in me.  Said I should go to FM and fight giants now. Went to
FM, and no one seemed interested in a 28 lvl Druid.  After hours of hanging
around, a group  allowed me to join them.  I had reently hit lvl 28 so my
experience bar was clean.
I fought for a few hours, looked at my experience bar and there may have been a
touch of color to it, couldn't tell for certain.  If any of you have fought at
the Giants Fort, and I'm sure you have, you know how fast the action can be. 
Every time a giant died, I got the message telling me I gained group
experience.  I can only guess that the guys fighting were much higher levels
than me.  So anyway, that didn't work out.   I would like to make it at least
to 29 so I can port a little.  Earlier I found the importance in group play.  
I'm wondering about the North wall at KC, but I suppose mostly high levels,
earlier 40s anyway, will be there.  Currently I'm sitting at the Mill in
Illomen.  Any suggestions on moving through some levels? 

Thanks,
Bob
