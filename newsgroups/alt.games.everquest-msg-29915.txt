Griffs are tough for melee classes, for casters they are the same as
any other mob of the same level.

No, they don't have more hitpoints than other mobs of the same level,
what they DO have is a high melee bonus--higher ATK and AC than normal
mobs of the same level.

This is why level 20 meleers standing toe to toe will often get their
asses handed to them while a level 20 caster can burn down a griffawn
with little problem.

For druids, a level 14ish griffawn at level 19 is a pushover.  

The only mob that I can think of that cons greenish at level 20 but
will beat the snot outta both casters and meleers is Dorn in N Ro.  He
has the same high melee bonus (rogue class) and also high magic
resistence (making spells like root/snare difficult to stick).
