The only reason I say have a limit server is for people that work full
time and want a sorta equal playing field.  There has been so many
times I have played with a person at night only to find him 2 levels
higher the next day when I get home from work.

With all the bonuses they have these days it takes about 3 RL weeks to
get to 60 with out PL.  If there was a new server today it would be 3
weeks from now someone (about 30 power gamers) would hit 60.

 It would be nice to see a server slowy evolve.   Maybe 40 is to
short, maybe 40 hours per character.
