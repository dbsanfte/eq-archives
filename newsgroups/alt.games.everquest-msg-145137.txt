See, if you're going to play evil, you should darn well know to avoid 
everything, unless you know for a *fact* it likes you, to begin with.  
It's quite simple to skulk past Sir Morgan in EK (although that reminds 
me, there's that annoying bard at the bottom of the ramp, does he aggro 
anyone? Not that it matters if you refresh invis before you pass him), 
and I don't think I've ever taken the path through NK in my life.  I 
just follow the river, going around the farmers (who turn green very 
early on in life anyway) and the raiders (ditto the farmers) and when I 
see the bridge, I turn right and head straight for the spires.  Bad 
people may be weak (ie, nek guards), but good people are stupid.  You 
stay 2 feet away from them and they don't even notice you.
