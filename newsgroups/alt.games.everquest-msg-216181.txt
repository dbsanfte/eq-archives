Thats asking too much.  The clerics job is to keep the MA alive.  No wait,
its to keep the chanter alive, and given that he's alive, to keep the MA
alive if he can handle that too.  Oh, and to stay alive, thats more
important than keeping the MA alive too.  So given that the chanter, cleric
and MA are alive (in that order of importance), its the cleric's job to
manage mana as well as possible to keep from causing inordinate down time.
Keeping the rest of the group alive isn't the cleric's job at all, unless
there's no backup healer.  Wizard, Rogue, Monk, etc; they aren't going to
keep a possible wipe from turning into a wipe, but if you have Just a
chanter and a cleric, you can often still pull the whole fight out of the
fire, I know I've done it many times as a cleric, and a few as a chanter (at
30 those opportunities haven't come up nearly as often as they do by the
time you've hit 65)

This is all very tricky, but casting a HOT and a SHeal, well you are pushing
pretty close to the time it would take to get the CHeal off, and spending a
lot of mana thats going to be going to waste when it does.  I'd suggest
either/or in most cases, if indeed casting one at all.  The HOT preferably,
because any tics of the HOT that are left over when the CHeal hit will
continue to operate, healing additional post CHeal damage as it comes in.

I tended to keep 4 heals memmed I think, probably in your case the GHeal as
well as the SHeal; this was because the smaller heal was faster and cheaper,
better suited to quickly popping a heal into a robe (chanter mostly, you
know my views on keeping other robes alive) to prevent death; slow casting a
spell thats going to heal for more HP than the target has lost isnt' really
necessary, and the HOT isn't much good for saving a robe either; he's likely
taking more damge per tic than its healing, and hasn't many to spare.  The
smaller heal also tends to be cheaper than the HOT in raw mana spent, so if
its enough of a heal to top off a light injury, its a less expensive way to
do so.

If you are grouping only with Lenny, though, GHeal is entirely beyond the
point, if he's that lightly injured don't bother healing him at all, and if
he's heavily hurt he won't even see the puny little GHeal worth of points
(every druid and shaman under 51 is cringing at this point, but its true,
you have to chain that tiny little puppy to get anywhere, which is why the
late 40s are hell for a non cleric main healer!)

The word "Ebay" comes readily to mind, but there are other possibilities; a
cleric who's taken the PC DSP OT DL route up can easily have never been in a
group where 20% wasn't adequate for the tank to survive 10 or even 20
seconds of combat (20 seconds for a fizzle or two).  Running in a variety of
groups with a variety of tanks at a variety of different sorts of pulls and
mobs and relative levels is a lot more informative, it teaches caution and
reasoning; stay on the well trodden path and you can be unpleasantly
surprised once the net is taken out from under you.

robes and how much healing they get)
