I would like to see the NO DROP flag removed from gear that is at
least two and a half top-level expansions old. In this case, that
would mean everything up to Luclin, not including VT or Seru gear.
(That's the half.) Then, when OoW comes out, take it off of everything
pre-elemental.

This would allow more players to use new top-level expansions as they
came out and, at the same time, invigorate old content where the
rewards are no longer up-to-snuff for the characters that can actually
defeat it.
