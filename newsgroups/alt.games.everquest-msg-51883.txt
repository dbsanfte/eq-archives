Who? What mob? Where? No quest mob is supposed to take that long to
spawn if it is then its a bug. Are you sure the spawn wasn't out
wandering? last night I heard people complaining in the graveyard that
Mulgrut wasn't spawning. It was because he was out wandering the
fields between the Undead spire and the cemetery hill. 

In any case definitely /appeal that mob. it's not supposed to work
like that. 15 minutes is supposed to be the high end wait on a spawn.
