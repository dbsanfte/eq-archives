    True.  I could never understand why some people
bring stuff they can't handle to the docks.  I've
even seen some bitch, zone wide and at length, 
when no one gave them the help they "deserved".
   Personally, I think that some players simply 
believe that anyone who cons higher to them pays
their ten dollars a month to act like a guard.
Similarly, all healing classes are are duty bound
to burn all their mana to heal a stranger upon 
command, all druids and buff and port monkeys,
all wizards at TP slaves, and all enchanters are
crack dispensers.  Soloing is easy, with all
this free help around!
    I do have to admit though, that if my necro
ever gets to the point where she has a spectre
pet, I very much doubt that I will be able to
resist the temptation to show it off at the docks
in Oasis.  I.... I hope I will be strong enough
to not strip off all my necro identifying gear
(she is a human) and run down the pier using
/y.  Because that would be very, very naughty.
And immature.  But mostly naughty.

    Annie  <--- Will probably be too old to be
                naughty when she gets to that
                point.  With luck.
