My point was that that there is no demonstratable objective difference 
in that comparison, at least with respect to motive.

Suppose he *had* done it for the good of the guild, he might be the sort 
of person to derive personal satisfaction for doing things for the good 
of the guild. In which case his end motivation could still have been to 
derive *personal satifaction* and the benefit to the guild was really 
incidental.
