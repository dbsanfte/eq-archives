    From the EQLive website, at 
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=64016 :

"On February 8th a new server will show up on your server selection list. 
Zek will host the combined characters of the four current PVP servers 
(Rallos, Tallon, Vallon and Sullon) and will use the Rallos Zek ruleset.  It 
is our opinion that merging the four current PVP servers will revitalize the 
PVP environment, adding new challenges and players for you to test your 
skills against."

    So who won the merge pool?
