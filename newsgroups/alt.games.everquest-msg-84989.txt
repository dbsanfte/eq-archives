No, he was simply making a relative cost example. The $9.89 goes to
pay for everything from bandwith, servers, salaries, CS, etc. The
point was just that you can see where it goes in that example and how
you would rapidly use it for CS.

I agree that most of the slack is taken up by free guides. That is the
players fault though. Some VERY un wise people pay verant $9.89 per
month to WORK FOR verant (and possibly eventually get their $9.89 fee
waived) Even once your fee is waived the minimum 10 hours a week you
are supposed to guide is like being paid what.. a dime an hour over a
month? Verant is lucky people are that foolish I guess, or maybe the
rest of us who leech the service for $9.89 are. Thanks volunteers,
because of you making a dime an hour I'll be able to pay $9.89
forever!
