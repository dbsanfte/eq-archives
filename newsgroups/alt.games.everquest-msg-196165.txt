Well God damn, maybe they should just take away mana altogether.  You
can cast any spell any time you want, as often as you want.

And maybe with health they should make it so the instant you lose all
aggro, your health bar goes right back up to 100%.

And heck, getting to level 50 sooner = less boring, maybe we should
give people a button they can push to ding up to level 50 instantly! 
Then it's not boring at all!
