Caeli,

You asked this question at the perfect time.

If your offense is that low, I'm assuming your defense is not maxed out
either? Defense is a wonderful thing and increasingly useful at higher
levels. With my defense maxed out the mobs miss me more times than not. It
is worth a ton of AC.  I found myself in the same situation at your level
and went to Tenebrous Mountains and soloed Grimlings and Aliens at the
Grimling Mines. The acrylia ore sells for a lot of money in the bazaar. Of
course, you probably will still have trouble soloing them with pure melee so
here's what I did. Root and nuke till they are below one bubble, keep them
rooted so that they'll fight and then wade in with your hammer. They'll do a
lot of damage and sometimes you'll even need to back off and heal before you
kill them -- which is absurd when you realize that you are full health and
they are almost dead. But its a completely controlled safe situation since
as long as you choose a good spot to fight, you can always back off to heal
or run and if the root breaks, they run. Of course, you could do this
anywhere, but the loot makes up for the tedium.

As far as offense goes, I'm surprised how often I use the uber hammer that I
beg from those that can summon it. I'm not really what you would call a
Battle Cleric but when mana is high, I don't hesitate to wade in and I do
pretty decent damage. In fact, with a summoned hammer and nukes sometimes I
have to be careful not to not steal aggro from the taunting tanks.

Your main appeal will still be as a healer but the hammer adds a nice
rounding out dimension for those times when you can use it. And don't forget
Bash. Its great for interupting casters. And Dodge.

Speaking of Bash, now is a great time to solo the PHs in order to collect
the cat skulls for the Shield of Bane Warding. It's a really long camp but
the spawn cycle just about matches the time you need to get your mana back
and you might as well do it while you can get good exp for it.
