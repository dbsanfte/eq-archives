Good luck. Your PC looks very similar to my old one (runs 2nd account
now) and I couldn't get the Matrox G200 to work with DX8 for anything,
I admit I didn't spend days on the problem because I knew I could
upgrade. I'd be interested to know if you do get it to work. The 32MB
card I replaced it with helped but it's still jerky as hell!
