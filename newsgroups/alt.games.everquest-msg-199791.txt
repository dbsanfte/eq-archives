    VT has lots of competition, VT doesn't do as much for tank DPS as
farming PoP targets, VT items have lower HPs than equally difficult PoP
targets, keying for VT drains the soul, clearing VT drains the soul even
more. VT has better caster foci, VT has better resists by far, one night in
VT nets a ton of drops. We're neck-and-neck in competition on my server with
a guild that skipped VT entirely and geared up on Seru and BoT, while we had
something like three months in VT uncontested then left it for PoP at
release. Either path works.
