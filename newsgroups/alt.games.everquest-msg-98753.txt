The SMART and DECENT thing... refusing to wake the Sleeper. 

It's not like they can't, they most certainly can as Ventaani has been 
well farmed at this point.  Shrouds on every monk in OOR I think, and I 
believe they may even have been auctioning Salindrite daggers (though I'm 
pretty sure that was a joke).

Point is though, they refuse to wake the Sleeper because they recognize 
how silly it would be.  As many things as you can say about those guilds, 
at least they stood up and said "we're not screwing over the other up an 
coming guilds by destroying warders forever."

I never had so much respect for them as when they made that declaration.
