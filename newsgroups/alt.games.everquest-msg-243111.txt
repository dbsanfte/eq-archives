Correct, today everything went smoothly.  The patcher always changes the
login server back to the default one but damn, if I spend all morning
without being able to login because they have a screwed up server I
seriously doubt they will try and ban us from using the alternative.  So GMs
can log in all day while the poor players look at error 1001?
