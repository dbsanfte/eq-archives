While I'm sure the scammer who ripped off the plat seller wasn't this
naive, what about a better analogy. If you bought a car stereo from
someone and later found it was stolen, would you be justified in trying
to get your money back because you did not want to own stolen property?
Would you return the stolen property to the theif? Is farming and
selling items from a game where you explicitly agree not to do such a
thing every time you log into that game not stealing said items?
