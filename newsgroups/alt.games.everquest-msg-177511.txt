Aye, EQ now can run just like any other standard windows app, you can flip
between it and ICQ or FTP software. (different keys, but same idea).  Of
course, you could do that before, it was just not allowed then.. *evil
smirk*.  I haven't read this full thread, I just flipped to the end (don't
you hate people like me), btw, so:  If you were serious about the 15
minutes, then no, it isn't worth it.  If you were exagerating and you have
more like an hour or so when you decide to get on, yeah, you can definately
get some fun stuff done.  No, you do not need to be in an uber guild.  I
play on Tarew Marr and unless you're in a newbie zone, you won't be TOO
horribly bugged with kewl doods (they usually don't progress their
characters past level 10, usually because their mothers tell them it's time
to goto bed).  There actually is a roleplaying server now, if you are into
that sort of thing.  I would read up on all of the new stuff, becuase in the
last 2 years a LOT has happened.  (I've played since a month after beta
release, btw).  Lots of new spells, new zones, new rules, new looks (
completely different, but you'll get used to it.. even if you loved the
spell gems before the switch), new items, new races, etc.  You'll still run
into jerks, but you'll also still run into great people who will make your
playing time worth while.

Just my two copper pieces.
