Luckily its a strawman. It is not a given that the journey has to be
something apart from the "fun".

An interesting analogy can be drawn, however, despite the poorness of
the comparison. When the lake is a rare treat an hours drive away,
everyone gets all pumped up to go. When you live beside the lake, it
quickly becomes mundane and instead you probably go skiing for fun.
