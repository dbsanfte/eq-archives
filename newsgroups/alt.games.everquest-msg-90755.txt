To be safe do a /who all GUILD ("GUILD" must be in caps).  Of course you can
also say "/gu Hellooooo is anyone theeeerrrreeee?" <g>

You can also try writing your GM (link at everquest's site) and see if they
can help you, but I wouldn't hold my breath, if I were you.

Does your guild have a message board?  A website?  Quite honestly, if the
answer to that is "uh, I don't remember," or "I don't know," just target
yourself and type /guildremove.  If you don't have this CRITICAL information
available, chances are the guild isn't right for you (or maybe vice-versa)
anyway.
