Why would you use /pet report health, with his HP bar now visible to you... and
if you really want a % just hover the cursor over the bar.

Even more exciting, under every member of your group that has a pet
is a green underline bar that is the pet's HP!  Currently I am unable to
click target the person's pet, unfortunately, but I can get a name and
% hp by hovering over the green line, so I can make hotkey to target
pet without having to ask the caster their pet's name and so forth.
