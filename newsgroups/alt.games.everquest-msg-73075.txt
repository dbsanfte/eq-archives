Alas, this is *the* first rule of EQ. Do not die. I know it sounds stupid,
and you will still die, but if you lessen your deaths your exp will take
care of its self.

One of my maxims about the game...Every new zone will equal two deaths.

Start playing close to a zone and run like hell if things go bad. As you
learn a zone you can get deeper into it without the deaths.

Where are you hunting brother? What level are you? How many folk do you
group with?

When you find someone who is good to group with, seek them out everyday.
Trust the friends that you have made, you will die less to friends than with
a pick up group.

Good Luck and be safe.
