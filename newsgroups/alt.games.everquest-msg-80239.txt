yes I was talking generally about the summoning.

the 1st 6, the roamer and the 2 crusaders wont summon you.
the rock golem might - I think he can go up to 53 or 54.

if u pull him and you are soloing then FD, zone, gate whatever- just don't
fight him.

if you can kill the 2 crusaders solo then you are doing better than me, cos
I tried lots of times and failed =)
