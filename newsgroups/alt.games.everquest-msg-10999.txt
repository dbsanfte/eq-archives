Don't know if it's a trend, but it must be profitable. There was this one
lass over the weekend, Kinkelle of the Eternal Lords of Norrath guild on
Bristlebane, who hung out in the Freeport bank for AGES begging everybody
that came in. Gave a sob story about losing her corpse and all of her
equipment in Butcherblock ... and <gasp!>, she had nothing in the bank. What
a surprise! Never heard that before!

So a few of us start giving her the business, the usual "go kill monsters"
stuff. "I can't, I have no weapons!" She was a druid, level 9 ... getting a
rusty to start over with was easy enough, and we told her so. "You guys are
so mean!" and so on was about all she could muster, yet she kept begging.
This went on literally for over half an hour. (Once I get begged, I tend to
stick around the zone commenting on the beggar until they log or others pick
up on the action ... I believe those folks need some negative reinforcement)

Eventually she left with somebody, claiming she was going to go find her
corpse. Twenty minutes later she /who all'd in Rivervale, so there you go.
Lie.

Next day I see her in Freeport, STACKED with high level gear. Just "Uber
Phat Lewtz" from top to bottom. I asked her what the deal was, one day she
has nothing and the next she is loaded. "Oh, my guild gave me some stuff."

THEN WHY WERE YOU BEGGING EVERYBODY TO DEATH AT THE BANK!?!

I don't understand some people.

Same day, Bumby, a dwarf, begged my dwarf warrior in Butcherblock with
seconds - really - of logging on. Seconds. I gave him a bit of the business,
but I had someplace to be and left without hassling him too much. The guy
/tells me to wait where I am so he can go get his high level guy and duel
me. What!? One, if he's got a high level character, why the hell is he
begging? And two, what is wrong with these people that when scolded for
being a lowlife, they want to fight you?

I don't understand some people.
