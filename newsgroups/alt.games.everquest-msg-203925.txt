Ok, so a "rollback" isn't the same as a "reset" of a server.  IE, big mobs
won't show up within an hour.

But does anyone have practical evidence of how a rollback effects spawn
_timers_?  IE, if I had 2 hours to go until a lodi spawn, and there was a
1 hour rollback...would I then have 3 hours to go, or the full 11-12
hours?

Yes, there was a rollback when I was camping stormfeather. :(  Inquiring
minds are going insane and wnat to know how much more insane I'll be
before this is done.

Course, if I'm stubborn enough I'll be able to answer my own question in
the next few days.  IF I don't end up in the emergency room from stomach
acid burning out all my internal organs. I just soooo don't handle camp
stress (really KS stress) well.
