If the spawn timer allows it:

Kill #4 at its farthest from the others;
Kill #3, pulling from the farthest away from the other two;
Darkness one of the pair, then root the other, re-rooting as
necessary while you kill the other one; and
Kill the last one.

As long as the root sticks initially, it should be reasonably safe,
especially since you can Darkness then run to get some range
to root.   Without looking at the range and cast times of the
spells, it might be better to root then Darkness, though.  Do
whichever one allows you to get the second spell off faster
and/or do the first one from the farthest range.

If you can take the one you're fighting of the pair far enough away
from the rooted one, you should have plenty of time to prepare
when root breaks.  Depending on mana, you might even be able to
DoT the rooted one so it's not at full health when you finish the
other.
