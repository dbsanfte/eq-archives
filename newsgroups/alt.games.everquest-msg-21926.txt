They are a nice weapon, but they are becoming as common as
the stone etched velium mace, because they are so common the
price doesn't reflect their value IMO. The really nice thing about them
is that they are light, 2.0 stone and won't kill the wielder's stamina.
On Rodcet I have seen them auctioned anywhere from 200-500 pp.
