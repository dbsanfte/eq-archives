The big question is are you using the crafting skills for more than
just countering failures? The first tier ones push your progress up
slightly, which can be useful in speeding up the process bar to move a
little faster than the durability loss. Even so, it's going to be very
hard to get pristines while you're still an artisan. It won't be until
you're second tier crafting skills when you upgrade to your crafting
class that you'll be able to get pristines almost 100% of the time,
since they can be used to recover lost durability. BUT, you only get
second tier skills for combines within the class you choose. ( For
example, a Craftsman won't get skills that help with chemistry ) If
you want to make runes, scrolls, and so forth, choose a scholar when
you hit level 10.

By the way, since you did get a final product, you did -NOT- fail. A
failed combine means that you didn't even finish the first stage and
only got back a version of the primary ingredient that needs to be
refined again.
