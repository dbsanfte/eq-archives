Assuming you don't want a power-soloer, but want to be able to have
fun and explore solo, I would pick a Ranger. Probably the best variety
of melee, offensive, and defensive spells. You get a useful hobby:
archery and fletching. SOW/camo very good for travel. Ivy armor quest
worthwhile and fun--makes you travel across the world to complete.

Rangers that know what they are doing fair rather well solo.
