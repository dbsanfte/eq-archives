Great in theory, but in practice, the monk generally has trouble pulling
enough taunt to 'tank' over the slowing, doting, healing shaman. They're
clearly superior in pulling than a warrior though. Thinking sideways for
a second, I'll throw up an idea I haven't really heard touted much
before:

Shaman & Shadowknight

SK can generate the most agro in the game when they want to, they have
the ac/hps to be able to tank everything but the toughest mobs, they can
FD to pull, self heal and tap, plus importantly, they can snare. Damage
output may be a little slow, but stacking the dots and balancing the
mana should make for relatively little downtime. Seems to be the best
duo I can come up with, though it's inherently 'evil' aligned, which may
be a problem for some.
