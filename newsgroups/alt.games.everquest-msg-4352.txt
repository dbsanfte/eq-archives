I asked about the game and the community.  Simple enough.

My first four days were spent in defense of my position in this community.

I call people like Nagzum and StanMann biggots and narrow-minded for their
"short bus" references.  I seriously doubt they know anyone with a mental or
physical handicap.  You may well be the same way.  I'm betting if they (or
you) did (or do) know anyone who fits this bill, they (or you) would be less
likely to reference people in this manner.  My point was that they (and you)
speak sometimes without thinking, or considering that people out here in the
real world would probably slap the taste out of their (and your) mouth(s)
for talking the way they (and you) do, if they (or you) are this way in real
life.  I can only presume that they (and you) are people who post here for
shock value, with some useful information thrown in to justify their (and
your) existance here.  Then again, I don't know them (or you).  I can only
go by what I've read so far.

I have no problem with the "trouble maker" label.  I <do> have a problem
with the "short bus" reference.

ox�y�mo�ron (ks-m�rn, -mr-)
n., pl. ox�y�mo�ra (-m�r, -mr) or ox�y�mo�rons.

A rhetorical figure in which incongruous or contradictory terms are
combined, as in a deafening silence and a mournful optimist.

The only reason I would categorize you is if you were to prove yourself so.
Am I to assume that's what you're doing?

Read this post in its entirety again.  I'm hoping the light finds you.
