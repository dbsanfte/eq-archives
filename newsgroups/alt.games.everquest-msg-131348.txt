 Depends on where I want to go. I have a gate hammer and Velious gate
potions so it's easy to get to Kunark and Velious. Luclin being the
tricky part but I only go there when a raid is called (because Luclin
sucks so bad) so someone usually comes to get me. Not to mention I don't
go to FP very often.
