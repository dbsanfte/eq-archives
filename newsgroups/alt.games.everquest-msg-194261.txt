I need a bit of explantion of how Froglog Factions for Upper and Lower
Guk work.

Basically as a lvl 34 bard, I've started work on the Lambet armour
quests. The information says that I need bracers and gauntlets from a
frogluk shin night (but they also drop from a few others as well -
anything with shin in name).

As a lvl 34 bard, I'm not going to be able to fight my way in and out of
Guk by myself and I don't want to screw faction with Frogloks of
Grubb/Gukta, so I'm asking for some clarifications first.

As I understand it, there are three Frogluk factions.
1) Frogloks of Gukta (the frogloks of LOY).
2) the live Frogloks of Guk (upper and lower).
3) the dead Frogloks of Guk (mainly lower).

My theory is that if I only target the undead frogloks, then I shouldn't
have any problems with the other two frogluks and will be able to wander
most of Guk and Gukta without any problems. Is this correct?

Are the undead shin frogluks harder to kill then dead?
Any tactic recommendations?
Okay, for solo, or far better to at least get a small group together?
