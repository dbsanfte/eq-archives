Well, my position is that, if they were great fun, everybody would end 
up mastering all of them, given enough time... Unless of course you'd 
slow things down by reducing the rate of mob necessary mob drops, 
therefore replacing the tedium of clicking with the tedium of pharming.

As is your privilege, but if everybody can provide themselves with 
anything they need, there is no room for barter.

I guess we disagree there, and the evidence I present is how many 
tradeskillers there are right now in spite of the unprofitability, 
tedium and pain.

On the other hand, (to steal an argument from another reply) perhaps if 
Sony restricted tradeskills to one per account, then maybe your scenario 
could work out.
