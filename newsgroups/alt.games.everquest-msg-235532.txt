Usually good advice, but I did get a laugh one day by not doing it ....

I keep a 'don't group with this twerp' list, which I update for a range of
trivial and non-trivial reasons as my mood changes.  I sometimes list why,
and sometimes I forget.

I get a tell one day from a guy, do I want to do an LDoN, I check my list,
he's on it, I tell him no, he's on my 'do not group' list.

He asks me why.

I tell him I can't remember.

40 minutes later he's still begging me to tell him why.

Well, had me chuckling.
