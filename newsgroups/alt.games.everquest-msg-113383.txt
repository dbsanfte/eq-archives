I don't know about you, but I think Verant's policy with second-hand
accounts stinks !
This is the situation I am in - I need as many opinions as possible, so I
can make a sensible decision.
-I have been playing from day 1 on Sullon Zek, gradually building my
character and enjoying every minute of it. I am now lvl 30.
- However, I knew that I needed to buy some expansions to be able to get the
full experience so headed to Ebay, not aware of the dodgy policy Verant had
decided to use - also not aware that the keys for the expansions could not
be used more than once.
- Expansions arrive, and of course when I try them, the server tells me they
are already used. I contacted Verant and the original owner. Verant's answer
was appalling - I am actually considering going to the Trading Standards to
report them - they said they were not condoning the exchange of accounts and
would not support my account anymore. A bit like saying: I bought a
second-hand BMW, but you have to buy new keys from the supplier and because
you did not, they are not going to provide you with the spare parts either.
- I'll be clear on one thing : the account I bought from is NOT used
anymore - the seller relinquished his rights to play and therefore sold the
game.
- The only way around it was to get the seller to give me his account
handle, change the password and enter my registration/account details on
this second-hand account.

Of course, the problem is that I am now paying for two characters on two
accounts. Thank God now Sullon Zek is accepting several characters, so I
want to transfer my lvl 30 onto the second-hand account - even willing to
pay the $50 they require without nagging.
Is Verant going to refuse to do so ? Do I take the risk of losing one of the
accounts ? Has anyone had such an experience ? My details on both accounts
are similar (Name, address, etc... only the credit card numbers differ).

I would really really appreciate your comments on this - I don't want to
lose my lvl 30 character, and still wish to play with the expansions,
without having to pay for two accounts.

Thx in advance.
