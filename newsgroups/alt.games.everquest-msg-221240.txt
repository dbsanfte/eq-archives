Right. That's pretty close to what I generalized, I believe. However, 
having been around the EQ block several more times than I, you were 
thankfully able to explain it better. 

I would ask though, isn't there an AC difference between knights and 
warriors? Shouldn't that difference be a bit more substantial, even if 
not much more?

Do you think warriors can be boosted from Kunark era design without 
screwing up too many encounters?

I wouldn't go so far as to say that. There just has to be a tradeoff. 
Rangers can't tank anywhere near as well as warriors, but they have a 
much higher DPS, hate generation and aggro ditching abilities. A 
shadowknight has the hate generation and aggro ditching (not sure about 
the DPS) but can tank very nearly as well as a warrior. All that means is 
a tighter, more efficient CH chain gets you a more versatile/effective 
tank, right? The warrior difference needs to be more than just a higher 
HP total.

I'm really just thinking out loud here. All I know is that the warrior 
class needs fixing. It doesn't have anything to offer pre-high-end 
raiding as I understand it, and that's just wrong.
