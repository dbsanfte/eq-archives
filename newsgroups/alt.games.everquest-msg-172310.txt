The key point that I've seen lost *many* times in groups is that
the person will use it.  Just because it's Warrior only, doesn't
mean it should automatically go to the warrior, if he already has
better and is just going to sell it.  I've had to really ride my
buddy about his rolling on NBG items that weren't upgrades, with
the intent of selling them.
