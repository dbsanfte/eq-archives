Well, I had always heard that you can get a long string of them from a 
single spawn, last night, we had 143 consecutive Black Reavers, netted us 
11 Jade Reavers, 4 Shimmering Partisans, a couple other weapons, 10 or so 
spells, and several k in cash and cash loot.  All in all, a very successful 
reaver raid.  We had one cleric who took care of 99% of the heals, never 
went under 50% mana, and that was only after KEI wore off.  Ranger tank, 
two rogues for backup tanks when ranger was blinded, and to use as off 
tanks on respawns of the trash mobs, beastlord, enchanter, necro who kept 
the cleric good on mana, and me.  I am just amazed at how trivial they have 
become compared to when I was first doing them maybe 10 levels ago.  All in 
all, it was fun, and profitable.  Also got almost 2 blues of regular xp in 
level 62.  Someone else reported getting over a yellow of AAXP.
