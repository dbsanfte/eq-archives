Attacking the cause of the problem is all very well, but the symptoms must 
be tackled too. Otherwise, anybody out there who has an interest on 
influencing American foreign policy (and with America being the country 
with the most leverage in the world, that's a *lot* of people) will get the 
message that the best way to do so is to kill a few thousand Americans.

I'm all in favor of a radical change in American foreign policy (which was 
coming, anyway, since the end of the Cold War rendered the "better dead 
than red" approach obsolete), but only *after* Bin Laden and Al Qaeda have 
been reduced to their molecular components.
