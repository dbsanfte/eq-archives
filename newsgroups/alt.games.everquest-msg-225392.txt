Exactly right.
What's needed is a "Raid CEO" who is the Big Strategic Thinker, s/he
designates a "Raid COO" who does the actual inviting and group-assignments
and handles the /tell traffic and so forth. Groupleaders in the raid would
be called "Middle Managers," and would by default be added to the Raid CEO's
/ignore list for the duration of the event.

The Raid CEO would receive 50% of all cash loot realized during the raid as
well as a 100,000pp bonus when the boss mob dropped, however if the raid
failed then s/he would be stripped of all current EQ titles, banished to Old
World newbie zones for 6-10 days, and prohibited from leading any more raids
on that server.
