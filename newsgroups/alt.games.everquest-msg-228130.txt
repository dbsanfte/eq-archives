First I must do my duty as an enchanter

/g Please assist tank or desist group.

That being said, As long as you don't screw up, I don't generally care.
However it is like juggling with loaded weapons, one slip and someone could
very likely get hurt. I myself tend to click on things to target, rather
than assisting, when playing my non enchanters... that's a holdover of
needing to target everything else as an enchanter.
