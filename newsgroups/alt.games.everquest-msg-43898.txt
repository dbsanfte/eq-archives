FYI: I've been using a SBLive! for a long time. It was fine until
Verant did the Great DirectX Patch. Since they did that my sound has
been all screwed up. I cannot hear a fight I'm standing right in the 
middle of (I can barely hear it at all) but water noise (say, in LIO)
I can hear miles away. For example, I can hear the lake water sounds 
all the way to the mill, but not the thing standing right in front of 
me that's trying to kill me.
 
 Verant, PLEASE FIX THE SOUND WITH SBLIVE CARDS!!! DO IT NOW!!
