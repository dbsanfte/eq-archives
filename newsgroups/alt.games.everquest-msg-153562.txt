Hrm.... wonder if Jakiss will return to Jakugg? I am not sure how well a
necro and a warrior can fight together...

The above paragraphs all contradict each other. The new role of mages is
/rt
/stand
/cast (spell that makes a modrod)
/sit
and heaven help the mage that doesn't have mana to give NOW.

I used to want to play a mage after getting the necro up high. Now, I don't
think so.

And now, as a necro, my role on raids is DEFINITELY going to be Twitch
Bitch. Our main cleric already has "Twitch me please" hotkeyed. Without
modrods, she's going to use it MORE. And there's fuckloads more use for
necros that Twitch Bitch, but we don't get the mana for it if we're never
given the chance.

This change makes me Very Unhappy.

This offers me a little hope, but I doubt it would change much for Tiru...
my guild isn't big enough to have more than 7k hit points on our warlord.
And CHeal chains made the stress level a lot lower- i knew already what he
would do. I honestly cannot picture this changing.

I forsee a lot of angry folks. I don't want to read the necro rant boards,
but I'll bet there's gonna be a lot of PLed necros soon in uber tier guilds,
botted just for Twitch.
