> what i'd really like to do is port them to Iceclad and camp

    Translocate: Cazic.
    Who says wizard ports are safe?

    Too bad I can't accompany a TL with a simultaneous bind right at the
port spot.
    Twenty or thirty "Loading Please Wait..." 's later and he'll be trying
to figure out how to camp in 2 seconds and delete the character.

    HAHAHAHA, oh that would be sooo fun.

    Of course, I would never do it... but it would really work out the
fustration of being told by one newbie why your ports should be free, while
another asks you for the 175 plat he needs to buy a suit of whatever and
some 44th level spell (well, I'll get there soon enough, and I want to be
ready... c'mon you don't need it, you just charged that guy 15 for a port, I
saw you!  You have tons of money! [sad if this wasn't a true story {VERY
sad, because it is}]).
