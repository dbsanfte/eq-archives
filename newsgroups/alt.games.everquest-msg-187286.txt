Yeah, but how many GM's are old enough to remember the Khmer Rouge
regime let alone know about it. Unless one of them catches " The
Killing Fields" on TV or if they are from Cambodia ,they'll have no
clue.

But serious what is the meaning of your name?
Moulin Khmer, as far as I can figure , Moulin is Windmill and Khmer is
someone from Cambodia or a native Cambodian. So is it Cambodian
Windmill??Unless your making a play on words with Moulin Rouge and
Khmer.
