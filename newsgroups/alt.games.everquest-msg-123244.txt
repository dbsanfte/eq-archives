You should generally figure that the zone to hunt in for the ones you want
will be level appropriate for you in a few levels.  :)

I have been fighting in Netherbian Lair lately, and the Netherbians drop
various spell research components.  I don't know what level they are
appropriate to, as I don't have a research type character.  I am laying my
level 26 warrior there, most mobs are dark blue to me.
