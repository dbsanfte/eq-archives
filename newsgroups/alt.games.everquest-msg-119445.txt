The trouble with NBG in a pickup group environment is that in
most camps, there will not be loot dropped that is usable by
everyone in the group.  That Shiny Brass Shield drops off a mob
that has no caster drops at all.  A pickup group that is camping
that mob then heavily favors the melee, who are leeching off
the casters if they claim the shield on a NBG basis.

The same thing is true when you are level 60 and camping mobs
that drop only spells... if you are a melee you -aren't- going to
need those spells!

NBG is a great policy when you are grouped with your friends
or your guildmates... and its not a bad policy in general because
its a good way to -make- friends.  But its quite possible for
it to be abused, by the simple measure of only going to camps
where loot drops that you can use.

Its interesting how often you'll see someone come to a camp,
stay till the item they need drops, and then suddenly they
are sleepy and have to go to bed, or its dinner time, or
what have you.   In a pickup camp with a list, this isn't
really the worst of crimes, either... but invoking NBG to
cherry pick your item while classes are in the camp that
can't ever get loot (because there will always be a new
face there that "needs" the item) and then bolt is no
way to make friends either.

In short, NBG isn't set in stone, and should only be
invoked where it is either fair to do so or when all
agree happily in advance that it isn't fair, but its
acceptable.

Announce your blatent greed "if the shiny brass
shield drops, can I loot it" before the camp starts.
Or if you are a caster, announce "hey, I'm pretty
much broke, if that SBS drops can I roll on it?"
Key is to ask -before- it comes up, not argue
about it afterwards.
