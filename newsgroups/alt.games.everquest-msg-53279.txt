>>> There was a GM event in Oasis, several orc sized cyclops were trying to
get people to play games <<<

On Prexus, the sky in Oasis turned blood red and the undead population
tripled. The GM was a scarecrow, and his buddies were a ghoul, a zombie, and
a shadowed man. (ghoul was named "Undead Knight", forgot the rest)

The GM had his invuln switch on, so people quickly ignored him and
concentrated on the rest of the undead. After a while, the GM turned off the
switch, and people went to town. Once the GM characters were dead, the
"invasion" was over.

Off the four named GM mobs were looted a LoW, a BS tunic, a crested MM
shield, and ... another weapon I can't remember at the moment. Lot of KSing
happened, but noone seemed to care much.

Also last night was an event in Gfay, giant bixies flooded the zone. I only
know as much as the guy who died and was bound in EFP (where I was) said,
something about them shouting to play follow the leader and then rooting
people.
