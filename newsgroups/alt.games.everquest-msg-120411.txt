It's happened to some of my guildie wizzards... the familiar corrupts the
player file - meaning the lead GM has to do a rollback on the character
(hope they didn't win anything on the night)

Talking of ToV and bugs... I remember our rezzes being bugged one time in
ToV - people got rezzed back in. but zero exp was being restored
