I'm just a linux person but win95/98 are (mostly) 32 bit OS's and really
should have no problems with such a tiny amount of RAM.

I hardly need to point out that microsoft are more than a little
biased. If you've got a machine with 256 meg of RAM then they expect
you to spring for a NT derivative. 

I remembered something about DMA limits but that's much lower (PC
hardware is such a hack). And then I found this cute thing while
browsing...

In effect their disk cache is crappy and if you give it too much
space, or let it select for itself, it wastes memory space on stale
data forcing you to hit disk....which will hurt your performance.
This is really, um.....microsoft.

Thanks for mentioning it though, I have to do this myself :)

No doubt there are other possibilities as well. I suspect the
3D shooter gamers would be the most knowledgeable on how you
can kick win98 around.
