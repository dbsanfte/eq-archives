You won't find much better dmg/dly-wise than the CLS's at level 46.
Those things are sick and a prime example of why the
recommended/required level and nodrop flags are good things. Most
weapons that are better than those are nodrop or recommended/required
level flagged.

Once upon a time, SSoY's were more than good enough at level 50, and
their dmg/dly ratio is 1:3... (9/27 or something like that).
