Speaking from the standpoint of someone who played a chanter to 62:

At your level, get into to 255, then worry about +mana items.

Go to KC and get a supple scale armband as soon as you can survive there.
Screw the stats, it's extended range III - you'll use it until you're 60, if
not later.  The ability to start that first mezz on the incoming crowd of
mobs is beyond price.  (And the plus 5 int doesn't hurt a thing!).  It's
nodrop, so you'll have to get your own.

If your charisma is above 115, it's fine.  There is very little boost
between 115 and 150, and even less between 150 and 200.  I keep mine at 150+
(157, actually) but that was after I got int maxed, +mana on almost all
gear, and a healthy amount of AC and HP.

I don't know what prices are like on FV - but on Xegony, 8K will get you the
parts for a Solstice Earring combine.  Hands-down, the best bang for the
buck you can put in that ear - I know probably a dozen 65s who wear
Solstice, of every class.
