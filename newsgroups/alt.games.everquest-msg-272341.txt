I merely meant that it was such under the assumptions of 100 lblue vs 
100 orange to level. I'm sure the actual numbers will likely vary. The

Bottom line this is the important issue!

Good point, getting 30% less xp per mob is not an issue in a game where 
you can kill 50% more mobs in the same time. (numbers for example 
purposes only)
