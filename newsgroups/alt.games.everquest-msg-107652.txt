I have played a bard up to lvl 23 and thoroughly enjoy the class.
Extremely flexible and can solo or group, so far, with ease.
But I keep seeing the word "social" mixed in with descriptions of
being a bard.

True, maybe in what the definition should be of a bard.  However, I
find that, in groups, I am twisting songs during fighting and twisting
regen and mana between fights.  So I rarely get to free my fingers to
say anything.  In fact, because of this, the bard is my most
"unsocial" character.  

Not a complaint, just an observation.  Maybe when myt dexterity, in
real life, gets to an equivilant of 200 I can play and type at the
same time, but till then I'll be

'Silvrin, the Silent' Bard of the Nameless
