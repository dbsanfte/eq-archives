You need 2 accounts. If you aren't running them on 2 different PCs, you 
will probably want to download something like Win-EQ which makes EQ behave 
properly for switching between apps and lets you do things like open 
multiple instances of EQ from the same folder and flick between them or 
tile them in different windows, etc.

It's good to have anyway when not running multiple characters, just so you 
can switch out to browse the web or whatever without the game going all 
screwy.
