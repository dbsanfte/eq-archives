a) Sounds like a sound card issue. That's funny right?
Cast a spell, you get cast noise, machine stutters
Open spellbook, there's a small noise, machine stutters
inventory, merchant, there's an open noise for that, machine stutters.

try the disable sound trick  (make an empty file called  nosound.txt and put
it in your eq directory) and see if it still does it.

b) RamBooster is landfillware. I'd heartily recommend removing it.
