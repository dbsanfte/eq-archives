Not an expert on this but firstly isn't the min specs for DAoC 256MB?
Furthermore the 256MB min is ONLY for the character models, not the terrain
or anything like that.  They have said you will be able to run SoL quite OK
on 128MB so long as you don't turn on the character models.  And then there
is the fact that quite a number of people are happy that Verant are 'setting
a new standard' so to speak.  Once again, I am no expert and perhaps they
are just being extravagant.

Personally I don't like it that much either, seeing as my current RAM is
under 128MB anyway.  But seeing as I will have to upgrade soon I was
thinking of going at least 256MB, and RAM is not that expensive these days
either (unless you want to go over 256, and then it starts to get a bit
dearer).
