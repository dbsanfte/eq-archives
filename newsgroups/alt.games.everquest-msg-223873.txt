Actually, I think it would make the quests more attractive. The only 
trouble I see would be an increase in the whole spawn/quest mob/item 
camping aspect. That is, of course, provided the items being quested are 
on par with what you might be able to afford. Fewere droppable items 
would contribute to making that the case.

Then again, there is the fact that the game is already flooded with uber 
gear, to be filtered out only through re-rolling or cancelled 
subscriptions. Nevermind. I see now it won't ever happen. :/
