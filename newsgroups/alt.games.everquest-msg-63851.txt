Kind of hard to tell where your problem might be but here is how i would
approach it.

1) Check to make sure all cables are properly connected. Make sure you do
not have one of the ethernet straight through cables coming from the nic
cards connected to the uplink port on the hub (Typically uplink ports flip
the pinout  arrangement of the cable so you can make a cross connection to
another netwroking device using standard straigh through cable) Go to my
computer on both computers and check that the device drivers are installed
and working properly.

2)  Name the devices (as you said you have done). Check the layer 3 (ip)
addresses on each device. Do they both have an ip address? Are both adresses
in the same subnet? How does your cable company assign ip addresses?
Typically for home cable users the cable companies will only assign on ip
address per connection. At my house i use a lynksis router connected to the
cable modem. The cable company assigns the one ip address, the router keeps
this address and assigns private ip addresses using DHCP to any computer
that attaches to the router. This allows all connected computers to connect
to the internet through the router using network address translation,
bypassing windows internet connection sharing (which personally i have never
used) and allows all computers on the lan (attached to the router) to
communicate. If you were having problems getting to the internet this would
be the way to go.

 This however does not explain why you cant talk computer to computer thru
the hub.  the things you will need to communicate are 1) good physical
connection 2) working NIC cards with proper drivers installed and working 3)
Network layer addresses (IP addresses) in the same subnet for example
192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 and 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.0 If all of those
things are present and you have named both PC's and you do a search on one
pc for the other it should connect you.

I am sure there are many things i may have missed but hopefully i have given
you some other items to check. Best of luck
