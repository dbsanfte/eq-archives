    What I think he's saying is that the legs shouldn't be a nice reward for
a level 55 character. The fact that they are due to the lack of alternatives
in WIS-leggings (and monk leggings) is what makes the AC attract farmers.

    Heh. And if we got XP for every kill like we would in, say, AD&D, would
that change anything? Or have the artificial level limits imposed by VI to
try and force players to move on got some special meaning?

    And is XP LACKING in the world? Are there not many, MANY places that
low-level could go to get the same XP, even inside Upper Guk itself? But
no - he wants the phat lewt, too. And he doesn't want to wait for the last
person who's there to move on.

    Funny, I don't. But I'm a poor schlep cleric. And as you said, it's not
like you see Gator Legs being sold on GBay anyways....

    I think my warrior twink, to whom the AC will be blue for a long time,
would still be camped there now, sucking up the heightened cash rewards. Or
any untwinked level 35-ish druid. It would still be soloed, but more folks
would be in line to try and take it - and more folks would be frustrated, as
soloing anywhere ELSE in Upper Guk at that level is ill-advised.

>Since I think we can agree that gator legs are quite useful for mid to
>low-upper level characters,

    The problem is they're also useful to people verging on planar level.
THAT IS THE POINT. Just imagine every 30-ish druid coming to AC to solo it
until they get Legs. Now add in Clerics, Shamans, Mages, Necros, Enchanters,
Monks.... and they'd all feeel they HAD to do it NOW, or they'd have to buy
it at inflated prices. TWC would increase the camp volume, and encourage
farming for plat.

>and since the AC is quite doable for a
>30-ish party,

    LOL, it's doable by most 30's solo.

>what *I* think would happen is that you would get a lot
>more people OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL drawn to Upper Guk.

    Not to Upper Guk. Just to the AC camp. You won't see more people in the
open hall, pulling Idealist/Squire. Or people camping spawns near the
Necromancer. And people won't be making groups to camp the Shin Lord while
they wait. Just the AC.

>But even so, that isn't really the point.  Let's take alts.  The

    People go to the outdoors because they are the safest, easiest way to
get what they want - high level. You require fewer people outdoors to kill
things, and it is easier to escape outdoors.
