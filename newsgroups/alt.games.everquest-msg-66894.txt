Not only have they not put in code to prevent it, they've flat out
said that MQ is part of the vision.  Being able to help your friends,
guildies, whatever.  The MQ is a bug arguement gets old, almost as old
as the rumor that every single patch is the one to stop MQ.  Verant
likes MQ, Verant supports MQ, MQ will stay.

You get caught doing it (with /report and/or screenshot to back it up)
once you may be OK.  You get caught doing it twice and there is a very
very good chance your account will be banned.
