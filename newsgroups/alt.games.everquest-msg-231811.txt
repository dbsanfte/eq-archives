I had a connection for a while that caused LD when there was too much
trafic at times. During that time I told others that I could not group
because I had a good chance of going LD. If they grouped with me
anyway it was cool because I was up front about it. If it happens to a
person they should be up front about it and warn others that it could
happen.
