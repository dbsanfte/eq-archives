Finally got a tiny piece of web hosting space off my useless provider,
so I stuck a couple of the eq-related web pages up there to save them.
(At least until I go rent some new serious web hosting space. I'm open
for suggestions from anyone for good, no-banner, cheap web hosting
providers.)

Anyway, you can see the same old thurg quest armor guide at:
http://home.stny.rr.com/jazzmanian/thurgadin.html

Tiru's wedding FAQ is there as well, at:
http://home.stny.rr.com/jazzmanian/wedding.html

I'll leave them there for good, even though the rest of my stuff will be
reborn on some other hosting service. The Time Warner Bandits are SOOOOO
generous that they give you a whole 5 megs of space for free. (sheesh)
and then have the fucking nerve to ask for a buck a MEG beyond that per
month.
