LOTS of hybrid AC buffs stack (actually stack, cumulative AC bonus),
as evidenced by the ranger line of buffs, many of which include
minor ATK, AC and damage shield components and all of which stack.

Strength of nature, call of earth, skin like <x>, etc.

Is shield of words an AC buff? That stacks too...
