Step 1:  Take your wizard to a nice safe spot, like in a city near the bank or
something.
Step 2:  Sit down and camp out to character selection screen.
Step 3:  Create a new Druid or Necro.
Step 4: Play new character only until you get up to level 50 or so. (If you stay
up late in the evenings, this should take until, oh....... probably Saturday or
Sunday.)
Step 5:  Amass huge amounts of platinum by kiting all of the Giants in Rathe and
various other big payday mobs.
Step 6: Go to E. Commons and Faymart and purchase all of the top end Wizard
equipment, jewelry, weaponry, spells, etc. available in the game.

Now go give them all to your level 13 wizard and go have a good time.  Others
here will *doubtless* disagree with me, but I found wizard (untwinked) to be the
most frustrating, hair pulling class in the game that I've tried yet. I took
mine to level 25 over *several* aggrivating months where I came close to
quitting the game and setting fire to my computer more times than I could count,
and then retired the bastard in anger, frustration, and despair.
