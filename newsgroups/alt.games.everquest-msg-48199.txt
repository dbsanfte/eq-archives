The same reason that the quested golden plate for clerics have stats they
don't really need. Warrior armor in PoH has int AND wis on it (not much,
but some).

Tradeskills, if they are so inclined.

Well, from my perspective, Hate is one of the most terrifyingly boring
places in the game. I will NEVER go back (at least, not until my rogue hits
planar level, cause being a melee on a raid is a blast). As a cleric,
you'll be desired to go, and the armor drops are grotesquely common. Most
raids have more cleric armor than all other armor combined.

>How big of a raiding party do you need to go there for these items? 

Depends on the skill of the players (and their level). For a raid primarily
composed of 46-52s, then probably 35-40 people. If most of the raid is 55+,
then 3-4 full groups can do basically everything up to innoruuk himself.

Well, first obstacle is that you need to be at least level 46 to go to any
of the planes. As to other guild raids, or pick up raids, those are
extremely dependant on the climate of your server.

Likely that the Tunare server maintains a message board of some kind, where
guilds and individuals can state guild intentions. Even on hard-core FFA
servers, there is usually some way for a group to say "we are going on X
date", and you can throw your name into the hate to attend. Most raids are
happy for every cleric they can get.
