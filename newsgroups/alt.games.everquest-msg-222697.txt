And you mentioned HGs yourself, Lance, I was making the point that
rather than fighting over Hill Giants in Rathe you could go somewhere
else and have the mobs to yourself, rather than 15plat per mob, and
having to fight with others to get to it, making a smaller amount off
more mobs, I think would be preferable. Clearly we were looking for
something slightly different here.

Then yes, I accept giants are probably not a good idea.
