  Back when I still played my druid, a Paw of Opolla was the main melee hand
item of choice for a druid who didn't care about melee.  It used to sell for
3k+, I'm pretty sure you could find it cheaper these days, but maybe not.
The quest is pretty rough, though it could be soloed at your level easily...
it would just involve a couple lengthy camps (unless you strike it very
lucky).  An easier to acquire alternative would be a mithril frog totem
(MANA+35, plus some agility, if I recall correctly).

  Maybe with the introduction of Velious or Luclin there are superior now
there are superior alternatives.  I haven't been keeping up.
