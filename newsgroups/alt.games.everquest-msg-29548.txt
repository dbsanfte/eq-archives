I'm having some issues with my monk and was wondering if anyone could give
me some advice.

I need better weapons and armor.. For my level, I know I should be living in
Dalnir's to get my crescent armor, my fighting batons, abd my bo stick.

Problem is, I can't get a group together to go down there (granted, members
of my guild are MORE than willing to help me, but we're a new guild and have
a lack of clerics, and I don't want to take them without one because that's
just leading monk friends to certain death), and pick up groups in that
place do nothing but get me killed.  Pick up groups are also very hard to
come by for Dalnir's on my server also, as I'm usauly the only one in the
place except for a couple of 50+ level farmers.

I guess my question is does anyone know where I can get good weapons / armor
at level 34 except for dalnirs without buying them ( I can't carry anything
so I'm a bit poor)?  My armor isn't the bigist problem (wearing wu's right
now) but I need a light 1hb and 2hb alternative to my fists, because every
level I get, my weapon skills are getting more and more out of reach.

Any advice would be appreciated.
