The smallpox vaccination is pretty darned close. The only difference is 
the specific effect. It would be closer to endure disease than an hp 
buff. How about vitamin injections? It doesn't matter. The bottom line is 
that it's the cleric's ability to provide that particular buff so the 
cleric should be prepared to do so. Compensation should follow. Anyone 
who provides you with the component to cast the buff is merely doing you 
a favor by making it that much less on an inconvenience.

Are you telling me that you don't try to keep dots on you?

They're components for cleric spells! Why should others be expected to 
buy your components for you? Do mages require their groups to provide 
them with their pet spell components before they will cast one to 
supplement the group's damage output? The fact that they are expensive 
components, doesn't change the core concept, it only makes reimbursing 
you all but a requirement.
