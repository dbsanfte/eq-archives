Hah, Verant has never known how to program audio, they couldn't do it to
save their lives.

The only thing you can do is get a sound card so powerful that it can just
suck up the lousy code and make some sense out of it, like an Audigy at the
low end, which is 4-5 times as expensive as the basic sound cards EQ *
should * be capable of working with but isn't.
