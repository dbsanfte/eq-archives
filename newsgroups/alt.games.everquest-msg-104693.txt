You picked a soloing class.  If you didn't want to solo, you should have
picked a grouping druid --> Shaman.

Druids were designed to solo, as were necros and beastlords.  You're being
unreasonable in insisting that you're class be more powerful than the
others.  Would a warrior not have a legitimate grievance if druids were
necessary on raids?  Look at the "big three," Warriors, Enchanters, and
Clerics.  The reason they're so group powerful is because they're gimped in
soloing.  Paladins, SK's, Shamen, and monks are a bit better at soloing, so
they're not made essential in a group.  I'll agree the wizards are a bit
unbalanced, as they are excellent soloers, and the main damage dealers in
groups (not to mention the sheer unholiness of an AE group).  Bards are way
overpowered, but make up for it by being the most difficult to play, and
leading to carpal tunnel syndrome.

They do.  Druids are very viable as soloers, where most other classes hunt
up that hat long ago.  They also have very good buffs, and make decent
backup healers.  Unless your raid group is so stellar that it doesn't need
backup healers.

No, I can't show you.  None the less, druids are very capable soloers.
That's been known for quite a while, even in the murkey regions of Verant's
collective-out-of-touch minds.  Unless the caster balance that's still going
on changes this, I would say that that's enough reason to expect that Verant
thinks that druids are solo classes as well.

Not everything in EQ is spelled out, a little deductive reasoning won't kill
you.  Or do you look at the spell lists on eqcaster, and insist on knowing
where in the manual or website the got their information?
