...Greetings all...

I have a question for you all...
I'm not even near level 20, but already considering the surname of my dark
elf warrior. I am wondering if it's possible to have a surname with an ' in
it..

The name I'd like to choose is:
          Ayrath Shi'tar

Don't know if that's possible.. because otherwise it will probably be
          Ayrath Ravensong.

I hope to hear something from you all... thanks in advance.

Sithe
