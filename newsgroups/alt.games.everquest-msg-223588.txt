The horse's head gets in the way but with the new scroll-wheel view you can
adjust it so that you get a very good view of your surroundings. I hate the
look of the lizards so I chose a horse and I don't regret the plat I spent

I only wish I had more money to buy a faster one, but I can always declick
it and SoW myself, being a druid and all :)
