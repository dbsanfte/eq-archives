I think it's time for you to start looking for new friends, if your "friend"
sold you ANYTHING for 14k if he got it for nothing.

If you solo or do pickup groups, you can upgrade your gear by farming or
selling the loot you win in the groups (assuming you don't win what actually
upgrades you).  If you want good stuff without paying for it, join a GOOD
guild.
