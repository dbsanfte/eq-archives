Ohh Lower guk! My first real dungeoning experience was in my mid 30s 
when I grouped up with some people that had high level mains and we're 
playing alts in overthere. Suddenly one of them asks, wanna go to Guk? 
We had a wizzie in group so off we went. Lots of exp, phat l3wt and 
plenty of death. Got both the weight reduction bags, adamantite epaulets 
and some other stuff I dont remember that night, still the biggest 
reward was the fun we had.

One of the very best times I've had in EQ, lower guk still remains my 
favorite zone and I've spent many hours there (especially at frenzy, 
lost count of how many fbss I've won). Unfortunately at 56 the dar frogs 
turned light blue so exp there is pretty much out of the question but as 
soon as my next alt gets into the mid 30s I know where I'm taking him.

The dungeon crawl when you have a good group (good meaning good people 
rather than the most uber group) is really one of the best parts of this 
game, IMO.

Ahhh fond memories.. :)
