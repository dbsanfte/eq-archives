I say its a game, but I still don't care if you buy your virtual gear.
I like the guys point about fishing. You buy fishing poles for your
hobby. You don't have too though you could just go cut down a tree and
make a cane pole. But You will perform better with a fish-O-matic
which you can buy from woolworths (Or used too). 

Point is if you have money you can do things others can't and this
will always be the way it goes and always will go.

Bitch all you want if it makes you happy.
