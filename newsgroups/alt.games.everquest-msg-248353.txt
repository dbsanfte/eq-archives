You are also dealing with a different segment of the market, with
different issues. If EQ2 gets people in the door and playing.. they're
not going to suddenly jump to WoW upon its release. Something like
Starcraft and Diablo, the other games in that market were very easy to
let go.. and just take up Starcraft and Diablo to see how they work
for you. If Blizzard thinks a 'one strategy fits all' is an option for
all segments of the video game industry, they really need to reassess
or get run over.

And yet they still have a good segment of the market. They also came
out at a time when Everquest was still going strong. Nobody looks to
come out with their core stuff still incomplete.. but knowing
Blizzard's track record I would highly doubt their core stuff is
unfinished or super-buggy.

I would wager you didn't try them out because you were emmersed in
Everquest at the time and didn't want to take the time to evaluate
them if you didn't have to. Its precisely these issues that are going
to fuck with WoW on release if they push it back. If you are deep in
CoH as you are now.. are you gonna go playing with WoW? Probably not
and use any reviews you see as an excuse to let it mature a bit while
you exhaust your interest in CoH. The same thing goes with EQ2..
anybody deep in that is going to use any negative reviews for WoW as
an excuse not to give it a try. Strapping on an MMORPG is learning a
world and a methodology.. and once a game can lock people in and have
the interest, there is very high resistance to change until a viable
in-game reason is given to stop playing.

I don't believe that.. as long as you are there within a month or
two.. someone has yet to truly hook-on to a world, playing in its
lower levels. All that you get by launching first is first look.. but
if there is a 6 month to a year seperation.. whichever comes out after
6 months is gonna get crucified.

Yup.

True.. but it isn't an immediate thing. The first month or so someone
plays say EQ2 they're just tooling around the lower levels, learning
the classes, seeing how the balance is, trying different characters,
etc. Doing the same for WoW when it hits a month or two after isn't
out of the question and a user can then decide which way he wants to
go.. six months later when they're approaching the highest levels of
EQ2, latched on to a guild, facing end-game for a main? Good fucking
luck pulling them away. It is certainly a preference to be first out
of the gate, but not a necessity.

Its something that should be done.. online worlds are a much different
beast than your RTS game they've gotten famous on.

Same here.. as long as WoW doesn't come out many months after EQ2.

>So, whichever one comes out first is the one I'm going to try first.

Of that... the players are almost certain to do.

Fair enough.. i'll probably give both a go as long as there isn't
substantial lag between the two.

An interesting outlook. But if both are being beta'd at basically the
same time frame.. a person can participate in both knowing their
characters are going to get nuked and have a good evaluation of which
they are going to go to on release date. But... i don't know about
you.. but i don't do betas. If i'm going to test a software package
i'll get paid for it k thx.

>Hell of a race to watch.

Aye. Nice time to be an mmorpg fan.

Also bear this in mind... the matchup is shaping up to be a 'Microsoft
vs. Apple' type scenario. If in any way you think that a non-buggy
program can take the day based solely on that... you can reference
that matchup to be shown otherwise.
