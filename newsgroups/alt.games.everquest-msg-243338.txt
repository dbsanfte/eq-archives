I've sold plat before but I dont permcamp anything.

one of my traders that sits in bazaar is a reseller and thats where my plat
comes from. so now I suppose you also hate people who go buy up all the low
priced shit and resell it for a little higher, altho you werent there to
search for the item at that particular moment anyway, or you woulda beat me
to it, and the odds it will still be there at the low price i got it at by
the time you get there are slim. oh I also search the vendors in pok and
pot, so I guess you hate those guys too.

Oh and I do quests like the cloak of greater pernicity, which no component
of that comes from a "single mob only", so I guess you hate people who share
the zone with others also, they are after killing mobs that *might* have
given you the quest item, instead.


You need to get off your high horse bud, resellers have just as much right
to farm items as you do.

as far as perma camping goes, they gotto sleep sooner or later, get the camp
then.
