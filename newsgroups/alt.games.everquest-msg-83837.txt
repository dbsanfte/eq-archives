Tell us again, 3 times is not enough.

Most of the players in EQ are fine but you will run into the zone idiot(s)
like a village idiot...they are rarely endearing idiots more likely not
understanding why you won't spare them 50pp when your offereing to buy
something for 10,000pp or expecting you to help them level, heal them or
buff them when they ask. This is just life, the same people are complete
muppets in RL, I am sure. The abusive ones I doubt are abusive in real life,
I can only imagine they are put upon in the real world (school, home, work,
whatever) and take it out on the safety of the net...who knows.

The fact is, you generally only remember the morons, it takes a very helpful
and kind player to stick in your memory...same can't be said of the idiots,
they stick in the memory far more.

You did the right thing, you  tried to help her when she appeared to be in
trouble then refused to help again, it's exactly what most people would of
done...don't sweat it, move on, use ignore if it helps.
