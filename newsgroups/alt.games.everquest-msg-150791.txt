I'm not sure it's possible yet to have all bells & whistles on (all
character models, emotes, clipping out to max) without having noticeable
issues ("tolerable" does not equal "not noticeable") frame rate issues.

My computer doesn't suck (GF4ti4200, 768MB of 800MHz RAM, Win2k, 1.7GHz CPU)
and I still have to tap down clipping some in that zone.

Maybe with a GF4ti4600 or the new Raddon card (9700?) that's selling/going
to sell for about $400...dunno.
