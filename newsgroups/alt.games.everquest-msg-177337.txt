I will agree with you for the most part. Though it's quite true, I use 
the port books rather than wait for the boats, it does take something 
from the experience. Kind of like having too much of a good thing I 
guess.

With no ports available, it *was* more of a journey travelling to distant 
lands. There was some level of regional restriction for young characters. 
Sure, they could travel to other lands, but there was a level of risk in 
doing so. It was, like it or not, more conducive to a role-playing 
experience.

There is no troll here. Just sounds like fond reminiscence.
