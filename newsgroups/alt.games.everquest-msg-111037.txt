<Anyway, just wondering what you think about players who promote their
twinkdom in order to help them find groups.>

I now have my first twink.  Is only a level 13 Necro, but has better stuff
than any other character I've ever had.  No, I don't have any uber-loot
equipped, but is a semi-twink.
I do not advertise myself as a twink.  Not because I'm not packing said
"uber-items", but just because my character is simply my character.  No
matter what game I play, I have absolutely ZERO ambition to become "Uber" or
"l33t" (god I hate that phrase).  In my personal experience (keep in mind
I'm fairly new) these mega-twinks are often the worst people to group with.
Many times they tend to be whiney little bitches who insist on constant
pulling (something I hate) as if the game was some stupid "race" to get to
level 60.  I'm happy being a casual player for it is only a game.

SEAN...
