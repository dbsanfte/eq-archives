    Playing CoH now.  And yes, it exists, pretty much as you describe it. 
One thing to note is that the lower leveled character isn't as powerful as
the mentor.  They are SK'ed to one level lower than the mentor, they don't
have any access to any of the higher level powers they would have at their
"real" higher level, and they don't have as many augmentation slots that
enhance their powers that a higher level person would have.  I've been SK'd
many, many times by as many as 30 levels, and I can tell you that I felt
pretty gimp in comparison to the rest of the party. 

    Also, it should be noted that experience gained scales down.   Taking
totally made up numbers, let's say that it takes me 1000 exp for me to
level from level 10 to 11.  And even con kill, soloed, gives me 25 exp.  An
even con kill, in a group of say 4 others who are the same level as me,
gives 10 exp (did I say these numbers are totally made up?  I'm not so good
at remembering real numbers like this!).  Let's say I am SK'd into a group
of 4, and they are around level 30.  A level 30 in the group might be
making 50 exp per kill, but my exp would be scaled back to the 10 exp I'd
get in a liked leveled group.

    This means a couple of things.  One, I can play with my friends, and
have fun with them, regardless of what level I am.  My performance suffers
somewhat in a grouping situation when I do, and I don't get vast amounts of
"free" experience for joining a higher leveled team.  I do get good
experience, because at higher levels characters in CoH tend to just mow
through mobs of mobs.  But... I know I to a degree holding the team back a
bit by being there, and I'm sure the team knows it as well.  They invite me
because they like having me around, and are willing to put up with the
lowered efficiency I bring to the table.  I don't think that random groups
of higher leveled characters are particularly eager to mentor random lower
leveled characters just for the hell of it. 

   I really don't see why fantasy based MMORPG's don't adopt a similar
device to allow mixed level grouping.  If it were in place, I know that I
for one would probably have played EQ for longer than I did, maybe still be
playing now.
