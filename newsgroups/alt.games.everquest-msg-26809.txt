I'm not commenting on what you're doing with your friends. Tell me how
your bitching at this newsgroup helps them?
And you ARE coming across as highly judgemental about what they choose
to do with their spare time as opposed to what you think they should.

(Bear in mind, I am fully aware of the fact that people do get sucked
in too far. The point is, you're not doing anyone any good by acting
like a patronizing, raving lunatic here)
