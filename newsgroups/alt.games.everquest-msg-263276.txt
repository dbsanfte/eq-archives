You're preachin' to the choir, there. Still, it's typically been in 
coding for some time before anyone has the gall to try and profit from 
it.

That distinction doesn't change anything. My opinion was that the 
"won't" do it in the future either, because it's just a ridiculous 
concept. People won't buy into a title that the developer doesn't even 
feel strongly enough to invest in yet themselves.

Of course that happens. I've never seen a game far enough along to start 
taking people's money tank though.

Er...I was thinking that Dawn was the marketing name given to the Euro 
version of EQ by UbiSoft. Now it seems to me that that was a UO title, 
right? Regardless, they weren't about to sell pre-orders before they were 
sure it was gonna launch. Again, for reasons I mentioned above, not to 
mention the legal risks involved.

I don't know where you got the idea that they relegate PR to the bottom 
of their priority list. The fact that there are many whiny players 
"allegedly" disgruntled ("allegedly" because they are obviously not upset 
enough to cancel their accounts, by and large) does not mean SoE has no 
interest in PR.

Consider vALVE software selling pre-orders for their next big title, only 
to scrap plans in the design stage. How do you think the gaming public 
would react to that? It would spell doom for any chance of future pre-
sales for the company, not to mention their reputation in general. 
*That's* the PR risk to which I was referring. SoE isn't about to sell 
pre-orders until they are certain of product launch, much less already 
coding.

Fair enough. There is little doubt in my mind, however, that the public 
won't tolerate it. It's difficult enough as it is to get people to accept 
the idea of a monthly fee to play, much less pay money for potential 
vaporware.
