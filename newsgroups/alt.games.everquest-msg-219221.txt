Overstated.   The warrior, rogue and ranger epics all add about 20 ATK, or
the equivalent of Vengence IV.   It makes the Rogue and Ranger offhand
slightly more useful for a while, but not "extreme endgame" by any means.

The item haste cap of 41% is one of the very few that they have never
mudflated (if thats a word).   So even very old items like the Cloak of
Flames are still useful in reaching your haste cap.  You'll sacrafice some
stats compared to the newest OMFG gear, but the haste is worth it.  As such,
after 5 or 6 expansions, there are many items that have been introduced that
get up to the 41% level.

All are raid drops though, so... hard for me to classify a raid drop of any
kind as "easy" to obtain.
