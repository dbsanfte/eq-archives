Nope, but only one can be logged in at a time.

No, for each account, you have to purchase 1 copy of the software and
1 copy of each expansion you want to activate on that account. To your
second question, yes. In fact, you can access any account from any
computer with the software installed as long as you know the username
and password.

Nope. You can pick and choose which expansions you want to install and
activate.
