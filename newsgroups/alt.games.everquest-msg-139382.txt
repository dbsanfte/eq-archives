When you die, you lose X experience, and your body falls to the ground.  You
can stay that way for a while, waiting for a res.  A res will bring you back
to life, but you still lose the X experience.  Instead of waiting for a res,
you can type /release, and your body gets replaces with a gravestone, and
you respawn at your bind point with all your equipment, with another X
experience gone, and with your constitution reduced by 3.  You can fix the
con loss by paying an NPC healer (there is usually one near bindable areas).
If you return to your gravestone and /pray, you get back that second X
experience.

So, to summarize, death in DAoC can have one of the following three
outcomes:

1. (res case) Lose X experience, stay at place of death.

2. (pray case) Lose X experience, lose some money (to buy back con), and
lose travel time to get back to your grave.

3. (walk away case) Lose 2X exerpience, lose some money (to buy back con).

First death at a given level is 1/3 normal XP and con loss.  Second death is
2/3 normal.  Death below something like level 6 has no XP or con loss.  From
6 to 12 (don't remember exact levels), loss is scaled down.  XP loss is
capped at the amount of XP you have in the level, so you can't lose a level
from death.

There is much disagreement over whether the DAoC death penalty is bigger or
smaller than the EQ penalty.  In EQ, with a high level Cleric res, you can
get rid of almost all noticable XP loss.  In DAoC, you are stuck with some
XP loss (unless you are so close to the start of a level that you hit that
cap), so a high level death usually almost always costs you a fair amount of
play time.

On the other hand...no corpse recovery.  In EQ, when I die, and my stuff is
on my corpse, I'm left with something like half my normal mana pool, and I
don't have components for some of my spells (e.g., can't levitate, can't use
damage absorber).  If I couldn't handle whatever it was that killed me
*with* all my stuff...handling it naked is pretty darned annoying!  Result:
a lot of time spent organizing corpse recovery.

Which penalty is bigger probably depends on play style.  As a mostly solo
player, I find the EQ penalty bigger.  Someone who mostly groups, especially
with a regular group, would probably find the DAoC penalty bigger.
