Amen on SO much of what you just said.  :)  One addition:  The dungeon
selection offered is based on the average participation history of the
group.  In short, the more you do of one kind of adventure, the less you're
going to be offered it.  If your groups never get slaughters, go ahead and
take some of the others for a few days and you'll start getting more.

I don't know why they want to push our hand like that though; each adventure
has its pros and cons that balance it with the others.  Collection is a true
race against the clock (and as a result, a sheer slaughterfest).  Rescue
requires a 60% kill rate and that you get an NPC back to the zone safe.
Assassination involves a 60% kill rate and a difficult boss mob, plus his
cronies.  Slaughter is more straight forward and you probably kill less
mobs, but those mobs are considerably harder.

But I still love LDON.  It's what got me back into EQ, just when I was
wondering if anything could.
