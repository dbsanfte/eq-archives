I think the OP was complaining that someone who is anon shouldn't be asking
for buffs from those who aren't.  I tend to agree that it's rude to ask for
something if you are not prepared to do the same. 

I'll skip my rant that /role should do nothing except change your name
color, and /anon should stack with it if you think that seeing class and
level hurts roleplaying.

I wish everyone were so smart.  The number of times someone has come up to me
(wearing a robe, carrying my snake or eyeball staff) and asked for SoW, a rez,
or a port is unbelievable.

That said, buff/rez beggars shouldn't be blamed, nor should those who choose
to help or not to help.  It's part of the game, and a polite "sorry, I'm busy
just now" should be enough.  If someone pesters you after that, feel free
to respond "sure, but it'll be a few minutes" and then /ignore and forget
about 'em.
