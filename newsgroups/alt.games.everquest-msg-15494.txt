What did she do wrong? She lost the account key. That's
all. I cannot locate mine either. It's been over a year 
and a half since I installed EQ and I'm afraid I've misplaced 
MY original account key as well. I have a second CD I bought
later to install on a second computer but that will not help
if I lose the password on my first account.
 
 And yes, a class action lawsuit is a bunch of people suing
to correct a problem that affect all of them. And this problem
does affect every single EQ player if Verant will not help
restore passwords to people simply because they have lost 
their account key. 
 
 Giving out a password or selling an account is one thing
but simply losing a piece of plastic with a small piece of
paper on it is a completely different matter and should not
result in the loss of a yeah and a half of work on an account.
