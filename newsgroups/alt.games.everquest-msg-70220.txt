My troll BL has hit 11 with little effort, just played in spare time
when friends aren't around.  The only boost I've given him was a
levitate to get him out from behind a tree when he got stuck and while
he isn't exactly rich (40pp in bank) he is well dressed and armed, or at
least as well as he needs to be.  Able to take down yellow casters and
still be alive at the end.  If he can do that without any twinking I
can't imagine why anyone would feel that they had to give up playing
their BL cause they couldn't twink it with one specific item.  If he is
that much of a gimp that fungi wasn't gonna help much anyway.
