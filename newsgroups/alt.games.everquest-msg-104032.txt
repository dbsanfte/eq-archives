Got windows 2000 myself... and have no trouble getting my computers to work
together...

My friend has windows 98 on both of his computers... he has the networked
together via a cross over cable between two network cards... my question is
how do I get them to network together? I know it's probably a question that
can't be answered simply so if all ya can give me is links to 'How to'
guides that I can understand I'd really appreciate it...

thanks for putting up with my ot...

Peace
