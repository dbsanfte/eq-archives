I happened to have read this myself yesterday (I got behind on LTM news).  I
didn't think this is what he was talking about because I strongly disagree
with his conclusion.

Brad didn't know that the summon time was.  He goofed.  Didn't see that as a
big deal.  So far in every encounter with summoning critters being summoned
was no big deal.  I suppose it's possible that extremely high end critters
are different but I've never been killed as a result of being summoned
(enchanter) in critters up to the low 60s.

I saw nothing that indicated that Jeff Butler was in charge of meting out
punishment, nor did I see anywhere that indicated he was the only witness or
the only one investigating the allegations.   But perhaps I missed it...if
so, please quote it (link left in as a convenience).

Brad quoted guild chat showing damned strong evidence that they knew they
were doing something wrong.   Looking at the log also indicates (to me) that
it's a guild full of d00ds and their adamant protestations that they didn't
MEAN "exploit" when they said "sploit" simply doesn't hold a hell of a lot
of water with me.

Leathergoddess can adamantly protest and claim that he's not an idiot, but
that doesn't make it true.  Pres Bush can adamantly claim he gives a shit
about anything but Big Oil, but that doesn't make it true either.

Verant posted letters with CQ's permission.  I think this is about as close
to the 'whole story' as we're likely to get, and though I think Verant
overreacted I don't feel sorry for CQ at all.  They're claiming that they're
too stupid to know what's an exploit.  If that's the case, un-ban the two
people.  If they claim some intelligence, leave them banned.
