From the fact that you throw the request directly at them rather than
advertising it in the general chat channels provided. It goes from
giving a large number the opportunity to decide from themselves
whether they're too busy to even reply to making a single person feel
obligated to give a response. Beleive it or not, most people do have a
hard time saying "no" when pressured to respond.

No less reasonable than your beleif that it can't possibly be rude.

Nice dodge. How convenient, can't contradict a perfectly valid
analogy, so you just dismiss it by slapping the "strawman" label on
it. Tell me, what makes this a "strawman" besides the fact that you
have no solid rebuttal?

And yet you provide nothing to support your claim that they're not
comparable.

If someone else doesn't feel it's rude, that's their business. If I
feel you're being rude to me, you have no place to stand there and
bark at me that you're not being rude. If you don't think you're being
rude, fine. But you better damn well respond courtiously as you would
to someone you do beleive you're being rude to.

Oh, bullshit. In RL, shouting is not a "standard" means of
communication. You can't compare /ooc in-game to shouting IRL. It just
doesn't fly.

No, actually, I'm reading exactly what you said and removing your
spin-doctoring.

I'm not the one throwing the term "strawman" around as a bullshit
excuse to get out of responding to points I have no solid response
for.
