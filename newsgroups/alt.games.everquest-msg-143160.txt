Just wanted you to hear this:

After a nice day of leveling in DS and about to log off, a guildie told the
whole guild some guy was selling the Choker of Majjd for 50pp in the Bazaar.
Guildie already had the item and since it is Lore he can't buy it. So I
quickly ported to Nexus, ran to the bazaar and did a search on the choker.
My jaw dropped on the floor because he lowered the price to 25pp. OMG! I
felt so lucky at that time.

The item is worth over 1k, and if you are very lucky close to 2k. Because I
am a druid with see invis in my spellbook is don't really need it. But I
will hold on to it and maybe sell it for a nice profit later on.

So whats your deal of the century?
