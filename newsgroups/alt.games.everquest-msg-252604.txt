It's been about a year, but when we did it the xp was quite
decent for a mid to high 40's group.  In the tunnels where
we got the Torn Luggald Robe drop there's a L50 named who
drops a very nice priest weapon.  He's barely killable by
an untwinked mid-40's group, if you're not solid dealing
with the "trash" who have the Robe as a rare drop he may
wipe your group if he spawns.  The Tavern Wenches who drop
the other piece aren't too hard, but a skilled puller is a
great help (there's a "safe spot" along a wall in the street
near the tavern that's far enough from wandering mobs to
avoid aggro, easy to figure out if you spend a little time
scouting the area invisible).

We got a lot of mileage out of Dulak's Harbor, it was a
good xp zone for groups, with a reasonable supply of useable
loot and drops for worthwhile quests.  Some of what was
good about LoY on Stromm doesn't apply as much to an older
server where plat is easy to get and there's lots of stuff
for sale in the bazaar.  But LoY, and some older zones like
Kaesora in Kunark, Eastern Wastes and ToFS in Velious, and
even LDoN, give groups who'd rather gear up by questing and
dungeon diving alternatives to eqBay, er, I mean the bazaar.
