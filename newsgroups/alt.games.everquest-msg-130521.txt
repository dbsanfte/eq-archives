Oh my gawd.  I'm going to have to side with Michael Cargill on this one.
I'm not actually supposed to agree with him.

You do have rights, certainly.  However, there is no right to be free from
being offended.  You will be offended.  It's a part of life.  Deal with it
or die.  I am sick and tired of candy asses saying "I'm offended!" like it
means something.  So what if you're offended?  I'm offended that you'd put
your own ivory tower over anything that might offend you.  Your shit stinks
just as bad as anyone elses, so playing all high and mighty doesn't fly.

I hate to break this news to you, but if Cox drops it, then that doesn't
end it's existence.  What it will accomplish is that fewer people who are
actually offended (not you, you're a candy ass ostrich putting your head
in the sand) will see it and maybe do something about it.  I can't think
of one problem that was ever solved by people pretending it didn't exist.
Well, maybe the sitcom "Joanie Loves Chachi", but no other problems.

All evil needs to prevail is for good men to do nothing.  Offended people
are the kind of people who do something.  Therefore, offensiveness is a
tool for good.  If you aren't ever offended, then you will never do good.

By masking this problem, pretending it doesn't exist, and preserving
yourself from being (gasp!) offended, you'll never do anything about the
evil which offends you.  You find yourself motivated to do something,
and maybe something good, but your answer is to remove the motivation.
That's pitiful.  Sad.  No wonder there's an increasing evil in the world.
Good men shouldn't like to pretend that there's nothing worth fighting for.
