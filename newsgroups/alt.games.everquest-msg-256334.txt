    AE reduces the cost a significant amount more than MP (25% compared to
10%), but is limited to DoT-type spells of duration 30 seconds or more. So
it depends on what you cast as to which is better. My necromancer has AE and
loves it, as most of what she casts are DoTs with the odd Fear/Root/pet
haste. Note that you can have items with both on at the same time, and
whichever effect reduces mana cost more will be used. So if you had both on
and cast root, the MP item would fire, and if you followed that up with a
DoT, your AE item would apply to the DoT.
