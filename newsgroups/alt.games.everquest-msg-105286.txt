The number one reason is that you are not a Druid (a priest class),
you are a hybrid. You are 3/4 Melee and 1/4 Druid. The spells that
rangers get are a sub-set of the Druid line that make them better
fighters. At higher levels you will get some buffs that can be used on
other players, but that is not what your class is all about.
