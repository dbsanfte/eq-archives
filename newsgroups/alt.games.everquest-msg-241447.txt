I wish all groups thought this way, but there's way too many "Safer
than Sorry" kind of people out there who'd rather single pull a super
weak mob and beat it down than pull a group of super weak mobs.  This
has all come from the influx of newbies who did not grow up in dungeons
where multi pulls were necessary for success and Lull didn't work so
well after Kunark's release.  =/
