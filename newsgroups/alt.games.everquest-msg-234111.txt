I hadn't looked at the human monk stuff before, but it looks like the
top Qeynos headband (short of killing the guildmaster for his) is the
purple one:
 AC: +1 Dex: +1 Sta: +2 Cha: +2 Agi: +2 HP: +3
and the top reward in Freeport is the Red Sash of Order: 
 Dex: +1 Sta: +2 Cha: +2 Agi: +2 HP: +2
Even the black headband from the Qeynos GM isn't that great:
 AC: +2 Str: +2 Dex: +3 Sta: +4 Cha: +4 Int: +1 HP: +4

So yeah, I can see where you wouldn't mind losing those, but the Shackle
of Tynnonium looks pretty nice (at least to my current level of 24 :-)
 AC: +12 Str: +10 Sta: +10 Agi: +10 Magic Resist: +10 HP: +25
and the Shackle of Steel that precedes it isn't bad either:
 AC: +9 Str: +5 Sta: +5 Magic Resist: +5
I can imagine finding something better than the Steel for my other wrist,
but for now I think I'd like to keep the option of having one, so I guess
I'm doing the shackle quests three times.

(The earlier poster was right: the penance quest to get a fresh newbie
shackle isn't too bad; just tedious.  Take a delay-60 2HB down to LOIO or
FOB and whomp on skellies (or anything else where I can just turn on
autoattack and not have to worry about it running away) until it procs 56
times.  Or 112 times, since I'm doing it twice.  Something to do while I
read a.g.e in another window. :-)
