Sure, your point is valid... but the thing is, someone can complain
about the degree to which, in order to get some reward, they
are "forced" to suffer boring parts.

Given that we can't expect every moment to be exciting and fun,
and that we can't expect every moment to be sheer drudgery,
the topic of what the mix of each "should" be is a valid one to discuss.

I think there are, in many cases, in game solutions to many of the
"too much waiting" problems.  Meditation, for example, is something
I've found need be done only in moderation, with good planning
and tactics.  If you insist on taking on fights you can barely handle,
by using all your available mana and HP, then yes, you are in
for long stretches of sitting down.  There is a call for that kind
of fight from time to time, but generally it means too much boredom
in the boredom to excitement ratio.  It also rarely yeilds more
experience per hour than a more controlled fight sequence where
you can continuously pull fresh prey when the last dies.

Travel takes too long?  Spend cash for ports, use the firepots, or
make a game plan which involves travelling relatively short
distances for your next hunt.  Also consider either grouping with
or becoming a porter/sower/selo singer.

Foraging for that mudroot for your epic taking too long?  Have
friends make twinks and power level them, MT is a fun place
to go 1 to 10 in short order.  Really, though, this is one of the
more annoying "features" of the game, interminable waits in
areas that are rediculous for you to be in, hoping to pick up a
random rare spawn mob or forage or item.    Why would a
druid want to spend 42 RL hours sitting in Misty Thicket while
in her 40s?

I'm sure there are plenty of other waits out there that would
bear some scrutiny, those are just off the top of my head.
