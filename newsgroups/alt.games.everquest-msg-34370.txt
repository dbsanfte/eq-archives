The nature of the game has changed if that is the right term. Originally the
target market was assumed to be adults/mature.

As far as user base goes, this was 2 years ago and I have no way of telling
if the person was misrepresenting themselves. I was told ~"I'm a 9 year old
girl"  by someone I was grouped with. That the original Honeybugger story
was inappropriate for the user base was not my call<assuming it was
changed>, VI's decision. I'll second guess them  on things like spell damage
or factions, but I won't question their decisions of this nature.
