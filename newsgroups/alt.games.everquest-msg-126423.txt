I think you are failing to see what I meant in my post. I can *see* that 
Sanjian has exhibited restraint and respect in all his posts (although I may 
feel like arguing with some of the logic), that's why this thread continues.  
As far as I can tell, there hasn't been an uncivil word between any of the 
posters yet.

Sorry if I wasn't clear enough, but I never meant my post to refer to 
Mormons in particular. Sanjian said that a person's religion (and I took it 
to mean *any* person, not Mormons) is off-limits for criticism since it's so 
important to them. My counter-argument is that when it's so important to 
them that it compels them to discriminate against, oppress or even kill 
others, above whatever their innate sense of morality may tell them, then 
it's a bad thing.

Agnosticism has nothing to do with it, really. I may or may not be an 
agnostic, but it's religion (religion taken to extremes, in particular), not 
belief, that I have a problem with.
