*THAT* is exactly why I asked here. Figured someone could give me a
more likely reason. The only reason I could think of at the moment was
my access (which was fine regarding everything but Sony) or hacked in
some way.

And seriously, could an employee actually flip a switch and turn it
all off?!

Well since my particular server wasn't all that busy (like 3 people on
that I saw at last /who) it didn't occur to me that 10k people would
be trying to log into the website.

Again, that's why I asked here.
