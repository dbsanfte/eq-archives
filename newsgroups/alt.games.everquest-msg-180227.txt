Well if you want to discount Carnage at 40 ATK then you had better discount
FoN at 15.  I don't know any Rangers that cast FoN ever but hey feel free
to believe they do.

I bet they use Primal bow until it procs though - at least if they have a
clue they will.  Feel free to insert some uber uber uber guild disclaimer
about the soft ATK cap here though if it massages your ego sufficiently.

Bih'li stacks with Avatar now - the fact that it didn't originally was the
usual SoE bullshit stacking fuck up.

Anyone that asks gets two stacks of peridots before any raid in my guild.

Even though Ferine AND Ferocity on their own buff more than SoP and SoT
***combined***?

Oh and the HP difference between SoT and BSS is really quite large now so
you'll find many preferring that instead so you're down to SoP alone that
ALL the melees will take.
