Great post Lance!! Good info.

It brought up a question that's been bugging me for a while though. Recently
I dusted off my cleric and have gotten him up to level 42. What is your (or
other clerics out there) standard spell setup? I usually have 3 heals up
(Complete, Celestial, Superior), the 2 Divine's, Root, Stun, and a swop out
slot. How do you find room for 3 stuns? I could probably loose one of the
Divine's (not sure though, nice protection with the long recast times).
Anyway, I'm just interested in what other clerics keep memmed and such.

Thanks,
Naphtoe
