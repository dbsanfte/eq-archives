People who read above the "sound out each word" level read complete
words.  Something like "ur" where you meant "you're" slows down
reading speed significantly.

You write each post once, but thousands read each one (or try to).
The extra time it would take you to type out "you're" and "didn't"
will be much less than the time saved by the people reading your post.
