Love that idea=) Would be a nice change to have to fight out instead of 
in. Maybe they could make the hostage rescues a fight your way back out?

And I wish they had moved the locations around, one perhaps on each land 
mass [antonica, velius, odus, kunark] and a second one on antonica 
because it is so big. Would have been nice to see a theme going on, ice 
in velius and one in lavastorm for fire...odus could have been water, 
earth could have been in oasis/ro but not sure about kinark...
