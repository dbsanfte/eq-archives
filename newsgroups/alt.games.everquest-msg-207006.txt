Hope it's not an Assling, twink Assling Rangers (ie: all of them)
made the Glade cry.

Keep the Shissar and swap in a Goranga Idol for when you want useful
stats.  You could spend some coin on a better bow (ie any of those
from Dragon Necropolis) but at your level it'll do marginally more
damage than using harsh language on mobs plus they don't have any
stats.

Fleeting Quiver gives 20% arrow haste which stacks with EVERYTHING.
Displayed quiver weight reduction / 3 = arrow haste is the formula if
you want to get one of the cheaper ones.

Range ATK is never shown.  Keeping Archery maxed for each level will
be challenge enough without bothering about hidden ATK values.

ATK buffs help Archery, Haste buffs are a HUGE help with Archery,
Agi does nothing for Archery, Dex helps a little.

You sometimes see what appears to be double hits due to server lag
but it's an illusion - Archery seems much more susceptible to poor
server conditions due to the fact you have to keep prodding range
attack manually.

Without AA Rangers only get crits with Archery, Warriors also get
crits with Archery without any AA so no difference.  You won't see
any difference between the two Archery damage output wise until the
Ranger is much older (level 51 I think, been a while) and the double
damage bonus kicks in.  The gap widens situationally when you get
Trueshot, Archery Mastery and Endless Quiver but that's, uh, a long
long way away.

This won't be an issue for you pre-51.   Suffice to say keep
everything snared and/or rooted as it won't initially hurt your
Archery damage and will save you a crapload of HPs/deaths in the long
run.

Depends on gear but Rangers get a lot of options that allow then to
tank better (sic) than a Rogue where the definition of tank is
loosely defined as "kill the mob before it kills you".    

>rogues don't get an ac penalty though, right?

No, Rogues actually get quite decent defence and defensive ability
caps so they have a slight edge on Rangers in that regard.
