OK,  everyone feel free to correct this.

1.  You can raise Bard stuff by killing things in Mistmoor (yech)  This 
will allow you to get faction up high enough to do the letter quests.

2.  You can raise N Freeport faction by killing DF Orcs in the commons and 
turning in belts.  But first...

3.  If you kill bandits in the Karanas, you can raise HH and Qeynos 
(good/rogue) factions.  This may allow you to then collect gnoll/orc scalps 
to turn in at HH and raise FP and Qeynos "evil" factions AND FP merchant 
faction.  You can also kill gnolls in Blackburrow to raise Qeynos 
(good/merchant) factions.

Not easy but it can be done.
