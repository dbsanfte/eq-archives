Its also singing based, so holding your epic or using amplification will
increase the mana output per pulse.

Telling anyone this, however, should be grounds for immediate dismissal from the
bardic union, since its SOOOO much easier to just put up Soothing and give your
wrists a little rest, HP and mana regen both and its hands off!

OK, for Best mana regen without epic, its soothing amp clarity clarity soothing
clarity clarity clarity soothing clarity clarity clarity repeat.  You may be
able to slip even more clarities in there, but the point is to never let
soothing or amplification slip (except that amp can be down while you are
singing soothing or amp)

At least you can keep a string instrument in hand the whole time with this plan.

With epic, you can drop the amps and go soothing clarity clarity clarity repeat,
but now you need to worry about juggling string instrument in with epic, unless
your string instrument has worse bonus than your epic.

This works because soothing does stack with clarity, and amplification has a
much longer duration than normal songs, and clarity, as noted, can be force sung
to get more pulses per minute.

Don't tell anyone, though, just do it when you are so impatient for more mana
that you are willing to give up any hint of a down time whatsoever
