It's amazing how easy it is to consume vast amounts of bandwidth.  Take, for
example, Legacy of Steel's web site.  They have *no* general purpose EQ
information there.  All they have on the front page is screenshots of the
latest ubermobs they have killed, loot, and Tigole's rants (which are pretty
good...amusing, and often quite insightful).  They were using 6 gigs a day
of bandwidth, which was quite a bit more unlimited than their "unlimited"
provider was willing to provide.  That's why they were down a while
back...they were arranging more bandwidth, and redoing the front page design
to use less bandwidth.

The web population has grown way faster than bandwidth costs have come down,
and on the internet everyone is your neighbor, so web site costs have gone
up.
