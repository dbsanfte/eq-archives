Specific big quest targets are often either 'turn in something to spawn 
X' or instanced (enter a battleground, they call it).  In the case of 
instanced areas, there's almost always a level cap in effect as well "I 
know you are level 70, but we're making you effectively level 20 for the 
coming fight. Better have your level 20 equipment on." This lets the 
uber crowd help out their peon linkshell members without overwhelming 
the encounters. Think if, upon entering Vox's lair, you had to accept a 
debuff that lowers you to level 52 (or whatever the last level you can 
be before 'port away' takes effect).
The major difference in normal killstealing is that once someone tags a 
target, noone can touch it, much like EQ2 is doing.  (except you can 
still help out by casting cures or buffing the other player)

If something is engaged, my nukes won't land (if I was already casting 
when someone provokes the spell will go off and I'll get an invalid 
target. if I start casting after someone has engaged, it won't even 
start, just says 'invalid target' like I was trying to nuke a PC.)
