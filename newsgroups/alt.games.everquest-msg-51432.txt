    No, I can't.  Does DAoC _really_ work like this?  And what 
about armor?  It goes from 16 ac to 0 when you ding?  I wonder
if the game has stat/mana boosting items...would the effect on
those last after you  outgrew the item?
    Everquest is the first MMORPG I've ever played, and I'm not
sick of it by a long shot.  I'm just curious about the other 
ones out there.  I have absolutely _no_ interest in playing 
PvP, which most of the other games seem to feature, so I doubt
that I'll be leaving anytime in the future.
