I tend to agree that a consignment shop approach may flood

Yes, even without 24/7 Internet access, you can get great
deals on discounted wares in The Bazaar.

I think we end up with:

1. 24/7 Internet access users who can buy discounted wares in
   The Bazaar.

2. 24/7 Internet access users who can make a substantial amount
   of platinum selling wares in The Bazaar.

3. Non-24/7 Internet access users who can buy discounted wares in
   The Bazaar.

4. Non-24/7 Internet access users who can occassionally make a
   little platinum in The Bazaar.

Keeping in mind that I tend to agree that an uncontrolled and
unlimited consignment shop approach would tend to lower prices
too much, I still see an out-of-game mechanic (your Internet
connection) affecting a game mechanic (your wealth) quite a bit.

I would think it would be desirable to avoid that kind of thing.

Do I have a solution?  No.  I guess non-24/7 people just have
to put up with it.  Sucks to be them, but at the same time, it's
still a little sad that 24/7 Internet people have been handed
bags of platinum.
