COOKING AND PLATES

What do plates have to do with cooking? Well, on special occasions you
use your beautiful set to enhance your meal visually, you might add
candles and wine and that's the best you can do right?

If you check the Internet for "cooking" you will find out that it is
amazing how many schools and information there is on the subject,
however...It does not matter how much you studied, if you are THE BEST
CHEF IN THE WORLD or how much you spent on the ingredients, the candles
and the wine or even how long it took you to prepare that special
recipe or dish, if 5 minutes after serving it, it is going to start
getting cold.

Do you know that HEAT RETENTIVE PLATES have a delay action so that the
heat "kicks in" when needed and compensate for the heat losses of your
food without overheating it?

Do you know that heat retentive plates need JUST ONE MINUTE preheating
time?

Do you know that in lab tests with just ONE minute preheating heat
retentive plates stay hot for 30 minutes? (45 minutes if you preheat
them for 1:15 minutes).

Do you know that you can handle heat retentive plates by the rim which
remains cool for easy handling?

The plates can be made as elegant as any plate in the market, however
they were designed for daily use at home since their use is so simple:

"Just preheat ONE minute and serve your food as usual"

Remember:
You can simply handle them by the rim which remains cool

COOKING IS FUN, but enjoying what you cook is the best part of COOKING!
