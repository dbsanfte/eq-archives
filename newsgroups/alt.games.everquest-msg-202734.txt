And just to add a tad more about a KEI'ed wizzy on overburn or cleric going
nutty with the heals due to KEI.

LoL !. What they get to enjoy Kei for oh 5 or 6 minutes maybe.
As if any pure mana caster could go all out in fights without getting
stomped.

What did KEI do ? Eliminated a lot of silly boring downtime.
Got groups into zones that were byog. Did having KEI for everyone hurt any
one. Nope.
I have only seen people having fun with it. But oh this is work not a game
so lets make sure everyone is challenged by downtime. As if downtime has any
form of challenge to it. Other than everyone taking 10 minutes to go for a
beer, smoke, afk, scan web pages etc. KEI eliminated that.
Agreed it had the seldom and rare problem of some players leaving a group to
refresh KEI. But same as folks needing SoW or running to bank all the time
they get booted and replaced.

Every *****NERF***** done in the game has never ever been called a nerf by
Sony.
Always called a fix , balancing, adjustment or whatever...
But if it feels like a nerf. Looks like a nerf. Walks like a nerf.. hmmm
Well I calls em the ways I sees em
It was a NERF /shrug. play don't play whatever but it wasn't the first nerf
and won't be the last.
