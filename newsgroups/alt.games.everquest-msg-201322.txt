The basic is on sale most places for $9.99us, the gold box that I have seen
is everything up to PoP and was $49.99us last time I saw it. If you like the
game you will want to end up with at least that last one. Since PoP makes
moving around SO much easier.

Lots of people play on 56k modems, but I have never tried this. Always has
ISDN or better.

This is something everyone will answer different. Personally I have played
Mage, Necro, and Shaman as soloists. Had no trouble soloing all these
classes into the 50's.

Allakazam's is good, but search for everquest and read some of them. There
are class specific sites as well.

Warning, it can eat up alot of free time. Even if you aren't in a high level
raiding guild.
