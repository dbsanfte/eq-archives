On 04 Mar 2002 03:46:33 GMT, nefaria@aol.com (Feloni Mayhem) (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

My ranger pulled with the low level DD spells back then. Pulling with
snare isn't *wrong*, but its not particularly skillful either, sort of
a newbie move. Speed is what you want. You can snare them when they
get to your party.

As for the range, its not particularly important. Anything you can get
with arrows you can get with a spell within two seconds anyways.
