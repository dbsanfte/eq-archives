According to the history of the spell:

12-10 23:35 Removed Slot 8: Increase ATK by 0 
12-07 02:06 Added Slot 8: Increase ATK by 0  

They add the Increase ATK (presumingly the caster) on 12-07 suggesting
the spell never increased your ATK in the first place, and 3 days
later removed it so the spell has no attribute that increases your own
ATK rating. No idea why. Maybe the spell was meant to be just a STR
debuff?
