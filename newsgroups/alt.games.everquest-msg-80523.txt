You can't get Tiny daggers in Qeynos. (You apparently know this, but someone
out there in this world posted on Castersrealm that you could...) You have
to head back to Erudin, second floor of the palace if I remember correctly,
enchanter guild (The yellow one, nice of them to colour code it... ;o)). One
of the merchants in the middle of the room sells them. APPARETNLY there is
someone in Toxx forest that sells them as well, but I have yet to find that
person.

Also, remember that the Qeynos guild is made by humans, and probably
agnostic or other diety worshipping humans. (Ie not Prexus) therefore they
will not be too keen on you. So, yes, casting Illusion Human, and perhaps
also Alliance, will give you better prices and the ability to train. :o)

Solitude Dawn, who has a 9th level Human enchanter.
