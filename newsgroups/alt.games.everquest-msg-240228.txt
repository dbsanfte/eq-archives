I am with DT on this one(I think, I'm not sure he's expressing himself 
well)

The plat does not exist in any sense until you "earn" it in game, at which 
point the counter increments and you get loot. The legal problem here is 
that you don't own it. You don't own your character, you don't own your 
account. Ergo, you cannot sell or transfer it to another party. 

If people would read things before clicking "I agree" there would not be a 
20 post thread hee today.
