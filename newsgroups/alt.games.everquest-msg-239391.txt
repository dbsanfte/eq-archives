Go to www.eqtraders.com, read their guide to learning alchemy, browse their 
forums for th new GoD potions that are fairly cheap, and take a look at the 
great tables they have that show cost of creating potions.  The costs are 
out of date, and are actually high I believe, but, the decrease in cost was 
pretty much across the board.  It's been way too long to remember exactly 
what route I followed, but, basically, I found the next cheapest potion to 
make that was not trivial, and made it until it trivialed.
