Don't let bizbee get to you, instead feel sorry for him.  People with closed
minds like his aren't cut for this type of virtual setting anyway, and
they'll never get it and just lash out the people who *do* get it.   He's a
bitter old timer who will be left by the wayside when the future passes by
and the beauty of it is, he' can't even see it. heh
