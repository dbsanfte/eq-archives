It couldn't have been a ripoff of DS9, as both were released
about the same time and had obviously spent substantial time in
development.

I don't even think the two shows struck me as all that terribly
similar.

Rather, it was the marketing flacks behind Bab5 who were cramming
it down my throat in ways that made the two sound more similar
than they were... plus I think (but this is all fuzzy memory)
that they were actually run against each other in my area,
competing for the time slot.

I'd have preferred to like DS9, in the end I didn't give B5 all
that good a chance yet ended up not liking DS9 much either, gave
up on it after a season or so.

Neither came close to TNG for me, and I was dead set against TNG
when it came out, as blapheming the sacred original trek series. 
Plus the first season of TNG wasn't very good...

AH, the heady days when there were tons of things on and I was
fighting for the free time to watch them, instead of now when I
look over at the telly every now and then and decide I'd really
rather be playing a computer game.
