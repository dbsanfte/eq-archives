Argh.  Is anyone else annoyed by this article?

I already knew the media was full of sensationalist idiots, but a page
that calls itself New Scientist? *gnash teeth*

I'll say it one more time for my own ranting needs, then I'll try to
ignore these articles, because my idiot tolerance is low.  More men play
EQ than women.  The majority of men do not play transgendered characters
(though it might be 50/50...I already lost the link to the fellow who did
the polls).  Hence there are probaby more male ebay buyers. Hence there is
a greater market for male characters (if 50% wants only men, and 50% will
take either gender, that's still a larger market for male than for
female).

But no...it's MUCH more newsworthy if you can tell everyone that women are
being discriminated against, us poor lil' things, so oppressed by the
patriarchial system.  

I'm all for equality being spoken out for when it's needed,
but...argh!  ARGH I say.

...argh....

(And yeah yeah, although I've never played a male character, I suspect I
get offered help and unwanted suggestions more than males
do. Woopdie-fricking-doo...at this point I neither encourage nor
discourage it, since if someone just wants to feel helpful, it's not nice
to be nasty about it, and if they are looking for something in return,
that's not my problem...they'll go away eventually when I don't start
flirting.)
