I am a 65 cleric and have had run 3 since level 51, it has saved my life
many times.  Now, at 65 I have only 6 AA's to get my title. I find I
personally am a little wary to group with people in difficult area (like
LDoN groups and BoT) if they have no aa's. My aa's I got by level 61 and are
just for show really  so people are not wary of inviting me into their
group.

If nothing else get run 3 now! there is nothing worse than training to the
zone and having people run faster than you with a mob on your tail.
