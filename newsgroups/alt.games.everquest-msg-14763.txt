Rogue is about the worst class for soloing in the game. Poison will
never make a rogue an efficient soloer. Poison is good though. It's
great to have poison to use on a hard mob. It's also real nice in PvP
encounters. It's a special feeling to find some meditating lighty, and
shiv them real good and poison em at the same time.

To get components, try auctioning for them when you are in zones where
they drop. Chances are you will find some people willing to sell them.

Also, there is a personal satisfaction gained from carefully preparing
your special venom, and using it in a fight. It's very roguelly.
