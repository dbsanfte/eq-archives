In your area I cant help with where components are, but that is just
part of the game and something you have to deal with (the use of
components).  

What I can answer is the question of "Which class is best?"  The
answer is all of them and none of them.  Play what you LIKE.  What do
you envision yourself to be?  Dont worry about specifics and stats or
anything else, what do you WANT to be.  I am a fighter type.  I HAVE
to be in there duking it out.  It is just my style.  This makes me a
bad pure caster because I want to be in there with my dagger or staff
not standing on the hill casting Mez.  Think about what type you are.
From the sounds of it that MAY be a pure caster.  Just deal with the
problems or obsticles that you face.  I dont like not being able to
heal myself or TP, but I am not a druid just to get those things.
Being a druid would limit my style in other areas.

Good luck=)
