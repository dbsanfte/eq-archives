Are you asking me?  I can't tell because you didn't quote anything.  I have
a number of people in my KF, and news servers lose messages frequently
enough, that it is really not possible for me to tell if you are responding
to me, or possibly to someone who responded to me.

If you are asking me that, then, no, of course not, it is possible to
multiquest, and I am not aware of any rules that prohibit it.  It is not a
bug that allows it to happen.  Verant is fully aware that multiquesting
exists, and, in the case of quests where they do not wish for it to happen,
they have made sure that it cannot.
