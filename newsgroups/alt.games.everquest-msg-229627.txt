[NOTE: I'm top posting and bottom posting in this message to illustrate a
point]

Yes.  For this particular post, where you had exactly one point I'm
responding to, it is not too bad.  However, if you had multiple points that
I was responding to, this post would read much smoother to the reader if it
is in the form "[your point #1] [my answer #1] [your point #2] [my answer
#2] ...".

Second, if I want to leave in the quote that you respond to, if we both
top-post, it makes it even harder on the read.  They basically have to skip
down two quote levels, read a paragraph, skip up, read a paragraph, and then
read my response.

So, if I top-post in answer to your top-post, the reader is skipping all
over the place to figure out what the hell is going on.

Note that if I put my answer to you here, to make it more convenient to the
reader, then Darktyger's material you quoted is down below, which is very
confusing.

If I put my answer here, Darktyger's stuff is between yours and mine, which
also makes it harder for the reader.

Now, let's look at it as if you had bottom-posted:

I stick my response here, and it is easy for the reader to get as much
context as they need...they just start scanning down, skipping Darktyger's
quote if they recall it, or reading it if needed, flow through yours, and
are right into mine.  If you had multiple points, the post would read like a
conversation.

There's a reason that bottom-posting has been a strong convention on almost
all usenet groups for nearly 20 years.  It has been experimentally
determined to work best, and so most people will do it.

Worst of all is if a thread has mixed top-posting and bottom-posting.  It is
then a total mess for the reader.
