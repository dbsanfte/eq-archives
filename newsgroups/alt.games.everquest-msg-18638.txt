Crafted bracers are crap.

I wear a Ry'gorr bracer, 1 less AC but +2 str, +2 cha (good for a troll) and
+5 hp (not that noticeable)
and a bracer of Erollisi, 5 AC but a hefty +5 str (great for a halfling like
me)

If you have a banded/bronze cloak, look into a cloak of the ice bear, 8 AC,
+10 hp and a very nice +20 sv cold.  or the cloak from the Iceclad gnolls
that takes an MQ dire wolf fur (no drop i believe) and 2 skinning rocks, 7
AC and +5 str.

Get rid of the giant warrior helm, it isn't that good, get a skull-shaped
barbute, 13 AC +35 hp (very nice) and +10 sv magic (also nice)

Kind of a tossup on shoulders between a bloodstained mantle, 6 AC +3 str +10
sv magic or crafted pauldrons, 12 AC but only +2 str and +2 sv magic ( I
have both in case I need the extra save on bloodstained)

Crafted arms aren't as bad as bracer, but Ry'gorr is better in my opinion,
11 AC +3 agi +10 hp +5 sv cold and +3 sv magic.

You didn't mention what boots you have, but if its banded or bronze, I would
suggest getting some crafted boots, 12 AC +5 agi or going to icewell keep
and scavenging royal frosted velium boots, 19 AC +5 sv magic which I like a
lot better, other pieces of velium are probably better than what I've
suggested but the boots (at least on my server) seem to drop (and rot) a LOT
more than the other pieces.

If the 2 AC ring is all the stats on it, I would suggest a Jagged Band, 5 AC
and +3 str, drops in unrest somewhere.

If you have banded or bronze on your belt, get a straw-spun belt, 10 AC ( or
an FBSS =P )

I'm not sure of prices on any of this on your server, but on mine the cloak
of ice bear is about 50-100pp, bloodstained mantle is about 50, skull shaped
barbute ( regularly called SSB) goes for 75-100, Ry'gorr bracer is about
150, Ry'gorr arms about 200-250, Jagged bands 25-50 each, bracer of erollisi
25-50, Crafted boots 150-200, straw spun belt anywhere from 50-100pp to
given away with a "get this piece of crap offa me" attitude ( FBSS around
7-8kpp ), no idea on crafted pauldrons ( I quested mine).

Hope this helps a bit!
