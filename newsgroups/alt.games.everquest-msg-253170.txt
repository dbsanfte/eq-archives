Largely because nobody I have ever bumped into in eq has *ever* believed 
I was a "magical elf throwing lightning bolts", not even for a minute. 
They all assumed I  was an earthling human, every last one of them, I 
didn't even have to tell them.

I have never lied or even misled anyone in EQ about my RL self. I 
haven't told them I'm a girl, I haven't told them I'm dead, and I 
haven't told them I'm a magical elf ... not that they'd beleive that 
last one anyway.

Hmm, you seem to be confusing 'in character' and 'out of character'.
