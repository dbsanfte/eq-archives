For melee, my 33 Ranger uses a Wurmslayer and a swiftblade (haste 36%). I
easily out damage a lot of similar level warriors, shadow knights and
paladins. Paladins and shadow knights don't get dual wield and most warriors
are paying for their AC armour I suppose ;). Add to this damage shields,
Camouflage, SoW, Levitate (soon) and then Wolf Form and the picture you
paint really changes for the better. Archery can score nice damage later on
too.

There is also the ability to kite so you can solo animals quite easily and
Stonebrunt would be a good place for you atm.

Track will really be valuable to you when you start doing quests or go for
mobs with no-drop items. Also it is good for pulling, checking the imediate
danger of zones (sort by distance) and some people even pay you to track
mobs for them.

I think you are playing your character wrong. They are not tanks and you
have to play to the ranger's strengths - perhaps you should look for some
class guides and read them through so you get some idea of what to do.
