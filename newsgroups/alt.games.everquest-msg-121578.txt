If you seriously think your rights are violated, take the issue to court.
Or is this just idle government bashing without true basis?

As for Congress being the only entity that can violate your rights to free
speech, it isn't quite so.  I once knew a person who was almost fired for
writing to a newspaper with an opinion that was extremely controversial at
our workplace.  An employee had been killed elsewhere, and this particular
employee thought it was a case of law enforcement using excessive force.
The law determined the killing was justified, if unfortunate.  This one
employee disagreed.  I had no opinion on it, as it all happened before I
started working here.

Anyway, the employee wrote to the paper, and as I mentioned, was almost
fired.  He promised to sue if the termination was sustained, and in the end,
he was reinstated (by the manager's boss) with profuse apologies.  The
initial manager initially violated his right to free speech, with no help
from Congress, although it all worked out OK in the end.
