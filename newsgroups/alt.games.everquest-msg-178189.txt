I fell asleep in an XP group in Trak's lair. Died. Got a rez box. Woke
up shortly afterwards. Wound up alone with Trak, who had popped during
my brief nap. Didn't know how long I was asleep. Went to hit
sneak/hide. Hit attack first.

The first sign my group (which has retreated a little ways) sees is:
Moulin has scored a critical hit (18.) Then Moulin has been slain by
Trakanon.

I still hear from them about the night I tried to solo Trak naked and
with rez effects.
