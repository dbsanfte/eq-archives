Just a reality check, a lot of people get accused of poor raid etiquette,
druids don't own the market on it.  And try if you will to see that there is
a difference between what you do on a raid and what you do sitting at the
druid ring being annoyed by people asking for a sow or port.  Little
different scenario.

Actually I can because your taking my quote out of context, I was refering
to the relative difficulty of getting the groups left out of perma after the
druid left.  In regards to determining if changing a bind point is a minor
or major inconvenience I think I feel comfortable stating that I believe it
to be a minor one, but hey thats an opinion.
