So you're saying that after 200 INT that extra 10 INT is worth about 50
mana, at any LV?

And as for his post...I think it goes against almost every helpful guide
I've read to this point. He had no fact, only opinion. "It is this way
because it is, and it is because I say it is. You don't need a reason or
fact to believe me, it just is."

The only thing I can think of that I agree about is that Ogres are strong
tanks due to their highest starting STR ability, and also high STA.  But the
KOS part, and being so large (not good for tight places unless you spend
allot on shrink potions), and large armor is a little harder to find as
well.
