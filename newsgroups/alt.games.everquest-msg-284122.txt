Chorkie Glossary Question #2: "Cephaloe"? Probably related to latin for
head, as in cephalopod (squid family). I'm ancient, and well behind on my
slang.

Don't shoot the messenger, but the way you come across in your posts makes
me sometimes wonder you've forgotten the difference between a player being
team-oriented and a player doing what you tell them. Your husband pulls
and tanks. You pacify, and loot, and heal. You play together all the time,
and you're used to being the stars of the group. So it's only sensible
that other players should do what you tell them because you are the experts
at ldons and other folks should be unquestioningly happy with their
supporting roles. It's also within the realm of possibility that if you
come across this way in your typed posts on usenet, you could come across
that way in your typed chat in game. Maybe the necro and druid, rather
than being selfish, were looking to shine on their own merits, rather than
bask in your reflected glow. You said yourself you didn't think the necro's
nukes+dots and the druid's heals were worth much. Perhaps your attitude
came through. Just food for thought.
