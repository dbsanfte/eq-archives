That and the "narrow bandit infested pass" theory are <far> from
generally accepted.  The overwhelming majority of theologians I've
seen comment on this supposed contreversy believe that Jesus "said
what he meant and he meant what he said".  That is not the only place
you'll find Jesus using an extreme example to dramatize a point in
his teaching.  But go ahead, rationalize away your rejection of his
teaching all you like, it's not like I or anyone else in this world
can stop you.

I don't know you, except through your posts here, but the only
explanation I can come up with for that last statement (assuming
that you believe it to be true) is that you are blinded by your
pride and self-satisfaction.
