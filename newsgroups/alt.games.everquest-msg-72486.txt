Okay, where is this explained? Things like "+3 cold(/fire/whatever)
damage" on a weapon...that means an 8/20 weapon with that modifier
will be effectively an 11/20 weapon for every unresisted hit, right?

And then there's the "Recommended level xx" on some items...

The +xx% <skill> items...does that add xx% to the skill level (So +3%
tailoring makes 100 tailoring effectively 103, big whoop...200 would
become 206...)? Or does it add to the "skill roll" to improve the
chance of a success? (Or maybe it'd be the same either way...)

Back when the epic weapons for all classes were added, didn't VI say
that the monk epic was the gloves because they couldn't add a dam/dly
modifier to the hth skill on an item? Maybe a perk of the new engine?
(If that is the case, why couldn't they have made Quivers equippable
in the ammo slot while they were re-writing things? ;-) )
