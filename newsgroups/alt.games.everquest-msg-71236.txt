How does anyone else's planning or lack of have anything at all to
do with you, and why should you even care?  I really do not
understand why any here have ever been upset that some had an issue
with the win 95 computability thing.  If some person can't or won't
upgrade to a newer OS for whatever reason and they paid for a game
that states plainly that it works with win 95 but doesn't why does
any care if they get a refund?  If they have to threaten class
action to get it well so be it.  Myself I would not have done that,
but then again I have a quickly dying win 98 OS that I hope will be
good for another year at least so did not have that trouble.  I did
have to get a new video card as my old one would not work with the
new expansion.
