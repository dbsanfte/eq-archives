So in an attempt to hijack this thread a bit :)
Speaking of new UI, does anyone have a page of new nice skins for the new
UI?
Or know of any pages where avid skin creators are displaying their work for
perusal and download?

Now with it possibly being patched (barring any last minute bugs, like those
ever crop up :) on the 24:th it would be nice to have a skin to go with it,
since the default one doesn't really make any use whatsoever of what the new
UI can do.
