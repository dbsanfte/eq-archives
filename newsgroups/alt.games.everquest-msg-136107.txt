Normally I ignore anyone who uses the tired old misnomer ' homophobe '
but I'd like to respond to this.

First of all, the court ruling you refer to was a provincial decision which 
a] will be appealed to the supreme court of Canada, and b] will not
be applied in other provinces like Alberta who have declared they will
use the not withstanding clause in the constitution to over-ride it should
the supreme court declare the denial of same sex marriages to be 
unconstitutional. [ the supreme court of Canada being nothing more 
than a collection of Liberal appointed, Liberal hacks will no doubt support 
the lower court ruling ].

The auditor general report was to be kind, a pile of shit. Same sex marriages
will increase benefits paid from both government and the private sector, in 
the form of pension, survivor benefits etc., while reducing tax revenue as a
result of increased deductions in areas such as increased dependent 
exemptions.

From a strictly financial perspective of the state, unless you can enlighten 
me, I see no advantage to same sex marriages.

However, financial reasons should not be the sole determinant as to whether 
any legislation is passed. We know same sex marriages would advance
the political agenda of homosexuals both personally and collectively, but of
what benefit to the remaining 96% of the population can you offer ?
