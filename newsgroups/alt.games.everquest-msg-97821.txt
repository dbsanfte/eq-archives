I have noticed, in general, that F8 targeting has been less
reliable since the engine changes prior to Luclin (could be
a coincidence). However, F8 has never been super-reliable.
It can be affected by a variance in vertical position
between you and the mob/NPC (like being on a hill or small
rise or other non-flat terrain). Similarly, it can be
affected by a difference in height (i.e. a Barbarian can't
F8 target a gnome or lion, while a gnome can't F8 target
giants). Finally, F8 just seems to work better in some zones
than others. For example, I rarely have been able to get it
to work well in Howling Stones, but have found it quite
reliable in Lower Guk.
