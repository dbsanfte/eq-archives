It's not twinking if you buy it yourself with money you earn, only if you
are buying it with money earned by a higher level character. So don't think
of buying armor for your shaman as twinking.  Head to the bazaar and see
what's up there.  Things have come down in price a lot and you should be
able to find some stuff you can use at a reasonable price.  Also, a good
next step is Paludal Caverns where you can group for experience.  A lot of
Brigandine armor drops there and you can probably get a full suit by the
time you make level 18-20 in there.

You don't say what race you are, but if it's Barbarian be sure to hang on to
any Low. Medium, or High Quality Bear pelts you collect.  They will sell
well in the Bazaar.  Spider Silks as well.  The most money I ever made was
selling pelts.  I was so excited the first time I sold a bunch of pelts for
180pp!

Shamans are sort of a combination of warrior and caster.  At starting levels
you can melee about as well as other classes, but as you start to level, the
differences between the classes start to show up and shamans are not as
strong at meleeing anymore.  You will have to do sort of a combination of
DoTing, nuking and meleeing at this level.

Again, check the bazaar for weapons.  There are a lot of them that would be
an improvement on what you have that sell very cheaply.

Good luck.
