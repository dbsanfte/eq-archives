    The key only appears on your key ring once you've used it.

    In theory, you can destroy it - it won't leave the key ring. However, 
the more paranoid players realize that if there's a software glitch and key 
rings are erased, there's no way to prove what was on there except 
indirectly. I think I still have my VT key in the bank, even though I could 
have destroyed it ages ago (and really, if I could destroy it off the key 
ring I'd do that too).

    Hedge gives a flag, not a key. Flags don't show up on the key ring.
