My experiance with rangers is that at low levels they generate too much
freakin aggro. Every single level 45-50 something ranger I have ever had the
*pleasure* of grouping with always managed to get aggro. Sometimes they
snare way too early and sometimes they taunt for no reason but in general I
think its just that tank taunt of the same level just doesnt scale. After 55
and to 60 rangers get aggro much much less.
