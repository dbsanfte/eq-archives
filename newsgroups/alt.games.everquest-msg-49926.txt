AO was very buggy when it came out, and took a long time to get better
(if it did get better...a lot of people think it is still too buggy to
play).  DAoC is starting out less buggy than EQ.  At least up to level
10 (which is what my main character is now), it plays a lot like EQ
with a better interface, better mob AI, less bugs, a massively better
tradeskill system, and less downtime.
