I think you are wrong on all counts.  The key to being *wanted* in groups is
knowing how to play your class.  I've played with crappy beasties, paladins,
rangers, rogues, clerics, etc.  They didn't know how to play their characters,
they were lazy, they were AFK, they were ineffective, loud, overbearing, self
centered, I often wonder: powerleveled or ebayed, which is it?
I've also played with GREAT monks, paladins, rogues, druids, rangers etc.  They
knew how to adapt their playing style to fit the group.  They were always
attentive and at their post ready for action.  They make suggestions not
demands.  
If you are ill informed of how to play your character you are going to suck. 
If you watch, learn, read up, take advise, and contribute effectively you'll be
great at your class.
