Perhaps lazy was the wrong word. I, like everyone, also use
abbreviations. "Pls" would be a more correct abbreviation. "Plz", in
the context of EQ, is "d00d-speak" and therefore lumps you into that
category when you use it. Yes, being a "d00d" is a bad thing.

As I said, I believe that "prolly" is not an abbreviation in most
cases because I hear people *say* the word that way often enough. They
say it that way because of poor diction skills. "Prb", makes sense as
an abbreviation for "probably". It is significantly shorter and still
conveys it's correct meaning within context. "Prolly" is just poor
verbage any way you look at it.
