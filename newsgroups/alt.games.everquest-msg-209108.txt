Really?
I am surprised. The Ubisoft Euroservers seem to hold slots 2, 3 and 4 in the
most populated list (with Stromm number 1 and Brislebane/Karana swapping
places for 5/6)  Is the population counter not working on those servers?
Even FV gets into the high 400's, albeit evenings at the weekends only, for
traders and that's 1 character per account.
