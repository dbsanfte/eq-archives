I just don't get this attitude at all. Look, you PAID the money, if you 
don't like it, you have EVERY FREAKIN' RIGHT to bitch about it and warn 
others not to pay THEIR money for it. I mean, that's what consumers DO. We 
protect each other by telling our experiences to other consumers. Sure, 
there's a lot to like in EQ, but not complaining about the stuff that isn't 
right is not going to help it get made right. Might makes right. Or 
something. I'll just shut up now.

but the laughter of would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt, turn me inside out
