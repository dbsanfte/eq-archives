Well, I'd think that is pretty much what Feander meant.  I mean, I
doubt he'd ignore the casters' if the mana was going well, but when
push comes to shove, I keep the tank alive, and let the others sort

Lol, true.  Seriously, Celestial Healing potions are cheap, and
provide a very good heal (every couple of minutes) and it takes the
load off the cleric in a crisis.  I usually have at least 12 in my
inventory, for emergencies.  They're so cheap now I usually pack along
some Clarity, Skinspike and Alacrity potions, too.
