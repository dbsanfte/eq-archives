So we got our UK CE of EQ2 today, on my partners birthday!
and we got one free, we weren't billed for it or anything (compensation I
think for receiving it 4 days after UK release).
But I created two Chars, decided to try out tradeskills, first char's
artisaning zone was broken so I took the other one and tried with her. I
tried to get through the citizen quest with her for about 5 hours today.
either the zone would be down or the zones would refuse to load or
everything would go screwy or my password wasn't accepted or the login
server wasn't responding or I got chucked out due to Lag or etc....
I did it though, I managed to finish it right now. I went to the enter
village gate to go back to my village and when it didn't load after 30 secs
of clicking I went on to Quenos which eventually did load (I was hoping to
get to baubbleshires artisaning place) so I was running through Quenos
harbour and it loads me outta the zone then freezes and then wont let me
back into the game. BTW this wasn't my puter as it was tried on both of our
puters (unless it was both).
I think I will leave it there for tonight and go to bed. I will see if the
game still hates me in the morning.
Ceri :o)
