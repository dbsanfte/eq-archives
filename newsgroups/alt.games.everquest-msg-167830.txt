ok, friend in guild wants item X. knows I have long time bazaar mule, so
while I am on he asks me every 20 min what the price on X is. (never more
than one or two available, ranging in the 4k area.. sometimes as high as 5k,
seen as low as 3750. differing merchants (I try to track that as well))

He finally gets item X at bargin basement price of 3.5k
2 days after he gets it, I loot item X. As I don't need item X, I take it to
bazaar and place it on mule. I check my price point with /bazaar.

item X is available from 6+ people, prices in the 1k-2k range.
/grumble
place Item X up at 1300pp just because I'm annoyed.

/fastforward 2 days, no sale made
/bazaar
item X is for sale, 3 of them besides mine, on different merchants than last
I looked (wrote em down). 400pp, 500pp, 750pp.

/scream
------
And then, I finally master a tradeskill. been watching the price of an item
crafted with that tradeskill. they sell rapidly @ 1500pp or there abouts.
price to craft approximately 400pp, not trivial at 255 so you get some
failures (say 2 successes in 3)
I make 4 (7 attempts, 2800pp invested).
place on mule for 1500, no others for sale.
a couple of hours later, get a tell about 'will you match the other guys
price?'
/bazaar
guy with 27!!! of them. for 450pp each.
and he's been restocking every time he sells out.
for 2 weeks.
my price is down to 650 in the hope I'll get either a pity sale or he'll be
out when someone needs them. At that price I will still lose money.
All other items in my profession have bottomed out and are generally not
worth the effort to go make... 15pp profit for a 180pp cost item, I can make
money faster farming spider silks... though I imagine if I farm some of them
they will drop to 1sp a piece...
Why me
/rant of wallowing in my self pity off. Thank you for your attention.
