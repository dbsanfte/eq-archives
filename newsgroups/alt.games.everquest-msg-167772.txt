Hard one to beat there... but I have to at least attempt.

Maybe a Douglas Adams homage? That unfinished book they found on his hard
drive titled "Salmon of Doubt" which is a play on the "Trout of Knowledge"
in Celtic mythology opens up a whole slew of possibilities, especially if
you consider what other booby prizes may have awaited our heroic Celtic
fishermen:

"Mullet of Sobriety"
"Groper of Famial Relations"
"Whiting of Racial Tolerance"
"Fugu of Longevity"
"Flounder of Balance"
"Blue Whale of Enviromental Respect"

....and the perrenial favourite:

"Shrimp of Endowment"
