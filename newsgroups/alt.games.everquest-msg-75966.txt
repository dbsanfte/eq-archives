I've posted another thread on this, however in case you missed it. The 
game states that you get 10 days trial but once playing indicates 14 
days.

Also it indicates you will be restricted to PC Zone servers however 
again once you play you find all the servers are available.

It is the latest version with regard to the interface, however talking 
to a friend who plays EQ we believe that the player skins are the old 
ones - which aren't too bad. It does not contain any of the add ons. I'm 
going to play for the next week, if I like it i'll import the trilogy 
before the offer runs out. From what I can see, it will not be necessary 
to buy any additional software, if you don't mind staying in the non-add 
on lands. But if you do then I guess the Trilogy is the best option, or 
possibly we could wait to see what the UK distributor does.
