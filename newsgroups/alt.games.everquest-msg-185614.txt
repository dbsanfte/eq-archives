You have only 1k hp at level 54, buffed?  I'd recommend you start looking
for HP/AC items.

My enchanter is 61, just as a point of reference.

Feel free to dump CHA.  I mean, I wouldn't go below 120 unbuffed, but if you
get a chance to swap HP for AC at the cost of some CHA, go for it!

Long ago I dumped my INT rings for velium fire opal rings (AC6/HP65).  It
lowered my INT to below 200 but with your C2, ToT and WM (or the new one if
you've done that quest yet) mana really shouldn't be a problem.

I've still got a ways to go...my buffed (with virtue and self-buffs) are
only 3300 and AC at best about 750, but I'm slowly working on it. :)  For me
the trick is to improve those while also improving my resists so I have to
carry fewer items in my resist kit. :p
