Funny, it worked fine before the Luclin patch...

I don't so much mind the gamma bar slider working, but what I do mind
is that they *reset* the video card's gamma when they start
the game.  If they didn't, I could use the card's own Windows-level
gamma setting to crank up the brightness, then run EQ and do
fine-tuning via my monitor's brightness controls.  (I used to
do that on an older computer with other games.) 

Now, however, I'm screwed, since EQ sets the video 
card's gamma back to its factory level when it starts up.
Or at least it did a few days ago, I need to double-check
that again now, perhaps the last few patches have that
covered.
