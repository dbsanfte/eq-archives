There is a haste cap.  It is 80% (or is it 85%) from 51 to 59, and 105% at 
60.  I think it's lower below 51.  
There are 3 types of haste:  item haste, song/spell haste, overhaste.  An 
item with a permanant haste effect is item haste.  A haste spell or 
bardsong is a song/spell haste.  Some items have procs or right-click 
hastes, these are also song/spell hastes.  
Bards post-50 get two lines of overhastes which stack with song/spell and 
item haste, the ervaj line and the Vah Shir line.  The Ervaj line is 5% 
and 10% haste that stacks with the other two hastes, and can bring you to 
the haste cap.  The Vah Shir line is 15% and 25% haste that stacks with 
song/spell haste and item haste, and can brind you OVER the haste cap.  As 
far as the bard community knows Ervaj and Vah Shir hastes do not stack 
with each other.
The maximum haste that a level 60 can acheive is 130% (70% spell haste, 
41% item haste for 111%, but knocked down to 105% by the cap, then the 25% 
Warcry of the Vah Shir.
