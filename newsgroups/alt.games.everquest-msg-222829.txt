I realize you're not complaining, so this message is more of a supplemental
comment than a response to your post. For the record, this lurker not only
enjoys reading Lance's explanatory posts, but very much appreciates the
approach he takes in assuming that there is generally a wider audience
interested in the answer than just the original poster and therefore
provides more context and less assumed knowledge. Those who wish to avoid
reading the lengthy posts always have that option: unfortunately, the
opposite is not true.
