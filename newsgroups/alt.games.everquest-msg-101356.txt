Let's assume they are hiring noone, and taking it all in as additional
profit.  So what?  They are in business to make money.  That's the purpose
of the business in the first place.  So long as I, the player, feel that the
price I am paying is an acceptable price for the service they are providing,
we will both be happy.  Personally, even at $12.95/month, I will continue to
be happy.
