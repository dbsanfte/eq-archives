  I stopped bothering to spamblock my email address a while ago.  Spam
doesn't really bother me.  It takes me about one second to hit "delete" and
get rid of the junk.  I'd rather not "confuse" any newsgroup newbies out
there who try to email me by keeping my email address accurate.  As a side
note, I don't get a lot of spam either, especially not of the "sex and
schemes" variety, but I think that has to do in part with spamblocking
measures my ISP has taken... I don't know for sure.  I do know that they do
a good job of keeping the spam off their news servers, because I never see
any spam in the newsgroup, unless somebody replies to it.
