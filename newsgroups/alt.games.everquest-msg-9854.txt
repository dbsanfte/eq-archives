A friend of ours used to do homebrewing, but was forced to stop because the
medication he's one doesn't react well to alcohol.   But before he had to
stop, a bunch of us helped him start a batch of mead.

It sat in a carboy in his house for a bit over 2 years before his wife put
her foot down and said to either bottle it or pour it out.  We had no idea
how it would turn out.

And how it turned out was wonderful.  It's some of the best mead I've ever
had.  Pissed my wife off, because the week we bottled it was the week she
found out she was pregnant, so she couldn't have any.  But I have a bottle
stashed for her for after the kid arrives.
