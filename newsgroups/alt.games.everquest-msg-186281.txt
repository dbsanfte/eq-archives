Killing Barducks Darkpaw triggers the war, he'll shout something to
the zone on his death and you have about five minutes to get out of
the caves and back to the settlement before any Gnolls arrive.  No
faction hits at all, the NPCs will defend themselves (some of them
anyway, at least one of the guards turns into a quivering wreck as he
sees others get ganked) but the Gnolls WILL wipe the settlement
without a fair bit of help.

If you turn the tide and kill all the Gnoll Assassins that eventually
attack you get little pieces of loot off each to turn in for
"rewards", we got a potion that had a single charge of Fungal
Regrowth and similar items.
