If it's excitement you're looking for, I'd suggest trying Unrest. It's an
old-world zone, but the XP is pretty good... and it gets -extremely-
exciting when you're trying to manage a pull of 5 mobs. Undead zone, too, so
that would be a nice advantage for you, since you're a necromancer. Two best
classes for this zone, IMHO, are Necromancer and Enchanter (Torklar
Battlemaster, a mob who spawns there, hits for around 50-80 damage a pop,
and has low enough magic resist that you can usually tash him and charm him
when he's busy with someone else, though I'd suggest you root him, too.)

-Vsove, Level 19 Enchanter.
