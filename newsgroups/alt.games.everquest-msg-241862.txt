Where has Google proven this?  In your browser perhaps ... do you wear
glasses?

If you knew anything about this particular group you would know that
TomG is the pre-eminent poster at all times.  He will always be top of
the posting list unless he is hospitalised or on holidays and I haven't
seen him in either of these states in the years I have been on this
group.

Your stats are proven to be not worth the ether they were written on
they gave no source at all (dates times posters etc).

The newsgroup should be aware you have been proven to be a liar now.
You have not been through my list and come back with "oh this person
posted as a bottom/context poster in 2001" yet.

You are now foundering around looking for a way out of your
predicament.  I have proven you to be the liar, in this particular
case, and the best you can come up with is vapour.

You live in cloud cuckoo land obviously Mr Sisson and since you always
have to have the last word I expect you will reply to this.

I do not expect an apology from you ... since your foul mouth so
obviously can't utter one (none of those from you on Google that I can
see).

I am now leaving this topic alone  (collective sigh of relief from
all).  Thank you Remington Stone for answering my question.
