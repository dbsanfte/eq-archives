I started a monk a couple of days ago.  He's up to level 12 now and I was
just wondering if there's any reason to practice skills like Kick and Round
Kick.  I think Kick got all the way up to about (4) skill before I got Round
Kick, and that one didn't get much higher before Tiger Claw.  Looking at
Casters Realm I see I will eventually get Flying Kick at 30, is there any
reason at all to use the other abilities after I get that one?
