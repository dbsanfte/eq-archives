Of course, some of those 65's may have been around so long they've seen
those zones and more with the other 5 alt's they've leveled up once they
hit max level.

My experience has been that the "have to be 65 to be cool" (formerly
have to be 50, have to be 60)" has been as much a phenomena of the
green-eyed newbie as the high level in question.
