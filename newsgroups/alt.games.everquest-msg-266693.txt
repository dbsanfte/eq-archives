I'm not quite sure why Amazon UK should care that SOE is having trouble
getting the CE edition through US customs but I will vaguely accept it.
Thanks for trying to help, Partner has just gone out to pick it up from
Game. Amazon still have the 15th marked for delivery but they now have an
availability of "dispatched normally within 24 hours" so we will wait for
amazon as well (still really want those cloth maps) I wonder if the reason
Mark got his and we didn't is because we ordered 2 copies of it, and only
ordered on the 26th of october. maybe they just didn't have enough copies to
fill out all the orders at once.
Ceri :o)
