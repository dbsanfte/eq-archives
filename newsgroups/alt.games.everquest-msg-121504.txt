Actually, I think we could attain that goal much more quickly if we
treat profanity for what it REALLY is: Just words. They do it because
it's something culture shuns. Kids use excessive profanity because it
is in most kids' nature to rebel against society, and that is just one
way of doing so. If the taboo against profane language wasn't so
strong, then kids would get less of a "thrill" from using it.

That said, I still am one to shun its use in a forum such as EQ, where
the "hosts" specificly request their "guests" not to use it.
