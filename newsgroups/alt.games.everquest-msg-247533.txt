Actually, no. Displayed ATK works out as actual attack multiplied
by about 1.3, as I recall. The 'composite' attack figure displayed
differs from the actual numbers behind the scenes. In EQ beta there
were originally seperate 'to hit' and 'to damage'  numbers that
were merged as too confusing.

There are doubtless other considerations too, given the evolutions
in gameplay that have taken place.

Im dont believe it increases 'to hit'. It certainly increases average
damage though, you're right about that.

Only in that they're both displayed numbers. They do totally different
things. Dex is *almost* statistically negligible, and for melee combat
it only affects your proc/crit rate, not your damage.
