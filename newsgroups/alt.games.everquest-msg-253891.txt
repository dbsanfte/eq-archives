Actually, I see her sig fine.

I'm using Netscape as a news reader, and her sig is set off by two -'s, 
which apparantly tells us its a sig; shows up greyed on my screen, and 
when I quote her it doesn't show up at all.

I suspect your newsreader either automatically ignores sigs set off this 
way, or that you've got it set to do so.

Here it is, cut and pasted in without the dashes:

ps below is a micro "sig" set off by the same two dashes, see if you see 
them:

this is not a sig
