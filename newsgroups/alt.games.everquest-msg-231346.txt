Random ramblings ahead...

  Adastra Peraspera on FV is naggingly close to 29. She 
has her most important spells for that level ready to 
scribe if only she can get there. Just a little time in 
OT is all. She will NOT go back to HHK; even on FV it's
way overcamped. The goblins there support maybe one full 
group, but EVERYONE wants to go there. Have to check out
Splitpaw, though...

  Adastraea Starwind on TP has joined a guild. This is
the first time any of my characters has been in a guild;
they are After Hours, a group of mostly twinks. Mostly
also around level 40; it will take some time to catch up,
though I'm hopimg for some PL assistance. They do LDoN 
raids as well. Unfortunately I haven't played Ada as 
much as I should; I let impulses get the better of me. 
Log in as Neuveniu and what do you know, two hours go 
by...

  Neuv really should have been my presence on FV; she
and Tosev are easy to roleplay, and there are plenty of
evil-aligned guilds on FV. Perhaps evil characters are 
easy to play generally. When Adastra was in PC one of 
er tanks was an ogre named Granma, who was indeed made
up to looke like a grandmother - the bun-on-top hairstyle
in white, and ogre faces lend themselves to the look of
age. I am surprised to learn, however, that ogres are 
supposed to have lifespands in the centuries, like elves; 
I would have thought they would be more in line with human
lifespans, or shorter.

  Anyway, Neuv made it to 32 last night. Had a very good 
group at SF-north with a monk, cleric, and warrior, and
adding more people as we went. Heck, if I hadn't wanted to
catch the early church services today I would have pushed 
Neuv to 33, exp was flowing fast.

  Tosev is in CC, with temp and a buttload of bandages, and
four or five more buttloads in the bank. The great advantage
of monks over other melees is Mend; you can face things solo 
with 75% health instead of 50%. I'll see if I can get him to 
33 today.

  Breaking the Plane (of Valor): Half of yesterday was spent
getting Rabotev to 55 in Dulak. Zkar said a lot of diamonds
drop there. "A lot" is apparently once every hundred mobs.
Their weapons are the real money; 3-7pp each. Lot of shields,
harpoons, axes. Occasional insignias and medallions. Treasure
Sorter Neimen popped on me twice; both times he had Repugnant
Leather Boots. I /ooc'd about the second pair and a fellow 
druid a few levels below me took them.

  Broke 55 camping the Lady D. Even with root breaks (nearly
all the time; some mobs resisted/broke early five or six times)
overall mana cost per mob was less than Gorangas in ME. I
do want to investigate Nadox, but it seem syou need a key to 
get in. Who do I kill for it?

  After breaking 55 I took Rab to Tranquility and to the 
tier II access stones. Try a few, welcome to the Plane of Valor. 
Just poked my head around, didn't want to risk losing the new 
level without a guide. More zone research ahead...

  An LDoN Too Far: Gated to BB and put together an LDoN mission
really fast. Too fast, as it turned out. Rogue, beastlord,
mage, warrior, needed extra healer; someone was advertising a 
choice of four characters, one a 55 druid, so I asked him for
the druid. Then a cleric comes LFG and the group wants her. No, 
I must explain, the spot was promised to someone else, and I
invite the druid. We get a bunch of rescues I have to turn down
before a collect 22 shows up. 

  (While waiting for this I spend some time with the adventure
merchant seeing what my pile of MM points will buy. Interesting
stuff; some signifigant upgrades, boosts my wisdom/mana pool.
Guess I should do more of these...)

  Things go well until it becomes clear we are lacking in a
rather critical area: crowd control! The cleric would at least 
have let us lull. As it is, we wipe once (except for me: I
get out with 3% health left) and our poor rogue dies three times,
losing a level, before he quits. Still, we end up winning the 
mission. At the end our mage is dead and we wait for him to
get back to us before heading off to BB druid circle...but we 
wait at the front, within sight of the enemy, and a roamer hits
us, and I barely get us to BB before anyone dies again.

  Eventually we split the loot and I find I have enough points
to afford Spell: Feral Pack, wolf form that works indoors. 
People might like that. But there are many other things to buy,
so I go to Everfrost and get the surprisingly cheap Pack Shrew 
I didn't know I could afford. 

  Next up: Rab gets Pure Blood, makes more money. And Adastraea
gets more levels.
