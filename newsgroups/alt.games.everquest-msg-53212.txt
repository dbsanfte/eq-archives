Every single combine up to the 7th shawl?
And if so, do you know trivial levels for some of the other tradeskill
combos? I have a list of the shawl quest requirements and I am trying
to narrow down trivials for assorted steps.

Getting crystalline threads for the 5th shawl isn't a problem; I just
wish more crystalline silk would drop in Velks, as my tailoring is
only at skill 96. I expect I'll be looking for shardwurm bile when I
get around to camping the Broodmother for kromrif leggings...
