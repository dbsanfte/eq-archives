Many of the SOD tasks are bugged, including the Idle Hands task which is 
  required to get the iksar illusion mask.

It turns out that this bug has something to do with the way the game 
handles the following items:

Mercenaries
Familiars
Pets
Auras

For the Hand mission, you have to clear every mob out of the vicinity of 
the skull before the person with the task can /open and then loot the 
contents.   We tried this many times since the recent patch which 
prevented someone without the task opening the skull, and always got the 
message that it couldn't be opened with mobs nearby.   We tried training 
all the mobs out of the room we tried killing them all, nothing worked.

A few people reported that they had no trouble, but we couldn't 
duplicate their success.  Trolling around on the web a couple days ago I 
ran across a patch note from a developer saying he had fixed the 
problem.. well, after trying it it was clear the problem wasn't fixed, 
but since he described it as those four items, we got rid of all of 
them, then I was able to train all the mobs out of the room and my 
friend was able to loot.

I've done this about five times since, and this technique has always 
worked, so its not a fluke.

Having similar problems with some other SOD tasks in FOS and Kaesora, 
where we'd been unable to do the "beat down until the mob emotes" thing, 
getting rid of all the above baggage has also had results.

As far as I can tell, the biggest problem is mercenaries, we've had 
success with the other items up... but since familiars can be told to go 
away without removing the buff icon, there's no reason to bother having 
them up.   If you have no merc and no familiars, and still are having 
trouble, removing the pets and auras might do the trick, its worth 
trying but may not be necessary
