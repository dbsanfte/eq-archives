I don't see who I have sex with as being someone elses business. It is
a private matter.

Funny but I hardly ever hear people who like to masturbate a lot or
dress up in women's clothing, while being straight on both counts,
ever feel the need to mention it. I've never once seen something in
guild chat like:

<Bob> yeah, my girlfriend is over here

<Larry> I don't have a girlfriend but am currently rubbing myself with
my HAND! YOU MUST APPROVE OF MY CHOICE! MY HAND AND I AM TOGETHER
AND NOTHING IS WRONG WITH IT! I HAVE TO SHARE INSTEAD OF "HIDING!"

<Bob> Judas Priest LARRY!

<Fred> SUPPORT HIM BOB! Oh, by the way, I am straight but am wearing 
women's clothing. I feel the need to say this since you mentioned a
girlfriend while i don't have one but am dressed in WOMEN'S CLOTHING!
I WILL NOT BE SILENCED INTO HIDING!

<Bob> What the sam hell?!!!


Not telling people little sorid details is not "hiding." If you feel
you need to hide it, though, maybe it is some kind of a clue.
