Oh come on... you can't be that stupid can you?  I'm so sick of idiots
defending Verant/Sony for everything form nerf'n spells/items/etc. that
enable players to lvl more rapidly to pulling the game down for 12hours at a
time for  their patches that double the playing time to lvl.

Its obivous what there up to... that is if one has any functioning brain
cells.

Charge customer per month with unlimited access.  Then newest marketing
research shows the average player will create x number of players of which y
number will reach z level in 00 weeks>>>therefore average player will tire
of game in (any # of months is unacceptable to shairholders) and cancel
account.  Result; SLOW the players down!
    Note: GM's (or whoever monitors this stuff) discover more and more
players are tweaking lvl 1 players to
              higher and higher lvls thus overcomming our slowing efforts.
Suggest requiring a doubling in time (kills)
              required to level.

Lastest news.  Corporation has anunced a new EQ game to be develouped which
will address certain issues with regard to holding customers longer.  How?
Simple...
    1.  Make gear break.
    2.  Dissallow the use of better gear to lower levels (will solve problem
of player tweeking).
    3.  Allow mobs to chase players into other zones.
    4.  Etc, etc, etc....
    5.  Any any other methods we can think of!  Remember guys, we can always
do patches Sat. mornings.

GET A CLUE!!!

Cheat like hell!!!   Power real newbees anyway you can help them without
doing to much damage to their skills and tweek the hell out of any new
characters you make.

Wife and Husband EQ players for 2 years now....  but waining.
