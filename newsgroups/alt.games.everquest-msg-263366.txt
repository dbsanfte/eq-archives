Well they still have trains, and some pretty nice ones. It's hilarious 
watching someone come up from the depths of Blackburrow pulling a couple 
dozen gnoll Elites and bee-lining for the zone in. The trains are kind of 
like the ones you used to see in Crushbone at the zone-in: safe to watch 
till they hit the zone in, but then on their walk back you'd better be out 
of their way of their aggro ...

Well, after hearing this premise before and now playing the game for the 
last couple of months, I can say pretty confidently that this game is NOT 
the Sims approach to EverQuest. I don't see casual players enjoying this 
much at all. I guarantee you that none of them will craft, the crafting 
system is incredibly complex and demanding. You DIE from mistakes and you 
are constantly engaged (no time for chatting incessantly or watching TV 
while you craft). The healing model is different from EQs and requires 
vigilance and attention (no CH chains, few instant heals and long enough 
recast times that you are constantly on the edge). My wife was an Empathy 
Healer in City of Heroes and was the highest level in our guild, she was a 
master healer. She was in the EQ2 beta also and had a healer for about 10 
minutes before deciding that there was NO F'ING WAY that she was going to 
play a healer in EQ2. Way too hectic and dangerous for her tastes. She 
decided on a Rogue and is enjoying the more passive and less 
spotlight-grabbing role. But the truth is, she's started slacking off and 
I'm not sure she's going to keep up with me now, she's already falling 
behind me in levels much like she did in EQ. No, I don't think EQ2 is for 
casual players. It's a hard core game for hard core players and offers all 
the depth and complexity of the most serious MMOGs on the market, it's not 
for the faint-of-heart. The EQ for hard core and EQ2 for casual premise is 
just false. Frankly, I don't know how SOE is going to position this game.

Rebuilding Velious-era EverQuest to be published by Microsoft as Vanguard. 
But then, as Tor says, you probably knew that. ;-)
