Same problem here.

Might check out the following
http://www.speedguide.net/Cable_modems/index.shtml

I have set my TTL at 128 and my TCP Window size at 8000.  Still
playing with it but I have decreased my LD's.  My next move will be to
decrease my TCPwindow size a bit lower to see if it will help.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
