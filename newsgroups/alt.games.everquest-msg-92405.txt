 He's not meant to be a loot mob. He's meant to be a faction mob. You
can turn in salts and skins to him and get Chardok faction. He'll also
let you know if you're still KoS there although it's just as easy to con
him.

 Almost sounds like a exploit if you were to do it over and over again
(ala Soulbinders). Why not just take the lowbie char and level up legit
on mobs that fight back.
