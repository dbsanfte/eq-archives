News on the grapevine is that isn't true any more. Went from 2-300 hits
to 7-900 hits most often on the MT (big ATK upgrade), delay reduction,
proc rate increased, and a possible regen increase.

This is second hand info, so don't take it as gospel, but I was told
this by someone who was there at a killing on a different sever.

Anyone killed Tunare recently shed any light on this rumour?
