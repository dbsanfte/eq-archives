<<<<<<C'mon ... I know you're not going to give up now.  You wouldn't dare give

the last word.

Your attempts to get me to quit are still as pathetic as you are.  Just answer
the question.  How does me and my group getting a KEI adversely affect your
gaming experience in any way.  You can't.  You won't.  You don't want to see
anyone level for fear that you won't be as uber as you think you are now. 
You're a loser.
