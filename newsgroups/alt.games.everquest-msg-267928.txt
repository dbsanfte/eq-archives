All,

Does Everquest work in a 16:9 mode for 16:9 monitors? I know the game
has an artificial letterbox mode but that isn't what I'm talking
about. I want to know if 16:9 monitors (like my 61" Samsung DLP TV)
are supported without stretching a lower 4:3 resolution to fit.

Anybody playing on a 16:9 TV?

Lewis
