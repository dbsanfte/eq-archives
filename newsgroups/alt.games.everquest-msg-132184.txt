yeah, my dark elf cleric just tried some of the kaladim citizen dwarf
axe ladies in butcher at level 39 (jboots and snare necklace) She was
using wrath to nuke them mostly, one at a time. I got a half a blue
per kill which I guess is pretty good for a cleric at 39 solo. I was
at first using the snare necklace, but found it doesn't really work
well with kiling them due to how fast it is over and with the jboots
its easier to just run, pause turn, nuke, etc and they never hit me
anyway. One of them runs me about oom with 185 wis and a bunch of mana
items and such (no focus mana saving items or anything, no clarity,
only what I have myself)

I'm sort of impressed that it was possible. After doing them for 15
levels long ago on my druid I don't want to go through that
med/wait/kill thing again. It was fun to try though. Cleric is just
better in a group. I'll keep them in mind for when I want to catch up
on reading or maybe get a tv by the computer.
