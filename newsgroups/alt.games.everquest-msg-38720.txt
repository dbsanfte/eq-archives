First: Stuff like this is why I try not to get too attached to any game, EQ
included.  There's always something better, or at least new and different,
within a year or so.

Second: Verant's had lots of money coming in for two and a half years
already and they've got another year before WoW comes out.  Verant may be
considering its position but it isn't sweating.

Third: I dunno what they're doing with Luclin, but there are only so many
additions and patches you can put into a game, and only so much
effectiveness you can achieve thereby, before the demon Obsolescence waves
his silicon pitchfork.  There comes a time when you simply have either to do
a total overhaul and produce a sequel or get that other project off the back
burner.

Fourth: Creating a whole world for an MMORPG is a huge step from games with
thirty or so preset levels or random terrain generators.  The entire mapset,
cast, and quest list for Diablo II would be utterly lost if dropped into a
world the size of Norrath.  Blizzard's got the addictive gameplay down pat,
but they've taken a big bite with this project.  Whether or not they can
chew it remains to be seen.

Fifth: Blizzard is good.  The quality of Blizzard's products and the
company's commitment to quality amaze me.  They seem to take the standpoint
of "let's do good stuff because we like it and because if our products suck,
most people won't buy them, and those who do buy them will hate our guts"
instead of "let's release this POS before it's ready and see how many copies
we can sell before people catch on."  I've played games that crashed
regularly, games that didn't work properly because they were designed only
for certain processors or CPU speeds, games that were plagued with annoying
bugs, games that lacked style, games that lacked substance, games that
lacked style AND substance, games with poor interfaces, games with no
originality, games that just plain sucked.......okay, I'll stop now.  The
point is, I've also played Blizzard's games, and you know what?  I've never,
NOT ONCE, had even the most minor true complaint about them.  Oh, sure, I
quibble about Corpse Explosion being reduced and I bitch when my characters
die, but I've dumped more thoroughly enjoyable hours into Blizzard than I
did into college, I've never had technical trouble, everything does exactly
what the manual says it does, and the games run reliably using the
machine-specs posted on the box.  Originality, gameplay, interface, and
playability are consistently top-notch.  If it's five in the morning, and I
have to work at nine, and my eyelids feel as if they've got sandbags on
them, and my head droops occasionally as I nod off for a few seconds at a
time, but I am STILL PLAYING, it must be a good game, and every Blizzard
product to date has done that to me.  Blizzard hasn't disappointed me yet,
and I'm a tough critic, as much as it sounds like I'm kissing ass here.
..............Hmm. I just looked back and realized how much I typed without
coming to the point.  It's been a long, frustrating day, and I am very
tired.  I'll try not to post while exhausted in the future.  Anyway, the
point is this: I'm told EQ was horribly, almost unplayably broken when it
was released, and I feel confident that WoW will not be so.  Bugs, yes, but
minor ones that will be patched out with alacrity.

D is off to bed (and quickly, before he starts another rant!)
