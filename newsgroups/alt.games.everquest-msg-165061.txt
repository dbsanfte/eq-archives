Tunare is about many things...

1) Your guild agreeing to destroy their tunare faction
2) Your guild mindlessly clearing PoG for about 8 hours
3) Fighting stupid mobs that have far too many hp and cast silly things

Indeed, Tunare isn't a massively difficult mob.  Imo the challenge is in
clearing the zone,  infact Ail could probably be described "as tough as"
tunare

Just curious though, if shes a fairly easy mob, does that mean you've killed
her?

Ssra has some nice pokers too, if your in a guild that can do Tunare they
are probably within your reach.
Of couse for just ratio, RoS (CT) drops a 15/20 poker.. its that BS mod that
makes it sooo good though
