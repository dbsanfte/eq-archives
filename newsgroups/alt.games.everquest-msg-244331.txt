Entrap is great for this.  All it really does is save you a spell
slot...but that is enough.

Unless TW has been changed and I didn't notice, it can wear off at any
time, just like a camo or root.  Add to this the fact that snaring
with TW at any time other then just as the mob runs is useless since
it will likely wear off.  What you have is a spell that *must* hit or
the mob will run and get friends, and that is cast at a time when you
no longer have time to recast if it is resisted.  I mean that is
craziness.  The mob is going to run within seconds and you have to
land a spell on it or your group may wipe.  If it resists once or
twice: train.

Another benefit of snaring early (and unless the tank is horrible, I
snare very early) is that the mob is snared the whole time.  If
someone draws aggro, the mob will move very slowly toward him or her. 
In groups where kiting is an option, snare can save lives.  In LDONs
or other tight quarters, at the least it makes it easier for a Warrior
to reacquire aggro.  (slow-mo ping pong is much better than regular
ping pong)  If things go to shit and you need to get aggro, you now
have a little more hate from the mob as well.

I *think* I just woke a mob up today in Tactics with a stray
arrow...but I'm not certain yet.
