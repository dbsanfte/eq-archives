Best exp ive found at levl 9 was the skell tower and around the druid ring
in Butcherblocks..for some reason those skellys give more exp than
most..just watch for bandits roaming by and the dwarf guards...for loot
you cant beat the goblin drops of blood vials and green goblin head...you
just have to fight off the high levels camping em occasionally..dunno about
warrior but my troll beastlord could trade at the vendor at the druid ring
with no problem..
