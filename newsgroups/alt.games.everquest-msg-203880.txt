Well, the reasons I'd like to kill them is they are blue and there are a
whole lot of them and almost no one ever kills them.

I think I wasn't clear in my original post, since most people are talking
about how annoying the dispell is.  I don't mind getting dispelled.  The
last few times I've went to Skyfire, to do other mobs, there have been 20 or
more Chromadacs close to the relatively flat area new the BW zone corridor.

What I'm wondering is, aside from the dispell, would these guys be similar
to, say, Drakes in Cobalt Scar?  Drakes are casters, but almost never
actually damage me.  Here's how a Drake fight goes:

    1. I snare it and run away.  I snare from maximal range, and I'm out of
    casting range before it gets a spell off.

    2. I start hitting my nuke button.  My nuke has a 3 second casting time.
    When the Drake gets into range, my nuke casts, and I back away.  I don't
    know if the Drake's range is shorter than mine, or if its spell takes
    longer to cast, but whichever it is, I'm out of casting range before it
    is able to do anything to me.

    3. Repeat step #2 four more times.  Drake drops dead. :-)

If I make a mistake (say, get a fizzle, and recast rather than back off, or
if I turn to avoid backing off a cliff and get too close to the Drake) and
get hit by the Drake's magic, it does a few hundred points damage, but I can
take that, as long as I don't do it two or three times in one fight.

Note that the only buff that actually matters during this is running speed.
My running speed buff is jboots, so I can keep that up against a dispelling
mob.

So, the main factors for the Chromadacs that determine whether they are good
Wizard single-kiting fodder is (1) do their damage spells work like that of
the Drakes, and so can be avoided? and (2) if their damage spell lands (a
Necro DOT, I believe), would it be fatal to someone with about 800 HP?
