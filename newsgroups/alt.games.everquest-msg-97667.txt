Get into the Device Manager and see how Windows is assigning IRQs.
Perhaps some other device is sharing an IRQ with your mouse. 
Windows 98, at least, in its infinite wisdom will do this and
not think twice about it. When I put in a new Nvidia card, Windows 
blithefully assigned it the same IRQ as my ethernet card. I had to 
move cards around in the PCI slots until it gave every card its 
own IRQ.
