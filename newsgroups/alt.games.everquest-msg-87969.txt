I was just on EQ and a Sys/wide message came through that there is something
afoot this weekend...  Can't wait to see how many Corpse Runs we have to do
during this one... hehe

Also, can anyone tell me whether tiny daggers are available in Qeynos?  I
know I can get them in Euridin, but I hate boats with a passion...

Thanks
