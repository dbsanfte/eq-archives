It certainly didn't seem stupid to me when I was in the Navy, living in a 
shitty little barracks room, and dealing with the Icelandic winter.  OK, I 
only spent $5k, but it was 10 years ago.  Not everything is black and 
white.  (Hell, between my gf and I we have 2 rather expensive cars, and 
live in a small apartment in NYC, even to me that seems stupid but it 
makes sense if you know the circumstances.)

not buying a horse anytime until the stack with Selos, and then still not 
buying a horse
