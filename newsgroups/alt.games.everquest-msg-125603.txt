I'm in a similar position as you time wise (can't commit 4 hour blocks to
EQ), so I basically solo with multiple toons.

I've triple botted a warrior, druid and chanter.  Once the tank is above
level 45, the chanter slow and haste is required.  The druid snare comes in
very handy also.  I would gladly trade the chanter and druid for a shammy if
partnering with a melee. Since I don't play the super high level game, I
would also swap out the warrior for a hybrid.

Druid / Necro - Buffs, regen, ports, sow, ok pet to tank with.  DOTs stack.
Both toons can snare.  Druid can harmony for single pulls.  Necro can slow
undead mobs.  Druid hosed for mana regen in this scenario.
Shammy / Necro - Shammy buffs, plus haste and slow (huge for level 45+).
Shammy get's decent pet.  Necro can still snare.  No harmony for single
pulls but necro can FD. Both get some version of mana regen. A 60 necro in
my guild regulary partners with a 60 shammy for awesome EXP.  No porting.

The shammy / necro combo is nice because if you want to raid at the higher
levels, a shammy is a desired toon.  Druid and Necro's aren't as needed.

You can easily setup hot keys for the druid to heal the other player, assist
cast dots, etc.  The hardest part is if you have to run, but you can setup a
key on one to target and follow the other toon.

I've never played a Ranger so this may be bad advice, but a shammy / ranger
combo may be good.  Ranger get's harmony and snare and is an OK tank.  Fear
kiting animals would be the way to go.  But that is hard to do botting two
toons.  Tracking is cool also.

Good luck.
