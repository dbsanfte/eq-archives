I call bs on this . I ran a druid to 60, a chanter to 60 , a monk who is 57
now, a cleric to 51, a rogue to 51, a wizard to 51, and gobs of lesser
twinks. The druid was by far the hardest to level. The druid was by far the
hardest to get a good group with. The druid is not even the best soloer for
either experience or loot (monk and chanter respectively). The monk and
cleric are almost always the most usefull at high end raids.

The druids greatest disadvantage is that he reaches his peak in power at
level 29. Everyone forms there opinions on classes early , and even though
an experienced player can run any class to 30 in very little time, they keep
this impression. The only ones who know any better are those that have
played more than one class all the way up with one of those classes being a
druid.
