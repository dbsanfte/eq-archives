You get it at 54 and it is based on double attack. Quoting Kendrick's 
comments on Kunarkian rogues: 

Double Backstab. This is simply a tackon to the Double Attack skill 
you've had for 40 levels already. Your chances of doing a double BS are 
identical to you chances of swinging twice with your primary weapon in 
normal melee. A better than 50/50 chance, btw.
