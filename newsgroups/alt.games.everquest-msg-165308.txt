The Cleris epic is nice for rezing large raids.  If your not doing this I would
not go threw the effort, altho it is now easer to get ragefire.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind.
Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
--Thomas Jefferson
