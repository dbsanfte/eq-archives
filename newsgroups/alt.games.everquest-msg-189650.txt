Nope its only of use in a group situation so you can readily max it out in
solo situations, or small groups where you are main tank and not having to
pull critters off other melee types so much as tell the casters and
clerics to hold of the casting til you have good aggro. Also with another 
warrior where it doesnt matter who has aggro so long as it isnt one of
the weaker ones behind you and you can practise.... 

If you have spare training points use them on it.
