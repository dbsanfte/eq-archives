> Not something I recommend.  Limits your flexibility.

Possibly, although cant say I have really noticed. I have actualy
found it frees up some of my time during the combat to better keep an
eye out for adds etc.

Although most of my xping so far has been out of doors, in not too
intense pulling situations - the style of play of the people I group
with is fairly laid back, too laid back for some who have joined us,
as we don't over pull when we can help it.

Of course if you were worried that by having songs macroed you have to
wait for a fixed time before you throw in a song not normally part of
your medley, you could always have another macro that is just /stop
song.
