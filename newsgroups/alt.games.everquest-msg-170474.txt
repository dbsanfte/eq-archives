The most accurate answer: It depends.
- on what you are combining, and what skill
- on your INT, WIS, or whatever the heck that tradeskill is dependant

Sometimes, if the recipe involves a rarer drop or forage, the skillups 
seem to come faster. But this is not a hard and fast rule. It all falls 
on the Random Number Generator.

I managed to go 200 to 226 on about 100 tries per skill up. Then they 
made baking a little easier, and it was closer to 40 per skill up.

Again, it falls on the shoulders of the random number generator. You'll 
either make it or you won't. I suceeded first try at 240. I have a 
friend who failed four times at 250.

Regardless, I'm not going to even think of how much I have spent on the 
tradeskill.
