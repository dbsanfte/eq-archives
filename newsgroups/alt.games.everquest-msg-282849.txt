Sometimes.  Not always.

Bard song and Enchanter spell for faction are self-only.  Grouping with them
won't help.  Many enchanters can illusion you, though, so if the KOS is caused
by race, that can help.  

It's pretty rare to be KOS based purely on race, though.  Illusions won't hide
religion or past faction hits.

If the NPC is charmable AND you can do the turnin when indifferent, this
usually works, and you get the faction for the turnin.  If you have to be
amiable to do the turnin, then you have be the one who charms the NPC to do
the turnin.

Most quest NPCs nowadays are not charmable, so this won't help.  It works in a
lot of old-world quests, though.  Other things that used to work but mostly
don't anymore are doing the turnin while invisible, or just letting the NPC
attack you and doing the turnin anyway.  Sometimes you had to start the handin
invisible, then click off invis and click "give" instantly after, and hope the
handin occurred before the NPC killed you.

And, as someone else said, a lot of factions have a way to build them without
using the KOS npc.
