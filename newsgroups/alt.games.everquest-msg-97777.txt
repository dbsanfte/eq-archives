Because I am drawing on the *facts* of previous experience. I am not

generalities. I compare the future with what happened in similar
situations previously. Duh.

And in doing this you have come to the conclusion that the changes are
bad? Or are you just spouting for the hell of it?

Irrelevant since there is no difference between your thinking process
