Yep, as you say that makes it sound to me low one will be jboots
speed.. and if you go by the incremental price the 15 k one will be a
small margin faster than the 9 k one. Otherwise, if the 9 k one was
jboots speed (like they said) then who would buy it instead of the 15
k one if the 15 k one was level 50 sow speed? Answer: 

No one would.

If you can afford 9 k you'd be able to scrounge 15 k. So I'm thinking
if 9 k is jboots speed like they said then 15 k must be a small
incremental boost which won't seem worth it for 6 more k to the people
paying 9.
