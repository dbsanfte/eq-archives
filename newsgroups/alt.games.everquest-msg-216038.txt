Lucy got a lot better with the item collector (sadly, their item info
has not been updated since LDoN release) in large part because you
could tell if a particular spell was scribable by glancing at the
"Items" line to see if it had a scroll.  Unfortunately this doesn't
work with LDoN (yet) as they don't seem to have any LDoN item data.

I go to CR when looking up the location of older (pre-LoY) spells, but
even that data is significantly out of date (quite a few times I went
to out of the way places to get Kunark/Velious era Druid spells, only
to later discover that all or most of the "hard to find" spells were
actually located on 2 very convenient vendors who weren't mentioned,
or who were mentioned for only a tiny fraction of the spells they sell).
For LoY and later spells google almost always leads me to Allakhazam,
occasionally to a class board.
