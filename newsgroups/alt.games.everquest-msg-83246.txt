is it possible to do this somehow.

eg

load eq
load 1st character
sort out keyboard mappings for 1st character
quit eq
copy the file that has all keyboard mappings for the 1st character to say
folder_01

then

load eq
load 2nd character
sort out keyboard mappings for 2nd character
quit eq
copy the file (the same one thanks to eq's shortcomings) that now has all
keyboard mappings for the 2nd character to say folder_02.

then before you fire up eq the next time you just copy the appropriate file
into the eq directory.

ive started a bard and my necro setup is inadequate for all this twisting
songs and swapping instruments stuff.

TIA
