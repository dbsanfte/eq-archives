Greetings:

I have a level 34 twinked monk and I am looking trade his gear for magician
gear.

A few of the notable items include:

Fungi tunic
jade mace
stave of shielding
silver chitten hand wraps

Lots of twink items to take a new character all the way into the late 50's.
All good items and all slots full. At level 34 my monk has 1100 hps. I am
looking to trade items for items.

Trade must include all good mage items including burnt wood staff. Trade
must be fairly equal and if you need to add plat that's acceptable. If your
items are better I'll add plat.

Thanks
