Don't worry about the DoT killing the mob. So long as the total damage you
did (DDs and DoTs combined) exceeds that of the pet, you'll get full exp
for the kill. What I normally do is fight like normal until I judge the
hps to be at half, then it's a nuke race to the finish line. (A hasted
dual wielding double attacking bashing kicking enchanter pet vs a slowed
mob turns into one hell of a nuke race... and many times I lose)

Against even cons or dangerous blues, don't worry about winning the
race. Take half exp and enjoy it. But against easy blues just start
nuking early.
