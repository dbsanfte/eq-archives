    Rogues pull in NToV? News to me. And monk damage isn't situational -
parsing is showing that monks are putting out damage out of line with the
1.2xWarrior:1.4xWarrior ratio with rogues they were "supposed" to have.

    So those "17 K in two minutes of Trueshot" logs were all crap? That's in
the range of 140 DPS, which is a very nicely equipped rogue with 100% back.
Not something to sneeze at. I also recall those logs were pre-acrylia arrow
and pre-Archery Mastery....

    I can't speak to the quality of shaman you play with, but ours don't do
that unless they're mid-cast when it's called (apparently ducking is beneath
them). On a tough raid-level mob, they might keep trying, but never in an XP
grind.
