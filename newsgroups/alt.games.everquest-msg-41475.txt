Sorry, the King of Terror translation is well known and one of the clearer
ones that Nostradamus made.  Email me and I will give you several sources
and will not charge you 50 dollars.  As for its meaning, like all such
material it is open to wide interpretation, and my personal belief is that
most of Nostradamus offerings concern the politics of his own day and the
French court of the mid-16th century.  This one though because of its
clarity and the synchronicity of yesterdays events will undoubtedly get a
lot of attention.  Still, like all such statements, it only makes sense
through hind-sight and should be considered with great caution and
skepticism.
