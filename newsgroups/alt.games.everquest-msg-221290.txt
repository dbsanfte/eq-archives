This little dismissal just doesn't wash. The changes affect everyone
globally whether they use them or not - in terms of attitudes, in
terms of where the population goes, etc.

And he's right. The game was better before PoP. Luclin was hit and
miss, but PoK destroyed most of the good that was left. It's a good
thing some of EQ's graces are good enough to still make it tolerable
after the disasterous PoP and LDoN expansions... but its really
starting to sink.
