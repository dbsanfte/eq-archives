That's the way I assumed it would work, since that's exactly how it is in 
the command list I had.  But, it just don't work, unfortunately.  I haven't 
played but a few hours in the last 4-6 days, but the next time I log on, I 
will try to remember to try it again and /bug it if it doesn't work.  If 
everyone /bug reports it, maybe it will get fixed...

Nah.  The SLEW of bugs they will be dealing with in the near future will 
definitely put something like this on the back-burner until 2003, and by 
then maybe Neverwinter Nights will be released...
