I agree with this 100%.

It matters not how much damage each person does.  I know this for an
absolute fact because I often duo with my ranger wife.  Sometimes I
will swarm kite killing 30 mobs in a row, and she deals 0... ZERO
damage to them, yet the xp is divided between us exactly 50/50.  We
level at the same rate.
