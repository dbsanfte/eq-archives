The problem with SZ is that people can train, bind-camp, zone camp,
portal camp and basicly gank people with no fear of reprocussion. The
rules there allow people to abuse the fuck out of game limitations. If
a few high level wizards choose to sit at a druid ring and nuke
everyone that pops, you'll be dead before you even finish loading. No
chance of fighting back or running. Same with zone lines...

SZ is a greifer's paradise. I don't see the fun in being killed before
I finish loading a zone. I don't see the fun in being trained
repeatedly. I don't see the fun in my level 20 character being able to
be killed in one nuke by some bored level 60 wizard... At least on
Rallos, there are some rules to keep things reasonably fair and thus
more enjoyable...
