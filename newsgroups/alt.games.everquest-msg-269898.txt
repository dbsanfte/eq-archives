: Anyone know which has more roleplaying
: or are they pretty much the same?  Thanks again!

I'm on the Lucian RP server, and I encounter a good deal of role-playing.  I 
(as a cleric) enjoy chiding barbarians about their lack of smarts, and they 
enjoy treating me like a reluctant tag-along.  "Come on, elf, or we'll leave 
you here for the bugs," is something I heard last night.

In fact, I allow my role-playing to be =enhanced= by those people who don't 
role-play.  For example, last night one of the group members told us she had 
to get the phone, and I asked the group about this new god called Phone. 
Everyone laughed and asked what I was talking about.  I told them that 
humans frequently had to answer the call of Phone and would then meditate 
for several minutes.  I was impressed by their devotion but wanted to know 
more about what powers the god of Phone bestowed upon their adherents.

Then THEY began to role-play and told me about how the Phone god did nothing 
for them, but that its adherents were mostly human females!  It was 
hysterical and a lot of fun.  The bottom line is that I encounter as much 
role-playing as I make.
