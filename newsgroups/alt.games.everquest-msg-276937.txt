You say tomato... I say tomato.

The combination of what the code enforces, what the Code of Conduct 
says, what the EULA says... PLUS what the developers 'intend' on an 
abstract level comprise the rules of the game.

Consider the numerous times GMs were on hand to watch the uberguilds 
tackle endgame encounters, and the times they intervened and stopped the 
event because they felt the encounter was not being played "as 
intended". In those cases, the rules in the developers heads superceded 
the rules enforced by the code they had written.

The point is that the 'rules of the game' are not limited to what the 
client/server will allow to take place. If I write a generic board game 
engine that simply allows players to move pieces wherever they will, you 
can still play chess with it. Arguing that moving your pawn ahead 5 
spaces is legal simply because the 'game engine' doesn't prevent it 
outright is just silly. Similiarly the EQ software is something of a 
generic 'world engine' that allows quite a number of 'moves' that are 
against the more abstract rules of Everquest, like "kill stealing" and 
"training" for example.

> That said: Kill stealing is prohibited in modern MMORPGs by "locking"
> mobs;

While the everquest software doesn't prevent kill stealing, its still 
against the rules. Personally, I prefer it that way. Mob Locking in 
"modern" games prevents a large number of perfectly legitimate 
encounters from taking place.

> bad language is often caught by swear filters etc.

Don't be naive. I can suggest you shove your head so far up the back end 
of your gastrointestinal tract that you'll choke on your own hair 
without so much as blipping the 'swear filters'. Yet were I to say such 
a thing, I'd still be punished. And my defense that "If it were against 
the rules to say it, your filters would have stopped me!" would hold 
about as much water as a seive. 

(As an inside joke to a.g.e.rs ... Or perhaps I'd just call you a 
"Pu55y" and then kick up a storm about how it just means coward and 
nothing offensive, and the filters let it through so it can't be against 
the rules...)

Some elements of "modern games" suck. Training to cause death and xp 
loss is against the rules in Everquest, though not enforced by the game 
software. But the fact that the game engine physically allows it allows 
for all sorts of daring rescues, desperate escapes, and all manner of 
other great encounters. Watching you rush towards me with your train of 
mobs while not so much as stepping to the left because I know that I may 
as well not even exist as far they're concerned is hardly an immersive 
quality.

In fact, it causes me to ask why bother playing in a multiplayer game if 
you aren't able to affect me?

You can say that but I maintain that your dead wrong.

So now we agree its against the rules then? (Lets look at the whole 
transaction please, not just half. Even prostitution is ok if we just 
look at the two halves independantly after all.)

/shrug 

If you want to play the semantics game...

A real sword of metal is only a particular arrangment of energy in the 
unverse, no different than your virtual one.

Asserting that the energy expended in creating the former is somehow 
relevantly different then the energy in the second one; or that energy 
as matter somehow is intrinsically special for the purposes of deciding 
what exists is just silly. An idea in my head is just as real as a sword 
both legally and physically (as in with respect to 'physics'). And we 
have laws that protect IP as real property, without getting bogged down 
in handwaving about how they're just "time spent" without any other 
resource involved...

So, in other words, what difference does it matter what the 'resources' 
are?

Now is there any real reason we can't just call it a sword, and agree 
that you bought it?

So what?

Prostitution is illegal in many jurisdictions. Yet simply giving women 
money, and/or having sex with them "In isolation" isn't. The sum is 
greater than the parts... go figure.

Nobody disputes that you can hand swords around in EQ "in isolation". 
I'm not even sure what your trying to prove by stating that obvious 
fact.

The point is, that when said exchange is done for RL cash, then it 
violates the rules. Motive matters. Period. The fact that the software 
can't read your mind and determine your motive is irrelevant to the fact 
that ebaying is against the rules.

Just as losing a boxxing match is within the rules, but throwing it and 
having your family and friends bet on your opponent isn't.

> and DOES
> NOT give any advantages that can be considered "cheating".

Advantages technically don't matter. You are viewing 'cheating' too 
narrowly. Many games contain rules that simply arbitrarily dictate 
conduct or environmental conditions. The FIFA rules specify the spacing 
of the goal posts for example, yet provided they are the same on both 
ends of the field neither team has an advantage if the rule is violated, 
nonetheless a ref could and likely would disallow a world-class game on 
such a field even if the spacing was out by mere inches, and forfeit the 
game to the visiting team if it wasn't corrected promptly.

The point of -that- little tangent was to demonstrate that the rules can 
be arbitrary, and have no clear bearing on 'advantages'. Sadly, it 
doesn't really contribute to the discussion at hand because...


Your contention that it doesn't confer advantage is incorrect.  Your 
premise has been that it 'levels' the playing field so that "rich 
casuals" can keep up with the the "hard core players". Correct?

Even if that were true, consider the rich hard core players? Now they 
can play 24x7, and then buy their way into even greater power than can 
even be obtained by playing 24x7. 

In fact, with enough RL wealth I could be the most powerful player in EQ 
and never even log in. Most games/sports limit the degree of money being 
able to influence outcomes. Everquest, not surprisingly, does too. You 
are allowed to buy faster hardware, you can even own and login as many 
accounts as you want and can afford... but you aren't allowed to buy 
stuff with real money.

Is it so hard to accept that its simply against the rules?

Failing to see the connection. The rules (and EULA) are not being 
violated there.

I've never even disputed that.

And...

The GAME RULES want the player to buy the droppable items by trading 
other in game droppables (be it pp, tradeskill items, or equivalent 
droppables, or as gifts, or in exchange for favours like performing a 
difficult combine, casting a buff, or rezzing a corpse, or collaborating 
on a difficult quest); that is what is meant by -in game economy- and 
that is -why- the EULA specifically forbids selling them for cash.

They do -not- want you to use RL wealth.
