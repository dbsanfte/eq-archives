The new summoned hammers play right into my hands as a paladin
wanabee, significantly improving my melee output.  I should love
them.  But I don't.  I use them because I love being able to
melee decently, but I dont' like the weapon itself.

Why?  Because its a storebought carbon copy of what every other
cleric has.  I'm a cookie cutter cleric all of a sudden, with two
great loot item weapons and a freaking Epic weapon all useless
beside a  spell I daring bought from a vendor after spending
seconds saving up the 6pp it cost to buy the thing.

Its nothing special, and its nothing different.

OK, so now I have the 58 hammer.  Looks the same.  Same stats.
Same proc.  Same proc message.  You only know I have it if you
inspect me carefully or maybe you are a beancounter capable of
discerning the increased proc rate via observation.  Someday I'll
have the 60 hammer.  Oooh, guess what.  Same damn hammer, same
damn stats, same damn proc, maybe a little more often than the
58.  Major yawn.

I go on raids, I don't even consider weapon drops, because I know
they can't compete.

What I think they should have done, should still do, is make the
Hand of God into a spell which operates as a buff on the caster,
adding stat and proc over the top of whatever weapon I'm
weilding.  Say give it bard style 20% haste (similar to the low
delay of the hammer) and 25 dex and the Hand of God proc, working
similarly to the Katta's Sword Dancing bard song, but with an
hours long duration instead of 18 seconds.

This would mean a cleric with a rusty mace would be different
from one with Righteousness or Adjel's Cudgel.. and those two
weapons would be different from each other, so I could pick and
chose one to fit my opponent, instead of taking Hammer of
Divinity against anything whatsoever.
