If the arrangement is to do the MQ first, then receive payment,
try this:  Just before the MQ, ask to see the payment
(items and/or cash) in a trade window.

It's not foolproof, but in general a scammer wouldn't
even have the items/cash on him if he was planning to cheat
you, and his inability (or refusal) to "show you the money"
would be a sure sign to refuse to do the MQ for him, and
then you'll know never to deal with him again.
