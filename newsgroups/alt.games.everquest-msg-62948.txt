Saw a hilarious female dwarf paladin of level 59 on my server with a
beard. The fun thing is female dwarf paladins are so rare anyway and
even more fun is the fact that it was a bearded one. She was all in I
think Tov velious quest plate which was blue on her (skyshrine?) as it
is on dwarf of gnome clerics. She also had a converted velious helm
which is KICK ASS on female dwarves, it has like big curved ram horns
and is quite cool (more so because you never see female dwarves that
high in velious gear)

The odd thing is at 59 and all this stuff and looking fun and having
the beard, her name was:

Looka Likaman

Which did make me laugh actually when I caught that, but then made me
puzzle over how she could still have that name at 59 when it breaks
the rule of first and last name making a phrase? Its also a shame
because it was such a unique character.. a more creative name would
have impressed me. This just gave me a laugh.
