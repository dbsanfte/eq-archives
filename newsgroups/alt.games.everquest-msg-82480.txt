Lol, you know I never thought of it as a dupe bug.  I've heard of them, but
never really looked into what they were.  As far as doing it again, I'm too
chicken.  Not of getting caught, but of losing exp, hehe.  I've just hit 30
for the first time, and DAMN does that bar move slow!
Not worth the extra plat.
