Depending on your tastes, you may find Morrowind worth a bash.

If your system can handle Luclin comfortably, it should have no troubles
hardware-wise with Morrowind. And it's a first-person RPG in an incredibly
large and rich world with a mind-boggling array of things to do. There's
also an expansion that's been released recently.

I haven't played it much recently - been playing EQ pretty much to
the exclusion of all else lately - but what I've seen is very, very good.

Neverwinter Nights is also good and there are new (and good) third-party
modules being released all the time. Of course getting those modules
may be a problem if you're offline, but you can grab some in advance.
The main problem I found (in the single person campaign at least) was
that healing was too easy - any class could simply rest to heal and
replenish spells immediately, typically with little or no risk. That made
the game itself too easy except for "boss" encounters.

If you want something non-RPGish... for strategy, Age of Wonders 2,
perhaps, or Warcraft 3. Civ3 is OK, but the magic is gone for me.
Railroad Tycoon Gold should be very cheap by now (and is very good).

Other genres I mostly ignore...
