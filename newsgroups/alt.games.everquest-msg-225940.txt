Come on, you can't try to tell me that anyone on SOE's CS dept cares about
the naming policy anymore.
I've seen far worse names than this with the ` character in them, so someone
had to petition to have that added.

Rule 3 may come into effect through the ignorance of the CSR you are
speaking to. If they do say no, on religeous grounds, don't argue, just
petition it another time.
