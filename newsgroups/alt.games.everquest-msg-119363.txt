None...my level 60 rogue created in April of 99 was a Dex/Agi
rogue.

My level 53 rogue created in October of 2000 was a straight
Sta rogue.

Besides the differences in levels, and that fact that my second
rogue has much better equipment than my first rogue did
at that stage, I can't say anything is too difficult on the first
compared to the second.

Heck, it's not like they're all going to be maxxed when Avatar
proc's anyways :-).
