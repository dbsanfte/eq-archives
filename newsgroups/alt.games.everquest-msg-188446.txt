That on top of the fact that charms break, meaning you suddenly have two
mobs that hit in the 500+ range agroed on you.

Not to mention an inability to heal the pet, requiring you to break the
charm and get a new pet frequently.

Enchanters do not have it easy, no class goes down (dies) faster or more
frequently than an enchanter, in my experience or that of several 60+
enchanters that I know quite well (no, I don't play one personally, yet).
Even druids have a lot less ability to solo at low risk in that level range,
although if you do learn to play one solo at planes levels the losses from
frequent deaths are mitigated by the XP rythm.

The only really great exp is getting into a good, solid group that works
well together and just pounding mob after mob after mob to dust. My total
exping time (not play time, but time spend in a group actively exping) from
ding 64 to ding 65, including a heavy raid schedule, was probably around 18
hours.
