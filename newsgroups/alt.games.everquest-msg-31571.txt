The thought "rules in the game and my feelings on them do not necessarily
extend to what I think about actual laws in real life" comes more to mind.
If someone chooses to petition about a name, then ok 100% go for it (as I
conceeded in other posts), but no I do not think not feeling a duty to do it
is apathy. That being said, not turning someone in for breaking the law
might qualify as apathetic, not turning someone in for oh say chewing gum in
class (a rule but not true law, were anyone still in school hypothetically)
in my opinion is hardly apathetic. So yeah, you guessed wrong. I've also
seen nowhere in Verant's rules that it is our job to petition names that do
not follow rules, if such a rule exsists then I suppose apathy might apply
to game play as well.
