I don't know of any list...you just learn them as you go along (at least, I
do).  Don't worry, when you see the "would not take hold" message you have
not lost any mana.  To learn why it didn't take hold, ASK the person what
buffs they have up that do about what yours does.

HP buffs that you can give to others generally don't stack with another
class's, but there are exceptions (cleric symbol stacks with everything, I
think).   I know of no AC, STR or AGI buffs that stack.

Again, don't worry about it...it'll come to you as you play.
