Microsoft, in their usual infinite wisdom, decided to add QOS 
"enhancements" in Windows XP to all network interfaces by default! This 
means up to 20% of your bandwidth is being reserved for QOS crap if a 
program requests it to do so. This may be the cause of your 
disconnections, since perhaps the modem (if you are using one) can't 
sustain the 5KB/s data transfer which is set in the datarate.txt file in 
your EQ directory by default due to this lovely little feature. Turn it 
off and see if it still happens.
