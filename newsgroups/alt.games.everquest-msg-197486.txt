My lineup (pre stoicism) was:

Gate
Heal
Swap
Swap
Swap
Root
Canni
Regen

The swap slots I'd use for buffing pre fight, and then during fighting I'd
generally have:
Slow
Poisen
Disease / Quickness (if I feel lazy)

If I wasn't being lazy, I would swap Quickness in and out of the Regen spot.
I only use those slots for buffing so if I forget to swap back, I haven't
lost heal / gate / root all of which could be important if caught off guard,
and so they're always in the same space making them easy to find.

I'd be perfectly happy to fight without having just refreshed any buffs, and
if one drops during a fight, either just wait till the end of the fight, or
root the mob, back out and swap Regen for whatever and do the buffing.

I have regen on at all times. I'm not a Troll, so I've not got innate regen,
but the reason I use it is not for advantage during fights, but because I
can canni a significant amount more mana back during the regens lifetime
than it costs to cast.

Once I got my pet, I stopped hasting myself and just hasted him normally,
but still did all the tanking (he can't take a beating).

SoWing - it lasts half an hour. You'll get caught when it drops at a bad
time at some point, but that's very rare. You'll get your black fur booties
at some point and then it'll become moot anyway!
