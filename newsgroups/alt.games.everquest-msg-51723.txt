I spent and entire day collecting ingredients to combine in the concordance
for azia and beza practice runes .. after making 20 runes of each and using
them in my research book I didnt acquire one single point .. thats after
putting one point in research ( verant wont let you use more than one
point ) .. my mage is level 17 .. whats the deal here ? another verant
hosing ? BTW .. where did all the muffins go ? why did verant in its wisdom
? ( stupidity ) get rid of them ? they were the perfect monk food item
