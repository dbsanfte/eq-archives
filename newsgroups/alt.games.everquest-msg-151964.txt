To me it just seems kind of random.  My bard is at 51 now and all instrument
skills are maxxed.  Sometimes I could let wind or brass blow all night and
sometimes get a single point at best while other times I could let it blow
and take the dog for a short walk/kick/pull/drag and it would go up 3 or 4
in a short amount of time.

Keep trying.  It will go up eventually.
