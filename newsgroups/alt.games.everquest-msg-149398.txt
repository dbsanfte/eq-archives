Can't use magelo, so I went back to eqtraders to look. Chalk that one
up to lack of sleep for a week running - I only looked at unimbued
heraldic and assumed that the classes carried through to the imbued
stuff. (I just had a nap, though. Going to have another one now :) )
And if it's any comfort, my WE warrior can't wear Heraldic either, but
that's because she's agnostic :)
