Umm, dork, I never put that forward as an idea. Morelyn invented it
all by himself.

Duh. And that's the only statement I made here.

Why, thank you! Knowing you find me annoying brightens my day.

By all means, *do* debate with me. But when you do, I expect you to
make and demonstrate points, not whine like a spoiled child. If you
act like a child, you'll be treated like one. Sorry that bothers you
so much, anon.

>VI is never wrong.

That position is often attributed to me by morons. People who don't
suffer from selective reading problems, however, know that I feel
quite otherwise.
