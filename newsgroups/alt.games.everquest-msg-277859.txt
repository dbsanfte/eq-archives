I can. There were a lot of naysayers that claimed that blizzard would 
succumb to hacks and exploits and would never have a playable game. I 
recall MUCH trolling on the subject.

I don't know why they thought diablo2 which was barely more than a lan 
game with a server side character repository and player matching service 
would be representative of what they could and would do with a full 
client server architecture.

Personally I had a great deal of faith in Blizzard. They have a 
reputation for putting out -fun- games. WoW by all accounts is no 
exception, and so far hacks and exploits are no more rampant there than 
any other mmog from what ive heard.

True enough.

The scum who've been abusing this system would have to ask themselves: 
Why would I want 120kpp or 250kpp for item X. I want $100.00US.

There will be a market for coinage, for vendor sinks at least. But 
anything that can be bought for 500kpp, will be available for USD 
straight up. If SOE is the facilitator, why would you bother with pp for 
the transaction at all.

If SOE facilitates items for cash directly. Most guilds and players who 
can farm the really good stuff have little need for coin, if it was 
sanctioned and simple why would they even bother to dump items in the 
bazaar when they can flip them for cash instead.

IGE as the item broker will go away, but IGE as the item 
supplier/generator will skyrocket.
