Silk items are really easy.  You make a silk swatch by combing two spider
silks (spiderling silks will not work).  Then you combine the swatch with
the pattern for the piece you want to make.  Patterns for silk do not have
sizes,  the silk pieces will fit all sizes.  All silk items use one swatch
except leggings and tunics which need two. So if you need to get your skill
up by practicing first, make the items that only require one silk first.
