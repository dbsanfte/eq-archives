So, you were effectively grouping without the benefit of ease of 
communication or the ability to go through the mobs faster for more xp 
(even with no grouping bonus)? 

I think I get it now, only it should probably be taken a tiny step 
further - cut xp gained from all mobs by, say, 25-50%. *Then* we'll have 
something more along the lines of what you're describing. :P

You were all there hunting the same stuff at the same time, for crying 
out loud. Why not group so you can do it more efficiently? Where is the 
benefit of remaining solo?
