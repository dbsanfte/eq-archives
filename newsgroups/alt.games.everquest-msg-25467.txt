Yes, I've noticed this when other players have tried to give me stuff
when my inventory is full.  However, I have noticed recently that when
I try to buy something from a vendor when my inventory is full, the
vendor will say something like "How can you buy this?  You don't have
any room in your inventory to put it" and not sell it to you till you
make room in your inventory.  Has this been a recent thing or have
they always done this and I've just been slow in picking up on it? :-)
