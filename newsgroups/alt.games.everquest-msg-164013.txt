Hi everyone:

I'm eager to learn if anyone has had the same experiences as I'm having
after the last patch. I'm a level 60 Wizard, I wear a Jungle Spider Fur Cap,
this gives me extended damage three. I also have spell casting fury three ..
I hunt in the Grey and *very* regularly had critical hits of near, and
sometimes well over 2000 with Ice Spear of the Solist. Very nice too, I was
pleased ...

Just before the latest patch (the one that changed the spell icons that were
wrong) I dinged the AA point that gave me sufficient points to purchase
spell casting fury mastery one! I was very excited and promply spent my AA's
..

However, I'm now noticing a *significant* *decrease* in the number of
critical hits I'm getting .. In fact I think Ice Spear has procced *two*
crits in about ten hours of play! Now, rather than hit harder my Ice Spear
spell either hits for the low teens, low hundreds or is totally resisted
even by light blue blue mobs!

Here was I thinking SCFM would increase my damage output via crits, and now
I'm hardly landing an decent hit .. Anyone else noticed?

Thank you for your time as always ..

Stevie.
