Hi guys,

I just wanted to send an apology to the group for "spam"

I read a post in one of my other newsgroups and thought it "might" work. I'm
really hurting right now so I passed it along thinking it would be nice if I
could make a few extra (very needed) dollars. I wanted all of you to know I
didn't mean to spam your group. I apologize.....
