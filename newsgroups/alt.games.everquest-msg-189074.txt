I do have a bit of an idea of what it was like.  After all, just about every
country I've hit in the navy used a different currency.  Anyways, I'm not
talking so much about the Euro, which I can understand, but the degree to
which the EU will end up controlling now-independent nations of Europe.  If
you want an example of how this is pretty much inevitable, look at what
happened in the U.S., as the federal government has grabbed an
ever-increasing share of the state's power.  Or, take a look at the U.N.
Twenty years ago, nobody would have said it was the U.N.'s job to run the
world, as I've heard some say in protest to Dubya's policies.  I doubt this
level of control will come in our lifetimes, as it took two hundred years
for the U.S. to get to this point (though the U.N. has encroached much
faster).  I dunno, I guess I just think that the nations of Europe do have
something to contribute to the world, and don't want to see them swallowed
up by corporate Europe.
