Has anyone mentioned Druids?  They are very good soloers and since he
was looking at a cleric, he may like the ability to serve as healer as
well as soloer...

Druids can solo just about anything the necros can, but they will just
tend to take longer to do it.  [Their damage over time (DoT) spells are
usually not as good, they cannot regen mana nearly as fast, and their
pet is only slightly better than useless].

Newbie FYI: By "tank", he means make the monster hit you and no one
else.

fear-kiting.

I agree but want to point out a few things.

1) You *can* tank dark blues all the way to 70.
2) You will want to tank dark blues from time to time, all the way to
70.

One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to let your defensive skill
fall seriously behind.  If you get to 65 or 70 and your defensive skill
is 8, you will have a tough time raising it.  This is a skill that you
cannot train with a guildmaster.  You have to let them beat on you.
And at 65 or 70, a dark blue-con mob (the color it appears when you
target it or /consider it) will do massive damage to you.  If your
defense skill has fallen behind, the damage is just that much worse.
It becomes very difficult to raise defense.

How does a necro tank a tough mob?  Tap tanking.  Let the mob hit you
while you continuously lifetap to heal yourself.  It runs you out of
mana very quickly, and is not generally an efficient solo strategy.
But it is one way to keep defense up even at high levels.

...I know, I had to do it at level 67 in order to max out defense from
a pathetic skill of around 50.  (I found shadowhaven merchants to work
well for this, even if it did take hours and hours).
