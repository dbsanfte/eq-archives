A few questions for those beastlords out there.

1. As I understand it, it is pretty easy soloing as a beastlord, is that
true?
2. Are beastlords valuable to groups?  If so in which role?
3. Are they fun?
4. I know wisdom is important for spell casting etc, but what other stats
are valuable to this class.  Is strength necessary?  Will I be in there
fighting with mobs (post pets)?
5. I know they recently changed how pets are summoned buffed (and cant
zone with you now).  How exactly does that work?
6. Race, which is the preferred race for Beastlords?  Iksars look nice as
they have regen, swim, high wis and a great newbie zone.  Faction hits are
bad, but on the moon, that is no problem.

And any other info would be greatly appreciated.  I am looking to start a
beastlord, they seem pretty neat, but I wanted to get some truthful
information and opinions on them from peopel who actually play one.

Thanks in advance.
