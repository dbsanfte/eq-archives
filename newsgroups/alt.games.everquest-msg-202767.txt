you tell 'em George!

I have had KEI cast on me very few times (currently lvl 36), and believe my
character is better
for it (not to mention the satisfaction you get from all the hard work!).
I didn't realise that it was used by so many lower level players.
Looks like l might be invited to a few more groups now that people have to
rely upon
playing ability!
