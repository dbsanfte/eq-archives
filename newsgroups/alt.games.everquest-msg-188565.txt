First thing, buy SoL.  Your machine should be able to handle the nexus 
(not much to it), and nobody's machine can handle the bazaar, so just 
make sure you're looking at the ground when you zone into it.

If you're still not into buying it, find a trusted friend to do your 
bazaar shopping for you.  A few ideas to look for that should be fairly 
cheap: Blackened Alloy Long Sword; Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword; Giant 
Tree Flayer.  The latter two are 2hs while the former is 1hs.  You might 
also have him look for some velium weapons.

You get dual wield in 2 or 3 more levels.  Til then, stick with 1hs to 
keep it trained, and after that your damage output will probably be a lot 
higher with 1hs than 2hs for a good while.  Also, your epics (eventually 
you'll want 'em) are 1hs, so there's a final reason :P
