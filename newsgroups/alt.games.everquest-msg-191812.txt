  Yeah, it definately took me 4-5 hours to download
LoY on my 56k modem - I just left it downloading
while I went to sleep.

  I didn't have to enter any account key for it.  It was
just automatically enabled the next time I logged in.
But you should have gotten a confirmation box if you
clicked on the buy button - otherwise I assume all you've
done is downloaded the files from the patcher.
