I'm sort of sad to see the announcement that
hell levels are likely to be going away.

I kind of like them.

First, it's nice breezing through post
hell levels in comparison.  Yeah, yeah, I know
this is a bit like the guy who hit himself
with the hammer because it felt so good when he
stopped, but...  Having variability in the
speed of the exp bar really does give a feeling
of relief in, say, levels 46-50 after slogging
through 45.

If they smooth out the level curve, it'll just
be, "every level is worse than the last.  Things
just get harder, then harder again, then harder
still, then even yet harder, level after level
after level..."   Oh, boy...

Hell levels manage to make even a lot of
high-level exp crunches *feel* easier -- four
"easy" levels for one "hard" level seems a
good psychological trade-off.

Secondly, though, and perhaps even more importantly,
hell levels are a good time to "stop and smell the roses".
Because I knew I'd be in each hell level for a while,
I usually took them as a time to take some of the
focus on the "next level brass ring", and spend
some time just exploring, questing, getting my
skills up, and so on -- I wasn't getting out of the
level real soon anyway, so why not?

Hell levels give different levels their own
personality, like a highway with differing terrain
every couple miles.  Smoothing out the exp curve will
make them much more similar to each other, and
more monotonous, without getting you to the end
of the road any faster.

But I suppose I'm in the minority.
