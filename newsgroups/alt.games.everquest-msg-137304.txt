I can't agree more, there is a tactical conspiracy between
good chanters and clerics that you may not be aware of...
clerics consider it their principle job to keep the chanter
alive, and chanters consider it their principle job to keep
the cleric alive.  As long as chanter and cleric are both
alive, things are salvagable.  Lose any other member of
the group and you can still probably get by... or heck,
keep everything mezzed for a minute and rez that dead
guy if you need him so badly!
