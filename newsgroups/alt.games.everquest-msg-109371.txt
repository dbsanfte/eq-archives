    Level 45 is a bit extreme, but when you're low on clerics online and a
target is up any old twink will get pressed into service as long as there's
no level issues, like a nasty AoE. I can't see bringing a 45 cleric to a
Sontalak raid - that's insane. He'll never get to cast.

    Can your clerics count as high as the number ten? Can they make a CH
macro? Have you done any management when you engaged, like hiding from AoEs
/ getting paladins to LoH to get on the Rampage list / getting
offtanks/mezzes in place fast? Do your tanks have all spells turned ON to
avoid the silly CH update bug? If these conditions are met, you have no
excuses beyond a lag bubble that hits the entire raid.

    You Have A Problem.

    "Not paying attention to the small stuff"? There's not many mobs tougher
than the flurry drakes in NToV. Vyemm, Zlex, Lady M, Aary - everything else
is easier, including the named dragons.
