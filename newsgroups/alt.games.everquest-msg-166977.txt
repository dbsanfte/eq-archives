How dare you Ryou! I am surprised you didn't send him the secret fix,
that only players who have completed the rites of McQuaid know.

I will help then, open your computer, stick a big magnet on your HD
with a picture of Sye Sperling the President of the the Hair Club for
Men. He isn't just the President you know, he is a member.

The mobs in your zones will then grow some hair, they will be more
virile, girls will dig them and they will spawn the proper mobs.

If it doesn't work, try doing what Sony tells you to do, go to thier
SUPPORT BOARD at www.everquest.com and not this newsgroup. I ask for
help here too, but with the puzzles of the game and not common issues
like this one listed on Sony's support forums. I have only had two
problems that I haven't found the solution for, on that board.
