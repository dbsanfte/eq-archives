I have to admit, I have the attention span of a gnat. After turning 60 I 
put most of my XP towards AA, and got the title of Baron recently. 
Unfortunately, I'm bored stiff already with that, so I was toying with 
the idea of dinging 61. My usual grinding zones are the yard trash in 
the planes of Disease and Nightmares... When do these start going light 
blue? I was thinking that perhaps the level difference would make me 
more effective in raids and loot-oriented zones such as Kael, without 
hampering my xp too much when I decide to go back to AA. 

What's your views on turning 61?
