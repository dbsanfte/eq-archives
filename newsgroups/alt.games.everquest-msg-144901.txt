Looking for some good places that are relatively safe for this, anyone
have any good suggestions?  Not looking for places we could get groups
so much as we are looking for places we can go as a couple.  

Decided to try Raptor Island (small) in Timorous Deep tonight and
while it had possibilities it went horrible.  Bound in FV we took off
with SoW and Lev and buffs from the small island the boat stops at
from FV (where the Island shuttle comes out).  Well, I was expecting
the commute to take a while and had turned to watch the TV.  Next
thing I know I am running up on shore and trying to pull back from the
raptor close.  Too late, he saw me as did the Viscious Raptor.  With 2
of them we were overwhelmed.  She was going to change a few spells
when we got there but never got the chance.    On CR her ITA dropped
and she got aggro'd while naked.  Reading the beastiary at Alla's is
little help since most who post do so talking about how thier druid or
wizzie can quad them without a problem.  Was I too eager to try this
camp????

We did the Seafuries when we were younger (she 45 to 48 and I 38 to
41) and they went well.  Would also have the benefit of trying to get
the AC camp next door if it opened.

She has also talked about maybe Allizewsaur.  We can certainly use the
gems to get my Epic started.  

We frequently do the Giants behind the fort in GD.  Have considered
doing the EW entrance for Giants in Kael but am not sure if pulling
with an arrow will aggro all of them right there.  We have also done
the IG's in Everfrost but with little else to do there at our
level.....  And the IG's in Perma give us too much problem. 

Moon is a problem as he computer, even with most everything turned off
has problems.  Old Video Card and dial up.

Any other thoughts?

Thanks a ton!
