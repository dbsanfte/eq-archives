I think this is intentional. Both races are ostensibly good-aligned, both 
hail back to the Combine Empire, both even speak some Combine. I think 
Barbarians are meant to view Vah Shir as their long lost cousins. Yes, 
Barbarians have a God, The Tribunal, but its really as neutral a god as you 
can get... divine intervention by committee.

I would imagine Barbarians have OK faction with Vah Shir factions on the 
moon, too.
