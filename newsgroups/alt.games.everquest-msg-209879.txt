Eep!  You're a little young yet, level-wise, to be worrying much about
cleric tips.  At your level you should be mostly soloing, probably all the
way through level 20.

The game has changed drastically since I was a new cleric struggling to
level up, so what worked for me may not work for you.  For example, my
favorite weapon was a Screaming Mace; it cost me 85 plat, which was a
fortune to me then.  I was clad all in banded for the longest time.  These
days, you can get much better weapons in the Bazaar and much better armor.
You job will be to make enough plat to be able to afford them.

There's a series of low-level quests you can run as a High Elf cleric; talk
with people in your starting town to find them.  That will get you initiated
to not only what the town is like, but how quests work in EQ.  Plus you'll
be rewarded with some items which aren't awful for your level.

I guess my only other recommendation at this point is to make sure you work
on your Sense Heading skill.  Spend a few minutes hitting "Sense Heading" as
soon as it refreshes.  Sense Heading maxes out at ((your level)*5) + 5, so
at level 3, Sense Heading maxes out at 20.  Whenever you level up, spend
some time getting Sense Heading maxed - one thing I would do is hit Sense
Heading while fighting a mob.

I would recommend you look at the EQ Clerics message boards:

http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/

They have lots of good advice.

Or you can always look me up in the serverwide age channel.  /join
serverwide.age:age and feel free to ask questions.

Well... if you open up your social actions, you'll see lots and lots of
empty actions.  You can customize these, then assign them to your bank of
hotkeys.  One of your windows should be a 2x5 row of empty squares.  You can
assign social and other actions to these hotkeys, then press one of your
number keys to execute it.  This is something that's easier to do than
explain; if you happen to see me in serverwide.age, ask me for help and I'll
be glad to walk you through setting it up.
