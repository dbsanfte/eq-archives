As such, so does the selection of items in game and in general the
ability of a new player to be able to play a new expansion.

This is one of those things i'd suggest they make a new server and
give it a go. If Firiona Vie can be the droppable server make
Eiv anoiriF the server adhering to your no-drop rules and see how it
works. I think you'll find player progression becomes incredibly
stagnant as a result slanting towards those with 80 hours/week online.
Droppable items in game aren't meant to help the pgamer, sure they can
make money off them... but in usage they're meant to help the new
player.

For that matter.... you could also have a server that allows the 1-1
exchange of money for a new in-game currency that is used to buy
material with. Don't like it? Play your regular server.
