I am putting 10% EXP into AA at level 51, which keeps it ticking over
slowly. One good thing is that when you die you do not lose any AAXP, so
your investment is safe.

Several people I know switched to 100% AAXP when they got close to level 53,
so they can stay in the Nag/Vox limits until they have had enough :)
