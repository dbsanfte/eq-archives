   So I was in the kitchen, munching on some Cashew Lovers Poppycock, when Lenny
calls me over to look at his computer.  He was playing a cleric on test, and
told me to "Watch that orc!"  He cast Root on it, and a mesh of brown ropey
loops came from the ground and surrounded his victim.  He backed up and cast
Smite on it, and the helpless orc was engulfed in a white maelstrom of divine
energy.

   The new effects look very nice, from what I've seen.  I can't imagine that
they will do good things for people dealing with lag issues, though.
