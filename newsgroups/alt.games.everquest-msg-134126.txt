So in effect you are saying that as individuals we should not be allowed
to discern differences in the people we interact with in our daily lives
and respond as our free will would have us?  If I choose not to sit next
to you because you smell of elderberries have I committed a crime in
your eyes?  Thou shalt not discriminate against people of odor!  How
about if I choose not to let you into my house because I consider you to
be a bad example for my children since you have such poor reading
skills?  Have I now discriminated against you even though I was only
protecting my children?  Please, someone, think of the children here!

I think maybe that idea of protecting everything and everyone might not
be such a good idea, but hey, I'm the sort of guy who thinks child
molesters make bad day care providers, that's just me.  Perhaps you
disagree.

Read the post, this scumbag EQ is posting under the name of Tanya Worley. Look
at the headers from the Tanya Worley post this morning, the part that says
"X-Complaints-To: abuse@eqstuff.org" can't be changed by anyone except
"eqstuff.org". That's proof where it came from and that's EQ doing the posting.
