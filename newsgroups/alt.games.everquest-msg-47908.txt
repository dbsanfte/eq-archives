If you think you're impressing anyone, you're not.
All you're doing is proving that your psycho button has
been superglued to the "on" position.

If you see this, I'm not trying to make you angry but...
You should read your post, understand that the type
of person that makes that kind of post is in need
of serious psychological help.   Priorities are
misaligned.

Biz's life is his own business, and if you cannot
accept his opinions neutrally, you are worthless,
a child, a little girl.
