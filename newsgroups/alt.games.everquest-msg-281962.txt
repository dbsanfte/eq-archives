New characters <> New players.

How many of those 30 toons were of "real" newbies, instead of alts of 
people who have been playing for years?

Of those alts, how many are playing without twinking, and even more 
interesting, how many will still be playing, without twinking, wheen 
they are 40?

IMO, there might be one or two "real" newbies out of that thirty, and at 
least 20 those alts will have been abandoned by the time they hit 40 and 
at least 20 of the 30 will have been twinked, either by their mains or 
by the "helpful" assistance of their main's friends and guildmates.

Playing it straight, untwinked and without the assistance of high level 
friends, is an uncommon approach these days... but even that isn't the 
same as "real" newbies, as people with three or four level 65 mains and 
several years of experience at the game simply experience the game 
differently, move thru levels more quickly, and aren't all that likely 
to form lasting friendships with real newbies, because they aren't on an 
equal footing; the experienced pro may end up as a mentor to genuine 
newbies, but a relationship of equals isn't all that likely to form.

EQ as it is today doesn't draw that many genuine newbies, so the few 
that it does draw aren't entering the same community as we did even just 
a couple years back, pre WOW/EQ2, when EQ was gaining as many (or more) 
newbies per year as it lost in retiring old hands.
