You think that waiting for Faelinn is bad, and that fighting the corrupted 
aquagoblin are bad.. you obviously haven't gotten your kedge cave crystals 
yet have you? All I got to say is good luck... I Camped that stupid seahorse 
for 4 days for 5+ hours each day with a 4 peeps (65mag, 65 cle, 62brd, 
58dru) and it took most of that to keep the spawn cleared and not get a 
smack down. I petitioned the fact that in the 4 days not a single named had 
spawned (we were doing all the PHs for the name cycles) and after a guide 
comes and tells us that nothing is wrong, sorry for the wait, not even 10 
mins later.. pop went the corrupted...
