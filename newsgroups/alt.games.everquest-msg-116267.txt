I did my bard again last night (it's my main, but been on hiatus as I've
been in DL and hate it and being a newbie am not too sure where to go), to
check out the new drum and lute graphics and animations.
Cool graphics, no animations...
I have all expansions with all the bells and whistles turned on, save for
music.  Has this been a known bug, or did I just get a bad roll in the
patch?  Not a big deal, I just want to "bang on the drum all day".

TIA,
SEAN...
