With just the trilogy, you will not have beastlord as an option, that was 
added with the Luclin expansion.

As for soloing many classes can solo effectively all the way up to level 
70 and as many AAs as you want to get (I believe you will need Luclin and 
later expansions to get the advanced abilities, but, not an issue until 
level 51 anyway.)

Necromancer is probably the best soloer in the game.  Wizards, once they 
get to a high enough level, are also awesome soloers.  Druids are 
excellent soloers.  Beastlords, as mentioned, are excellent soloers.  
Shaman are great soloers.  Shadowknights are good soloers.  A well played 
bard can be an awesome soloer, but, they have been nerfed some in that 
regard.  Rangers can solo on select mobs all the way to level 70.  
Enchanters can be great soloers.  I am sure I missed some.  Rogues, 
Warriors, Clerics pretty well suck at soloing once you get to higher 
levels (not saying they can't, just that they suck at it).  Paladins are 
marginal soloers at higher levels.

Hmm, who did I miss?  Berzerkers, no clue, but I've heard that somewhere 
in the 50s they start to suck at it.  Mages are very good soloers.
