And that would work how?

My weapon increase, apparently, only effects the amount of damage I can do
with the weapon. I am pretty certain that I don't hit any faster with any
other weapon or even appear to. I timed swings, not hits, this includes my
misses. I did nothing else other than attack with that weapon and ignored
the result if I was stunned.
Unfortunately(?) My SK is no longer low 20's and my warrior sold his
Mith...I'll see if I can duplicate the results in using the log and do it
over a period of time (log won't show the 1/2 a sec difference over 2
swings) but I swear, when I timed it, my lower level SK was swinging the
sword .5 of a sec slower (5 delay) than my higher level warrior was.

As I said in my post earlier, I got more than a little anal about working
out the haste on this item.
