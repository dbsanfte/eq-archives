For a shaman usuable clicky snare:

For a shaman usable proc snare:

There may well be others, my shaman has the first and my cleric the 
second is why they came to mind; I wish it was the other way around as 
my cleric is much more often in a position where a 6 second cast time to 
stop runners would be worthwhile, and my shaman is much more likely to 
be in melee range of a mob, where the branch could proc.

Berg, 65 cleric, Morell Thule
Paax, 52 shaman, Morell Thule
Grage, 55 Berserk with a much better snare than either of the above, Luclin
