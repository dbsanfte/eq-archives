Bards start to DoT well at level 46, when we get our third chant.  A bard 
with Nostrolo Tambourine can do about 1050/minute in DoT damage at that 
point, which is quite a bit of damage, especially when you consider how 
long the range is on our DoT songs.  There is no such thing as risk-free 
exp, but this is pretty close.  I bought SoW potions so that I didn't have 
to twist Selos in, but with the new level 49 150second Selos, it's not 
even an issue anymore, once you make 49.  
A mob like a Greater Spurbone in EJ has 2500hp, so you should be able to 
just kill it in 2.5 minutes or so.  If I was kiting an undead I would 
start tracking to the next mob before the first died, made it possible to 
kill 20/hour or so.
Until level 46 though, charm-kiting is absolutely the way to go.  If the 
mobs you're fighting have high FR or CR, or casts, charm-kiting is still 
probably the best choice.  Like any other soling, it's all about mob 
selection.
