It depends upon the book also...  I know that sounds so dumb, but some books
are only meant for you to pick up from so and so and give to such and
such...  Those books don't open.

Recipe books, fletching books, pottery books and so forth though can be
opened by putting them in an inventory slot (not a bag) and right
clicking...
