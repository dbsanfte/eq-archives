Above 40 its the same as below, you have to choose your targets with a 
bit of thought but you can continue to charm solo.  Outdoors speed boots 
or sow pots are nice and indoors I try to find spots I can use aoe stuns 
without annoying the neighbors.  I've also found some places where 
mez-nuking worked better for me than charming, but I have to agree with 
you the best fun is in making them kill each other.  Glad to hear you 
are having fun with exploring the possibilities.
