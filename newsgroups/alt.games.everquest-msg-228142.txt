My reaction would be, "I can't believe you deliberately tried to scam them."

I have no tolerance for that kind of behavior.  Clearly the buyer was
expecting something else, something quite valuable.  To deliberately set up
a situation where someone can make an expensive mistake is morally repugnant
to my eyes.

Yes, caveat emptor, I know, I know.  That doesn't excuse your guildie's
behavior.  Just because you know you shouldn't be walking through Central
Park at midnight doesn't absolve the mugger of all blame.
