I understand that there's a bit of tongue-in-cheek here, but I think you 
guys may be writing this off too easily. Sure, it's the person at the core 
of the experience that makes the difference, but that person gets better at 
certain activities by practicing those activities, whether in RL or in 
games. Like the surgeons alluded to above who play video games and make 
fewer mistakes, the correlation is there. Who cares which is cause and which 
is effect? All else being equal, I'll take the surgeon who plays and the 
driver who EQ's!
