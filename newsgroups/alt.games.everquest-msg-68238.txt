ALl the models and loading the socials hardly does nothing to worsen
performance at all. The biggest performance all around gainer is to
change textures from medium or high in options to LOW. 

I have all models and social animations on a tnt 16 meg agp, 384 meg
ram p2 400 and with texture quality set to low (which you hardly
notice in playing anyway) its the same for me as with all models and
social animations off (except the initial one time loading period
before character select is longer)
