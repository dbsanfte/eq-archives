Just signed on after the patch with my little level 3 monk and killed
a Deathfist orc in West Freeport.

Got one "Your faction with Deathfist orcs has gotten worse" message,
as usual, but _four_ "Your faction with Deathfist orcs has gotten
better" messages :)  So your faction with them improves as you kill
them...

Hopefully it's just the message and not the actual faction adjustment,
but I /bugged it anyway.

<kidding>
Might be time to log on the main before they fix it though.  Food for
thought....
