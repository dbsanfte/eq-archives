well, i never thought id contribute anything usefull to this group but here
goes,  ou get a paladin, or cleric   to stay on the isle where there wasnt
enough keys , now this pally or cler can have a key to go up afterwards or
do like my guild and keep him there just  to have when we raid there next
then, that pally or cleric groups with a summoning necro, and the person
without a key, they keyless person /duels  someone  dies,  pallie rezzes him
back into POA  then ncro summons,  then  another cleric  rezzes him back to
the corps in the island  that everyone else is,

note: take the people with the keys  a few islands before doing this or it
can get very expensive ;)
