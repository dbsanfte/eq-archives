I just tried that.  I emptied out c:\temp, played EQ for a couple of
hours, and the directory is still there.  Is c:\temp in your path
statement?  Mine isn't, though of course that shouldn't make any
difference.  I note that others are reporting the same problem you
are experiencing.  Weirder and weirder!
