My druid was soloing just fine using this method...no problems whatsoever.
But the downtime was soooo freeaaaaakiiiinnnggg boooorrrrinnnnggg.  I ended
up buying a second account and having Verant move my enchanter to it
(pre-"character move service") SIMPLY for the mana regen.

Even if it was no faster I would still do it, but it was at least as fast.
Druid would snare, root, dot; enchanter dot (then probably root again 'cause
all but one does DD too).  When it gets down to half a couple nukes apiece
would bring it down.  Whoever has the most mana goes to pull again.

Probably not the most efficient/effective, but it was fast enough & safe
enough.  There's lots of good duos out there and druid/enchanter is
certainly on that list.
