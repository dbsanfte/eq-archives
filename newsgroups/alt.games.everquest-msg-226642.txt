I was recently in a games store and made a purchase of everquest (from what
it looks like version 1) for the playstation. It's been a while and thought
I might give it a go. My question is, should I but putting dough into
creating an account with this earlier version? It seems as thought there are
several new versions out there now? It may even seem that this has turned
into a predominately PC based game if it wasn't that originally.

Any quick thoughts?
